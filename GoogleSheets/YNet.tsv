Trump addresses war in Lebanon on social media	A week before Election Day in the U.S., former president and current Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump referred to the war in Lebanon and wrote on social media that: 'During my Administration, we had peace in the Middle East, and we will have peace again very soon! I will fix the problems caused by Kamala Harris and Joe Biden and stop the suffering and destruction in Lebanon. I want to see the Middle East return to real peace, a lasting peace, and we will get it done properly so it doesn’t repeat itself every 5 or 10 years! I will preserve the equal partnership among all Lebanese communities. Your friends and family in Lebanon deserve to live in peace, prosperity, and harmony with their neighbors, and that can only happen with peace and stability in the Middle East. I look forward to working with the Lebanese community living in the United States of America to ensure the safety and security of the great people of Lebanon. Vote Trump for Peace!'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy3n1blw1l	2024-10-30T10:48:54-07:00	
US urges Israel to protect civilian lives, cultural sites in Leba...	The United States on Wednesday urged Israel to protect civilian lives and cultural sites in Lebanon after Israel began heavy airstrikes on the historic city of Baalbek and surrounding villages in the eastern Bekaa region. While the U.S. supports Israel's right to pursue legitimate Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said it was critical its operations do not threaten civilians, especially in densely populated areas such as Baalbek. 'We have made clear that the campaign they are conducting in Lebanon should not, cannot, must not look like the campaign that they have conducted in Gaza. We do not want to see that type of widespread damage,' Miller said when asked about Baalbek at a regular news briefing.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by7000xewje	2024-10-30T10:45:52-07:00

Lifting Iran sanctions, threatening to censure Israel enabled Gaz...	In his new book, 'One Jewish State', former US ambassador to Israel appeals to country’s political left, arguing that Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank offers the best solution for Palestinian welfare and regional stability The road to October 7 began when President Joe Biden entered the White House, according to former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman. Friedman said that if President Donald Trump had still been in office, Israel would not have experienced the deadly attacks and would have achieved more regional alliances through additional Abraham Accords. 'When we left office, Iran was on the verge of bankruptcy,' Friedman, who served under Trump, said. 'Qasem Soleimani, who had been their chief architect of terror, had been eliminated by the United States, imposing great fear and concern on the part of the mullahs. And then Biden comes in.' Friedman criticized Biden for stopping the enforcement of sanctions on countries that trade with Iran, known as secondary sanctions. 'Iran began to sell oil in large amounts to China, to Russia, two of America’s greatest adversaries. Large, specific amounts. There was like a $6 billion gift here, a $10 billion gift there. That seemed to make no sense,' he said. 'So what happened to Iran? Iran more than doubled its GDP in a couple of years by about $200 billion.' He said that Iran used that money to fund its many proxy groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, which are now engaged in a multifront war with Israel. Under a Trump Administration, Friedman said, Iran would not have had the funds to prop up the various proxy groups. He also said that Trump would have continued the momentum of the Abraham Accords, the historic US-brokered agreement normalizing relations between Israel and four Arab nations. 'I think we needed about six months more in our administration to get the Saudis on our side,' Friedman said. He added that Indonesia and 'some of the secondary Gulf nations' were also primed to achieve normalization with Israel. Saudi Arabia, which once seemed to be on the cusp of normalizing relations with Israel, recently held military exercises with Iran. Friedman said that Saudi Arabia would stop cooperating with Iran if Trump is elected and it becomes clear that the US is 'a partner that can push back against Iranian malign activity.' 'What people need to understand about the Abraham Accords is it wasn’t about showing these countries that we could move away from Israel. It was about showing these countries how closely we were aligned with Israel. That’s what made Israel the most attractive partner to the Gulf, that they were rock-solid aligned with the United States,' he explained, noting that once the U.S. relationship with Israel appeared less secure, alliance with Israel became less attractive to Gulf states. Once the U.S. relationship with Israel appeared less secure, alliance with Israel became less attractive to Gulf states Friedman’s book 'Sledgehammer: How Breaking with the Past Brought Peace to the Middle East' was published before the October 7, 2023 attacks. Friedman said that many of the predictions he made in his book came true on October 7. 'What I thought then, and I think what’s been proven to be the case, is that the US-Israel alliance, at its strongest, is the fulcrum upon which you can then expand peace throughout the Middle East,' he said. As it weakens, those opportunities not only become less, but the potential for malign activity and mischief becomes greater.' Biden’s strategy for the Middle East involved showing countries other than Israel that the U.S. was committed to 'equal measures of peace, prosperity, dignity' throughout the entire region, Friedman said. 'They use that phrase, ‘equal measures,’ all the time,' he continued. 'No. No. Israel is the single most important ally of the United States in the Middle East.' He said that broadcasting the centrality of Israel as the US’s ally in the Middle East would increase the chances of peace in the region. Senator Lindsey Graham has pushed for achieving normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel during the Biden Administration. 'I would love to see the details,' Friedman said of Graham’s plan. 'It’s hard to comment on something which is just, at this point, aspirational.' Democrats also recently urged a probe into Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and former White House aide, alleging that he had acted as an agent of Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Friedman described that allegation as 'complete nonsense.' 'Anything Jared Kushner does in that field is done for the good of America, with the support of America,' he said. 'And I hope that he continues what he’s doing, because he developed levels of credibility with Saudi Arabia, with the Emirates, with others in the Gulf, that had never been achieved before.' Earlier this month, a letter sent by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to the Israeli government leaked to the press. In that letter, the U.S. threatens to withhold arms shipments if Israel doesn’t address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Friedman expressed frustration with the Biden Administration’s threat of sanctions on Israel, including an embargo or slowed arms shipments critical for Israel’s defense in the ongoing conflict. He confirmed knowing the specific weapons involved but declined to elaborate, emphasizing his belief that these delays are 'entirely political.' He emphasized the significance of a swift and decisive Israeli victory in its current conflict, framing it as 'essential' not only for Israel but also for the stability of Jordan, Egypt, and moderate Sunni Muslim nations. According to Friedman, US national security interests should support a clear win for moderates over extremists in the region. Turning to US domestic politics, Friedman argued that Michigan holds critical weight in the upcoming 2024 presidential election, suggesting that without Michigan, Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, lacks a path to victory. 'They’re in the process of losing Michigan, and what they did here, I think, was to sway those in Dearborn and other places,' he asserted. Friedman criticized the Biden Administration, asserting that 'politics has infected the national security decisions,' leading to negative consequences. In his view, while President Biden has not demonstrated the capacity to end the conflict swiftly, Trump is seen by some voters as able to achieve that goal, which may influence the election outcome in Michigan. Asked about Trump’s habit of making derogatory comments and offensive statements, Friedman urged people offended by the former president’s words to 'get over it' He noted a recent shift, where a group of Muslim imams endorsed Donald Trump, citing his perceived ability to 'stop the killing' and end the war. He explained that this endorsement didn’t reference Israel directly but suggested urgency in conflict resolution. 'That doesn’t mean that Israel should somehow be held back in its efforts to win the war, but it should be done quickly, decisively, and let’s start the rebuilding process,' he said. Israel will struggle to improve its public image until the war comes to an end, Friedman said. 'Once it’s over, you can make the case, look, this is what we did,' he said. 'This is what had to be done. Efforts were made to minimize civilian suffering. We are rebuilding, and this is what the future will look like. I think in the absence of a vision going forward, it’s hard to get people all that interested in your side of the case.' Friedman said that Trump will likely receive between 30% and 40% of the Jewish vote, which would be a historically high level of Jewish support for the Republican candidate. Many Jews who support Harris simply have priorities other than Israel, Friedman said. 'But then there are others who really just want to self-rationalize the idea that Kamala Harris will be better for Israel or better at fighting antisemitism than Trump,' he said. 'I don’t think there’s any intellectually honest way to get there.' Friedman discussed Trump’s 2019 executive order that expanded Title VI of the US Code to include protections for Jewish students from anti-Semitic conduct at universities. This expansion means that universities receiving federal funding must ensure the safety of their Jewish students or risk losing financial support. 'And almost all universities get some form of federal funding,' he said. According to Friedman, this is an 'enormously important' tool that remains in place under President Biden but is not being enforced. 'You can’t get tenure on a major American university if you’re pro-Israel,' Friedman asserted. 'We’ve seen that over and over again. And this is the breeding ground for the leaders of America for the next 20, 30, 40 years.' He argued that the federal government could pressure institutions like Harvard, Yale, and Columbia by threatening their funding, which he believes would prompt swift changes, saying, 'follow the money, you figure out where the incentives lie.' Friedman highlighted the broader impact of universities as 'the breeding ground for the leaders of America' and described the lack of pro-Israel perspectives in academia as a critical issue for the country’s future. He called for expanding law enforcement, particularly around immigration laws, asserting that many agitators are foreign nationals. While Friedman expressed doubt in changing 'the hearts and minds of anti-Semites,' he emphasized that enforcing existing laws could address these issues. This, he explained, is one of the key measures Trump would prioritize to 'change things very quickly' if reelected, ensuring universities comply with laws protecting Jewish students. Asked about Trump’s habit of making derogatory comments and offensive statements, Friedman urged people offended by the former president’s words to 'get over it.' 'He’s made America a stronger country, a more prosperous country, a more respected country,' he said. 'He’s been able to export American values throughout the world, throughout some of our most challenging places within the world. He’s feared in places like North Korea and Russia. And he stood up to China like no president before or after. You don’t like something he said, get over it.' Friedman said he was 'really nervous' about a world in which Trump isn’t elected. 'Who’s going to deal with making sure Israel has the weapons it needs to defend itself? The only thing Kamala Harris has ever said that’s in favor of Israel is that they have the right to defend themselves,' he said. 'I’d like her to point to any country in the world that, after it’s been attacked, doesn’t have the right to defend itself. It’s a meaningless platitude. Where she goes with that, I don’t know. I don’t think she really believes in the cause, in the ultimate justice of a Jewish state.' In his recently published book, 'One Jewish State: The Last, Best Hope to Resolve the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,' Friedman argues for a one-state solution where Israel would hold sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, the West Bank. This stance marks a shift from his previous support for a two-state solution, though he clarifies that even then, his vision included strict security controls by Israel over Palestinian territories—a model Palestinians rejected. He attributes his change in perspective to several factors: The first factor, he said, was the Palestinian response to the 2020 Trump peace plan, 'which was complete, unadulterated rejection.' 'Then along comes October 7, in which we see the capacity of Palestinians for hatred and brutality,' he said. 'And then you look at the polls of Judea and Samaria, of the Palestinians living there, and the aftermath, where like 80-plus percent of them were in favor of what Hamas did on October 7. So you take the Palestinian rejectionism, their support for October 7, and you then say, OK, this has changed the way I think.' Friedman recalls a pivotal conversation with a secular Israeli entrepreneur who initially seemed indifferent about retaining historically significant areas like Shiloh. After learning about Shiloh’s biblical heritage, the entrepreneur changed his view, affirming the importance of retaining the site. Inspired by this interaction, Friedman wrote his book to appeal to Israel’s political left, presenting his case for Israeli sovereignty as the best path for Palestinian welfare and stability. 'The best outcome is Israeli sovereignty over all of Judea and Samaria, because there is no other governing body,' he said. 'Look around and look around the region. You know, there’s no other governing body that has a track record of empowering an Arab minority other than Israel.' According to Friedman, Israel’s governance has offered opportunities to its Arab citizens, pointing to Arab participation in elite universities, health care, and business in Israel. He argues this model benefits Palestinians more than self-governance, which, he says, was a failed experiment in Gaza, leading to resources being diverted to conflict. 'What did they do with their independence, right? What did they do with the money that was given to them? They squandered it all on terror tunnels and weapons of mass destruction,' Friedman said. 'So why go through this experiment again when Israel has a proven track record of running an Arab minority?' Friedman has not yet presented these ideas to Trump or the moderate Muslim states, noting that his focus is on influencing Israeli opinion. He believes that for any U.S. policy shift, it is crucial to have Israeli consensus on the approach. The book, he adds, was recently translated into Hebrew to broaden its reach in Israel. Friedman’s plan does not provide an answer for the 2 million people living in Gaza. 'It’s a long-term solution,' he said. 'We’re not ready yet for a long-term solution to Gaza. Gaza is entirely a short-term problem. You know, people need houses. They need to eat. I mean, these are issues that, until you deal with them, you don’t deal with the One Jewish State issues.' Despite the ongoing war and the hostages still held in Gaza, Israel is better off now than it was before the war broke out, Friedman said. 'My analogy has always been to take two people who had serious cancer on October 6,' he said. 'They don’t know it yet. They feel fine. But they’ve got cancer growing inside of them. And over the course of the next year, one discovers it, goes through chemotherapy, suffers through it, has a very difficult time. It’s now a year later, not completely out of the woods, but starting to get good test results, starting to get, you know, the PET scans and the CAT scans are showing that the cancer has shrunk. In some cases, it’s been eliminated. The other guy still feels fine, right? Now, you compare these two people a year out, right? In the USA, you’re a life insurance company, right? Who do you want to write a policy on? Who’s healthier?' Similarly, he said, Israel has come to terms with the unsustainable situation on its borders and taken steps to address it. Asked about what role he might take in a new Trump Administration, Friedman expressed his willingness to rejoin the government, especially in the wake of recent events impacting Israel. He described a desire to help Israel heal from the trauma of October 7 and said he would again accept the role as ambassador if Trump is reelected and offers it to him. 'I want to help Israel get back on its feet,' he said, adding that he also hopes to 'help America restore its credibility within the world.' Friedman emphasized his belief that America is uniquely positioned to lead globally, warning that if the US doesn’t take that role, 'the world quickly devolves to a very bad place.' 'I want to help America restore its credibility within the world,' he said. 'Of all the superpowers, regional and worldly, America’s the only country with the values that really make it suitable to lead the world.' -This article is written by Felice Friedson and reprinted with permission from The Media Line Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/ryav00glz1e	2024-10-30T10:34:07-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2020/02/25/HJJ32sMVL/HJJ32sMVL_0_34_800_451_0_small.jpg

Moshe Shimon Roth says the left is using the religious Zionist community's fallen soldiers as a political tool and says that the whole conscription issue is a sham, claiming there is no manpower shortage Knesset Deputy Speaker Moshe Shimon Roth of the United Torah Judaism Party launched a scathing critique of Aliyah and Integration Minister Ofir Sofer from the Religious Zionism party, who stated on Wednesday, 'We’ve been spit in the face by Haredi leadership,' adding that it’s unacceptable that the Haredi community avoids enlistment while 'both Torah students and others are bleeding to death.' Considered relatively moderate on conscription issues, Roth told Kol Berama Radio that, contrary to the claims of IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, 'the whole conscription issue is a sham. There is no manpower shortage; the IDF doesn’t want to draft Haredim. It’s the left that keeps bringing this up, using national religious Israelis as its ‘useful idiots.’' Roth, who is involved in discussions on the military conscription law and serves as chair of the Knesset Ethics Committee and a member of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, added: 'Sofer is very attached to his seat, and that overrides any ideology. Eventually, even he will need something. He just wanted to show his supporters what a debater he is, but that’s the end of the show – he went off to bed.' 'They [the left] do it because the religious and traditional camp is gaining strength, and that bothers the left. They are politicizing the sacrifice of religious Zionists to score points against the Haredim. When these soldiers were alive, the left vilified them for their actions and beliefs, but now they’re using them as tools against the Haredim.' Opposition leaders quickly condemned Roth. Avigdor Liberman, chairman of the right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party, said Roth 'should be ashamed. Calling the national religious community ‘useful idiots’ crosses a red line. National religious Israelis, who combine Torah study with military service and workforce participation, are the salt of the earth and deeply committed to the values of the state and Zionism. It’s time you and your colleagues realize: we’re in an existential battle; everyone must join and enlist.' Likewise, Yesh Atid Knesset member Meirav Cohen criticized Roth, saying: 'When a public official fights to keep his community out of the army – refusing to serve while their own brothers fall –and calls those who do serve ‘useful idiots,’ well…' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1n1ucybkl	2024-10-30T10:08:41-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/30/HkoN11T111Jx/HkoN11T111Jx_0_40_1280_721_0_small.jpg
How inmates in Israeli prison hid cellphones underground	Over 40 mobile devices found in underground spaces and sewage pipes sawed to hide the cellphones; Israel Prison Service warns possible upcoming budget cuts could hinder efforts to prevent future smuggling operations In September 2021, six prisoners escaped from Gilboa Prison, which until then was considered one of Israel's most secure facilities. Following the escape and the ensuing investigative committee, the Israel Prison Service underwent a significant reform, introducing a computerized management system and reinforcing prison security. As part of these measures, concrete was poured into the underground spaces beneath Gilboa Prison, which had been constructed with foundational piles. The project was expanded to other prisons, including Ganot Prison in southern Israel, where approximately 2,500 inmates are held. At the peak of these efforts, it was revealed that prisoners found another use for these 'dead spaces' beneath the cells: hiding mobile phones to maintain contact with the outside world. Currently led by Israel Prison Service chief Kobi Yaakobi, this extensive effort to fortify cells and fill underground spaces with concrete aims to implement recommendations from the government’s inquiry following the Gilboa escape. The committee discovered that some prisons have open spaces beneath the cells – created when the structures were raised on piles – leaving gaps of several dozen centimeters between the ground and the floor. The latest security operations uncovered a particularly clever tactic: Prisoners sawed through toilet pipes to stash magnetic pouches containing mobile phones. Using improvised 'fishing rods' with magnets on the ends, they would retrieve the phones to communicate outside the prison. Despite concerns about budget cuts, the Israel Prison Service warns that the proposed reductions could severely hinder their ability to prevent smuggling operations and implement the Gilboa Prison escape committee’s recommendations. During recent security operations in Ganot Prison, prison staff uncovered over 40 mobile phones hidden under cell floors. Using the new method, prisoners sawed into plumbing pipes, creating hidden compartments for phones and retrieving them with magnetic fishing rods when needed. Chief Warden Hatem Azam, who leads the project, highlighted the sophistication displayed by the prisoners. 'We are facing elaborate tactics, and our actions aim to thwart these attempts and prevent illegal communications. Additionally, we’ve deployed cellular jammers to disrupt any communication. We will continue to detect and seal off these ‘underground cities.’' Southern District Commander Chief Warden Eran Peer expressed concern over possible budget cuts. 'Right at the peak of our fight, the Finance Ministry is considering budget reductions, while we’re uncovering methods that enable security prisoners to communicate from behind bars. National security depends on preventing these smuggling operations. Lives and state security cannot be reduced to a matter of budget.'

Gallant in Gaza: 'Deal to return hostages most important task'	Defense Minister Yoav Gallant entered the Gaza Strip on Wednesday and joined troops deployed in Rafah and the Philadelphi corridor. Gallant was shown the location where Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was eliminated and held an operational situation assessment together with the General of the Southern Command, Commander of the Gaza Division, and additional senior officials. 'In any place where Hamas rears its head, it meets the IDF – whether in Rafah, Khan Younis, or Jabaliya- wherever Hamas rises, it is taken down. Your [military] actions led to the conditions that ultimately caused Sinwar to make a mistake [leading to his elimination],' he told IDF troops. 'The central issue here is to continue exerting as much [military] pressure on Hamas as possible, in order to create the conditions necessary to ensure the return of the hostages. Your duty is to exert military pressure, and eliminate and imprison terrorists.' 'The political echelon must do what is necessary to bring about a deal. You [referring to the troops] must apply military pressure and do what is necessary to create the conditions required for us to carry out a deal. This is our most important mission in Gaza at this time,' he said. 'We have routine tasks as well – defending Israeli communities and troops, and maintaining our freedom of operation in Gaza. You apply pressure – do what is necessary and we will bring about a deal because you created the conditions for us to carry it out, and I hope that we will do it.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk87eay11jx	2024-10-30T07:47:26-07:00

New Hezbollah chief says war goes on in 1st speech	Naim Qassem vows to continue in the path set by his slain predecessor Hassan Nasrallah; says the terror group is defending Lebanon and not working on behalf of Iran Hezbollah's new leader, Naim Qassem, said on Wednesday that the war against Israel will continue. In a prerecorded speech, his first since being named to head the terror group, Qassem said he will continue in the footsteps of his predecessor, Hassan Nasrallah who was assassinated in an Israeli strike on his bunker in Beirut, in September. During his speech rockets targeted the Galilee after barrages that began early in the morning and continued throughout the day. 'I thank Hezbollah for giving me this responsibility, which is a heavy load and a sign of trust. The blood of our leader will remain and strengthen our resolve to continue on this path,' he said. Qassem said support for Gaza was necessary to deal with the threat Israel poses to the entire region. 'Israel does not need an excuse for its aggression,' he said. 'History has proven that.' He said Hezbollah was not asking for a cease-fire. 'If the enemy wants to stop, we will accept terms that are suitable to us. Any solution will be through negotiations,' he said. U.S. Mideast envoy Amos Hochstein and Special Presidential Envoy Brett McGurk were scheduled to arrive in the region on Thursday, to advance a cease-fire deal that would end the fighting on the Israeli-Lebanon border. The 71-year-old cleric said that Hezbollah was fighting Israel to defend Lebanese territory and not on behave of any foreign influence, alluding to Iran, the group's main benefactor. He said Iran'supports us but doesn't want anything' in return.

Ukraine has received only 10% of latest approved aid from US, Zel...	Ukraine has received only 10% of U.S. military aid approved by Congress earlier this year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video released on Wednesday. Russia, which sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine Ukraine in February 2022, has accelerated its advances in the east and Kyiv's military is outgunned and outmanned by its more powerful foe. Ukraine is also bracing for what could be the toughest winter of the war after long-range Russian airstrikes destroyed what officials says is about half of its power generating capacity. A $61 billion aid package from the United States, stalled by Republicans in Congress from December last year, was approved in April.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1aoz6ywkl	2024-10-30T06:29:45-07:00	
Mass evacuations from Lebanese towns amid explosions from IDF att...	Two farmers injured by rocket from Lebanon targeting Metula, as Israeli forces warned Lebanese towns of imminent danger, urging evacuation; From an environmental standpoint, there is significant damage to forests throughout northern Israel, with long-term recovery needed for affected wildlife and vegetation Two farmers sustained injuries, ranging from mild to moderate-severe, on Wednesday morning due to a direct rocket strike launched from Lebanon targeting Metula. They were taken to Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa for treatment. Concurrently, IDF's Arabic spokesperson, Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, issued an evacuation warning to residents of Baalbek, Ain Borday and Dours in eastern Lebanon, prompting a massive exodus. Later on Wednesday, huge explosions and large amounts of smoke were seen and heard in Baalbek. Adraee's message stated: 'Urgent notice to the residents of Baalbek, Ain Borday, and Dours. IDF is taking strong action against Hezbollah interests in your towns and villages and does not wish to harm you. To ensure your safety, you must immediately evacuate your homes and move beyond the towns and villages via the following routes: Zahle-Baalbek Road; Nahla-Baalbek Road; Al-Arz-Baalbek Road, as outlined on the map. Proximity to Hezbollah operatives, its facilities, or weaponry may expose you to danger.' Following the evacuation announcement, Sky News in Arabic reported on the mass departures from the Baalbek area and other regions identified in Adraee's notice. The governor of Baalbek said in an interview with Sky News in Arabic that 'there is no military presence of Hezbollah' within Baalbek and urged residents to head toward the northern district, adding that 'panic has spread among the residents after the evacuation warnings.' In the afternoon, IDF spokesperson reported that Air Force fighter jets, guided by intelligence from Military Intelligence, the Air Force, and Northern Command, attacked the Nabatieh area and eliminated Mostafa Ahmed Shhadi, the deputy commander of Hezbollah's Radwan Force. In his former roles, he was responsible for operations in Radwan during the Syrian conflict from 2012 to 2017 and managed the unit's combat plans in southern Lebanon. 'Mustafa Ahmad Shihadi advanced terror plots against the State of Israel. This elimination further cripples the operational capabilities of Hezbollah's Radwan Force to execute terror activities against Israeli forces and the Israeli home front on the northern border, particularly the plan to conquer the Galilee,' the report stated. Meanwhile, the Lebanese 'Al-Mayadeen' network, affiliated with Hezbollah, reported an aerial strike on a vehicle on the Al-Kahhala Araya road in the Mount Lebanon area. According to the Lebanese 'Al-Jadid' channel, one person was killed in the vehicle attack. Minutes earlier, a separate report in Lebanon detailed another vehicle attack using a drone in the nearby village of Shamoun. Earlier in the morning, minor damage was reported at a factory building in Nahariya, where aviation components are manufactured, after a drone exploded nearby. The IDF is investigating why no alert was triggered at the site. Prior to this, IDF spokesperson updated that the Air Force intercepted three drones that penetrated from Lebanon after sirens activated in Nahariya and communities in the western Galilee. It was further reported that there were no casualties in the incident, although a fire broke out near the Gesher HaZiv area. In the meantime, the Jewish National Fund (KKL) released data on Wednesday indicating the extent of damage caused by Hezbollah fire since the war began. Approximately 43,243 acres of natural land were burned in the Upper Galilee-Golan Heights region, which suffered the most damage. They estimate that rehabilitation will take between five to seven years. In the Lower Galilee-Gilboa, slightly more than 6,100 acres of open and forested areas were burned, according to KKL data. In the Western Galilee-Carmel region, approximately 2,224 acres were burned, and in the Hula Valley, approximately 178 acres. 'KKL emergency teams, alongside firefighting and rescue crews, continue to lead the fight against fires in the north, even under fire,' said KKL Chairperson Yifat Ovadia-Luski. 'The war has caused severe damage to the residents of the north, and unfortunately also to wildlife and vegetation. Our primary mission for the new year is to rejuvenate the affected areas and the entire State of Israel.' KKL also noted that the fires impacted a wide variety of wildlife: many bird nesting sites were destroyed, habitats of mammals and reptiles living on the ground were burned, and a large number of arthropods could not escape the flames. The damage to vegetation, they noted, is severe. All forest and woodland trees, including conifers like pine, cypress, and cedar, as well as broadleaf trees such as oak, terebinth, Judas tree, eucalyptus, carob, and almond, were affected by the fires. Additionally, public spaces like parking lots, lookout points, scenic viewpoints, forest entrances, and scenic routes were also burned. 'They want to make a 'lame' agreement' Northern municipal leaders addressed the potential settlement in the north, as revealed on Tuesday by Ynet and 'Yedioth Ahronoth.' Eitan Davidi, chairman of Moshav Margaliot, said: 'We want the war to end, but this is not the way. Israel is attempting to reach an agreement that would allow residents in southern Lebanon to return to their homes, and at some point, we could live amicably with our neighbors, but that's not the situation.' He stated, 'This neighborhood doesn't work, the concept doesn't work. The State of Israel needs to change its approach.' Davidi warned that if such a settlement is implemented, 'we will protest.' He added: 'I suggest to the Chief of Staff and the Northern Command Commander to focus on restoring security and achieving results within Lebanon. They want to make a 'lame' agreement.' Shimon Guetta, head of the Ma'ale Yosef Regional Council, said in an interview with Ynet: 'We need to end this once and for all. We are eager to return to our homes, but to return safely. The residents will not return easily. People have been outside their homes for a year.'

Espionage scandal rocks Italy, Mossad implicated	Private security firm alleged to steal information on leaders, public figures in years of hacking, to sell to customers; Mossad agents reportedly seek to trade information on illegal deals with Iran for info on Russian hackers, Wagner Group An internal espionage scandal is rocking Italy after a private investigation firm made up of current and former senior members of the security services was alleged to have stolen personal information on politicians, including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and public figures for extortion. Israel's Mossad was alleged to have been involved in deals with the Milan-based investigative firm. At least four people were under arrest and dozens more were under investigation. Cyber security experts and hackers may have breached the servers of Italy's interior ministry, investigators said. Meloni described the alleged plot as 'unacceptable' and 'a threat to democracy.' Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto demanded an urgent parliamentary probe, out of concern that state secrets may have been compromised. He said the personal information that was exposed is the tip of the iceberg. Italian media described the affair as a conspiracy of the highest level that involves members of the mafia and officials in the intelligence services along with foreign intelligence services including the Mossad. A former senior member of the police who heads Equalize, the private investigation firm is the primary suspect in the investigation and is accused of breaching the servers of government ministries and the police, since 2019 and until 2024, to build massive files, packed with secrets and sensitive information which he sold or planned to sell to his clients. Most of the firm's clients are large companies or major law firms who were interested in access either to gain an advantage over competitors, to succeed in court cases or for extortion. According to a report in the Corriere Della Sera on Wednesday, investigators intercepted a visit to the investigation firm, by two unidentified Israelis who were described as intelligence agents, who wanted to deal in information regarding Iranian gas that may be of interest to Italy's government gas company, ENI and pertained to illegal trade in gas with Iran. The paper also said that the visit was coordinated by a senior member of the police who worked for Italian intelligence, Mossad's counterpart, a man identified as Lorezo De Marcio, and that the Israeli agents asked help in identifying the actions of Russian hackers and Russian bank transactions connected to the notorious Wagner Group, led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, Putin's former ally who was reportedly assassinated after he led a mutiny against the Russian military. The Open website claimed the Israelis asked to stop funding of Prigozhin by Russian oligarchs and offered the Italian firm classified information on illegal purchases of gas from Iran and a payment of one million euros. According to the website, the Vatican was involved in assisting the action against Russia.

US Marines complete first drill using Iron Dome interceptors in I...	Drill included a radar-based system and an American command-and-control center testing capabilities of Iron Dome in part of a new U.S. Army project The U.S. Marine Corps has completed its first live-fire training exercise using an air defense system incorporating Israel’s Iron Dome air defense system, the Defense Ministry said on Wednesday. The drill was carried out successfully, featuring a radar-based system and an American command-and-control center, alongside the Iron Dome interceptor missile and a mobile launcher developed by Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems in collaboration with the U.S. company Raytheon. During the exercise, the Marines operated the system in full, intercepting targets within the area. Additionally, the exercise evaluated the continuous launch capability of Iron Dome interceptors from a mobile launcher designed specifically for the U.S. Marine Corps. The Defense Ministry said in a statement that this exercise was part of a development and procurement project headed by the U.S. Marines to test a prototype for a new medium-range interception system. The Iron Dome interceptor, known as the 'Tamir,' which was used in the exercise, can intercept cruise missiles, drones, and a variety of rockets, shells and mortars. 'The live-fire exercise’s success represents a key milestone toward operational deployment of the Marines' first prototype battery,' the ministry said in a statement.

After demeaning photos appear, detained Palestinians speak out	Hundreds of men stripped of their shirts seen in images on social media after being detained by troops during the fighting in Gaza; IDF says it acted in accordance to international law and was searching for Hamas terrorists among the civilians Hundreds of Palestinians detained by troops in Gaza were seen in photos on social media, stripped of their shirts. The demeaning photos prompted condemnation from media outlets but the IDF said it was acting according to international law and the men were told to strip to ensure that they were not strapped with explosives. 'The men were instructed to remove their clothes and stay in just their underwear,' on man told CNN. We complied. We sat in the cold for several more hours and the weather was frigid. They were insulting us during that time, calling us names, laughing and taking pictures.' According to the report, the image, taken last Friday, was initially shared on an Israeli Telegram channel. It was also noted that the individuals in the photo had tried to leave the area following a warning from the IDF that there will be fighting there. Temperatures in Gaza were in the high 20's C for most of the day. CNN reported that it was unclear who had taken the picture, though some of those photographed claimed it was IDF soldiers who photographed them during their detention. A CNN correspondent spoke with five of those in the image. Muhannad Khalaf, 27, said he and his wife were detained by IDF soldiers while attempting to flee their home with their infant son via what was described as a designated safe corridor. 'We were all gathered in one place – men, women, children, and the elderly. This was at 11 a.m. After five hours, at 4 p.m., they asked the women and children to move forward and carry all (of our) bags and belongings,' he told the outlet. 'Once they left, the men were instructed to remove their clothes and stay in just their underwear. We complied. We sat in the cold for several more hours and the weather was frigid. They were insulting us during that time, calling us names, laughing and taking pictures,' he added. According to Khalaf, every five men in the photo were asked to move forward for an ID screening by the soldiers before being allowed to proceed toward Gaza City. 'Some individuals were detained while others were released. Most of us ended up in Gaza City. The situation was terrifying and deeply saddening as we witnessed elderly men and injured individuals in distress, with no one showing them compassion or mercy.' According to CNN, the image shows a three-and-a-half-year-old girl named Jouri Abu Ward riding a bicycle alongside her father as they made their way to Gaza City. Her father, Mohamad Abu Ward, said, he was forced to strip down to his underwear and was held for eight hours. He said the girl was not required to remove her clothes but was unable to leave the area because she was alone with him. No food or water was available to them. His wife and other children left the area earlier in the morning and were able to make it to Gaza City. 'Individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist activity are being detained and questioned,' the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit told CNN in a statement. 'The detainees are treated in accordance with international law but it is often necessary for terror suspects to hand over their clothes so that their clothes can be searched and to ensure that they are not concealing explosive vests or other weaponry.' 'Due to security protocol, clothes aren’t immediately returned to the detainees,' the statement added, adding the clothes are returned as soon as it’s 'possible to do so.'

Spain flash floods kill at least 51 people	Torrential rains leave roads and towns under water in Valencia leaving some people stranded; Madrid send troops to assist in the rescue efforts At least 51 people have been killed in flash floods sweeping the eastern Spanish region of Valencia following torrential rains on Tuesday that left roads and towns under water, local authorities said on Wednesday. Dozens of videos shared on social media overnight appeared to show people trapped by the floodwaters, with some climbing into trees to avoid being swept away. Carlos Mazon, the regional leader of Valencia, told a press conference some people remained isolated in inaccessible locations. Frantic residents searched for missing relatives while local rescue services struggled to respond to the urgent demand. The government in Madrid deployed 1,000 military troops to assist in the rescue efforts after an astounding 491 mm. of rain fell in 8 hours, the most since 1966, according to Spain's RTVE network. Emergency services urged citizens to refrain from any kind of road travel and to follow further updates from official sources. Spain's state weather agency AEMET declared a red alert in Valencia, with some areas such as Turis and Utiel recording 200 mm (7.9 inches) of rainfall. Meteorologists warned that the extreme weather occurrences will likely increase amid rising global temperatures.

Israel disables most of Iran's air defenses, official says	Israel's destroys key S-300 missile systems and radar sites; Satellite images reveal extensive damage to the Shahrud Space Center, a pivotal Revolutionary Guards facility used for satellite launches and missile production Israel succeeded in taking out most of Iran's air defenses during its attack last Saturday, an official said in an interview with Fox News late on Tuesday. According to the network's sources, Israel destroyed three of Iran's S-300 systems, after a fourth was targeted in the first Israeli strike last April Satellite imagery has revealed significant damage to the Shahrud Space Center, a key launch site for Iran's Revolutionary Guards located in the Semnan province in northeastern Iran, allegedly inflicted by Israel. The operation reportedly also targeted multiple radar systems critical to Iran's ballistic missile capabilities. In a message to Tehran, IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi warned that any further Iranian missile barrages would be met with unprecedented Israeli military responses. Visiting the squadrons responsible for the Iran strike at Ramon Air Force Base, Halevi said, 'We will know how to hit very, very hard in both capabilities and locations that we left aside this time.' The Associated Press unveiled new satellite images showing additional damage at another site targeted by the Israeli assault, a fact unreported by Tehran. Images reveal destruction at several buildings within the Shahrud Space Center. Although Iran has acknowledged damage in Tehran and the provinces of Ilam and Khuzestan, it remains silent about Semnan. Expert analysis suggests that while there is no definitive evidence the damage was not caused by other means, pre-strike imagery shows no such destruction. Captured by Planet Labs, the satellite images from Tuesday depict a central structure at the space center, now a skeletal ruin. Nearby vehicles, likely belonging to Iranian officials, survey the wreckage. Pre-strike images from March show the building intact, topped by a high blue roof. Further images reveal three smaller structures demolished south of the main building, with additional damage to a hangar to the northeast, indicating precise targeting by the Israeli military. Iran is presumably still assessing the full extent of the damage from this calculated strike.

US envoys arrive to advance Lebanon cease-fire	Israeli terms include freedom to operate in South Lebanon if UNIFIL fails to prevent Hezbollah's return to areas south of the Litani; Hezbollah says will not disarm and is prepared to fight on U.S. envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk will arrive on Thursday as efforts to secure a cease-fire deal in Lebanon, advance. Hochstein was in the region last week and will now return as both sides show serious intentions to finalize a deal. Israeli officials said an agreement in Lebanon is tied to the discussions held between CIA chief William Barns and Egyptian and Qatari mediators attempting to reach a hostage release and cease-fire deal for Gaza. Officials in Jerusalem said that some of Israel's conditions could prove difficult for Lebanon to accept, including the demand that the IDF be able to operate freely in South Lebanon to ensure compliance with the terms agreed. Israel insists that if the UNIFIL force is unable to enforce the deal, the IDF be able to take action to ensure the safety of the residents in the north, after the peacekeepers failed to enforce UN resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War and allowed Hezbollah terrorists to return to the border with Israel and build fortifications there in advance of their planned invasion of the Galilee. Israel also demands that the Lebanon army complete the destruction of all Hezbollah infrastructure in South Lebanon, after the IDF withdraws, and ensures no members of the terror group remain south of the Litani River. Jerusalem also demands that measures be in place to prevent Hezbollah from re-arming with weapons smuggled across Lebanon's border with Syria, provided by Iran. The Hezbollah-affiliated Al Khbar newspaper published on Tuesday, the demands of the terror group for the cease-fire including maintaining the link between the war with Israel and Hamas's war in Gaza. 'Hezbollah hopes all Lebanese understand that disarming is not an option,' the paper wrote. Hezbollah also rejects changing the makeup of UNIFIL troops except for the removal of Germans 'because they are partners with the enemy.' Israel has asked that its European allies dedicate troops to the peacekeeping mission. 'Israel wants to continue the war,' Hezbollah officials told the paper. 'We must be prepared for a prolonged fight.' The terror group also said they were not affected by the wave of assassinations of leaders.

Beyond UNRWA: How does Israel plan to coordinate Palestinian aid ...	UN officials and foreign leaders condemned Israel’s plan to ban the UN’s Palestinian refugee organization, but Israeli politicians say that doing say is necessary for the country’s security If the bills passed Monday night by the Israeli parliament are implemented, the United Nations agency supporting Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank could be banned in Israel by February 2025. The plan, which is expected to be implemented in 90 days, would shift responsibilities from the organization known as UNRWA to other international aid organizations. Israeli lawmakers say the change aims to create a foundation for a more peaceful and productive relationship with Palestinians in Jerusalem and neighboring areas. Founded in 1949, UNRWA provides education, health care, and aid to millions of Palestinians in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Israel’s tenuous relationship with the agency became even more strained after the October 7 attacks, in which at least 12 Gaza UNRWA employees were found to have been involved. Israel later discovered evidence that at least 1,200 UNRWA employees in Gaza—10% of its Gaza workforce—were operatives of Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad. A bill banning state authorities from having any contact with the UNRWA and stripping all UNRWA workers of their diplomatic privileges and immunity passed the Knesset 87 to 9. 'I hope for a better education system in Palestinian society—one that teaches peace, not hate' 'I hope the Palestinians will see a weakened Hamas and weakened radical forces,' lawmaker Dan Illouz, who co-authored the bill, told The Media Line. 'I hope for a better education system in Palestinian society—one that teaches peace, not hate—and then, a move forward. It might be a very slow move forward, but toward a more constructive Palestinian society that yearns for peace, not war.' Lawmaker Sharren Haskel co-authored a second bill barring UNRWA from operating in Israeli territory. That bill passed 92 to 10. 'To protect our people, we have to change things, and it starts with UNRWA' 'I knew nine years ago that if UNRWA remained at the core of the Israeli-Arab conflict, there could be no different future,' Haskel told The Media Line. 'I knew it would lead to death and destruction. I didn’t imagine it would pave the way to a massacre like the one on October 7. To protect our people, we have to change things, and it starts with UNRWA.' Haskel’s bill would ban UNRWA from operating in East Jerusalem. A minority of the Palestinian students in East Jerusalem attend schools run by UNRWA, which are not associated with the Jerusalem municipality of the Israeli Education Ministry. Students at these schools study only in Arabic and follow the same curriculum as children in Gaza. Getting rid of UNRWA schools in East Jerusalem would be the most significant result of the bill, allowing a new generation of Palestinian East Jerusalemites to become more integrated into Israel society, Haskel said. The two bills were brought for a second and third reading Monday night, marking the start of the Knesset’s winter session. Both bills aim not only to remove UNRWA from Israel but also to sharply restrict its activities in Gaza and the West Bank. Israel will no longer issue entry permits for UNRWA workers from those territories or have the Israeli military coordinate on UNRWA operations. Lawmaker Boaz Bismuth, who co-authored one of the bills, described the organization as 'an aid agency for Hamas.' 'UNRWA is not a refugee aid agency,' he said. Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Chair Yuli Edelstein said that Israel has 'the right and duty, as any sovereign nation committed to its survival, to combat threats against it, especially when they lie at its very heart.' Palestinians will still receive aid, lawmakers say Illouz explained that other international aid organizations are expected to support Palestinians as UNRWA is phased out. Potential alternatives include UNICEF, the United States Agency for International Development, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Food Programme, and others. The Palestinian Authority could also take over some responsibilities from UNRWA. 'These are organizations that work worldwide in all conflict zones,' Illouz explained. 'It is only in the case of the Palestinians that there is this unique organization that deals with only one conflict. This is toxic, not constructive, and not conducive to peace. We want to return to the internationally accepted norm in all other conflicts.' Haskel noted that the recent polio vaccination campaign in Gaza, a collaborative effort between WHO and UNICEF, ran smoothly. She emphasized that Israel wants to ensure that aid can enter the Palestinian territories and get to those in need. Aid not coordinated through UNRWA is more likely to reach those it’s intended for, she said, noting that diverted UNRWA aid bags had allegedly been found in the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s Gaza hideout. Illouz said he expects funding to be redirected from UNRWA to other aid organizations as needed. 'At the end of the day, the international community will need to decide if they care more about actual humanitarian aid for the Palestinians or strengthening this terror-supporting organization,' he said. 'That’s a decision they’ll have to make. I hope they make the right one.' He also called on the UN to change its definition of Palestinian refugees, noting that UNRWA now serves 5.8 million Palestinian refugees, up from the 750,000 it was originally tasked with serving. Critics of UNRWA often point to the ballooning number of Palestinian refugees as a sign of the agency’s ineffectiveness, but UNRWA rejects the idea that Palestinian refugees are held to a more lenient standard than other refugees served by the UN. 'There is no basis to question the reality that Palestine refugees have for generations been compelled by circumstances to retain their refugee status,' then-UNRWA spokesperson Chris Gunness wrote in 2011. 'Such questions betray a lack of understanding of the international protection regime and serve only to distract from the need to address the real reasons for the protracted Palestinian refugee situation, namely the absence of a negotiated solution to the underlying political issues.' Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UNRWA, called the Knesset’s decision 'unprecedented' and 'dangerous,' adding that it violated international law. He also said that the bills 'will only deepen the suffering of Palestinians.' Similarly, UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that the decision would have 'devastating consequences.'

Palestinian Authority reels at bill banning UNRWA in Israel	International and Palestinian bodies harshly condemn Jerusalem for passing controversial law banning UN aid organization activities in the country; repercussions expected in ICJ case against Israel Palestinian Authority officials condemned the legislation of the bill to ban UNRWA activities in the country on Monday. 'The Israeli decision regarding UNRWA’s work requires an Arab and international stance dedicated to protecting and supporting the agency’s role,' Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Executive Committee Secretary-General Hussein al-Sheikh said in a posted on X. 'The UN Security Council must compel Israel to implement international decisions. Silence on the massacres committed against Palestinians and on what UNRWA has been exposed to is a disgrace for those who agreed to restrict their position to statements, condemnations and denunciations only,' he wrote. The Palestinian Authority (PA) has been in severe economic straits since the beginning of the Gaza war, teetering on the brink of collapse after Israel was withholding clearing funds which make up 65% of its annual budget. Palestinian officials noted that without an immediate solution for the 'void that UNRWA will leave behind, specifically in the education system,' the PA would struggle to meet the needs of students and teachers. 'Israel is tying our hands and feet,' a senior PA official said. 'We have no way to address all the issues UNRWA handled and supported without UN funding and aid unless Israel intends to fill that void through financing.' Fatah Deputy Chairman Mahmoud al-Aloul stressed the international community’s need to take 'urgent action' to force Israel to repeal the law and warned of its 'negative consequences.' 'The law reflects Israel’s systematic intent to end UNRWA’s role and replace it with other agencies, in a move aimed at eliminating the Palestinian refugee issue and revoking their right to return,' he said. 'Refugees’ right to return is guaranteed by international law and can’t be circumvented by Israeli methods.' Al-Aloul accused the Israeli law of 'blatantly violating the UN Charter and contradicting international resolutions — foremost among them Resolution 302 which mandates the establishment of UNRWA, as well as the recent Security Council resolution calling for the protection of humanitarian institutions and their staff.' UNRWA was established by a UN General Assembly resolution in 1949 and is authorized to provide aid and protection to Palestinian refugees in its five operational areas: Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. 'We provide assistance, protection and support for over 5.9 million Palestinian refugees,' UNRWA wrote on its main Arabic website alongside a statement from the agency’s Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini, calling to 'stop Israel’s violent campaign against us.' The laws halting UNRWA’s operations in Israel were approved partly due to the involvement of some agency members in the October 7 massacre. 'There is no question that individuals accused of criminal acts, including the deplorable assault on Israel, must be investigated,' Lazzarini said. 'This is exactly what the United Nations is doing. Those individuals must be held accountable through criminal prosecution and, if found guilty, punished.' He said the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the top investigative body in the U.N. system, is overseeing this inquiry. 'It is looking into allegations against 19 out of 13,000 UNRWA staff members in Gaza. To date, one case was closed because there was no evidence. Four cases were suspended because the information was insufficient to proceed. Another 14 cases remain under investigation. But we must distinguish the behavior of individuals from the agency’s mandate to serve Palestinian refugees. It is unjust and dishonest to attack UNRWA’s mission on the basis of these allegations.' Several governments worldwide, including France, were quick to condemn the legislation. 'Paris deeply regrets the approval of laws aimed at banning UNRWA’s operations in Israel. The implementation of these laws would have severe consequences for the already catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territories, depriving hundreds of thousands of civilians of essential aid, including shelter, healthcare, education and food,' France’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. 'For more than 70 years, UNRWA has been playing a vital, indispensable role in providing essential goods and services to Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, but also in the countries that have taken them in – Lebanon, Jordan and Syria,' it added. 'France reaffirmed its support for UNRWA, pledging that it will 'continue to ensure the implementation of the necessary reforms to guarantee its neutrality, specifically the recommendations contained in the Colonna Report.' Repercussions at The Hague The new legislation mandates Israel’s complete severance of ties with UNRWA. The immediate effect means that should UNRWA staff request visas, Israel’s Foreign Ministry won’t cooperate, indirectly impacting their immunity. Israeli officials estimate Palestinian officials will leverage this legislation against UNRWA in the genocide lawsuit South Africa filed against Israel at the Hague. The legislation has triggered a serious crisis in Israel’s relations with the UN, though it’s important to note the UN consists of many bodies. Israel maintains reasonably good relations with UNICEF, the International Red Cross and the UN World Food Program. Bodies with which it has friction include UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who has one more year in office, UNRWA and UN Women. Guterres will likely use the legislation as a lever against Israel. He and Lazzarini framed the legislation as a blow to the multilateral system and a dangerous precedent — but this is misleading, as there’s no other organization in the world similar to UNRWA that perpetuates refugee status indefinitely.

Up to 14 hostages freed, 30 day lull, latest cease-fire proposal	Deal being discussed by Mossad chief and Qatari mediators says all women held hostage to be freed along with elderly; Egypt proposes a smaller deal to jumpstart the process with Hamas after Sinwar's killing Mossad Chief David Barnea and Qatari mediators drafted a proposed deal to be negotiated with Hamas that would see the release of all women held by Hamas in Gaza and the elderly hostages in exchange for a 30-day lull in the fighting and the freeing from Israeli jails of an undisclosed number of Palestinian prisoners. The offer does not include an Israeli withdrawal from the Strip. The U.S. and Qatar were considering a guarantee to Hamas that the IDF troops would pull out after all hostages were freed, despite Prime MInister Benjamin Netanyahu's insistence on maintaining troops along the border with Egypt. Efforts were underway to bring Hamas back to the negotiating table even for a 'small deal' to test the terror group's position after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar earlier this month. Proposals on offer involve four hostages released in exchange for a two-week ceasefire, followed by a temporary pause to ponder peace. Prime Minister Netanyahu, however, claimed no such offer was made adding that he would have accepted such a proposal. Hamas, meanwhile, eyes Egypt not merely as a neighbor but as a gateway—a portal to renewed diplomatic ties under the watchful eyes of newly minted intelligence chief Hassan Rashad. This rapprochement comes after a frosty chapter with Rashad's predecessor, Kamal Abbas. And then there is the Russian proposal—two hostages with dual citizenship, Alexander Trofenov and Maxim Harkin, become the focal point of Moscow's diplomatic efforts. Hamas number 2, Mousa Abu Marzook was in Moscow, but it remains unclear—whether this would be part of a broader agreement. With the U.S. presidential elections taking place next week, there’s doubt whether any deal can be agreed before Americans go to the polls. After the elections, the pressure on Netanyahu promises to be relentless, regardless of who the next president will be.

According to one of the bill’s authors, MK Boaz Bismuth, this legislation has been a long time coming. 'If we say that what was before October 7 won’t be the same after, then this [ban] is one thing Israelis are expecting: That terror organizations, like UNRWA, will not operate from Israel,' Bismuth told ILTV.

Rafael chief says laser interception systems is a gamechanger	New air defense system against rockets, mortars, cruise missiles, and even drones is the future: 'This is the world’s first laser weapon, and it will work seamlessly with Iron Dome, 'Yuval Steinitz says; So how does the system work, and what will it cost? 'This is the first laser system of its kind in the world, a global breakthrough—not just for Israel—that allows us to intercept missiles, rockets, shells, and drones kilometers away from the country using lasers,' said former minister and Rafael Chairman Yuval Steinitz on Sunday. The timing of the announcement amid wartime holds special significance, he noted: 'Most of our employees at Rafael are highly skilled scientists who could work elsewhere, but here, they feel they’re contributing to the national effort.' Israel’s Defense Ministry announcement effectively ends an international race among world powers, who have spent years attempting to develop a laser-based defense system. This breakthrough was made possible by scientific advancements at Rafael six years ago, which allowed the laser beam to stay consistent upon contact with the atmosphere without scattering. Rafael expects the system to be operational by 2025, adding another layer to Israel’s air defense against missile threats during wartime. 'The system is composed of hundreds of laser beams directed at an incoming target,' Steinitz explained. 'Laser is a highly focused and powerful beam with immense energy that can cut through steel at close range. However, when it encounters air, it tends to scatter. Our scientists at Rafael solved this by sending hundreds of laser beams toward a target tens of kilometers away, enabling us to detect in seconds—based on the beams' return—which hit the missile most accurately. The system then instantly redirects all beams to that precise point for effective targeting. It happens in a flash, within milliseconds. Once all beams lock onto the most accurate frequency, the missile can be neutralized.' Using sophisticated targeting technology similar to Iron Dome’s advanced systems, the laser system calculates the most effective beam for detonating the incoming missile, focusing the rest of the beams on that exact impact point to bring it down. 'The hit range will be about 10 centimeters,' Steinitz noted. 'It will slice through the missile’s steel casing, penetrate its warhead, and strike the explosive with such force that it will detonate.' When fully operational, the Iron Beam system will complement Israel’s existing air defense network, already one of the most advanced globally thanks to Iron Dome, the Arrow missile, and David’s Sling. This laser-based system provides Israel with a strategic and economic advantage, reducing interception costs significantly. 'Right now, each interceptor missile costs taxpayers a fortune,' Steinitz explained. 'But the Iron Beam intervention will cost the state only a few thousand dollars per use, thanks to the laser-based system instead of missiles. It’s a major difference. The cost of a single interception will be around five dollars, a massive shift. It reverses the current equation of intercepting cheap missiles with expensive countermeasures.' Rafael declined to go into further details, but for now, it appears the system won’t defend against ballistic missile attacks, like the one seen from Iran earlier this month. However, Rafael assures it will work effectively against other aerial threats from neighboring regions that have intensified in recent years. 'The system will be deployed alongside Iron Dome batteries,' Steinitz added, 'and depending on the threat type, it will decide whether to use an Iron Dome missile or the faster, lower-cost laser to do the job.' According to the agreement, the first operational system will be delivered to Israel by the end of next year. Like any defense system developed here, Israel’s adversaries will immediately seek ways to overcome it. Yet Steinitz remains unfazed by the challenge. 'There’s never 100 percent success, but while they think far ahead, so do we—ten steps ahead. This is just the beginning of the system. It’s clear that this breakthrough will bring additional applications and have a lasting impact on national defense in the future,' he concluded.

Reza Pahlavi reveals bold plan to end Iran's Islamic regime – is ...	Exclusive interview with former Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi Reza Pahlavi, the former crown prince of Iran, says the Islamic regime maintains its grip on power through indoctrination and proxy wars. In an exclusive interview with ILTV’s Emily Schrader, Pahlavi criticized Western policies that prioritize changing the regime’s behavior over advocating for its replacement. Instead, he supports a controlled implosion that would pave the way for a secular, democratic system. Pahlavi emphasized that Iranians are ready for change and that international support is crucial—but not through military intervention. What is his vision for the Iranian-Israeli relationship? Pahlavi envisions a strategic partnership between Israel and a free Iran, focused on mutual benefits and regional stability.

Is military or ‘civil’ force the key to regime change in Iran?	This is a war of narratives,' said Marty Youssefiani, who served as senior counselor to Iran’s crown prince. Over the weekend, Israel launched a powerful attack deep into Iran, demonstrating its capability to strike critical targets across the country at will. This show of force could pave the way for future strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities or energy infrastructure. Did Israel’s recent action weaken Iran’s leadership, or might it provoke retaliation? Two influential Iranian dissidents – Marty Youssefiani, a veteran campaign strategist who served as senior counselor to Iran’s crown prince, and Mohsen Sazegara, former Islamic Republic Deputy Prime Minister and founder of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards – discuss these questions on the latest episode of ILTV’s Insider. 'No regime change can ever be accomplished through military actions,' Youssefiani told Insider. 'What needs to be done is more investment in the Iranian people.' According to Youssefiani, much like Soviet Communism, Islamist governance in Iran is 'destined to fall' because it offers 'an epic but dark ideology.' He said that over the past 45 years, the people of Iran have witnessed the incompetence and corruption of living under a kleptocracy, and the world will see it too when the regime is no more. However, Youssefiani cautioned, this is not a war that can be won by missiles. 'This is a war of narratives that we can only win by winning the hearts and minds of the Iranian people, giving them the courage and confidence to stand up,' he said. However, there is hope that some military pressure may help convince the Iranian regime itself that it may be time for change. Sazegara noted that, for at least the last 25 years, Iranian military doctrine has centered on three pillars: asymmetric warfare or terrorist groups, missiles, and, as a deterrent, its nuclear project. Since Iranian proxy Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, and its other proxy, Hezbollah, began attacking Israel on October 8, Israel has managed to nearly dismantle these terrorist groups. 'The Iranian regime now has a big question,' Sazegara said. 'Now is the time for the leaders of Iran to think about the political consequences of such a defeat in its military doctrine.'

Lost Mayan city discovered in southern Mexico jungle	Archeologists in Mexico have discovered a huge, lost Mayan city, which they named Valeriana, hidden deep in the southern jungle of Campeche -- a sprawling, urban settlement, replete with architectural marvels and agricultural infrastructure.The discovery of what appears to have been a bustling urban landscape challenges the existing knowledge about the prevalence and density of ancient Mayan settlements. Valeriana was discovered by chance thanks to Lidar, or Light Detection and Ranging, a technology that uses lasers to map and analyze archaeological landscapes. The dataset used for the study came from approximately 122 square kilometers (47 square miles) of high-quality airborne Lidar data collected in 2013 as part of a forest monitoring project called Alianza and led by the Nature Conservancy in Mexico, to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1bfmgj11je	2024-10-29T15:43:48-07:00	
From Lebanon, a close look at Hezbollah’s strategy to attack Metu...	The village of Kila, adjacent to Metula in Israel’s Upper Galilee region, was a strategic hub in Hezbollah’s plan to infiltrate northern Israeli communities; IDF soldiers have since dismantled terror infrastructures there, including a tunnel meant to funnel 1,000 terrorists across the border; Our reporter is on the ground with troops in southern Lebanon After nearly a year of war, the once-thriving village of Metula now stands abandoned and battered. Most of its homes lie in ruins from repeated Hezbollah strikes. Through its walls, the extensive destruction and devastation of Hezbollah’s terror infrastructure in the neighboring Lebanese village of Kila are clearly visible, the result of intense operations by Israel’s 769th Brigade of the 91st Division. In recent weeks, following the government’s authorization for the IDF to advance into southern Lebanon, bulldozers have been working tirelessly within three kilometers of the border to dismantle weapons caches and demolish terror strongholds. As tunnels are unearthed, the scale of Hezbollah's terror network, meant to facilitate a full-scale invasion of northern Israel, becomes clearer. For months, both government and military leaders awaited a diplomatic resolution with Hezbollah to withdraw its forces. However, with Hezbollah’s persistent attacks on northern communities, Israel has had no choice but to act, leading to the evacuation of thousands of residents from villages along the Lebanese border. On Monday alone, Metula endured 12 more rocket barrages. 'Kila represents everything Hezbollah had planned,' says Colonel Avraham Marciano, commander of the 769th Brigade, after crossing into Lebanese territory. From this vantage point, Marciano explains, Hezbollah fighters once targeted the northern Galilee and even the Hula Valley. Standing at a lookout where, last January, Hezbollah terrorists launched an anti-tank missile that struck the Ayalon family’s living room in Kibbutz Kfar Yuval, killing Mira Ayalon and her son Barak as they ate lunch, Marciano recounts the discovery of an underground network for surveillance and intelligence gathering aimed at coordinating attacks on Israel. 'Today, we're settling the score and dismantling Hezbollah’s infrastructure,' Marciano declared. In recent days, IDF soldiers have left their mark on the Lebanese side of the border wall, painting over Hezbollah graffiti honoring the slain leader Hassan Nasrallah. These walls, initially erected as a defensive barrier to delay enemy advances until reinforcements could arrive, were a response to Hezbollah’s longstanding threat. Standing mere meters from Metula's orchards, near a Hezbollah-owned gas station, Marciano points to a tunnel that had been primed for attack but did not breach Israel’s border. 'Fifty meters from here, inside those ruins, we discovered a tunnel entrance where they planned their invasion route. It’s a complex hundreds of meters long. They intended to move beneath the main street of Kila, regroup, and launch an assault from there,' he says. Hezbollah had planned for over 1,000 fighters from Kila to spearhead the assault on the eastern Galilee. As part of ongoing operations, IDF forces are systematically neutralizing these threats, both above and below ground. David, one of the soldiers, participated in locating the tunnel. 'We found it still equipped with digging tools. Nearly every building we entered contained terror infrastructure: shafts, tunnels, weapons, ammunition, combat vests, and medical supplies,' he said. Marciano estimates that the brigade is about two-thirds of the way through its mission. 'I believe it will take just a few more weeks to completely eliminate Hezbollah’s invasion capabilities,' he says. However, the thunder of artillery and the wail of sirens in Metula signal that the task of restoring security to the region is far from over. The sight of Kila’s gas station reminds me of years spent observing locals living under Hezbollah’s influence on the other side of the border fence, where terrorists documented and harassed our movements. Villagers from Kila often threw stones or waved hostile gestures at us and shone laser pointers into Metula’s homes. Now, I find myself on the Lebanese side, amid the ruins of that very gas station. Dust covers the ground, and in the rubble, I spot a receipt dated September 2023 from the gas station. Apparently, a Ferrari owner had filled up with 80 liters of gas, bought five liters of motor oil, and paid $450 for it all, including a car wash. Returning to Israel, I meet David Azulai, head of the Metula Local Council, who surveys the view of Kila from across the border. Over 60% of homes in Metula have been destroyed by Hezbollah rockets, he says. Despite his admiration for the IDF’s work, he expresses concern that the ground operation might conclude prematurely. 'It’s impressive, yes, but I have to think ahead,' Azulai says. 'What will happen a month from now when the army isn’t here? We’ve heard promises like this too many times.' Azulai is deeply worried that political leaders, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, might halt the mission without fully restoring security to the region. He is firmly against a negotiated settlement to end the war. 'There’s no need for an agreement that binds us to the other side,' he argues. 'We need to set the conditions and make it clear that any future violation will lead to an even more decisive response.' Azulai hopes the shattered villages on the Lebanese side will remain so, as a stark reminder to Lebanon of the cost of provoking Israel. 'We need a clear buffer zone from here to the Litani River.' The IDF now faces the task of proving to Metula and its surrounding communities that they are safe. 'We’re only halfway through this journey. I’m far from feeling secure here,' says Riki Gino, a native of the village and the council’s CEO. Like her parents’ home, her house was destroyed by Hezbollah rockets. 'I need to know what comes next. We need visible assurance that it’s safe to live here again.'

Watch injured IDF soldiers as they are evacuated from war zones	Since the beginning of the conflict, over 1,800 wounded have been airlifted from Gaza and southern Lebanon by Unit 669 and Air Force helicopters; Watch their heroic efforts to safeguard the wounded as bullets are still flying The Unit 669 combat search and rescue extraction unit, medical teams and Air Force helicopters have whisked more than 1,800 wounded from war zones over the past year. On Tuesday evening, the IDF unveiled footage capturing the pulse-pounding moments of these helicopter rescues: 'The fourth is on the ramp, the doctor is coming,' the teams called out in one of the videos documenting the seconds that the helicopter was on the ground. Since the start of the conflict, the Medical Corps, Unit 669 teams, and rescue helicopters have been active in three combat zones: the Gaza Strip, southern Lebanon, and the West Bank. This week, the IDF has inaugurated a salute week for wounded and disabled IDF soldiers from the Gaza war, including many of those airlifted. Throughout the last year, Sikorsky CH-53 Yasur and Black Hawk helicopters have soared on over a thousand rescue sorties, leading to the evacuation and saving of more than 1,800 wounded. To date, about 200 of them have been airlifted from the northern sector, and approximately 1,600 from the southern sector, with additional wounded evacuated from various areas and incidents. Air Force helicopters undertake complex missions in compromised territories, supported by aircraft executing fire strikes to neutralize threats in the area. This is all to join forces with ground combat units and deliver advanced, life-saving care even as bullets rain down upon them. Senior caregivers work shoulder-to-shoulder with ground forces, ensuring initial medical response until evacuation arrives to guarantee the swiftest and most efficient life-saving treatment. 'Activities of the Medical Corps teams and the Air Force rescue teams have saved the lives of many combatants in all war arenas,' according to IDF spokesperson. On Tuesday, the Rehabilitation Division of the Ministry of Defense released its data: About 12,000 wounded IDF and security forces personnel have been received by the Rehabilitation Division since the beginning of the Gaza war, including 910 wounded evacuated to hospitals in the north since the start of the ground maneuver in Lebanon on October 1. Of these, 140 have already been received by the Rehabilitation Division, marking a 50% increase compared to security personnel wounded in the north last month who sought continued treatment. The remaining wounded were classified as lightly injured and returned to combat after receiving medical treatment. About 1,500 were injured twice in the war year. IDF's data stands at 5,184 wounded since the beginning of the war, but does not account for security personnel who are not soldiers, such as Shin Bet, police officers, emergency team members and those injured in routine events. The average annual cost of the treatment and economic support package for those wounded in war is estimated at about $40,000 per person.

US faces interceptor missile shortage amid Gaza war, global threa...	US sees missile stockpile depleting after over a year of aiding Israel in Gaza and the Red Sea; This raises concerns about US military readiness amid potential conflicts with Chinese aggression toward Taiwan and Russian aggression toward Ukraine The U.S. is facing a significant depletion of interceptor missiles after over a year of backing Israel in the Gaza conflict, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. This drain on U.S. military stockpiles is sparking anxiety in Washington over its readiness to respond to new potential flashpoints in Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific, where tensions with China, poised to invade Taiwan, are escalating. American officials informed the paper that concerns about a potential missile shortfall have intensified following Israel’s recent strike on Iran, which might provoke Iranian retaliation with another salvo of ballistic missiles. The shortage pertains mainly to guided missiles from the AEGIS system, deployed on some U.S. Navy destroyers. These ship-launched missiles, pivotal in protecting Israel over the past year against direct Iranian assaults in April and early October, are the SM-3 models, each costing $15 million. These interceptors are essential for U.S. efforts against drone and missile attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen targeting Israel and commercial vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Since the conflict’s onset on October 7 of last year, the U.S. has reportedly fired over 100 'Standard' missiles. The Pentagon has declined to disclose the exact number of interceptors in its arsenal to prevent this information from being leveraged by Iran and its proxies. 'Over the past year, the Department of Defense has adjusted its regional deployments to protect U.S. forces and aid in defending Israel, while considering U.S. readiness and stockpiles,' stated Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh. The Wall Street Journal highlights the challenges the U.S. faces in ramping up production of these missiles. The main hurdle is the reluctance of U.S. companies to invest heavily in new production lines without guarantees of sustained Pentagon purchases. Carlos Del Toro, a senior Pentagon official overseeing the Navy, noted some progress in producing two models of Standard missiles, but acknowledged significant obstacles remain in boosting production. 'The more sophisticated the missile, the harder it is to manufacture,' he explained. These missiles are pricey, with each costing several million dollars, and the U.S. often launches two interceptors per detected threat. According to Navy data, since the war began last year, the cost of interceptions by American ships against Iranian and Houthi missiles and drones has reached $1.8 billion. A U.S. congressional source expressed frustration, stating, 'These are very expensive munitions to shoot down subpar Houthi targets,' noting the significantly lower production costs for Iranian missiles and drones. 'Each interceptor takes months to replace at a very high cost.' U.S. sources also voiced concerns about the Pentagon's ability to replenish its stocks as quickly as they're depleted. Adding to this strain is the extensive military assistance the U.S. is channeling to Ukraine, embroiled in a protracted conflict with Russia for over two and a half years. 'The U.S. hasn't developed a defense industrial base designed for large-scale attrition wars in both Europe and the Middle East while maintaining readiness standards,' remarked Elias Youssef, a security researcher at the Stimson Center in Washington. 'These are prolonged conflicts not accounted for in U.S. security planning.' RTX, the company developing Standard missiles, can produce several hundred annually. However, not all are destined for the U.S., as the company serves 14 other countries. As part of the 'arms economy,' during the Iranian attack on October 1, the U.S. and the Israeli Defense Forces sometimes refrained from intercepting certain missiles if they weren't targeting sensitive areas. Deployment of the THAAD air defense system to Israel is reportedly linked to concerns about the Standard missile shortage, as THAAD uses different missiles. The Pentagon has also sent additional Patriot batteries to the Middle East, despite their own limitations, as they are also being dispatched to Ukraine. American sources and commentators have warned that the rapid depletion rate of missiles could leave the U.S. 'more exposed' to potential conflicts in the Pacific, where concerns over China's aggressive behavior are rising. 'We've depleted a year's worth of Standard missiles, meant to bolster our defenses against China,' Mark Montgomery, a former U.S. Navy admiral and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the newspaper. Ynet analyst Ron Ben-Yishai noted that the agreement with the U.S. to deploy the THAAD air defense system in Israel stemmed as much from American constraints as from Israeli needs. IDF requires additional American interceptors and launchers to counter potential massive Iranian missile barrages. In such scenarios, the more missiles launched in a single or dual salvo to overwhelm defense systems, the more interceptors, launchers, and radars are required. Israel has multiple layers of interceptor missile systems. At the top is the Arrow 3 system, targeting missiles hundreds of miles outside the atmosphere. Below it is Arrow 2, intercepting missiles near the atmospheric boundary, over 62 miles away. Further below is David's Sling, designed for defense against long-range missiles within the atmosphere. The lowest layer is Iron Dome, providing localized protection and intercepting short-range missiles within about 62 miles.

US lawmakers to Macron: 'Call to halt arms sales to Israel encour...	Eighteen U.S. lawmakers sent a scathing letter to French President Emmanuel Macron, in which they made it clear that they are deeply troubled by his call for an end to arms sales to Israel. They emphasized that Iran also threatens the security of the United States and France, and made it clear that Paris must support Israel's efforts to eradicate terrorism, protect its citizens and return the 101 hostages held in Gaza. The lawmakers urged Macron to reconsider his position, and focus on diplomatic efforts to strengthen security and democracy in the Middle East. 'Your call to halt arms shipments to Israel will further encourage Iran and its proxies to escalate their attacks against Israel,' they wrote.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk4uor0lyl	2024-10-29T13:51:54-07:00	
Fallen soldier's wife is expecting their first child	Master Sergeant (Res.) Yedidia Bloch, 31, from Mevo Horon, was seriously injured in a battle in southern Lebanon last week, but died of his wounds; His wife is eight months pregnant; 'I will tell your child about you so that he knows what a special and kind man his father was' IDF reservist Master Sergeant Yedidia Bloch, 31, who was seriously injured last week in a battle in southern Lebanon, died of his wounds in the hospital on Tuesday. Bloch, a resident of Mevo Horon, was expecting his first child and is survived by his wife Sapir, who is in the eighth month of her pregnancy; he also is survived by his parents and 7 siblings. Yedidia studied at Yeshivat Chitzim in Itamar in the northern West Bank, served in the Paratroopers Brigade and also fought in the 2014 Gaza War known as Operation Protective Edge. He continued his contribution to the IDF in the reserves, and in the current war he fought in Gaza and on the northern front as part of maneuvers in Lebanon. He was seriously injured last week in a battle in southern Lebanon, and after a long struggle in the Rambam Hospital he died Tuesday from his injuries. His family describes a man whose life was full of love for the country, generosity of heart and a genuine connection to every person he met. 'He was a devoted friend, with a big heart and always ready to help others, and a figure admired by all his nephews and nieces,' said a relative. His family donated his organs in order to save others. 'Someone asked me today what the name Yedidia means - and it is enough to see the light on your face to feel your friendship. Our beloved nephew and hero, the light of his eyes, the light of his heart,' Yedidia's aunt, Naomi, said in tribute to him. Yedidia's friend, Omri, wrote: 'Seven years ago when I was hiking the Israel Trail with my friend Assi, we arrived in the evening before sunset at Mevo Horon in the Latrun area. When we arrived we were so hungry and we met people told us that there was a pizzeria at the entrance of the community. Most of all I remember the reception of Yedidia when we met him there. He took our invitation, and he came to sit with us. I later found out that he served together with one of my best childhood friends and I knew at that moment that I had met a special person.' 'He was such a handsome man, blond, tall, with bright eyes. A light-hearted, funny guy and a smiling and happy person, and just as beautiful on the inside,' wrote Omri. 'I will never forget how when we came to pay him for the pizza, he simply said that it was on him. This kindness moved me so much at that moment. I thought about what a privilege it is to meet such kind people in a way that simply gives from the heart. Yedidia Bloch, you are the beautiful Israeli. This is how I will remember you as a man and a dear friend, a man of giving, laughter and true love. I will tell your child about you as soon as he grows up - so that he knows what a special and kind man his father was.' Nissan, another friend of Yedidia, wrote: 'In October 2017, I started studying, and on the first day I saw that I and another handsome blond guy with the only knitted kippa wearers. We immediately connected and were best friends for our college years. Always smiling, never angry and looking only to help and donate. For a whole year I followed every report and names of fallen soldiers in anxiety. For five days, we hoped but unfortunately sometimes God says no. You are now close to the throne of honor. Rest in peace friend.' Yisrael Gantz, head of the Binyamin Regional Council, where Mevo Horon is located, eulogized the fallen soldier. 'All these days we prayed for Yedidia. He went into battle with self-sacrifice and lived a noble life, and thus he fought and died for the sake of the people of Israel and complete victory. Thanks to him, the people of Israel will overcome and win.' Earlier on Tuesday, the names of four soldiers killed in battle in Jabaliya in northern Gaza were announced: Captain Yehonatan (Joni) Keren, 22; Staff Sergeant Nisim Meytal,20; Staff Sergeant Aviv Gilboa, 21; and Staff Sergeant Naor Haimov; 22.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkotpa0ejx	2024-10-29T13:43:29-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/29/yk14132071/yk14132071_1_67_710_400_0_small.jpg

From school teacher to international terrorist - Meet Hezbollah's...	He served as the Iranian proxy's number 2 for 34 years, and now Naim Qassem gets his 15 minutes of fame as head of the terror group, officially replacing Nasrallah; He is a Hezbollah co-founder and is also a former high school teacher Hezbollah officially named Naim Qassem as its new secretary-general on Tuesday. For 34 years, Qassem served as the deputy under the recently assassinated Hassan Nasrallah and his predecessor Abbas al-Musawi. Now, he steps into the limelight and into the thick of the conflict. Qassem wasn't the first pick to succeed Nasrallah. However, following the assassination of Hashem Safieddine, who was set to be the next leader, Qassem emerged as the natural choice among the surviving top brass. Since the assassination of Nasrallah in late September, Qassem has delivered three speeches for Hezbollah. His initial speech seemed unpolished; he appeared nervous, sweated a lot, and the background hinted he was in hiding. His third speech showed improvement, possibly due to feedback on his earlier appearances. In his latest address, Qassem declared: 'We are no longer in the phase of 'support' for Gaza but in direct confrontation with an Israeli war against us.' He claimed this shift began with the operation to blow up pagers in Lebanon. He insisted the organization is still operational and promised a new Secretary-General would be appointed soon. It's unclear if he knew then that he would assume the role. Naim Qassem has been a key figure in the terrorist organization for decades. Born in 1953 in the Al-Basta al-Tahta area of Beirut, his family hails from the Shiite-majority village of Qafar Fila in southern Lebanon. According to Asharq Al-Awsat, he is married with six children. Qassem has held the position of Deputy Secretary-General since 1991, during the tenure of former Secretary-General Abbas al-Moussawi, who was assassinated in 1992 by Israel. He remained in the role after Nasrallah's appointment. He began his political career with the Shiite Amal Movement in Lebanon, founded in 1974, and left in 1979 following the Iranian Revolution. Qassem participated in the meetings that led to Hezbollah's formation in 1982 and became one of its prominent spokesmen. He also served as the general coordinator for Hezbollah's parliamentary election campaigns since the organization first ran in 1992. Qassem studied under Shiite scholars in Lebanon while pursuing academic studies at the University of Lebanon in 1971, where he earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry. He completed his master's degree in chemistry in 1977. Subsequently, Qassem worked as a high school teacher for six years. He helped establish the 'Lebanese Union of Muslim Students' during his university years to spread Islamic ideas in the 1970s. Over the years, he also served on Hezbollah's Shura Council. In 2005, he authored a book on Hezbollah's history, offering a rare glimpse into the organization. About six years ago, the U.S. government designated Qassem as an 'international terrorist,' subjecting him to economic and business sanctions. Earlier this month, a report from the Emirates, based on an Iranian source, claimed Qassem fled to Iran at the start of October, fearing assassination by Israel. According to the unverified report, he has been in Tehran since October 5. It was also alleged that he left Lebanon on an Iranian plane, accompanied by Abbas Araghchi, Tehran's foreign minister, first to Syria and then to Iran. The source claimed Qassem's last two speeches were actually delivered from Khamenei's homeland. Report: Shura Council made the decision - not Tehran The London-based Arabic newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat published an article about Hezbollah's Shura Council, suggesting that if it managed to convene, it indicates – according to sources close to the organization – that the council has regrouped after significant setbacks and can now hold meetings of senior Hezbollah leaders despite security risks. It was also suggested that if the council convened, it shows Tehran did not take over Hezbollah's political and military leadership after Nasrallah's assassination, contrary to rumors. The paper noted that Hezbollah's organizational structure is divided into three main frameworks: The first—the Secretary-General, who holds extensive powers The second—the Shura Council, whose members head four organizational councils: the Jihad Council, the Legal Council, the Governmental and Parliamentary Work Council, and the Political Council The third—the Executive Council (formerly led by Safi al-Din before his assassination). The Executive Council is Hezbollah's core, from which most organizational units branch out. Among the councils, the Shura Council is the most important. The Shura Council includes seven members: the Secretary-General of Hezbollah, who is also the Chairman of the Shura Council, the Deputy Secretary-General of Hezbollah—Head of the Legal Council Mohammad Yazbak, Head of the Political Council Ibrahim Amin al-Sayyid, Head of the Executive Council—recently assassinated—Hashem Saffiedine, the political assistant to the Hezbollah Secretary-General Hussein Khalil, the head of the parliamentary branch and leader of Hezbollah's party in the Lebanese parliament, 'Loyalty to the Resistance Bloc' (Hezbollah's political arm), Mohammad Raad. With Qassem's appointment, two positions remain vacant in the Shura Council: the Deputy Secretary-General and Chairman of the Executive Council. Qassem Kassir, a political researcher interviewed by the newspaper, said a Deputy Secretary-General has not yet been appointed and that it is a crucial appointment, 'a message from within and outside that Hezbollah is active and monitoring affairs.' Other sources interviewed did not rule out that even if a deputy to the new Secretary-General is appointed, his identity will not be disclosed, as he would become a strategic target for Israel, similar to Naim Qassem, who wants Hezbollah to remain leaderless.

GOP works to turn out pro-Trump Jewish voters in swing states to ...	The door-to-door outreach to Jewish voters with a history of backing Republicans is part of a new effort the Republican Jewish Coalition is undertaking this year in five presidential battleground states in hopes of boosting Trump Rachel Weinberg calls herself a religious Jew first, then a proud American. She said she had only one choice for president: Donald Trump. 'I don’t like everything he says,' the 72-year-old retired preschool teacher from Michigan said after volunteer canvassers for the Republican Jewish Coalition knocked on her door Sunday. 'But I vote for Israel. It is our life. I support Israel. Trump supports Israel with his mouth and his actions.' Weinberg’s home in West Bloomfield, in vote-rich Oakland County, was among more than 20 that the Republican Jewish Coalition was visiting that morning. She has voted for Trump in previous elections as well. The door-to-door outreach to Jewish voters with a history of backing Republicans is part of a new effort the group is undertaking this year in five presidential battleground states in hopes of boosting Trump over Democrat Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 election. Although surveys show that Jews vote decidedly Democratic, the Republican Jewish Coalition is hoping that the door-knocking will peel off enough votes to make a difference in an election year when the war between Israel and Hamas has stoked debate and provoked division. About 7 in 10 Jewish voters nationally backed Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, while about 3 in 10 backed Trump that year, according to AP VoteCast, a sweeping electorate survey. A Pew Research Center poll released last month found that about two-thirds of Jewish voters back Harris. Biden carried Michigan in 2020 by fewer than 155,000 votes out of roughly 5.5 million cast. Although Jewish voters account for only 2% of the state’s voters, the 15,000 new Jewish Republican voters the coalition has identified since the 2020 election — out of roughly 120,000 Jewish voters in the state — could make an impact in what is shaping up to be a very close race, said Sam Markstein, an RJC spokesperson. The Republican Jewish Coalition’s targeting is very specific in Michigan, as it is in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Here, its work is centered in Oakland County, the state’s second most populous county, with 1.3 million people just northwest of Detroit. It focuses on the upper-middle-class suburbs of Farmington Hills, Oak Park, Southfield, and West Bloomfield — the township with the state’s largest Jewish population, where Israeli flags hang in some front windows. Biden defeated Trump in 2020, 66% to 33%, in the West Bloomfield Township precinct where 82-year-old David Cuttner and 22-year-old Noam Nedivi were canvassing for the coalition on Sunday. The margin was not far off the national trend. The coalition’s robust effort is aimed at chipping away at Democrats’ advantages in this voting bloc. 'This includes direct mail, social, and digital, all hyper-targeted to the Jewish community. And it’s going to be a full thrust, the largest investment ever to turn out Jewish voters for Republicans,' Markstein said. The Republican Jewish Coalition has purchased $15 million in advertising in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. But it’s the $5 million it has committed to door-to-door outreach that is new for this election, chiefly its investment in voter data aimed at more efficiently identifying potential Trump supporters. Halie Soifer, the CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said in a statement that Jewish voters are a key part of a winning Democratic coalition. 'Kamala Harris shares the views and values of the majority of American Jews, while Donald Trump threatens and denigrates us, trafficks in antisemitic rhetoric, aligns with dangerous extremists, and aspires to be a dictator on day one,' Soifer said. Tensions have been high since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people in Israel and took 250 people hostage. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in the subsequent fighting, according to Gaza health officials. Republicans were more likely than Democrats to be supportive of Israel, while Democrats were more likely to be critical, a survey by the Pearson Institute and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found in September. The fighting has intensified the focus on the relationship between Israel and the U.S., which has provided at least $17.9 billion in military aid since the war began. Many Jews say rising acts of antisemitism in the United States and anti-Israel protests in cities and college campuses have made them feel unsafe. Nedivi, who was canvassing Sunday, said he had been a victim of antisemitism at the Michigan college he attends. Zeke Aharonov had an alternative message for his fellow observant Jews after standing in a line of more than 200 people to cast his early vote at the West Bloomfield library Sunday. 'As Jews, we must be attentive to fascism and to fight it,' the 26-year-old cybersecurity tech said as he left the library. 'And our way of fighting fascism is to vote against Donald Trump.'

Pentagon reassigns worker who leaked Iran attack plans to role wi...	Ariane Tabatabai to be moved to a position overseeing education and training within the Defense Secretary’s office; Pentagon still denies she was the leaker The Pentagon has reassigned Ariane Tabatabai, whose name has been linked to a leak of intelligence documents regarding Israel’s strike plans on Iran, to a role with significantly reduced access to intelligence and classified military plans. Although the Pentagon denied Tabatabai’s involvement in the leak, given her previous connections to Iran, it decided to move her to a position overseeing education and training within the Defense Secretary’s office. Tabatabai served as the head of the Office of Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict, a role that gave her unique access to high-level classified intelligence and information on nearly all U.S. covert operations. Her new position, by contrast, provides significantly limited access to intelligence and classified operational plans. Independent of the leak controversy, some Republican members of Congress have spent the past year pushing to revoke Tabatabai’s security clearance over reported ties to Tehran. Sky News Arabic reported a week ago that Tabatabai was the source of the leaked documents, which covered preparations for an Israeli strike on Iran and were published prior to the operation’s launch. Pentagon spokesperson Patrick Ryder denied these reports, stating that the Pentagon is investigating the matter and coordinating with Israel. To date, the source of the leak has not been identified.

IDF chief: If Iran attacks we will hit back with capabilities tha...	IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi warned Iran on Tuesday to stand down from any retaliation for Israel's airstrikes near Tehran last week, which followed an Iranian missile barrage on Oct. 1. 'If Iran makes the mistake of launching another missile barrage at Israel, we will once again know how to reach Iran, with capabilities that we did not even use this time,' Halevi told air and ground crews who took part in the strike on Iran against missile factories and other sites last Saturday.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r12a4oaeyl	2024-10-29T10:11:07-07:00	
Migrant workers in Lebanon left stranded as war with Israel conti...	Caregiving remains a lifeline for Middle Eastern households, but these migrant workers battle loneliness, exploitation and insufficient protections amid regional crises; Home care in Israel is also heavily dependent on foreign workers In Lebanon, a country facing widespread destruction and displacement caused by the conflict with Israel, migrant caregivers are among the most vulnerable populations. Bram Frouws, director of the Mixed Migration Centre, highlighted the significant vulnerability of migrant care workers in Lebanon amid the ongoing conflict. 'Since the escalation of the war began, many employers fled the country or fled north, and left their migrant workers without pay, shelter, or food, and many were left stranded,' he said. 'Many migrant workers have now been left sleeping on the streets, with no access to basic necessities or humanitarian aid. Shelters often only permit entry for Lebanese citizens.' The immigration status of migrant workers in Lebanon is tied to the individual employer, Frouws explained, which opens up Lebanon’s 175,000 migrant workers to exploitation and abuse even during peacetime. Now, that vulnerability has been amplified. Many of these migrant workers don’t have access to their passports, which are held by the employers. 'Lacking financial resources and documentation really makes it near impossible to escape,' Frouws said. Language barriers, restricted mobility, limited social networks, and discrimination all exacerbate the situation. Frouws expressed concern that migrant workers are being left out of government and humanitarian responses to the humanitarian crisis in Lebanon. 'This is often the case with migrants who are caught up in a sudden conflict,' he said. October 29 marks the International Day of Care and Support, a day dedicated to recognizing and raising awareness about the vital role of caregivers. The UN established the day to spark conversations about the importance of care work, both paid and unpaid, which serves as the backbone of society and ensures that individuals and systems can thrive and function smoothly. Those conversations have a special significance in the Middle East, which relies heavily on migrant domestic workers to provide care to elderly and disabled individuals. Despite the critical contributions of migrant caregivers in Middle Eastern households, most still face unfair and unsafe working conditions, including long hours, minimal rest time, and vulnerability to exploitation. Legal protections and social safeguards for these caregivers are often inadequate or poorly enforced. Home care in Israel is also heavily dependent on foreign workers. As of the end of 2023, more than 75,000 foreign caregivers were working in Israel, according to data from the Population and Immigration Authority. The caregivers come from a diverse range of countries, with the largest groups hailing from the Philippines (26,673), India (19,924), and Uzbekistan (12,335). Many also come from Moldova, Sri Lanka, and Ukraine. About 60,000 of the workers have documents to work in Israel, and the other 15,000 do not. Meytal Russo, deputy executive director of Kav LaOved, an Israeli nonprofit dedicated to securing equal labor rights for all workers, explains that foreign caregivers in Israel face a complex and challenging bureaucracy. 'About 95% to 99% are coming with legal documentation, allowing them to stay here for five years and three months,' Russo said. That period applies to all foreign workers, but caregivers can apply to extend their stay to continue to serve the same elderly or disabled patient they had been caring for. 'There is a lot of bureaucracy involved in that,' Russo said. 'Caregivers are required to be available 24 hours a day, six days a week and are obliged to stay at the patient’s home,' she said. These workers receive only minimum wage without overtime pay and are excluded from the law mandating breaks. 'This exclusion stems from a Supreme Court decision that ruled it is impossible to quantify a caregiver’s rest time due to the nature of their work,' Russo explained. She also raised concerns about the high brokerage fees paid by caregivers to come to Israel. 'Many workers pay between $7,000 and $30,000 in fees, creating significant financial burdens,' she said, noting that most workers still rely on private work placement agencies despite government attempts to regulate the process through bilateral agreements. 'The situation remains business to business, with undocumented payments being made to private agencies abroad and sometimes to agencies within Israel.' The vast majority of migrant caregivers in Israel are women, and these female caregivers face substantial risks of sexual harassment and assault, Russo said. Often the perpetrator is a patient with dementia or one of the patient’s family members. 'The vulnerability of a migrant woman working in a home is very high,' Russo explained. Physical demands of the work also add to caregivers’ challenges, with many experiencing orthopedic issues due to heavy lifting and inadequate professional support. Living in a patient’s private home and developing a relationship with the patient and the family can also be challenging. 'There is a wide spectrum, with some very good relationships and others that are quite bad,' Russo said. All these challenges can lead migrant caregivers to experience burnout. 'If you are burnt out in a regular job, you can find another one,' Russo said. 'But here, you’re tied to the same employer, which creates a dangerous situation for both the caregiver and the patient.' Migrant caregiving is especially widespread in Gulf Cooperation Council countries. According to Migrant-Rights.org, a GCC-based advocacy organization focused on advancing migrant workers’ rights, over 90% of Kuwaiti households employ migrant domestic workers. The 620,000 migrant domestic workers in Kuwait represent more than 22% of the country’s total workforce. These workers often face significant disparities in wages and working conditions. In Bahrain, migrant domestic workers account for 10% of the entire workforce and 37% of the female workforce. Migrant workers dominate the domestic work sector in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, making up 95% of all domestic workers and personal assistants. About 20% of all foreign workers in the UAE perform domestic work. Around 96% of Emirati families hire domestic workers to care for their children. These 750,000 or so workers perform an estimated 80% of parental duties, outnumbering family members in 22% of Emirati households. Domestic workers constitute about 20% of the total expatriate workforce in the country. Domestic workers in Saudi Arabia face particularly long hours, averaging 63.7 hours per week – the second-highest rate globally. Similarly, in Qatar, domestic workers average 60 hours of work per week. Wages remain a significant issue for migrant domestic workers. In Qatar, domestic workers earn less than 30% of the average national wage, while in Kuwait, their earnings are under 30% of the average national wage. The minimum monthly wage for domestic workers in Kuwait is $147, but enforcement mechanisms to guarantee this payment are insufficient. In Saudi Arabia, domestic workers from Sri Lanka earn just 20% of the private sector’s minimum wage, receiving approximately $80-$100 per month. Santhosh, a 35-year-old caregiver from India, came to Israel last year. 'My patient is in very good condition and very supportive to me, so I am happy to be here,' he said. But he quietly added that he found the relentless nature of the job and the distance from his family to be challenging. 'It’s very lonely,' Santhosh said. 'Facebook and WhatsApp help, but I miss my family. I feel a constant loneliness.' Despite the difficulty, he expressed a sense of determination. 'I want to continue working, and I’m grateful for the opportunity,' he said. For a caregiver from the Philippines who asked to remain anonymous, the hardest part of the job is the emotional isolation. 'I was prepared for hard work, and I do it to support my family,' she said. 'But here, I became very lonely.' 'I feel like my whole life is online, and the rest is just me working. Nothing else,' she said. -This article is written by Veronica Neifakh and reprinted with permission from The Media Line Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s1119gq0ljg	2024-10-29T10:06:15-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/29/SyLNXiRxye/SyLNXiRxye_0_0_3000_2065_0_small.jpg
Sirens sounded in Metula, northern Israel		https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b17sr90ekx	2024-10-29T09:41:42-07:00	
Defense Ministry reports 12,000 soldiers injured since start of G...	Ministry's Rehabilitation Division reports at least 900 of injuries took place in Lebanon since start of IDF ground operation in region; Male reservist soldiers highest injured demographic Approximately 12,000 IDF soldiers and security force personnel wounded since the start of the Gaza war have been admitted to the Defense Ministry’s Rehabilitation Division, including 910 injured who were evacuated to hospitals in the north since the beginning of the military’s ground operation in Lebanon on October 1. Of these, 140 have already been registered to the Rehabilitation Division, marking a 50% increase compared to security forces personnel wounded in the north last month who requested continued treatment. The remaining wounded, classified as lightly injured, returned to service after receiving medical care. Around 1,500 individuals have been wounded twice over the course of the year-long ongoing war. Notably, IDF statistics record 5,184 wounded since the start of the war, though they don’t account for non-military security personnel, such as Shin Bet operatives, police officers, alert squad members and those wounded in routine incidents. The average annual cost for treatment and financial support for a wounded soldier is estimated at approximately 150,000 shekels ($40,000) per person. The Rehabilitation Division's budget, which stood at 5.4 billion shekels (about $1.5 billion) before October 7, 2023, has increased to 7.3 billion shekels (about $2 billion). However, division head Limor Luria warns that further budget increases are needed to provide adequate care. 'We need budgetary support,' she said on Tuesday. 'We've reached out to the Finance Ministry to help us address the high number of casualties, which is expected to grow in the coming years, and provide them with optimal care.' Men comprise 93% of the wounded; the percentage of women in the division remains at 7%, but the nature of injuries has evolved and the number of female combatants has increased. Of the wounded, 66% are reservists, 51% are aged 18-30 and approximately 8,500 (66%) face physical injuries. Among them, 14% are classified with moderate-to-severe injuries, including 377 with head injuries, of which 23 required skull reconstruction using a 3D printer. Eye injuries impacted 308 individuals, with 12 losing vision and needing prosthetics. Additionally, 104 suffered spinal injuries and roughly 60 had limb amputations requiring advanced prosthetic adaptations, five of whom required fittings abroad. A total of 5,200 (43%) developed psychological response conditions including anxiety, depression, adjustment issues and PTSD. The division anticipates the number will rise. 'It’s still early to gauge the extent of psychological injuries as these effects solidify over time,' Luria added. Each month, the division admits around 1,000 new wounded personnel, alongside roughly 500 additional recognition requests for past incidents. The number of individuals treated by the division has grown by 20% in a year, reaching approximately 74,000. The Rehabilitation Division estimates there will be around 100,000 disabled IDF veterans by 2030, 50% of whom will be dealing with psychological trauma. As of October 6, 2023, elderly disabled IDF veterans constituted about 50% of all disabled veterans. This dynamic has shifted considerably with the intake of younger wounded personnel, prompting the division to tailor support for educational reintegration, vocational training and occupational rehabilitation for the wounded. The Rehabilitation Division said it is continuing its 'rehabilitation before bureaucracy' policy, providing immediate medical and psychological care for all injured personnel while postponing medical evaluations for a year. Currently, 22,000 individuals dealing with psychological challenges are receiving support through various frameworks: 500 therapists have been recruited and 10 rehabilitation facilities have been established across the country. These offer body-mind workshops, discussion circles and varied agricultural activities. In the future, family-oriented activities will also be held at these locations. Additionally, PPS (primary psychological support) mobile units have been set up to provide immediate mental health aid and three care homes have been opened specifically for war-wounded personnel. IDF Disabled Veterans Organization Chairman Idan Kliman commented on the latest data, saying: 'At this time, when the State of Israel has a moral and ethical debt to wounded IDF soldiers who have sacrificed, and continue to sacrifice, their bodies and minds for the country’s survival, the Israeli government has decided to harm these soldiers in the 2025 Economic Arrangements Law by freezing their compensation for injuries sustained in service.' 'This decision continues the government’s total disregard for wounded IDF veterans, severely violating agreements with the IDF Disabled Veterans Organization and government resolutions, directly hindering the rehabilitation of our heroes and undermining national resilience,' he added.

Erdogan says Turkey aims to have 'Steel Dome' air defense system	President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that Turkey aimed to have its own 'Steel Dome' multi-layered air defense system soon, adding that Ankara would also increase its long-range missile capabilities. NATO member Turkey has in recent years significantly reduced its dependence on external suppliers of defense equipment. It has become a leading manufacturer of armed drones for the global market and produces much of its own defense needs at home. Speaking at a ceremony in Ankara to inaugurate the home-made Gokbey helicopter for use by the gendarmerie at the headquarters of the Turkish Aerospace Industries (TUSAS), which was targeted by a deadly Kurdish militant attack last week, Erdogan likened the 'Steel Dome' to Israel's famed Iron Dome. 'It is understood much better now how vitally important our multi-layered air defense systems are for our security. If they (Israel) have an 'Iron Dome', we will have a 'Steel Dome'. We won't look at them and say 'why don't we have this',' Erdogan said, without giving a specific timeline. 'We will increase our long-range missile capabilities during this period too,' he added, saying Turkey would 'not rest' until it achieved full independence in the defense industry.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkp2wkagke	2024-10-29T07:41:38-07:00

New satellite images from Iran: Attack damaged Iran Revolutionary...	New footage following Israel's retaliatory strike on Iranian territory reveals damage to the Shahroud base, where the IRGC launches satellites into space; Iran is 'still assessing the damage' Israel’s attack on Iran over the weekend likely damaged a base run by the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard that builds ballistic missiles and launches rockets as part of its own space program, satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press on Tuesday showed. The damage at the base in Shahroud raises new questions about the early Saturday attack, which took place in an area previously unacknowledged by Tehran and which involved the IRGC, a powerful force within Iran’s theocracy that so far has remained silent about any possible damage it suffered from the retaliatory strike. Iran only has identified Israeli attacks as taking place in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces — not in rural Semnan province where the base is located. It also potentially further restrains the Guard’s ability to manufacture the solid-fuel ballistic missiles it needs to stockpile as a deterrent against Israel. Tehran long has relied on that arsenal as it cannot purchase the advanced Western weapons that Israel and Tehran’s Gulf Arab neighbors have armed themselves with over the years, particularly from the United States. Satellite photos earlier analyzed by the AP of two military bases near Tehran also targeted by Israel show that sites there that Iran uses in its ballistic missile manufacturing have been destroyed, further squeezing its program. 'We don’t know if Iranian production has been crippled as some people are saying or just damaged,' said Fabian Hinz, a missile expert and research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies who studies Iran. 'We’ve seen enough imagery to show there’s an impact.' Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The IDF declined to answer questions from the AP, but sent a previous statement acknowledging it targeted 'missile manufacturing facilities' in the attack. Images show major building at Shahroud base destroyed High-resolution satellite images from Planet Labs PBC taken for and analyzed by the AP showed the damage at the Guard’s Shahroud Space Center in Semnan, some 370 kilometers (230 miles) northeast of the Iranian capital, Tehran. Semnan also hosts the Imam Khomeini Space Center, which is used by Iran’s civilian space program. The images showed a central, major building at the Shahroud Space Center had been destroyed, the shadow of its still-standing frame seen in the image taken Tuesday morning. Vehicles could be seen gathered around the site, likely from officials inspecting the damage, with more cars than normal parked at the site’s main gate nearby. Three small buildings just to the south of the main structure also appeared to be damaged. Iran has been constructing new buildings at the base in recent months. Another hangar to the northeast of the main building also appeared to have been damaged. Iran has not acknowledged any attack at Shahroud. However, given the damage done to multiple structures, it suggested the Israeli attack included pinpoint strikes on the base. Low-resolution images since the attack showed signs of damage at the site not seen before the assault — further pointing to Israeli missile strikes as being the culprit. 'We can’t 100% exclude the possibility it’s something else, but it’s almost certain this building got damaged because of an Israeli attack,' Hinz said. Given that the large building had been surrounded by earthen berms, that suggests it handled high explosives, said Hinz, who long has studied the site. That central site likely deals with solid propellant mixing and casting operations, he added. Large boxes next to the building likely are missile motor crates as well, Hinz said. Their sizes suggest they could be used for Iran’s Kheibar Shekan ballistic missile and the Fattah 1, a missile that Iran has claimed is able to reach Mach 15 — which is 15 times the speed of sound. Both have been used in Iran’s attacks on Israel during the Israel-Hamas war and the later ground invasion of Lebanon. The strike at Shahroud, coupled with others across the country, likely have put more pressure on Iran’s theocracy, particularly as it assesses the damage to its main weapon arsenal and tries to downplay the attack. 'Due to preparedness and vigilance of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s armed forces, and timely reaction by the country’s air defense, limited damage was caused to some of the points hit,' Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi claimed in a meeting with foreign diplomats Tuesday in Tehran. 'Necessary measures were taken immediately to restore the damaged equipment to operational state.' US worries Guard’s space program a cover for missile research A short distance from the destroyed buildings sits a concrete launch pad used by the Guard, which has conducted a series of successful missions putting satellites into space using mobile launchers. The Guard, which answers only to 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, revealed its secret space program back in 2020. The U.S. intelligence community’s 2024 worldwide threat assessment said Iran’s continued development of satellite launch vehicles 'would shorten the timeline to produce' an intercontinental ballistic missile because it uses similar technology. Intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran is now producing uranium close to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran has enough enriched uranium for 'several' nuclear weapons, if it chooses to produce them, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency repeatedly has warned. Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003. Parchin, one of the two military bases near Tehran targeted by Israel, saw a building linked to that program destroyed. 'Like with Iran’s nuclear program, you don’t build the system itself, you build all the technology under cover of a civilian program,' Hinz said. Then, Iran could make the decision to pursue the weapon — or use its knowledge as a bargaining chip with the West over international sanctions. But for now, the satellite photos suggest Iran is still trying to assess the aftermath of Israel’s attack. 'The picture that is emerging is one of significant damage to Iranian air defenses as well as missile launch facilities, both of which would be intended to show the Iranians that they are vulnerable to further strikes if they attempt retaliation,' an analysis published Monday by two experts at Britain’s Royal United Services Institute said.

Within walking distance: Six bereaved families mourn fallen soldi...	Grieving Jerusalem families, friends and comrades gather at the capital to mourn the losses of fallen soldiers from the city; these are their stories The homes of families mourning their loved ones killed in the war are easy to find. Buildings draped in Israeli flags with condolence notices at the entrance have become part of the landscape. Dozens of bereaved families across the country are sitting shiva, a number of them in Jerusalem are located just minutes from each other. Captain (res.) Rabbi Avraham Yosef Goldberg A mourning tent has been set up near the home of Rabbi Avraham Yosef Goldberg, who was killed in a battle in southern Lebanon. Rows of Israeli flags guide visitors there, paying respects to the deceased and marking the way. As in his life, Captain (res.) Goldberg's mourning tent is filled with a diverse crowd of people. High school students alongside older adults and female soldiers mingling among ultra-Orthodox men, all share in the painful space. One by one, the mourners shared reflections of him: a devoted educator, a gifted musician, a soldier who never missed a day of service and a cantor during the Jewish High Holidays. He was a kollel head, rabbi, teacher, father — a world. 'It’s just so him,' said his widow, Rachel, when visitors from Kibbutz Ginosar described his usual leading of Yom Kippur prayers in their kibbutz, sharing a voice message he sent with a Rosh Hashanah blessing after being unable to join them in the past holiday. 'That’s exactly who he was — he cared about everyone with all his heart.' Rabbi Goldberg left his eight children behind. 'Our father lived a life for the nation,' said his eldest son, Yehuda. 'His life was dedicated to the people of Israel, without ever considering what would be most comfortable for him. Wherever Israel needed him, that’s where he wanted to be.' Rabbi Goldberg, who fell at 43, continued serving in the reserves as both a soldier and military rabbi even after he was exempt. His absence was already felt over the past year — in his classroom, in the projects he led and most deeply, at home. 'This year prepared us to say goodbye,' Yehuda added. 'He wasn’t home often, both with us and with his students. Both God and our father made us ready for it an advance.' Warrant Officer (res.) Shmuel Harari A short walk away, another building bears the same painful front. The parents, widow and three children of Warrant Officer (res.) Shmuel Harari, who fell in Lebanon, are gathered at the widow Anna’s parents' home. Seventeen years ago, Shmuel made aliyah, enlisted in the IDF, started a family and stayed on for reserve duty. His parents and siblings have flown in from the United States to sit shiva with his wife, who lives in Safed and chose to mourn at her parents’ home in Jerusalem. 'He made aliyah at 17,' his brother Aivy said. 'He finished high school and immediately came to spend a year in a yeshiva in Israel, after which he enlisted and stayed here. Our parents really wanted him to stay in the United States; our dad wanted him to go to university and earn a decent living, but it wasn’t even a consideration for him.' Aivy shared that Shmuel 'was very eager to come to Israel. For years before he finished high school, he said he would make aliyah. He was very Zionistic despite our parents’ worry. He got married and lived in Safed because that’s where his wife studied medicine and she relocated to Jerusalem during the height of the war while he spent most of the year in reserve duty.' Last summer, the family gathered for what would become an unexpected farewell meeting. 'He finished his reserve duty in the summer,' Aivy recounted. 'We had a great time together; we were so happy to meet up. He delayed his return to work for a whole month to be with us and then, after the fighting began in Lebanon, he was called back. That’s how it ended.' Sergeant Hillel Ovadia Not far from there, a large mourning tent is also being set up beneath the family home of Sergeant Hillel Ovadia, filled with many mourners. Hillel, 22, who fell in Jabalia, was an Armored Corps soldier and a trainee in the tank commander course in the 196th Battalion, having graduated from the pre-military yeshiva in Brukhin. One by one, friends from his yeshiva and the military entered the tent to share stories about the young man who was always cheerful. In the yeshiva, he would deeply engage in study for hours; when it rained, he would lead joyous dances outside and would set the tone for serious learning after returning to the study hall. Sergeant Major (Res.) Gilad Elmalich Far from there, in northern Jerusalem, the family of Sergeant Major (Res.) Gilad Elmalich, sits shiva. His parents, brother, widow and children gather to mourn. 'Gilad wasn’t home much this year,' said his widow, Shir. 'He knew he would be there whenever the Israeli people needed him. He never thought of backing down or asking not to participate in any of the missions.' 'It was about his connection to the Torah and the values he believed in so strongly,' she added. 'Everyone felt he was their best friend. He felt a timeless connection to generations of the Jewish people, and always acted from that strength. He leaped into every mission. He volunteered with Holocaust survivors, always helping and all of it stemmed from his connection to the Torah.' First Sergeant Yaakov Hillel In Jerusalem’s Neve Yaakov neighborhood, among knitted kippahs and notices against conscription to the IDF on bulletin boards, shopping centers and yeshivas, sits the shiva for First Sergeant Yaakov Hillel, 21, a Golani Brigade soldier who fell in Lebanon. Yaakov came from a Haredi family and there is a notable presence of yeshiva students and rabbis at the shiva at his home, along with his friends and military commanders. His father, Rabbi Chaim Hillel, a well-known educator in the Haredi community, sees no contradiction between his son’s life path and that of his other siblings and family members. 'It wasn’t a different path,' Rabbi Hillel says. 'It was his own way. Yaakov was the third child among ten sons and daughters, all learning in Haredi frameworks. His brothers study in yeshiva,' the father said, 'and he wanted to enlist. He wasn’t raised to do so, but that was his choice. He was a man of truth first and foremost; he paved a genuine path and when he saw what was right for him, he wasn’t concerned about what others would say. That turly characterized him.' 'One of the things that gives us the greatest comfort is that we always walked alongside him,' the father continued. 'This was a path he forged with difficulty and effort, due to the different background he had compared to most soldiers. He was filled with a sense of mission and we were always by his side.' Captain (res.) Alon Safrai The family of Captain (res.) Alon Safrai, a Jerusalem resident, is also sitting shiva nearby. Safrai, 28, was a medical student — and wasn’t obligated to serve in the reserves. 'Alon was a student for whom everything came so easily; he was a star, and everything just flowed for him,' his classmate wrote. 'We envied him because he could study for a few hours for an exam and still get good grades without too much effort. Everyone loved him. He was such a friendly guy, so helpful and a good person. Of all people, he shouldn’t have had to go,' he added.

While Israel barred from Paris tradeshow French companies supply ...	One company provides a radar with a range of 170 kilometers (105 miles) to Guard's naval vessel while nine others supply Iran's energy sector While France banned Israeli security industry companies from participating in the Euronaval tradeshow in Paris in June, some of the 233 French companies that will take part in the event, were known to be licensed suppliers of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) naval vessels and the country's coast guard and nine companies were listed by Iran as authorized suppliers of its oil and energy industries. Some of the Iranian companies the French firms were doing business with, were under U.S.-imposed sanctions. The annual exhibition features hundreds of international companies that develop naval vessels and weapons and has always included numerous representatives of Israel's defense industries. Although the event is scheduled for June, preparations start many months in advance. An Israeli source said that France has become a symbol of left-wing embargoes on Israel, noting that French companies had asked President Emmanuel Macron to ban Israeli companies for commercial reasons behind the scenes. One French company provided a radar with a maximum range of over 170 kilometers (105 miles) that was installed on an IRGC ship. France said there was never any intention to ban Israeli companies from attending French tradeshows and the French government's position cannot be seen as a boycott of Israeli firms. 'Our support of Israel and its right to defend itself has always been unequivocal,' the Elysee Palace said. 'Proof if that is evident in our decision to continue to make components for the Iron Dome missile defense system.' The palace went on to say that while France has called for a cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon because it is the only way to stop the escalation and achieve regional stability and peace, it would be 'inconsistent to allow the promotion of weapons' used in those fronts, that was harming civilians.' Twelve Israeli companies were interested in exhibiting at the naval fair, and local participation will almost certainly be blocked from the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget, the crown jewel of such exhibitions, should this negative trend continue.

Iran plans to triple military budget, government spokesperson say...	Budget increase submitted by the government to parliament for approval includes an estimated 200% addition, government spokesperson tells local media Iran's government plans to raise its military budget by around 200%, government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani was reported as saying by state media on Tuesday, after Iran and Israel exchanged attacks in recent months. The planned defense budget increase is part of a budget proposal that has been submitted by the government to parliament for approval. 'A considerable raise that amounts to 200% has been witnessed in the country's defense budget,' Mohajerani said, giving no further details. Iran and Israel have been trading missile salvoes for months, with Israel on Saturday striking Iran in retaliation for an Iranian missile barrage against Israel on Oct. 1, much of which Israel said was downed by its air defenses. Tehran said on Monday that it will 'use all available tools' to respond to Israel's weekend attack on military targets in Iran. Iran backs the Hezbollah terror group which is engaged in heavy fighting with IDF forces in Lebanon, and also the Hamas terror group, which is battling the IDF in the Gaza Strip.

One dead, at least three injured in northern Israel rocket strike	24-year-old Mohammed Naim was killed when a rocket hit his home in Tarshiha; IDF reports at least 50 munitions seen crossing from Lebanon toward the Galilee area; rocket marks direct hit in Ma'alot-Tarshiha home 24-year-old Mohammed Naim was killed and at three others were wounded after a missile hit Ma'alot-Tarshiha in Western Galilee, Magen David Adom (MDA) Director Eli Bin reported on Tuesday. Nai'm was critically hurt and later succumbed to his wounds sustained when a rocket made a direct hit on his home. 'It’s a complex scene; we saw extensive destruction in the house and began searching the area,' MDA medic Gilad Benhemo, who was present on the scene, recounted. 'We found an unconscious person who had no pulse and wasn’t breathing.' 'We performed a medical assessment, but his injuries were critical and we had to pronounce his death. MDA teams are providing on-site medical care to several individuals suffering from anxiety,' he added. The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported at least 50 projectiles were located crossing from Lebanon toward northern Israel’s Galilee region earlier on Tuesday. Meanwhile, as the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah continues, the Iran-backed terror group named Naim Qassem as the new head of the terror group after the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah in September. He was deputy secretary-general under Nasrallah since 1991. 'Based on the faith in Allah, our commitment to Islam and our dedication to its principles and purposes, Hezbollah, in accordance with its established mechanism, approves Naim Qassem as secretary-general,' the terror group said in a statement.

They’re still there, tortured and abused': freed hostage Mia rec...	Mia Schem speaks in an event held by Israel's New York consulate and tells of the moments after her kidnapping when she was held inside a cage with five other women who remain captives in Gaza Mia Schem, a former captive released as part of the first hostage deal with Hamas in November 2023, recalled her experiences in Gaza and the harsh conditions she endured. Speaking during a ceremony at the Israeli consulate in New York to commemorate the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the massacre Tuesday overnight, she spoke about the other women who are still held in Gaza. 'I was put in a cage with five young women; they’re still there, tortured and abused,' Schem said at the event. 'I was placed in a dark cage, with no air or light, only 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) high. Each of us had a brutal abduction story; we were wounded and shocked.' 'After 50 days, weak and injured, I was led to the tunnels. Two hours of walking with an armed terrorist in front and one behind, 60 meters (196 feet) underground. I was put in a cage with no light or air. In the cage, I met five young women, each with her own horrific abduction story.' 'We spent five days in that dark cage, with two armed guards switching shifts every 12 hours. I tried to encourage them and promised we’d be freed soon. We were wounded and shocked by what had happened to us. We were innocent young women only weeks earlier. On the fifth day, I was taken out. I managed to hug them and promised they’d be freed the next day, that we’d meet again in our homeland to pick up the pieces.' 'It’s been a year; I’m here physically, but my innocence was left in fields of blood and my heart remains captive in Gaza with five young women still held there, tortured and abused, with no air, in the depths of hell,' she added. 'I stand here before you today — no longer a child but a strong woman who won’t rest until everyone returns from those depths of hell.' Ayelet, the mother of hostage Yonatan Samrano whose body is still held in Gaza, spoke about her son’s abduction at the event. 'An UNRWA social worker kidnapped my son. This person, who worked in an organization meant to do good and alleviate human suffering, kidnapped my son. This UN worker took him after he was shot by terrorists. Today, we mark a year since the darkest, most haunted day since the founding of the Jewish state.' Her words come against the backdrop of a bill approved in the Knesset on Monday banning UNRWA’s activities in Israel. Around 600 guests attended the event, including Israeli-American Council (IAC) CEO Elan Carr, leaders of New York's Jewish community, bereaved families, foreign consuls general, social media influencers, journalists and more. In his speech, Israel's Consul General in New York Ofir Akunis, said, 'What Hamas intended on doing on that day was to destroy Israel. They aimed to commit genocide. As they wrote in their founding charter in 1987 — to destroy the State of Israel and build an Islamic state in its place. 'This wasn't the first massacre in our nation’s history. We've seen many since 1920. But this was certainly the most brutal. If anyone thinks the Jewish people will ever forget or forgive this, they're mistaken. If anyone thinks we'll apologize for defending ourselves, they're wrong.'

US blacklists firms tied to Iran, Pakistan weapons programs	The United States adds 26 companies from Pakistan, China, Egypt, and the UAE to a blacklist, citing support for missile and drone developments and violations of export controls The United States has imposed sanctions on more than two dozen companies, alleging their support for ballistic missile and drone development in Pakistan and Iran. The US Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) announced last week that 26 companies from Pakistan, China, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates were blacklisted due to activities deemed contrary to U.S. national security, including violating export controls, aiding restricted weapons programs, and attempting to bypass sanctions on Russia and Iran. The BIS, a division of the US Commerce Department, stated that 'nine Pakistani entities were added [to the ban list] for acting as front companies for the Advanced Engineering Research Organization, listed in 2014, and seven others for contributing to Pakistan’s ballistic missile program.' Three entities from the UAE and one from Egypt were also blacklisted for allegedly attempting to obtain restricted U.S. parts after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Additionally, six Chinese firms were sanctioned for assisting China’s military and procuring U.S. technology for Iran’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs. According to Thea D. Rozman Kendler, assistant secretary of commerce for export administration at the BIS, the U.S. will continue blocking entities 'that attempt to bypass our controls and endanger U.S. national security.' 'Programs such as Iran’s WMD program, their UAV program, and Pakistan’s ballistic missile program pose significant threats to the national security of the United States and will not be aided by U.S. technologies,' Kendler added. Matthew S. Axelrod, assistant secretary of commerce for export enforcement at the BIS, stated, 'When we identify parties transshipping U.S. items to support WMD and UAV programs in countries like Pakistan and Iran, or aiding Russia’s war efforts, we take action. Today’s listings also make clear that when foreign parties engage in dilatory or evasive conduct with respect to our end-use checks, they will face consequences.' The U.S. State Department in April 2024 acted against four entities involved in weapons of mass destruction proliferation. These entities were accused of supplying crucial materials and technologies to Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, including long-range missile capabilities. The State Department noted that 'three of the targeted companies are based in China, with the fourth in Belarus,' providing missile-related items to Pakistan’s program. In response to American sanctions on entities allegedly linked to Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry voiced concerns, with spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch noting that 'similar listings have occurred before without any evidence being shared.' She suggested that Islamabad was open to transparency discussions to protect legitimate commercial ventures from being 'unfairly impacted by export controls.' Pakistan’s ballistic missile program is a key component of its national defense strategy, developed in response to regional security challenges and the country’s long-standing rivalry with India. As part of Pakistan’s strategic deterrence and conventional strike capabilities, its missile systems are designed to deliver both nuclear warheads and conventional munitions. To manage these weapons, specifically their precision and security during missile operations, Pakistan has implemented a state-of-the-art command and control infrastructure. Additionally, a specialized security force, operating under the leadership of a three-star general, has been deployed exclusively to protect these strategic assets. Arsenal mainly consists of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, with ongoing advancements in cruise missile capabilities This security framework aims to prevent unauthorized access, safeguard the country’s defense assets, and ensure swift and effective response in any scenario. The arsenal mainly consists of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, with ongoing advancements in cruise missile capabilities. Among Pakistan’s short- and medium-range missiles, the Shaheen-III has a range of approximately 1,710 miles, while the Ababeel can reach up to 1,400 miles. Islamabad has consistently emphasized that its advancement in missile technology is to maintain a credible deterrent and achieve strategic balance in South Asia. Dr. Maria Sultan, the Islamabad-based chair of the South Asian Strategic Stability Institute University and Pakistan’s leading defense and security analyst, told The Media Line: 'Pakistan’s ballistic missile program is indigenous and not reliant on U.S. technology, so the sanctions have minimal impact on its development.' 'Moreover,' she continued, 'if any listed companies were trading with the U.S., it suggests there were compliance lapses on the U.S. side.' Sultan added that the 'U.S. has lost its role as the leader of the non-proliferation regime since it has been the sole facilitator of not only leading an arms race in South Asia but has contributed towards the defense industry development of India after STA-1.' STA-1 or Strategic Trade Authorization-1, is a U.S. designation that enables certain countries to access advanced and sensitive American technology, including dual-use items for both civilian and military purposes. In 2018, India became the first South Asian country to receive STA-1 status. 'In a faltering U.S. Middle East policy, the creation of a false narrative surrounding sanctions against Pakistani and Iranian companies serves to deflect pressure and reflects an irresponsible unilateral approach to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which has been previously undermined by U.S. sanctions on Iran,' Sultan explained. The JCPOA is the 2015 agreement between Iran and six world powers—the U.S., UK, France, Russia, China, and Germany—to limit Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. 'The timing and nature of these sanctions appear more aimed at appeasing a domestic audience rather than genuinely addressing missile proliferation,' she added, stressing that 'this strategy ultimately detracts from the necessary efforts to control the proliferation of missiles.'

Hezbollah names Naim Qassem as new chief	Long-serving deputy secretary-general of the terror group is approved by Hezbollah's religious council after the designated successor of Hasan Nasrallah, Hashem Safieddine is also killed in a targeted strike Hezbollah on Tuesday named Naim Qassem as the new head of the terror group after the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah in September. He was deputy secretary-general under Nasrallah since 1991. 'Based on the faith in Allah, our commitment to Islam and our dedication to its principles and purposes, Hezbollah, in accordance with its established mechanism, approves Naim Qassem at secretary-general,' the terror group said in a statement. 'We are committed to working together to achieve Hezbollah's aims and to preserve the flames of resistance and our flag held high until victory is achieved.' Qassem was named as the new chief of the terror group after Nasrallah who served in the role for the past 32 years was assassinated in a targeted attack on his bunker in Beirut's Dahieh quarter along with other senior members, including the commander of South Lebanon, Ali Karaki. Israel also assassinated Hashem Safieddine, who was designated to succeed Nasrallah in a strike earlier in October. His death was confirmed by the terror group last week, three weeks after the IDF's targeted attack. Qassem who had been speaking publicly for Hezbollah even before Nasrallah's killing, said in a speech earlier this month that a cease-fire agreement could be reached apart from the war in Gaza. 'The solution is a cease-fire. Not from a position of weakness,' he said. 'We are no longer supporting Gaza and are now in war with Israel.' He said that since Israel was attacking all parts of Lebanon, the terror group had the right to target Tel Aviv, Haifa and beyond, as Nasrallah had wanted.

Iran threatens Israel in UN, US warns Tehran against further aggr...	Emergency UN Security Council session sees Iranian representative reiterating Tehran's right to act against Israel's retaliatory strike; U.S. says further Iranian aggression will have 'severe consequences' Iran's UN Ambassador Amir Saied said in an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Monday that his country reserves the 'inherent right to respond at a time of its choosing,' to what he called 'this act of aggression. The session was held to discuss Israel’s retaliatory attack in Tehran on Saturday. 'Israel’s attack constitutes a breach of international law. The U.S.’s support of Israel encouraged it to continue its aggression in Gaza and Lebanon,' Saied said. U.S. Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the council there would be 'severe consequences' should Tehran take any further aggressive action against Jerusalem. 'We will not hesitate to act in self-defense. Let there be no confusion. The United States does not want to see further escalation. We believe this should be the end of the direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran,' she said. 'As we have stated time and time again, we have the right and duty to defend ourselves and will use all the means at our disposal to protect the citizens of Israel,' Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon told the council. He also demanded the international body recognize the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization, impose 'immediate, paralyzing sanctions against Iran’s military and economic infrastructure,' and implored the council to 'take every step necessary to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear state.' Meanwhile, members of Israel’s Security Cabinet discussed three main issues Sunday overnight including the Hezbollah drone strike on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea and deliberated on how to respond to Iran over the attack. Military representatives presented several options in the meeting; however, some ministers present were 'carried away' with their proposals and no decision was agreed on.

Strides in Lebanon cease-fire negotiations, Israeli officials say	Hochstein to arrive to finalize the deal stipulating a 60-day period of adjustment leaving IDF troops in tactical positions; Hezbollah to be kept north of Litani River while the Lebanese army to deploy thousands to the border; Russia to play a supervision role Senior Israeli officials said the negotiations on a cease-fire deal in Lebanon are 'in advanced stages.' White House special envoy Amos Hochstein may travel to Israel and Lebanon before the November 5 U.S. presidential elections, to attempt to reach final agreements. If the talks advance, the IDF will begin to withdraw most of its troops and redeploy forces in South Lebanon and leave areas where their mission to remove the threat from Radwan forces, has been completed, and likely remain only where there is tactical significance. The officials in Israel said that Lebanon's situation has completely changed after the IDF offensive and that there is an agreement in Beirut to disconnect both the Lebanon and Gazan fronts. They stressed the fact that fighting would continue while negotiations are ongoing and until they are completed. Western intelligence sources believe Iran would allow Hezbollah to agree to a ceasefire, and perhaps even encourage it, even if the fighting in Gaza does not end. The Israeli officials said a cease-fire agreement would begin with a 60-day acclimation period during which Hezbollah and the IDF withhold their fire and the Lebanese army will deploy to the south, while a new mechanism to supervise the region will be considered but there will be no new resolution passed in the UN Security Council. French and American officials said recently that Hezbollah, which suffered severe blows and lost all of its leadership, has been bolstered in the past two weeks, by the growing number of casualties among IDF soldiers. 'This is an opportunity that must not be missed,' they said. The proposed deal to be agreed by Israel, Lebanon, the U.S. and others, includes three components. The first is a wider implementation of UN resolution 1701, passed after the 2006 Second Lebanon War, that would ensure there would be no Hezbollah terrorists south of the Litani River, and at a significant distance from Metula. Lebanon's army is to deploy 5,000 to 10,000 troops along the border. UNIFIL forces will be increased, perhaps some, replaced by French, British and German forces. Israel has approached those countries to see if they would agree. The second component is the establishment of an international mechanism to supervise the area and consider violation claims by any of the sides. Israeli officials said the U.S> has agreed that if Hezbollah violates the agreement, for example by building fortifications south of the Litani, and the Lebanese army or UNIFIL fail to quickly respond, the IDF would be able to take prolonged action to remove the threat. Israel asked for a letter from U.S. President Joe Biden, stating Israel's right to self-defense, making it clear that the IDF would be able to act. American officials did not respond to questions on the matter. The third component in the agreement being negotiated is preventing Hezbollah from rearming. This means blocking military means, to be identified as banned, from being brought in by air, land or sea. Russia expressed a willingness to assist in implementing the agreement and is destined to play a part in stabilizing the region in Lebanon and Syria. 'The Russians will have a special role in preventing further escalation,' a foreign source said. Israel will engage with the Kremlin directly and is interested in Russian participation, in the hopes that it would contribute to the agreement's implementation and also to reduce its dependence on U.S. involvement. Netanyahu emissaries have been trying to enlist other countries to join supervision roles in the pending agreement. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer has been working with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan while Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has discussed the matter with Hochstein.

Guterres says UNRWA indispensable, after Israel banns agency	UN secretary-general says bill passed by Knesset could have devastating consequences for Palestinian refugees and will be detrimental for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Monday that the implementation of a law banning the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) from operating in Israel 'could have devastating consequences for Palestine refugees in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which is unacceptable.' The Knesset passed a law to cut official ties with and halt the activity of the UNRWA, some of whose operators are suspected of participating in the massacres on October 7. The law passed by a vote of 92-10. 'There is no alternative to UNRWA,' Guterres said in a statement. 'The implementation of these laws would be detrimental for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and for peace and security in the region as a whole. As I said before, UNRWA is indispensable,' adding he would bring the matter to the attention of the 193-member U.N. General Assembly. Under the new law, UNRWA will not 'operate any institution, provide any service, or conduct any activity, whether directly or indirectly,' in the sovereign territory of Israel. In effect, UNRWA's activities in East Jerusalem will be terminated and the body's powers will be transferred to Israel's responsibility and control. Israel revealed the involvement of UNRWA employees in the Hamas atrocities of Oct. 7, 2023 and the identity of another member of the organization who was a Hamas operative in Lebanon. Others are active in both Hamas and Islamic Jihad.

KCNA said a delegation led by Choe left on Monday for an official visit to Russia, without elaborating. Her visit comes as NATO joined Seoul, Washington and Kyiv in confirming Pyongyang's dispatch of troops to Russia, saying North Korean military units had been deployed to Russia's Kursk region near the Ukraine border. The Pentagon said North Korea has sent 10,000 troops to eastern Russia for training, up from its estimate of 3,000 last Wednesday, adding Washington will not impose new limits on Ukraine's use of American weapons if North Korea enters the fight.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk3l0y6xyg	2024-10-28T14:22:09-07:00	
This is where where 1,000 armed Radwan fighters were poised to in...	Ynet reporter on the ground with troops in South Lebanon: For over 20 years, Hezbollah planned to capture Metula to invade the Upper Galilee; The IDF's 769th Brigade destroyed underground facilities and arms depots in Kila, a major Hezbollah hub, thwarting their invasion plans For more than two decades, Hezbollah has been plotting to capture the border town of Metula as a launch point to push into the Upper Galilee and northern Israel. However, since the outbreak of hostilities a year ago, and particularly in recent weeks, the Israel Defense Forces have been actively dismantling Hezbollah's attack infrastructure in the nearby village of Kila, located in southern Lebanon. Under the leadership of the 769th Regional Brigade, part of the 91st Division, Israeli forces have discovered and destroyed dozens of underground facilities, weapon depots, observation posts and hundreds of terrorist infrastructures scattered throughout and within Kila village. This village is considered one of Hezbollah's main terror strongholds, from which over 1,000 armed Radwan fighters were poised to invade Israel at a moment's notice. A tour of the ravaged village and neighboring Lebanese areas quickly reveals the scale of the destruction and the high level of Hezbollah's readiness to execute their 'Conquer the Galilee' plan, a strategy they announced in 2011 and have been preparing for ever since. 'The village of Kila represents all the evil and what Hezbollah intended to do,' explained Colonel Avraham Marciano, commander of the 769th Brigade. He added that, from this Shiite village adjacent to Metula, 'there was a plan for several battalions to storm into Israeli territory.' The IDF's heavy machinery is carrying out extensive demolition in the area, continuing to destroy homes and terrorist infrastructures located so close to the border wall. Just yards away from Metula's orchards and across from the Har Tzofiya neighborhood, near a local gas station owned by Hezbollah, Marciano described an exposed underground terror tunnel that did not breach Israeli soil. 'Fifty yards from here, within the rubble, we uncovered an underground shaft they planned to use,' he detailed. 'It was several hundred yards long, and from its entrance the terrorists planned to go underground on the main street of the village, collect their equipment, prepare for an attack and emerge from here.' Forces are now destroying this tunnel, along with other above and below-ground terrorist infrastructures. David, one of the soldiers protecting us, participated in uncovering the tunnel. 'We found it with the excavation equipment,' he recounted. 'There's no doubt we halted its further digging. In almost every house here, we uncovered terrorist infrastructures. Whether it's shafts, tunnels, or just weapons, in every house, you can find weapons, ammunition, vests, combat gear, or medical supplies.' In nearby areas, Hezbollah set up observation posts from which they monitored movement in Israel for years. Since the conflict began, the Lebanese Shiite terror organization has used these posts to direct fire and launch direct attacks on Israeli communities, including Kfar Yuval. 'From this point, they fired at the Ayalon family home while Mira and her son Barak were having lunch in their kitchen,' Colonel Marciano described. 'Today, we are settling scores and destroying Hezbollah's infrastructures.' He explained that the military activity in the area, which oversees the northern communities, aims to 'destroy the infrastructures, seize the weapons – and prevent Hezbollah's surprise invasion capability from Kila village.' According to the colonel: 'We're doing similar things in other villages. This is how the operation looks. Our response, besides eliminating the terrorists, their commanders, and the commanders of their commanders, is to ensure that the infrastructure does not exist.' However, he acknowledged this activity does not address the remote and steep-trajectory anti-tank fire. For example, during the tour of villages near Metula, they repeatedly took shelter due to mortar fire from the nearby village of Al-Khiam, where the IDF is not operating. Marciano emphasized that the forces on the ground are vigorously working to destroy Hezbollah infrastructures. 'We live every day as if it's the last day of the maneuver,' he said. 'We have a sense of activity and urgency. The machinery doesn't stop, the soldiers don't stop. The soldiers even push us, wanting to move forward and do the work. We don't want to stop.' He promised that 'we are doing everything we can – and everything that needs to be done – to ensure that the residents of the north can live here safely. We've waited for this for a year. Today we stand here, realizing what we've waited for, not because we are war-hungry; quite the opposite, we want peace. And for that, we need to come from a position of strength and bring this strength and victory to the people of Israel, who have waited for it for so long.' 'Hezbollah needs to flee, feel hunted, lose all its infrastructures, all the operatives we can take out now, and if we need to go deeper – we will.'

The United States warned Iran at the United Nations Security Council on Monday of 'severe consequences' if it undertakes any further aggressive acts against Israel or U.S. personnel in the Middle East. 'We will not hesitate to act in self defense. Let there be no confusion. The United States does not want to see further escalation. We believe this should be the end of the direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran,' U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the 15-member council. The Security Council met after Israel struck missile factories and other sites in Iran before dawn on Saturday. It was retaliation for Iran's Oct. 1 attack on Israel with about 200 ballistic missiles. Iran's U.N. Ambassador Amir Saied Iravani accused Washington of being 'complicit' through military support for its ally. 'Iran has consistently championed diplomacy,' he told the council. 'However, as a sovereign state, the Islamic Republic of Iran reserves its inherent right to respond at a time of its choosing to this act of aggression.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjamvt6ejl	2024-10-28T13:52:37-07:00

Yemen's Houthis said on Monday that they targeted three ships in the Red Sea and Arabian Sea, attacks they called part of their efforts to enforce a naval blockade on Israel. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said in a televised address the vessels were targeted for attempting to approach ports bound for Israel. According to the latest data from LSEG, all three targeted vessels were Liberia-registered. One of the vessels, identified by the Houthis as Motaro, was last seen off Yemen's western coast in the Red Sea, en route from Egypt's Suez Canal to Shanghai, according to LSEG data. Another vessel, the SC Montreal, was reportedly targeted in the Arabian Sea while travelling from Seychelles' Port Victoria to Salalah, Oman. The third vessel, the Maersk Kowloon, was tracked by LSEG in the western Indian Ocean, also en route from Salalah. The Houthis said they will continue these actions until Israel halts its offensive on Gaza and Lebanon.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkghiyaxjl	2024-10-28T13:49:55-07:00

Major Guy Yaacov Nezri, 25, dies a week after being injured in northern Gaza Strip; He told high school students: 'We're here to fight and stay alive. It's good to live for our country, and I'm not here to die' Major Guy Yaacov Nezri, 25, from Atlit, commander of a platoon in the 52nd Battalion of the 401st Brigade, died of his wounds after being severely wounded in a battle in the northern Gaza Strip on October 19, the IDF announced on Monday evening. Since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, 772 soldiers have fallen, including 361 who were killed during fighting in the Gaza Strip. Nezri was seriously injured in the incident in which Staff Sergeant Ofir Berkovich, 20, from Modi'in Maccabim Reut, and Sergeant Elishai Young, 19, from Dimona, were killed after being hit by anti-tank missile fire in the battle in Jabaliya in northern Gaza. He is survived by his parents, a twin sister and a brother. His funeral will be held in Atlit. Tamar, his twin sister, posted a video of Nezri on Facebook, before his death was determined. 'Blessed are the people that have these men as their commanders. My brother, the hero who was seriously injured by anti-tank missile fire in Gaza, speaking to the students of the Hanasi School in Haifa, eight months before the injury. These are the words he chooses to use. We love life, fight for life, we are here to stay,' she wrote. Tamar added: 'Our nation is a strong nation that has survived difficult wars and suffered many losses and has always stood on its feet, with its head held high. Today marks the anniversary of the Iron Swords War. Guy fought for a year for a better life in our country, that was the goal and that's where we're going. We are not afraid of a long journey. Guy is still hospitalized and fighting for his life. Devote this day to his healing and the healing of all the wounded of this war, who sacrificed their bodies and souls so that we can live here united and loving!' In the meeting that his sister wrote about, Nezri told the students: 'I want to tell you something else. It's good to live for our country. It's good to live for our country! And I'm not here to die. I'll tell you the truth, we are here to fight and remain alive, to appreciate the continuity of the nation of Israel. The people of Israel are a strong people, they will not remain as we saw them on October 7. This is not the people of Israel. It is a people that has experienced destruction - And just as it falls, it also gets up very quickly and becomes even stronger.' Asif Izak, head of the Hof HaCarmel Regional Council, said: 'Guy was the salt of the earth, who grew up in Hof HaCarmel as a member of a deep-rooted and moral family. On behalf of the entire Hof HaCarmel community, I would like to hug the dear Nezri family, and hope that we will be worthy of the best of our sons that we lost, including Guy.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1l00cotx1l	2024-10-28T13:43:58-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/28/Hkz92walJe/Hkz92walJe_0_36_736_414_0_small.jpg

Knesset passes law banning UNRWA activity in Israel, despite oppo...	Under the law which passed overwhelmingly, an agreement from 1967 that allowed the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency to work in Israel will be canceled, and UNRWA activities in the country will cease. Some of the agency's employees are suspected of participating in the massacres on October 7. US is 'very concerned' The Knesset plenum approved Monday evening in its second and third readings a law to cut official ties with and halt the activity of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, some of whose operators are suspected of participating in the massacres on October 7. The law passed by a vote of 92-10. Under the new law, UNRWA will not 'operate any institution, provide any service, or conduct any activity, whether directly or indirectly,' in the sovereign territory of Israel. In effect, UNRWA's activities in East Jerusalem will be terminated and the body's powers will be transferred to Israel's responsibility and control. Israel revealed the involvement of UNRWA employees in the Hamas atrocities of Oct. 7, 2023 and the identity of another member of the organization who was a Hamas operative in Lebanon. Others are active in both Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee Yuli Edelstein said at the beginning of the debate in the plenary: 'As part of the committee's discussions on the law, a video was shown that proves the involvement of UNRWA personnel in kidnapping a body to the Gaza Strip and other evidence of their activity in Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza. In addition, the person who commanded the massacre in the Be'eri bomb shelter, where 16 Israelis were murdered and from which four were kidnapped to Gaza, was a UNRWA terrorist.' 'In light of this, and since it has been proven to the State of Israel that UNRWA and its employees acted against the State of Israel, the State must determine that UNRWA's activities in its territory will be stopped,' Edelstein also said. 'The State of Israel will provide every service it is obligated to provide to its citizens and residents in all those places where UNRWA operated, coordinated by the Jerusalem Municipality. There is no place for enemies in the heart of the capital of the Jewish people.' One of the law's author's, Likud lawmaker Boaz Bismuth, said UNRWA's work has been counterproductive for years. 'If you really want stability, if you really want security, if you want real peace in the Middle East, organizations like UNRWA won't bring you there,' said Bismuth. 'If the United Nations is not willing to clean this organization from terrorism, from Hamas activists, then we have to take measures to make sure that they cannot harm our people ever again,' lawmaker Sharren Haskel, another author of the law, said. 'The international community could have taken responsibility and made sure that they used the proper organizations to facilitate humanitarian aid, like the World Food Organization, like UNICEF, and many others who work all around the world.' During the voting, Kobi Samerano, the father of Jonathan Samerano, who was murdered on October 7 and whose body was kidnapped into Gaza by a UNRWA worker, was present in the plenum. Despite the broad support for the legislation, both the coalition and the opposition voiced concern among that the vote or implementation would be delayed because Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been under great pressure in recent weeks from both the United Nations and the United States, due to the lack of an alternative body that would provide a humanitarian response for the Palestinians in Gaza. On Sunday, senior officials in the Foreign Ministry warned that if the legislation stating that ties with UNRWA must be severed is passed in the second and third readings in the Knesset Israel would be suspended from the United Nations, since this is a violation of the organization's charter. The foreign ministers of Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and Great Britain issued a joint statement Monday before the vote calling on Israel to stop the legislation, expressing 'grave concern,' especially in light of the humanitarian situation in Gaza. 'UNRWA provides vital and life-saving humanitarian assistance and basic services to Palestinian refugees in Gaza, East Jerusalem, the West Bank and throughout the region,' the statement reads. 'This will have devastating consequences on an already difficult humanitarian situation, which is rapidly deteriorating, especially in northern Gaza.' U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that Washington 'has made it clear to Israel that it is very concerned about the legislation that could ban the agency's activities in the Gaza Strip, because it plays a role in providing irreplaceable humanitarian aid. The humanitarian aid does not reach the residents of Jabaliya, where the IDF has increased its activity, and the U.S. will not agree to that.' In recent days, the U.S. Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew and officials at the embassy have appealed to Yesh Atid Chairman and Opposition Leader Yair Lapid, Yisrael Beitenu Party head Avigdor Liberman, and Nastional Unity party head Benny Gantz, with a request that they agree to postpone the advancement of the legislation at least until after the U.S. presidential elections. Lapid reportedly told U.S. officials that he disagreed with them and that the law is correct and appropriate, leading Liberman and Gantz to also reject the U.S officials' request. Knesset members from the Arab Hadash-Ta'al party objected, and Knesset member Ahmed Tibi said: 'Those who support this bill are those who do not recognize the Palestinian people. It is not new that people here in the Knesset ask to stop the activities of UNRWA .There will be no need for UNRWA when the occupation ends and a Palestinian state is established.'

Joe Biden waits in line 40 minutes to cast early ballot in Delawa...	The current US president chatted with voters and pushed a woman in a wheelchair in line ahead of him President Joe Biden, who will end a decades-long public career in January, cast an early ballot in the 2024 general election. Biden voted on Monday at the state of Delaware Department of Elections, not far from his home outside Wilmington, Delaware at an early voting site, where voters were lined up down the street to cast ballots. It’s a bittersweet moment for Biden, who decided to end his reelection campaign in July because of growing concerns about his health and Democrats’ worries about his chances of defeating former President Donald Trump. Biden chatted with voters as he waited in line to cast his ballot, and helped push an older woman in a wheelchair who was ahead of him. The president waited in line for about 40 minutes before he cast his ballot. He handed his identification to the election worker, who had him sign a form and announced: 'Joseph Biden now voting.' As the president cast his ballot behind a black drape, some first-time voters were announced and the room erupted in cheers for them. Outside the polling place, Biden was asked by reporters if he thought Democrats - including Vice President Kamala Harris - would win. 'I think we will,' he said. He also was asked about the war in Gaza and said that it 'must end.' Biden emphasized: 'We need a cease-fire. We have to stop this war. It has to end. It has to end. It has to end.' For all but a few years since 1970, Biden has either held office or been running for one during election season.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkzkn8plje	2024-10-28T10:56:14-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/28/SkokoSTxJl/SkokoSTxJl_0_148_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Northern mayor laments removal of protective barriers on border w...	A year after regular attacks from Hezbollah began, the protective barriers placed in major intersections in northern Israel have been removed, which has Kiryat Shmona Mayor Avichai Stern concerned; 'It feels like a hasty move, signaling to residents that it’s safe to return home' Israeli Defense Forces have dismantled large protective barriers that were put in place about a year ago along major traffic routes near Kiryat Shmona, extending to Metula and Kfar Yuval on the northern border. This decision seems linked to the decreased threat of direct anti-tank missile attacks following military operations in southern Lebanon, especially over the past month. Mayor Avichai Stern of Kiryat Shmona voiced strong concerns over the timing of this decision. 'Why take them down now? They should be removed after the conflict is truly over. What’s the rush? It feels like a hasty move, signaling to residents that it’s safe to return home,' he said. Stern is worried that, while the army claims to have destroyed nearby terror infrastructures, the threat from more distant villages, which could still launch anti-tank missiles, remains unaddressed. He emphasizes that these concrete walls were installed as a protective measure when the military was not present in Lebanon. Although Stern understands the rationale behind their removal, he stresses that, for residents, these walls represent the necessary defense against Hezbollah forces just across the border. He expressed a personal wish to live in a city without these 'ugly defensive walls,' but insisted they should only be removed when there is absolute certainty they are no longer needed. Stern suspects political pressures might be pushing the IDF to wrap up operations in Lebanon, achieving only a temporary distancing of Hezbollah. He also fears a potential agreement that allows Hezbollah to regroup, which he believes should not be permitted.

ICC prosecutor who charged Netanyahu with war crimes says will co...	Karim Khan has called for internal investigation into allegations made by a female aide; Court officials say accusation part of an Israeli intelligence smear campaign to discredit the court. The International Criminal Court’s top prosecutor has called for an internal investigation into allegations he tried to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship and groped her. Karim Khan’s request Monday follows an investigation by The Associated Press detailing allegations made in May by two co-workers in whom the woman confided as the chief prosecutor was preparing to seek charges against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and leaders of Hamas over their actions in Gaza. Khan has previously said there was 'no truth' to the misconduct allegations and court officials told the AP they may have been made as part of an Israeli intelligence smear campaign to discredit the court. In a social media post Monday, the British jurist complained that recent media reporting had breached the confidentiality of the court’s internal proceedings and spread 'disinformation' that violated his rights as well as those of the alleged victim. Khan said he would cooperate fully with any inquiry made under the court’s Independent Oversight Mechanism — the same watchdog that closed an inquiry just five days after receiving the third-party complaint. The inquiry should be 'permitted to do its work without interference so that the crucial work of the Office may continue unimpeded,' he said, declining further comment. The court’s watchdog previously determined no investigation was necessary, and didn’t question Khan about his behavior, when the alleged victim opted against filing a formal complaint. People close to the woman, who still works at the court, told AP that she opted against a complaint at the time because she didn’t trust the internal watchdog and has since asked the body of member-states that oversees the ICC to launch an external probe. AP pieced together details of the accusations through whistleblower documents shared with the watchdog and interviews with eight ICC officials and individuals close to the woman. All spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the allegations or fear of retaliation. Among the allegations told to AP is that Khan during a foreign trip asked the woman to rest with him on a hotel bed and then 'sexually touched her,' according to the documents. Later, he came to her room at 3 a.m. and knocked on the door for 10 minutes. Other allegedly nonconsensual behavior cited in the documents included locking the door of his office and sticking his hand in her pocket. He also allegedly asked her on several occasions to go on a vacation together. While the watchdog could not determine wrongdoing before ending its initial inquiry, it nonetheless urged Khan in a memo to minimize contact with the woman to protect the rights of all involved and safeguard the court’s integrity.

The International Criminal Court's prosecutor Karim Khan has asked the ICC's oversight mechanism to open an immediate investigation into allegations of misconduct made against him, he said on Monday. According to the prosecutor, the investigations should cover the allegations and disinformation surrounding them, and he will cooperate fully. Last week, Khan denied accusations of unspecified misconduct after the court's governing body confirmed that it had been notified of the allegation. The Independent Oversight Mechanism said in its annual report for 2024 that the alleged victim in the Khan case would not explicitly confirm the allegations in talks with the oversight body earlier this year and therefore no formal inquiry had been launched. ICC judges are reviewing Khan's request in May for arrest warrants against Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his defense chief and Hamas leaders.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rja7qrax1g	2024-10-28T09:31:37-07:00

Iran executes Iranian-German national after terrorism conviction	Iran executed Iranian-German national Jamshid Sharmahd after he was convicted of carrying out terrorist attacks, Iranian state media said on Monday. Sharmahd, who also holds U.S. residency, was sentenced to death in 2023 on charges of 'corruption on earth.' He was accused by Iran of heading a pro-monarchist group accused of a deadly 2008 bombing and planning other attacks in the country. Sharmahd's arrest was announced in 2020 in an intelligence ministry statement that described him as 'the ringleader of the terrorist Tondar group, who directed armed and terrorist acts in Iran from America.' Based in Los Angeles, the little-known Kingdom Assembly of Iran, or Tondar, says it seeks to restore the Iranian monarchy that was overthrown by the 1979 Islamic revolution.

About a decade ago, he founded The Daily Wire, and later a popular podcast - The Ben Shapiro Show - which was ranked second in the United States by Podtrac. Since then, he has not hesitated to confront Israel's opponents, and become a one-man advocacy enterprise. In a special interview with Ynetnews, he talks about disappointment with the West, which he says has normalized antisemitism and hatred of Israel; asks that we learn a historical lesson from what he says Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar understood well - that social divisions are the country's weak point; and explains why Israel repeatedly fails in the propaganda war. 'If Trump is elected, I think that the war in the Middle East will come to a swift and decisive conclusion,' he says, adding that 'I have significant doubts about the what a Kamala Harris administration would look like for Israel.' Shapiro spoke with Ynetnews on the occasion of the staging in Israel of a musical he wrote which has taken on new meaning following the October 7 massacre, 'We Will Rise,' by the Aspaklaria Theater, in collaboration with the Israel Sinfonietta Be'er Sheva.

Erdoğan accuses Israel of genocide, and then bombs the Kurds	Turkey conducted over 130 airstrikes across most towns and cities along Syria's northern border hitting civilian homes, factories, and oil facilities of the Kurds, according to reports Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has emerged as one of Israel's most vocal critics since the onset of the war. He has urged the Arab world to unite against Israel, claiming that it has no intention of stopping in Gaza and will extend its actions to Turkey. Erdoğan repeatedly refers to the ongoing war against Hamas as 'genocide,' even labeling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as 'the Hitler of our time.' Meanwhile, Erdoğan continues to carry out ruthless operations against the Kurds in Turkey, Syria and Iraq. Wednesday marked a new escalation in the already strained relations between Turkey and the Kurdish groups seeking independence. An attack targeted the headquarters of Turkey's aerospace industry company TUSAS in Ankara, resulting in five fatalities and 22 injuries. Videos from the scene circulated on social media. According to Turkish reports, at least two assailants were involved, and they were killed. Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya stated immediately after the strike that it was 'very likely' that the attackers were Kurdish operatives from the PKK, or Kurdistan Workers' Party, which Turkey designates as a terrorist organization. On Friday, the PKK claimed responsibility for the attack. Even before the PKK took responsibility, Turkey launched intensive air and ground strikes against Kurdish positions in Syria and Iraq. According to the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat, positions of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which includes a significant Kurdish military component in Syria, were targeted. Turkey's Defense Ministry announced on Wednesday evening that it had attacked PKK targets in northern Iraq and northern Syria: 'In accordance with our rights to self-defense, an air operation was conducted against terrorist targets in northern Iraq and Syria. A total of 32 targets were successfully destroyed, and operations are ongoing.' Following the events, Erdoğan declared that 'no terrorist organization attacking our country will be able to realize its hopes.' According to a report on Sunday from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an organization linked to the Syrian opposition based in London, Turkish forces have intensified their air and ground assaults in northeastern Syria since Wednesday. The report noted that over 100 airstrikes had been conducted, including 84 drone strikes and 18 by fighter jets. Ground assaults also were reported in several areas, resulting in 17 deaths and more than 60 injuries. The observatory indicated that many civilian homes, oil facilities and factories were damaged in the attacks. Protests against the Turkish escalation were reported in several locations across Syria. Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, associated with Hezbollah, also covered the Turkish strikes, noting that sources on the ground indicated Turkey had conducted over 130 airstrikes across most towns and cities along Syria's northern border within four days. In the targeted areas in Syria, some claimed that Turkey was using the Ankara attack as a pretext to target groups unrelated to the incident. Syria's media reported that Turkey employed a significant amount of ammunition during these strikes. Turkey's Defense Ministry claimed it was targeting 'terrorists,' but the reality is that Turkey has long fought against the Kurdish quest for independence, ruthlessly attacking Kurds in Turkey, Syria and Iraq out of fear that the ethnic group might realize its aspirations in the Kurdistan region. The historical animosity between the PKK and Turkey is not new. The PKK is a Kurdish armed organization founded in Turkey in 1978 by Abdullah Öcalan and Kurdish activists. Initially focused on advocating for Kurdish rights, it later sought independence for southeastern Turkey. In its early years, the PKK was viewed as a political movement, but it is now recognized as a terrorist organization in Turkey and many Western countries, including the U.S. A report from Saudi Arabia's Al-Arabiya network highlighted significant events influencing the PKK, such as Öcalan's arrest in 1999 and his subsequent life imprisonment. The report noted that the PKK has carried out attacks against the Turkish military and government sites, primarily in southeastern Turkey. The conflict between Turkey and the PKK spans borders, particularly since Turkey accuses the organization of strengthening ties with Kurds in neighboring countries like Iraq and Syria, launching attacks on PKK positions in those states. Efforts to reach a cease-fire between the two sides have repeatedly failed, as Ankara remains firmly opposed to the PKK's demands for independence. Over the years, there have been numerous reports of connections between Israel and the Kurds, whose population numbers in the millions and spans Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Armenia. The Kurds have often expressed warm sentiments toward Israel. In Iraq, the autonomy achieved by the Kurds is referred to as the Iraqi Kurdistan.

Hostage negotiations summit in Doha concludes with progress repor...	Talks cover several proposals by mediators, with sources indicating momentum toward aligning these frameworks within the week; officials aim to convene follow-up summit, potentially engaging Hamas directly A negotiation summit in Doha concluded on Monday with reported progress toward a unified framework for a hostage release plan, following intensive discussions between Mossad Director David Barnea, CIA Director William Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Al Thani. The talks, which saw Barnea remain overnight in Qatar, reportedly covered Egyptian, American and Qatari proposals, with sources indicating momentum toward aligning these frameworks within the week. Officials aim to convene a follow-up summit with top intelligence leaders, including Egypt’s new intelligence chief Hassan Rashad, potentially engaging Hamas directly. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Sunday floated a proposal involving a 48-hour cease-fire to facilitate the release of four hostages in exchange for some Palestinian prisoners, describing it as a trust-building measure. Hamas welcomed the Egyptian proposal but expressed concern over the lack of Israeli guarantees and reiterated its stance that no deal could be finalized without a comprehensive cease-fire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, including the strategic Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors. Israeli and Qatari sources familiar with the discussions at the summit noted reluctance from both sides on smaller deals, as both parties are focused on a more comprehensive agreement that could potentially involve both Gaza and Lebanon. Negotiators also considered the broader regional context, with some Israeli officials insisting that any truce in Lebanon would depend on Iran and Hezbollah pressuring Hamas toward an agreement. A diplomatic source quoted by Lebanon’s LBCI said the Doha talks had shown incremental progress on Gaza and noted genuine interest in a future prisoner exchange between Hamas and Israel.

The first fallen soldier in Oct. 7: 'Steinberg was always a compa...	Nahal Brigade Commander Colonel Yehonatan Steinberg was killed on October 7 and left a void in the hearts of his loved ones; his widow shares stories about the revered commander When the late Colonel Yehonatan Steinberg left his house on the morning of Simchat Torah last year, his wife felt that she had no reason to worry. She was already used to sudden calls to base; on Saturdays, holidays, at odd hours. ''There is an infiltration of terrorists from the Gaza Strip and I am going to my soldiers in Kerem Shalom.' I walked him to the door, gave him some cookies and sent him on his way. Nothing unusual,' recalled Yiska Steinberg. However, she had another reason to be calm. During Operation Guardian of the Walls, Yehonatan's force was under fire in the West Bank while he was the Binyamin Division commander. His communications officer was slightly injured, as well as an officer who was with them, but he came out unscathed. 'Yehonatan managed the event calmly and rescued his men under fire,' continued Yiska. 'This is the moment when I said to myself: My husband is protected. There is no one who can beat him.' It was an illusion. In the morning hours of October 7, 2023, the commander of the Nahal Brigade, Colonel Yehonatan Steinberg, was killed in battle against a squad of 12 terrorists near the Ma'on junction near Nir Oz. He was the first IDF soldier whose name was allowed to be published. Col. Steinberg, 42, left behind six children and a wife. Two more brigade commanders died in battle that morning: Colonel Asaf Hamami and Colonel Roy Joseph Levy. More than a year has passed since then, but Yehonatan's spirit, legacy, and dedication continue to accompany the Nahal Brigade. The brigade lost 53 officers and soldiers in the war, 22 of them on the cursed October 7 Massacre. 'He wasn't the commander of the sector but he summoned the brigade and went ahead, knowing he was there alone under fire,' said the current brigade commander, Col. Yair Zuckerman, who replaced Steinberg after his death. 'When Yehonatan detected the Nukhba forces, he got out of the vehicle and fought. His act of heroism was later reflected in all the brigade's fighting in Gaza: the initiative, the desire to be in front, to complete every task. When the commander behaves like this, it affects us all.' The wedding and an operation in Jenin We met last week at the spot where Steinberg fell: his widow Yiska, Col. Zuckerman and two of Yoni's subordinates: the commander of the 932nd Battalion, Lt. Col. Dotan Malul, and the brigade's logistics officer, Major Shahaf Cohen. Somewhere between Ma'on Junction and Eshkol Park, the late Lieutenant Colonel Yehonatan (Barnash) Tzor, commander of the Nahal patrol, who also came from home into the line of fire, was also killed in battle on October 7. At the place of Yehonatan Steinberg's fall, there are two olive trees. One was planted not long ago. The other, ancient and embroidered, was specially brought here. On Memorial Day, more tender saplings were added to them. 'When I planted the first tree, I said: In the place where Yoni's life was cut short, we are planting life and deepening roots,' said Yiska. She grew up in Gush Katif in the former Gaza settlements. She met Yehonatan, from Givat Ze'ev, when he was a deputy platoon commander in the 931st battalion. 'A week after the wedding, Yoni went on an operation in Jenin for 18 days. Immediately after that, he spent another 21 days away from home,' she recalled. 'Today it sounds like nothing, but back then there was no war. This was our routine.' According to her, despite his intensive service Yoni was a devoted husband and father. 'He would do everything in the house: clean, wash. Everything you need. He would arrive very tired from the army, but that didn't stop him from having a full family Shabbat meal. 'Officers usually fall asleep after the Kiddush,' she added. He instilled the value of family in his subordinates as well. 'My wife told me that she wanted to go abroad with her family and that I should stay with the girl,' said Major Shahaf, the brigade logistics officer. 'I told her: 'I'm in the army, how will I be with the girl at home for five days?' I didn't know how to tell Yehonatan the brigade commander that I had to take time off. When I told him he said 'Of course you should let her travel. She needs it and she will appreciate you for it.'' On the morning of Simchat Torah, when Yehonatan was on his way south, the residents of Shomriya, where the family lived, were asked to stay in their homes due to the terrorist infiltration. 'I said, well, if this is my Simchat Torah, we'll make it happy,' Yiska pointed out. 'The little children danced with the Torah books and the older ones threw candy at them. I look at them and said, 'How sweet, I can't wait to tell Yoni what a Simchat Torah we had.' When the soldiers knocked on the door, around six p.m., we were in the middle of a Stratego game. Unitl then I was disconnected from what was happening in the country. I keep Shabbat, but this time Shabbat kept me from all the chaos and anxiety of that day.' The division commander stopped the vehicle and told me 'Take command of the Nahal Brigade.' Col. Zuckerman was at home in Moshav Nov in the Golan Heights on October 7. A month and a half earlier, he concluded his tenure as deputy commander of the 162nd Division (to which the Nahal Brigade belongs) and was about to be appointed commander of the Northern District of the Home Front Command. 'I was debating whether to go to the district or go down south,' he said. 'I decided to go south, to the brigade's headquarters in Nahal Sorek, and when I got there I joined the 162nd Division Commander Brigadier General Itzik Cohen. We both already knew that Yehonatan was not answering since the morning. When we arrived at the Kibbutz Beit Kama area, we spoke with Lt. Col. Yoni Dahan, who informed us that he had found Steinberg's body. The division commander stopped the vehicle and told me 'Take command of the Nahal Brigade.'' Dahan, who had finished his position as 932nd Battalion's commander two months earlier, was at the time a squad commander in the company commander course. 'I was at home, in Kfar Haroeh, and I went down south with a relative who is also a combat officer,' he recalled in a telephone interview. 'On the way, I called Malul, who replaced me as the battalion commander in Hebron, and he sent me reinforcements. We passed through the Nova music festival, fought with terrorists in Urim, and then we were asked to come to Ein HaShlosha to back up Golani. 'We drove through the fields and until we spotted terrorists on road 241. We unloaded the vehicles and opened fire on them. Then I see a kippah on the side of the road that looked familiar. I look and see Yehonatan Steinberg lying lifeless. I also saw Barnash's car there, but I didn't make the connection. Then an officer I knew called me and told me that he found Barnash dead and evacuated him. At Around 11 a.m. the division commander asked me to take command of the patrol force. I asked one of the officers to evacuate Yehonatan and drove to Kerem Shalom to join the patrol. Only when I got there did Zuckerman call me and inform me that he was now the brigade commander.' 'The earth was shaking' After several months of commanding the patrol, Dahan passed the reins to Lt. Col. Naor Bublil, who was appointed to be the patrol unit's commander before the war, and returned to his previous position. 'Yehonatan was my battalion commander and then my brigade commander. I experienced difficult things that day, but when I saw him lying there I felt like the earth was shaking. If they took Steinberg away from us, it's already a drastic event. Steinberg was always a compass for us, in his life and certainly after his death. Every time you are in a dilemma, you ask yourself what Steinberg would have done,' said Dahan. And this compass also guides the soldiers and junior officers. 'When I commanded the patrol unit, there were quite a few soldiers and commanders who were wounded and returned to combat,' he added. 'They told me - 'If our brigade commander gave his life, who are we to say anything?'' Col. Zuckerman knew Steinberg even before he was drafted into the IDF. 'Yehonatan was an instructor at the Bnei Akiva branch in Givat Ze'ev with my friends. In the army, he was always a position ahead of me. We studied together for our bachelor's degree in education with a teaching certificate. Yoni was tall and a splendid leader,' he said. Yiska finds solace in the beautiful years they had. 'The greater the pain, the greater the gratitude that we were blessed with such a meaningful life together and such wonderful and sweet children,' she said. 'I cry that it's over, and in the same breath, I feel the power of gratitude. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Yoni.'

IDF clears out Hamas terror base in northern Gaza hospital	Army says completed raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya, used as Hamas command center, seizing weapons, funds and documents tied to terror group, with 60 suspects arrested inside, including some linked to October 7 attacks The IDF announced Monday that it had completed a high-stakes raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza’s Jabaliya, which the army said served as a 'terror command center' for Hamas terrorists. The raid, led by the 162nd Division, uncovered weapons, terror funds and Hamas documents, with 60 terrorists reportedly apprehended within the hospital itself, including some linked to the October 7 attacks. These detainees were questioned on-site by Unit 504 intelligence operatives before being transferred to Israel for further investigation. During the raid, IDF commandos from the elite Shayetet 13 unit were captured on film searching hospital grounds and questioning an ambulance driver, who claimed that Hamas used hospital premises and ambulances to transport wounded fighters. 'Hamas operatives are everywhere—yards, gates, offices, schools, hospitals. They even use ambulances to move their fighters,' the driver reportedly said, expressing frustration at the situation. The military noted that the operation would continue in Jabaliya with two brigades remaining while a third unit would be rotated out. The IDF estimates a few hundred Hamas fighters are still present in the city, while around 600 terrorists surrendered in the broader campaign, including many who reportedly passed through new checkpoints around Jabaliya's refugee camp. The IDF’s larger effort across northern Gaza has also seen significant challenges, with Hamas employing extensive guerrilla tactics, explosive devices and fortified positions. The operation revealed what the military says is Hamas' reliance on explosive devices fashioned from unexploded Israeli ordnance scattered across the sector, which IDF forces neutralized via controlled detonations to prevent future use.

IDF clears out Hamas terror base in northern Gaza hospital	IDF forces on Monday concluded an operation at Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya, northern Gaza, a site the military identified as a Hamas hub, According to military sources, approximately 600 terrorists surrendered throughout the broader Jabaliya campaign and were transferred for questioning in Israel, with around 60 of those detained within the hospital, including one hospital staff member. The IDF estimates that only a few hundred Hamas fighters remain in Jabaliya, noting that the concentration of Hamas forces in the northern Gaza sector underpins the significance of the recent operations. The military reported initial difficulties in evacuating civilians from Jabaliya, but this hurdle has eased over the past week as more residents reportedly feel less constrained by Hamas.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syejqg6ejl	2024-10-28T03:23:04-07:00

Close call: IDF says investigating near-collision between F-16s a...	Fighter jet cleared for strike mission in Lebanon aborts takeoff at last moment upon spotting another aircraft on runway, veering sharply to avoid potential collision; 'It’s coming, it’s coming. Aborting takeoff,' pilot heard saying in recording A potentially catastrophic incident was narrowly averted over the weekend at northern Israel's Ramat David Air Base when an F-16 jet preparing for a strike mission in Lebanon cleared for takeoff nearly collided with another fighter jet crossing the same runway, the IDF reported Monday morning, adding that it was investigating what has led to the near-collision. According to a recording of the event, the F-16 pilot was forced to quickly adjust, averting a close call that raised immediate concerns about airfield safety protocols. Video footage reveals the pilot urgently relaying, 'It’s coming, it’s coming. Aborting takeoff.' The quick response kept the F-16 from advancing within a few hundred feet of the other plane on the runway. According to the military, the near-collision was caused by an erroneous takeoff clearance from the air traffic control tower with the pilot’s rapid response preventing what could have been a major accident. No damage or injuries were reported. Brig. Gen. Roi Bakshi, head of the IDF’s multi-domain division, was piloting the F-16 and reportedly asked the control tower, 'Did you see that plane on the runway?' The Israeli Air Force has since launched an in-depth investigation to understand the circumstances and ensure such an incident does not recur.

ICC in turmoil as top prosecutor's harassment scandal deepens, re...	Sources allege Karim Khan pressured female staffer for nearly a year to deny sexual harassment claims against him amid speculation arrest warrant requests for Israeli leaders might be cover for allegations International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan has allegedly pressured a female subordinate to deny sexual harassment claims against him, British newspaper The Guardian reported on Sunday. According to the report, Khan allegedly tried to engage in unwanted sexual relations with the employee and reportedly 'pressed his tongue' into the woman’s ear, as well as making other inappropriate advances. When she sought to file a complaint, Khan allegedly pressured her to submit a written statement retracting her allegations. The report also noted that the ICC swiftly dismissed the case after a brief investigation, despite having warned Khan to avoid contact with the woman. The case has prompted internal scrutiny and raised questions about the ICC’s handling of harassment complaints against senior figures. As speculation circulated, the newspaper clarified that Israel is not implicated in these emerging allegations, despite unrelated tensions over Khan’s recent calls for arrest warrants against Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The Guardian has previously been critical of Israel, having published claims of Israeli surveillance targeting ICC officials, though it did not link this recent investigation of Khan to his rulings on Israel-Palestine cases. The allegations were first reported by the Daily Mail, and according to The Guardian, based on interviews with 11 court officials and sources, there has been internal upheaval at the ICC as Khan faces these accusations. The ICC has yet to comment on any actions it may take regarding Khan’s role. At home, in the office, in hotel rooms The report alleges that Khan has harassed a lawyer under his supervision, with reports suggesting that the harassment spanned a year, from April 2023 to April 2024, escalating across various settings including Khan’s office, his home and on work trips. Sources indicated that the lawyer, in her 30s, attempted to distance herself from Khan, leading to adverse effects on her work. On one work trip to London, Khan allegedly held her hand and, over time, made repeated attempts to initiate physical contact, reportedly even engaging in inappropriate physical acts such as inserting his tongue in her ear, as shared by colleagues. Documents obtained by The Guardian suggest the lawyer feared filing an official complaint due to potential repercussions on her career and family. She also reportedly worried that critics of the ICC, such as Israel, might exploit her allegations. The ICC’s independent review mechanism advised Khan to avoid contact with the lawyer. However, the response to the allegations reportedly consisted of a rushed meeting with the victim in a hotel room in The Hague, where, according to the report, the investigation was closed within two days after the lawyer expressed distrust in the ICC’s handling of the review. The Guardian's investigation highlights persistent issues within the ICC’s internal processes, where skepticism about the independent review body has led some employees to avoid official complaints. Despite the ICC claiming the lawyer refused an external investigation, records show she agreed to meet with investigators again, contradicting claims that an outside review was offered. The incident has stirred controversy amid the ICC’s ongoing high-profile work, including Khan’s requests for arrest warrants for Israeli officials. The attempted silencing After the allegations surfaced, the court advised him to limit his contact with the employee, including avoiding evening or solo meetings and refraining from taking her on business trips. However, sources claim that, in defiance of these guidelines, Khan allegedly continued to interact with the employee, including discussing the allegations directly with her in private meetings and phone calls. An associate in Khan’s office reportedly pressured the employee to write a letter retracting her claims, emphasizing Khan’s concern about the potential political fallout if the allegations were made public. The Guardian further reports that Khan and his associate persistently encouraged the employee to retract her claims in writing between May and September, suggesting this would allow a return to 'normalcy' in their professional relationship. The employee declined to retract the allegations, yet also refrained from filing a formal complaint, though sources believe Khan's attempts to suppress the accusations may have ultimately led to a complaint being filed regardless. The Israel link and the next step Khan, 54, has firmly denied the allegations, dismissing them as a possible 'smear campaign' by court opponents. While Khan has not directly accused Israel, he has insinuated that critics of the ICC may be exploiting these claims. However, The Guardian noted that there is no evidence linking Israel to the allegations against Khan. The investigation reported that senior officials at the ICC are increasingly concerned about the court's internal handling of the allegations. Additionally, the court's staff union has called for an independent probe, managed externally to ensure impartiality. Meanwhile, the complainant is reportedly in communication with the Assembly of States Parties (ASP)—the ICC's oversight body—although no formal investigation has been launched. Sources within the ICC told The Guardian that while they worry the scandal could be politically exploited by ICC critics, including Israel, they emphasized that the arrest warrant requests against Netanyahu and Gallant were in motion before Khan was made aware of the allegations. Khan’s legal team has also denied claims that he or his associates pressured the complainant to retract her allegations, saying no such requests were made on his behalf. The ASP’s response and potential action in the matter will determine Khan’s future as ICC prosecutor, though the organization has yet to announce any formal inquiry.

Satellite images show extent of Israeli strike at 2 Iranian bases	Additional satellite images from Parchin base, previously linked to nuclear development, reveal destroyed building and damage to others; significant damage also visible at Khojir production site An Israeli strike on Iran damaged facilities at two military bases southeast of Tehran, previously linked by experts to Iran's former nuclear weapons program and its ballistic missile efforts, according to satellite images analyzed on Sunday. Some damaged structures were at Iran’s Parchin military base, where the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) suspects high-explosive tests connected to nuclear weapons were conducted in the past. Iran maintains its nuclear program is peaceful, though the IAEA and Western intelligence agencies say Tehran had an active weapons program until 2003. Further damage was visible at the nearby Khojir military base, believed by analysts to house an underground tunnel network and missile production facilities. Iran’s military has not acknowledged damage at either Khojir or Parchin from Israel’s attack early Saturday, though it has said the assault killed four Iranian soldiers working in the country’s air defense systems. Iran announced Sunday a civilian also had been killed, but provided no details. Satellite images reveal damage to facilities used for combining solid fuel for missiles. Researcher David Albright noted that images from Parchin show damage to three buildings, including two used for integrating solid fuel into ballistic missiles. Another researcher stated that Planet Labs satellite photos from Parchin indicate Israel destroyed three buildings used for ballistic missile production with solid fuel, along with a warehouse. Images from Khojir show two similar buildings were also destroyed. It remains unclear how many sites in total were targeted in the Israeli attack. There have been no images of damage so far released by Iran’s military. Iranian officials have identified affected areas as being in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces. Burned fields could be seen in satellite images from Planet Labs PBC around Iran’s Tange Bijar natural gas production site in Ilam province on Saturday, though it wasn’t immediately clear if it was related to the attack. Ilam province sits on the Iran-Iraq border in western Iran.

Israel inks $500 million defense deal for expanded laser intercep...	This deal heralds a new era—the era of laser defense,' Defense Ministry says after signing massive deal; first operational deployment of ground-based laser system expected next year The Defense Ministry announced Monday a major deal worth approximately NIS 2 billion (around $500 million) to boost its acquisition of advanced Iron Beam laser interception systems. Defense Ministry Director-General Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir, who signed the agreement Sunday, said, 'This deal heralds a new era—the era of laser defense,' adding that the first operational capability of the ground-based laser system is expected to be deployed within the next year. The multi-billion-shekel agreement, reached between the Directorate of Defense Research and Development (DDR&D) and primary contractors Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Elbit Systems, marks a significant increase in production pace to ensure timely, high-volume delivery of laser units. The Iron Beam system, designed to intercept various aerial threats such as rockets, mortar shells, drones and cruise missiles, has demonstrated its capabilities in recent trials and is set to join Israel’s multi-tiered defense network as a cost-effective addition to the Iron Dome. 'Since the outbreak of the war, the Defense Ministry has signed hundreds of procurement orders worth billions to bolster Israeli-manufactured defense capabilities and ensure Israel’s self-reliance,' said Zamir. The ministry’s statement noted that the integration of Iron Beam will significantly enhance Israel's defensive capacity against current and future threats at a fraction of conventional interception costs. 'Global superiority' 'The Iron Beam is yet another testament to the professionalism, creativity and innovative prowess of our defense industries, supported by partnerships between defense companies and startups,' DDR&D head Brig. Gen. (res.) Dr. Danny Gold said. He noted that Israel's capability to develop and deploy advanced laser interception technology on the battlefield is a reflection of both technical mastery and effective project management. Rafael CEO Yoav Turgeman highlighted that after years of research, the Iron Beam laser system—the first of its kind worldwide—is set for deployment. 'Rafael is proud to lead the development of this high-powered, versatile laser interception system. Following a series of rigorous tests, the Iron Beam will soon reach operational maturity,' Turgeman said. Elbit President and CEO Bezhalel Machlis (Butzi) Machlis called the development 'a significant leap forward in defense against diverse threats.' Elbit, known as Israel's 'laser powerhouse,' collaborated closely on Iron Beam’s development. 'Our teams at Elbit have played a critical role in advancing this groundbreaking defense capability, which we believe will set a new standard in strategic defense for Israel,' Machlis said.

Mother recounts how she saved her infant as Hamas terrorists set ...	Amy Laban, a member of Kibbutz Nirim, recalls how she, her husband Uriel, their newborn son Kai and her mother Deborah huddled in the safe room for 6 hours, opening and closing the window to get some fresh air until IDF troops arrived to rescue them Nothing prepared 30-year-old Amy Laban, a Kibbutz Nirim member and teacher in the Eshkol Regional Council, and her husband, Uriel—a capoeira instructor and hydrotherapist—for the traumatic turn their parental leave would take. Just 10 days before the October 7 Hamas terror attack they welcomed their first son, Kai. The day before, they celebrated Simchat Torah in a decorated sukkah with their kibbutz community. The joy was threefold—they celebrated the holiday, Kai’s circumcision, and their official acceptance into Kibbutz Nirim, where Uriel had grown up after emigrating from Argentina at age 10. Amy's mother, 60-year-old Deborah Mintz from Eilat, had come to celebrate and stayed overnight. 'We woke up to rocket sirens, Amy recalled. 'I called my mom, and we rushed to the safe room. We thought it would be like usual—a few rockets, then we’d have breakfast and move on. But the rockets didn’t stop, and we realized something was different. After an hour, we started hearing gunfire and people shouting in Arabic around the kibbutz. We didn’t understand much, but my husband and I locked the safe room door and shut the metal window tight, waiting for whatever came next.' 'At 8:30 am, I heard them break into our house. We couldn’t see anything because they’d cut the power. My husband and I held the safe room door handle tightly, while my mom held our 10-day-old baby, trying to quiet him by gently putting a finger in his mouth. They couldn’t break in—they only managed to chip a small slit in the door. That’s when they set the house on fire.' 'We were in the safe room, with my mother and our 10-day-old, as the house burned around us. Smoke and soot filled the air for six hours. I got our dog into the room, but my mom’s smaller dog, scared, hid under the couch outside. When they set the house on fire, we heard him crying. We believe he was burned. They even torched our cars to make sure we had nothing left. We begged for rescue on WhatsApp. It was terrifying, but we each focused on a task. After the fire started, I stayed by the door while my husband opened the window intermittently to release the smoke. My mom held the baby.' 'I nursed Kai whenever he cried. When we thought things were quiet outside, we’d open the window and let him get some air. Whenever a terrorist passed by, we’d quickly pull him in, put him on the bed, shut the window, and crouch down. They even shot at the metal window, but thankfully, the glass held. For six hours, we played a game of opening and closing the window just to breathe until they finally rescued us. Our kibbutz’s amazing response team managed to neutralize a few terrorists with the help of four brave members until the army arrived around 2:30 pm.' 'They broke down the shutters and got us out, took us to a shelter, and guarded us outside. They found an oxygen tank to share before we headed to the hospital. Since the ambulance couldn’t reach us, two incredible soldiers, unarmed, took the risk and drove us to Soroka Medical Center. Kai was hospitalized for three days. Thankfully, all his tests came back normal. My husband and I alternated in the ER with eye irritations and smoke inhalation; we’re all still coughing. A few days later, we managed to relocate with the kibbutz to Eilat, where my mom lives.'

Chicago police investigate shooting of Jewish man en route to syn...	Gunman exchanges fire with police, reportedly shouting ‘Allahu Akbar’ during confrontation; local Jewish community expresses frustration, criticizing law enforcement for not acknowledging religious identity of victim in initial reports A 39-year-old Jewish man was shot in the back while walking to a synagogue in Chicago’s West Rogers Park neighborhood on Saturday morning, in what some community members allege may be a hate-driven attack. The incident, reported by Yeshiva World News, occurred around 9:35 a.m. in an area with a significant Orthodox Jewish population. Witnesses recounted that the shooter, reportedly a 23-year-old man, yelled 'Allahu Akbar' as he exchanged fire with responding officers. The suspect initially fled but returned to a nearby alley about 20 minutes later, where he reportedly fired at police and emergency responders, striking an ambulance during the exchange. Police noted that the suspect fired from multiple locations, prompting a prolonged confrontation that ended when officers shot him multiple times, leaving him in critical condition at St. Francis Hospital. The victim was treated at a local hospital for a shoulder wound and has since been discharged. Chicago police have not publicly addressed speculation about the attack’s potential antisemitic motive, although local Jewish leaders have voiced frustration over the absence of statements acknowledging the victim's background. Police recovered the weapon used in the shooting and have refrained from commenting on an alleged motive, while local Jewish groups continue to press for answers and assurances regarding the safety of their community.

‘We’re negotiating with ourselves’: Israeli officials pessimistic...	In first summit since Sinwar’s death, Israel remains skeptical of Egypt's proposal, while officials stress any cease-fire requires Hezbollah and Iran to pressure Hamas toward negotiations Mossad Director David Barnea began talks in Doha on Sunday with CIA Director Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed Al Thani in an effort to renew negotiations on possible frameworks for a deal to secure the release of 101 hostages held by Hamas. This marks the first high-level meeting between the parties in two months and the first since the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The primary goal of this meeting is to advance a new plan that takes into account recent proposals brought forward by the negotiating teams. Officials have indicated that a broader, four-party summit, potentially involving Egypt and Hamas representatives, could take place in the coming days to advance these efforts. Positive developments for Israel in Gaza and Lebanon are seen as creating significant momentum for returning to intensive negotiations. The Egyptian proposal Meanwhile, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi publicly presented Cairo’s proposal, which involves a 48-hour cease-fire in exchange for the release of four hostages in return for some Palestinian prisoners. The proposal, aimed at 'moving the situation forward,' would allow for a 10-day negotiation period to discuss terms for a long-term cease-fire. According to sources cited by Al Arabiya, Hamas has welcomed Egypt’s proposal but expressed reservations about the lack of Israeli guarantees. Hamas reportedly opposes a cease-fire without a full Israeli withdrawal from northern Gaza and the Netzarim and Philadelphi corridors. 'Our demands are clear and transparent, and an agreement is within reach if [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu commits to the terms discussed,' Hamas official Hossam Badran told Al Jazeera. ‘We’re negotiating with ourselves’ Israeli officials expressed skepticism about any potential breakthroughs in negotiations with Hamas, citing the upcoming U.S. presidential election on November 5 as a significant factor likely to delay progress. Officials in Jerusalem remain unconvinced of the viability of a proposal from Egypt’s intelligence chief, Hasan Rashad, according to sources familiar with the discussions. 'It’s been like this since January,' said an official close to the talks. 'We’re negotiating with ourselves, or at best with intermediaries. At no point has there been a real negotiation with Hamas. They’ve set a demand and haven’t moved an inch from it: a complete end to the fighting and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and that’s not happening.' This pessimism is rooted in a widespread belief in Israel that Hamas will settle for nothing less than a full withdrawal from Gaza, including from the Philadelphi Corridor and the Rafah crossing. Netanyahu is seen as unlikely to agree to such terms, fearing it could destabilize his coalition due to opposition from ministers like Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. Still, Mossad Director Barnea has been developing a new negotiation framework over the past three weeks. On Thursday, Barnea met with Rashad in Cairo to update him on the plan, which will likely incorporate elements of both the Egyptian proposal and other options. Barnea remains hopeful that the intimate setting of Doha could restart direct negotiations for a hostage deal. The discussions in Doha are also expected to touch on the Lebanese front. According to a source quoted by The Wall Street Journal, Barnea does not believe Israel should agree to a cease-fire in Lebanon unless Hezbollah and Iran pressure Hamas to release the hostages in Gaza. Separately, Lebanese network LBCI cited a diplomatic source who said, 'The meeting in Doha has opened a door. There’s been slight progress on Gaza, and there’s genuine interest in a prisoner exchange between Hamas and Israel.' The diplomatic source added that Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri had informed Qatar and Egypt that Hezbollah is willing to separate the fronts and accept UN Resolution 1701 as part of a combined package, meaning the Lebanon issue will be included in the ongoing negotiations. A Qatari-Egyptian meeting with Hamas is expected, and a high-ranking Qatari security envoy is set to visit Beirut to address Lebanon’s concerns and demands. In response, Berri’s office said, 'The recent media reports on Speaker Berri’s remarks regarding the negotiations are inaccurate.'

Victim of suspected Glilot attack named as Betzalel Carmi	Retired educator, 72, survived by his Holocaust survivor parents, Abraham and Rivka, his four children—Uri, Anat, Yuval and Shlomit—and his grandchildren The man killed in a suspected ramming attack in Glilot on Sunday has been identified as Bezalel Carmi, 72, a father of four from Rishon Lezion. Police have not yet determined if the incident was an accident or an attack. Hundreds gathered for Carmi’s funeral at the Gordon Cemetery in his hometown. Rishon Lezion Mayor Raz Kinstlich wrote: 'Bezalel leaves behind two Holocaust survivor parents, Abraham and Rivka, along with four children—Uri, Anat, Yuval and Shlomit—and grandchildren. A psychologist by profession, Bezalel was an educator with the Youth Aliyah movement, an organization dedicated to education, Aliyah and Zionism. Bezalel’s family has deep roots in the city, where he raised and taught generations of people. 'During a tour with a group of retirees in the Glilot area, he was struck by a truck as he stepped off a bus. It’s still unclear if this was an attack or an accident, but it was a tragic and devastating event. Bezalel's life and story were cut short in an instant. Rishon Lezion shares in the family’s profound grief and mourns his passing.' The driver, identified as Rami Nasrallah from the Arab town of Qalansawe, reportedly had about 70 previous traffic violations. His body was sent to Tel Aviv’s National Center of Forensic Medicine for an autopsy to determine if a medical event, such as a heart attack, might have contributed to the incident. Nasrallah’s family has denied any terrorist motives, claiming he had a heart condition and had recently undergone open-heart surgery. 'It was not an attack,' said his brother, Mahmoud Nasrallah. 'My brother has health issues and wouldn’t do such a thing. He is a simple man just trying to earn a living and go home. He has no connection to anything like that, either closely or distantly.'

Battered and cornered: How Hamas clings on after major losses	Since Oct. 27, 2023, the IDF has swept through Gaza to dismantle Hamas and retrieve hostages; a year on, Hamas’ tunnel network and arsenal are mostly destroyed and 117 hostages have returned; however, Hamas persists in the military's dead zones Hamas’ deadly surprise attack, which catalyzed the now more-than-year-long war, proved that the perennial Gaza problem won’t resolve itself. In a single strike, the terrorist organization shattered the previous notion that maintaining its rule in Gaza, along with cash infusions into the Palestinian enclave, could serve as a sufficient deterrent or smokescreen. Hamas terrorists brutally attacked Israeli territory in what many see as one of Israel’s worst security, political and intelligence failures. Yet, even more than a year after the massacre, the Security Cabinet has not defined a strategic policy for Gaza’s future. Questions remain unresolved about what should take shape 'the day after'—whether weakened Hamas control, Palestinian Authority governance, moderate Arab states’ involvement or even Jewish settlement—all possibilities that have yet to be formally decided. The focus has largely shifted to distant fronts in Lebanon and Iran, leaving Gaza’s fate uncertain. Nonetheless, there is consensus on one point: the IDF must maintain operational freedom in Gaza to prevent the rebuilding of terrorist organizations’ power, a priority that contrasts starkly with the approach before October 7. This is the situation on the one-year anniversary of the ground offensive in Gaza. Fighting in circles On October 7, faced with an unprecedented assault, Israel saw no alternative but to initiate a full-scale war with two core objectives: dismantling Hamas' military and governance capabilities and securing the return of hostages taken during the attack. In response, the Israeli Air Force launched extensive airstrikes across Gaza, which began after several hours when forces were unable to counter the onslaught effectively. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of reservists reported for duty, with an unprecedented mobilization rate, preparing for action across multiple fronts. This marked the initial phase of operations in Gaza, during which a ground offensive was delayed for nearly three weeks as plans were finalized and political leaders evaluated potential consequences. After initial hesitations, Israel entered Gaza on October 27, aiming to exert military pressure on Hamas to secure the hostages' release and ultimately weaken the organization’s grip on Gaza. However, it soon became clear that achieving the second objective could drag on indefinitely. Following a brief month of ground operations, fighting paused for a week-long hostage exchange during which Hamas released 80 women and children. Israel resumed its offensive thereafter, pushing into Khan Younis and later, under renewed diplomatic pressures, advancing into Rafah as well. The guiding belief—'military pressure would coerce Hamas into a hostage deal'—proved ineffective. Currently, though a formal cease-fire was not declared, combat operations in much of Gaza have concluded without Israel fully achieving its strategic goals. This final phase unfolded unevenly; by early 2024, Israel had ceased its ground offensive in 70% of Gaza's territory, and by August, 20% more—including Rafah—was similarly quiet. In the remaining areas, the presence of hostages led to a halt in direct military action, especially following the execution of six hostages in a Rafah tunnel. The IDF is currently concentrated along the Philadelphi Corridor and in the surrounding neighborhoods, as well as along the Netzarim Corridor, which divides northern Gaza from the rest of the territory. From these key positions, forces conduct targeted raids, including those in Jabaliya and Beit Lahia. The IDF has prepared extensively for this prolonged deployment, establishing outposts along the Netzarim Corridor and constructing operational roads in both Netzarim and the Philadelphi Corridor, where forces are able to navigate even with light, unarmored vehicles. IDF officers note that fighting in Gaza has become cyclical. The buildings where soldiers are now engaging in Jabaliya and its refugee camp are the same areas where the 98th Division previously operated and cleared in May, and the 162nd Division did so again during the height of the ground offensive last November and December. In these zones, Hamas has managed to reactivate some of its tunnels that were previously destroyed by the IDF and has rigged many areas with explosives, some of which are reportedly made from unexploded IDF munitions left on the battlefield in recent months. Effectively, Hamas has reestablished its presence within these zones, using the cover of the local population. In Rafah, the IDF continues to target sites where Hamas is attempting to re-operate or where it still retains certain capabilities, especially underground assets. However, these operations are primarily localized, carried out at the battalion and brigade levels, and are focused on securing and maintaining control of the nearby Philadelphi Corridor. As time passes, the IDF increasingly acknowledges that a full withdrawal from Gaza’s Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors, where Israeli forces maintain a continuous presence, remains unlikely in the near future. As a result, reserve brigades are being informed of continued deployment rotations in these areas through 2025. 'Hamas rule won’t collapse unless an alternative governance structure is established,' military officials say. Meanwhile, the government has delayed settling on a clear long-term strategy, instead considering local solutions with uncertain effectiveness, such as distributing aid to Gaza residents through American contractors. This approach, say officials, effectively leaves Hamas in power, weakened but still present. Without an official directive for a 'post-Hamas' Gaza, the military cannot plan effectively beyond conducting limited, targeted operations. The IDF has not operated across most of Gaza's territory for over six months. In large cities such as Khan Younis, signs of Hamas' resurgence are apparent, even more so than in northern Gaza. Israel’s 'maintenance tax' to the U.S. for humanitarian supplies—fuel, electricity and medicine—often ends up in the hands of Hamas or local militias, underscoring the instability in areas without Hamas' control. Ironically, some residents are reported to prefer the group’s return for the relative order it once imposed, as street safety has deteriorated in its absence. As a military force, Hamas has sustained significant losses. Estimates indicate that 80-90% of its mid- to long-range rocket stockpile has been destroyed, and roughly 15,000-20,000 Hamas fighters have been killed or incapacitated out of an original 30,000, though some consider these figures high. Despite this, Hamas continues to recruit, while thousands of additional fighters come from other factions, such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The IDF estimates that large portions of Hamas’ tunnel network remain, particularly as disconnected local structures rather than the integrated 'metro network.' Many are located in areas where the IDF has refrained from operating in, such as central Gaza towns, due to fears that these sites may be holding hostages. ‘Force is not the answer to everything’ On October 7, Palestinian terror groups kidnapped 251 people, both alive and deceased; of these, 117 have been returned—most through negotiations—along with the bodies of 37. Yet, 97 remain captive, among them long-held detainees Hadar Goldin, Oron Shaul, Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed. Current estimates indicate roughly 50 captives remain alive, surviving in harsh conditions. Talks for their release resumed on Sunday, with a summit in Qatar following prior attempts that failed over Hamas’ demand to end the war and Israel’s insistence on maintaining a military presence in Gaza. However, a new dilemma complicates this round: who holds decision-making power on the other side? Following the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, high-ranking commanders remain in Gaza, including Rafah brigade commander Muhammad Shabana, northern Gaza’s Az al-Din al-Haddad, and Sinwar’s brother Muhammad. Yet, some hostages are held by other groups, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad and rogue factions. Thus, while Sinwar’s elimination may have created new negotiating opportunities, it also presents new complexities. 'Not every objective can be achieved solely through military action,' Defense Minister Yoav Gallant emphasized in his address at the state memorial ceremony for war casualties at Mount Herzl, facing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'Force is not the answer to everything. To fulfill our moral duty—to bring the captives home—we may need to make painful compromises. We must do this for them, for their families, for the soldiers who fell for this cause, for the legacy of the IDF and for our Jewish and national ethos. 'This is our responsibility—my responsibility as defense minister, just as it was on the morning of October 7, throughout the entire year of war, encompassing both achievements and failures, the heavy costs, and the national challenges we are committed to addressing.' In a letter to the Cabinet, Gallant noted that the war’s goals require a strategic shift. A well-known point of contention is that the prime minister is unwilling to make the same concessions as the defense minister to secure the release of Israelis still held captive— a disagreement that nearly cost Gallant his position. In recent weeks, both sides have even discussed a 'small deal,' a step that could pave the way for a broader agreement, one that many families continue to hope for. Against this backdrop, Osnat Sharabi Matalon, whose brothers Yossi Sharabi and Eli Sharabi remain captive in Gaza, described the emotions felt by families amid renewed talks following prior dashed hopes. 'We’ve learned not to hope,' she said. 'We’re always hopeful for negotiations and an agreement to bring back all the hostages, and we’ll keep rising each day with that hope in our hearts. But we’ve also learned not to listen to the noise around us. Until I see Eli, until I see the hostages in a Red Cross vehicle, I won’t believe it’s real.' Osnat added that the last sign of life from her brother Eli arrived many months ago but explained that 'it doesn’t mean much. He’s in a war zone. We’re very worried. The last six hostages were alive just moments before they were killed, so proof of life doesn’t tell us anything, even if there’s some tiny piece of information. Just bring them back.' Her brother Yossi has been confirmed to have been killed in captivity. 'I wish decision-makers could walk in our shoes,' she added. 'I wish they could feel what it means. Our loved ones are there. If it were their loved ones, they’d be talking differently; I’m sure of it. If there’s a way to save someone who is still down there in those tunnels, without food, air or water, and in the worst physical and mental condition, then they must do everything possible. Don’t forget why we went to war and why we’re still at war.' Dedicated heroes amid the high costs of war Since October 7, the war has claimed the lives of 771 Israeli soldiers, including 360 who fell in Gaza. The ground offensive across the Gaza Strip has also left 2,368 soldiers wounded, with 452 seriously injured, 726 sustaining moderate injuries and 1,190 with minor injuries. 'He talked about the fact that there was a real price to be paid within this war but that they were willing to pay it,' said Marcy and Howard Oster, the parents of Sergeant First Class (res.) Amichai Yisrael Yehoshua Oster who was killed on January 1 by an explosive device on the outskirts of the Daraj Tuffah sector in northern Gaza. When the war broke out, he had been in the United States but quickly returned to Israel. 'He felt that he needed to be fighting for his country. He felt he needed to be part of it.' His mother shared a poignant memory: 'A couple of weeks before he fell, we had this conversation, where I told him that I felt terrible that he was fighting this war, that we brought him here. We knew he would have to serve in the army. And he looked at me and said, 'what makes you think that if we hadn't made Aliyah, I wouldn't be here fighting anyway?' And that has given me a lot of comfort over the last few months.' Gideon Abbas, the brother of Maj. Jamal Abbas who fell on November 18 in Sheikh Ajlin in northern Gaza, described his brother as one of the first forces to enter the hostile territory. 'This was always his way,' he said. 'Even as a child during the Second Lebanon War, he wouldn’t go to the shelter. He’d say, ‘If everyone is fighting, we’re with them.’ The longing for him, the pain—it’s indescribable. You think life goes on, but the emptiness remains the same, and you try to build around it, which isn’t easy.' Gideon noted that, on October 7, Jamal 'rushed forward, feeling that this was his moment.' He added that he believes the bravery of soldiers like his brother deserves more recognition in Israeli society. 'People did things you only see in movies. Look at Yom Kippur War; what we accomplished was remarkable, yet all people remember is the failure. We want them to remember the courage, to know there’s a generation here that hasn’t forgotten the essence of Israel, the reason it was established, and ran into the fire for the hope that we could live better.' Abbas also referenced the Nation-State Law, which alienated many of Israel's minorities, including the Druze community, and a recent tense meeting with Interior Minister Moshe Arbel, saying, 'We’re not mercenaries, here just to die for the state. That’s not how it works. There’s talk of creating separate legislation for the Druze community, and my grandfather was outraged by this. Twelve of our best Druze sons have fallen in this war alone, leaving aside the 432 who’ve fallen over the years—and even more if we count before Israel’s establishment. The feeling of second-class status isn’t felt in the streets; Israeli society embraces us, and everyone shares the burden. But that’s not how the state treats us. We want equality for the Druze, without being separated from the Jewish people.'

Smotrich: 'Palestinians are part of Iran's axis of evil'	Finance minister calls for US and Western allies to seize 'rare opportunity' to remove Iranian regime and its proxies and eliminate Tehran's nuclear program Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on Sunday that the 'Palestinians are part of the axis of evil,' urging the next U.S. administration, along with Western allies, to topple the mullah regime in Iran. Smotrich added that 'Iran's nuclear program, which threatens the State of Israel and the entire Western world must be terminated.' Speaking at a local conference, Smotrich declared that 'once in several generations, a rare opportunity arises to reshape history, alter global power structures and redefine the future. In the near future, we will face crucial decisions that could lead to a new, right Middle East.' Smotrich outlined two main pillars supporting this vision: a shift in Israeli and international perspectives and dismantling the axis of evil. 'The awakening in Israel and globally is a historic opportunity we must not miss to establish a new Middle East, where west of the Jordan River there exists one and only national definition—the state of the Jewish people,' Smotrich said. 'The world has witnessed the horror and brutality that emerged from Gaza, and, like Israeli society, it now understands that if there is an Iranian axis of evil and a bloc of moderate states signing the Abraham Accords, the Palestinians are deeply embedded within Iran's axis of evil.' 'The vast majority of Gaza’s residents supported Hamas and its massacre, as did the Palestinian Authority and much of the Arab public in the West Bank,' he added. 'Those who back such acts and have not condemned them to this day are on the wrong side of history. They are deeply part of the Iranian axis of evil, ‘the problem,’ and cannot be part of the solution.' Smotrich falsely claimed that the PLO Executive Committee convened to hold a memorial for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Instead, Palestinian officials held a memorial for all those killed in Gaza. 'The axis of evil has been metastasizing for many years and poses a threat not only to Israel but to the entire Western world,' he said. 'We are eliminating Hamas, defeating Hezbollah, destabilizing the Iranian regime and acting beyond that. In one month, Israel has taken out Sinwar, Nasrallah and top terrorist figures, some of whom the U.S. has been pursuing for years. We can and must continue to join forces, work to bring down the Iranian mullah regime, and dismantle their nuclear program, which threatens global peace.'

Iran says informed of Israeli attack hours in advance	Iranian FM claims messages exchanged with 'various parties' ahead of upcoming air raid; Netanyahu's office denies claims Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi claimed Sunday that Iran had been informed by 'various parties' in advance of Israel's attack over the weekend, according to Iranian media. Araghchi indicated that hours before the Israeli strikes, messages were exchanged with undisclosed parties, prompting unspecified actions by Tehran. In a letter to the UN Security Council, Araghchi condemned Israel’s actions as a 'serious threat to international peace' and called for an urgent session. He asserted that Iran reserves its right to a 'legal and legitimate response' per international law and the UN Charter. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian echoed this stance, saying, 'We do not seek war, but we will defend our nation's rights,' and pledged a response to what he called the 'aggression of the Zionist regime.' Earlier on Sunday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said that Israel’s attack against Iran 'should neither be exaggerated nor minimized.' Meanwhile, Ebrahim Azizi, head of the Iranian parliament’s national security committee, told Qatar’s The New Arab newspaper that Iran’s response would be 'smart,' 'timely,' and 'deterrent' to ensure the 'Americans and Zionists regret these actions.' Reports indicate mixed reactions to the advance notifications: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office denied having sent any such message to Iran regarding the attack’s timing or targets. However, The Wall Street Journal reported that Arab and European countries relayed warnings to Iran beforehand. Iranian officials also told The New York Times that Israel’s targeting of air defense systems, specifically the S-300s supplied by Russia, has raised significant concerns for Iran, as critical energy and economic sites may now be more vulnerable to future attacks. Following these developments, the Security Cabinet convened late Sunday to discuss the potential for Iranian retaliation and to review the ongoing hostage negotiations.

THAAD deployment paved way for Israeli retaliatory airstrikes on ...	Military experts suggest Israel 'broke its fear barrier,' potentially leading to future strikes on Iranian nuclear sites Just days after the US bolstered Israeli air defense by deploying a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery and 100 soldiers, Israel on Saturday carried out a large retaliatory strike on Iran. An estimated 100 Israeli aircraft participated in the hourslong operation over Iran's night skies. The Israeli military stated that it had 'conducted targeted and precise strikes on military targets in Iran—thwarting immediate threats.' Military sites in Tehran, in the heart of Iranian territory, were among those struck. 'This was a game changer, a transition from the shadow war to a new level of the game which is now out in the open,' Sharona Shir Zablodovsky, an expert on public policy and national security at the Dvorah Forum said. 'Israel demonstrated the ability to attack several sites simultaneously, showing it has precise intelligence.' Israel’s military said the strike targeted missile manufacturing facilities used by Iran in attacks over the past year. Iranian surface-to-air missiles and 'aerial capabilities that were intended to restrict Israel’s aerial freedom of operation in Iran' were also targeted 'Israel now has broader aerial freedom of operation in Iran,' the statement continued. Danny Citrinowicz, a research fellow at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies’ Iran Program, said the THAAD deployment signaled US trust that Israel would not act against American interests. 'This was a meaningful strategic and operative move that was a message to both Iran and Israel,' Citrinowicz told The Media Line. 'It was a fruitful American effort to coerce Israel into operating only against military targets but also sent a message to Iran that the US will back Israel, especially in defending it.' He described the strike as 'a historical event that completely changed the relationship between Iran and Israel.' 'The attack reflected an Israeli will to balance the deterrence equation vis-à-vis Iran, signaling that massive rocket fire toward Israel cannot go unanswered, but without leading to a wider escalation, while also taking into consideration the will of the American administration to not escalate before the US elections,' he said. For more than a year, Israel has been entangled in a multifront war with Iranian-backed groups in Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen, and other areas. This year marked the first time Iran and Israel exchanged direct blows after years of engaging in a shadow war. Prior to Saturday, the latest direct attack occurred last month when Iran fired at least 180 ballistic missiles toward Israel, most of which were intercepted before reaching their targets. Last weekend, a drone launched by Hezbollah, Iran’s Lebanese proxy, targeted the private residence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. That incident escalated Israel’s threats of retaliation against Iran, which materialized over the weekend. 'Israel had to respond to an attack by a country which shares no border with Israel and threatens its existence,' Shir Zablodovsky said. 'The defense echelon is well aware of Iran’s ability to take a major toll on Israel.' Now the region once again awaits Iran’s decision on whether to respond, in what has become an increasingly violent tit-for-tat. On Sunday, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei posted on the X social media platform that the damage from the Israeli strike 'should neither be exaggerated nor minimized.' His post did not make clear whether Iran intends to retaliate. Shir Zablodovsky said that Khamenei would not give up easily on his '40-year-old project to destroy Israel.' The full extent of the Israeli strike and the damage exacted remains unclear. Media reports quoting unnamed Israeli, American, and Iranian officials indicate that Iran’s ability to manufacture long-range ballistic missiles and drones has been crippled. Other reports allege that Iranian air defense capabilities have been significantly hit. Online satellite imagery shows apparent damage to a suspected nuclear site in Parchin and a missile production facility in Khojir. Israel’s yearlong war began after Hamas, the armed group ruling the Gaza Strip, carried out a surprise offensive on Israel’s southern border. The conflict soon expanded, with Hezbollah in Lebanon firing rockets and drones toward northern Israel. The northern front mostly simmered below the surface until this summer, when Israel pivoted the main focus of the war to Lebanon. After numerous attacks on Hezbollah, including the assassination of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, the terror organization is scrambling to recuperate with the help of Iran. For decades, Iran has funded and armed Hezbollah as a cornerstone of its regional strategy. With Iran and Israel more than 1,000 miles apart, the presence of Hezbollah on Israel’s border helped Iran deter Israel from an attack. That strategy of deterrence now seems to have failed. 'The Iranians underestimated how much the weakening of Hezbollah gives Israel freedom to attack on Iranian soil,' Citrinowicz said. Israel is believed to have previously contemplated a preemptive strike against Iran’s nuclear program, but such an attack has not been carried out, perhaps due to numerous logistical challenges. These include the large distance between the two countries, the need for Israeli jets to fly over and refuel in enemy territory, and the requirement for sophisticated, heavy bombs capable of penetrating underground nuclear targets. Additionally, Israel was deterred by concerns that Hezbollah, one of the world's strongest terrorist organizations, would unleash its capabilities on Israel at Tehran's behest. So far, Hezbollah attacks have not devastated Israel as security experts had feared. However, the group has not been a paper tiger, continuing to fire dozens of rockets and drones at Israel daily. Over the weekend, two Israeli citizens were killed by a rocket fired at an Arab-Israeli village near the border. On Sunday morning, a Hezbollah drone hit an aviation plant in northern Israel. Hours later, Hezbollah fired over 75 projectiles in a single barrage toward the same area, signaling it was still ready to fight. 'Hezbollah should not be eulogized just yet,' Shir Zablodovsky said. 'They still have military power, which they prefer to use incrementally by exhausting Israel and its society.' Iran may still call on Hezbollah to strike back at Israel if the Islamic Republic chooses to respond to Saturday’s attack through a proxy. Before settling on the military sites targeted in this strike, Israel is believed to have considered targeting Iranian nuclear sites or oil production facilities. Netanyahu was under significant American pressure to scale down the operation to avoid causing a major escalation just days before the US presidential election. 'There is no doubt that the election had a direct effect on Israel's decision,' Shir Zablodovsky said. 'It did not strike where it wanted to strike. Israel would have wanted to target major infrastructure but did not. Had it targeted Iran’s oil depots, prices would have skyrocketed, and this would have had an effect on the vote in the US, as the economy is the main issue Americans vote on.' In Israel, the strike is being portrayed as a success with potentially widespread implications for the direction of the war. 'If in the past, there was a low probability that Israel would attack nuclear facilities without American backing, this has now changed,' Citrinowicz said. 'Looking into the future, with Hezbollah now weakened and Israelis’ ability to operate freely in Iranian airspace, as Iran progresses with its nuclear program, this option can no longer be ruled out. Israel broke its fear barrier with this attack.' Shir Zablodovsky described the ongoing conflict as 'a chess game, not a short war.' 'The difficulty in this game is that there are many players with significant military power,' she said. 'This is a historical era which will redesign the Middle East.'

Explosions heard at US base near Iraq-Syria border, report says	Pro-Iranian Iraqi militia-affiliated news agency Sabereen News reported Sunday on explosions at the Al-Tanf base, a U.S.-controlled military installation near the Iraq-Syria border. The report, attributed to a militia-associated source, alleged that the base was attacked by drones, although official confirmation was not immediately available. Earlier, Iraq’s pro-Iran Kataib Hezbollah, part of the so-called Islamic Resistance in Iraq, issued a statement condemning Israel’s recent strikes on Iranian targets, reportedly conducted through Iraqi airspace. The group described the air raids as 'a dangerous precedent that Iran had not previously encountered,' warning that the use of Iraqi and regional airspace to facilitate such attacks could not have occurred 'without prior coordination and agreement with the U.S., which controls Iraqi skies.' The militia group warned the U.S. that 'aggression against Iran represents a serious violation that should not go unanswered' and that America 'must pay for its recklessness.' Additionally, the statement emphasized that if Israel 'is not made to pay a heavy price for its aggression, it will likely continue to escalate its actions, not only against Iran but potentially against Iraq as well.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk00gsfhg1x	2024-10-27T11:59:20-07:00

Israel probes truck's ‘black box’ for clues in suspected Glilot a...	Body of driver Rami Nasrallah to undergo autopsy to determine if he suffered a heart attack before the crash that killed one and injured dozens; police disclose he had nearly 70 prior traffic violations Israeli authorities announced on Sunday they are analyzing data from the 'black box' of a truck involved in a suspected ramming attack in Glilot, which resulted in one fatality and injuries to 36 others. Officials have not yet confirmed if the incident was deliberate or a freak accident. The truck's Electronic Control Module (ECM), often called a 'black box,' captures data like speed, braking and engine status, especially useful in accident investigations. The driver, identified as Rami Nasrallah from Qalansawe, reportedly had about 70 previous traffic violations. His body was sent to Tel Aviv’s National Center of Forensic Medicine for an autopsy to determine if a medical event, such as a heart attack, might have contributed to the incident. Nasrallah’s family has denied any terrorist motives, claiming he had a heart condition and had recently undergone open-heart surgery. 'It was not an attack,' said his brother, Mahmoud Nasrallah. 'My brother has health issues and wouldn’t do such a thing. He is a simple man just trying to earn a living and go home. He has no connection to anything like that, either closely or distantly. 'He probably had a heart attack or something that happened; he has a medical history. He is married and has five children. We want his body returned to us. He is an ordinary person who went out to provide for his kids; they can check this. This was just an accident; he has never harmed anyone in his life.' The police said they were considering all possible motives and assigned the case to the Tel Aviv district's central unit, and initial findings dismissed claims from witnesses suggesting the driver was armed with a knife. Meanwhile, the identity of the deceased has not been disclosed. Most of the injured were retired bankers on a group trip, and six remain in serious condition.

IDF directs media to Hezbollah's secret cash bunker under Beirut ...	IDF Arabic spokesman directs journalists to revisit Beirut’s Al-Sahel Hospital, alleging Hezbollah bunker with $500 million hidden beneath; he calls on Lebanon’s media and government to investigate, asserting Israeli intelligence identified concealed entry IDF Arabic-language spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee addressed Lebanese journalists on Sunday, directing them to search for an alleged Hezbollah underground bunker beneath Beirut's Al-Sahel Hospital. The facility, according to the military, is reportedly used by Hezbollah as a secure storage site for approximately $500 million in assets. Lt. Col. Adraee’s remarks follow attempts by Lebanese journalists to locate the entrance to the bunker. Adraee questioned journalists’ expectations, saying, 'Did you expect Hezbollah to simply guide you to Nasrallah’s hideout?' He emphasized that Hezbollah would likely take measures to obscure the site’s true purpose but confirmed that Israeli intelligence had identified the entrance location. In a detailed description, Adraee referenced various televised reports that showed Lebanese journalists searching a basement area under the hospital. The footage, he explained, shows key features, such as a 15-meter wall suspected of hiding the bunker entrance. He encouraged journalists and authorities to revisit the site, examine structural points like stairwells and walls, and investigate further to confirm the bunker’s existence. Adraee concluded by inviting Lebanon’s government, international human rights organizations and media to examine the hospital’s alleged Hezbollah connections, noting Israel’s knowledge of other related locations and activities.

We're fashioning post-war Gaza': The contractor set to facilitat...	Israeli businessman Moti Kahana, head of US-based logistics company GDC chosen to deliver aid to Palestinian enclave, says Hamas' days of looting aid and selling it are almost over 'We're not here to replace the IDF, to hunt down terrorists or kill Hamas operatives. Our role will be to secure humanitarian aid and ensure that civilians in Gaza receive it and that Hamas and other criminals don't steal it. This will give a better future for Gazans and allow Israel to focus on fighting terrorism where it needs to. The U.S. Army sometimes brings in contractors and that’s how we should be seen too.' So says Moti Kahana, an American-Israeli businessman and CEO of the American logistics company GDC, which has been chosen to serve as a contractor to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza by the IDF and secure 'humanitarian zones,' which will be like neighborhoods in Gaza cleared from terrorists. GDC has been in talks with the Defense Ministry and the U.S. for seven months, but things have come to fruition only now. Israel has concluded that international organizations can no longer distribute humanitarian aid because it has been looted by Hamas, allowing it to maintain its grip on power. At first, some ministers, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, demanded that IDF soldiers distribute aid. However, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi opposed this, leading to the idea of enlisting a company with extensive experience in this area. Kahana is known for rescuing the last Jew from Afghanistan and for standing behind humanitarian operations in Syria and Iraq, such as bringing hundreds of injured Syrians to Safed's Ziv Medical Center in 2016. His security company will protect the humanitarian convoys to secure neighborhoods in Gaza, which will be cleared of terrorists. The company, which presented its plan to the U.S. State Department and the White House, operates under international law and maintains contact with the UN, the World Bank and various humanitarian organizations. 'I'm essentially a contractor. The company is made up of former soldiers from elite units in the U.S., UK and France. The common denominator is that none of them are Jewish,' Kahana said in an interview with Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth. 'There will surely be incidents when the IDF distributes aid, as has happened in the past, and civilians would get killed. The whole world goes crazy, and antisemitism skyrockets. When an IDF soldier tries to help, the world screams 'Jews are killing Arabs.' I'm not distributing aid as the IDF does but as a logistics company.' A new sheriff in town 'Gaza is starting to look like Somalia,' Kahana added. 'I saw this in Afghanistan. The Islamic State began with bombings against the Taliban. That's what's going to happen in Gaza. When you bring in aid, you’re bringing in money and then Hamas tries to steal it. It's not only Hamas; there are also criminal organizations. Then attacks will start within Gaza, and fatalities won't include only Palestinian civilians.' According to Kahana, his company's employees have extensive experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. 'These are people with 25 years of experience or more. They've been in Baghdad and Kabul. This is what's going to happen: You, as Israelis, bring in aid, don't secure it and criminals or Hamas steal it and build terrorist capabilities.' 'You're putting in money to fund them. That's our job. The company is made up of 'war junkies,' people who love fighting bad guys. They really believe this is the right thing to do,' he explained. Aren't you afraid of Hamas and what will happen in Gaza? 'We are, but we have the experience to ensure we don’t die. You trust your equipment and your background. These are people who have fought terrorism their whole lives.' What will happen if someone tries to rob your convoys? 'First of all, there's an initial team that comes in with protective gear and non-lethal equipment. The first line is not there to fight. They can deter using rubber bullets, water or warning shots. But if that doesn’t help, the second team will come in. If something happens, we'll send a message to Gazan residents: you don’t want to mess with us. 'I promise you that message will get through quickly. They'll understand that a new sheriff is in town. There may be a bit of chaos at first, but they’ll get it soon enough. What’s important is that they will discover there’s food, bakeries and kindergartens in protected neighborhoods. We're the ones fashioning post-war Gaza.' Kahana stressed the company will initially operate as a pilot project but plans to expand its activities throughout Gaza. 'I want to stress that we’re not talking about a ghetto. People will be able to come and go from the secured neighborhoods. There will be plenty of food and excellent schools inside. 'Before long, all of Gaza will want to look like this and we’ll build another neighborhood and another. The whole world will contribute money if they see there’s hope. The same thing happened in Baghdad.' 24/7 coordination with the IDF 'This will begin stabilizing post-war Gaza,' Kahana continued, 'so that people there will understand there’s free food available. There isn’t a starvation problem in Gaza. The problem is that criminals steal food and sell it, becoming very rich. The American plan is to flood Gaza with so much food that the price of sugar won’t make it worth stealing.' 'Israel delivered over $500 million to Gaza in humanitarian aid in one year. Hamas took that aid and sold it and now they have money. If you want to destroy Hamas – stop funding them,' he said. One of the people managing the project is an extraordinary figure: Justin Sapp, a Green Beret colonel and CIA officer. After the September 11 attacks, he and 11 other soldiers were sent to Afghanistan by the U.S., riding horses to capture one of the country's major cities. His story, along with his comrades, was the basis for the film 12 Strong. He's now constructing the entire operation strategy for operating in Gaza. Aren’t you worried about clashing with IDF soldiers? 'That's what I fear the most. I need 24/7 coordination with the IDF and that’s why I brought in several former high-ranking Israelis from the Mossad, the Border Police Counter-Terrorism Unit and others to be responsible for those stationed at the command post.' How much will your aid cost? 'We told the Americans, 'You wasted $350 million on a pier that sank after eight weeks.' We gave the Americans a discount: $200 million for six months and it won't sink.'

Dr. Homayoun Sameh voices support for Iran’s 'legitimate defense' against what he describes as 'aggression by Zionist regime on Iranian territory' A member of Iran’s parliament representing the Jewish community condemned on Sunday Israel's strikes on Iran over the weekend and called for a 'strong response to this aggression at the appropriate time.' Dr. Homayoun Sameh voiced his support for Iran’s 'legitimate defense' against what he described as 'aggression by the Zionist regime on Iranian territory.' Offering condolences to the families of Iranian soldiers killed in the attack, he acknowledged their sacrifice, saying they 'gave their lives for the country.' He also praised Iran’s military and the Revolutionary Guard, commending their commitment to 'safeguarding the nation’s security.' Dr. Sameh added that, despite reports, Iran’s air defenses had been effective, intercepting 'numerous enemy drones targeting military sites.' Dismissing the strike’s impact as 'minimal,' he argued that reports of extensive damage were 'false propaganda' and emphasized that the aircraft involved had 'failed to penetrate Iranian airspace.' Criticizing Western support for Israel, Dr. Sameh said, 'The Zionist regime instigated these hostilities and has repeatedly engaged in acts of terror and sabotage.'

Hamas offers new deal: End the war or no hostage deal	Senior Hamas official says terror group plans to present 'comprehensive deal to end war,' which includes Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and release of all hostages Hamas officials revealed that the terror group plans to propose a 'comprehensive deal to end the war immediately,' Saudi network Asharq reported on Sunday. The proposal would call for Israel to withdraw its forces from the Gaza Strip as part of a prisoner exchange that includes the release of all Israeli hostages. A senior Hamas official emphasized that such a deal 'would end the war once and for all, and would include a prisoner swap where all Israeli hostages are released in exchange for an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons.' The official added that Hamas would consider other ideas from mediators but stressed that ending the war is non-negotiable. 'Without that, there will be no deal,' he declared. Another senior Hamas official, speaking anonymously with the Qatari channel The New Arab, dismissed Israel’s claims of a shift in Hamas’ position following the death of its leader Yahya Sinwar, saying, 'Those claims show that they do not understand how decisions are made within Hamas,' he asserted. 'Hamas’ principles remain unchanged, before and after Sinwar. We have made our red lines clear to all mediators — full withdrawal from Gaza, the return of all displaced persons to their homes across the region and the assistance and reconstruction necessary for our people.' Meanwhile, the Security Cabinet is set to convene on Sunday, with ministers expected to receive an update on hostage negotiations. The meeting follows Mossad Director David Barnea's anticipated departure for Doha, where he will attend a summit with the CIA director and the Qatari prime minister. The gathering is intended to jumpstart negotiations. The summit facilitates direct talks between negotiation teams to finalize deal details. Later, an expanded four-party summit involving Egypt is expected. Over the last three weeks, Barnea has worked on a new framework, which he shared with the Egyptian intelligence chief in Cairo on Thursday. This proposal is expected to be adjusted to incorporate aspects of the Egyptian framework and additional strategies.

Israeli retirees victims in suspected ramming attack in Glilot; 1...	Bus taking participants on guided tour of the area arrived seconds before truck rammed bus stop, killing at least one and injuring dozens After one Israeli was killed and at least 37 others injured in varying severities after a suspected truck ramming attack near Glilot, police are still investigating the incident to say whether it was a planned attack or an unusual accident. Most of the injured in the incident were retirees who arrived in the area as part of a guided tour. 'As soon as we stopped and started getting off [the bus], we heard a boom. I turned around and saw people being thrown about,' Avraham Zohar, who participated in the tour, recounted. 'My wife was thrown and then dropped to the ground because she thought it was a bombing attack. I picked her up and started moving forward. I went back because people were piling and we began pulling them out one by one. It was a graphic sight, but we had no choice. The truck driver was trapped inside and we told the police and then I heard two or three gunshots and realized they had neutralized' the driver, he said. Zohar said the police informed them that it was a terror attack. 'We didn't realize it was a terror attack. The police came and said it probably was. An officer asked where the truck driver was. I told him he was stuck inside. The officer climbed up and started talking to him, and the driver began moving and then I heard gunshots.' Yechiel Ben Moshe, an 81-year-old from Petah Tikva, also participated in the tour. 'We were a group of retirees going to Glilot to visit a museum and listen to a lecture,' he said. 'The bus parked, and people got off. A truck came from behind and I heard a huge noise from the truck; it drove toward us to run us over.' 'I moved aside and managed to escape while others around me fell and some were hit. I was already off the bus so I wasn’t hurt. Around me, everyone was injured and bleeding, and others were in shock. It looked like an accident at first, but then shots were fired at the terrorist,' he added. Shuki Green was also on the scene as part of the tour. 'When we were told to get off the bus, my wife and I exited through the front door and were lucky to be unharmed,' he said. 'Those who got off through the middle door were hit by the truck. We didn’t realize it was a terror attack. Some said the driver was holding a knife but I didn’t see it. I thought a missile had landed because there was dust and metal and stones flying in the air. I ran and fell several times,' he said. 'We saw the truck speeding and it was lucky the bus had stopped,' his wife Dvora added. 'Large forces arrived immediately. Everything was chaotic, and a thick cloud of smoke formed. We heard a boom at the moment of the ramming. It was an attack; he sped toward us, where the people were standing. We had been really looking forward to this trip.' National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Police Commissioner Daniel Levy also arrived at the scene. 'This incident is being investigated as a terror attack and that's how it should be treated. I fully support the police and civilians who neutralized the attacker,' Ben-Gvir said. The driver, Rami Nasrallah from the Arab town of Qalansawe, was shot and killed. His relatives claimed the incident wasn't a terror attack. 'That's a lie. Rami suffers from illnesses and lost control of the truck due to a medical issue,' a relative said.

Hamas says offering comprehensive deal, but must end war	Hamas officials revealed on the Saudi network A-Sharq that the terrorist organization will offer the mediators participating in the summit in Doha 'a comprehensive deal to end the war immediately, which includes Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, combined with a prisoner exchange, including all the Israeli hostages.' A senior Hamas official said: 'Today the Egyptian, Qatari and American mediators are meeting with Israeli officials. We will listen to their proposals, but for our part we prefer a comprehensive deal that will take place in one fell swoop.' According to him, such a deal 'will end the war once and for all.

Hezbollah fires one of its largest volleys on the Galilee area resulting in injuries in the Arab town of Tamra in northern Israel; IDF continues to fight terror group in Lebanon A 57-year-old woman was seriously injured on Sunday after a Hezbollah rocket hit Tamra, an Arab town located in northern Israel. Magen David Adom emergency service paramedics arrived on the scene and gave her medical attention alongside another resident who sustained minor injuries. Another home in the town suffered a direct hit. The IDF Spokesperson's Unit said shortly after the incident that 75 rockets were identified crossing from Lebanon to northern Israel in Hezbollah's barrage, marking one of the heaviest seen toward the Galilee region since the war began. Meanwhile, as the fighting against the Iran-backed terror group continues, the IDF began expanding its operations in South Lebanon into the second line of towns and villages some 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the border with Israel, after finding massive stores of Iranian-made and Russian-made weapons and ammunition in every home. Initially, the IDF said publicly and assured the U.S. that it would limit its offensive to removing the threat of an invasion of the Galilee by Hezbollah's Radwan force, in an area containing up to 20 Shiite villages, spread along the 130-kilometer (81-mile) frontier.

Israel destroyed facility manufacturing 'critical components,' Sa...	Israeli official says operation destroyed Iranian facility manufacturing surface-to-surface missiles and critical components for propelling them, and believes Iran is unlikely to respond; The Biden administration is reportedly satisfied with the strike, which might adversely affect Russian capabilities against Ukraine In a daring nocturnal Friday operation, Israel targeted Iranian facilities pivotal to the production of surface-to-surface missiles, delivering a strategic blow that complicates Tehran's future missile manufacturing efforts. An informed Israeli insider said on Saturday that 'with the added impairment of air defense systems, the intended message is unmistakable.' He emphasized that any Iranian retaliation against Israel could provoke a far more robust counteraction, leaving Iran 'vulnerable and exposed.' The New York Times highlighted this strike as an assault on a 'critical component.' The Saudi website Elaph, known for its occasional insights from the Israeli defense sphere, cited a knowledgeable source stating that the targeted components were numerous fuel mixers at a facility integral for propelling the 'Kheibar' and 'Qassem' ballistic missiles, previously launched toward Israel on October 1. The report estimated each mixer's value at a minimum of $2 million. Industry insiders from Iran's missile sector, referenced in the report, indicated that the facility's operational recovery would take no less than two years, marking a profound disruption to Iran's missile production capabilities. A fuel mixer is a critical component for producing special solid fuel used to propel precision missiles. Missiles with liquid fuel need to be positioned upright for fueling, making them easy to detect and vulnerable. Solid fuel propulsion allows for better protection under cover and, more importantly, precision targeting; The same fuel is used in a computerized mechanism that navigates the missile by emitting combustion jets in different directions, achieving accuracy to within a meter and allowing for mid-flight trajectory adjustments. This makes it much easier to hit strategic targets and harder to intercept. 'The U.S. benefits from this strike' The informed source stated that 'Israel complied with Biden's request not to attack oil and nuclear facilities; there was an agreement between Israel and the Americans regarding targeting military objectives. The U.S. benefits from this strike because Iran will struggle to produce missiles and transfer them to Russia against Ukraine,' he said. Despite reports that Arab and European countries sent warning messages to Iran, the source claimed Israel did not warn Iran before the attack. 'In the strike, Israel hit the surface-to-surface missile production plants in three waves, thereby preventing them from continuing missile production. There was maximum coordination with the Americans,' he said. 'This was no mere skirmish; it was a strategic blow that signals an end to the era of fearing Iran,' asserted the source. 'Israel intended for Iran to fully grasp the severity of the situation. Prepared for any escalation, Israel watched as Iran opted for retreat. The regime is now attempting to downplay the magnitude of the strike, but deep down, they understand the reality.' Visuals of Air Force jets embarking on the Iranian mission 'Israeli intelligence moved through Iran unimpeded, and the Air Force executed its operations freely. By dawn, Tehran found its air defenses weakened and its ballistic missile capabilities compromised. The Ayatollahs' response was to concede. This marks a shift in the status quo,' according to a high-ranking Israeli official. Another senior figure commented on the domestic reaction. 'While public sentiment may crave more overt displays of power, it is the duty of the leadership to evaluate and decide based on comprehensive security and diplomatic considerations. The collaboration with the U.S. is a crucial factor in this equation,' he said. Biden hoping for a conclusion Concurrently, top U.S. officials believe Iran is unlikely to retaliate against Israel's strike, in light of Israel's extensive reach. 'No developments are expected before the elections,' an official suggested. 'Our alliance with Israel has been steadfast. A massive defense initiative is in place to safeguard Israel, incorporating the most advanced defense systems. Our commitment to supporting Israel is clear, and both Israel and Iran are well aware of this.' Senior officials asserted that Israel was fully justified in defending itself by launching a strike against Iran. 'What Iran did to Israel on October 1 is something no nation should tolerate,' one commented. 'The Iranians are keenly aware Israel can reach any target it chooses. I don't anticipate a counteraction from them in response to Israel's move. I suspect they will refrain from retaliation — but time will tell.' U.S. President Joe Biden expressed hope that the cycle of reciprocal strikes between Israel and Iran would cease, noting that Israel did not appear to target non-military sites. On the other hand, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi declared that Tehran has 'no limits' concerning its defense of territorial integrity, yet he stopped short of making explicit threats of retaliation. The Israeli operation in Iran received unanimous approval in a political-security cabinet meeting conducted via telephone, lasting about an hour. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a cabinet member, stated post-Sabbath that 'the strike on Iran serves as a crucial opening maneuver to weaken Iran's strategic assets, and it must pave the way for subsequent actions. This is my stance, and I will continue to advocate for it in the appropriate forums. We bear a historical responsibility to neutralize the Iranian threat to Israel's existence.'

We woke up to very loud booms that lasted for almost three hours...	Azita, a resident of Tehran, talks to Ynet about the ordeal Iranians went through as Israel attacked, long lines at gas stations, regime efforts to project normalcy and the desire to show Israel that Iran isn't just another Gaza 'Despite being prepared that the confrontation was approaching, it caught us by surprise,' Azita, a resident of Tehran, tells Ynet. 'We woke up to very loud booms. This lasted for almost three hours. It's a strange mix of emotions: many of us in the opposition are hopefully waiting for an Israeli attack, because what could be worse than the current situation? But it's still frightening. Bombs are still being dropped on your home, on your country. The colors in the sky, the movement, the sounds – it was very, very scary. We're used to seeing these things on TV from Lebanon and Gaza, and suddenly it was above our heads. 'There were two types of reactions once we realized the attack had begun. There were the people who support the regime, who immediately took to the streets, gathered and started marching and shouting that nothing happened, that the Israeli attack did no damage, and that the regime succeeded in keeping the citizens safe. And then there were the more practical people. They got into their cars with fuel containers and drove to gas stations, both to stock up in case of a shortage or price increase and to have the option to escape Tehran in case it became a primary target. People waited for hours in line at gas stations. 'State-run media quickly reported that the Iranian air defense proved itself much more than its Israeli counterpart. They repeatedly said Iranians should be proud of themselves and the regime that provided them protection from the 'Zionist enemy,' but the truth is that among many people, even among regime supporters, there is a certain degree of skepticism about these statements. The Israeli planes managed to bomb Iran. 'In the eyes of many, this is a crossing of red lines that Iran should not have allowed to be crossed. The regime and the authorities made every effort to return everything to normal as quickly as possible, ensuring there were no disruptions to daily life. They tried to convey that nothing happened, that it was an unsuccessful Israeli attempt. Many people walked the streets, the parks were full, and so were the markets. There was an attempt, more than usual, to project normalcy. 'Opinions here are also divided. Some people say it's a disgrace that we were bombed and that Iran must respond like a country whose sovereignty has been violated, but there are also many others who think the attack shows Iran's strength. They feared that Israel would bomb the oil sites or the nuclear bases and facilities and, in the end, it didn't happen, so there's a bit of relief. But the general feeling is a desire for revenge, to show Israel that Iran is neither Lebanon nor Gaza. 'All the attacks and repeated attacks are nerve-wracking. You don't know what to expect, when, how or with what intensity. There's also no one to really share with because there aren't many answers; we all live in constant uncertainty. The authorities have also increased their control over censorship and warned of severe punishments for anyone who shares materials from the attack with Western media. So, it's a fear that comes at you from both sides.'

Severing ties with UNRWA could suspend Israel's membership in UN,...	Bill up for final vote Monday could signal an Israeli violation of the UN charter leading to a suspension of membership in the international body Foreign Ministry officials on Sunday warned against legislation being advanced in the Knesset to cut official ties with the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, Israel's membership in the United Nations could be suspended for violating the body's charter. The bill, proposed by Likud lawmaker Boaz Bismuth, a close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is scheduled for a second and final reading on Monday and has broad support. Opposition Leader Yair Lapid said he was for the legislation calling UNRWA a disaster. Israel revealed the involvement of UNRWA employees in the Hamas atrocities of Oct. 7 last year and the identity of another member of the organization who was a Hamas operative in Lebanon. According to the proposed law, Israel would sever ties with UNRWA, it would lose its diplomatic status, its officials would be prohibited from having contact with the agency, its employees would be refused visas and customs officials would not be able to handle their imported equipment and goods. UNRWA's tax benefits would also be revoked at a later date. U.S. Ambassador Jack Lew asked opposition party leaders to agree to postpone a vote on the bill until after the November 5 U.S. presidential elections. Bismuth was also asked by members of Netanyahu's coalition, to delay the vote. U.N Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that if the legislation passes, UNRWA will be unable to continue operating and would then need to raise the issue at the UN General Assembly. 'It’s deeply concerning that legislation is being considered in a member state of the United Nations that would fundamentally contradict the principles of the UN Charter,' Guterres wrote in an urgent letter to Netanyahu earlier this month. The draft legislation currently under discussion in the Knesset, if passed, could prevent UNRWA from continuing its operations in the occupied Palestinian territories, thereby denying Palestinian refugees in Gaza and the West Bank the essential aid and protection that UNRWA has provided them since 1949,' he wrote. Guterres said UNRWA operates in nearly 400 schools and more than 65 health clinics in the West Bank. providing education to more than 350,000 children and over 5 million medical consultations annually. 'UNRWA also provides vital assistance to the poor and social services,' Guterres wrote. According to the senior Foreign Ministry officials and other professionals, there is no doubt that UNRWA is a corrupt, rogue organization that is part of the problem and not the solution. But despite that, the proposed legislation could be more problematic for Israel than for UNRWA. 'We know there are anti-Israeli elements and Palestinians who are waiting for such legislation to unleash the gates of hell on us,' they said. 'This would bring Israel to violating the UN charter.'

Amit Chayut and Master Sergeant (res.) Gilad Elmaliach all served at the 8207th Battalion The IDF Spokesperson's Unit reported on Sunday that four reserve soldiers were killed in action in southern Lebanon as part of Israel's ground operation against Hezbollah. They are: Major (res.) Eliav Amram Abitbol, 36, from Eitan, a Company Deputy Commander in the 8207th Battalion, 228th Brigade; Captain (res.) Rabbi Avraham Yosef Goldberg, 43, from Jerusalem, a Military Rabbi in the 8207th Battalion, 228th Brigade; Captain (res.) Amit Chayut, 29, from Haifa, a Platoon Commander in the 8207th Battalion, 228th Brigade and Master Sergeant (res.) Gilad Elmaliach, 30, from Jerusalem, a soldier in the 8207th Battalion, 228th Brigade. Three additional reserve soldiers and one soldier in compulsory service from the 8207th Battalion were severely injured, alongside a combat engineering officer from the 228th Brigade. 'The soldiers fell and were injured in a battle with terrorists in southern Lebanon. The details of the battle are under investigation,' The IDF said in a statement. 'Amit was a wonderful person with a heart of gold' Captain (Res.) Amit Hayut, 29, from Haifa, was killed in a battle in southern Lebanon. 'Our hearts are broken; Amit was a wonderful person with a heart of gold, a cheerful, responsible and noble man. He was always surrounded by friends,' his brother Dvir said. Amit was the son of Tzippi and Yehoshua and the youngest in his family. After his studies, he attended a year-and-a-half-long pre-military program and enlisted in the Golani Brigade. He completed a commanders' course with honors. Amit had a partner named Shiri, also a resident of Haifa, and his family said that the couple planned to get married. 'He completed over 300 days in the reserves. He had been serving in the north since October 7 and we knew he was now in southern Lebanon,' his brother said. 'The last time we talked with him was when he took a short break during Sukkot a week and a half ago. He returned on Saturday and we hadn't heard from him since he entered Lebanon,' he recounted. A day after Rosh Hashanah, Captain (res.) Rabbi Avraham Yosef Goldberg, wrote on his Facebook page: 'Everyone has left their families and children, eager to go out to Your war, fighting to save brothers from the threat of murder. How many tears and hearts and souls and eyes have been poured out to You! Approaching the Holy Ark, filled with awe, with an incredible sense of mission and You will hear their cry from the heavens and their plea for help.' 'Their cries are here, calling out before You, and You will fight their battles for them, that they may not falter with their weapons, nor fail in their running, nor be frightened by the fire of the enemy and You will uproot the government of evil from the land!' The Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot published a statement mourning the loss of Master Sergeant (res.) Gilad Elmaliach, saying: 'The Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot, its rabbis, students and alumni mourn the death of our alumnus Gilad Elmaliach, in the battle for the revival of Israel and in defense of the northern border.

Israel miscalculates will of Iranians, supreme leader says	In his first response to the Israeli attack on Iran's military targets including its aerial defenses, Al Khamenei says the response must be determined by the best interests of the Iranian people people Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said on Sunday that Israel made a mistake when it attacked Iran. Speaking for the first time since the Israeli strike on Iranian military targets early on Saturday, Khamenei said Israel miscalculated and must understand the will of the Iranian people. 'The evil committed by the Zionist regime (Israel) two nights ago should neither be downplayed nor exaggerated', Khamenei said. He said Iran's power should be demonstrated to Israel, adding that the way to do so should be 'determined by the officials and that which is in the best interest of the people and the country should take place.' An Iranian official told the Hezbollah-affiliated Al Akhbar newspaper that Iran maintains the right to defend itself against any aggression. 'Whether its response would be immediate is unclear and the decision will be made based on security and political considerations and the conditions in the region,' the official said adding that Iran prefers to preserve its territorial integrity rather than engaging with Israel's plans to alter the regional order and break up the 'axis of resistance.'

British man sentenced to 12 years in prison for encouraging terro...	Gabriel Budasz, 24, was convicted on four counts of encouraging terrorism, including against Jews; The investigation began after the British Jewish security organization CST collected evidence from his social media accounts Gabriel Budasz, 24, who encouraged his followers on social media to carry out acts of terrorism - including against Jews in the country - was sentenced to 12 years in prison in Britain. He was convicted of four counts of encouraging terrorism, one count of distributing terrorist propaganda and one count of sending an electronic message with intent to cause distress or anxiety. Budasz, who was born in Poland and lived in Weston-super-Mare, in North Somerset, UK, published detailed instructions on how to make explosives from readily available household items, and created a plastic gun using a 3D printer. Judge Brian Forster wrote in the sentence, published Thursday: 'The evidence reveals that you had a clear interest in white supremacy, other terrorists including Brenton Tarrant, and massacres, including the shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand.' The judge later said: 'You also posted on Twitter: 'I'm going to build a bomb'. You distributed instructions on how to build a bomb, with the intention of encouraging terrorism.' Among the materials Budasz posted online was a video of him wearing clothes similar to the outfit Trent wore the day he live-streamed the 2019 murder of 51 Muslims at two Christchurch mosques. 'You said things like 'kill the Jews, kill the political leaders'. You also encouraged the need to take action,' Judge Forster added. Budasz posted a video on Telegram with 'horrifying and graphic' footage and gave instructions on how to torture and eventually murder a victim with a knife. The British Jewish security organization CST began investigating the defendant's online activity in September 2022. The organization said they collected evidence from Budasz's social media accounts, and handed the evidence over to counter-terrorism police in the summer of 2023. Budasz was arrested on August 1, 2023. During his trial, Budasz claimed that the videos he posted online were meant to be funny, from the point of view of a 'comedic' far-right figure. However, Judge Forster said that 'there is no direct connection between Budasz's mental disorder and his crimes.' During a search of Budasz s home in August 2023, various items of a far-right nature were seized books, masks and memorabilia, as well as a 3D-printed firearm.

Israel mulls expansion of Lebanon offensive	Forces operating in South Lebanon find massive amounts of weapons and ammunition placed in advanced of a planned invasion of the Galilee; commanders on the ground push for more time The IDF began expanding its operations in South Lebanon into the second line of towns and villages some 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the border with Israel, after finding massive stores of Iranian and Russian-made weapons and ammunition in every home. Initially, the IDF said publicly and ensured the U.S. that it would limit its offensive to removing the threat of an invasion of the Galilee by Hezbollah's Radwan force, in an area containing up to 20 Shiite villages, spread along the 130-kilometer (81-mile) frontier. A decision to continue to expand the offensive to include up to 70 villages and towns would depend on the government, the rising number of casualties and the urging of military commanders on the ground, to allow them to fight on. The military believes there are between 5,000 and 10,000 well-maintained weapons in every village, put there to await Hezbollah's planned invasion. According to the IDF, it is easier for infantry troops operating in South Lebanon to capture members of the Radwan Force, because of their ability to maneuver quietly, in the terrain. Tanks and APCs are more exposed to Hezbollah's attacks. Troops have also begun using the weapons and ammunition found in the villages, that would eventually have to be destroyed. On Saturday, a controlled detonation of some 400 tons of explosives, triggered earthquake warnings.

Russian plane lands in Israel for possible mediation effort with ...	Israeli officials refuse to comment on an aircraft from Moscow, which landed in the country as reports suggest the Kremlin is negotiating the release of Israeli-Russian hostages in Gaza A Russian aircraft landed in Israel on Thursday afternoon and later headed back to Moscow for reasons that are currently not clear. Officials denied reports a Russian delegation arrived in the country to negotiate the release of two Israeli-Russian captives held by Hamas: Alexander (Sahsa) Trufanov and Maxim Herkin. Hamas' deputy politburo head Mousa Abu Marzouk visited Moscow on the same day and spoke with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov about their release. Abu Marzouk said that the two Russian citizens would be a high priority for release in any future deal with the terror group. The Russian arrival in Israel raised several questions: Why did a Russian plane connected to Russian President Vladimir Putin arrive? Was its arrival related to the delivery of messages from Israel to Iran via Russia or was it an attempt by Putin to mediate between Israel and Iran? Did Russia convey Israel's messages to Iran, clarifying that nuclear facilities would not be targeted but military sites would be and that Israel would retaliate harshly should Iran attack again? Israeli officials declined to comment on the plane's landing, leaving answers unclear. The Tu-214SR aircraft that landed in Israel is part of the special 'Russia' flight unit, which is under Putin's administration. Russian media reported the plane had previously landed at Ben Gurion Airport on October 17. The reports added that Hezbollah temporarily halted its rocket fire into Israeli territory for several hours during the Russian plane's stay. During a weekend press conference, Putin said that Israel faced a terrorist attack last year, but that its response was disproportionate and cannot be forgiven. 'No person on Earth can help but feel their heart bleed when they see what is happening in the Gaza Strip,' Putin said. He suggested that the war could be resolved via the establishment of a Palestinian state, adding that Russia 'is in close contact with Iran.' He also stressed Russia's intention to resolve Tehran's conflict with Israel based on compromises. 'Russia has been attempting to mediate between Iran and Israel for several weeks now,' social activist Alex Tenzer, who monitors Russian media, said. 'This is evident from Putin's words and meetings between Russia's Bogdanov and Israel's ambassador to Russia. Russia is trying to preserve its interests in the Middle East which are steadily deteriorating as Iran loses power.'

Satellite images show aftermath of Israel strike on secret Iran b...	Images show damage to Parchin missile production site; expert says even if key materials removed before strikes building would have provided 'intrinsic value for future nuclear weapons-related activities. An American researcher said an Israeli airstrike on Saturday hit a building that was part of Iran's defunct nuclear weapons development program, and he and another researcher said facilities used to mix solid fuel for missiles also were struck. The assessments based on commercial satellite imagery were reached separately by David Albright, a former U.N. weapons inspector, and Decker Eveleth, an associate research analyst at CNA, a Washington think tank. They told Reuters that Israel struck buildings in Parchin, a massive military complex near Tehran. Israel also hit Khojir, according to Eveleth, a sprawling missile production site near Tehran. Reuters reported in July that Khojir was undergoing massive expansion. Eveleth said the Israeli strikes may have 'significantly hampered Iran's ability to mass produce missiles.' The Israeli military said three waves of Israeli jets struck missile factories and other sites near Tehran and in western Iran early on Saturday in retaliation for Tehran's Oct. 1 barrage of more than 200 missiles against Israel. Iran's military said the Israeli warplanes used 'very light warheads' to strike border radar systems in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan and around Tehran. In posts on X, Albright said commercial satellite imagery showed that Israel hit a building in Parchin called Taleghan 2 that was used for testing activities during the Amad Plan, Iran's defunct nuclear weapons development program. The U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and U.S. intelligence say Iran shuttered the program in 2003. Iran denies pursuing nuclear weapons. Albright, head of the Institute for Science and International Security research group, was given access to the program's files for a book after they were stolen from Tehran by Israel's Mossad intelligence agency in 2018. On X, he said the archives revealed that Iran kept important test equipment in Taleghan 2. Iran may have removed key materials before the airstrike, he said, but 'even if no equipment remained inside' the building would have provided 'intrinsic value' for future nuclear weapons-related activities. Albright told Reuters that commercial satellite imagery of Parchin showed Israel damaged three buildings about 350 yards (320 m) from Taleghan 2, including two in which solid fuel for ballistic missiles was mixed. He did not identify the commercial firm from which he obtained the images. Eveleth said an image of Parchin from Planet Labs, a commercial satellite firm, showed that Israel destroyed three ballistic missile solid fuel mixing buildings and a warehouse in the sprawling complex. Planet Labs imagery also showed that an Israeli strike destroyed two buildings in the Khojir complex where solid fuel for ballistic missiles was mixed, he said. The buildings were enclosed by high dirt berms, according to the image reviewed by Reuters. Such structures are associated with missile production and are designed to stop a blast in one building from detonating combustible materials in nearby structures. 'Israel says they targeted buildings housing solid-fuel mixers,' Eveleth said. 'These industrial mixers are hard to make and export-controlled. Iran imported many over the years at great expense, and will likely have a hard time replacing them.' With a limited operation, he said, Israel may have struck a significant blow against Iran's ability to mass-produce missiles and made it more difficult for any future Iranian missile attack to pierce Israel's missile defenses. 'The strikes appear to be highly accurate,' he said. Axios reported that Israel destroyed hit 12 'planetary mixers' used to produce solid fuel for long-range ballistic missiles, quoting three unnamed Israeli sources as saying this severely damages Iran's ability to renew its missile stockpile and could deter Iran from further massive missile strikes against Israel. Iran has the Middle East's largest missile arsenal and supplied missiles to Russia for use against Ukraine, and to Yemen's Houthi rebels and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, according to U.S. officials. Tehran and Moscow deny that Russia has received Iranian missiles. Planet Labs imagery reviewed earlier this year by Eveleth and Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey showed major expansions at Khojir and the Modarres military complex near Tehran that the pair assessed were for boosting missile production, Reuters reported. Three senior Iranian officials confirmed that conclusion.

Iran's vulnerability after Israel's attack concerning, officials ...	After Israel takes out Iranian aid defense systems protecting critical oil, petrochemical and gas sites sources say Iran's respond must be carefully considered because of the risks posed by another Israeli strike Israel's attack on Iranian air defenses early on Saturday has raised deep alarm in Iran, according to three Iranian officials who spoke to the New York Times. They protected several critical oil and petrochemical refineries and a large gas field and a major port in southern Iran, critical energy, and economic hubs, leaving them vulnerable to attack if the exchanges of blows between the two countries continue. The sites include Bandar Imam Khomeini petrochemical complex, in Khuzestan Province; the major economic port Bandar Imam Khomeini, adjacent to it; and at the Abadan oil refinery, the refinery for the gas field, called Tange Bijar, in Ilam Province, according to the officials, one of them with Iran’s oil ministry. Hamid Hosseini, an expert on Iran's oil and gas industry and a member of the Iran-Iraq Chamber of Commerce said Israel was sending a clear message to Iran. 'This can have very serious economic consequences for Iran, and now that we understand the stakes we need to act wise and not continue the tensions.' Iranian and Israeli officials told the paper that four Russian S-300 systems were destroyed in addition to those attacked last April when Israel attacked Iran in response to the Iranian missile and drone attack. 'This looks like a potential preamble to a much more effective strike against Iran’s infrastructure and even nuclear sites,' said Ali Vaez, the Iran director of the International Crisis Group. 'Iranians don’t have the capacity to replace these systems in a timely manner, which renders the country much more vulnerable in future tit for tats.' In addition to the aerial defenses, the sources said, the Israeli strike also targeted three large missile production bases: Falagh, Shaid Ghadiri and Abdol Fath, which belong to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and military sites in Parchin and Parand, using drones. While Israeli officials said the attack disrupted Iran's ability to produce missiles, the Iranians said the damage was minimal and production would resume quickly. The Iranian military said four of its soldiers who operated the defense systems were killed. Local media said the number of fatalities was expected to rise. Two of the soldiers were from the city of Mahshahr, near the Bandar Imam Khomeini petrochemical complex. Two Israeli officials said the initial plan of attack, prepared soon after Iran's October 1 ballistic missile strike, included attacks on Iran's energy industry and nuclear program. But the Biden administration urged Israel to avoid those targets, out of concern that they would prompt a severe response that would destabilize the world's economy and drag the United States into a regional war. Iranian officials including Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said repeatedly in interviews and to their Arab counterparts that those targets would be a red flag and if attacked, Iran would respond forcefully. Agraghchi also sent a letter to the UN on Saturday urging the condemnation of Israel and calling its attack 'unlawful and aggressive' and 'against the sovereignty and territorial integrity' of Iran. Iran's military claimed it successfully thwarted most of the Israeli attacks on its air defenses. In a statement the military said Israeli fighter jets did not enter Iran's airspace and fired missiles and drones from the airspace over Iraq. The force also accused the United States of complicity in 'the crime,' while Washington denied taking any part in the attack. Three Israeli officials told the New York Times that command and control sites and a radar, were also targeted. Israel believes those were damaged severely and were put out of use. One of the officials said that satellite images after the attack showed that only the defense systems at the Bandar Imam Khomeini petrochemical complex were hit and not the complex itself. Iran's supreme council met for an emergency session on Sunday and was briefed by military commanders about the damage and the targets that were attacked. Three Iranian officials told the paper that the council discussed how Iran would respond but said no decision was reached. Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei has the authority to order an attack on Israel, in his role as supreme military commander. He is expected to issue a statement later on Sunday.

IDF deception tactics leave Iran weighing its next move	Israeli officials anticipate Iranian response, though specifics remain unclear, while US sources suggest Tehran may hold back; reports indicate high-level discussions in Iran, with its vice president saying response would come 'at appropriate time' Operation Days of Repentance, the Israeli response to Iran’s October 1 ballistic missile attack, targeted advanced Iranian air defense systems and missile production facilities following. According to sources, over 100 aircraft participated, focusing on gaining air superiority for future operations and disrupting Iran’s missile capabilities. Foreign reports indicated that Israel struck critical missile production components, including high-value planetary mixers essential to Iran’s missile program. The operation involved advanced maneuvers and deceptive tactics to enter Iranian airspace, with Israeli forces also targeting anti-aircraft batteries in Syria intended to shield Iranian facilities. Damage assessments are ongoing, with Israeli officials indicating it may take days to determine the full impact. According to opposition-aligned news outlet Iran International, F-35 jets also took part in the elaborate operation. As Tehran weighs its response, assessments of its likely course vary. While senior American officials suggested in comments to Ynet that Iran may hold off on retaliation, Israeli sources expect a response, though the timing remains unknown. According to Reuters, citing two regional sources briefed by Iran, Tehran held high-level meetings to determine the scale of its reaction to the strikes. One source described the damage as 'minimal,' though noted several Revolutionary Guard bases around Tehran were impacted. Iranian Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref, visiting Hamas headquarters in Tehran, issued a warning, saying, 'The aggressor should await a response; we will respond at the appropriate time.' Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking in conversations with Qatari, Saudi and Egyptian counterparts, urged international action to prevent further regional conflict, stressing Iran’s 'unlimited' commitment to its territorial defense. However, he refrained from mentioning a direct act of retaliation. In a statement, Iran’s military confirmed its right to respond but also called for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon, a message AP analysts interpreted as a signal to avoid further escalation. The Iranian military alleged that Israel used U.S.-controlled airspace in Iraq to approach its targets near Tehran and along borders in Ilam and Khuzestan provinces. Several female navigators took part in the overnight sorties, as has been seen in similar operations previously. Major General Aviad Dagan, who is set to assume the role of head of the IDF’s Telecommunications Division, also joined the missions as a navigator. Dagan, a former commander of the Hatzerim Airbase, was among the experienced reservists participating, as more than 60% of the pilots involved in the operation were reserve forces. Israeli sources, meanwhile, indicated the operation struck a significant strategic blow to Iran, reducing its defense capabilities. 'If Iran chooses to respond, it risks a much stronger action, as its defense systems are now severely weakened,' an Israeli official said, adding, 'they are completely exposed.' 'This wasn’t a minor strike; it was a strategic blow and proof that Israel no longer fears Iran,' said another official. 'Israel did not aim for containment but was prepared for escalation, while Iran chose to retreat. The regime is downplaying the attack and may try to spin the narrative, but they know the reality.'

Can Qatar and Egypt’s rivalry drive a breakthrough hostage deal?	Mossad chief set to meet CIA director and Qatari PM in Doha create framework for potential deal; Qatar, noting Cairo’s increased involvement, aims to stay central in talks; US officials believe major breakthrough may only come after US elections Mossad head David Barnea will head to Doha on Sunday to join CIA Director Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed Al Thani for a summit focused on resuming hostage negotiations. The talks aim to reignite discussions on a potential hostage exchange deal, despite U.S. officials reportedly believing that any major agreement would likely be deferred until after the U.S. presidential election in early November. Egyptian intelligence head Hassan Rashad, who met with a Hamas delegation in Cairo over the weekend, is not expected to attend the summit, though Hamas could join the negotiations later. This meeting marks the first in Doha since the August summit and comes after the elimination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza last week, a move Israel saw as removing a major obstacle to a deal. Israeli officials are cautiously optimistic, noting that a restrained Iranian response to Israel’s overnight attacks could shift Hamas’ focus away from regional conflict and back to negotiation. In recent weeks, Israeli and American officials, including Barnea, have coordinated behind the scenes to draft a framework that considers recent shifts in regional dynamics. CIA Director Burns hopes to use this momentum to push for consensus on a renewed framework. A proposed 'mini-deal' from Egypt that would release four hostages in exchange for a temporary two-week ceasefire is also under discussion. Encouraged by various recent developments—including Sinwar's assassination, Hamas’s engagement with Egyptian officials, and Hezbollah’s weakened position—Israel believes the timing is ideal for negotiations. With both Qatar and Egypt vying for influence in facilitating a potential deal, Israel hopes the Doha summit will align the Qatari and Egyptian frameworks into a unified proposal. The summit's outcome may hinge on U.S. pressure on Qatar, which Israel sees as capable of applying strong leverage on Hamas but thus far has refrained from doing so. An Israeli official emphasized that time is critical in resolving the hostage situation, adding, 'We are committed to advancing a deal as quickly as possible.'

Over 100 Israeli aircraft targeted Iran's advanced air defenses, ...	More than 100 Israeli aircraft of various models participated in the overnight strike on Iran, targeting advanced air defense systems, military sources told Ynet Saturday night. The operation aimed to establish aerial superiority, potentially allowing Israeli fighter jets to conduct future low-altitude flights over Tehran, the sources said. Damage assessments from the strikes may take several days, given the scale and complexity of the targets involved. Meanwhile, Israeli forces destroyed anti-aircraft batteries in Syria early Saturday that were reportedly designated to assist Iran’s defenses against air incursions.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sygrqn5eyx	2024-10-26T11:53:52-07:00	
Report: Israel struck Iran’s solid-fuel missile plant, disrupting...	Saudi media reports strike took facility completely offline, destroying around 20 heavy fuel mixers, each worth estimated $2 million; sources familiar with Iran’s missile industry say site will likely require at least 2 years to resume operations Israel targeted an Iranian solid-fuel plant crucial to the production of Kheibar and Qasem ballistic missiles, which were fired at Israel earlier this month, Saudi news site Elaph reported on Saturday, citing an informed source. According to the Saudi news outlet, which often receives security information from Israel, the strike is said to have taken the facility completely offline, destroying around 20 heavy fuel mixers, each worth an estimated $2 million. Sources familiar with Iran’s missile industry told Elaph that the facility will likely require at least two years to resume operations. Solid-fuel missiles, produced using these mixers, allow greater precision and defense advantages by avoiding the need for visible refueling seen with liquid-fuel systems. The solid-fuel propulsion improves both strike accuracy and durability, offering precision within a meter and increasing resilience against interception. Earlier, The New York Times reported that Israel targeted a 'critical component' in Iran’s long-range missile production facilities. Israeli sources described the strike on Iran's surface-to-surface missile production facilities as a 'strategic blow' that would severely hamper Tehran's missile manufacturing capabilities for years to come 'With the added damage to Iran’s air defense systems, the message is clear,' an Israeli official familiar with the strike said Saturday evening, warning that any Iranian retaliation 'risks an even stronger response, with weakened defenses that leave them vulnerable.' Struck with US coordination An official reported that the Israeli strike was coordinated with the United States, targeting missile production sites rather than oil or nuclear facilities, per a U.S. request. 'Both countries agreed on strategic military targets,' the official said, adding that the operation weakened Iran’s missile production and complicated its ability to supply weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine. Despite reports that Arab and European nations issued warnings to Tehran, Israel refrained from notifying Iran ahead of the strike. The operation included three waves targeting surface-to-surface missile factories, a move the official described as a 'strategic blow' and a clear message that 'the fear of Iran has ended.' Iran responded by downplaying the impact, though Israeli officials claim the strike caused severe damage to Iran’s air defenses and ballistic missile capabilities. Another senior Israeli source noted, 'Israel’s intelligence and Air Force operated in Iran as they saw fit, leaving Iran’s leadership to face the new reality.' The official also remarked that while Israeli public opinion often expects dramatic displays, the high level of U.S.-Israeli cooperation on security matters weighed heavily on operational decisions. The Security Cabinet unanimously approved the operation in a one-hour phone meeting, with National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir emphasizing that 'this strike is an opening move against Iran’s strategic assets, a necessary step to counter the Iranian threat to Israel.'

IDF detonates 400 tons of explosives in Hezbollah bunker, rocking...	Built over 15 years, site larger than similar Gaza facilities and held supplies and weaponry to support two battalions; some launch bases may still be undiscovered The IDF on Saturday detonated approximately 400 metric tons of explosives to destroy a major underground Hezbollah facility in Lebanon, reportedly built over the past 15 years. The site, said to be the largest underground Hezbollah base neutralized by Israel to date, was operated by the terrorist group's elite Radwan Force and contained dozens of rooms and armories designed to support as many as two battalions consisting of hundreds of fighters, the IDF said. According to the military, the complex was over 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) long and equipped for extended stays with beds, food, storage units, anti-tank missiles, rockets, RPGs, mines and explosive devices. Forces from the 98th Division, the elite combat engineering Yahalom Unit and other specialized IDF units carried out the operation. At least two Hezbollah operatives were killed, while others reportedly escaped through a tunnel exit leading into the mountainside. The powerful blast triggered minor tremors, measured at a magnitude of 4.5 in northern Israel's Galilee region. To ensure safety during the explosion, Israeli troops were instructed to move about a mile from the blast zone.

Iran’s military alleged on Saturday that Israeli aircraft launched its overnight strike using airspace managed by U.S. forces in Iraq, approximately 60 miles from the Iranian border. The military claimed the strike targeted radar installations in Ilam and Khuzestan provinces, as well as areas near Tehran, causing minimal damage in some locations with repairs ongoing at others. In a statement, Iran condemned the 'violation of international law' and maintained it has the 'legal and legitimate right' to respond. Officials also renewed calls for a lasting cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1jwsjceje	2024-10-26T10:28:12-07:00	
Tehran resumes normalcy after Israeli strikes amid public fears, ...	Iran downplays impact of overnight attack, with state media emphasizing normalcy across capital and country; while some residents scoff at Israel's capabilities, others worried about potential Middle East conflagration Tehran sought to return to normal Saturday following a night of explosions from Israeli airstrikes, which Israel conducted in response to an earlier missile attack against it this month. Iranians returned to work, cafes and the streets as state media downplayed the attack’s impact. Officials emphasized that schools and sports events continued as scheduled. In Tehran’s streets, reactions ranged from indifference to unease over potential escalation with Israel. Some residents, like Houman, 42, who heard explosions while working his night shift, expressed anxiety about being drawn into a broader regional conflict. 'It was an echoing, dreadful sound,' he told AFP. 'There is now a war in the Middle East, and we fear being dragged into it.' Another resident, Moharram, 51, voiced concern that Tehran could face stronger retaliation from Israel if the conflict escalates. Flights over Iranian airspace were briefly halted following the strike but later resumed. Iranian media reassured citizens that Israel caused only 'limited damage,' crediting the Islamic Republic’s air defenses for containing the threat. Throughout the day, Iranian television showed scenes of regular traffic across major cities, stressing that life was carrying on uninterrupted. One broadcast featured residents singing and dancing atop a Tehran building during the strike, taunting Israel. Sepideh, 30, a Tehran insurance manager, described waking up and heading to work as usual. 'War is frightening, but I don’t think it will come to that here,' she told AFP. Another Tehran resident told Reuters, 'War harms ordinary people, and we’re already suffering.' Others conveyed defiance, with resident Hana Avniki saying the limited scale of the strike suggests Israeli caution. 'Some worry about further clashes, inflation and issues piling up—but it hasn’t affected my life yet,' she said, adding, 'If it continues, that will change.' One Tehranian was more direct: 'If by ‘attack’ Israel means last night’s firecrackers that didn’t even wake up anyone in Tehran, that’s their ‘power’—then shame on them.' Another resident dismissed concerns, saying, 'The Israeli regime is doomed, disappearing automatically without any need for an Iranian response.'

Hezbollah fires 125 rockets in 2 hours as IDF seizes launcher tru...	Terror group continues heavy rocket fire on northern Israel, launching 150 rockets since morning as IDF ramps up operations in Lebanon; army reports destroying launcher used in strikes on Majd al-Krum; fire crews tackling multiple blazes Hezbollah launched about 125 rockets toward northern Israel Saturday afternoon, with 150 total launched by 5 p.m., the IDF reported, amid a continued barrage that has persisted despite intensified Israeli operations against the terrorist group. The escalation follows a month of heightened Israeli strikes on Hezbollah positions in Lebanon, particularly since Israel expanded its ground operations in the region. Friday marked the highest daily total of Hezbollah-claimed operations since hostilities began last October, with the group assuming responsibility for 48 separate incidents, a record number. Hezbollah’s rocket, missile and drone attacks have increased in precision and coordination, according to Israeli analysts, moving away from the sporadic strikes seen in September and early October to more strategic targeting intended to achieve both military and psychological impact. However, analysts note that heavy missile fire aimed at central Israel remains limited, possibly due to Israeli strikes on Hezbollah’s launch infrastructure or Iranian orders to hold back larger missiles for potential use in the event of an Israeli attack on Iran. The IDF said approximately 130 Hezbollah launchers were destroyed over the past week, including the one responsible for Friday's deadly strike on the Arab Israeli town of Majd al-Krum. Two civilians, Hassan Sawaed, 21, and Arjwan Manna, 19, were killed, and seven others were injured in that attack. Additionally, the military reported that 91st Division forces located four trucks this week loaded with launchers containing approximately 160 rockets ready for launch. Several fires erupted near She'ar Yashuv, in the Misgav industrial zone and the Hula Nature Reserve due to Saturday’s strikes. Northern District firefighting teams report that the fires have been contained.

Israel targeted ‘critical component’ in Iran’s long-range missile...	New York Times reports Israel's 2nd strike wave in Iran targeted 'critical component' in Tehran's long-range missile production; first wave struck sites in Syria and Iraq, with missile debris later found near Baghdad In the second wave of Israeli airstrikes on Iran overnight, Israel targeted a 'critical component' in Tehran’s long-range missile production process, The New York Times reported on Saturday, citing an Israeli source. While the source did not disclose the specific nature of the targeted component or confirm its destruction, they emphasized it as a uniquely prioritized objective. The report, which corroborates accounts from Arabic media outlets, indicated that Israel's initial strikes focused on air defense systems and radar installations in Syria and Iraq to reduce interception risks. Footage surfaced hours after the strike, showing missile debris near Samarra, north of Baghdad, though it remains unconfirmed if it is linked to Israel. Similar remnants were documented following an April strike in Iraq. Israel's military operations reportedly involved dozens of fighter jets and drones, targeting 20 locations, including military compounds, air defense systems, missile production facilities and ground-to-ground missile launchers in Tehran, as well as Iran’s Khuzestan and Ilam provinces in the west. Iranian sources informed The Times that an S-300 air defense battery positioned at Imam Khomeini International Airport, which protects parts of Tehran, was also struck. They noted that at least three Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps missile bases were damaged. Tehran has since acknowledged that two Iranian soldiers were killed in the strikes, with reports claiming that two additional soldiers died of their injuries hours later. Iranian officials additionally claimed that Israel had succeeded in hitting the Parchin military base, a site near Tehran associated with missile and suicide drone technologies as well as nuclear technology development. One drone reportedly struck the facility while others were intercepted. For over three hours, the Israeli Air Force conducted strikes in three separate waves, targeting military sites, air defense systems and missile production and launch facilities throughout Tehran and western Iran. According to The Wall Street Journal, Israel sent advance warnings to Iran through Arab and European intermediaries. The message outlined Israel’s planned targets and cautioned that any Iranian retaliation would prompt even more forceful Israeli responses. Following the strike, Iran’s Tasnim News Agency indicated that there would be a 'proportionate response' to the Israeli actions. Israeli officials assessed that Iran might retaliate. In a statement, IDF confirmed, 'Intelligence-guided air force strikes targeted missile production sites used by Iran to launch projectiles at Israel in the past year. Additionally, we struck Iranian ground-to-air missile arrays and other air defense capabilities intended to restrict Israel's operational freedom in Iran. The IDF has significant operational capabilities, many of which were exercised today in striking strategic sites deep within Iran. Israel reserves the right and responsibility to protect its citizens should the Iranian regime continue its attacks.' The military added that the scope of damage would become clearer in the coming days but noted the Air Force now has 'greater operational freedom.' With escalated readiness for defense and offense, Israel’s focus remains on the conflicts in Lebanon and Gaza, while remaining vigilant against Iran’s attempts to instigate regional escalation. 'Our ability to strike anywhere in the Middle East has been demonstrated,' the IDF said.

Iran: Israeli strike hit 'secret military base', possibly conduct...	Israeli forces attacked strategic military targets across Iran, including the covert Parchin base near Tehran, known for missile and nuclear technology development; Parchin site had previously been identified by the IAEA for potential nuclear weapon research Beyond Iran's admission of two soldiers killed, including an officer equivalent to the rank of major, Iranian sources informed The New York Times on Saturday afternoon that Israel successfully struck the secret military base at Parchin on the outskirts of Tehran. 'One of the drones hit, while others were shot down,' they claimed. This base, also referred to as a 'security facility' in various reports, is known for developing missile and suicide drone technologies, alongside nuclear technologies. The Israeli strike involved dozens of fighter jets and aircraft, reportedly focusing on 20 different targets. According to the IDF, the operation targeted military complexes, air defense systems, missile production facilities, and ground-to-ground missile launchers in the Tehran province, as well as in the Khuzestan and Ilam provinces in western Iran. Iranian sources also told The New York Times that Israel attacked an S-300 air defense battery stationed at Imam Khomeini International Airport, which provides protection for parts of the Iranian capital. They added that at least three missile bases of the Revolutionary Guards were damaged in this round of Israeli strikes. The Parchin area, located approximately 18 miles east of Tehran, has been a focal point of Iran's military activities. Our analyst, Ron Ben-Yishai, highlights that Iran has previously conducted experiments in this area aimed at enabling the production of nuclear weapons—the nuclear explosive device. While there is no solid information indicating Iran has renewed its efforts to develop a nuclear warhead, if reports of the Parchin facility being attacked are accurate, the goal seems to have been to thwart Tehran's ability to conduct experiments that would advance it in producing a bomb, should it decide to do so. According to foreign reports, this is not the first time Israel has targeted this mysterious Iranian base. In May 2022, an 'incident' was reported there, resulting in the death of engineer Ihsan Gad-Beigi. The New York Times reported then that the facility was attacked by drones. According to the report, quadcopter suicide drones exploded on a 'building of the Iranian Defense Ministry, where research is conducted for the development of drones and unmanned aerial vehicles.' The newspaper noted that the method of operation mirrored previous Israeli strikes, to which Israel declined to comment. A few days after the strike, Iranian military announced that Iranian Chief of Staff Mohammad Bagheri and Iranian Army Commander Abdolrahim Mousavi visited a 'subterranean drone base' whose location was undisclosed. An Iranian state television reporter covering the visit mentioned that the visit took place on a Thursday and involved a 45-minute helicopter flight from Kermanshah in western Iran to the 'secret underground drone facility.' He reported that he was allowed to remove his blindfold only upon arrival at the base, allegedly leaving him unaware of its location. Photographs released by Iranian television showed rows of drones armed with missiles inside a tunnel, reportedly hundreds of meters underground. The base where nuclear ambitions were nurtured In a severe 2011 report by the International Atomic Energy Agency, about four years before the signing of the nuclear agreement, it was noted Iran built a facility at the Parchin military base for conducting hydrodynamic experiments, indicative of potential nuclear weapon development. The base was highlighted as a main focus of Iran's nuclear program, with reports of efforts to simultaneously detonate explosives integral to the bomb mechanism, alongside hydrodynamic experiments related to nuclear weapons development. At Parchin, it was claimed, there exists a special facility where Iranians attempted to develop the explosive casing to encase enriched uranium hemispheres, initiating the nuclear reaction. Ben-Yishai noted that this casing must explode simultaneously with precision measured in nanoseconds, requiring special detonators known as krytrons, which time the explosion and thus initiate the reaction—resulting in a nuclear explosion. In the months following the severe report, assessments and satellite images suggested Iran was cleansing the Parchin site of evidence of military-related nuclear activity. Among other actions, the Institute for Science and International Security revealed satellite images showing a 'pink cover' over a building at the military base, which UN inspectors sought to visit. The cover likely allowed Iran to clean or operate in the facility in a manner that prevented satellite tracking. A Western envoy said at the time that purification activities at Parchin were 'intensifying,' casting doubt on whether IAEA inspectors could find solid evidence there—even if granted access to the military site. It became evident that the Iranians sought to conceal the existence of experiments on the casing and miniaturization of the bomb intended to allow its insertion into the warhead of ballistic missiles. They attempted to remove soil layers in the area to obscure radioactive traces emitted during the use of nuclear materials, and also flushed the area with strong water currents. In fact, only in September 2015, four years after demanding access to the facility, did IAEA officials finally gain entrance—two months after the nuclear agreement was signed with world powers. That said, Iran has numerous underground facilities, some of which have been exposed in recent years. These underground bases typically house various types of drones, alongside missiles and electronic warfare systems, often located at significant depths underground. Additionally, nuclear development sites have been relocated underground following previous strikes. Regarding air bases, according to Al-Jazeera, Iran possesses dozens of air bases spread across its western, eastern, and southern command regions. These bases are associated with either the Iranian Air Force or the Revolutionary Guards and support various military missions.

Iran says two soldiers, one of which was an officer, were killed ...	As the Islamic Republic contemplates whether to respond or swallow their pride, an announcement says two Iranian troops were killed during the Israeli strike; Al-Mayadeen, associated with Hezbollah, says this was 'a win for Iran' On Saturday morning, around 11:00 AM, Iranian military acknowledged two soldiers were killed in the Israeli attack, one of whom held a rank equivalent to a major. Almost simultaneously, Sky News Arabic reported that Iran communicated to Israel, via a third party, that it had no intention of retaliating. If this report is accurate, it suggests that Israel's strategy was effective. This operation was described as a larger-scale response compared to the one Israel launched in April, during which Israeli forces struck central Iran, and Iranian officials claimed no damage was caused. The Wall Street Journal reported that, hours before the attack, Israel sent a warning to Iran through Arab and European intermediaries. This warning detailed the targets Israel intended to strike and indicated any Iranian retaliation would be met with even stronger subsequent attacks. Meanwhile, 'Nour News,' affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guards, stated that 'Tehran’s policy regarding the Israeli attack is to respond without haste. Israeli aggression cannot be ignored.' The Tasnim news agency reported that 'Iran reserves the right to respond to any aggression. Israel will face a proportional response to any action.' Conversely, the Lebanese network 'Al-Mayadeen' claimed, 'The confrontation ended with a victory for Iran. The resistance against Israel has established a new equation in the region.' In the meantime, Iranian Foreign Ministry issued a statement asserting that 'Iran is entitled and committed to defending itself against external aggressive actions.' So far, local media have been broadcasting images of normalcy from various cities across Iran this morning, including Mehrabad International Airport in Tehran, which was reportedly attacked. Iranian networks have mocked the Israeli attack, distributing videos of residents dismissing the threat, as well as a video comparing the Iranian attack on Israel to the Israeli attack on Iran. The only documented evidence of the attack's damage was broadcast by the Qatari channel 'Al-Arabi,' showing the destruction in the city of Shamsabad, south of Tehran, as a result of the Israeli strike. According to reports from media associated with the Iranian opposition, the target was an 'industrial innovation' factory in the city, which might produce drones. Additionally, Iranian sources informed The New York Times that among the sites attacked in Tehran province was an S-300 air defense battery at Imam Khomeini International Airport. According to these sources, this battery provides protection for parts of Iran's capital. They also claimed that at least three missile bases belonging to the Revolutionary Guards were damaged in the Israeli attacks, adding that 'drones attacked the secret military base at Parchin on the outskirts of Tehran. One hit the base, while others were shot down.' Our analyst, Ron Ben-Yishai, highlights that in the Parchin area, Iran has previously conducted experiments intended to enable the production of nuclear weapons—the nuclear explosive device. There is no solid evidence indicating that Iran has resumed efforts to develop a nuclear warhead, but if the reports of the Parchin facility being attacked are accurate, the goal appears to have been to disrupt Tehran's ability to conduct experiments that would advance it in producing a nuclear bomb, should it decide to do so. Officially, Iranian officials remained silent this morning, with Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref merely posting on social media that 'Iran's strength humiliates the enemies of the homeland.' 'Impact comparable to hitting Rafael's missile production line' According to the IDF, during the night, Israel conducted three separate waves of attacks targeting missile production facilities, surface-to-air missile systems, and additional aerial capabilities in Iran. Despite Iranian mockery, Israeli sources asserted that 'Iran is trying to claim that the explosions were due to their successful air defense. This is false. They were a complete failure with zero interceptions.' Israeli assessments suggest that Tehran is expected to respond to the strike, though the nature of this response remains unclear. An Israeli source familiar with the details stated, 'The intelligence provided by the Military Intelligence Directorate in this event is like science fiction, far beyond imagination. The strike precisely targeted factories producing surface-to-surface missiles, ensuring a particularly significant impact on Iran. This is 16-digit precise intelligence (full coordinates) on an irreplaceable factory, with a precise Air Force strike, not near or approximate.' The source added, 'We attacked most of the surface-to-surface missile production capabilities. The goal was to prevent Iran from continuing their production. It's as if someone dismantled Rafael's missile production line.' In preparing for an Iranian response, it is worth noting that the U.S. warned Iran of 'consequences' for such actions and clarified that it was prepared in advance to defend Israel against a potential Iranian retaliation. IDF Spokesperson Brigadier General Daniel Hagari emphasized that Israel still has a 'large target bank' in Iran and will not hesitate to strike if Tehran chooses to attack. By targeting Iran's air defense systems first, and reportedly similar systems in Syria and Iraq, Israel effectively granted its Air Force planes and aircraft operational freedom in Iranian airspace. This knowledge—that Israel can strike Iran again without its defenses—will likely make Tehran reconsider before retaliating.

Two Iranian officials, one of whom is a member of the Revolutionary Guards, told The New York Times that Israel attacked the S-300 air defense system at Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport last night. This system provides protection for certain areas of Iran's capital. According to these sources, at least three missile bases of the Revolutionary Guards were attacked in Tehran. They further stated that in the second wave of Israeli strikes, drones targeted the 'secret military base' in Parchin on the outskirts of Tehran, with one drone hitting the base while others were shot down.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byvtlhcl1l	2024-10-26T03:14:10-07:00	
Washington post: Israel designed attack so Iran could 'deny major...	The American paper says the Israeli attack, made known ahead of time to the Biden administration, was designed to limit civilian casualties and allow the Iranian regime to save face, effectively taking the sting out of a possible response; Arab Sky News says Iran has notified this attack will not elicit another retaliation A source familiar with Israel's plans told the Washington Post on Saturday morning that 'Israel designed its strike with the intention of minimizing casualties and keeping the impact to a level that would allow Iran to deny major damage and contain the situation, according to a person briefed on Israel’s plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified matters.' According to the source, 'This was a larger-scale version of Israel's response in April when Israel struck central Iran, and Iranian officials claimed no significant damage was done.' It's worth noting that after Israel's response to the Iranian attack in April, which National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir even called 'weak,' sparking anger in Israel, Iran did not retaliate—thus effectively closing the chapter until it was reopened with the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Although Israel anticipates some form of response from Iran to last night's attack—which was significantly broader than the one in April—Tehran currently seems to be trying to de-escalate. Only hours after the strike did Iran's military admit that two of its soldiers were killed in the attacks, which focused on Tehran and the Khuzestan and Ilam provinces in the west. Earlier, Iran insisted that the strikes caused 'minimal damage' and that most were intercepted. Sky News in Arabic reported that Iran informed Israel, through a third party, that it would not respond to the attack. Conversely, according to 'Nour News,' affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guards, 'Tehran's policy regarding the Israeli attack is to respond without haste. Israeli aggression cannot be ignored.' Meanwhile, local media broadcast images showing normalcy from various cities across Iran, including Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport, which was reported to have been attacked. Iranian networks mocked the Israeli attack, sharing videos of residents dismissing it, as well as a video comparing the Iranian attack on Israel to the Israeli attack on Iran. While Iranian officials maintained silence this morning, Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref limited his remarks to social media, stating, 'Iran's strength humiliates the enemies of the homeland.' Despite Iran's ridicule, Israeli sources stated that 'Iran is trying to claim that the explosions are due to their successful air defense. That's a lie. They were a complete failure, with zero interceptions.' According to Israeli assessments, Tehran is expected to respond to the attack, though it is still unclear how. An Israeli source familiar with the details said, 'The intelligence provided by the Military Intelligence Directorate in this event is beyond imagination, extremely so. The strike was precise on factories producing surface-to-surface missiles to ensure a significant impact on Iran. This is 16-digit precise intelligence (full coordinates) on an irreplaceable factory, with a precise Air Force strike, not near or approximate.' The source claimed, 'We attacked most of the surface-to-surface missile production capabilities, aiming to prevent Iran from continuing their production. It's as if someone dismantled Rafael's missile production line.' Regarding the anticipation of an Iranian response, it is worth noting that the U.S. warned Iran of 'consequences' for such an action and stated it was prepared in advance to defend Israel against any potential Iranian retaliation. IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari clarified that Israel still has a 'large target bank' in Iran and will not hesitate to strike if Tehran chooses to attack. The decision to first target Iran's air defense systems, reportedly also in Syria and Iraq, effectively allowed Israeli Air Force planes and aircraft free rein in Iranian skies. This knowledge—that Israel can strike Iran again without its defenses—will likely make Tehran think twice before retaliating.

Israeli Air Force strikes in Iran: Exact timeline	Military installations, air defense systems and missile manufacturing facilities were all in the IDF's sights as the attack unfolded overnight; responses from the international community pouring in, the Biden administration was updated ahead of time and details of the attack exemplify military precision About 900 miles from Israel, in the early hours of Saturday, precisely 25 days after Iran's ballistic missile attack, reports of explosions in Iran began to emerge at 2:00 AM, signaling the start of Israel's counterattack. For over three intense hours, across three separate waves, dozens of Israeli Air Force fighter jets and aircraft targeted military complexes, air defense systems, missile production facilities, and surface-to-surface missile launchers in Tehran, as well as in the Khuzestan and Ilam provinces in western Iran. According to the New York Times, 20 different targets were hit, though Tehran downplayed the situation in the morning, given warnings they received from the U.S. against a possible response. The Home Front Command instructions have not changed for now. The first wave began, as mentioned, at 2:00 AM (Israeli time) with reports of explosions in Tehran, as well as in Syria and Iraq, leading to the closure of their airspace. Reports indicated that this wave primarily targeted air defense systems in all three countries, likely to allow Israeli Air Force aircraft the freedom to proceed with their strikes. However, at the time, the situation was unclear: with the sound of explosions, frightened residents in Iran took to the streets, fearing that airports in the Iranian capital might have been hit. Shortly afterward, around 2:30 AM, the IDF spokesperson officially confirmed: 'The IDF is carrying out precise military strikes in Iran, in response to the ongoing attacks by the Iranian regime against the State of Israel in recent months, in accordance with the directive of the political echelon.' IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari stated in an English-language declaration to the foreign media that Israel 'has the right and obligation to respond' to Iran, 'like any other sovereign country in the world.' He noted the strike is a response to months of Iranian actions against Israel since October 7, including those by its proxies. At this stage, the Iranians focused on downplaying the events, with reports from the country stating that the source of the explosion sounds was the air defense systems intercepting the IDF attack. BBC noted shortly afterward that it was unclear which sites were hit in Iran, as Tehran claimed that routine life continued, and Israel did not disclose what it was targeting other than 'military targets.' Around 3:00 AM, it was reported that President Joe Biden was 'closely updated' on the developments. About half an hour later, the Pentagon clarified that the U.S. was not involved in the strike in Iran, although it was informed about it. Israel, in fact, shared with the U.S. what it planned to do and did not surprise it despite Pentagon document leaks. At 4:15 AM, further reports indicated that President Biden and Vice President Harris were updated on the attack. Despite this, until almost 4:00 AM, global media continued to report it was still unclear what was hit and where, also noting Syria reported Israeli airstrikes hitting military sites in its center and south. Then, reports of another wave of attacks in Iran surfaced, along with footage of interception attempts in the skies. In this wave, Israel hit Iranian surface-to-surface missile production facilities, with an informed Israeli source stating, 'The intelligence provided by the Military Intelligence Directorate in this event is science fiction beyond all imagination. The hit on factories producing surface-to-surface missiles was precise, to ensure significant impact. This is 16-digit precise intelligence (full coordinates) on an irreplaceable factory, with a precise Air Force strike, neither near nor approximate.' Meanwhile, as pilots were still in enemy territory, offices of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant began releasing photos of them in the Operations Directorate's command bunker. The New York Times reported that the strikes in the additional wave concluded about half an hour after they began, around 5:00 AM, targeting air defense systems, missile production facilities, UAVs, and launch sites. 'If Iran makes a mistake - we will respond.' At 6:00 AM, IDF announced that the Air Force jets had returned safely to the country after striking air defense systems and surface-to-surface missiles in Iran, stating that the operation was named 'Days of Repentance.' According to the official IDF statement, 'Air Force jets attacked, with intelligence guidance, missile production means that Iran launched toward the State of Israel in the past year. Simultaneously, surface-to-air missile arrays and additional aerial capabilities of Iran were attacked, which were intended to limit Israel's aerial freedom of action in Iran. IDF has many offensive operational capabilities, some of which were carried out today in striking strategic arrays deep within Iran. The State of Israel reserves the right and duty to protect its citizens if the Iranian regime continues its attacks against Israel and its citizens.' 'The extent of the damages and results will be revealed later, but already there is broader freedom of action for the IDF,' they said. 'We are focused on the objectives of the war in Lebanon and Gaza, and Iran is pushing for regional escalation. We are at peak readiness in defense and offense, with no change in the Home Front Command instructions at the moment. We are in ongoing intelligence and operational assessment. We have proven that we can strike at any point in the Middle East.' About 20 minutes after the IDF's announcement, in a conversation with reporters, a senior White House official stated the U.S. fully backs Israel and warns Iran of 'consequences' if it responds to the IDF strike — which was defined as 'self-defense.' According to the official, 'We deployed a missile battery and acted to strengthen Israel's air defense systems in anticipation of tonight's response. President Biden and Vice President Harris have clearly demonstrated that we will always help protect Israel from Iran and its terrorist organizations.' However, in Israel, it is estimated that Iran will respond. After attempting throughout the night to downplay the results of the strikes, at 6:30 AM, it admitted for the first time that 'minimal damage' was caused at several sites, but emphasized that its air defense systems successfully confronted 'Israeli aggression.'

Bereaved families left to cope with immense loss after 13 IDF tro...	Ground incursions into southern Lebanon have began taking an immense toll, as no less than 13 troops have lost in their lives in less than two days, leaving shattered families behind, left to pick up the pieces; 'How do you process something like this? I need you more than ever,' said the daughter of a fallen soldier During the Simchat Torah holiday, while many celebrated across the country, 20 children were left fatherless, all perishing in battles in southern Lebanon. These children, aged between 4 and 17, faced the profound loss of a parent at an early stage in their lives. In the clashes in southern Lebanon during Simchat Torah, 10 soldiers were killed, six of whom were parents. Shlomo Aviad Naiman, 31, left behind four children: Haggai (12), Tzuriya (9), Carmi (8), and Rafael (4). Mordechai Chaim Amoyal, 42, left behind six children. Shmuel Harari, 35, left behind three children. Guy Idan left behind two daughters, Libi (17) and Avishag (13). Dan Maury, 43, left behind two sons. Omri Lotan, 47, left behind two daughters and a son, Mika, Gaya, and Amit. Aside from the tragic addition of many orphans to the circle of bereavement in just one day, October 2024 has been the most challenging month in the conflict since December 2023, when 114 people were killed. In fact, this month has been the deadliest in the war since the beginning of the year, with 69 fatalities from operational activities, rocket, and UAV attacks, and terrorist incidents. Since the start of the ground maneuver in Lebanon about a month ago, on September 30, 27 soldiers have been killed, 5 of them in the last 24 hours. Guy Idan was laid to rest: 'You are the salt of the earth, my beloved son' On Friday, in the military section of the cemetery at Kibbutz Shomrat, Sgt. Major (Res.) Guy Idan, a 51-year-old resident of the kibbutz, was laid to rest. He was killed on Thursday by a projectile explosion near a structure in the central sector of southern Lebanon. 'If there is a definition for the term ‘salt of the earth,’ it’s you, my beloved son,' eulogized his father, Yigal. His 17-year-old daughter, Libi Idan, added, 'How do you process something like this? I need you more than ever.' Guy’s father described him as someone who was 'always giving and doing for everyone,' and recounted how he refused to forgo volunteering for reserve duty. Guy’s mother, Rachel Sela, eulogized him as well, describing him as 'a great man with an even greater heart, always volunteering and giving of himself.' She recalled the moment he left for reserves and how she asked him 'not to be a hero,' adding, 'I never thought something would happen to you. I can’t and don’t want to believe it. I am in a nightmare.' Guy Idan was the cousin of Tzachi Idan, who was abducted from his home in Nahal Oz on October 7. 'He will no longer see him return from captivity in Gaza,' wrote a family member. The family said that Guy did everything he could to bring back the abductees, both as a civilian and in the army. Amir, Guy’s brother and Tzachi’s cousin, told Ynet that 'Guy was a very special person, a redhead as a redhead should be. He always loved the army and security. In Kibbutz Shomrat, he established the standby squad to perfection, instilling a sense of security for all the residents. They called him for everything, even when it wasn’t his role because they knew they could rely on him. As a younger brother, I knew I had someone to rely on for everything; he always protected me and always delivered.' 'The world has lost one of its best sons': Mordechai Amoyal was laid to rest On Friday, Sgt. Major (Res.) Mordechai Haim Amoyal (42), a resident of Lod who fell in the battles in southern Lebanon during Simchat Torah, was laid to rest on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. Mordechai is survived by his wife Rina and six children. 'How I dreaded being in this place. Since the beginning of the war, I have watched in awe as courageous women eulogized their husbands, what strength and power,' Rina said. 'The world has lost one of its best sons today. What a man you were, what presence, always at the forefront.' She described how 'you were always preoccupied with living a meaningful life. You always aspired higher, and since October 7, you didn’t have time to beat yourself up for not going south. You were a person full of depth, aspiring to the most meaningful life possible, never settling in one place. You were the best partner I could have asked for, the most attentive, the most loving, the closest. You were an amazing and diligent father to our children, a prankster, and a child at heart.' She addressed her children, who were left without their father, saying, 'It’s important for me that you know, kids, that Dad was proud of you, and there is so much of him in each of you. Everywhere you went, you were loved and significant. I want to say thank you for all the good we had together, for making me feel like a queen, for who you are.' His daughter Shira spoke over her father’s fresh grave, saying, 'You always tried to give more and more, asking what would make me come to more classes, trying to think of creative ideas to ignite our passion for Torah. You always said I didn’t have to study at school but to do something with my time—because that was you. You used every minute, listened to lessons on headphones every moment, never wasted a minute, maybe you understood even then that you need to make the most of every minute? Your connection to us as a family was important to you; you wanted to play, travel—because that was you.' His daughter Ayana also eulogized, saying, 'My dad, I remember he was always there for me. He was loved and beloved, he was always there for us. I already miss you, Dad.' His young son added, 'I remember your last visit home, how proud you were of us for building the sukkah by ourselves, just as you were proud last year when we dismantled it ourselves. Thank you for everything, Dad.' Shlomo was laid to rest: 'It’s hard to imagine life without you' On Friday, Sgt. 1st Class (Res.) Shlomo Aviad Naiman (31) from Mitzpe Yeriho was laid to rest on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. He is survived by his parents, 12 siblings, his wife Shir, and four children. 'I can’t believe this really happened to us. We have so many dreams yet to fulfill together. A man of dreams, a man of vision. Our home, which you worked so hard to build and still haven’t finished,' eulogized his wife. 'Our beloved children who need you so much. And I, who don’t know what life is without you. We’ve been together since I was 16. I knew from the start you were mine and I was yours.' His brother Amichai added, 'It’s hard to imagine life without you. You always jumped to volunteer for every task, and everything was always done with joy. In the office, he was defined as the COO, but in practice, he was everything no one else would do, no matter what the task was. For him, the motto was to do what was needed, quietly.' He said, 'We promise to continue your kindness, desires, aspirations, and dreams—with lots of positive activity, charity, and kindness. We will take care of your heroic wife Shir and the children.' Yehudit, his sister, eulogized, saying, 'On the eve of the holiday, I sat in the sukkah and felt something bad. I thought it was a feeling you get after what we all went through last year. I wrote about it on my phone, and today I saw it was exactly at five, when we parted from you. I realized that’s what it feels like to lose a brother. How will the world go on without you? I know you did it because you are invincible. We are an unbeatable nation, thanks to you and all the heroes.'

Explosions in Lebanon prompt false earthquake alerts in northern ...	Shortly after IAF jets return from Iran, residents all over the north receive a series of alerts on their phones, warning of an impending earthquake; IDF Spokesperson clarifies it was brought on by a series of controlled explosions in southern Lebanon In the early hours of Saturday, shortly after a sequence of strikes in Iran by the Israeli Air Force, an unusual flurry of earthquake warnings jolted residents across dozens of locales in the Golan Heights, Haifa, and surrounding communities. People recounted receiving urgent messages on their mobile devices, with some in Haifa noting alerts instructing them to reach safety within a mere minute. This wave of alerts wasn't due to natural tectonic shifts but rather the result of a significant, controlled blast in Lebanon. The Geological Survey of Israel clarified, 'The earthquake warnings were set off by a considerable, controlled explosion that took place this morning in the north. Our alert system mistook the explosion for seismic activity, hence the widespread notifications.' IDF spokesperson reassured the public, stating unequivocally that this was not a security breach. 'In recent minutes, explosive sounds have echoed across northern Israel, a byproduct of IDF operations in southern Lebanon. There is no cause for security concerns,' the statement read. Golan Regional Council informed its residents, 'Israeli forces neutralized an enemy compound, and following the detonation of a vast amount of explosives in Lebanon, earthquake alerts were activated across wide areas of the country. No changes in safety guidelines are necessary.' A Haifa local shared with Ynet, 'My phone warned of an earthquake, but nothing happened. We all went outside as instructed, yet no quake occurred.' Another resident remarked, 'We've grown accustomed to waking up at 7 AM to missile alerts. Suddenly, an earthquake alert blared from the app. It was terrifying.' The alerts sparked anxiety among residents, given the longstanding belief that a major earthquake is due in Israel. It is generally thought that Israel experiences a significant quake roughly every century, with the last one striking 96 years ago. In 2012, Israel felt one of its strongest earthquakes in two decades. With a magnitude of 5.3, its epicenter lay southeast of Cyprus, and tremors were felt across northern, central, and eastern parts of Israel. Only two instances have seen stronger quakes in the vicinity, both with epicenters further away from Israel. In 1995, a 6.2 magnitude quake shook the Red Sea, about 90 miles south of Eilat, causing road cracks in the city. Last year, a 5.9 magnitude tremor originating from Crete was felt in Israel and neighboring countries. A somewhat less powerful quake occurred in 2008, registering at 5.3 magnitude. Its epicenter was near Tyre in Lebanon, yet it was distinctly felt throughout most of Israel. The last earthquake to cause tangible damage in Israel struck eight years ago. In February 2004, a 5.1 magnitude quake shook the Dead Sea region, leading to partial collapses of several buildings and an evacuation of the government complex. These moderate-intensity tremors have so far spared the population from casualties, but a slightly stronger quake could alter this reality dramatically. In 1956, around 150 people perished in a quake in Mount Shouf, Lebanon. The 1927 quake, with a magnitude of 6.2, wreaked havoc and claimed numerous lives in what was then a sparsely populated region. More than 300 people were killed in what was then Palestine, and about a thousand homes were destroyed. Cities like Nablus, Tiberias, Ramla, and Lod faced prolonged rehabilitation. In the 19th century, the most devastating earthquake struck in 1837. Thousands perished in Safed alone, Tiberias’s city walls crumbled, and massive waves battered the shores of the Sea of Galilee. The tremors also impacted Jericho and Jaffa, not sparing the northern regions alone. The belief that a significant quake hits Israel approximately every 100 years is supported by historical events. Nearly a century prior, in 1759, a colossal quake struck, killing thousands in Lebanon and affecting Tiberias and Acre. Estimates from that time suggest around 200 fatalities occurred in Safed.

Iran: Claim that 100 Israeli jets attacked us is false, refinery ...	A source claimed in a report by the Iranian news agency 'Tasnim' that the Israeli attack in Iran was conducted from outside the country's borders and caused limited damage. The source stated, 'The Israeli claim that 20 sites were attacked is unrealistic and is part of psychological warfare.' The source reiterated that no Revolutionary Guard military facility was targeted and that the report of 100 aircraft participating in the attack is 'false and intended to exaggerate the weak strike.' The agency also quoted the Tehran refinery: 'We deny that the refinery was a target in the attack. It is operating as usual.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjf9uw5ekx	2024-10-25T23:06:10-07:00	
U.S. satisfied after Israeli Iran strike, warns Tehran of consequ...	A White House official speaking to reporters after the strike says the administration urged Israel to carry out a precise, targeted strike that would deter Iran from further attacks and avoid regional escalation A senior White House official on Saturday said that the Biden administration worked with Israeli leaders in recent weeks to encourage them to carry out a precise and proportionate strike on Iran with minimum risk to civilian casualties, in retaliation for the Iranian ballistic missile attack on Israel earlier this month. The Israeli strike 'was extensive, it was targeted, it was precise,' he said. Israel launched a three-hour strike on Iranian military targets around the country, outside populated areas. According to the IDF, the military targeted 'missile manufacturing facilities, surface-to-air missile arrays and additional Iranian aerial capabilities.' The official who spoke to reporters after the Israeli strike ended, said U.S. President Joe Biden discussed the situation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week and encouraged him to plan an attack that would deter further Iranian strikes against Israel while reducing the chance for further escalation. He said that was the goal of both the U.S. and Israel. The official mentioned the U.S. deployment of the THAAD missile defense system to Israel, to protect against Iranian missiles and said that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have proven that they would always come to the defense of Israel against Iran and its terrorist proxies. He said that if Iran chose to respond once again, 'We will be ready and there will be consequences on Iran.' However, he added, the administration does not want to see that happen.

Magen David Adom says 2 men aged 2 were critically injured, and an 80-year-old man sustained serious injuries; IDF reports over 30 rockets launched in the barrage At least 8 people were injured, 2 critically in Majd al-Krum as a result of a Hezbollah rocket attack, the Magen David Adom (MDA) reported on Friday. According to MDA, two young men, aged 21, were critically injured, while an 80-year-old man sustained serious injuries. MDA teams are transporting the injured to the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya, along with several others wounded by shrapnel. The Hezbollah terrorist organization claimed responsibility for 'a large-scale barrage of fire' directed at Karmiel and the surrounding area. The IDF Spokesperson's Unit reported that some 30 rockets were launched from Lebanon toward the Karmiel and Upper Galilee area, with some intercepted.

Mission accomplished IDF says after attack on Iran	Military says all planes return safely after three-hour-long strike reportedly targeting missile production sites, surface-to-air missile arrays, other Iranian aerial capabilities; IDF warns Iran not to respond Israel on Saturday completed a three-hour-long strike on Iran, 25 days after an Iranian ballistic missile attack on Israel on October 1. The military said all Israeli aircraft returned safely to their base after the mission was completed and its objectives reached. Some 20 sites were attacked, according to a report in the New York Times. 'The strike was conducted in response to the attacks by the Iranian regime against the State of Israel and its citizens in recent months. The retaliatory strike has been completed and the mission was fulfilled,' the IDF said. Spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel demonstrated the capabilities and the resolve to act in defense of the country and warned that if Iran were to continue its attacks and the escalation of violence in the region Israel would respond. In a written statement the military said that based on intelligence, IAF aircraft struck missile manufacturing facilities used to produce the missiles. 'These missiles posed a direct and immediate threat to the citizens of the State of Israel. Simultaneously, the IDF struck surface-to-air missile arrays and additional Iranian aerial capabilities, that were intended to restrict Israel's aerial freedom of operation in Iran. Israel avoided attacking targets that could drag the region into an all-out war including Iran's oil production and nuclear sites. Dozens of aircraft participated in the attack that was carried out at a distance of 1,600 kilometers (994 miles) from Israel's borders and in several areas of Iran. 'The extend of the damage and the results of the strikes will become known later but as of now, the IDF has a wider range of freedom to operate,' military sources said adding that Israel still has targets it can strike in the future. 'We are now focused on the war in Gaza and Lebanon and Iran has been pushing for regional escalation,' the sources said. 'We are on full alert in our defensive and offensive capabilities and there are no changes to Homefront instructions to the public. We are continuing our intelligence and operational assessments. We've proven we can attack anywhere in the Middle East.' Iran confirmed that damage was caused by the Israeli attacks but claimed it was limited. Iran's air defenses said Israel attacked military sites in Tehran Province as well as in the provinces of Khuzestan and Ilam in the west of the country. A White House official expressed home that Iran would not retaliate for the Israeli strike and threatened 'consequences' if it does. This should be the end of the direct exchange of fire between the two countries, the official said, adding that the U.S. has multiple direct and indirect channels of communication with Iran where it has made its position clear.

Iran threatens retaliation for Israel's strike	Iranian news agency sites sources saying there is no doubt Israel will face a proportional reaction to the strikes; earlier Khamenei reportedly instructed his military to prepare for war against Israel Iran is prepared to respond to any Israeli 'aggression', Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency said on Saturday, citing sources. 'There is no doubt that Israel will face a proportional reaction for any action it takes,' Tasnim quoted the sources as saying. Israel launched strikes on Iran early on Saturday targeting military bases including ballistic missile sites, weapons storage facilities and air defenses according to reports in waves of attacks estimated to continue for hours. According to a report in the New York times late on Thursday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ai Khamenei instructed his military to prepare for war against Israel but the paper added that if the Israeli attack would be limited, Iran may not respond. Israel's attacks came in retaliation for an Iranian ballistic missile attack on October 1. Israel was expected to launch attacks on Iran and was considering its targets in coordination with the United States. The U.S. urged Israel to avoid leading to a regional war by refraining from attack son Iran's nuclear facilities or its oil production. Sources, two of them identified as members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) told the Times that an Israeli strike that would cause substantial damage could be responded to by a barrage of up to 1,000 ballistic missiles; escalated attacks by Iranian proxies in the region; and disrupting the flow of global energy supplies and maritime traffic through the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz.

Tehran downplays Israeli strike claiming not significant damage	This could be seen as an effort to avoid the need to retaliate; local TV network claims airports are operating normally and there have been no incidents that 'require intervention.' Iran claims explosions heard in its cities were caused by its own air defenses, while an Israeli strike was underway early on Saturday against Iranian military sites. 'This is a lie,' an Israeli official said. 'There have been no intercepts.' Iranian television reported that both its international airports were operating normally and showed images of Tehran's sky devoid of any smoke or sign of explosions. The network said there have been no incidents that 'require intervention.' A correspondent for the network said that there were Israeli attempts to attack three bases in the Tehran Province but the air defenses thwarted the attack. This can be seen as an Iranian effort to avoid the need to launch a retaliatory strike against Israel. According to a report in the New York Times late on Thursday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei instructed his military to prepare for war against Israel but added that if the strike is not a significant one, there may not be a response.

It was so loud and the sky became red,' an eye witness tells Iranian semi-official TV; reports of explosions also in the area of Damascus | This is a breaking story Israel began its attack against Iran early Saturday morning local time in retaliation for its massive ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1, two sources with knowledge told Axios. Several loud explosions were heard in Iran's capital Tehran and the nearby city of Karaj city, Iranian media said, adding that the cause was unknown. There was no official comment about the source of the explosions. Witnesses in Tehran confirmed hearing loud explosions. 'It was so loud and the sky became red,' said an Iranian resident in Tehran, who asked not to be named. Explosions were also heard in the Damascus countryside and central region, according to Syrian state TV. Israel has been planning a response to a ballistic missile attack carried out by Iran on Oct. 1, Tehran's second direct attack on Israel in six months. Iranian authorities have warned Israel against launching an attack, saying any strike on Iran would be met with a stronger retaliation.

We thought we were the only ones developing drones, we weren't p...	UAVs have become Hezbollah's effective attack weapon in the war, causing deaths, injuries, heavy damage, and quite a bit of a headache for the Israeli Air Force; How did these simple drones manage to evade Israel’s sophisticated air defense systems? And how did Israel overlook this threat all these years? Before reporting to military reserve duty, Refael Kauders and his wife Judith went on a weekend to celebrate their wedding anniversary. They had a lot to celebrate: four lovely children, a house in Tzur Hadassah, great love. The 39-year-old Kauders, who served as religion and tradition coordinator of the 5030th Infantry Battalion, did not have to report to reserves duty, but he was determined to contribute his share. Upon his return from the weekend, Kauders set out for the Druze town of Hurfeish, where he and his fellow reservists in the infantry battalion were busy setting up the camp, near a soccer field. Some soldiers in the battalion thought it was dangerous to set up a camp in such an exposed area, near the Lebanon border, arguing that 'staying there endangers the lives of dozens of soldiers', but the location of the camp was not changed. On Wednesday, June 5, afternoon, Hezbollah experimented with a new method of attack, launching two suicide drones toward the Horfeish area in the upper Galilee. It is not clear yet whether Hezbollah had advance information on the whereabouts of the soldiers, or if the drone operators were simply looking for targets and found them. Either way, the crossing of the drones was not identified, and no warning alarm was triggered. One drone exploded on the soccer field, and the second continued to hover in the air for a few more minutes, waiting for rescue forces to rush to the scene of the first explosion, and then it exploded as well. Staff Sergeant (res.) Kauders was killed, and 12 were injured, including a female soldier who was seriously injured. 'We felt like ducks on a shooting range,' said a reservist from the battalion who survived the attack. The UAVs again took a bloody toll. The IDF announced that a thorough investigation will be carried out and lessons will be learned, but Hizki Bezalel, the brother-in-law of the late Kauders is troubled. Since the disaster, he began to explore UAVs, trying to understand why Israel was not able to deal with them. 'It upsets me that a device that costs about $2,000 causes us more trouble than all the expensive weapons, and we continue to get equipped with F-35 and the Air Force refuses to listen,' he said this week. 'The army is reluctant to consider a cheap solution. Instead, they prefer to develop expensive and sophisticated weapons. The problem is that senior military officials are unwilling to consider non-prestigious solutions. After all, no F-35 can handle a strike of a hundred UAVs launched simultaneously. We are not angry, we just want them to learn a lesson. They should conclude and understand that reality has changed. They just need to understand how the UAVs work, and whether there are solutions available. To this day our case has not been investigated.' Since October 7, Hezbollah alone has launched about 2,000 unmanned aerial vehicles into Israeli territory. Iran, the Houthis, and the Shiite militias in both Syria and Iraq are also trying to send UAVs. There are no official figures on how many of them hit their targets, but at least eight Israelis were killed in drone attacks and many dozens were injured. The property damage cannot yet be estimated, and it is certainly impossible to set a price tag for all the times that drones urged Israelis to run for shelter or disrupted the course of their life. The late Mikhail Samara from Kafr Yasif was the last person killed (until the publication of this article) by a Hezbollah drone, as he was hit by an IDF intercepting rocket that missed the drone in the Nahariya area. In the same Hezbollah drone attack, 19 people were injured, including six soldiers. Before Samara, drones also claimed the lives of the late Yevgeny Ferder, who was killed by a Houthi drone strike that hit his apartment in Tel Aviv; the late Major Dor Zimel, who was killed by a drone strike on a building in Arab al-Aramshe, where his department stayed; Command Sergeant Major (Res.) Yehezkel Azaria, who was killed by a hit near Margaliot community in the north; Major (Res.) Dan Kamhaji, and Staff-Sergeant-Major (Res.) Nachman Nathan Hertz who was killed by a hit near Metula; and Master Sergeant (Res.) Valeri Chefonov, who was killed by a drone attack on Kibbutz Kabri. While the Iron Dome systems, David's Sling, and the Arrow missiles provide broad protection - although it is not airtight - a small, slow, often unsophisticated vehicle has become a major threat, especially in the north. Indications that UAVs were becoming a weapon that must be addressed were here long before the October 7 massacre. Why didn't it happen? As usual, it depends on who you ask. The bottom line, Israel's security system is trying while under fire to find solutions for that threat. 'The professional challenge is great, but it had to be prioritized' UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) is a general name for all aircraft that do not include a human pilot onboard. Some drones can be purchased cheaply online and armed, and there are larger drones, such as Hermes and Eitan, operated by the Israeli Air Force or the Americans. The benefits of the UAVs are clear: they are usually smaller, cheaper, and simpler to operate than a fighter aircraft; they can be easily adapted to a variety of purposes, and the simpler models do not require a complicated operation, or complex technical setup, airports, or pilots. Having a good and advanced air force is complicated and can be maintained by wealthy countries that have technological capabilities. In contrast, UAVs have also allowed terrorist organizations to establish their aerial threats. Hezbollah began using Iranian-made UAVs in the early 2000s. Their first attack was modest: almost 20 years ago, in November 2004, Hezbollah's first UAV entered Israel's airspace without being detected, hovered for several minutes above Nahariya in the north, turned to the sea, and then fell. Over the years, there were more infiltrations by Hezbollah drones, also in the Second Lebanon War in 2006, but they were usually intercepted. In the meantime, Hezbollah accumulated more and more Iranian drones of various types and established a special drone division, called Unit 127, which engaged in developing their flying capabilities. Israel followed these developments closely, sand sometimes reacted - in December 2022 Israel bombed Uthe nit 127 facility in Lebanon, for example - but somehow, Israel underestimated the potential of the threat. Among the mass of urgent tasks in the north, such as combating Hezbollah's missile precision project and preventing Iranian entrenchment in Syria, the UAVs were not Israel's top priority. This was, of course, a mistake. The war that is taking place in Ukraine, almost 2,000 km from here, should have been a warning signal. At the beginning of last year, Russia and Iran signed a huge deal for the purchase of UAVs. Iran has supplied Russia with drones 'Shahed 131' and 'Shahed 136', both suicide drones, which are a cheap alternative to the expensive Russian missiles, which have been running out. These are relatively 'dumb' aircraft, but the Ukrainians learned very quickly how deadly they were. Hezbollah is also equipped with these two types of 'Shahed', in addition to several other types of drones. The terrorist organization currently uses mainly suicide drones and intelligence-gathering drones and recently released videos documenting drone flights over Haifa port and onsite security facility in Haifa Bay. Moreover, Hezbollah also has Iranian attack drones of the 'Karar' type ', which can carry bombs or missiles, launch them, and return to their base, or launch them and then crash themselves on the target. The Iranian attacking drones do not have the sophistication and accuracy of Israel's UAVs, and still, if Hezbollah decides to use them, it could cause great damage. 'The fact that we reached October 7 without an adequate response to the threat of UAVs is a failure of the Ministry of Defense along with the air defense system,' says a source familiar with the UAV world. 'They should have seen what was happening in Ukraine and adapted it to the Israeli reality. We did not react quickly enough to the threat. One could have realized that once the Russians used it in Ukraine, bearing in mind that the Iranians are their allies, at some point, it will reach us - and we should have created a response to it. Unfortunately, it did not happen.' Why not? 'Officials I talk to claim that budgetary constraints forced them to equip with less good systems, especially radar systems. The sooner UAVs are identified, the chances are to intercept them. Currently, IAI's radar production time is long. The second problem is that some of the existing radars are positioned at high altitudes aimed to detect missiles, but UAVs fly at a different angle relative to the radar system. The Iron Dome, for example, underwent adjustments for UAVs and improved its detection capabilities, but it does not provide an airtight solution. The third point is that Israel is currently facing many fronts, about seven. And still, this is not the security system's biggest nightmare.' What is its biggest nightmare? 'A 'swarm' drone attack. It could cause damage to air force bases and strategic facilities.' Brigadier General Ran Kochav, former commander of the air defense system between 2018-2021, admits that 'the Israeli Air Force has determined that UAVs were not an existential threat, and therefore was a second priority,' but he also states that 'I'm not sorry about that.' Why? 'Because it was necessary to prioritize. The aerial defense is not perfect, but on April 14 (the night of the first Iranian attack) and in October, the defense was excellent. UAVs pose a great challenge. There are many types of drones: fuel-powered, electric-powered, remotely controlled, one-way drones, such as suicide UAVs, attacking drones, and drones used for taking pictures. A UAV that flies from Iran is not similar to a drone that flies from Marjayoun in south Lebanon to Metula in the north of Israel. UAVs are not characterized only by their variety but also by their quantity. They are inexpensive and therefore replaced the rockets. Our enemy realized that the air defense system can cope well with rockets and missiles, so it began sending swarms of drones.' Quite a few claim that the problem, as seen in the war in Ukraine, was right in front of us, but we failed to realize it was coming our way, and we didn't prepare ourselves 'It's not true that we didn't look at the Russians in Ukraine. Operations teams that studied the war there concluded that it was a challenging threat but not an existential one and that it did a lot of psychological damage, and we had to deal with it. Technologically speaking it's difficult to handle it because the UAV is very simple. It causes great damage, but it's not scientifically complicated. We were not prepared for UAVs in the Iron Sword war because it wasn't a top priority. We needed to buy another tank, a submarine, and an iron dome, so we prioritized. Imagine what would have happened if we had set a different priority, and instead of thousands of rocket interceptors we had thousands of UAV interceptors - rockets would have killed more. We need both. It generated a perception of the 'absurdity of success'.' What does 'absurdity of success' mean? 'Since the success of the Iron Dome, David's Sling and Arrow 2 and 3 systems is so great, an 'absurdity of success' perception is generated. The public praises us for our achievements, but he does not forgive us in terms of the drone attacks, where the success rate was 'only' 75% and not 95%. I hear terms like 'failure', 'scandal' or 'how could this happen?', which do not reflect reality.' Can you talk to me in numbers? 'In this war, the number of rocket and missile interceptions was of 4-digits, and by the time this article is published there will be another 200, these are huge amounts. In terms of UAVs and other flying objects, the interceptions are 3-digits.' 'Things keep changing' The main problem, as mentioned, is that UAVs are difficult to detect. The Israeli radar systems are very advanced, but they know how to detect planes, missiles, and even rockets of a certain size. That's what they were designed for, as this was the main threat. But UAVs, especially the smallest ones, are slow speed, flying at low altitudes deep inside valleys in the Galilee, and since Hezbollah launches them near the border, there is not enough time left to detect them, while they dive toward their targets. Their size is very confusing, and they are also made of a variety of materials. In the first months of the war, there were cases where the Iron Dome radar detected a UAV threat in the north which turned out to be innocent migrating cranes, says an officer involved in the production of radars. 'It happened that we shot at flocks of cranes mistakenly identified as aircraft infiltration, and we launched Iron Domes and David's sling interceptors.' 'Our main problem is detection because when we don't see, we don't shoot', says Brigadier General (res.) Kochav. 'It is difficult to detect UAVs because they fly below the radar and leave a low radar signature. They do not have much metal, so a radar designed to detect an aircraft by its metal, fails to identify the drone, and if you lower the sensitivity of the radar, then many false alarms are triggered. Therefore, the main challenge is detection. It is possible to detect them by observation, or by acoustic radars, as was done in World War II, or using electronic warfare by receiving GPS signals, but it's very difficult', he adds. 'Furthermore, we may detect the drone, but it will be hard to follow it because it flies slowly compared to a rocket or an airplane. And if we've already managed to track it, it's not certain that we'll be able to launch a fighter plane to intercept it, bearing in mind that air defense systems are not deployed everywhere. Besides, we might not even know whose drone it is.' What do you mean? 'If a rocket is launched at you, for example, it must be the enemy's. But how can you tell whom a drone or another flying device belongs to? It might belong to Metula's standby security squad. Moreover, regulation issues also pose a problem. Any child can buy a drone and equip it with explosives. I'm not trying to make excuses. The result is not good enough. We need 100 percent success, but because Iron Dome's success rate is 95% or more, then 75% is not acceptable.' It's maybe 75% now. But what will happen in the event of a swarm attack of dozens, maybe hundreds of UAVs simultaneously launched toward a certain target? Does this sound like an extreme scenario? 'In my view, an extreme scenario would involve a simultaneous attack, by Hezbollah, Syria, Iran, and Yemen, launching both cruise and surface-to-surface missiles and flying devices, using different methods, some electric, some motorized, some armed, some precise. This may sound like a far-fetched scenario, but I can't say 'This will never happen'. There is no perfect airtight defense, and there is no solution available for every scenario. However, our air defense system is one of the best in the world, and if citizens are under attack, they'd better be here than in Beirut, Damascus, or Tehran. Is this an existential threat? No. Also, dozens of drones do not pose an existential threat. It's not good when such an aircraft crashes in Tel Aviv. But let's calm down.' Prof. Daniel Weihs, Head of the Autonomous Systems and Robotics Program at the Technion, has been eating, breathing, and planning drones for 50 years. And yet, he admits that he too only recently realized the potential of the threat. 'No one, including me, thought they could use it against us. Only in the last few months did I realize it, as it started to become real and not just an episode.' So, what do we do? 'I know that now they are working frantically to find solutions, including those that I can't disclose. We are a country that has developed drones and UAVs more than any other country, the problem is that we thought we were the only ones doing it, and we did not prepare ourselves for an attack.' In the meantime, the security system does not have a complete solution for UAVs, certainly not at the level of the Iron Dome system. Dr. Liran Antebi, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies INSS, believes that it's not just the IDF's responsibility. 'After all, the IDF does not budget itself,' she says. 'There is a great deal of blame on Israel's decision-makers. There were several years when Israel lacked an approved state budget, which made it impossible to build military strength. Today there are excellent systems, but they are not suitable for UAVs.' And meanwhile, time passes. 'The time that has passed between the war in Ukraine, the October 7 massacre, and today, was preparing ourselves better for such a challenge, and we are closing the gap today, while under fire when it could have been done when we were not at war.' The Directorate of Defense, Research, & Development (DDR&D) at the Ministry of Defense, is not worried about looking for 'solutions under fire'. We work better when we're under pressure. That's the Israeli nature', says an official in DDR&D. However, it would have been better to find solutions for UAV threats beforehand. 'Over the years, the security system has faced multiple and diverse threats. But things keep changing. The Iron Dome system is constantly improving, because the UAV is also changing in terms of communication, color, and power source; today it runs on fuel and tomorrow it's electric. We have to adjust to these changes. But we have some solutions in store, and we believe we are headed in the right direction.' The quick solution and the open hole The need for quick solutions to handle UAV threats led the defense establishment to re-use the old Vulcan cannon which had been in service with the Israel Air Force in the past and received modifications as the 'Racquet' variant. It is a six-barrel rotary cannon able to fire 22mm 6,000 rounds per minute. This cannon was stationed on top of an armored personnel carrier (APC), originally designed to shoot down aircraft, mainly slow ones, and surfboards. As the planes became faster, and the threats became missiles and rockets, its use decreased, until it was retired in 2006 after the Second Lebanon War. Now the security establishment is considering reusing the Vulcan. The UAVs fly slowly enough, and this is a relatively cheap solution, although the problem of detection remains. It will probably be designated to protect military facilities. In May, for example, a Hezbollah UAV hit the large Sky Dew observation balloon located near the Golani junction in the north. It's possible that some Vulcans could have protected it. 'The Vulcan was very useful in the Yom Kippur War, it was a fantastic weapon,' recalls Brigadier General (Res.) Kochav. Is this the solution? Vulcan from a generation ago? 'Even the Vulcan will not perform 100 percent. It will add 5-10%. But eventually, the drone is made up of an engine and a propeller. It's a very simple engine. In terms of the aviation world, a UAV is going backward, so the anti-aircraft missile is also going backward. But make no mistake, there are also other methods, some are classified.' The official in the DDR&D also assures that Israel is developing interception solutions for UAVs. 'There are technologies in Israel's arsenal that have not yet been deployed. We have already spent hundreds of millions of shekels on solutions to the threats of drones and UAVs. Besides, Iron Dome, Barak (a defense system against naval missiles), and also pilots, know how to intercept these threats, as they resemble military UAVs. The challenge is posed by radio-controlled planes, kites, and products that one can buy on AliExpress. In that case, we take measures that are more suitable for drones.' Prof. Weihs from the Technion emphasizes that the solution for UAVs involves money. If a UAV costs a few thousand dollars, but intercepting it costs ten times as much, this is a problem. 'So, one of the challenges is not how to take down drones, but rather to take them down cheaply,' he explains. 'You use fighter jets or Iron Dome, which cost a lot of money, against a small, cheap aircraft. If something costs ten thousand dollars and you use a hundred thousand dollars to shoot it down, it won't last long. And there's another problem. Once you launch interceptors above a populated area, pieces of the interceptors can fall and injure people.' So, what can be both cheap, effective and safe? 'Disruptions, for example. But to disrupt drones, one has to be familiar with the system. The disruption should focus specifically on the direction of the UAV. Too much disruption might act against you as well. This is one of the problems. On the other hand, if you try to disrupt at a great distance, the power is lessened.' Can this also help us in the event of a swarm drone attack? 'It's difficult, but possible. A swarm is centralized, so you can transmit the disruption to focus only on it.' In the end, everyone hopes that the 'Magen Or' laser system will be operational soon and could provide a solution to the UAV threat. The system, which will be Israel's first air defense layer, will launch a powerful laser beam toward the UAV during its flight. The laser is supposed to produce a high temperature, thus causing the drone to explode in the air or it will be taken down. It's a relatively cheap solution (each laser launch will cost about a thousand dollars, compared to about $50,000 interceptor of the Iron Dome). However, the system is still in experimental phases, and the best-case scenario will be operational next year. 'The goal of the Ministry of Defense is to deploy a powerful laser system as part of the Iron Dome architecture,' explains an official from the Ministry of Defense. How will it work? 'The 'brain' will make an automatic decision whether to launch a laser beam or an interceptor that hits the target. The British have the DragonFire laser which is under development; the South Koreans introduced it a month ago a small laser, and of course, the Americans, have a mobile laser system. But we are developing a ground laser for air defense purposes. By the way, there are other variations of a powerful laser, which will eventually be able to intercept high-altitude threats, but this will take a decade to develop.' Not everyone is convinced that laser is the magic solution. Lior Segal is CEO at Third Eye Systems. Shortly before October 7, his company developed 'Meduza' an electro-optical scanning system dedicated to drone recognition. 'The arsenal developed by the big industries doesn't know how to respond to small objects (like UAVs),' he says. 'The use of laser, for example, in my eyes is an amazing idea that was efficient ten years ago, but it does not offer a magic solution for UAVs, because it is a super-expensive system, and above all because the northern border is complex in terms of its topography. These are not the plainlands of Ukraine. The laser is 'Nice to have', but it will not solve all our problems. Rafael is unlikely to develop a drone that intercepts a drone; so this is where small companies like ours fit in and make the difference'. Still, the hole in Israel's sky is open. Prof. Weihs however believes, from his many years of experience, and as someone who was there when the first Tadiran-made UAVs went into the air, that 'every threat is eventually resolved,' he states. And then what? 'Then comes the next generation.'

Inside Lebanon with IDF reservists: 'We are here to do what we di...	The 646th Reserve Brigade uncovered Hezbollah's Radwan Force plan to invade the Galilee, dismantling extensive weapon stockpiles and infrastructure just hundreds of meters from the border; 'Even our emergency reserves don’t have vests fully loaded with magazines and grenades at this scale,' says one soldier A short drive separates Israel's western Galilee from a Lebanese village harboring terrorist strongholds, where the IDF’s 646th Battalion is gathering massive caches of weapons. A year after the reserve paratroopers defended Kibbutz Be’eri near Gaza, they now find themselves conducting offensive operations in Lebanese villages. 'Last year, on Simchat Torah, we were in defensive mode. Now we're on the offensive,' said Col. Elad Shoshan, who became battalion commander just a week before the war began in October 2023. In the past year, Shoshan and his troops fought in Gaza's border region, Jenin, Nur a-Shams, and Rafah. Most recently, they had been stationed in northern Israel, poised for this moment—to cross the border and restore the peace and security lost to tens of thousands of displaced Israelis. 'Just as we defeated the enemy in Gaza, we're here to do the same in the north,' Shoshan said. 'We're dismantling enormous terror infrastructure, weapons caches beyond comprehension.' Troops who left behind families, careers, and lives now cross into Lebanon to change the situation on the ground. Shoshan noted, 'Ultimately, civilians rely on us—this is our army. There's no other military, and they know they can depend on us.' Across the border, I saw soldiers deeply engaged and surprisingly upbeat. Their mission is difficult and high-risk, yet immensely rewarding. Many sent messages of appreciation to families who celebrated the recent holidays alone, awaiting their return. 'Our reservists are both the citizens calling for action and the soldiers executing it,' Shoshan said. 'They’re here, answering each call, leaving entire lives behind to do their part.' Shoshan, who grew up in the Gaza-adjacent Moshav Yated, has lost friends and comrades in battles over the past year. Among them was Col. Aliim Saad, deputy commander of Brigade 300, who died in an encounter with terrorists that infiltrated Israel from a village near Adamit on October 9, 2023, along with two members of his command team. 'We have unfinished business with Hezbollah,' Shoshan said. 'Today, we’ve taken back the village where that cell launched attacks last year. We’re uncovering weaponry stockpiles large enough to arm an entire battalion, stored just 500 meters from our border. Every street and home here was filled with equipment, ready for an attack on Israel. And this is just one of many positions Hezbollah prepared in its planned assault on the Galilee.' Driving through the village paths, soldiers march past houses, securing and neutralizing terror sites. The IDF, now operating with five brigades along Lebanon's border, aims to eliminate Hezbollah’s capabilities, enabling displaced residents in the north to return home only when the threat is eradicated. At a command post, soldiers unload large quantities of weapons and gear uncovered in homes and underground facilities nearby. In recent weeks, they discovered a vast underground complex meant for Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force, complete with bunk beds, supplies, weapons, and launch sites abandoned during their retreat. 'Look at what we’ve found in just the past two hours,' Shoshan said, pointing to piles of combat vests packed with grenades and magazines, each labeled with a fighter’s name. 'Even in our own reserves, we don’t have vests this fully equipped,' he admitted. Next to the vests lay stacks of kneepads, uniforms, winter gear, tactical helmets, and advanced night vision devices. They also found rocket launchers, shells, anti-tank missiles, machine guns, explosives, and countless rounds of ammunition, some clearly marked as coming from Moscow, Russia. 'In these fortified combat zones Hezbollah built—some just 50 meters from our border—we found fighting trenches and mines ready to be deployed,' Shoshan added. 'Hezbollah operatives could have approached the border in civilian clothing, armed and ready within minutes.' 'I never expected this scale in a small Sunni village,' he said. In some houses, troops were laying explosives for detonation as I crossed back over the border, seeing a massive gray cloud appear in the distance. 'To the people of northern Israel, this is how we’re dismantling Hezbollah’s offensive network,' he stated. In the sky to our south, within Israeli territory, interceptor trails lit up as they countered another rocket barrage from deep inside Lebanon, severely injuring a Nahariya resident. More than 100 rockets had been launched just before the holiday. As I looked up in frustration, Shoshan explained, 'We're not here to occupy all of Lebanon. Our mission is to dismantle enemy infrastructure and remove any threat near the border. The IDF has nearly completed this task.' According to him, 'Thousands of Hezbollah fighters and leaders have been neutralized, and their long-range launch capabilities are diminished, but that alone won’t stop the fire from Lebanon. It will require a binding agreement to make clear the consequences of non-compliance. If that fails, the IDF will respond forcefully. We can no longer rely on external enforcement, as we did after 2006. We’ll take full responsibility this time.' Just before heading home, I met Maj. A, deputy commander of 420th Battalion and resident of Kiryat Shmona. A month ago, at the start of this ground maneuver in Lebanon, I interviewed him near his hometown. 'The people here aren’t interested in strategy or tactics; they just want the Hezbollah threat gone—an objective only achieved by pushing in and clearing out,' he had told me then. Now, with a look of relief, he’s beginning to envision a future where he can persuade his wife and six children to return home after the war. 'It’s unbelievable to think that we lived here on a powder keg,' he said. 'We thought we were in the safest place, but our home was actually one of the most dangerous in the world. Hezbollah made a grave miscalculation by joining Hamas's attack, pushing the army to intervene. Without this response, we would’ve faced another failed model like Resolution 1701, risking a future surprise attack. Compared to what they had prepared for us here, Hamas was a mere warm-up.'

Macron’s Dirty Game: The price of silence on Hezbollah	A report by journalist Georges Malbrunot claims that Rodolphe Saadé, owner of BFM TV and CMA-CGM, secured a billion-dollar contract to rebuild the Beirut port market after the 2020 blast in exchange for Macron's silence on Hezbollah’s weapons, avoiding French taxes France’s recent hostility towards the Jewish state may be motivated by an additional layer of corruption, a respected French journalist has revealed. Renowned journalist at Le Figaro and Middle East expert, Georges Malbrunot, made waves after he brought attention to the secret deal allegedly made in 2020 between French President Emmanuel Macron and Hezbollah in Lebanon — reported both in his book and in Le Figaro. Malbrunot reported that the deal allegedly ensured Rodolphe Saadé, owner of BFM TV and the French maritime transport company CMA-CGM, received the contract to rebuild the market of the port of Beirut after the deadly Beirut Blast in 2020, in exchange for Macron’s silence when it comes to Hezbollah’s weapons. This was a deal worth billions of dollars and one that also allowed Saadé to avoid French taxes on much of the deal. In his book, Malbrunot quotes Hezbollah’s Mohammed Raad who met with Macron during his visit to Lebanon in 2020 in a then unprecedented meeting between a Western democratic state and a terrorist organization: 'Emmanuel Macron recognizes the existence of Hezbollah in the region and its importance, which is very important to us…' Malbrunot further quotes a Lebanese source close to Hezbollah who stated, 'The French had told us that Emmanuel Macron would not address the issue of our weapons…' Malbrunot notes that Saadé, who traveled to Lebanon with Macron during that same time period, also offered to send his private plane to Hezbollah backed Lebanese Minister of Transportation Ali Hamieh, to bring him to Marseille to close the contract. In the end, CMA-CGM did win the contract, and according to Mabrunot citing Lebanese sources this week, Hamieh was indeed sent Saadé’s plane following the completion of the lucrative business deal. If confirmed, which appears likely given Malbrunot’s sources, the secret pact demonstrates profound corruption at the highest levels in France and can explain France’s recent hostility towards Israel’s actions in Lebanon — including the condemnation of Israel’s operations in Gaza and Lebanon, the call for of an arms embargo of Israel, accusations that Israel is 'intentionally' targeting UNIFIL troops, and the exclusion of Israel from the recent Euronaval defense show conference in France. This week France also pledged to provide $100 million in aid to Lebanon after Prime Minister Netanyahu and French President Macron exchanged tense words regarding Israeli military actions in Lebanon, in which Macron accused Israel of 'sowing barbarism.' Macron’s increased hostility to Israel was also met with harsh condemnation from Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant who wrote on X, 'Macron's actions are a disgrace to the French nation and the values of the free world, which he claims to uphold…' In response to the publication of the discrete pact back in 2020, Macron had a public altercation with Malbrunot in which he harshly criticized the journalist calling his report 'irresponsible for France, irresponsible for those concerned here, and serious from an ethical point of view.' However several years later, it seems Malbrunot’s report proved accurate based on the evidence thus far. It appears that the French President has put the corporate profits of CGM-CMA above the security of Lebanon and Israel alike — and in doing so has legitimized the Iranian backed terror group Hezbollah, despite their hijacking of the Lebanese government and terrorist activities. As such, it shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone to see Macron making the kind of biased and unfounded accusations he has made in recent months against Israel.

War in the north through camera lens of a mental health officer	Guy Shmueli serves as a reserve mental health officer at an IDF base, and in his spare time, he pulls out his camera to document small moments that, through his talent, transform into moving and inspiring images; 'Photography is a form of therapy for me amid the ongoing tension of this period' he says The war has entered its second year, and Guy Shmueli, a reserve mental health officer serving at an IDF base in northern Israel, continues to capture moments of humanity and normalcy amid a complex and tense reality through his camera lens. 'Photography is a form of therapy for me during this ongoing tension, helping me find the 'human,' the 'warm,' and the beautiful, alongside the complex emotions,' Guy said. 'I hope my photos convey at least part of my experience.' What does a mental health officer do during such a sensitive time? 'The role of a mental health officer in wartime consists of two main parts: one involves systemic work with groups of commanders and soldiers, providing mental preparation talks, tools to identify emotional difficulties, and guidance on initial mental health assistance and debriefing after significant events. The second part focuses on individual work with soldiers experiencing emotional challenges who require support. Amid all this, I move around and take pictures as a way to maintain my mental health—capturing human moments within the routine of war.'

Iran’s imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate sentenced to another...	Free Narges Coalition says Narges Mohammadi was sentenced on Oct. 19 to an additional 6 months in prison on the charge of 'disobeying and resisting orders' Iranian authorities have issued an additional six-month prison sentence against Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, a group campaigning for the activist said. The Free Narges Coalition said in a statement on Thursday that Mohammadi was sentenced on Oct. 19 to an additional six months in prison on the charge of 'disobeying and resisting orders.' According to the statement, the charge was brought after Mohammadi staged a protest against the execution of another political prisoner in the women’s ward of Evin Prison on Aug.6. Mohammadi is the 19th woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize and the second Iranian woman after human rights activist Shirin Ebadi in 2003. Mohammadi, 52, has kept up her activism despite numerous arrests by Iranian authorities and years behind bars. She is being held at Iran’s notorious Evin Prison, which houses political prisoners and those with Western ties. She already had been serving a 30-month sentence, to which 15 more months were added in January. Iran’s government has not acknowledged her additional sentencing. The latest order reflects the Iranian theocracy’s anger that she was awarded the Nobel prize in October 2023 for years of activism despite a decades-long government campaign targeting her. Mohammadi was a leading light for nationwide, women-led protests sparked by the death last year of a 22-year-old woman in police custody that have grown into one of the most intense challenges to Iran’s theocratic government. That woman, Mahsa Amini, had been detained for allegedly not wearing her headscarf to the liking of authorities. The statement demanded Mohammadi’s unconditional release, saying her health situation has deteriorated drastically during her long incarceration and she is suffering from heart disease.

Day by day for a year: Inside the spy ring’s surveillance operati...	From observation balloons to air force bases, Iron Dome batteries to the ports of Ashdod, Haifa and Eilat—22-page indictment details surveillance photos taken by northern residents charged with espionage for Iran, documenting their activities nearly daily A 22-page indictment filed Friday charges seven northern Israeli residents with espionage for Iran, detailing an alleged year-long surveillance operation during which they reportedly photographed sensitive military and strategic sites across Israel. The seven suspects allegedly operated as a cell recruited by an Iranian agent, collecting information and taking photos of key military bases and infrastructure. These included air force bases, Iron Dome defense batteries, ports and major highways, among other sensitive sites, prosecutors said. The group’s suspected leader, Aziz Nisanov, 43, from Haifa, allegedly maintained contact with two Iranian handlers, recruiting additional members for the cell.

IDF names 3 fallen soldier in northern Gaza Strip battles	The tank in which Captain Barak Israel Sagan, Sergeant Ido Ben Zvi, and Sergeant Hillel Ovadia were in was hit by a powerful explosive device, and another soldier was injured in the incident The IDF reported Friday that Captain Barak Israel Sagan, aged 22, from Petah Tikva, Sergeant Ido Ben Zvi, aged 21, from Shomrat, and Sergeant Hillel Ovadia, aged 22, from Jerusalem, all soldiers from the 196th Battalion's Tank Commanders Course, 460th Brigade, fell during combat in the northern Gaza Strip. Since the beginning of the war, 765 IDF soldiers have been killed in battle. The incident occurred around 5 am when a Merkava Mark 4 tank was heavily damaged, likely by a powerful explosive device, and in the incident another soldier was injured. The force had been operating against a renewed Hamas stronghold in a refugee camp at the city’s center, previously maneuvered by the 98th Division months ago. The 460th Brigade is one of three brigades operating in Jabaliya for roughly a month amid renewed Hamas activity in the northern Gaza Strip city. Though most Jabaliya residents have ultimately evacuated the area, which is encircled by the IDF, several thousand Gazans remain, and the raid is expected to continue for several weeks, according to estimates. Since the operation began about a month ago, the IDF reports that around 45,000 Gazans have been evacuated from the encircled area in Jabalia. The data also shows that IDF forces have detained 300 terror suspects through checkpoints set up around Jabalia. In the past 24 hours alone, the IDF says it has killed about 50 militants, part of hundreds killed in the area over the last month. Earlier on Friday, the military also reported that five troops were killed in South Lebanon fighting when a building they were in was bombed. The soldiers are Major (Res.) Dan Maori, Captain (Res.) Alon Safrai, Warrant Officer (Res.) Omri Lotan, Warrant Officer (Res.) Guy Idan, and Master Sergeant (Res.) Tom Segal.

Senior Hamas official rejects reported partial deal for Gaza	Osama Hamdan says Israel attempts to work around basic demands to withdraw its troops and end the war Osama Hamdan a senior member of the Hamas terror group on Friday rejected a proposal for a 'small deal,' that would see the release of some of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Families of hostages said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told them during his visit to Israel earlier in the week that he was trying to secure an initial deal to 'test the waters' and see who can now speak for Hamas after the killing of its leader Yahya Sinwar. Blinken met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the first big U.S. push for a Middle East ceasefire since Israel killed the leader of Hamas last week - and the last attempt before a presidential election that could upend U.S. policy. The two men met for 2.5 hours before the secretary met with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Speaking to the Hezbollah-affiliated al-Mayadeen network, Hamdan said Israel was trying to work around the Hamas terms for a deal that would include a withdrawal of troops and an end to the war. 'Israel wants to get some hostages in exchange for a few days of calm without committing to ending the war and pulling out its troops. Hamas rejects the proposals that do not meet our basic demands,' he said.

Russia helps Houthis attack Western vessels in Red Sea, report	Russian satellite data given to the rebels in Yemen by IRGC members, allows a broader area to be attacked and serves Putin's strategic aim to destabilize the Middle East by prolonging the war Russia provided targeting data for Yemen’s Houthi rebels to target ships in the Red Sea, the Wall Street Journal reported late Thursday, as Russian President Vladimir Putin strengthened his ties with Iran and worked to further destabilize the Middle East. The Houthi rebels who have been targeting maritime traffic since the outbreak of the war, claiming to support Hamas in Gaza, were given satellite data from Moscow that enabled them to increase their attacks in a broader area, the Journal reported citing two senior European security sources and another person in the know. One of the sources said the data was provided to the Houthis by members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) who were embedded with the rebel group. According to the paper, the assistance to the Houthis demonstrated how far Putin was willing to go to undermine the West's political and economic order and to destabilize the Middle East and Asia. According to analysts, by prolonging the war in the region, Moscow was forcing Washington to allocate resources and concentrate its attention away from Russia and China. 'For Russia, any flare-up anywhere is good news, because it takes the world’s attention further away from Ukraine and the U.S. needs to commit resources—Patriot systems or artillery shells—and with the Middle East in play, it’s clear where the U.S. will choose,' said Alexander Gabuev, director of Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a think tank based in Berlin. Russia has increased its cooperation with Iran and North Korea and has involved them in the war in Ukraine. Both countries have supplied the Russians with ammunition, drones and missiles and North Korea also sent some 3,000 of its soldiers to train in Russia. According to U.S. and South Korean officials, the assistance is vital for the Russians who are suffering a shortage of manpower and weapons and contributes to Russia's strategic aims in the Middle East.

Spy ring provides photos, intel, on orders from Iran	Seven members of the group are charged with aiding and abetting the enemy in time of war and could face life in prison; among missions they carried out are photographing military bases and strategic civilian infrastructure Members of an Iranian spy ring were indicted on Friday on charges of aiding the enemy in time of war, carrying a penalty of life in prison. The seven, including a father and his two sons, photographed military and strategic installations on orders from Iranian intelligence handlers for two years, before being caught. According to court filings, the five adults and two minors photographed the air bases at Nevatim, Ramat David, Tel Nof and Palmachim, as well as other bases around the country including the Glilot complex north of Tel Aviv. They also photographed Iron Dome missile defense system batteries in the Haifa area, government buildings in Haifa, the ports of Haifa, Ashdod and Eilat, the Hadera power plant, and the IDF observation balloon in the Golani Junction area. The suspected leader of the group is Aziz Nisanov, 43 from Haifa who was in contact with two Iranian handlers and enlisted the other members of the spy ring. His deputy was Alexander Sadikov, 58 also from Haifa who ran the group's operation and handed out assignments to its members. One of the minors indicted is charged with carrying out most photographing missions and sending the images to the Iranian handlers. Other members of the group are Yigal Nisan, 20 Nisanov's son, Vyacheslav Guschin, 46 from Haifa and Yevgeni Ioffe, 47 from Nof Hagalil, and another minor. They are charged by Haifa prosecutors of carrying out missions for two years, for Iranian intelligence for the purpose of gathering intelligence for Iran on military installations and civilian infrastructure and surveillance of Israelis. They were instructed to photograph the Nevatim airbase one day after Iran's April attack on Israel. They were sent exact locations of sites, maps and aerial photographs and on some occasions were told the exact locations from which to take the pictures. One of the underage defendants was the locations that would be required for future missions, including the Golani training base's dining room which was hit in a deadly drone strike earlier this month and a defense industry site in the north. Nisanov was also asked to gather information on a lecturer at Haifa University who was a gas engineer and an expert on the Caucasus, including her schedule, her family, what car she drove and more. According to the indictment, one of the Iranian handlers asked Nisanov to attend and photograph the opening of the Azerbaijan embassy in Tel Aviv in March 2023 after he disclosed that his mother had been invited to attend. The event was closed and Nisanov's mother took pictures of the opening, which he then sent to his handler. In September, before the ring was arrested, Nisanov was asked to rent a yacht and sail to Cyprus to film the port there and the maritime rout from Cyprus to Haifa. After enquiring about the rental of a boat or alternatively training as a captain, Nisanov relayed the estimated cost to his handler, who then scrapped the plan. The indictment described another mission the group was given in September which was to photograph a soccer match and training sessions for adults and children at the soccer stadium in Beer Sheva. They were also asked to take pictures of the city's museum and the nearby community of Lahav, including its streets, its fences and areas around it. Nisanov informed his handlers that he had been invited as a musician to play in an event honoring the Bukhara community, that was to be attended by President Issac Herzog and members of the government. He provided the list of attendees and a description of who they are and was asked to photograph them but was arrested before the event.

Iran prepares for war with Israel if strike significant, report	Khamenei instructs the military to prepare optional retaliation plans if IDF inflicts significant damage, including the launch of 1,000 ballistic missiles, disruption to the world's energy supplies in maritime traffic in Persian Gulf and Straits of Hormuz Iran was preparing for war with Israel, the New York Times reported overnight, claiming Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei gave the order to prepare to respond to any Israeli attack, proportionately. The report also claimed that if the Israeli attack on Iran is relatively contained, Tehran may not launch a counterattack. The Times said Khamenei instructed the military to prepare different plans to respond to an Israel strike on Iran. Four officials in the Islamic Republic told the paper that if an Israeli attack would cause substantial damage, Iran would respond but if the attack is limited to military installations and weapons stores, there may be no Iranian retaliation. The sources, two of them identified as members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said that an Israeli strike that would cause substantial damage could be responded to by a barrage of up to 1,000 ballistic missiles; escalated attacks by Iranian proxies in the region; and disrupting the flow of global energy supplies and maritime traffic through the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. Officials in Israel denied reports in the London Times claiming an attack on Iran was postponed because of classified documents leaked from the Pentagon, outlining Israeli preparations for the strike. Intelligence sources told the Times that the leak required Israel to change parts of the attack plans. Israel planned a strike on IRGC and military installations and promised the Biden administration that it would not target Iran's nuclear program or its oil industry. Michael Allen, a partner at Beacon Global Strategies, a security advisory firm, and former National Security Council official in the George W. Bush administration told the Washington Post that Israel may choose to target military sites rather than oil installations because it may hamper future Iranian strikes. 'They’re not going to waste a bullet,' Allen said. 'I think it’s going to be very purposeful targeting.' He said adding that targeting Iran’s launch sites would be 'the most logical option for Israel if it wants to degrade Iran’s abilities to strike back.' The post said Iran has a handful of launch sites, including the Tabriz, Bakhtaran and Imam missile bases in the west and Bandar Abbas in the south, according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a Washington think tank. The launch sites in western Iran are key, as they are closer to Israel.

Hostages are important bargaining chips,' Sinwar writes	The documents published in East Jerusalem paper refer to scriptures from the Quran on how hostages are to be treated; Al Quds does not detail where they were found, or how the publication received them but claims they are in Yahya Sinwar's handwriting The Palestinian al Quds newspaper published in east Jerusalem revealed documents it described as instructions left by slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar written by his own hand in which he refers to the hostages abducted by Hamas, describes them and how they are to be treated. The paper published three such documents written over a year ago, before the only hostage release, last November. They include instructions to protect the hostages, details about them and the names of 11 women that have since been released. The first documents include scriptures from the Quran referring to how hostages are to be treated. 'They must be protected, they are an important bargaining chip,' he wrote. The second document lists hostages by gender and age and whether they are soldiers or civilians. It lists five men over the age of 60, ten men under 60, three soldiers, three women under 40 marked X, presumably dead, and four women over 40. 25 in total, 22 of them alive. According to the document, 25 hostages were being held in central Gaza including six soldiers, 12 reservists, the oldest being 53, and seven young people aged 21 to 27.

Hezbollah converted villages in southern Lebanon to command cente...	IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari says Hezbollah built underground command centers for the Radwan unit, with entrances intentionally placed beneath residential buildings The IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari revealed Thursday that Hezbollah's Radwan Force turned civilian villages in southern Lebanon into fortified combat zones and military staging areas concealed beneath dense vegetation. 'For years, Hezbollah has been planning how it would launch an incursion into our territory on command, and now we are exposing their strategy,' said Hagari. 'For the past month, our forces have been operating in villages and areas near the border to push Hezbollah away from the front line,' he said. 'The terror group has built a system of underground combat facilities beneath thick vegetation, where they store various weapons.' Hagari explained that in these areas, Hezbollah has 'hidden' underground command centers for the Radwan unit, with entrances intentionally placed beneath residential buildings as part of their preparation for an attack. 'Over the past year, the Northern Command has carried out a series of strikes and special operations targeting these infrastructures in southern Lebanon to weaken Hezbollah's capabilities and eliminate the threat to northern residents,' he said. Hagari presented two examples to illustrate what Israeli forces have encountered, showing how Hezbollah has prepared the area in the Lavona region of southern Lebanon as a forward base for potential incursions. 'Hezbollah has constructed a network of underground combat facilities beneath dense vegetation. Our forces have operated in the area over the past month, clearing it of terrorist infrastructure, including the dense vegetation,' he noted. In adjacent areas, he mentioned, living quarters with beds and combat equipment were found concealed in dense foliage near the border. Another example highlighted was the IDF's activity in the rural areas of southern Lebanon, where villages have long become Hezbollah strongholds. 'In the village of Mhaibib in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah hid an underground command center for the Radwan unit. The entrances to the command center were deliberately located beneath residential homes. Along hundreds of meters of underground pathways, we discovered long-term living quarters that included bedrooms, kitchens, food supplies, showers, scooters, and a large cache of weapons—all part of their preparation for an attack.' He noted that the forces confiscated and destroyed the weapons found on-site and neutralized the 'main route' of the local tunnel network. 'Hezbollah has built all this over the years and invested substantial resources, and now we are denying them that capability,' Hagari said. 'The underground infrastructures I presented here do not cross into Israeli territory. These are underground staging areas that Hezbollah has built beyond the border as part of their strategy to launch incursions into Israel. So far, we have identified only one tunnel that crossed just a few meters into our territory—and we destroyed it.' He added, 'In the past month alone, we have attacked more than 3,200 targets in southern Lebanon, including around 350 weapons depots.'

Sapir feared suffocation; Staff Sergeant D. found bodies: People ...	Sapir Cohen, freed from Hamas captivity, describes a life devoid of light, plagued by moisture and mold; Staff Sergeant D. shares experiences of engaging terrorists in the tunnels; Prof. Kobi Michael warns that other enemies are focusing on underground warfare; Brigadier General (Res.) Ido Mizrahi evaluates both failures and successes regarding tunnel operations, while Prof. Silvana Fennig examines the long-term psychological effects of this underground existence For two decades the combination of the words 'Hamas Tunnels' has been considered a nightmare for Israelis. Such a tunnel exploded underneath the JVT outpost at the Philadelphi corridor in 2004, killing five soldiers. Such tunnels were used for the kidnapping of Gilad Shalit and the bodies of Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul. At Operation Protective Edge in 2014 Nukhba terrorists infiltrated Israel via such underground tunnel dug from Gaza into Israel, and they were recorded killing Israeli soldiers. On the morning of October 7, 2023, when hundreds of Israeli abductees were being dragged or marched into the Gaza Strip, all Israelis cringed at the thought that within minutes they would be led tens of feet underground. A year has passed, and the horror has not faded. In some respects, and certainly after presenting videos of the dark tunnel where Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Almog Sarusi, Carmel Gat, and Alex Lobanov were murdered at the end of August, the fear has intensified. And yet, since the onset of the ground maneuver about 11 months ago, we know much more about the massive underground network that Palestinian terrorist organizations have dug under the Gaza Strip over the years. This was made possible due to the countless hours of IDF soldiers operating inside it, but tragically more so, thanks to firsthand stories of hostages who have returned, helping to shed light on the life, if you can call it that, inside the tunnels. Here are monologues by five people who summarize what Israel knows about the most significant strategic asset held by the Gazan enemy. I said to the terrorists: Maybe it's better to be down in the tunnel / Sapir Cohen After a long walk, during which I stepped with my bare feet on nails and other unfamiliar objects, I was brought to a place that looked like a shelter, with concrete and thick walls, and I was ordered to enter the elevator. The 'elevator' was a concrete block that somehow moved vertically. I didn't know I was in a tunnel because I entered straight into a space with porcelain paving, but I quickly learned that there are 'tunnels' and there are 'passages between the tunnels', through which one can cross from one space to another. A 'passage' is, for example, the narrow tunnel where the bodies of the six murdered hostages were found at the end of August. These are the narrow, low, and arched passageways that Israelis know from the pictures. After spending a few days in an underground tunnel, I climbed up using a ladder, and I was moved through the passages to houses located above the ground. All the houses I was held in were connected by tunnels. When I stayed in the houses I would hear terrible bombings and thought it would be better to be down, inside the tunnel; but when I told this to the terrorists, their answer was: 'No. If there is a bombing you will suffocate down there.' Still, after a short while, I returned to the underground tunnel. Inside the tunnel, there is no light at all. Sometimes a terrorist would turn on a flashlight, but still, I could see nothing. There is no air either. One of the terrorists had an oxygen cylinder; there was this time when I had trouble breathing so he let me use it. However, when in the tunnel no one can hear you, so you can speak loudly, unless it annoys the terrorist. There were some tunnels with electrical infrastructure, which sometimes worked and sometimes didn't. The senior terrorist who was guarding my group had some knowledge of electricity, so now and then he would fix it. Sometimes there were batteries available, and I also saw generators there, but it didn't help us. The tunnels are damp, and you constantly have to wipe the water that drips from the ceiling onto the walls and floor. The five thin mattresses we slept on were also soaked. The humidity caused mold, and the smell was so terrible that it was impossible to fall asleep. When I went from the houses back to the tunnel I took a Q-tip I found there, and a day later it turned green. People developed skin diseases, and wounds started appearing on their bodies. They scratched because there were lice and fleas, and you couldn't shower. We looked pale, with dark circles under the eyes. In the tunnel, there is nothing to do besides talking to the other hostages. Also, there is no sense of time. At first, I had no idea when it was morning or night because everything looked the same. But the terrorists prayed five times a day, so I was able to tell, roughly, what part of the day it was. The main food you get is pita bread. When there were no pitas, we would eat nothing. Since every tunnel with hostages is located adjacent to a house, one of the terrorists would climb the ladder, take food, and bring it down. There was this time when the house near us was bombed and the children there were seriously injured by shrapnel, so whoever lived there did not allow providing us with any food at all. There was a small refrigerator in the tunnel, but of course, it didn't work. There was also a tap with salted water, and it didn't always work either; so, if the terrorists didn't provide us water - we wouldn't drink. We tried to save food, but the pita would get dry and moldy after a day. Our tunnel had a gas unit, and when it had gas in it, we would heat the pita so it would be easier to bite. We would try to find ways to take food without the terrorists noticing, to hide it and remove the mold from it. The terrorists held daily 'meetings', they would go into a nearby room, so we managed to take pitas and hide them. Still, there were days when there was no light, no electricity, no gas, no water, and no food. We were lucky to have toilets in our tunnel, which was unusual because other groups of hostages didn't have any at all, or they had ones that wouldn't flush. I know that this was the case in the tunnel where they held the elders. There was no medical treatment either. There was a hostage with me whose leg was injured and swollen, and he was limping. There was nothing we could do about it. The tunnels in Gaza are so ramified that even terrorists had trouble finding their way around. You need to have someone who knows it well and can tell where to go and which turn to take. I heard from other hostages that they had to walk underground for hours because the terrorists who held them didn't know how and where to go. Each group of hostages had several terrorists who served as guards. Some terrorists carried their weapons in public and some hid their weapons. Now and then we would hear a weapon being cocked, which is petrifying. We were mostly afraid that Israeli soldiers would try to rescue us because we knew that in this case, the terrorists would shoot at us. All this time I knew I was underground in Gaza and was surrounded by terrorists, but I didn't internalize it. For a certain period, I lived in another world, disconnected, as if something happened to my body. But things change. I met hostages who didn't know what happened to their families, or those whose family members were murdered in front of their eyes, and I felt the need to put my problems aside and help them. I said to myself that no matter what, I would do everything in my power to help, bring them food, and talk to them. That's what kept me going. This has become my life's mission. Sapir Cohen, 30,was abducted on October 7 from her partner's house, Alex (Sasha) Trufanov, in Kibbutz Nir Oz. She was released with his mother Yelena and his grandmother Irena Tati in the final swap deal after spending 55 days in captivity. Her partner Trufanov is still in captivity. Other armies are already learning from us / Prof. Kobi Michael In the Iron Swords War, the IDF was exposed to a different reality in Gaza from the one it once knew, or thought it knew, because IDF's last maneuver in the field occurred a decade earlier, in Operation 'Protective Edge'. They knew that Gaza was networked with tunnels, but never imagined they would discover tunnels in such dimensions in terms of their scope, depth, system, and sophistication, including the connecting points between the various tunnels. They did not know that the underground network allowed Hamas terrorists to enter the tunnel in the Philadelphi corridor and end up above the ground in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. They did not realize that hostages could stay inside for a long period and did not know that they were connected to civilian infrastructures such as hospitals. The professional building of the tunnel network indicates that they used external help and expertise. The IDF needed quite a long learning time to deal with the tunnels that were gradually unfolding, since entering the tunnels is complex to begin with – usually via hidden, narrow, and sometimes very deep shafts. But over time they managed to deal with it, and could also tell the difference between tactical tunnels that were used for combat and attacks, and strategic tunnels that included equipped and advanced command and control rooms, which supported the tactical tunnels and were essential for Hamas activity. The next challenge the IDF had to face was how to destroy the tunnels. After various strategies were examined, such as flooding, which was proved unsuccessful, other methods were developed, apart from the use of explosives. The IDF continues to this day to uncover the underground infrastructure, but it is complex due to the enormous number of tunnels and their ramified structure. Moreover, the tunnels must first be discovered. The tunnel in Rafah where the bodies of the six hostages were found at the end of August, was unfolded almost by accident since its shaft was hidden inside a children's room in a residential building. Imagine how many more shafts are out there, especially in densely populated or ruined areas. However, the IDF has already learned about the close connection between the civilian infrastructure, the population, and the tunnels. Not only do they know that Gaza citizens participate in the digging, but they know also about the critical importance that Hamas attaches to the symbiosis between life above and below the ground: there may be a shaft in every school and a tunnel under every hospital. The connection between the upper construction and the lower construction adds to the complexity. As a result, the IDF has developed a new theory for underground warfare. There is no other army in the world that faces such a threat at such a level. And apparently, this is not over yet. Until the IDF leaves the Gaza Strip - if they ever will - they will continue to learn, improve, and develop capabilities and new fighting methods. Other armies worldwide are already learning from the IDF. The bad news is that Hamas tunnels are not an unusual phenomenon among our enemies. We discovered the giant tunnels penetrating from Lebanon already in 2018, and only recently, underground routes - albeit short ones - were located in Tulkarm and Jenin as well. This will have consequences on the IDF's forces, which will require more engineering forces, expanding units such as the Yahalom (Special Operations Engineering Unit), and investing in the development of combat measures and methods. Prof. Kobi Michael is a senior researcher at INSS and Misgav Institute I crawled between the crumbling walls / Staff Sergeant D. During the war I did everything in the tunnels - I scanned, destroyed, ran into combats, and even rescued bodies of hostages. On the one hand, fighting underground involves a greater risk, because if something happens you are in trouble: it is complex to get assistance from the outside, and the only ones who can help you are your comrades who are with you. On the other hand, it is a relatively quiet place, and if we reach it, it means that the odds of encountering the enemy there are not high. It wasn't discussed much in Israel, but some fighting in the tunnels of the Gaza Strip took place already a decade ago, in Operation 'Protective Edge'. Based on this experience, among other things, we trained for underground activity long before the 'Iron Swords' war began. Did we know what we were getting ourselves into? We didn't expect everything we saw there this time, but the truth is, there was nothing we encountered that we couldn't handle. Before entering the tunnels, there is excitement among the soldiers. I cannot define it as 'fear', but we feel we were trained for a unique mission and know that we are ready for it despite the dangers involved. Besides, we had time to prepare ourselves mentally, because, in the beginning, we were mostly busy destroying the tunnels that were found. It took a while until we engaged in rescuing and encountering terrorists. Before we enter the tunnels there is a preparation phase. We use technologies and intelligence to understand what is happening down there. Sometimes we know in advance where the rooms of senior officials are located. But still, we enter with caution. The danger is always there. You can always miss a booby trap or confront an ambush at any given moment. I can't remember how many tunnels I entered, but there were lots of them. The sense of danger hovers above you all the time. You feel the sand falling on you, and you see that the walls are shaking. Most tunnels are about 27 inches wide and 5.6 feet high. I have also seen lower ones or ones that are crumbling. Sometimes I would find myself crawling between half-ruined walls that had collapsed inward. On the other hand, there are also large tunnels with rooms, showers, and running water. Once we were surprised to discover a tunnel that had nice toilets, air conditioning, and lots of water. They didn't build it for a week's stay but planned it for years ahead. In the other tunnels the oxygen level is reasonable, and we were able to breathe during the activity, but it is impossible to stay there for a long time. They have mold, gases, and dust. We monitor the air quality when we are inside, and if the oxygen level is too low - we plan. In most tunnels, we don't expect to find hostages alive. We focus on scanning and task completion. But as mentioned, there were cases when we entered and found bodies. Some were in such bad shape that we didn't recognize they were corpses. Once, at a depth of 82 feet, we found corpses in an advanced state of decay inside white sacks. The sight of it doesn’t leave you, especially when it's the first time you have to handle it, but today we are trained. The only difference is the fighting inside a tunnel as compared to fighting outdoors, where you can see at a distance what's ahead of you and sometimes take cover. In the tunnel everything is limited. The terrorists can suddenly surface and strike. Therefore, the fighters who stand first in line know that they are at the greatest risk. If something happens - they get hit first. We mainly engaged in destroying tunnels, one tunnel after the other, either by using explosives that we placed manually, or by airstrikes. But beforehand we do everything in our power to make sure there are no hostages inside; this can take days and thus delay the operation, but there is no other choice. The fear that there might be Israelis inside never leaves you. We still ask ourselves if our operations destroy the tunnels completely or if Hamas can come after we're done, clear some rubble, and reuse them. As far as I can judge, considering my activity since the beginning of the war, we neutralize them completely. Whoever wishes to reuse these tunnels will have to dig and rebuild them. Yes, we discovered an elaborate underground tunnel network in the Gaza Strip, certainly more complex than we expected, but I think we can destroy it all. It's only a matter of time. Staff Sergeant D. is a fighter in an elite unit. Like running up a descending escalator / Brigadier General (res.) Ido Mizrahi Hamas is a sub-state terrorist organization that uses the underground to store its military and other assets. This is their only way to offset the absolute advantages of Israel and the IDF. As much as Israel enhanced its capabilities in technology and the air force - Hamas deepened its capabilities underground and expanded the 'underground infrastructure'. I use this term because it is important to clarify: These are not just tunnels. Many of the important assets and means of Hamas – military headquarters, production workshops, and storehouses - are underground. Handling this subterranean complex requires a continuous learning effort. It is equivalent to running up a descending escalator: you can't stand still. As you level up, the enemy also makes its next move - deeper and more hidden. In the Iron Swords war, we learned how wide and deep this underground network of Hamas is really like. At this stage we have very good control in the field - one should never say 'absolute' - and we use it for learning. This is one of the most beautiful processes I've seen until I finished serving as Commander of the military's Combat Engineering Corp in January 2024; since then I have continued watching it from the outside: a military unit encounters a certain challenge, deals with it, learns lessons from it, the knowledge is passed on to the neighboring units, then to the entire military and civilian system, and then relevant solutions are offered to handle the problem. Sometimes it involves the top of technology and sometimes it uses medieval low-tech. Since the main characteristic of the underground network in Gaza is concealment, it is very difficult to know what is under our feet; therefore, a great effort is invested in gathering intelligence, and technology and in locating and mapping the tunnels, long before the neutralization stage occurs. To neutralize the tunnels, we tried almost every possible solution, be it technological or other, and every idea that came up was granted legal approval by international law. One of the solutions, which was also published in the media, was the 'Atlantis' project, in which we channeled seawater into the tunnels. But the ground in the strip is too sandy and a large part of the water seeped through it. To make it work, you needed a substance that could move and not be absorbed. I will not go into details about how long we tried it and to what extent it eventually helped us. Fighting underground requires unique training. It is not suitable for every soldier. As in many fields in the IDF, here too there is a wide range of skills. That is: some units have undergone a few weeks of basic training in underground warfare, and there are units such as Yahalom (Special Operations Engineering Unit), whose soldiers train for months for tunnel warfare. The training is carried out in special training facilities that simulate an underground infrastructure. In the field, one of the most significant challenges in underground warfare is that once you send a force into the tunnel, it is very difficult to communicate and know what's happening. Fortunately, we are the army of the 'Startup Nation', and after presenting this problem to the defense industry, they came up with a solution, in an impressively short time. This is not a case of 'fire and forget'. Still, this is a very risky fighting, compared to a classic ground operation, but everyone who enters the tunnel is provided with communication devices that enable them to portray a situational picture and also keep the troops safe. We are still using all the knowledge we have accumulated until October 7, 2023, but there have been developments and changes in tactics since then. Every team that has operated underground since then has learned lessons of do's and don'ts. Some of them are tactical, and some are at a higher level, which requires building a new capability, a new technology, to gather new intelligence on a scenario we haven't encountered before. Learning lessons during a war is not obvious. The IDF does it impressively. Brigadier General (res.) Ido Mizrahi is the former Commander of IDF Combat Engineering Corp. No one can tell if the damages caused by the tunnels are reversible / Prof. Silvana Fennig. Many of the returned hostages that were treated by us spent most of their captivity time in houses of families, and they went underground only when bombings were taking place. The time spent in the tunnels must have been terrible for them, partly due to a lack of stimuli and light. The sense of claustrophobia and the lack of air make it difficult not only physically but mainly psychologically. The long-term damages are also mainly mental. Despite the deficiencies and the weight loss, the children did not experience anything physical that might be irreversible, however, the psychological damage is not always reversible. I cannot tell what the future holds for them, but generally speaking, children who suffer post-traumatic stress disorder might experience anxiety and depression even years later. The terrible fear of death may affect one's personality fundamentally. They suffer a complex trauma because they were taken to captivity after experiencing a previous trauma. They were hiding for hours in terrible fear, and after they were pulled out of their hiding place they witnessed murder and horrible sights; with these images in mind, they were taken to Gaza. Everything adds up. Their coping depends on how they spend their time in captivity. If they were with a family there, then the situation is completely different than being alone. The children who were there with their parents experienced a certain sense of security, and this is also true for the adults who went through it along with someone close. This is very helpful for survival; we know it for a fact from both research on the Holocaust and the experience of Yom Kippur War captive soldiers. When the hostages returned, after the celebration and all the excitement around them, they returned to a shattered community, as evacuees, without a home. The gap between the collective joy of millions of Israelis and their individual story is not simple. They continue their life routine while they are no longer in the news headlines, and they are no longer the heroes. We took this into account when we decided to reduce stimuli - including limiting the number of visitors, even the happy ones - because transitions are not easy. We usually operate by evidence-based study rules and techniques with worldwide supporting scientific evidence, but there are no guidelines available for treating children who returned from captivity during a war because it is extremely rare. We knew that we would have to 'learn on the go'. Professionals base their treatment on past studies and professional literature, and here we had nothing to base our work on. In total we received 26 people, 19 of them were children. We built an inpatient care ward for both young and adults, away from the media, to reduce damage. It was a quiet, sterile, and remote area, with as little stimulation and noise as possible. We had to act at their pace, follow them step by step, respect their routines and rituals, and hear and listen, without pre-built formulas. Beyond the obvious physical medical needs, it was important, psychologically speaking, that they return to a place that can provide professional help. But we knew that our help was only temporary. We were debating whether it was right to bring them back home directly from captivity. Unfortunately, most of them didn't have a home to return to, anyway. They were evacuated from their homes.

Smotrich and Ben Gvir criticize Netanyahu over Qatar delegation: ...	Smotrich says Qatar is an enemy state that supports Hamas and backs its positions in negotiations; Ben-Gvir adds Israel must not give Hamas any breathing space, particularly after the elimination of Sinwar Ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir voiced Thursday opposition to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's directive to send Mossad head David Barnea to Qatar to advance a possible hostage deal. 'The continued involvement of Qatar in negotiations for the release of hostages is a serious mistake,' Smotrich said. Ben Gvir, who also opposed the previous deal that saw the release of 80 Israeli women and children from captivity, added: 'The dispatch of the negotiation team was not done with the consent of all Cabinet members, and therefore I oppose it. 'I deeply regret the prime minister’s decision to approve the Mossad chief's trip for negotiations with Qatar, ' Smotrich continued. 'Qatar is an enemy state that supports Hamas and backs its positions in negotiations. Its goal is to prevent us from destroying Hamas. Qatar owns Al Jazeera, which severely damages Israel's global image and undermines our existential fight. Nothing good can come from its involvement, and we should reject it outright. The only way to bring the hostages home is through Hamas' surrender, achieved by continuing the military pressure our heroic soldiers are currently applying in northern Gaza.' 'At this critical point in Israel's confrontation with Hamas, particularly after the elimination of Sinwar, we must not give Hamas any breathing space,' Ben-Gvir added. 'We should continue working toward its defeat. That is the surest and safest way to achieve victory and bring the hostages home, not through deals that will allow Hamas to regroup, rebuild its military capabilities, and harm our soldiers again.' He concluded by praising Netanyahu, the IDF, and Israel's security forces for their positive trend over the past two months. 'Israel is acting aggressively and engaging the enemy on multiple fronts, and I urge them to continue this path until total victory.'

IDF eliminates Hamas terrorist, employee of UNRWA involved in Oct...	IDF says Mohammad Abu Itiwi and the terrorists under his command threw grenades into the shelter where partygoers from the Nova music festival were hiding; also directed multiple terror operations against IDF forces operating in Gaza The IDF reported Thursday that the Israeli Air Force, in cooperation with the Shin Bet, eliminated Mohammad Abu Itiwi, a Hamas commander who led the massacre at the Re’im shelter and was also an employee of UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. On the day of the October 7 massacre, Abu Itiwi and the terrorists under his command threw grenades into the shelter where partygoers from the Nova music festival were hiding. In one of the most memorable moments from that day, Nahal Brigade soldier Aner Shapira was seen in footage deflecting seven grenades with his hands. The eighth grenade exploded before he could throw it back. Of the 27 people inside the shelter, 16 were murdered, four were kidnapped, and only seven survived. One of those kidnapped, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, was later murdered in a tunnel in Rafah. In a statement delivered Thursday, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said, 'We will continue to pursue and reach all those involved in this brutal massacre. We must remember the 101 hostages still held in inhumane conditions in Gaza. We are committed to bringing them home.' A joint statement from the IDF and Shin Bet explained that Abu Itiwi, a commander in Hamas’s Nuhba unit in the Bureij Battalion of the Central Camps Brigade, was targeted and killed on Wednesday in an airstrike by the Israeli Air Force, coordinated with the Gaza Division's fire center. It was noted that Abu Itiwi, who had worked for UNRWA since July 2022, was involved in the murder and kidnapping of Israeli civilians on October 7. During the war, he also directed multiple terror operations against IDF forces operating in Gaza. Following this incident, representatives from the Israeli Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) demanded clarifications from senior international and UN officials regarding the involvement of UNRWA employees in the October 7 massacre and other terror activities against Israel.

IDF names 4 fallen soldiers in southern Lebanon battles	The incident occurred as the forces approached a Shiite village in the western sector of southern Lebanon and were attacked by terrorists who emerged from a tunnel shaft The IDF reported Thursday that Command Sergeant Major (res.) Mordechai Haim Amoyal, aged 42, from Lod, Sergeant Major (res.) Shmuel Harari, aged 35, from Safed, Master Sergeant (res.) Shlomo Aviad Nayman, aged 31, from Mitzpe Yeriho, and Sergeant First Class (res.) Shuvael Ben-Natan, aged 22, from Rehelim, fell during combat in southern Lebanon, all troops from the 222nd Battalion, 2nd 'Carmeli' Brigade. The incident occurred as the forces approached a Shiite village in the western sector of southern Lebanon, which the brigade was preparing to seize and clear of Hezbollah's Radwan force. Around 6:50 pm, a group of terrorists emerged from a concealed tunnel shaft and attacked the forces. In the incident, six soldiers were injured, three of them seriously. In addition, on Thursday a commander from the 75th Armored Battalion was critically injured in Lebanon by an anti-tank missile; a reservist from the 7155th Paratroopers Battalion was wounded during an encounter with terrorists; and a reservist from the 6226th Reconnaissance Battalion sustained shrapnel injuries in the north. All injured personnel were evacuated by air and ground to hospitals, and their families have been informed.

Possibility to achieve a decisive outcome in the north' IDF chie...	Halevi adds elimination of Sinwar was not planned, but it wasn't random either, its a result of a methodical approach and pressure on Rafah IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi held a situation assessment at the Jabaliya area in the Gaza Strip, stating that 'in the north, there's a possibility of achieving a decisive outcome. We have thoroughly dismantled Hezbollah’s senior command structure.' Halevi added 'The elimination of Sinwar was not planned, nor were the troops from the 450th Brigade or the tank commander course; they didn’t know who they were targeting. While it wasn’t planned, it was not random either.' 'This methodical approach results from the pressure on Rafah and the dismantling of the Rafah Brigade,' he continued. 'It reflects the regional command's insistence on deploying more troops during this holiday month, pushing forward, maintaining operational control, and confronting the problem directly. It’s a systematic effort, not a coincidence. Determination and persistence are key.' 'They are determined too, but we are much more so. We are better, more justified, and stronger. Another achievement is that Jabaliya is falling, marking a significant psychological blow—both physically and mentally. If we eliminate the Northern Gaza Brigade commander, it will be another significant collapse. I cannot predict what we will encounter tomorrow, but this pressure brings us closer to further achievements.' Meanwhile, U.S. and Israeli negotiators will gather in Doha in the coming days to try to restart talks toward a deal for a ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza, officials said on Thursday. Mossad head David Barnea will travel to Doha on Sunday, said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, adding that CIA director William Burns would be present for the talks.

Our troops are more reservists than civilians': A year inside Ga...	Photographer Ziv Koren spent the past year documenting the reservists of the 8119th Reserve Battalion, part of the 16th Infantry Brigade, who completed 180 days of duty in three rotations—each time leaving everything behind to defend their homeland 'On that black Saturday, everyone was looking for a way to contribute. But the real challenge is showing up for reserve duty during routine times—in the peak of summer heat or pouring rain, while balancing school deadlines, career, or when your kids are on summer break. The true heroism is being there all the time, and that’s our pride as a brigade—we were ready for the mission,' said Lt. Col. (Res.) Lotem Paran Farah, 45, commander of the 8119th Reserve Battalion, part of the 16th Infantry Brigade, whose soldiers completed 180 days of reserve duty in the past year across three rotations. The 16th Infantry Brigade, also known as the Jerusalem Brigade, was established during Israel’s War of Independence and has participated in every war since. It operates under the Southern Command’s Sinai Division and consists of four infantry battalions and one logistical support battalion. Over the years, its soldiers have fought in key battles, including the liberation of Jerusalem in the Six-Day War and the defensive battles against the Egyptian army along the Suez Canal during the Yom Kippur War. On October 7, 2023, its soldiers were called up for a 75-day mission in Gaza. In February, they were summoned for another 45-day reserve stint, with their battalions deployed to the West Bank and the Golan Heights. In July, they embarked on a third deployment—60 days in Gaza. 'The Jerusalem Brigade has been part of many historic moments in Israel’s history,' said Col. Nir Ifergan, 39, who took command of the brigade in June. 'Now, we’re fortunate to be part of writing another chapter.' 'On October 7,' recalled Lt. Col. (Res.) Paran Farah, 'Soldiers arrived even before they were officially called with emergency orders. We faced equipment shortages and maintenance issues, but we knew we had to head south as quickly as possible with whatever we had. People were determined—they grabbed their weapons, helmets, and rushed to the mission.' One of those soldiers was Capt. (Res.) Michal Fadler, 27, a technology and maintenance officer in Battalion 8119. 'I had friends at the Nova festival, and a close friend was killed in the fighting in the south—it was a Saturday filled with fear,' Fadler said. 'But I couldn’t stay away. I knew I had a responsibility.' Fadler, a student from Tel Aviv, is currently hospitalized at Soroka Medical Center in Be’er Sheva, undergoing rehabilitation after being moderately injured during the brigade’s third deployment in August. 'The Humvee in front of me hit a roadside bomb and exploded. I heard a massive blast, and at the same time, a terrorist squad appeared and started shooting at us,' she recounted. 'Leonid, the soldier with me, returned fire. Luckily, he wasn’t hit, but Maj. (res.) Yotam Itzhak Peled and Mordi and Sgt. Maj. (res.) Mordechai Yosef Ben Shoam were killed. Yotam was a beloved and admired commander, and Mordi was a skilled and humble fighter. Their families are a source of strength for us. I hope they never know more sorrow and that they take pride in their heroic sons.' Speaking about her injury, Capt. Fadler said, 'I was hit by shrapnel in the face. My mouth filled with blood, and I could barely speak. I radioed, ‘We’ve been hit, we’ve been ambushed, we’re injured.’ I arrived at Soroka conscious but in moderate condition. I underwent emergency surgery to remove the shrapnel. The injuries to my head affected my jaw, tongue, and neck. I was incredibly lucky that the nerves and spinal cord weren’t damaged. I understand firsthand the danger we’re facing. I’m still in the recovery process, but it’s hard to be in the hospital while our forces are out there. I hope that once I’m rehabilitated, I can return to the brigade.' 'That’s the spirit of our brigade,' Lt. Col. (Res.) Paran Farah said. 'I personally knew and commanded four of the soldiers we’ve lost. They understood the mission and responsibility, even though the cost was difficult and painful. We’re at war, and we know no one else can do this for us. That sense of duty to their comrades and the country is what drives our people.' It isn’t easy to serve 180 days a year and leave your personal life behind at a moment’s notice. 'The balance is broken,' said the brigade’s commander, Col. Ifergan. 'Our soldiers are now more reservists than civilians, and they grapple with feeling like ‘invisible citizens.’ The personal sacrifices we make must always be recognized by Israeli society. But alongside the difficulties—and there are many—my wife and I believe in the message we’re passing on to our children, in the values they’re growing up with. Even at a young age, they understand the need.' Lt. Col. (Res.) Paran Farah added, 'My parents have been evacuated from Rosh HaNikra for a year. How will they ever go home if we don’t show up and carry out our tasks?' Brigade Commander Col. Ifergan emphasized: 'We currently have the upper hand in Gaza, but the war’s objectives have not yet been achieved—the return of all hostages and the dismantling of Hamas’s capabilities. The work isn’t finished.'

IDF unveils new evidence of Hamas-Al Jazeera collaboration	Documents detail instructions from Hamas to Al Jazeera, including prohibiting criticism of Hamas, hiding information about failed rocket launches, and setting up a secure communication line between the two sides After revealing the affiliation of six Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza with Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the IDF on Thursday presented additional documents pointing to close collaboration between the terror organization and the Qatari news channel. The documents outline directives from Hamas to Al Jazeera, including barring criticism of Hamas, concealing failed rocket launches, and establishing a secure communication line between the two parties. One of the documents, from 2022, describes how Hamas gave Al Jazeera clear instructions on covering a failed Islamic Jihad rocket launch in Jabaliya that killed several Palestinians. Among the directives was a prohibition on using the word 'massacre' to describe the incident, along with advice to minimize the number of images shown and to prevent panelists from criticizing Hamas. 'We recommend you contact the Islamic Jihad leadership to understand the organization’s guidelines and highlight its efforts in manufacturing and developing capabilities,' Hamas wrote to the Qatari network. Another document from the same year reveals the instructions Hamas gave to journalist Tamer Almisshall regarding his coverage of the Islamic Jihad during Operation 'Breaking Dawn' on his program 'More Hidden than Revealed'. The instructions were to support the 'resistance' in Gaza and to prevent any criticism of the Islamic Jihad’s rocket capabilities, in light of the high number of failed launches. Additionally, a 2023 document shows Hamas decided to establish a 'Jazeera Phone'—a secure line for classified communication with the channel, particularly for emergencies. 'The documents reveal how Hamas directs Al Jazeera's media coverage to serve its own interests, preventing the public in Gaza and around the world from discovering the truth about its crimes against Gazan civilians,' an IDF statement said. Meanwhile, Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani was asked about the IDF’s allegations concerning Al Jazeera journalists’ involvement in terrorism. He responded, 'Al Jazeera must take action if there is any truth to Israel’s claims against its journalists.' At a press conference following his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, he added, 'These allegations should be treated with skepticism.' 'We are very proud of the Al Jazeera institution and its war coverage,' the Qatari prime minister continued. 'Al Jazeera operates according to the highest international standards of journalism. There is no justification for attacking journalists in conflict zones, and the excuses for doing so are unacceptable.' Blinken was also asked about the matter and said he could not verify the Israeli claims.

Antony Blinken says options to capitalize on this moment and the next steps to move the process forward were discussed; Qatari PM says Doha reached out to Hamas representatives U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday that negotiators will meet in the coming days to work on reaching a truce in Gaza as he again urged Israel and Hamas to strike a deal. 'We talked about options to capitalize on this moment and next steps to move the process forward, and I anticipate that our negotiators will be getting together in the coming days,' Blinken told reporters after talks with key mediator Qatar. Blinken’s visit to Doha follows earlier talks with leaders in Israel and Saudi Arabia. It marks his 11th visit to the region since the start of the war in Gaza after Hamas’s deadly October 7 attack last year. Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani said American and Israeli teams would travel to Qatar, without providing a specific timeline. 'A negotiating team from the United States will visit Doha alongside the negotiating team from the Israeli side to discuss the means by which a breakthrough can be achieved,' he said. Asked if Qatar had communicated with Hamas following the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the prime minister said: 'We re-engaged with them. There has been an engagement with the representatives from the political office in Doha.' 'We had some meetings with them in the last couple of days. I believe that until now, there is no clarity what will be the way forward.' Qatar, along with the U.S. and Egypt, has been leading mediation efforts between Israel and Palestinian terrorists, aiming to secure a Gaza truce and facilitate a hostage and prisoner exchange.

Macron rejects Netanyahu’s ‘civilization vs. barbarism’ framing i...	Speaking at international conference aimed at supporting Lebanon’s population, French president reiterates call for arms embargo on Israel, takes swipe at PM’s ‘war of civilizations’ narrative French President Emmanuel Macron took a swing at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, dismissing the Israeli leader's portrayal of the Israel-Hezbollah hostilities as a 'war between civilization and barbarism.' Responding to Netanyahu’s remarks in a French TV interview, Macron countered, 'I’ve heard recent talk of a ‘war of civilizations,’ but I believe there is a possibility for culture and civilization in the region.' Macron made the remark during an international conference in Paris to support Lebanon’s population and sovereignty amid ongoing hostilities. The French president reiterated his call for an immediate cease-fire and criticized Israel's continued operations in southern Lebanon and Beirut. He outlined four key goals for the conference: strengthening Lebanon’s sovereignty, providing humanitarian aid, reinforcing UN peacekeepers (UNIFIL) and supporting Lebanon's security forces. The conference saw participation from 54 countries, including EU members, Gulf states, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Japan and Australia. The U.S. was represented by deputy secretary of state after Secretary Antony Blinken and Special Envoy Amos Hochstein were unable to attend due to scheduling conflicts. Macron called for an end to hostilities, saying, 'The war must end quickly.' He condemned Hezbollah’s drone attack on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea and criticized Israel’s military operations in Lebanon, warning that a military offensive alone 'will not solve the problem.' Macron, who recently suggested an arms embargo on Israel, stressed the need to separate the Gaza war from hostilities in Lebanon. 'We must not export a war from another region to Lebanon,' Macron said. France pledged €100 million in aid to Lebanon, as part of the €426 million in needs assessed by the UN. Macron called for a return to UN Resolution 1701, which calls for the disarmament of militias in Lebanon and the deployment of Lebanese and UNIFIL troops along the Israel-Lebanon border, to restore peace and security. Macron expressed full support for UNIFIL, the UN peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, and condemned attacks on its personnel, saying, 'Nothing justifies the shelling of UNIFIL soldiers.' Regarding Lebanon’s military, Macron pledged France’s assistance in training and equipping 6,000 new soldiers at Lebanon’s request. He praised Lebanese security forces for their role in maintaining order and fighting ISIS, and called for political stability in Lebanon. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati urged the international community to expand its support, stressing that a cease-fire is essential for stability and the rebuilding of the nation. He reaffirmed Lebanon’s commitment to implementing UN Resolution 1701 and supporting the U.S.-French proposal for a 21-day cease-fire.

Israeli paratrooper reservists from the 646th Brigade uncovered an underground Hezbollah facility in southern Lebanon, intended to be used by the terrorist group's elite Radwan Force in its plan to 'conquer the Galilee,' the IDF said Thursday. The site contained bunk beds, storage cabinets, food supplies and infrastructure for long-term stays, as well as a significant cache of equipment, weapons and rocket launch pads left behind by the terrorists. In recent days, Israeli forces also discovered four weapons depots, some located in civilian homes, the military added. Among the seized arms were AK-47 rifles, ammunition, rockets, mortars, shoulder-fired missiles, RPGs and advanced anti-tank missiles.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1r11qnvxyl	2024-10-24T04:45:35-07:00

The Journal has called for an investigation into the matter, citing troubling details. The report describes growing concerns within the Hague-based court over Khan's handling of the Israeli cases. The Journal claims that Khan's intense efforts to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders may serve to distract from internal allegations of harassment.

Report: Warrants for Israeli leaders a smokescreen for ICC prosec...	Wall Street Journal report says Karim Khan, when confronted with sexual harassment allegations, initially said he'd 'have to resign' but instead allegedly threatened victim and witnesses; days later, he announced warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday published new details regarding sexual harassment allegations against International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan, which he links to what he calls a 'smear campaign' against his efforts to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. According to the report, Khan’s aggressive push for these arrest warrants is seen as an attempt to divert attention from the accusations against him. The Journal has called for an investigation into the matter, citing troubling details. The report describes growing concerns within the Hague-based court over Khan's handling of the Israeli cases. The Journal claims that Khan's intense efforts to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders may serve to distract from internal allegations of harassment. It warns that before the ICC's judges consider issuing such warrants, an internal investigation into the prosecutor himself should be conducted. According to the article, Khan's focus on Netanyahu and Gallant, while excluding political rival Benny Gantz—who was also a member of Israel's wartime cabinet—raises suspicions of bias. The Journal suggests that anti-Israel bias may explain the prosecutor's actions. The investigation also reveals that Khan had promised Western leaders a thorough probe into the Israel-Gaza conflict. He reportedly assured a group of U.S. senators that he would not rush to judgment before hearing Israel’s side, even scheduling meetings in Israel for May 20. However, instead of visiting Israel, Khan appeared on CNN to announce his intent to pursue arrest warrants. The Journal attributes Khan's sudden shift to allegations of sexual harassment that surfaced weeks before his announcement. According to the report, the ICC remained silent on these claims for over five months, until an anonymous social media account brought them to light last week. The alleged victim, a junior staff member in Khan’s office, reported repeated harassment, including being locked in his office and subjected to inappropriate physical contact. A report submitted to the ICC’s independent oversight body, obtained by the newspaper, includes disturbing details of Khan’s behavior, such as entering the woman’s hotel room late at night and lying on her bed under the pretense of checking on her well-being. The report was filed by a colleague of the alleged victim, who worked directly under Khan. When confronted with the allegations, Khan reportedly appeared shocked and confused. According to a witness, the prosecutor expressed surprise and remarked that he would 'have to resign.' However, instead of stepping down, Khan and his wife allegedly began applying pressure on the whistleblower, including demanding that he leave for Uganda. The Journal also highlights that the ICC’s oversight mechanism acknowledged the reported incident in its annual report on October 18 but determined that no investigation was necessary, as the alleged victim had refused to pursue a formal complaint. The article questions this decision, suggesting that fear of retaliation may have prevented the victim from proceeding with the case. It calls for an investigation, arguing that if the allegations are proven true, they would cast serious doubt on Khan’s integrity and the ICC’s commitment to impartial justice. An unnamed Israeli official responded to the report, stating: 'The picture is becoming clearer. The entire issue of war crimes and the ICC’s decision to pursue arrest warrants against the prime minister and defense minister is an attempt to cover up sexual harassment accusations against Karim Khan. 'He misled U.S. senators when he said he would not act against Israel before visiting and hearing its side. He canceled his visit in May and rushed to announce his decision instead. By targeting Israel and its leaders, Khan is trying to gain favor with the global progressive left and shield himself from the accusations.' Khan has denied the harassment allegations, telling the Daily Mail last week, 'I absolutely can confirm there is no truth to suggestions of misconduct.'

Israel's retaliatory strike on Iran delayed due to Pentagon docum...	According to British daily The Times, leak forced Israel to revise plans and develop alternative strategy; 'There will be a retaliation, but it has taken longer than it was supposed to take,' intelligence source says Israel’s planned retaliatory strike on Iran has been delayed due to the leak of classified Pentagon documents detailing the specifics of the operation, British daily The Times reported on Thursday, citing an intelligence source familiar with Israel’s preparations. The leak, initially shared on a pro-Iran Telegram channel and later on X (formerly Twitter), included details about Israel’s plans to use ballistic missiles against Iran, helping Tehran anticipate the attack patterns. The report indicates that the leak forced Israel to revise its plans and develop an alternative strategy. 'The leak of the American documents delayed the attack due to the need to change certain strategies and components,' the source said. 'There will be a retaliation, but it has taken longer than it was supposed to take.' Israel had been preparing to target Iranian Revolutionary Guard military installations but had assured the U.S. that its response would not involve Iran's nuclear or oil infrastructure. The planned strike would be a retaliation for Tehran’s October 1 attack, which saw over 180 ballistic missiles fired at Israel. The leaked documents, classified as 'top secret' and dated October 15 and 16, were verified by U.S. officials. They detail Israeli military preparations, including a large-scale air force deployment exercise and an aerial refueling drill. The documents also refer to Israeli handling of air-launched ballistic missiles, with at least 16 missiles, codenamed 'Golden Horizon,' and 40 others called 'ISO2' or 'Rocks,' being prepared for use, the latter a surface-to-air missile developed by Israeli defense contractor Rafael. According to Rafael’s website, the Rocks missile is designed to hit targets from long distances, traveling at supersonic speeds, and is capable of penetrating well-protected underground sites. The documents were compiled by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) and detailed Israeli military movements, including missile exercises and air force maneuvers in preparation for a potential strike on Iran. The absence of accompanying satellite images in the leaked files has led to speculation about how the information was obtained and disseminated. The Pentagon has denied reports that Ariane Tabatabai, a U.S. Defense Department official of Iranian heritage, was behind the leak, as had been suggested in an earlier Sky News Arabia report. Pentagon spokesman Patrick Ryder confirmed that Tabatabai was not under investigation, while emphasizing that the department is fully cooperating with the inquiry into the classified documents. The leak has heightened tensions between Israel and the U.S., with former Israeli intelligence officials warning of the broader implications. 'The real harm is that it shows the U.S. is struggling to keep secrets,' a former Israeli official told CNN. As part of the ongoing investigation, U.S. authorities are examining who had access to the leaked documents, which were circulated on social media and picked up by major news outlets like CNN. The leak comes amid growing concerns about Iran’s activities in the region, including its support for Hezbollah and proxy militias in Iraq and Syria. Israel has been preparing for potential military action, particularly following reports earlier this year of a similar Israeli strike that allegedly destroyed an air defense radar near Isfahan after an Iranian attack in April.

The machine that saved Pablo's life on October 7	At 6 a.m., Rafi Litwak finished his shift at the Microgil quarry, leaving Pablo Dulitzky alone to take over; shortly after, sirens blared, and Pablo recalls seeing dozens of terrorists pouring into their kibbutz; his quick thinking saved his life Pablo Dulitzky had long planned where he would hide if terrorists ever attacked. Since a previous warning about an infiltration, he had a spot in mind, much like his colleague, Rafi Litwak. 'I planned to hide in the electrical closet,' Rafi, 38, from Be’er Sheva, shared. The two men work at Microgil, a quarry plant adjacent to Kibbutz Nir Oz. On the morning of the attack, Pablo, 61, the only worker at the plant that day, found himself hiding for hours. Rafi, who had just finished his shift, had left five minutes before the terrorists arrived. 'My shift started at 6 p.m. on Friday,' Rafi recalled from the control room, where security camera feeds monitor the plant. 'At 4 a.m., I felt tired and went up to the roof to get some air. It was a quiet night, peaceful and even a bit boring. Pablo arrived at 5 a.m., as usual, for coffee and a chat. We hugged, exchanged shifts and I said, 'See you tomorrow.' 'Then, just minutes later, I heard explosions and interceptors in the sky, like fireworks. Normally, I’d pull over and lie down, but this time there was an alarm in Be’er Sheva, so I decided to drive straight home to my wife and kids. That saved my life. Just minutes later, at the Meon Junction, terrorists killed a family driving there. By 7 a.m., I reached home, only to hear that terrorists had breached Nir Oz. I called Pablo, but he didn’t answer. I feared the worst.' 'When Rafi left,' Pablo described, 'I sat in the control room, preparing for the day. Suddenly, 'Boom-boom-boom,' and a Red Alert siren. I ran outside, and bullets rained down on me like it was pouring rain,' he said in his thick Argentine accent. 'I ran back to the control room and saw through the cameras that dozens of terrorists were entering Nir Oz. I called Yossi Vahav, the plant manager, and said, 'Yossi, there are terrorists in the kibbutz.' He thought I was joking. I sent him a video.' Moments later, Pablo watched in horror as four terrorists breached the plant's gate. 'One of them stole my motorcycle. I shut off all the machines to keep quiet and watched as they brutally killed people at the gate of Nir Oz. I saw my death right in front of me. But I didn’t feel fear. My adrenaline kicked in, and I was laser-focused. I just stared at the stone crusher machine.' Between iron chains and conveyor belts Lying between iron chains and conveyor belts that moved stones, Dulitzky listened as terrorists looted the plant and shouted 'Allahu Akbar,' knowing that stepping out would mean death. 'I climbed inside the machine, and for hours I saw the terrorists and heard everything, but they didn’t see me,' he recalled. 'They stole everything that wasn’t bolted down, even throwing a forklift against the gate. I knew I couldn’t leave.' As the attack unfolded, Dulitzky texted his daughter, an IDF officer, who was on her way to her base when the alarms sounded. Plant managers had contacted the military, and friends spoke to the police, all telling him to wait. Dulitzky, without food or water, took refuge inside the machine. Twice, when the terrorists weren’t nearby, he ventured out to grab two cucumbers and a small bottle of water, which he refilled from a toilet tank and drank sparingly. By 6 p.m., terrorists reentered the plant, looting and firing their weapons calmly, as Dulitzky's phone battery miraculously held on. 'I just kept thinking about getting out to my family,' he said. Rescue finally came around midnight, after nearly 12 hours in hiding. 'One of the managers told me the forces were on their way,' Dulitzky said. 'I told him, ‘If they don’t say exactly, 'Pablo, IDF, come out now' in that order, I’m not coming out.’ They called and said it just like that, and I knew they were at the gate.' When asked if he was injured, Dulitzky replied, 'No, just get me out of here.' Though safe, he continued to hear gunfire in his head for days after the ordeal. Back to work From the rooftop of their plant, Pablo and Rafi stood silently, gazing toward Gaza. Two months after the October 7 terrorist attack, the longtime colleagues reunited for the first time, following Dulitzky’s trip to Argentina. 'When I returned, I felt the weight of everything on me,' said Dulitzky. 'I realized I needed help because I wasn’t feeling well. Talking to someone helps a lot.' Litwak had resumed work earlier. 'We met again during a shift change,' Litwak recalled. 'We made coffee, just like we did the morning of October 7. But this time, we talked, each sharing our story, and couldn’t believe we survived. I think about how I made it out by minutes, and how he was stuck here but made it through.'

Germany to provide extra 96 million euros in Lebanon aid, says fo...	Germany will provide a further 96 million euros ($103.57 million) in humanitarian and development aid to Lebanon, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Thursday ahead of a meeting of some 70 delegations in Paris focused on helping the country. 'We are making it clear that we not only see the suffering in Lebanon these days, we are taking action; we are supporting the people on the ground who, for the most part, want only one thing: to live in safety and peace in the future, just like so many people in Israel,' added Baerbock. France is hoping that the meeting will raise about 500 million euros ($540 million) in humanitarian aid, according to a French foreign ministry framework document for the conference.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyn00otwl1x	2024-10-24T01:56:00-07:00

France will provide a 100-million euro ($108-million) aid package to support Lebanon, French President Emmanuel Macron told an international conference Thursday in Paris. Macron said, 'in the immediate term, massive aid is needed for the Lebanese population, both for the hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the war and for the communities hosting them.' The war between Hezbollah terrorists and Israel has displaced a million people in the country, killed over 2,500 and deepened an economic crisis. French organizers hope participants' financial pledges of humanitarian aid will meet the $426 million the United Nations says is urgently needed. Paris also seeks to help restore Lebanon's sovereignty and strengthen its institutions.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjnmiywx1e	2024-10-24T01:54:57-07:00

The injured were evacuated to the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya. Sirens warning of rocket and missile fire were triggered in Nahariya and several towns across the Western Galilee, including Shlomi, Klil and Kabri, among others. Additional alarms were sounded in the Upper Galilee, including Kibbutz Malkia and Moshav Dovev. The IDF reported that approximately 50 rockets were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel, with some intercepted and others hitting open areas. Meanwhile, Israeli Air Force fighter jets, guided by precise intelligence, struck multiple Hezbollah military sites in Beirut's Dahieh district overnight. These sites, used for the production and storage of weapons, were located within and beneath civilian buildings in heavily populated areas. 'This is yet another example of Hezbollah's cynical exploitation of Lebanese civilians and infrastructure as human shields,' an IDF spokesperson said, noting that several precautionary measures, including advance warnings to civilians, were taken to minimize casualties. Meanwhile, the IDF said that Israeli fighter jets, guided by precise intelligence from the Military Intelligence Directorate, targeted several Hezbollah military sites used for the production and storage of weapons in the Dahieh district of Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold.

Suspects, including one from Iraq, allegedly paid 50,000 Sri Lankan rupees to execute attack; arrest made based on intelligence received from India's spy agency Sri Lankan authorities arrested two individuals overnight Thursday on suspicion of planning a terror attack targeting Israeli tourists in the Arugam Bay area, following a severe travel warning issued by Israel’s National Security Council the day before. According to local reports, the Sri Lankan defense forces received intelligence from India's spy agency about a planned attack on Israelis between October 19-23 in Arugam Bay. One of the suspects is believed to have traveled from Iraq, and investigators discovered that one of the two detainees had previously been imprisoned on international drug trafficking charges. Authorities also revealed that the suspects were allegedly paid 50,000 Sri Lankan rupees ($170) to carry out the attack. The travel warning issued by Israel on Wednesday urged all Israelis to immediately leave the Arugam Bay area and coastal regions in southern and western Sri Lanka due to 'updated information on a specific terror threat targeting tourist areas and beaches.' Officials said the intelligence indicated an imminent attack, describing it as a 'hot alert' similar to a foiled Iranian plot to target Israelis in Turkey during the summer of 2022.

Alan Yazbek was photographed at the Oct. 6 rally in Sydney's central business district holding a sign that replaced the Star of David on the Israeli flag with a blue swastika, accompanied by the words 'Stop Nazi Israel.' The 56-year-old Yazbek was also photographed holding another sign in the green and yellow colors associated with Hezbollah — a designated terrorist organization in Australia — with the words 'our boys in green and gold will win.' The rally took place a day before the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, carried out by Hamas. Yazbek — the co-founder of the Nomad Group, which owns three high-end restaurants in Sydney and Melbourne — was the only person charged following the rally, which saw an estimated 10,000 people in attendance. Police initially tried to prevent the rally but later reached an agreement with organizers, allowing it to proceed peacefully. Yazbek faces a potential sentence of up to 12 months in jail or a fine of 11,000 Australian dollars ($7,300). He is due to be sentenced on Dec. 10.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjqfwivgje	2024-10-23T22:15:54-07:00

IDF targets Beirut's Dahieh after rocket volley to central Israel	Lebanese media reports wave of airstrikes in Hezbollah's stronghold in the country after terror group fired four rockets toward Tel Aviv and surrounding area Lebanese reports on Wednesday reported significant airstrikes were seen in Beirut’s Dahieh district, considered to be Hezbollah’s stronghold in Lebanon, following the terror group’s targeting of central Israel with four rockets fired at the area earlier. The strikes come after the IDF’s Arabic Spokesperson Col. Avichay Adraee called on residents of the area to evacuate prior to the military’s actions. Footage from the scene showed massive explosions and smoke plumes. Following Hezbollah’s firing toward central Israel, Palestinian sources reported late Wednesday one rocket fell in the West Bank town of Qalqilya, resulting in one man receiving minor injuries. The two sides continue to escalate the conflict in the area amid the war in Gaza. Hezbollah said in an earlier statement, published via its operations room, that it used 'precision missiles' and new types of drones for the first time in their clashes against IDF troops. The terror group said it had been able to push back Israeli troops in clashes in several border villages in southern Lebanon. However, the organization had made several such claims in the past that were proven inaccurate. Meanwhile, Saudi news outlet Al-Hadath reported that an earlier IDF strike in Beirut was aimed at the offices of Hezbollah-affiliated network Al-Mayadeen. According to a Lebanese source talking to Reuters, the strike destroyed an office used by the pro-Iran Al-Mayadeen broadcaster. Two other security sources confirmed the office had been hit in an IDF strike on a multi-story building.

The world is watching, do not fail us': Former Israeli hostage s...	Amit Soussana addresses ambassadors in special event on sexual violence in conflict, recalling her assault by a Hamas terrorist while in captivity Former Israeli hostage Amit Soussana, who was released in the first hostage deal with Hamas after 55 days in captivity, addressed UN ambassadors in a special event held at the international body’s New York headquarters. 'I was held captive alone, chained by my ankle with a metal chain, unable to move, and had to ask for permission to use the bathroom,' Soussana recounted. 'In that house, I was sexually assaulted by the Hamas terrorist who guarded me. He forced me to go to the shower and entered the room, pointed his gun at me. He was breathing heavily and had a monstrous, beast-like face.' 'I knew exactly what he was planning to do, and yet I couldn’t do anything to prevent it. I was utterly helpless. When the assault was over, I wasn’t even allowed to cry or to be sad. I had no one to comfort me and was forced to act nice to the person who had just sexually assaulted me in the most horrifying way,' she added. 'Not a day goes by that I don't think about what that terrible man did to me. We were held in such inhumane conditions. No person should ever be subjected such brutal and ruthless treatment.' 'Now, I speak before the UN Security Council pleading with you to fulfill your duty. Take immediate action to secure the release of those still held captive. Every day that passes steals another piece of their soul and endangers their life. Act now before it's too late, I urge you: do not turn a blind eye to the atrocities being committed against innocent civilians,' she said. 'It is your responsibility to protect human rights, to combat terrorism and to bring those responsible for these heinous crimes to justice. The world is watching, waiting for the UN Security Council to live up to its mandate. I beg you, do not fail us. Secure the freedom of the hostages and ensure that no one else would suffer the same fate,' she called on the international body. 'Remember, it is our collective duty to combat terrorism and protect human rights. The time to act is now.' Soussana spoke at a special event held at the UN to mark 15 years of the mandate on sexual violence in conflicts, organized by the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict Pramila Patten. Patten was behind the report released earlier this year by the UN regarding the horrific rapes and sexual violence committed by Hamas terrorists during the October 7 massacre. In her speech, Patten reiterated her report’s recommendations published last April, which also called for the unconditional release of all hostages, an immediate cease-fire and the facilitation of an independent investigation of sexual violence by Hamas in order to bring the guilty to justice. 'Amit Soussana bravely shared the horrors, the violence, the sexual violence and the sheer evil she experienced from the moment she was abducted from her apartment in Kibbutz Kfar Aza until her release from Hamas captivity,' Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said during the event. 'Amit, you're strong, powerful and inspiring. Thank you for sharing your story with the world and exposing once again the true face of the Hamas terror organization. It's important to remember that the IDF’s stretched arm will reach anyone associated with Hamas and eliminate them. We won't stop until the release of all 101 hostages held by Hamas.'

Caught between sympathy and fear: Egypt’s Christians confront the...	Egypt’s Coptic Orthodox Christians are torn between support for Palestinian civilians and fear of Hamas, complicating their response to the ongoing war A year after Hamas’s October 2023 assault on Israel, Egypt’s Coptic Orthodox Christians remain divided over how to respond to the ongoing war in Gaza. As the Middle East’s largest Christian community, Copts are caught between sympathy for Palestinian civilians and deep fears of Hamas, the Islamist group linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, whose rule in Egypt was marked by violence against Christians. Coptic Christians make up Egypt’s largest Christian minority and the largest Christian population in the Middle East. Most belong to the Coptic Orthodox Church, which traces its roots to the early days of Christianity in Egypt. Egypt is also home to a significant population of Evangelical Christians, whose church, founded as a mission in the 19th century, is the largest Protestant denomination in the Arab world. Despite their numbers, both Copts and Evangelicals face ongoing sectarian violence. On August 31, 2024, a fire at the Coptic Diocese of Beni Suef destroyed the building and injured several people, though no lives were lost. While authorities blamed faulty wiring, many in the Christian community remain skeptical, citing a history of arson attacks on churches. 'My friend from the supermarket downstairs asked me about the Christian position on what he called Israeli aggression in Gaza,' said Isaac Ibrahim, a Copt writer in Cairo. 'He wanted to know if our solidarity with Palestine had shifted since the death of Pope Shenouda.' The late Pope Shenouda III, head of the Coptic Church from 1971 until his death in 2012, forbade Copts from visiting Israel, reflecting the pan-Arab stance of the time. His successor, Pope Tawadros II, has taken a more cautious approach, aligning the Church’s position with Egypt’s official diplomatic policies. 'Pope Tawadros doesn’t want to provoke conflict,' said John Gabriel, an Egyptian Dominican priest, speaking to The Media Line from a Franciscan monastery in Leuven, Belgium. 'He follows the government’s line, condemning violence on both sides but avoiding the hardline rhetoric of the past.' This shift has created a more muted stance within the Coptic Church, but divisions remain. While older Copts hold onto anti-Israel sentiments from Shenouda’s era, younger Copts are more skeptical of Hamas and other Islamist groups. For many Christians, Hamas’ role as a leader in the global 'Palestine solidarity' movement complicates support for the Palestinian cause. 'Because of the Brotherhood’s treatment of us, some Copts see Jews as similarly persecuted by Islamic extremists,' Gabriel told The Media Line. 'They ask, ‘Why defend Palestinians when groups like Hamas, who terrorized us, are leading the fight?’' Makarios Lahzy, a Cairo-based human rights lawyer, says the complex dynamics of the Arab-Israeli conflict put Christians in a difficult position. 'Christians in the East are weakened and exhausted,' Lahzy told The Media Line. 'For centuries, we’ve been blackmailed and accused of disloyalty, leading most to become confused and hide. Some Christians exaggerate their hostility towards Israel to avoid such accusations, while others align with Israel as a defense against Islamic domination.' Lahzy warns that rising support for Hamas in Egypt, especially after the killing of Hamas political leader Yahya Sinwar, could embolden Islamist factions within Egypt. 'The backing Sinwar receives from the Arab street reflects a deep-rooted anti-Jewish sentiment in the Islamic mindset,' he told The Media Line. 'What worries us is that glorifying Hamas could turn Islamist factions in Egypt back toward Christians.' Tensions are heightened by official statements from Al-Azhar, Egypt’s top Islamic authority, which has framed the conflict in religious terms. After Sinwar’s assassination, Al-Azhar mourned him as a 'martyr of the Palestinian resistance.' 'When Al-Azhar talks about Jerusalem in terms of jihad and resistance, it taps into old fears of Islamist violence,' Gabriel said. 'It’s not just about foreign policy—it raises fears of a revival of sectarian violence in Egypt itself.' The ongoing war in Gaza has reignited theological debates within Egypt’s Christian community. 'Palestinian Theology,' a Christian liberation theology that ties the Palestinian struggle to biblical themes of freedom, has been met with strong opposition from many Copts. 'It’s not theology—it’s a political movement with an antisemitic agenda,' said Bassem Al-Janoubie, a liberal Coptic commentator, speaking to The Media Line. 'It’s driven by the fusion of progressive European and North American Lutheran evangelical ideology and political Islam.' One of the most contentious aspects of this theology is the portrayal of Jesus as a Palestinian. 'Jesus was a Jewish king, born of royal blood,' Al-Janoubie told The Media Line. 'To suggest he was Palestinian is to deny his role as the Messiah, as depicted in the Gospels.' This theological friction adds to the wider tensions within Egypt’s Christian community. 'Yes, Jesus was in Palestine, but it was the land of Israel,' Gabriel said. 'For many Christians here, there’s no distinction between biblical Israel and the modern state.' These theological and political divisions are mirrored by practical concerns about security and sectarian violence. The fire at the Coptic Diocese of Beni Suef, though officially attributed to an electrical fault, has sparked fears of a return to the days when attacks on Christian churches were more frequent. Muslim arson attacks on Coptic churches have a long history, with nearly 1,000 churches attacked or torched since the 1970s. The war in Gaza, meanwhile, has only deepened these anxieties. 'If Hamas wins, many of us fear that Islamists here will turn their attention back to us,' Gabriel warned. 'It’s like a nightmare scenario: what if the flames spread to Egypt?' A year after the October 7 attacks, Egypt’s Coptic Christians remain divided. While many sympathize with Palestinian civilians, fears of Hamas and political Islam make it difficult to take a clear stance. 'We share the Arab world’s sympathy for the Palestinian people,' Gabriel told The Media Line, 'but we’re also fearful of what groups like Hamas represent for us as Christians.'

Iranian president threatens Israel on BRICS sideline	Masoud Pezeshkian in Russia visit swears damage to Israel would be 'unimaginable' should it attack Tehran in response to its ballistic missile attack; Gallant visits airbase hinting at close retaliation Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the BRICS international summit in Russia on Wednesday, warned Israel against a powerful response against Tehran following its missile attack on the country on October 1. 'If Israel makes a mistake, Iran will respond with force. Israel might cause us some damage, but the response it will suffer and the scale of damage inflicted will be unimaginable,' Pezeshkian said. His remarks came shortly after Defense Minister Yoav Gallant reiterated Israel would strike Iran in response to its ballistic missile attack earlier this month. He made his statement during a meeting with pilots and technical staff at the Israel Air Force’s Hatzor Airbase. 'After we strike in Iran, people in Israel and elsewhere will understand what your preparation, readiness and capabilities entail. We have very high confidence in your abilities, both individually and as a team, as well as complete confidence in the IDF,' Gallant said against the backdrop of leaked U.S. intelligence documents detailing some of Israel's preparations for an attack on Tehran. Gallant's office added that the minister received a briefing on operational activities across all combat zones at Hatzor Airbase from the base’s commander, Brig. Gen. Amichai Levin and squadron commanders, including 'increased readiness for potential offensive actions in other fronts.' It was also reported Gallant spoke with air and ground crews, expressing his appreciation for their wartime activities over the past year. 'You have the privilege of participating in the seven-front war, and the IDF and the Air Force are present in all these fronts — Gaza, Lebanon, the West Bank, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Iran,' Gallant told the pilots. 'They've paid a heavy price wherever they've tried to harm us. Those who had dreams of defeating us and striking us in Gaza a year ago are no longer living after (Yahya) Sinwar and a long line of leaders have been eliminated, thanks the IDF’s actions,' he added. Meanwhile, U.S. efforts are ongoing to moderate Israel's response to Iran, aiming to prevent a dramatic escalation just before the November presidential elections. Secretary of State Antony Blinken requested that Israel further temper its response to Iran during a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday. According to reports, the attack is already expected to focus on military assets in Tehran rather than Iran's nuclear or oil facilities. Blinken also urged an end to the IDF’s ground operation in Lebanon, advising Israel to leverage its military gains and turn them into strategic achievements. 'The campaign’s management is in Israel's hands,' an Israeli official said in response.

IDF exposes six Al Jazeera journalist as Gazan terrorists	Military reveals documents detailing names of reporters belonging to Qatari network affiliated with Hamas and Islamic Jihad activity in the Strip before and during October 7 The IDF reported on Wednesday that military intelligence and documents located in the Gaza Strip confirmed the affiliation of six Al Jazeera network journalists in Gaza with Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The reporters include Anas Jamal Mahmoud Al-Sharif, Alaa Abdul Aziz Muhammad Salama, Hossam Basel Abdul Karim Shabat, Ashraf Sami Ashour Saraj, Ismail Farid Muhammad Abu Omar and Talal Mahmoud Abdul Rahman Aruki. 'The terrorist-journalist Ismail Farid Muhammad Abu Omar was struck and injured a few months ago in Gaza. The documents once again confirm his involvement in terrorist activities. The Al Jazeera network has attempted to disassociate itself from Omar's terror activities,' the military said in a statement. In a 2021 list of Hamas operatives, Abu Omar was described as a platoon commander in Hamas’ Khan Yunis Brigade. He is known for accompanying the terrorists on October 7 and documenting the massacre at Kibbutz Nir Oz in real-time. After being injured, he was transferred for treatment in Qatar. The documents include personnel tables, lists of terror training courses, phone directories and salary records for terrorists, clearly proving their roles as military operatives in Gazan terror groups. For example, Alaa Salama's name appears in a 2022 salary document for Islamic Jihad operatives, and Talal Aruki is mentioned in a 2019 injury tracking document describing he suffered a fracture in his right leg bone, which was treated with a splint. 'These documents serve as proof of the integration of Hamas terrorists within the Qatari Al Jazeera media network,' The military added. 'Most of the journalists that the IDF has exposed as operatives in Hamas's military wing spearhead the propaganda for Hamas at Al Jazeera, especially in the northern Gaza Strip.'

Three killed in attack on Turkish aerospace industries headquarte...	Footage broadcast on local media shows several armed assailants entering TUSAS complex, where gunfire and loud explosion reported; interior minister describes incident as 'terrorist attack'; sources indicate hostage situation An attack on the Turkish Aerospace Industries (TUSAS) headquarters near Ankara on Wednesday left three people dead and five others wounded, officials confirmed on Wednesday. The assault, which occurred in the Kahramankazan district, targeted one of Turkey's most critical defense and aviation facilities. Selim Cirpanoglu, the mayor of Kahramankazan, reported the casualties during an interview with Turkish TV channel Tele1. Footage broadcast on local media showed several armed assailants entering the TUSAS complex, where gunfire and a loud explosion were reported. Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya described the incident on social media platform X, calling it a 'terrorist attack' and expressing condolences for the 'martyrs and injured.' He provided no details about the perpetrators, and the motive behind the attack remains unclear. Initial media reports suggested a suicide bomber may have been involved, and some sources indicated that hostages could have been taken. However, these details have not been confirmed by officials. Witnesses at the scene told Reuters that employees were escorted to shelters, and exits were sealed off amid reports that explosions had occurred near multiple building exits as workers were leaving for the day. Private broadcaster NTV reported that the attackers arrived in a taxi during a shift change, detonating a bomb at the entrance before entering the facility armed with assault rifles. At least one woman was among the assailants, according to security camera footage, which showed attackers in plain clothes carrying backpacks and rifles. State-owned Anadolu Agency reported that emergency services, including security forces, ambulances, and firefighters, were quickly dispatched to the site. Helicopters were seen circling above the premises, and a gunfight was reported in the complex’s parking lot. TUSAS, a state-run company that produces both civilian and military aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other defense systems, employs more than 10,000 people. It is responsible for key projects such as KAAN, Turkey's first national combat aircraft. Prosecutors have launched an investigation into the attack, and authorities are working to determine whether Kurdish militants, the Islamic State group or leftist extremists, all of which have previously carried out attacks in Turkey, may have been involved.

The secret Hezbollah tried to bury: Unmasking the Golan File	Established in 2018, unit attempted to operate covertly in Golan Heights while evading Israeli intelligence; however, military ultimately delivered crushing blow to group's activities Although Hezbollah spent the last few years focusing on its 'plan to conquer the Galilee,' the terror organization had also been planning a similar attack on the eastern sector of Israel's northern border. While fighting continues in southern Lebanon, the IDF is also operating in Syria to neutralize the threat in the Golan Heights, known as the Golan File. On October 9, the IDF eliminated Golan File member Adham Jahata in an airstrike. This terrorist operative had passed intelligence from the Syrian regime and Syrian frontlines to Hezbollah, enabling the Lebanese terror group to act against Israel through the Golan. His assassination adds to a series of countermeasures carried out by the IDF since the unit was first exposed in the winter of 2019, shortly after its formation. How is a terrorist organization created? Like most terror groups, the Golan File began as an idea: to establish an elite force that would plan and execute terror activities against Israeli civilians through the Syrian border. The unit was intended to serve as an intelligence-gathering branch, avoiding detection by the IDF, and launching attacks when ready. The current leader of the Golan File is Ali Musa Abbas Daqduq, also known by the call sign Abu Hussein Sajed. He was chosen due to his extensive history with Hezbollah. In addition to supporting attacks from Lebanon on Israel in the 2000s, he trained Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force. Later, he was sent to Iraq by the organization to build a terror network targeting U.S. forces. In the summer of 2018, Hezbollah noticeably shifted its operations in the Golan Heights, turning the idea into reality. A covert unit was established, with constant operational readiness to strike Israel at a moment’s notice. Hezbollah accomplished this using existing terror cells in southern Syria, undetected by the Syrian regime. However, the unit’s secrecy did not last long. Israeli intelligence quickly identified the threat and revealed its existence to the Israeli public and the wider world in March 2019. A look inside the operation Over the years, the IDF continued to gather intelligence, closely monitoring and combating the threat in secret. The Golan File resurfaced in the headlines in January 2023 when IDF forces captured Ghaith Abdullah, a Syrian resident and operative of the unit, while he crossed into Israel. During interrogation, Abdullah confessed to his involvement and identified three other operatives: Maan Al-Hamad, Abu Jud and Abu Hassan Al-Asha, the unit's Syrian recruiter known by the call sign Abu Ali. He detailed his recruitment process and the mechanics of how Syrian collaborators were activated. Hezbollah’s recruitment of local supporters relies on two main strategies: identifying Syrians with a history of anti-Israel terrorism and exploiting the poor living conditions in Syria by offering financial incentives in exchange for intelligence on IDF activities. Operation Cash Cab 'At the start of the war in October, we received reports that the Golan File had begun to mobilize,' recalled one IDF intelligence officer. 'Prior to October, they had been preparing. That day, they received the order to act.' In those first hours of uncertainty, the IDF quickly recognized the gravity of the situation and began formulating plans to foil the terrorist plot. For months, they conducted close surveillance on suspects, culminating in a decisive operation in December. 'We identified a Syrian man suspected of collaborating with Hezbollah in Quneitra, southern Syria,' the officer recalled. 'When we learned Lebanese operatives were joining him at the Syrian front, we knew this was no innocent meeting and acted to thwart the threat.' IDF surveillance tracked the Syrian collaborator's yellow taxi, and once all four terrorists—three Lebanese operatives and one Syrian—were confirmed to be inside, the vehicle was struck from the air. The operation, which killed Abu Al-Julan, a Syrian operative, and three Lebanese operatives—Abu Tarab, Abbas and Jawad Daqduq, the son of the unit's commander—was dubbed Operation Cash Cab. Intelligence officials described the strike as 'the hardest blow to the Golan File since its inception.' According to sources, the message remains clear: any enemy threatening Israel’s security, whether in Lebanon, Syria or elsewhere, will be eliminated by the IDF.

Hezbollah fires 25 rockets toward Nahariya, man seriously injured	IDF reports dozens of rockets were seen crossing into the country in fresh salvo fired from Lebanon; Israeli seriously injured after being hit by interceptor shrapnel A 50-year-old Israeli man was seriously injured on Wednesday after an interceptor shrapnel hit his head in Nahariya, located in northern Israel. The IDF Spokesperson's Unit also reported that 25 rockets were launched toward the city, Golan Heights and Western Galilee regions from Lebanon. Sirens also sounded in Hadera, located further south. The military added two launches were located targeting Tiberias and Afula and were both intercepted with no injuries reported. Magen David Adom (MDA) paramedics who arrived at the scene provided the man with preliminary medical care before evacuating him to the Galilee Medical Center in the city. 'We saw the man lying on the edge of the pier, unconscious and suffering from a severe head injury,' Magen David Adom paramedic Nir Dayai recounted. 'A passerby had bandaged the injured man with the guidance of the MDA's hotline and managed to stop the significant bleeding from his head.' 'He told us that the injury was caused by shrapnel from the latest rocket barrage interception. We transferred him to the MDA intensive care unit while providing him with medical treatment and evacuated him to the hospital. His condition is serious but stable,' he added.

Hundreds of people were running in every direction, and every fe...	Nova music festival massacre survivor Danielle Gelbaum vividly recalls the terrifying moments as thousands desperately fled while rockets and gunfire rained down around them Of all the October 7 horrors, the massacre at the Nova music festival stands out in its scale, cruelty and its perpetrators’ inhumanity. That morning’s music festival site and its surrounding areas through which the partygoers tried to flee endured one of history’s most deadly terrorist attacks. Three hundred and eighty-three people were murdered, 44 were kidnapped to the Gaza Strip and hundreds were wounded. This is Nova survivor, 23-year-old Danielle Gelbaum’s story. 'I’d returned from my big trip to South America three weeks before Nova. I traveled to the festival with my elder sister Lior and friends. We started feeling tired at 5:30, so we went to where the tent was and my sister went to sleep in the tent. The music stopped at 6:29 and Red Alert sirens went off.' 'A few minutes later, we were all told to pack up and leave, so we got into the car and started driving toward the exit. We got onto Route 232 and were about to turn left to Kibbutz Be’eri. We had no idea there were terrorists around. After driving for a few minutes, we saw cars turning back but didn’t understand what was going on. We also turned around. 'A few minutes later, we saw cars just stopping in the middle of the road and people running out. When we got out of the car, I heard the first gunshots. My sister looked at me and asked, 'Dani, is that what gunfire sounds like?' 'We saw people running and we started running with them. Someone, presumably from the security detail, was standing on a mound shouting to everyone, 'Run east, run toward the sun.' This is one of the things that saved us. We saw a big black vehicle driving toward us, so we stopped it and asked to get in. It was two guys from the rave. I’ve no idea how they survived. We drove for a few minutes and again reached a dead end: the fields were all plowed up and cars just couldn't get through.' 'I clearly remember seeing a girl standing outside the truck signaling us to help her, and we just couldn’t. The gunfire wasn’t letting up and we knew that if we were to stop now, that would be the end for everyone in the truck. To this day, I don’t know what happened to her. I eat myself away inside over this. It will be with me forever.' 'When we got out of the car, I realized the scale of what was going on. Nearby, I saw hundreds of people running in every direction, and every few seconds, someone would fall. I looked the other way and saw a terrorist in a green shirt walking calmly and two meters in front of him, I saw someone in a black T-shirt run and fall to the ground. He managed to get up, took another couple of steps and then just collapsed to the ground again. I’ll never forget that scene. This was when we realized how close it was. We saw the terrorists with our own eyes. They were here.' 'In the distance, I saw a pickup truck driving toward us. It was the couple we’d come to the festival with. They saved our lives. There were around 16 of us there, lying on top of each other in the back of the pickup truck. We drove through an orchard with shots being fired behind us, and dozens of people were running into the orchard. I clearly remember seeing a girl standing outside the truck signaling us to help her, and we just couldn’t. The gunfire wasn’t letting up and we knew that if we were to stop now, that would be the end for everyone in the truck. To this day, I don’t know what happened to her. I eat myself away inside over this. It will be with me forever.' 'We got to the police station in Netivot where we stayed until nightfall. On our way home, I texted my officer and told her I was on my way back and that I needed to be in the army right now. Throughout my two months of reserve duty, I didn’t understand what I’d been through. I remember my first panic attack after reserve duty: I was in a traffic jam on my way back from Tel Aviv with two friends when my whole body started shaking. 'My heart was pounding. I thought about how this was how it started last time around, and that the massacre was happening again. It was very hard. I then started having nightmares about terrorists, and images started resurfacing along with survivor guilt. What could I have done differently? I realized I needed to start taking care of myself.' 'Yes, it’s been hard, but I’ve started dancing again. Every time I take to the dancefloor, I’m overcome by a range of emotions: Joy that I’m here, along with the pain for those who aren't. I get triggers at every rave. Each and every party means dealing with it again. By we won’t stop dancing. If we stop dancing, they'll have won. They’ve beaten us in so many ways and this isn’t going to be one of them.'

One bomb, one building: Inside IDF’s high-impact strategy in Beir...	After rocket fire targeting northern Israel, IDF strikes terror sites in Tyre and Lebanese capital's Dahieh where building seen leveled with single bomb; Israeli forces uncover Hezbollah weapons cache in southern Lebanon mosque Another day of intense fighting in northern Israel unfolded as rockets were fired from Lebanon, and the IDF responded with airstrikes on multiple targets, including villages along the border and sites in Beirut's Shia-majority Dahieh district and Tyre. The military reported that a building in Dahieh, a Hezbollah stronghold, was demolished using a single precision bomb after intelligence confirmed it housed terrorist infrastructure. Overnight, Israeli Air Force jets, guided by military intelligence, targeted weapons production and storage sites, as well as Hezbollah command centers hidden within civilian buildings in Dahieh. Following an IDF warning of imminent strikes in Tyre, Lebanese civil defense teams evacuated an entire neighborhood. Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Akhbar reported that Lebanese authorities closed roads leading to the city after receiving Israel’s warning. Reports later confirmed a drone strike in central Tyre, and additional targets were hit throughout southern Lebanon, including in the villages of Khiam, Wadi Barghaz, Taybeh, Siriane, Qasmiyeh, Qana, Baflay and Al-Jbour. On Tuesday, the IDF destroyed a building in Dahieh believed to contain Hezbollah terror infrastructure on all floors. Footage of the operation showed the building collapsing with no damage to neighboring structures or harm to bystanders. The strike was carried out using a single JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition) bomb, following recent improvements made by the Air Force's performance analysis unit to optimize munitions use. As military operations against Hezbollah continue, the IDF appears to be adopting a scaled-down version of the 'Dahieh Doctrine' from the 2006 Lebanon War, using disproportionate air and artillery firepower against civilian infrastructure utilized by terrorist organizations. Meanwhile, IDF Arabic spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee posted on social media details about the alleged location of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's bunker beneath Al-Sahel Hospital, which the military claimed housed over $500 million. 'For Lebanese journalists struggling to find Nasrallah's hideout, the entrance is in the eastern of the two buildings north of the hospital, where half a billion dollars is reportedly stored,' Adraee said, claiming Hezbollah has been blocking access to conceal the money. Simultaneously, IDF ground forces continued operations in southern Lebanon. The 205th 'Iron Fist' Reserve Brigade reported destroying dozens of tunnels and other terror sites, eliminating dozens of terrorists and seizing large quantities of weapons. During their mission, soldiers uncovered a weapons cache hidden in a mosque in a civilian neighborhood, containing grenade launchers, shoulder-fired missiles, RPGs, Kornet missiles and combat vests. All weapons were confiscated and destroyed.

Israel issues urgent travel warning for Sri Lanka amid terror thr...	National Security Council instructs Israelis to leave Arugam Bay area and other coastal regions or return home due to 'credible alert about terrorist cell already in motion' The National Security Council (NSC) issued an urgent travel advisory on Wednesday, urging Israeli nationals in Sri Lanka to immediately leave the Arugam Bay area and coastal regions in the south and west of the island. The warning follows incoming intelligence regarding a potential terrorist threat targeting tourist areas and beaches. In recent days, the NSC received intelligence about plans for an attack specifically aimed at Israelis, with Arugam Bay being a primary focus. According to officials, there is a 'credible alert about a terrorist cell already in motion.' This is reminiscent of similar threats against Israelis in Turkey in the summer of 2022, officials added. 'There may be more than one cell involved,' said a senior security official. 'We are dealing with an immediate threat, and the highest level of alert has been raised in the beach and tourist areas. There is ongoing intelligence and counterterrorism activity, with local authorities cooperating fully. Until the situation is neutralized, this remains a very hot issue.' The Mossad is leading the operation, warning of an 'escalating level of threats and intent to attack Israelis worldwide' since the outbreak of the war in October last year. The scope of the threats has required a vast global deployment of Mossad operatives. Sri Lankan police have acknowledged the risk to Israelis in the region, setting up roadblocks and conducting vehicle checks. The U.S. Embassy in Sri Lanka also issued a travel advisory, citing 'credible information about an imminent attack targeting popular tourist areas in Arugam Bay.' Security officials estimate there are hundreds of Israelis currently on the island. 'We are not calling for an immediate airlift,' the senior official added. 'We are trying to reduce the threat by advising those on the beaches to relocate to Colombo or other cities, depending on availability, and to avoid staying near the beaches. Those who can book flights and conclude their vacations are encouraged to do so, but there is no airlift planned at the moment.' The NSC has called for Israelis to leave the Arugam Bay area and beaches in the south and west of Sri Lanka, including in Ahangama, Galle, Hikkaduwa and Weligama, immediately. The threat level has been raised to level 4 in these regions. 'Those leaving these areas should either exit the country or at least relocate to Colombo, where there is a stronger security presence,' the advisory said. In the rest of Sri Lanka, the threat level has been raised to level 3, with Israelis advised to postpone non-essential travel to the country. The NSC also urged Israelis in Sri Lanka to take precautions: avoid displaying Israeli identity markers in public, including wearing shirts with Hebrew or any symbols revealing nationality and religion, and to avoid gatherings of Israelis in unsecured public areas. In the event of suspicious activity, they are advised to contact local security forces.

North Gaza polio campaign postponed due to violence, says WHO	A polio vaccination campaign in north Gaza has been postponed due to Israeli bombardments, mass displacement and lack of access, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. This final phase, that was due to begin on Wednesday, aimed to vaccinate more than 119,000 children in the Palestinian enclave under siege for over a year in response to militant group Hamas' attacks on Israel. 'The current conditions, including ongoing attacks on civilian infrastructure, continue to jeopardize people's safety and movement in northern Gaza, making it impossible for families to safely bring their children for vaccination, and health workers to operate,' the U.N. agency said in a statement, reiterating its call for a cease-fire. The polio campaign began on Sept. 1 after the WHO confirmed in August that a baby was partially paralyzed by the type 2 polio virus, the first such case in the territory in 25 years. Delays in a second dose for children could jeopardise efforts to halt transmission.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1oqe8iljl	2024-10-23T03:49:56-07:00

Time stood still': Gaza hostages' last holiday at home	Idan saw his mother, who flew in from US, before being abducted on Simchat Torah; Chaim shared his Yom Kippur War story day before massacre; Guy promised to help dismantle sukkah after Nova festival; hostage families recount final moments with loved ones before being taken to Gaza A year ago, on the eve of Simchat Torah, 101 Israelis were spending time with their families and friends. The following morning, their lives were upended—they became the 101 hostages whose return the entire nation still longs for. Families of eight of the hostages shared with Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth the last moments they remember with their loved ones before the nightmare began. Idan Alexander One of the hostages is Idan Alexander, 20. His mother, Yael, flew in from the United States to visit him during Sukkot. 'When the kids were younger, we used to build a sukkah in the U.S.,' she recalled. 'Now that they’re older, we usually visit friends during the holiday.' At 18, Idan made the decision to move to Israel and enlist in the Golani Brigade. He had been home for Rosh Hashanah and part of Sukkot last year, but spent Yom Kippur on base, where he chose to fast despite being on guard duty. 'I arrived in Israel on the Saturday before the abduction, and Idan came to pick me up,' Yael recounted. 'On Sunday and Monday, we were at my parents’ sukkah in Tel Aviv. My mother invited the extended family, and she always hosts a big Bukharan meal in the sukkah on the roof. But Idan insisted on taking me to get the best burger in town, even though I told him we had a huge meal coming up in a few hours. He devoured that burger. 'On Tuesday morning, he left for the base. I was supposed to fly back to the U.S. on October 7, and he knew that. We talked about it on October 6. Of course, everything was canceled.' Idan was abducted from his base and taken to Gaza. He had managed to tell his mother that he’d been hit by shrapnel in his helmet but was safe and in a secure location. During his time in captivity, his family received several signs of life from him. Itay Chen The last full family gathering for the Chen family took place during Rosh Hashanah. Nineteen-year-old Itay Chen, a tank crew member, didn’t come home for Sukkot. Instead, he returned to his battalion's mission along the Gaza border, tasked with securing the area during the holiday. On the morning of October 7, Itay and his fellow tank crew fought to fend off waves of terrorists heading toward Israeli communities near Gaza. Itay was killed in the battle, and his body was taken by the terrorists. Since then, his family has had no peace, as time seems to have stood still. 'Our family has no holidays,' said his father, Ruby. 'Every holiday, we have an empty chair, and it’s unbearable. The last time we were a complete family was in that Rosh Hashanah photo, and since then, we haven’t been able to come together physically because we don’t have a grave for Itay. He’s still in Gaza, and we can’t find closure.' Liri Albag Liri Albag, 19, had just begun her service as a proud lookout soldier at the Nahal Oz base when she was home for the start of Sukkot. Though disappointed to be stationed on base for the second holiday, she resolved to make the most of it. On the morning of October 7, as rocket sirens blared, Liri managed to send a photo to her boyfriend from the shelter and briefly speak with her family. Shortly after, she and six other female soldiers were abducted from the Nahal Oz post. One, Ori Magidish, has since been rescued, and another, Noa Marciano, was killed in captivity, with her body later recovered. Liri remains in captivity, along with four others: Daniella Gilboa, Karina Ariev, Agam Berger and Naama Levy. Tal Chaimi In a Sukkot holiday photo, Tal Chaimi, 41, stands alongside his brother-in-law, Rani Oren Goldin, and their children in a sukkah at the home of Tal’s sister, Or, in Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak. 'We always had a family sukkah,' said Or. 'Tal stored the wood and netting for it, and every holiday we’d pull it out, pick a spot and set it up. We’d have meals and family gatherings, sometimes even sleep in it.' Before they could take down the sukkah, both Tal and Oren, members of the kibbutz’s emergency response team, were killed or abducted while defending its borders on October 7. Goldin’s body was recovered and buried in Israel in July, but Tal remains in Gaza. Seven months after the attack, Tal’s wife, Ella, gave birth to their fourth child, Lotan. Chaim Peri On the eve of Simchat Torah, the extended Peri family gathered at the home of their patriarch and matriarch, Chaim, 80, and Osnat, in Kibbutz Nir Oz. The family reunion came as Israel marked 50 years since the Yom Kippur War, where Chaim had fought in the Sinai. Chaim proudly shared his wartime memories with the entire family, presenting a well-prepared slideshow recounting his experiences. 'We were all sitting in the living room, and I couldn’t believe all the grandkids were paying attention with us,' said Chaim’s daughter, Ofri Peri. She recalled her five-and-a-half-year-old daughter asking, 'What would have happened to our people if the army hadn’t won?' Her sister Reut responded, 'That’s impossible—our army is the strongest in the world, and it always wins.' Ofri reflected, 'The next morning, I thought about how my daughter went to bed with those words. In hindsight, she asked very profound questions.' The following day, on October 7, Chaim was abducted from his home and taken to Gaza. He survived months in captivity before the IDF announced his death in June. In August, his body was recovered and returned to Israel for burial. 'There are still 101 hostages in Gaza with whom we have had no communication for over a year,' Ofri said, reflecting on the loss of her father and the ongoing uncertainty for many families. Guy Gilboa-Dalal Last Sukkot, Guy Gilboa-Dalal, 23, wasn’t able to help his father, Ilan, build their family’s sukkah as he did every year. Throughout the holiday, the family hosted friends and relatives in the sukkah each evening. Before leaving for the Nova music festival on October 6, Guy promised his father that he would help dismantle the sukkah upon his return. Tragically, Guy was abducted from the Nova festival alongside his friend Evyatar David. His older brother, Gal, managed to escape the attack, but two of his close friends, Ron Tzarfati and Idan Harmati, were killed. Omer Shem Tov On Friday, October 6, the family of Omer Shem Tov, 21, celebrated the birthday of his mother, Shelly. The family spent the holiday evening with friends in Even Yehuda. 'We had such a great day,' said Omer’s father, Malki. 'We were in Jerusalem in the morning and stopped for burgers in Tel Aviv on the way back after Omer convinced us. It was a holiday evening full of laughter. We got home around midnight, and then Omer went out.' Later that night, Omer attended the Nova music festival, where he met up with Itay and Maya Regev. The three were abducted together. Itay and Maya were returned in a deal nearly a year ago, but Omer remains in captivity. 'Holidays are a breaking point for us, as are Friday night dinners,' said Malki. 'There’s no motivation to celebrate anything. Omer asked us not to worry, but I hope he knows we’re moving heaven and earth for him. He’s not alone, and we’ll do everything to bring him back.' Tamir Adar For the past decade, Tamir Adar, 38, spent Rosh Hashanah with his wife’s family at the Sea of Galilee, and the second night of the holiday was always reserved for his mother, Yael. 'It was also my birthday, and everyone came—the kids, the grandkids, my father. No one was missing. It was the last time we were all togetherr like that,' Yael recalled. 'We had a barbecue, which Tamir loved to do. He even taught his son how to handle it all,' she added. 'A year has passed, and now 8-year-old Assaf proudly takes over the barbecue, just like his father taught him. I last saw Tamir on October 6. We chatted for a few minutes and planned to meet the next day, but we never did. Since then, another Rosh Hashanah has come and gone, and I turned 60, but we didn’t celebrate anything. Nothing feels festive, my throat tightens. We sit at the table mainly for the kids—they are our strength.' Tamir was wounded and abducted from Nir Oz and died from his injuries in Gaza on October 7. His grandmother, Yaffa Adar, was also abducted that day but was released in a hostage exchange in November.

All the weapons that were found were seized and dismantled. In recent days, the brigade's troops have located and dismantled dozens of tunnel shafts and terrorist infrastructure, eliminated dozens of terrorists, and located large quantities of weapons, according to the IDF.

Steak, sushi and pizza: IDF steps up its food game for front line...	Culinary innovations meet military logistics as IDF troops in southern Lebanon enjoy gourmet meals like pulled asado and entrecôte steaks, boosting morale with upgraded, diverse and carefully prepared food options, far surpassing traditional combat rations As IDF soldiers engage in battles in southern Lebanon, their culinary experience has seen a significant upgrade. Commando Brigade fighters, along with paratroopers and tank crews, are now receiving far better meals than those provided in the past. Instead of the traditional rations of canned corn and tuna, soldiers were treated to pulled asado and entrecôte steaks from a smoker set up in the Galilee during the High Holy Days. 'Those fighting in Lebanese territory received these delicacies in special trays, with carefully prepared side dishes. Troops on the front lines enjoyed these gourmet meals packed in baguettes,' said logistics officers from the 98th Division’s elite Commando Brigade. Their philosophy is simple: every ammunition shipment should also include quality food for the troops, especially after the lessons learned from operations in Gaza. Combat rations have also been upgraded, now featuring protein bars, beef jerky and vacuum-sealed meat dishes in various sauces that can be heated in the field. Over the holidays, soldiers in enemy territory even received festive treats, including dates, pomegranates and olives. The experience of creating a supply network under the more difficult conditions of Gaza has been crucial. 'In Gaza, we reached a point where we had ice cream freezers powered by generators, pizzerias for the troops, mobile sushi bars, shawarma stations and more,' the logistics officers recounted. 'There’s no reason why soldiers in Lebanon shouldn’t enjoy good food as well. Our rule is that no soldier should receive the same meal two days in a row. We hold daily brainstorming sessions, learn from our experiences and constantly seek new ways to improve, paying attention to every detail.' Recently, the IDF has begun testing airborne supply drops in the northern sector, causing some alarm in the Upper Galilee earlier this month. However, the supply drops were primarily an operational test, similar to the equipment drops in Gaza earlier this year, and aimed at ensuring readiness for potential ground operations deep in Lebanon. Additionally, Commando Brigade troops have used special robots to transport food and equipment in recent weeks, minimizing risk to soldiers. These machines have successfully navigated Lebanon’s rugged terrain, though troops are also prepared for 'logistical independence,' remaining far from supply lines if necessary. While operations along the northern border are expected to conclude within weeks, soldiers have been fully equipped with winter gear, including thermal shirts and storm suits, as temperatures in the region continue to drop. Another logistical development has been the establishment of military police stations along the border to handle the large amounts of weapons seized from Hezbollah, ensuring proper evaluation before they are investigated or destroyed.

Indictment: Iran-linked cell planned to kill Israeli nuclear scie...	7 East Jerusalem men, arrested last month for allegedly carrying out missions for payment, charged with attempting to assassinate nuclear scientist, directed by Iranian agent; one suspect purchased weapon but arrested before completing plot The Jerusalem District Court filed an indictment on Wednesday against seven young men, aged 19 to 23, from the Beit Safafa neighborhood in East Jerusalem, for serious security offenses, including aiding the enemy during wartime and providing intelligence to an enemy. The charges come after the group, allegedly directed by Iranian operatives, plotted to assassinate an Israeli nuclear scientist and his family. According to the indictment, the cell planned to murder the scientist, burn down his home, and had attempted to enter the Weizmann Institute of Science, a prestigious research university in Rehovot, where the scientist worked and lived. After being denied entry, two of the suspects photographed the entrance to the institute and later surveilled the scientist's home. The seven suspects—Rami Alyan, Abd al-Rahman Alyan, Muhammad Khatib, Mamdouh Khader, Omri Abu Hamida, Mahmoud Khader and Muhammad Taha—face multiple charges, including aiding the enemy during wartime, contact with a foreign agent, conspiracy to commit a terrorist act and arson. A joint investigation by the Shin Bet and the Jerusalem Police's Central Unit uncovered an Iranian intelligence network working to recruit and activate Israeli citizens for missions within Israel. The lead suspect, Rami Alyan, reportedly acted under the direction of an Iranian agent via the instant messaging app Telegram and recruited the other suspects to assist with various tasks. The group also attempted to procure firearms and explosives for the assassination. The group allegedly received payments for their activities, ranging from 500 shekels ($130) for photographing locations such as the Weizmann Institute, 1,500 shekels ($390) for surveillance of specific targets and 2,000 shekels ($520) for setting a vehicle on fire. They were also paid between 13,000 and 15,000 shekels ($3,380-$3,900) to procure weapons, including a handgun and potentially a Carlo submachine gun, though the transaction was not completed. The suspects were paid in cryptocurrency, which was later converted into approximately 26,000 shekels ($6,760) in cash. The arrests, which occurred last month in a central Israeli city, were made after an urgent tip-off to Shin Bet’s elite Tequila rapid intervention unit and the Israel Police's Yamam counterterrorism team, following long-term intelligence monitoring. Authorities acted quickly after receiving intelligence that the cell was on the verge of carrying out an assassination. In addition to the plot targeting the scientist, the suspects also allegedly planned to assassinate a central Israeli mayor and carried out other activities, including setting vehicles on fire in Jerusalem's Ein Kerem neighborhood, spraying anti-Israel graffiti, attempting to acquire weapons such as guns and grenades, and planning attacks on security forces. After some cell members were arrested, Alyan fled, destroyed his operational phone and discarded the pieces in an open field to avoid detection. Police searches of the suspects' homes uncovered 50,000 shekels ($13,000), a forged police license plate and numerous credit cards. This case is the fifth recent instance of Israeli citizens being exposed as operatives working for Iranian interests. Earlier this week, it was revealed that seven Israelis from northern Israel, originally from Azerbaijan, were arrested for spying on military bases on behalf of Iran, with plans to assassinate a senior Israeli official and his son. Israel has noted an increase in Iran’s efforts to recruit Israelis to gather intelligence, though these plots have not yet resulted in a major operational success. Iranian activity has shifted focus from targeting high-ranking officials to scientists and academics, posing an ongoing challenge for Israeli counterintelligence. A senior Border Police official emphasized the urgency of the operation, stating that the cell had reached an advanced stage of planning the assassination. Experts warn that while Israeli efforts have successfully thwarted these plots, Iran’s attempts should not be dismissed. 'It's like a goalkeeper during penalty shots—you’re bound to block many, but eventually, one will get through,' said one source. The Shin Bet’s counter-espionage division has increased its operations over the past two years, with financial gain emerging as a common motivation for the Israeli recruits, most of whom were aware they were working for Iran.

IDF confirms Nasrallah's designated successor dead	Hashem Safieddine targeted in IDF strike earlier this month found dead with 25 others from Hezbollah's intelligence HQ, in the ruins of a bunker in the Dahieh, three weeks after the attack The IDF confirmed late on Tuesday that senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine was killed in a targeted strike early in October after reports that his body was found in the destroyed Hezbollah bunker three weeks after the attack. The IDF confirmation came after a report in Saudi Arabia's Al Hadath channel claiming the Safieddine's body was identified. 'The IDF can now confirm that Hashem Safieddine, Head of the Hezbollah Executive Council, and Ali Hussein Hazima, Commander of Hezbollah's Intelligence Headquarters, were eliminated by the IDF, along with additional Hezbollah commanders. The terrorists were eliminated in a strike carried out approximately three weeks ago in the area of Dahieh, a key Hezbollah terrorist stronghold in Beirut,' the military said in a statement. Safieddine, Nasrallah's cousin was considered to be his successor as Hezbollah's leader. 'Due to his familial and personal ties with Nasrallah, he had a significant influence on decision-making within the terrorist organization. During times when Nasrallah was absent from Lebanon, Safieddine filled in as the Secretary-General,' the IDF said. 'Throughout the years, he directed terrorist attacks against the State of Israel and took part in Hezbollah's central decision-making processes.' The Al Arabiya network in Saudi Arabia said his body was found along with 23 others, who according to the IDF were members of the terror group's intelligence command including Bilal Saib Aish, who was in charge of aerial intelligence gathering in Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters in Syria and Ali Hussein Hazima, the Commander of Hezbollah's Intelligence Headquarters. Safieddine, on the U.S. terror list since 2017, has managed Hezbollah’s education system, finances and foreign investments, leaving military and strategic matters to Nasrallah. He has maintained close ties with Tehran and supports the Iranian regime, with his brother Abdullah serving as Hezbollah’s envoy to Iran. Born in 1964 in a village near the southern city of Tyre, Safieddine hails from a prominent family of clerics. Throughout the current war, he has represented Nasrallah at public events, including the funerals of senior Hezbollah members killed in what was believed to be an Israeli attack. 'The wounded will return to their Jihad,' Safieddine said at a recent event, adding, 'If the enemy's goal is to halt support for Gaza, it must know that it will only grow.'

Pentagon denies senior staffer investigated for document leak	Press secretary says Ariane Tabatabai is 'not a subject of interest' in the ongoing investigation into how classified documents on Israel's planned attack on Iran, appeared online; says Pentagon is in contact with Israel regarding details of the investigation Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder on Tuesday denied the reports that Ariane Tabatabai, a Senior staffer at the Pentagon, of Iranian origin was suspected of being behind the leak of Israeli plans to strike Iran. Earlier Sky News Arabic named Tabatabai A senior staffer in the office of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was as the person who leaked the documents, quoting a senior Pentagon Source. Fox News reported from their sources that the report is false and that the staffer was at work and retains her security clearance. Ryder said the Pentagon was in contact with Israel regarding details of the investigation. 'it is important to let the investigation run its course,' Ryder said in a briefing. 'To my knowledge, this official is not a subject of interest and the department remains fully committed to supporting the investigation.' Fox News reported from their sources that the report is false and that the staffer was at work and retains her security clearance. The Washington Post on Tuesday said the FBI was investigating the leak of the two highly classified intelligence documents. 'The FBI is investigating the alleged leak of classified documents and working closely with our partners in the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community,' the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement cited by the Post. An investigation into the leak of the documents that appeared on a telegram channel was launched and the incident made headlines in major news outlets. Officials in Washington expressed their deep concern over the leak. The documents are attributed to the U.S. Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency (GNA) and note that Israel continues to move military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran's ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. They were sharable within the 'Five Eyes,' which are the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The documents do not contain details or an overall picture of the targets of the attack, but rather general preparations for a long-range attack by the Air Force, which the intelligence professionals and the Revolutionary Guards Air Force could have assessed for themselves using the basic intelligence they already have. One of the documents states that, according to the analysis of various images, the Air Force conducted exercises with air-launched ballistic missiles (ALBM), including at least 16 'Golden Horizon' missiles and 40 'Rocks' or ISO2 missiles. The documents also discuss 'covert drone activity' and extensive deployment drills. It also reports on 'secret UAV activity,' and claims that the Air Force conducted a 'second large-scale deployment exercise' between October 15 and 16. The report also states that, during those days, activity related to air-to-surface missiles (ASM) was observed at the Ramat David and Ramon Air Force Bases. Another leaked document, which allegedly contains an analysis by the NGA, reports that the IDF 'probably' also conducted an aerial refueling exercise on October 16, and contained a side note stating Israel's apparent ability to use UAVs in order to gather intelligence in Iran and 'across the region.' Israeli officials said the leak was an embarrassment for the Pentagon just one year after dozens of classified documents about the Russian war on Ukraine, were leaked by a U.S. Air Force IT technician. The leak shows how closely the Americans are watching Israel, despite the close alliance between the two nations and its revelation was the source of some discomfort and damage to the credibility of the American security and intelligence agencies. Israeli officials said they expected the leaker to be found and prosecuted so that such events do not occur but added that the leak would not prompt Israelis to hide information from their American counterparts although, it may increase some mistrust already felt against Washington.

Far-right lawmaker threatens to block PA from high court	Religious Zionism's Simcha Rothman introduces a bill to curb Palestinian rights to appeal to Israel's Supreme Court: 'Correct a distortion in which hostile elements have rights in court' The Knesset's Constitution, Law, and Justice Committee is expected to approve a bill proposed by its chairman, Simcha Rothman's that would deny the Palestinian Authority's (PA)right of standing in the Israeli Supreme Court.

'The purpose of the bill is to correct a distortion in which hostile elements to the State of Israel, including those who work directly to harm its citizens through acts of terrorism, are considered to have the right of standing before the Supreme Court when they come to petition against the policies of the Israeli government,' Rothman wrote in his explanation of the proposed bill. He added that the PA was currently seeking the court's ruling on proposed legislation that would allow Israel to pay compensation to victims of terror or their families, from taxes collected by Israel for the PA. Rothman claimed that the Supreme Court cannot serve the PA while it pays salaries to terrorists. His claim is that the PA, which pays stipends to the families of terrorists who were killed or were serving Prison terms for their attacks, can not seek the protection of Israeli court. Rothman was also promoting legislation to begin prosecuting Nukhba members who participated in the Hamas atrocities on October 7 last year, while the government delayed such prosecution to avoid complicating negotiations on a hostage release deal The committee chair wants to establish a special court that will deal with extraordinary crimes such as genocide which the massacre would be considered. Rothman was one of the architects of the current coalition's legislative push to alter the judicial system in Israel and weaken the standing of its courts. That prompted mass protests in the year leading up to the October massacre and was seen by some as a reflection of Israel's weakness that encouraged Hamas to attack.

Israel considers its response to the surge in Iran spies	Following Iran's attempts to assassinate Israeli scientists and mayors through proxies, Shin Bet official warns Israelis their citizenship may be revoked if they agree to work for the enemy Israeli security agencies were considering how to deal with the surge of spies working for Iran. A senior official in the Shin Bet said that there is a systematic Iranian effort to target senior Israelis. On Tuesday, a new cell of operatives working for Iran, this time in East Jerusalem, was uncovered. They are suspected of planning the assassination of a nuclear scientist and the mayor of a city in central Israel. On Monday, the Shin Bet said it arrested seven others, all members of a family who immigrated from Azerbaijan. According to the police, they had been carrying out missions for Iran for two years, before they were captured. 'According to the information gathered in the defense establishment, scientists, mayors, defense establishment senior officials, and other Israeli officials were the targets of Iranian operatives,' the Shin Bet official said. 'The key to dealing with this is, first of all, a severe punishment that will deter collaborators. People will understand that this is treason, a violation of state security, serving the enemy during wartime.' He said law enforcement and the prosecution should consider financial penalties such as the freezing of assets in addition to denial of citizenship. A number of Israelis were arrested after they agreed to carry out missions on behalf of Iranian intelligence operatives in recent months. The security officials said security services were aware and had increased their efforts to uncover such plots. 'Public awareness on the subject can help people understand more, suspect more and be more vigilant when contacted over social media,' he said. warning people not to click on unknown links, not to engage with suspicious strangers, and to avoid answering unknown emails. Meanwhile, the mayor who was targeted for assassination was notified of the threat against him. 'Threats are not new to us, even from criminal elements. I, as mayor, do not shy away from it. There have been mayors who have bolstered the security around themselves, and that is how I will continue to act. I have dedicated my life to the public from a very young age, nothing deters me, I am focused purely on promoting the city and caring for every resident,' he said. The arrest of the east Jerusalem cell, made up of men between the ages of 19 and 23, led interrogators to Iranian intelligence agents who were recruiting Israelis to carry out missions. One of the detainees, a 23-year-old Israeli citizen, was suspected of contacting a foreign agent and recruited to perform various tasks in Israel. The investigation revealed that the suspect recruited the other members of the cell to carry out the missions they received from the Iranian regime. Those involved sprayed graffiti in various places throughout the country, setting vehicles on fire in ​​Jerusalem, and gathering intelligence. 'For every reported arrest, there are 10 more' According to a source in the police, for every arrest of operatives working for Iran, there are 10 more cases being investigated. He said the police often stop the suspects before they carry out Iranian instructions that they would never be able to walk back from. But revealing the spy ring of Israelis working for Iran for years, sending photos of military bases and pinpointing sensitive sites, was an eye opener and a clear sign of escalation. The suspects told their interrogators that their motive for working for Iran was financial. Some had been in debt and the Iranians were willing to pay them well. They also said that although they loved the people in Israel, they did not feel like they belong.

The two men met for 2.5 hours before the secretary met with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said Netanyahu told Blinken that there was a need for a security and political change in Lebanon that would allow displaced Israelis to return safely to their homes. 'The meeting was friendly and productive,' the PMO said. According to Netanyahu's office the men discussed the threat from Iran and the need of Israel and the United States to unite forces to confront it. the PMO also said that Blinken 'expressed the US's deep shock over the Iranian attempt, via Hezbollah, to eliminate the Prime Minister of Israel, and made it clear that this was an exceptionally extreme incident.' Families of hostages demonstrated outside Blinken's Tel Aviv hotel in the evening hours blocking roads and calling for the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza for over a year, to be released. Blinken began his meetings in Israel as Hezbollah launched rockets into Tel Aviv and Haifa and Israeli air strikes targeted parts of Beirut's southern suburbs, including an air strike that caused a multi-story building to entirely collapse and sent a fresh wave of panicked residents fleeing. This was the secretary's 11th trip to the region since the Hamas massacre last October 7 and the start of the ensuing war. Washington hopes the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar - Israel's most wanted man, blamed for triggering the year of warfare by planning the deadly attack on Oct. 7 last year on Israeli territory - will provide a new opportunity for peace. But Israel has so far shown no sign of relenting in its military campaigns even after assassinating several leaders of Iran's allies Hamas and Hezbollah, which lost its powerful secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah in a Sept. 27 airstrike. Blinken was meeting Netanyahu and other officials at the start of a week-long trip that will also take him to Jordan and Qatar. U.S. officials say he is exploring plans for rebuilding and governing Gaza after the war, key to reaching a ceasefire. Iran and its allies - Lebanon's Hezbollah, Yemen's Houthis, armed groups in Iraq and Hamas in Gaza - have said that their 'Axis of Resistance' against Israeli and U.S. interests will emerge victorious. The Houthis said on Tuesday they had targeted an Israeli military base in Tel Aviv using ballistic missiles in solidarity with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkypiubgyx	2024-10-22T10:11:53-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/22/H111bbFfHe1l/H111bbFfHe1l_1_259_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

IDF choppers and jets are in pursuit of the hostile aircraft and the military urged the public to adhere to the guidelines of the Home Front Command; earlier a drone is shot down off the coast of Acre More than a million Israelis rushed into shelters on Tuesday afternoon when sirens warned of hostile drones targeting Israel. The sirens began in the Western Galilee city of Nahariya and continued south through the Haifa Bay area, the city of Haifa, the Jezreel Valley and onward, toward the center of the country. For 15 minutes, the fight path southward could be seen in the siren alerts that were activated. IDF planes and choppers were in pursuit of the hostile aircraft and urged the public to adhere to the guidelines of the Home Front Command and remain in shelters. The IDF said one drone was intercepted over the Mediterranean Sea off the cost of Acre. Earlier in the day, Israel officially confirmed that a drone launched from Lebanon on Saturday hit the private residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the affluent seaside community of Caesarea. Netanyahu and his wife were not at home when the drone attack occurred, and the prime minister later said he was not deterred by the attempt on his life.

Three other IDF soldiers were badly hurt in the attack when Hezbollah launched a barrage of 10 rockets at the Upper Galilee; the Iran-backed terror group launched rocket attacks at central Israel earlier, claiming to target the 8200 intelligence unit north of Tel Aviv Master Sergeant (res.) Saar Eliad Navarsky, aged 27, from Tel Aviv fell in the fighting in the north, the IDF said on Tuesday. He served in the Artillery Corps and was the fourth of its soldiers to be killed. He was killed in a Hezbollah rocket attack on the Upper Galilee. Three other soldiers were badly wounded in the attack. A barrage of 10 rockets was fired from Lebanon and fell south-east of the northern city of Kiryat Shmona causing a brushfire. Dozens of rockets targeted Israel including the center of the country since the early morning hours. the rocket attack caused damage to 20 homes in a kibbutz south of Haifa. The Iran-backed terror group which claimed responsibility for the attacks said one of their rocket barrages was aimed at the 8200 intelligence base north of Tel Aviv and another was on an Iron Dome missile defense battery.

Close call: Dramatic footage captures rocket hit near northern Is...	Lebanon rocket explodes near gas station in Kibbutz Ma'agan Michael, caught on both dashboard and security camera; no injuries were reported, with residents crediting defensive guidelines for their safety A rocket fired from Lebanon exploded near a gas station in Kibbutz Ma'agan Michael on Tuesday morning, just north of Zikhron Ya’akov. Captured on both a dashboard and security camera, the blast caused significant property damage but no physical injuries. One man suffered from shock, and the explosion damaged homes and parked cars in the area. Leah Cohen, a local whose home was hit by shrapnel, recounted, 'I was working in the garden when the alarm went off. I quickly entered the safe room, and then there was a loud boom. I'm just thankful I followed the guidelines.' Baruch Fein, another kibbutz resident, said the rocket exploded only several hundred feet from his home: 'There’s extensive damage, but thanks to the safe room, everyone is safe. It was a miracle.' Tami Engel, whose home was also damaged, echoed the sentiment: 'We entered the safe room, which saved us. You must follow the guidelines. The house is in ruins, demolished and destroyed. We're alive because we adhered to the defensive guidelines. Entering the safe room is essential; it saves lives.' Modi Bracha, head of the kibbutz’s alert squad, expressed relief: 'Fortunately, we have no casualties, just damage. The explosion was enormous. Property tax officials will come to assess the damage caused by the rocket's fall. People adhered to the guidelines, and it was truly fortunate.' Asif Izik, head of the Hof HaCarmel Regional Council, credited the outcome to adherence to safety measures. 'We woke up to a morning of alarms, but thanks to proper conduct and adherence to defensive guidelines, the incident concluded without casualties and with minor damage. Our defensive guidelines remain unchanged, and we conduct ongoing assessments with the Home Front Command.' From early Tuesday, rocket barrages launched from Lebanon hit various regions across Israel, including the West Bank. There were no reported injuries in all cases. The IDF intercepted several rockets, while others landed in unpopulated areas. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attacks, claiming that some rockets targeted the base of Unit 8200, the IDF's top cyber intelligence unit, in Glilot near Tel Aviv, and another aimed at an Iron Dome missile defense system battery in Nirit. Meanwhile, the IDF launched a series of nighttime airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Beirut, focusing on the group's naval unit. According to the military, the strikes, carried out by Israeli fighter jets, were directed by intelligence from the Navy and the military's Intelligence Directorate. The airstrikes reportedly hit weapons depots, command centers and underground infrastructure, including facilities storing equipment for maritime attacks. One key target was Hezbollah's naval base in Beirut, which is used to store high-speed vessels and train naval forces. These vessels are reportedly designed to attack Israeli naval ships and other strategic targets in Israeli waters. The IDF emphasized that these strikes were crucial in disrupting Hezbollah's ability to plan and execute maritime terror operations against Israel.

Senior Pentagon staffer leaked Israel's Iran strike plans, report	Sky News Arabic quotes a Pentagon source claiming a senior member of staff in the office of U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's aid for special operations is behind the leak A senior staffer in the office of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was identified as the leaker of the classified documents dealing with the Israeli preparations for an attack on Iran, Sky News Arabic reported on Tuesday, quoting a senior Pentagon Source. The suspected staffer is Bureau Chief Austin's aid for special operations and was authorized to have access to very secret information. A report in the Washington Post on Tuesday said the FBI was investigating the leak of the two highly classified intelligence documents. 'The FBI is investigating the alleged leak of classified documents and working closely with our partners in the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community,' the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement cited by the Post. An investigation into the leak of the documents that appeared on a telegram channel was launched and the incident made headlines in major news outlets. Officials in Washington expressed their deep concern over the leak. The documents are attributed to the U.S. Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency (GNA) and note that Israel continues to move military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran's ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. They were sharable within the 'Five Eyes,' which are the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The documents do not contain details or an overall picture of the targets of the attack, but rather general preparations for a long-range attack by the Air Force, which the intelligence professionals and the Revolutionary Guards Air Force could have assessed for themselves using the basic intelligence they already have. One of the documents states that, according to the analysis of various images, the Air Force conducted exercises with air-launched ballistic missiles (ALBM), including at least 16 'Golden Horizon' missiles and 40 'Rocks' or ISO2 missiles. The documents also discuss 'covert drone activity' and extensive deployment drills. It also reports on 'secret UAV activity,' and claims that the Air Force conducted a 'second large-scale deployment exercise' between October 15 and 16. The report also states that, during those days, activity related to air-to-surface missiles (ASM) was observed at the Ramat David and Ramon Air Force Bases. Another leaked document, which allegedly contains an analysis by the NGA, reports that the IDF 'probably' also conducted an aerial refueling exercise on October 16, and contained a side note stating Israel's apparent ability to use UAVs in order to gather intelligence in Iran and 'across the region.' Israeli officials said the leak was an embarrassment for the Pentagon just one year after dozens of classified documents about the Russian war on Ukraine, were leaked by a U.S. Air Force IT technician. The leak shows how closely the Americans are watching Israel, despite the close alliance between the two nations and its revelation was the source of some discomfort and damage to the credibility of the American security and intelligence agencies. Israeli officials said they expected the leaker to be found and prosecuted so that such events do not occur but added that the leak would not prompt Israelis to hide information from their American counterparts although, it may increase some mistrust already felt against Washington.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjmfxergjx	2024-10-22T07:27:02-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/19/ryDaczZlyx/ryDaczZlyx_0_0_854_479_0_small.jpg
UAE emerges as key diplomatic player in Russia-Ukraine conflict, ...	Growing strategic ties between Moscow and Abu Dhabi hold significant implications, especially with Middle East embroiled in conflict, particularly involving Israel in Gaza and southern Lebanon On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, hailing the 'strategic partnership' between their countries and expressing gratitude for the UAE’s role in mediating prisoner exchanges in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The two leaders discussed the ongoing war in Ukraine as well as escalating violence in the Middle East. Formal talks continued on Monday. Putin specifically praised the UAE for its efforts in facilitating multiple prisoner exchanges between Russia and Ukraine, the most recent of which occurred last Friday, with each side repatriating 95 prisoners. The UAE confirmed that this marked its ninth successful mediation in such exchanges since the war began, reflecting the Gulf nation's increasingly prominent diplomatic role. The growing strategic ties between Russia and the UAE hold significant implications for the region, especially with the Middle East embroiled in conflict, particularly involving Israel in Gaza and southern Lebanon. What does this growing partnership mean, and why has the UAE emerged as a key mediator in international conflicts? Experts shared the following insights with The Media Line: According to Dr. Nikolai Topornin, a Russian expert in international relations and geopolitics, there is no single factor driving the relationship between the two countries. 'For Russia, the UAE has become a very important outpost in the Middle East. But above all, since 2022, since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Dubai has turned into a financial capital for Russia’s international settlements,' he noted. 'We know that many financial sanctions were introduced, restrictions on the use of SWIFT, on the use of dollars and euros in settlements. As a result, Dubai became a financial lifeline for Russia. For a time, all settlements with third countries, especially those involving dollars or euros, went through Dubai,' Topornin shared. Although secondary U.S. sanctions have complicated these transactions, Topornin explained that 'Russia and the Emirates now settle either in dirhams or rubles, so financial channels continue to exist.' Dr. Nikolay Kozhanov, research associate professor at Qatar University’s Gulf Studies Center, emphasized that the term 'partnership' might not be the most accurate to describe the two countries’ ties; instead, he suggested 'pragmatic interaction.' He said that the UAE’s relationship with Russia is part of the country’s broader strategy to diversify its foreign policy. 'It’s just more falling in the attempt of the Emirates to diversify its foreign policies, to make it more reliant on different players, and to gain more profit from this diversity of international contacts. Definitely, Russia turned to Asia as a result of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, which provided the Emirates with a certain profit.' Kozhanov pointed to the UAE's role in helping Russia circumvent international sanctions: 'The Emirates is a kind of a springboard for Russian petrochemicals and oil to Asia and Africa. It’s definitely a source of a loophole in the sanctions regime against Russia, and by serving as a kind of a way for parallel imports to Russia, the UAE is getting additional profit.' Topornin also underscored the significance of the oil market in shaping the two countries’ relationship. 'The UAE and Saudi Arabia are key oil producers in the Middle East, forming the world oil market, and Russia is part of OPEC+. For Russia, stability in the oil market is crucial because much of the country’s budget depends on oil and gas revenues,' he explained. 'It’s vital for Russia to have stability to understand what future income they can expect, so avoiding any crisis scenarios in oil prices is a top priority,' Topornin emphasized. Despite this pragmatic interaction, Kozhanov noted that it does not mean the two nations are building an unbreakable alliance. 'There is a clear understanding in the Emirates that this interaction is not an attempt to build up a kind of ironclad block. It’s just a very pragmatic approach to use those opportunities that are provided by the international situation,' he said. 'In the region, for instance, we definitely see them cooperating in Libya, but at the same time, they have quite different views on Sudan. Russia supports the official government, while the UAE is supporting the opposing force. Their interests, despite cooperation, are not 100% overlapping,' Kozhanov added. Addressing the UAE’s surprising role in mediating prisoner exchanges between Russia and Ukraine, Topornin remarked: 'Who would have thought that the UAE would play such a role? European intermediaries, Chinese or Indian mediators, and even countries like Britain and Brazil haven’t managed to achieve much in practical terms here. But the UAE, alongside Saudi Arabia, has filled this important mediating function.' Topornin also hinted at rumors of discreet meetings between Russian and Ukrainian representatives in Dubai: 'We can’t say these are regular or formal, but we understand that even prisoner exchanges require some form of interaction. So, it’s likely that in Dubai, behind closed doors, such contacts are taking place.' According to Kozhanov, it’s clear that such mediation efforts serve to enhance the UAE’s global standing. 'It’s more to show on the international arena the political weight of the Emirates themselves. It’s not about helping Russia or helping Ukraine,' he said. 'It should also be considered within the framework of a greater competition between the UAE and Saudi Arabia. While the Saudis are holding this peace conference, the UAE is trying to compete with them by playing the role of the mediator,' Kozhanov added. Kozhanov also mentioned that Russia’s military ties with Iran, while important, have not shifted the balance of power in the region. 'We don’t see any serious supplies of sophisticated weapons coming from Russia due to the war, and I don’t think we’ll see them anytime soon,' he said. 'The Gulf countries, including the UAE, are trying to navigate very carefully. On the one hand, they need to pay attention to the demands of their own populations, which are no doubt supporting Palestine and the Palestinians. But on the other hand, they are extremely pragmatic, and they are trying to stick to their interests that are naturally bringing them closer to Israel,' Kozhanov explained.

Metal giants: Driving the IDF's D9 bulldozer in Gaza	The veteran bulldozer has been standing at the top of the military's armored vehicle pyramids for years and shines in complex missions across the Gaza Strip in the ongoing war In Gaza’s Philadelphi Corridor, I met a man who's in love with a D9 bulldozer, and believe me, there's no other way to describe the relationship between Warrant Officer R. and the massive metal beast standing beside us. R. takes care of his D9 like a classic car collector, maybe with a bit more tolerance for dust. And when he talks about the monstrous steel bulldozers, he reminds me of a teenager describing his first kiss. And this isn't just the excitement of a novice. R. is a career soldier in the IDF Combat Engineering Corps’ Yahalom unit. He's been operating this colossal machine for over 20 years, witnessing all the battlefronts where the IDF has been present firsthand. This time, he says, it's a completely different story. 'This isn't just another war,' says the man who was in Lebanon, the West Bank and on the Philadelphi Corridor during the days leading up to Israel’s disengagement from Gaza in 2005. 'This war is far more intense,' he admits. But despite participating in countless operations, some of which are still classified and despite having been targeted by anti-tank missiles multiple times, the real challenge in this war isn't dealing with Hamas terrorists for him. 'Taking care of the equipment is of utmost importance to me,' R. says as we cross the border into the Gaza Strip. In short, some people fear explosives, while others are more concerned about the D9’s air filter and oil changes. Charging ahead of forces The Caterpillar D9 (or 'Doobi' in IDF slang) has been manufactured by the American company Caterpillar since the 1950s. It underwent armor modifications in the IDF during the 1980s and has since served in two Lebanon wars, two intifadas in the West Bank and countless operations in the Gaza Strip. Thanks to 8 tons of steel armor — an insignificant addition to the machine's total weight of 57 tons — it can handle almost any explosive waiting for it in the alleys of Rafah and Khan Younis. Anti-tank missiles are countered by slat armor, thick mesh that surrounds the driver's cabin and the bent and charred remnants found in maintenance depots testify to the heavy fire these machines have endured. Small arms fire is as routine as brushing teeth and isn’t even discussed. In the ongoing war, the D9 is at the forefront of every maneuvering force in the Gaza Strip, whether it's an armored battalion, a Givati company or elite units. Every advance into new territory is preceded by a bulldozer reconnaissance to clear land, detect explosives, pave routes, 'shake' buildings to trigger booby traps before the troops move in, build dirt embankments for protective positions and, of course, demolish structures. Since the beginning of the war, the IDF has destroyed tens of thousands of structures in the Strip, those used for terror activities or posing a threat to its forces. Some were taken down via costly airstrikes, while others were demolished using explosives — a cheaper but riskier method for the troops. Then there’s the D9. With a skilled operator at the controls, it can demolish a residential building within an hour, flattening it to a rubble pile no higher than a meter. This debris blocks any possibility of escape from tunnel shafts and can no longer serve as cover for Hamas terrorists. A winning duo Just before R. and I climb into the towering D9 cabin, I catch Lt. Col. Ran, the 162nd Division’s engineering officer, for a quick talk. This division is the only one that operated across all the areas where the IDF was active in the Gaza Strip and hasn’t left the territory even once since the start of the ground operation. Lt. Col. Ran is less excited about the engineering machine itself and prefers to talk about the people operating it — those with the understated image of tractor drivers, who are almost never credited after yet another successful operation. 'D9 operators are tough guys with distinct characters, without exception. Think about it: it’s a duo — a driver and a vehicle commander — who work detached from their home unit and are attached to a different force that needs them each time. It takes them time to build a rapport with the unit they've joined, to trust the people and to gain confidence,' he says. There are only a few dozen engineering equipment operators serving all the maneuvering forces in the division. It’s a small group that must meet a wide array of demands from various units. 'The engineering equipment operator, like any combatant, needs a commander to say, 'follow me,'' Lt. Col. Ran explains. 'But there’s no 'follow me' here — it’s 'after them.' They drive at the front of the force with the D9 and everyone else follows. It’s a tough mental challenge, entering an alley that no one has been in before, being the first to go in. But these people are heroes, every single one of them.' One of the heroes Ran talks about is Warrant Officer R., the one with a concern for filters and a gleam in his eye, who has been on operational duty in the Gaza Strip for nearly a year, leaving behind a worried wife and three kids. 'It’s really hard on the family, but they understand the need. Since I’m a career soldier, I can’t take breaks between rotations like the reservists. My wife is a brave woman— they're the real heroes.' Over the past few weeks, the anxiety level in R.'s home has doubled as his son enlisted in the Combat Engineering Corps and will also serve as a D9 operator. For now, he’s in basic training, but he might find himself meeting his father on the front line before long. 8 km/h in third gear R. shares all of this with me as we slowly make our way from the gathering areas to Gaza’s gates, heading toward the Philadelphi Corridor. And we’ve got plenty of time to chat — the D9 moves at a painfully slow pace of 4-5 km/h at most. 'In third gear, you can get up to 8 km/h. But if you want to take care of the machine, it's best not to do that,' R. explains. It turns out that 460 horsepower is quite a lot, but you still need a bit more than that to move over 60 tons of metal on tracks at a faster pace. After crossing the border, we switch places — R. takes the commander's position and I settle into the operator's seat. That's the official title for those who maneuver the D9 and anyone who dares call them a 'driver' will, at best, get a disapproving look. The operating mechanism of this massive bulldozer is different from any other tracked vehicle I’ve driven during my compulsory and reserve service: steering is done using two levers, but only with the left hand; the right-hand controls the enormous front blade; the gas pedal provides maximum acceleration when you release it and the machine stops when you press the pedal to the floor. There's also a brake pedal, operated by the left foot — a technique more commonly seen on racetracks. But here, instead of seeking the apex with a distant gaze, you need to focus on the ground, looking at the grooves behind the blade to find the line of movement. And despite the D9's towering height, it’s not easy to see what’s happening outside. The D9 lacks a suspension system, so every bump or terrain fold is felt acutely in your back and seat. The helmet is essential for anyone who doesn’t want to accidentally headbutt the turret’s iron handle. R., having decades of experience, uses the weight of the blade, lifting and lowering it according to the terrain to stabilize the vehicle and reduce the bouncing during travel. And with a weight of 5 tons, nearly four times that of an average family car, the blade plays a critical role in balancing the bulldozer. After a few minutes of driving along the route, R. decides to up the challenge and asks me to build a defensive dirt berm. The first step goes smoothly as I gather a decent pile of sand, but then I must reverse and continue the task. However, since the reverse camera quickly gets covered in dust and loses its usefulness within the first few meters, reversing must be done the old-fashioned way — by turning around and looking over your shoulder. Once we’ve had our fill of playing in the massive sandbox along the Philadelphi Corridor, I continue forward, seizing a moment when R.’s attention wanes to shift into third gear and try to 'push the speed limit.' But a convoy passing nearby, with tanks that look like small toys next to the D9, kicks up massive clouds of red dust, forcing us to pull over. By this point, it’s easy to grade the D9's performance test: it fails entirely in categories like speed, features, driving comfort, and noise isolation and with an 18,000-cc engine, it won’t win any awards for fuel efficiency either. But the cabin is relatively spacious, with a storage cabinet for drinks and snacks behind the operator’s seat (not the driver’s). The air conditioning system also scores high and no D9 would start a workday without it. A rescue takes hours Like any vehicle we routinely test, the D9 has gone through several generations. The first was called the N, delivering 380 horsepower; the second, the L, was larger and produced 500 horsepower. The R model, which I drove, was introduced during the Second Intifada and delivers 460 horsepower. The T is the most advanced model, with improvements focusing less on engine power and more on technological aspects. These include a hydrostatic operating system that allows for faster power transfer to the tracks, along with a GPS interface with sensors attached to the blade, enabling pre-set ground height data — meaning the D9 will dig until it reaches the target on its own. There's also the Panda, the autonomous sibling of the familiar 'Doobi.' This is a development by the Israel Aerospace Industries’ Elta Division, equipped with cameras and sensors that replace the operator, with remote control capabilities that reduce risks to human lives. But during routine missions, Division 162’s combat engineering teams face challenges no less complex than those of the autonomous systems — like irrigation pipes and barbed wire from the agricultural areas around Rafah that get tangled in the D9's tracks, sometimes requiring professional aid from the fire department to untangle the metal mess. At times, they’re tasked with complicated rescues that take long hours in the mud, rain or under the blazing sun. This happens when tanks or APCs get stuck on side slopes, in massive mud puddles, with broken tracks, or after hitting an explosive. In such cases, there’s only one machine capable of rescuing them — the D9. That same trusty bulldozer, which can’t fire a single shot, has stood at the top of the IDF’s armored vehicle pyramid for decades. Alongside it, a handful of skilled operators, utterly devoted to their vehicles, wouldn't trade it for any other machine in the world.

Watch press flee Hezbollah official speech as IDF warns of attack	Journalists hurry to grab their equipment while terror group's spokesperson still speaks into rapidly disappearing microphones as Arab Language IDF spokesperson issues a warning of an imminent attack on the Dahieh Journalists covering a press event given by Hezbollah's chief spokesperson Mohammad Afif on Tuesday quickly gathered their equipment and left after an Israeli warning of an imminent attack on the Dahieh in Beirut. Afif was still speaking as television crews collected their microphones and camera gear in response to the IDF's Arabic language spokesperson, Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee's warning that identified two nearby buildings as the targets of the IDF attack. Afif insisted the journalists were not leaving because of the IDF warning. 'the attack doesn't scare them,' he said. Moments later, images from the attack began to emerge including of a building collapsing and plums of smoke rising from another. Before the rapid exit of the press corps, Afif accused the U.S. of complicity in the aggressions against Lebanon. 'The arrival of its envoy [Amos Hochstein, in Beirut] doesn't change our view that the U.S. is the mother of terrorism. We renew our trust in the Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and affirm that there will be no negotiations under fire.' He added that Israel had no justification for attacking branches of the Qard Al-Hassan Association, referred to as 'Hezbollah's bank.' 'The goal is to undermine the Lebanese people's trust. Hezbollah doesn't receive its salaries or fund its arms from this institution. Qard Al-Hassan was prepared for this day and will fulfill its obligations to those who have entrusted it with their money,' he said. 'The enemy is responsible for ensuring the safety of the hostages and we call on the International Red Cross to guarantee this. What's extracted from the prisoners under pressure is worthless. It won't be long before we have enemy captives and we'll negotiate over them,' he added before he too hurried to leave amid the warnings. 'The resistance and the command and coordination system are intact and the pace of operations is increasing,' he said before declaring that Hezbollah 'takes full and exclusive responsibility' for launching a drone toward Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea.

Israel confirms Netanyahu home target of drone strike	Minor damage is sustained in Saturday's attack targeting the prime minister's private residence in Caesarea; security around Israeli senior leaders and officials is bolstered since the attack Israel confirmed on Tuesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence was hit by an attack drone on Saturday. The house sustained minor damage. Netanyahu and his family were not home at the time of the attack. 'Iran tried to assassinate Israel's prime minister and will not escape responsibility,' a spokesperson for the government said 72 hours after Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack. Security measures around Israeli leaders and senior officials have been increased since the strike. Earlier this morning, the Saudi Al Hadath channel reported quoting sources, that Israel confirmed Iranian involvement in the launching of an attack drone on Netanyahu's home. 'Officials in Iran's embassy in Beirut are involved in an attempted assassination of Netanyahu,' the channel said. On Saturday, Netanyahu posted a clip where he was seen walking in Jerusalem. 'Iran's proxies who tried to assassinate me and my wife today made a grave mistake,' Netanyahu said. He vowed that the incident would not deter Israel from its mission. 'This will not stop me or Israel from continuing our fight for security,' he said. 'I say to Iran and its partners in the axis of evil: anyone who harms Israeli citizens will pay a heavy price.' A preliminary investigation revealed that the helicopter that detected the drone failed to identify it, leading to sirens being activated only in military areas and not in Caesarea. Following the strike, security forces, bomb squads and emergency teams rushed to the scene, including property damage assessors from the Israel Tax Authority.

Netanyahu's confidant and shadow emissary: Meet Ron Dermer	Ron Dermer, Israel's quite secretive government minister, remains disconnected from the public while forging deep ties with JINSA, a Washington-based think tank; His appearances before Knesset committees have been rare and cloaked in confidentiality, leaving no public record of his attendance; His efforts advocating for a controversial US-Israel mutual defense pac could significantly alter Israel's security strategy Since the start of the war in Gaza, Ron Dermer, Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs, has been conspicuously absent from the public eye and has not briefed the Knesset on his activities. Yet, he plays a critical role in shaping the nation’s war strategy. In recent months, especially following the departure of former IDF Chiefs of Staff Benny Gantz and Gadi Eizenkot from the government, Dermer has emerged as one of the top three war decision-makers, alongside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. He has been instrumental in key decisions, such as retaining control of the Philadelphi Corridor, even at the expense of a potential hostage deal, and has been involved in high-level discussions about targeting Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Dermer has also accompanied Netanyahu to the United Nations and assumed responsibility for proposing mechanisms to conclude the conflict in Lebanon. Despite his significant influence on national policy, Dermer's actions suggest a lack of engagement with the Israeli public. An investigation by Telem magazine, assisted by Uri Tuval from the Berl Katznelson Foundation, reveals that Dermer has scarcely communicated with the Israeli populace. Since becoming a minister, his appearances before Knesset committees, particularly the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, have been rare and cloaked in confidentiality, leaving no public record of his attendance. Dermer, who advocates for transparent hearings for Supreme Court nominees in line with American constitutional practices, does not apply these standards to himself and refrains from openly reporting his actions to the public or its representatives. He also avoids using social media or other communication channels to update the public on his activities. His Twitter posts are predominantly in English, and since October 7, only three tweets about Israeli holidays like Holocaust Remembrance Day and Purim have been in Hebrew. Unlike other ministers and politicians, Dermer does not produce video updates for the public or respond to daily events. Furthermore, Dermer does not grant interviews to Israeli media. Although he has held public roles for about 12 years, such as Israel's ambassador and economic attaché in the U.S., Telem could find only one interview with an Israeli media outlet since October 7. In that interview, Dermer explained his boycott of Israeli media dating back to 2009, due to a journalist allegedly not seeking his comment on a story about Netanyahu. While ignoring the Israeli public, Dermer frequently appears on foreign television networks, international podcasts, and gives personal interviews. The investigation struggled to find even a brief statement from him in an Israeli newspaper (Israel Hayom) since October 7. It seems Dermer has little interest in engaging with the Israeli public. On the other hand, Dermer's schedules from January 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024, reveal that Netanyahu is Dermer's sole authority figure. Dermer has been closely aligned with Netanyahu since 2000, when Netanyahu was on a hiatus from public life. Upon Netanyahu’s return to politics in 2002, Dermer began receiving roles from him: advisor in his office when he was finance minister, economic attaché in Washington, political advisor in his office when elected prime minister in 2009, and from 2013 to 2021, ambassador to the United States. Dermer also authored Netanyahu’s speeches in English. Even after becoming a minister, Dermer appears to view himself more as Netanyahu's personal advisor than a public decision-maker. Telem magazine's investigation discovered that in the 15 months covered by the diaries, Dermer held 570 meetings, sessions and discussions with Netanyahu, alongside dozens of government and cabinet meetings, averaging nearly two meetings per working day. Interestingly, when they converse privately, they speak in English. In contrast, during July-September 2023, amid the start of the school year and before the war broke out, Education Minister Yoav Kish had only three personal meetings with Netanyahu, averaging 0.04 meetings per working day. A hawkish stance on US-Israel relations While he remains elusive and uncommunicative with the Israeli public, a recent revelation has uncovered his deep ties with the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA). This Washington-based think tank, known for its Republican and hawkish stance, could potentially reshape Israel's security doctrine. JINSA is deeply entrenched in Republican circles and often criticizes President Joe Biden. Notable figures within JINSA include Elliott Abrams, a former deputy national security advisor under the envoy on Iran to presidents Bush and Trump, who also chairs the Tikvah Fund, a financial backer of the Kohelet Policy Forum. Another prominent figure is Major General Yaakov Amidror, a former head of Israel's National Security Council. In July 2021, Dermer joined JINSA as a research fellow. The organization primarily advocates for a mutual defense pact between Israel and the United States, which would obligate the U.S. to respond militarily if Israel were attacked. Historically, Israel's defense establishment has resisted such agreements, fearing that they might restrict Israel's military independence and necessitate U.S. approval for major actions like striking Iran, effectively making Israel a client state. JINSA argues such an agreement would bolster Israeli deterrence, though it is largely motivated by American interests, as it would require Israel to purchase more American arms. Since moving from JINSA to the Israeli government, Dermer has been a forceful advocate for this agreement. Reports suggest that in August 2023, Netanyahu dispatched him to Washington to engage with senior U.S. officials to advance this agreement, as part of broader normalization efforts with Saudi Arabia. Dermer's diaries reveal that during these discussions he maintained a close relationship with JINSA officials, especially its President and CEO, Michael Makovsky. In the first 15 months of his ministerial tenure, Dermer met or communicated with JINSA representatives 23 times. In the summer of 2023, as he pushed the defense agreement agenda with Netanyahu, the IDF chief of staff, the White House, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Dermer's interactions with JINSA intensified, with 13 meetings or conversations, including visits from JINSA leaders to his office in Jerusalem. Meanwhile, JINSA drafted a comprehensive mutual defense agreement and organized events aimed at swaying American public opinion, particularly among decision-makers. Thus, Dermer, who remains silent toward Israeli citizens, is deeply engaged with an American organization funded by private money, working behind the scenes to orchestrate a significant shift in Israel's security approach and policy.

It's the greatest pain there is': 3 parents talk about losing an...	Hundreds of families suffered the death of loved ones in the Hamas' massacre on October 7; 3 parents say the void left by the loss of their only child is dark and engulfing The pain of losing a child is unbearable, and studies show it's the most difficult loss to recover from. It becomes exponentially more intense when it involves an only child, leaving the parents alone. According to data from Israel’s National Insurance Institute, 121 parents lost their loved ones and were left without any other children since October 7. This is the story of three of them. David Levy, father of Lidor Since the murder of Lidor Levy, 27, and his girlfriend, Nitzan Rachum near the site of the Nova Music Festival, his parents have been living in the couple's home. 'I can't explain it,' David, Lidor's father, says. 'Everything in life feels strange since then. Lidor's motorcycle is still in the living room, his wardrobe is still neatly arranged. Everything is just as it was. I went to our house once or twice to get a few things and I couldn't even go inside.' 'Nitzan was pregnant, in her fourth month,' he says. 'We were going to have a grandchild. The whole extended family gathered on the evening of Simchat Torah and that's when they shared the news about the pregnancy. Everyone jumped on me, calling me grandpa; it was such an exciting moment. Lidor was everything we had and now we have nothing.' When the massacre at the Nova festival began, Lidor and Nitzan fled and managed to reach a shelter near Re'im. 'We didn't get to speak to him that morning,' David says. 'We know Nitzan spoke to her mother and said they were being shot at.' 'We searched for any clue for days, trying to get information. We already knew what had happened in our hearts, but we kept hoping it wasn't true, thinking maybe he was taken hostage. Everything was racing through our minds. We got the news on Monday,' he added. 'The days are incredibly difficult,' he describes. 'We're doing everything on autopilot. There's no desire to do anything, not even eat food. I don't want anything. My wife, who has cancer, has lost at least 10 kilograms. I feel as if we're still living on October 7 even now.' 'Lidor was our only son and I think it's the greatest pain there is. Everything I did in life was for him. Now, I feel half alive. I fight to change my thoughts all day long, to keep from falling into an abyss.' Polina Dov, mother of Racheli When reports of the massacre near the Gaza border began coming in on the morning of October 7, Polina Dov, the mother of Racheli, decided to drive from her home near Haifa to Kibbutz Re'im to look for her. 'I didn't know she'd gone to the Nova festival until that morning,' she says. 'I woke up around 8:30 a.m. and saw a message from her that had come in at 6:51 a.m.: 'Mom, there's shooting. We were at the party, we're running home.' I tried calling her, sent messages and she didn't answer. I decided to go and save my daughter.' Polina set out with her husband and their friend. 'During the drive, I spoke with her friends to try to figure out where she was,' she recalls. 'Around 11:00 a.m., my brother sent me a message with a photo he found on Telegram with Arabic writing on it. It showed Racheli in a car, injured.' 'I'm a nurse by profession, so I had to understand the situation, but my brain wasn’t working at that moment. I only wanted to save her. Now I can say that it was clear she wouldn’t survive from the first glance of the photo.' It was only by the afternoon that Polina managed to get the phone number of one of the two friends who were with Racheli. 'They told me that Racheli was injured and that they were losing her,' she says. 'I didn’t know she was already gone by then. One of her friends was also injured. I begged them to keep her warm, to put something on the wound. As we got closer to the area, we encountered a police blockade trying to stop us. I remember screaming and kicking them, saying my daughter was there and they just let us go. It looked like a battlefield. We drove past bodies, missiles and gunfire everywhere.' Polina later learned that Racheli tried to escape with her two friends when the attack started. They encountered terrorists dressed in IDF uniforms and their car was shot at. Racheli, who was sitting in the back, ducked to hide and a bullet that entered through the door struck her below the armpit. They managed to get off the road, drive to a forest near Kisufim and hide there, but Racheli succumbed to her wounds shortly after. 'We met a Maglan unit on the way to Kisufim,' Polina says. 'I convinced them to send a rescue team, and I got a message at 19:08 p.m. saying they had picked them up in a jeep. I believed she was alive until the very last moment. I went from hospital to hospital looking for my daughter until Tuesday.' 'That day, I went to the police to give a DNA sample and then returned home. In the afternoon, there was a knock on the door and they said she had been identified. I couldn’t save Racheli, but we managed to save her two friends.' Racheli was 25 years old. 'Racheli was a joyful, charismatic child, a true freedom fighter,' Polina describes. 'Everyone talked about her unique laughter. When she was 14, her father was murdered by someone who was mentally ill.' 'It was tough for her as an only child, but she grew from it, from the pain. She was strong, unbeatable. I miss her but I feel her presence all the time. I know she's watching over us and she gives me strength despite the hardship.' Rachel Vaknin, mother of Osher and Michael Since the murder of her twin sons, Osher and Michael Vaknin, 35, it's been hard for their mother, Rachel, to stay at home. 'I’m overwhelmed with grief,' she explains. 'They lived here with me and we were very close. I can’t be here since they died. It’s too hard to be alone.' They were each other's best friends. Born together, raised together, worked together and met their end together. 'They were one in two bodies,' Rachel describes, 'one couldn’t live without the other. They argued, they fought, they loved, they hugged.' 'They did everything together. They organized the Nova festival with Elkana Bohbot, who’s still being held captive in Gaza. They knew how to bring joy to people and they did it in the best way possible.' She has one regret: 'I’m so sorry I didn’t hug and kiss them tightly when they left the house for the party on Friday. I only told them to take care of themselves and that was it. They answered, ‘Everything will be fine, Mom,’ and left with their friends. Some managed to escape and return, and some were murdered along with them.' 'That morning, after I saw the chaos on television, I called them and sent so many messages. I asked Michael to look after Osher and Osher to look after Michael. Osher didn’t answer me. Michael did and he just said, ‘Mom.’ He was probably hiding somewhere.' Now she’s alone. 'It hurts so much,' Rachel says. 'They were angels who spread joy, love and peace at home. Everyone loved them. I miss their laughter, their hugs and their kisses. I pray they send me strength and health to keep living and continue remembering them until I’ll see them again one day.' ‘A vast void’ 'Of all experiences of grief, the loss of a child is the most difficult and there's research to back this up,' explains clinical social worker and psychotherapist Dina Dror from Elah Center NGO which provides psychological support in cases of loss and trauma. 'Parents aren't supposed to outlive their children by nature. A loss that leaves parents without any children creates a vast void in their lives, leaving them with a profound sense of emptiness, sadness, anger, the physical pain of absence, and an emotional pain that’s incredibly hard to bear. Coping with grief is especially difficult and complex in such cases,' according to Dror. 'From our experience in treating and supporting bereaved families, I can say that parents say the pain and longing persist and don’t go away, but they stop confronting it every day over time. Even if it seems impossible now, there’s life in a different reality within this sea of pain.'

These are the 12 fallen Druze heroes who gave their life to defen...	The Druze community have always been a major pillar of Israeli society, and their commitment to the safety of the Israeli people have been well documented; This is a list of the dozen Druze warriors who made the ultimate sacrifice Since the start of the Gaza war, 12 Druze soldiers have fallen. The highest-ranking among them fell this week: Colonel Ehsan Daxa, commander of the 401st Brigade, who died in battle in Jabaliya at the age of 41. He was laid to rest on Monday in his hometown of Daliyat al-Karmel, accompanied by thousands, including Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, other officers, and community leaders who paid their respects. The first Druze soldier to fall was Staff Sergeant Daniel Rashed, who died fighting Hamas terrorists on October 7. At 19, he is survived by his parents and three siblings. Rashed, initially declared missing for two weeks after the massacre, dreamed of joining the Golani Brigade, inspired by former Golani commander Ghassan Alian, a figure many young people from Shefa-'Amr admire and wish to emulate. Just weeks before completing the combat course with the 13th Battalion, Daniel stumbled and broke his leg. However, he persevered, remained with the battalion, and joined the fighting on that fateful Saturday. Lt. Col. Alim Saad, deputy commander of the 300th Brigade, was killed in a clash with infiltrators from Lebanon on the war's second day. Saad was 41 and is survived by a wife and three children. He had planned to retire for studies but decided to continue serving after the war broke out. He was killed in Adamit, near the Israel-Lebanon border. Sergeant First Class Jawad Amer, 23, from the village of Hurfeish, a live-fire zone manager, also died in the encounter with infiltrators from the Lebanese border, in the same incident as Lt. Col. Saad. Many members of the Amer family from the Druze village of Hurfeish have been killed in Israel's battles. Jawad, who aspired to follow his brother's path into electrical and software engineering in the high-tech sector, was scheduled for release a week before he was killed. Lt. Col. Salman Habaka, from Yanuh-Jat, commander of the 53rd Battalion of the 188th Armored Brigade, fell in battle in northern Gaza. At 33, he he is survivied by his wife and a two-year-old child. Habaka was one of the heroes of the Kibbutz Be'eri battle, leaving his family on October 7 to head south. In chilling footage, Salman recounted that Saturday morning and the battle he fought in Be'eri: 'I am proud of my fighters; they are true heroes. They quickly reached the tanks, acted swiftly, decisively and fought with the determination I expect from them. The 53rd Battalion is meant to lead to victory and will continue to lead to victory – big and small. Our hand will remain on top at all times, and we will not let inhumane and cowardly behavior crush our spirit. We will rise stronger in unity and strength and strike back,' he said. Major Jamal Abbas from Peki'in, a company commander in the 101st Battalion of the Paratroopers Brigade, fell in battle in Gaza at 23. He hailed from a family of fighters with a combat tradition stretching from his grandfather Gideon to the youngest grandchildren. Before Jamal was killed in Gaza, his father and brother managed to reach him on the Israeli military communication network. His father, Anan, who serves as a reserve colonel, said: 'You are the spearhead of the fighters, take care of yourselves.' Staff Sergeant Adi Harb, 19, from Beit Jann, who fought in the Nahal Brigade's reconnaissance unit, was killed in battle in Gaza. He enlisted about a year ago to become a combat soldier, fulfilling a lifelong aspiration. He was killed in combat in the Gaza Strip, leaving behind parents, four sisters, and a brother. Adi was supposed to celebrate his 20th birthday the week he died, and his family mourned: 'We hadn't seen you, Adi, for 43 days, and we were all eagerly waiting for Thursday, November 23, to celebrate your 20th birthday with you. How could we not wait? We already envisioned you in our minds, rising above our shoulders in endless joy for another birthday,' they said with pain. Staff Sergeant Sofian Dagesh, 21, from Mag har, a soldier in the 601st Engineering Battalion of the 'Iron Trails' Brigade (401), fell in battle in northern Gaza. On the 70th day of the war, he wrote: 'After months of not seeing home, I miss everyone. I've seen everything in this war and also grown and learned a lot. All this comes at a very high price – I lost friends, lost partners, and witnessed difficult scenes.' Master Sergeant Anwar Sarhan, 26, from Hurfeish, was involved in an accident between a military jeep and a truck near Gush Etzion, a cluster of Israeli settlements located in the Judaean Mountains. The vehicle overturned, and the ammunition inside began to burn and explode. Medics attempted to rescue the wounded but pronounced Sarhan dead at the scene. The spiritual leader of the Druze community eulogized him: 'Anwar's 100 days of reserve duty encapsulate his life's essence. He was the first to help, friendly, volunteering for every task, a young man who loved life and helping others.' Captain Wassem Mahmoud, 23, from Beit Jann, deputy company commander in the 601st Battalion, died in battle in southern Gaza. Wassem was killed in a severe incident in Rafah. He commanded an armored personnel carrier with soldiers inside that was hit by an explosive device. His acquaintances said he was expected to be discharged from the IDF and start studying, but he was killed on the night of Eid al-Adha. All events in his village were canceled in solidarity and appreciation. Wasim's grandfather was the first Druze casualty in Beit Jann. On April 1, he was supposed to go on a three-month leave before studying, but instead, he stayed in the army to fight with his soldiers. Captain Jalaa Ibrahem from Sajur, 25, a company commander in the 601st Engineering Battalion, fell in battle in southern Gaza. He is survived by a mother and 12 siblings, many in significant security roles. Jalaa was the fourth sibling in his family to serve in the Engineering Corps. Jaza Ibrahem, Jalaa's brother serving as an officer in the 91st Division, said, 'The last time he was home was on June 15th, on the night of Eid al-Adha. On that day, Captain Wassem Mahmoud from Beit Jann was killed. He went there because he knew him. After that, he came home, said goodbye to everyone, and went to Gaza.' He added: 'We urged him to stay, but he wanted to return so badly. Unfortunately, I didn't get to say goodbye to him. We are four officers in the Engineering Corps and two more in the police and Border Police, living through the war daily. In the army, we mentally prepare ourselves for the worst, and in the end, statistics touch everyone. We're six siblings, so unfortunately, it doesn't skip us. I was personally ready for it, but the pain still hits hard.' Major (res.) Nail Fawarsa, 43, from Maghar in the Lower Galilee, commander of the headquarters company in the Haruv Battalion, was killed about a month ago by a drone strike in the Yaara area. Nail married two years ago and left behind a wife and a five-month-old baby. 'His son will never see his father again,' said his widow in a choked voice. 'He loved the country so much – and died for it.' The Druze community in Israel makes up 1.6% of the total population, with over 85% enlisting, most in combat units, despite severe hardships in their alliance with the State of Israel. Druze localities have suffered from years of discriminatory policies, housing shortages, and hundreds of demolition orders, even for soldiers currently on the front lines. Some 10,000 homes of Druze citizens are connected to illegal electricity due to unregulated construction in all Druze localities, and so far, the government does not seem interested in improving the situation for the community, which has forged a blood pact with Israel.

The United Nations Palestinian refugee agency called on Tuesday for a temporary truce to allow people to leave areas of northern Gaza as health officials said they were running out of supplies to treat patients hurt in a three-week-old Israeli offensive. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UNRWA relief agency, said the humanitarian situation had reached a dire point, with bodies abandoned by roadsides or buried under rubble The call came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel looking for ways of reviving attempts to reach a cease-fire in Gaza, following the death of former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar almost a week ago.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1asj11sgkg	2024-10-22T03:34:12-07:00

EU lawmakers clear up to 35 bln euro loan for Ukraine, using Russ...	European Union lawmakers on Tuesday approved the bloc's plan to use frozen Russian central bank assets to loan up to 35 billion euros ($38 billion) to its ally Ukraine. The European Parliament voted by 518 in favour to 56 against, with 61 abstentions, for the planned loan to Kyiv in the last legislative step after EU governments agreed the plan earlier in October. The G7 plans to provide an overall loan of $50 billion to help Ukraine, serviced by profits generated by Russian assets immobilized in the West. These assets were frozen shortly after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. More than two-thirds of the assets, some 210 billion euros, are stuck in the 27-nation European Union, mostly with Belgium's asset safekeeping and servicing company Euroclear. Britain announced on Monday it would lend Ukraine 2.26 billion pounds ($2.9 billion).

War knocked human development in Gaza back to 1955, UNDP says	The war in Gaza has devastated the Palestinian economy, which is now 35% smaller than it was at the start of Israel's operation a year ago, while development levels in Gaza itself have collapsed to the level of the 1950s, the UN's development agency said. Launching a new study on the socioeconomic impacts of the war, the UNDP's Chitose Noguchi said that by some measures the region's poverty level was now approaching 100% as a result of the disruption, with unemployment now at 80%.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by09wlbx1l	2024-10-22T03:00:32-07:00	
The Jewish anti-Israel candidate that could hand Trump the presid...	Green Party leader Jill Stein has renewed her independent campaign in the 2024 U.S. presidential election and Democrats fear siphoning of votes could win Trump the presidency as it did back in 2016 Hillary Clinton's loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 elections had many reasons, but if you ask Democratic Party activists, they'll point first and foremost to one woman: Jill Stein. The 74-year-old Jewish activist ran in 2016 as the Green Party's candidate, clearly targeting left-leaning voters. When the votes were counted, it turned out that in the three states considered the 'blue wall' supporting Democratic candidates – Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — Stein received several tens of thousands more votes than the total margin by which Donald Trump won those states at the time. This trauma haunts the Democrats now as well, deep into the 2024 election. In a race that's expected to be even tighter than 2016, Jill Stein could once again hand Trump the victory. National polls give her around 1% of the vote, and that could be enough to tip the scale. 'I like her very much,' Trump said of Stein at a rally in June. 'You know why? She takes 100% from them.' Independent candidates can't win elections in the U.S., but in a deeply polarized reality where every vote in a small number of states carries disproportionate importance, a third-party candidate can change the game. Democrats have felt this twice in the 21st century. In 2000, independent candidate Ralph Nader, Stein's predecessor as Green Party leader, won 95,000 votes in Florida — and George Bush defeated Al Gore in Florida by a margin of 600 votes following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, winning the entire race. This time, Democrats are running an aggressive campaign against Stein, including financial investments in television ads saying, 'Jill Stein helped Trump once. Don't let her do it again.' Stein, a physician, is considered far-left, but partly because of her isolationist agenda — including support for Russia and opposition to U.S. support for Israel — she attracts voters who embody the famous horseshoe theory: the far left and far right are very close to each other. Things reached the point where Stein received an endorsement from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke last week and her campaign had to publicly distance itself from him. Stein insists there's no chance she'll withdraw from the race, no matter who pressures her, including her own children. 'For her political activities, she does not have the support of the family. When she told us she was going to run again back in October 2023, we asked her not to,' one of her sons told The New York Times.

IDF at height of Lebanon operation to remove Galilee invasion thr...	Four divisions and hundreds of troops are operating in southern Lebanon to dismantle Hezbollah's capabilities as terrorists retreat further north; IDF estimates a third of terror group's arsenal destroyed The IDF reached the height of its ground operation in southern Lebanon on Tuesday, with four divisions operating in the region for the last three weeks, effectively covering all Hezbollah sectors in the area. The IDF is also deploying new brigades, mainly of reserve soldiers, to eliminate the threat of Hezbollah's plan to invade the Galilee. The IDF has also in recent days advanced to larger towns near the border and the deepest points of the ground operation, which remains confined to areas close to the border. The forces have observed that hundreds of Hezbollah operatives left in the region are retreating to hide in their terror tunnels, trying to survive until the situation eases. They only emerge from the tunnels in small groups to engage IDF forces if they see an opportunity to set off an explosive device or fire at close range. Soldiers are injured almost daily in these skirmishes, but the numbers are relatively low compared to the war’s scale. According to IDF estimates, dozens of Hezbollah terrorists are killed for each wounded soldier. A key objective for the troops, as was reported by Ynet, is to capture as many Hezbollah operatives as possible for intelligence extraction during interrogations. Dozens of operatives have already been captured alive and delivered to detention centers in Israel. Some forces, particularly those from the 98th Division, which were the first to enter southern Lebanon, have moved on to the phase of clearing and flattening munition launch and firing infrastructure targeting the Galilee. This involves hundreds of structures along the border that oversee Israeli settlements and military outposts, now being destroyed using engineering equipment like D9 bulldozers or via controlled detonations. The forces have also managed to identify and ascertain the number of launches carried out from each house over the past year toward Israeli towns such as Margaliot, Manara or Metula from each individual building. Rows of destroyed buildings can be clearly seen in videos captured by drones – these structures had been used by Hezbollah to fire directly or indirectly at Israel over the past few months. In the final stage of the ground operation in Lebanon, which is expected to conclude within a few weeks according to the IDF Northern Command's plan, the military aims to destroy thousands of dunams of fortified wooded areas, mainly in the western sector, through unique combat engineering efforts. Some of these methods will be innovative, even compared to similar clearing operations carried out in the buffer zone the IDF has been establishing along the Gaza border over the past year. The IDF Northern Command is already formulating a plan to enforce and maintain these achievements following the ground operation, as well as in the event of a political agreement or cease-fire, if reached. This will primarily involve kinetic responses to any violation or renewal of terror infrastructure near the border. However, the implementation of this plan during routine times will depend on lawmaker approval, as any such strike could escalate into a day or two of fighting in the north, similar to the 'rounds' of conflict southern residents have experienced since the early 2010s. According to Northern Command estimates, the IDF has so far neutralized about one-third of Hezbollah's arsenal, including rockets, missiles and drones. The military said its forces have overpowered the Radwan Force’s front-line attack zones as part of the ground operation, though several more weeks will be required to complete these missions. IDF data indicates that seven Hezbollah battalion commanders, 21 company commanders and over 25 platoon leaders or deputy company commanders responsible for villages in southern Lebanon have been eliminated during the ground operation and the weeks leading up to it. 'Most of Hezbollah's commanders, from the top leadership down to the tactical level, have been hit or killed,' the military estimated. 'Overall, about 1,200 operatives have been killed in the ground operation, with over 2,000 in total. A diplomatic effort will be needed to complement the military action, and the IDF believes Hezbollah won't be allowed to return to southern Lebanon.'

U.S. proposal for northern cease-fire revealed, criticized for vi...	Following discussions between U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, and Lebanon's PM and parliament speaker, Hezbollah news service Al-Akhbar reveals the specifics of a fresh proposal aimed at resolving northern tensions; Plan involves extending international forces' jurisdiction north of Litani River, but Prime Minister Najib Mikati rejects Western oversight The Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, aligned with Hezbollah, reported Tuesday morning that Amos Hochstein, the special Mideast envoy for President Joe Biden, introduced a new proposal during his visit to Beirut. The proposal aims for a political resolution on the northern front by amending UN Security Council Resolution 1701. According to the Al-Akhbar report, Hochstein seeks to revise the preamble to transform it into a resolution targeting peace along the Lebanon-Israel border and to prevent an armed presence in Lebanese areas near the border. Hochstein discussed these details in a meeting on Monday in Beirut with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament Nabih Berri. 'The U.S. wants to end the conflict entirely, and we must devise a formula to put a definitive end to it,' Hochstein said. 'We need to ensure all parties understand that Resolution 1701 must be implemented. We are committed to resolving the conflict based on this resolution.' The report pointed out that Hochstein's proposal includes extending the geographical scope of international decision-making authority north of the Litani River, increasing the number of international forces operating within the peacekeeping forces, and boosting the number of military forces intended to be deployed in this region. The proposal reportedly also suggests expanding the missions of the international forces (UNIFIL) to grant them the right to inspect any location, vehicle or house suspected of containing weapons, and to conduct surprise patrols in any area without needing approval from Lebanese authorities (except in cases of intrusion into private property). Hochstein’s proposal further includes broadening the operations of international forces along the Lebanese coasts, including monitoring Lebanese seaports and inspecting ships, deploying monitoring teams at active or closed civilian airports, and establishing watchtowers and checkpoints along the Lebanon-Syria border. The report noted that Berri told Hochstein that Resolution 1701 is clear and requires no amendment. The report also indicates that the U.S. envoy was effectively trying to entice Lebanon with his proposals. Sources from the newspaper reported that any new mechanism must provide similar measures on both sides of the border and ensure there are no 'Israeli violations on land, sea or air.' Furthermore, according to Hezbollah, any discussion will not address the organization's weapons outside the geographical scope of Resolution 1701. Additionally, Hezbollah rejects the deployment of international or foreign forces along the border with Syria, as it contradicts Lebanese sovereignty. Hezbollah also claims the UN Security Council cannot add a new country to the states operating in the international forces without obtaining full Lebanese consent. The organization further rejects American and British oversight of the international forces' operational mechanism.

These are the 5 men that will lead Hamas in place of Sinwar	Five instead of one: A senior council based in Qatar will lead the terrorist organization in place of Yahya Sinwar, killed last week in Gaza A senior council will replace Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by Israeli troops last week in Rafah, as head of the Gaza terror group Hamas, two Hamas officials told the French news agency, AFP. 'The Hamas leadership’s approach is not to appoint a successor to the late chief, the martyr Yahya Sinwar, until their next elections' scheduled for March 'if conditions permit,' a well-informed source from the Palestinian group told AFP. The council, which includes five members, was established after the assassination in August of the head of the Hamas Political Bureau, Ismail Haniyeh, following the difficulty in communicating with Sinwar in Gaza. The council, based in Doha, Qatar, includes the representative of Hamas in Gaza, Khalil al-Haya; the representative of Hamas in the West Bank, Zaher Jabarin; the Hamas representative of Palestinians abroad, Khaled Mashaal; as well as the head of the Shura Council of Hamas, Mohammed Darwish. The name of the fifth member, the secretary of the Political Bureau, was not published since he is never identified 'for security reasons.' Another source in Hamas said that the leadership of the terrorist organization discussed the question of appointing a new leader without announcing him by name - but this possibility was dropped. These are the members of the council that will replace Sinwar to lead Hamas: Khaled Mashaal Mashaal is considered one of the most powerful people in the political bureau of Hamas, but his views differed from those of Sinwar - also, including when it comes to the relationship with Iran. Mashaal is currently the leader of Hamas abroad. He headed the political bureau of Hamas for 21 years, from 1996 to 2017, when he decided to end his position, and was replaced by Haniyeh. In 2021, he was elected again as the leader of Hamas abroad in an attempt to return to the arena Palestinian politics. In 1997, he was saved from an assassination attempt on his life in a failed Mossad operation in Jordan. Mashaal was indicted last month in the U.S. for involvement in the October 7 massacre. He lives a luxurious life in Qatar, and in the past his fortune was estimated at $4 billion to $5 billion. In recent days there has been a round of interviews to mark the anniversary of the October 7 massacre. In one of the interviews Mashaal caused a stir when he claimed that Hamas' losses are 'tactical,' while Israel's losses are 'strategic,' especially in the international arena. He was criticized by residents of Gaza and also by the members of the Fatah leadership, who appeared to grow closer to Mashaal after the elimination of Haniyeh. Regarding that assassination, Mashaal said - probably by mistake - that 'Iran killed Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.' Khalil al-Haya Khalil al-Haya, Sinwar's deputy, left the Gaza Strip before October 7 - and since then he is considered one of the senior leaders conducting the negotiations for a cease-fire and a hostage deal on behalf of the terrorist organization. Al-Haya also has a good relationship with Iran - where he arrived after the elimination of Haniyeh to participate in his funeral. The New York Times reported that Al-Haya was part of the 'limited military council' that Sinwar convened for two years to plan the October 7 attack, and was also the special envoy for the secret talks that took place on the subject with Iran and Hezbollah. Six months ago Al-Haya signaled that Hamas would not agree to a deal until the end of the war. 'If we are not promised that the war will end, why would I agree to hand over the hostages?' he said. In the same interview with the AP news agency, al-Haya claimed that the IDF had not destroyed even 20% of Hamas' capabilities at the time. 'The solution is to reach agreements,' he said. When asked if he regrets the October 7 massacre, he replied that he does not - despite the destruction in the Gaza Strip. He asked rhetorically: 'Suppose they destroy Hamas. Will the Palestinian people disappear?' Zaher Jabarin Jabarin, 55, is considered the 'economic brain' of Hamas. He served as the holder of the prisoner file in Hamas and was the deputy leader of the terrorist organization in the West Bank until the assassination of Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut. A comprehensive article in the Wall Street Journal after that assassination reported that in recent years Jabarin has become the de facto supervisor of an economic empire that the United States estimates is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, an empire that finances the terrorist activities of Hamas. Jabarin is the one who manages Hamas' financial ties with Iran on behalf of Hamas and, according to U.S. and Israeli sources, takes care of the transfer of funds from Tehran to the Gaza Strip. He is also responsible for a series of companies that transfer regular income to Hamas, and operates a network of private supporters and businessmen who transfer funds to the terrorist organization. Mohamed Ismail Darwish The relatively unknown among the members of the council is Mohamed Ismail Darwish, also known as Abu Omar Hassan, who heads the Shura Council of Hamas. A week after Haniyeh's assassination in Tehran, it was reported that he had been chosen to replace him as head of the Political Bureau - but then Hamas announced that Sinwar had been appointed as his successor.

7 East Jerusalem residents arrested for plotting assassinations	Arrests made after joint investigation by Shin Bet and the Jerusalem Metropolitan Police; They admitted that the main motive was nationalistic; Comes a day after a serious espionage case was announced, in which seven northern residents suspected of carrying out missions for the Islamic Republic were arrested Seven young men between the ages of 19 and 23, residents of Beit Hanina in East Jerusalem, were arrested on suspicion of planning to eliminate a nuclear scientist and the mayor of a city in the center of the country. This is a joint investigation by the Shin Bet and the Jerusalem police. The arrests first announced on Tuesday morning follow a joint investigation by the Shin Bet and the Jerusalem police. The investigation revealed that an Iranian official contacted the main suspect, named Rami Aliyan, who recruited him and gave him tasks in exchange for money. The suspect managed to recruit six more people from his neighborhood to carry out the tasks, including setting fire to vehicles in Ein Kerem, spray painting graffiti and throwing a grenade at the house of a security forces member. In addition, they received instructions to purchase weapons and grenades. The main task that the Iranian handler asked them to carry out included gathering intelligence on the mayors a city in the center of the country and assassinating one of the country's top nuclear scientists. The young men prepared the required intelligence and even made contacts to purchase weapons, but were arrested before they could complete the moves. Each of those involved has incriminated himself, and they were arrested in September. An indictment is expected to be filed against them Wednesday, after a prosecutor's statement has been submitted. Aliyan acted under the instructions of Iran, which provided him with precise details regarding the target of the assassination, and the young men were supposed to carry out preparation in the field. Although they failed to purchase the required weapons, the Iranians transferred funds to them to carry out the operations. The investigation revealed that the young men received different payments for different tasks: • 500 shekels for photographing various places, including the Weizmann Institute. • 1,500 shekels for photographing a certain destination. • 2,000 shekels for burning a car. • $100 for spraying graffiti against the state, and 'return the hostages now.' • Between 13,000 and 15,000 shekels were allocated for the purchase of guns and rifles , but they did not have enough time to complete the transaction. During the investigation, some of the suspects admitted to being in contact with the Iranians and carrying out the operations, and said that the main motive was nationalistic. The arrests come a day after a serious espionage case was revealed, also involving Iran, in which seven Israelis who immigrated from Azerbaijan, including a father and son, are suspected of having maintained contact for two years with elements in the Islamic Republic - as part of which they photographed military bases, which were also the targets of the ballistic missile attack from Iran earlier this month. Some of the seven were caught when they were following an Israeli senior official and his son, whom they allegedly planned to assassinate. It is described as one of the most severe security breaches in Israel's history. The Rishon Letzion Magistrate's Court revealed on Monday that the seven, all residents of Haifa and northern Israel, will be indicted on Friday. Among the suspects are a soldier who deserted from duty and two minors. The suspects—Aziz Nisanov, Alexander Sadikov, Yigal Nisan, Vyacheslav Guschin, Yevgeni Ioffe and the two minors—were arrested on September 19 on suspicion of espionage. The indictment will include charges of collaborating with enemies of the state, which carries a potential life sentence. The suspects allegedly worked under the direction of Iranian operatives in exchange for hundreds of thousands of shekels paid in cash and cryptocurrency.

There are 1.2 million displaced people in Lebanon and the fear of...	Lebanon is unable to cope with the masses of displaced people who left their homes because of the war between Israel and Hezbollah, and many of them are staying in tents; In a poor country unprepared for such a crisis, a full-blown sectarian conflict could rip the country apart The Lebanese government estimates that over 1.2 million people have been displaced due to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The country, already struggling economically, was unprepared for the massive influx of refugees from various regions and for such an extended period of time. This inability to provide adequate living conditions to everyone has only heightened existing tensions on Lebanon's streets. On Monday, Lebanese security forces clashed with refugees on Al-Hamra Street in Beirut, who were asked to vacate the Hamra Star building. Protesters responded by blocking the road with burning tires, leading the Lebanese army to intervene to restore order. The dispute over the building has been brewing for some time. Property owners have been trying to relocate displaced families, who have settled there, to alternative shelter centers, but the families are resisting eviction. The building's owners claimed days ago they 'have been cooperating with displaced families who forcibly entered the building on September 27,' and said the families were treated well. Interactions between the displaced and the local communities hosting them across Lebanon are fraught with challenges. While some found refuge with friends or relatives in safer towns and villages during the war, many did not. Numerous refugees are now sleeping in tents on the streets of Beirut, as evidenced by recent videos and photos from the city. On October 9, reports emerged of clashes between those displaced and security forces in Beirut's Ain Al Mraiseh, a coastal neighborhood in the city's north, when authorities attempted to dismantle the tents of those displaced. Addressing the war and the displacement crisis, Prime Minister Najib Mikati told Al Arabiya network, 'I hope that sectarian conflict does not arise as a consequence of the displacement.'

Harvey Weinstein has chronic myeloid leukemia	Former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein has chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), NBC News reported on Monday, citing sources. Weinstein is currently undergoing treatment for CML, a type of bone marrow cancer, while in prison at Rikers Island in New York to face trial on rape charges, according to the NBC report. Craig Rothfeld, Weinstein's legal health care representative, declined comment when asked by Reuters on the status of his health, citing respect for Weinstein's privacy. Weinstein, 72, has been beset with health problems, his lawyers had earlier said. He was rushed to the hospital from Rikers Island jail in September to undergo heart surgery. Weinstein, who has denied having any non-consensual sexual encounters with anyone, was found guilty on rape charges in February 2020 in a case that provided impetus for the #MeToo movement. The New York Court of Appeals threw out the conviction in April, finding Weinstein did not get a fair trial because a judge improperly allowed testimony by accusers he was not formally charged with assaulting. He is in prison awaiting a retrial. Weinstein suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure, spinal stenosis, fluid in his heart and lungs, his representatives have previously said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjdbjsvgyl	2024-10-21T21:34:26-07:00

Death penalty for spying? A look at how Israel deals with traitor...	The uncovering of a serious espionage case linked to Iran has sparked debates over the appropriate punishment for spies, with some lawmakers urging the consideration of capital punishment The expected indictment against the Israelis at the center of the serious espionage case for Iran that was revealed on Monday could be severe according to the police, mainly due to the long period during which the seven suspects allegedly operated on behalf of Tehran, reaching two years. The indictment is set to be filed on Friday, though charges against the suspects have already been determined. In the past, the most serious espionage charges were brought against Israeli atomic technician Mordechai Vanunu, who leaked information and photos from the nuclear reactor in Dimona. He was charged with severe espionage charges and even treason, convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison. Israel's Penal Code divides espionage charges into five different crimes, each with distinct characteristics, severity and penalties. The serious crimes of espionage and passing information to the enemy can lead to prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment. For instance, former Israeli minister Gonen Segev was charged with espionage for Iran and convicted of espionage, but not treason, resulting in an 11-year prison sentence. Amir Makhoul, who spied for Hezbollah, was similarly sentenced to nine years in prison in 2011. Journalist Anat Kamm was convicted of espionage and unauthorized disclosure of classified information, receiving a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence. The significant differences in sentencing stem from the law's clear distinction between someone who spied and gathered security information and someone who did so without passing the information to the enemy. In Kamm's case, she provided the information to Haaretz journalist Uri Blau. The treason offense, which could be linked to this case as it was for Vanunu, comprises seven serious charges, with the most severe ones carrying the possibility of the death penalty. However, these offenses are not expected to be included in the current indictment. Meanwhile, lawmakers have started calling for harsh punitive measures against the suspects, including the death penalty. 'The phenomenon of traitors who harm Israel's security for monetary gain, while we're fighting for our future, requires the use of the harshest measures, including a death penalty law,' Culture and Sports Miki Zohar wrote on his X account (formerly Twitter). 'This is the only way we can create a clear deterrent to prevent similar cases.' Interior Minister Moshe Arbel instructed the advisory committee to consider revoking the citizenship of the Israelis suspected of espionage for Iran. 'The State of Israel, as a nation that values life, will act alongside stricter enforcement against breaches of trust, to expel and denounce those who act against it,' he said. 'This is how we should act, and God willing, this is how we will proceed.'

The last person I'd suspect,' shocked neighbors say after Irania...	Haifa residents in shock after 2 neighbors, including alleged spy ring leader, arrested; officials call for revoking citizenship and imposing financial sanctions on those involved Residents of Haifa expressed disbelief upon learning that seven Azerbaijani immigrants living among them have been accused of espionage, allegedly working for Iranian intelligence. Three of the suspects, who reportedly photographed Israeli military bases targeted in Iran's ballistic missile attack earlier this month, were reportedly caught in southern Israel trailing a senior Israeli official and his son, whom they allegedly planned to assassinate. One of the suspects, Vyacheslav (Slava) Gushchin, had lived on a quiet street in Carmel. 'He lived here alone for about two years. He drank a lot of beer, smoked and worked at car wash centers. He barely had money for food,' said a neighbor from the floor above. 'He told us his wife lived in Belarus. He said she came for a short visit and was deported, and he spent a lot on lawyers to bring her back. He barely had money to live on; it's inconceivable he was involved in espionage. He didn't always pay rent on time either. 'About a month ago, he was arrested for getting into a fight with a local business owner. We haven’t seen him since, and now this affair has become known. It's unbelievable our neighbor for the past two years was involved in espionage against the state.' The convenience store owner who clashed with him said, 'About a month ago, he came here drunk. I told him to go home because he was scaring the customers. There was a scuffle, and then the police arrested him. He was spying? God, he’s the last person I'd suspect to be a spy. I'm shocked.' Another suspect, Aziz Nisanov, believed to be the cell leader, lived on the third floor of a low-income housing apartment with his son Yigal Nisan, who is also in custody for his alleged involvement with the spy ring. 'About two weeks ago, the police came here, broke into the apartment, there was a big mess, they searched all the rooms. I didn’t understand what was happening, and since then I haven’t seen Aziz and his son,' a neighbor told Ynet. Israeli security agency Shin Bet revealed the severity of the case, highlighting how the suspects had carried out intelligence missions for over two years. The information they gathered allegedly posed a significant risk to national security, with the possibility of facilitating missile attacks on Israel. 'The key to confronting this is first and foremost severe punishment that will deter. People need to understand this is treason, a breach of national security, serving the enemy during wartime,' Shin Bet officials said, suggesting administrative and economic sanctions against Israeli citizens cooperating with Iran—including revoking citizenship, confiscating funds and property. Interior Minister Moshe Arbel directed his ministry’s advisory committee to examine the possibility of revoking the citizenship of the seven suspects. 'The State of Israel, as a nation that cherishes life, will intensify enforcement against acts of treason and will also expel and condemn those who act against it,' Arbel said. 'This is the proper course of action, and with God's help, we will follow through.' Security officials noted that public awareness of Iran's intelligence-gathering efforts has grown recently following a series of much-publicized arrests of suspects linked to Tehran. 'Publications on the subject help. People understand more, suspect and report,' they said. Authorities urged the public to follow safety guidelines, including avoiding suspicious links, not corresponding with unknown individuals and ignoring unfamiliar emails. The suspects, all residents of Haifa and northern Israel, include Aziz Nisanov, his son Yigal Nisan, Vyacheslav (Slava) Gushchin, Alexander Sidikov, Yevgeny Ioffe, and two minors whose names cannot be disclosed. Prosecutors are expected to file indictments against them in Haifa District Court on Friday, charging them with serious security offenses. The group is accused of photographing and collecting intelligence on sensitive military sites, including Air Force bases in Nevatim and Ramat David, the government bunker in Tel Aviv, Iron Dome installations, the Hadera power station and other critical infrastructure. They allegedly passed this information to Iranian handlers, who provided them with maps of strategic sites, including the Golani Brigade training base, where four soldiers were killed in a Hezbollah drone strike last week. According to Shin Bet, the suspects conducted espionage missions for over two years under the guidance of two Iranian agents, known as 'Alkhan' and 'Orkhan.' They were aware that the intelligence they provided could aid Iran in targeting Israel, potentially through missile attacks. The suspects were arrested during a photography mission in southern Israel, where three of them were apprehended in the act. Police Chief Superintendent Yaron Binyamin said that the suspects carried out approximately 600 missions over two years. These included gathering intelligence on sensitive sites, military bases and potential human targets, all in service of Iran’s objectives. The suspects’ contact with Iran was through a Turkish national, who acted as a mediator. 'He received the materials from the Iranians and delivered them to Israel. He was involved in espionage cases made public in recent months,' Binyamin said. Additional arrests related to this case have been made in Turkey and Azerbaijan. This intermediary is also linked to Moti Maman, a 72-year-old man from Ashkelon, who was charged last month with contacting a foreign agent. Maman had been recruited by Iran to assist in planning the assassination of senior Israeli officials, including the prime minister, defense minister and Shin Bet chief.

IDF reveals Hezbollah cash bunker beneath Beirut hospital, housin...	Following airstrikes targeting terror group's financial network, army unveils secret money bunker, located underneath Al-Sahel Hospital in heart of Lebanese capital; 'Funds stored here could have been used to rebuild Lebanon, but instead, they are used to rebuild Hezbollah' Following a night of airstrikes targeting Hezbollah's financial network, the IDF unveiled Monday evening a massive underground bunker located beneath a main Beirut hospital, which serves as a key financial facility for the terrorist group. In a press briefing, chief military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari presented a 3D illustration of the underground bunker, located beneath the Al-Sahel Hospital in Beirut, which serves as a central storage site for Hezbollah’s finances. The facility, reportedly used by the group's leader Hassan Nasrallah who had been assassinated in an Israeli airstrike in late September, is alleged to contain more than half a billion dollars in cash and gold. 'Lebanon has been mired in an economic crisis in recent years, and Hezbollah has exploited this to strengthen its grip on the country,' Hagari said. 'The facilities we targeted belong to Hezbollah and are disguised as civilian sites, but their sole purpose is to bolster the organization’s terror capabilities. Hezbollah has effectively created a state within a state.' Hagari revealed that the bunker, located at 7 Daram Street in Beirut, had been under Israeli surveillance for years. 'This bunker, deliberately constructed beneath a hospital, houses at least $500 million in cash and gold. The funds stored here could have been used to rebuild Lebanon, but instead, they are used to rebuild Hezbollah,' he said. He also issued a warning: 'Our aircraft continue to monitor the site, and we will keep tracking it. We call on Lebanese citizens, the Lebanese government and international organizations—do not allow Hezbollah to store money beneath hospitals.' Hagari also reported that the Israeli Air Force struck over 20 targets overnight, most of them in Beirut's Dahieh district, a Hezbollah stronghold. One of the key targets was an underground financial warehouse used by the Al-Qard al-Hassan association, a financial institution affiliated with Hezbollah. Hagari confirmed that the facility held tens of millions of dollars in cash and gold, earmarked to fund the group's operations. Hagari further outlined how Iran funds Hezbollah through three primary channels. First, oil and money are transferred from Iran to Syria, where the oil is sold, and the proceeds are funneled to Hezbollah through Unit 4400, a Hezbollah financial transfer unit. This method generates tens of millions of dollars. Second, Iran flies cash to Lebanon under diplomatic cover, with proceeds from its Quds Force’s independent oil sales delivered directly to the Iranian Embassy in Beirut and then to Hezbollah. The third method, according to Hagari, involves promoting economic ventures backed by Iran, including gas exports to Syria and the establishment of factories in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Turkey. 'This network was managed by Mohammad Jaafar Kassir, the commander of Hezbollah's Unit 4400, who we eliminated in Beirut earlier this month. A few hours ago, we also neutralized his successor in Syria,' Hagari confirmed, referencing recent reports of a drone strike on a vehicle near a Damascus hotel.

The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear a bid by Michael Cohen to revive a lawsuit accusing his former boss Donald Trump and various former federal officials of returning him to prison in 2020 in retaliation for penning a book critical of Trump, who was president at the time. Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and fixer, had appealed a lower court's dismissal of his suit, which sought monetary damages from Trump, former U.S. Attorney General William Barr, federal prison officials and the federal government. Cohen's suit accused them of violating his rights under the U.S. Constitution by restricting his free speech and subjecting him to an illegal seizure and cruel and unusual punishment. Cohen's lawyer Jon-Michael Dougherty said the Supreme Court's decision 'signals a dangerous moment in American democracy.' 'In denying Michael Cohen's petition, the Supreme Court has stated that the courts will not provide any deterrent for an executive intent on incarcerating its critics in retaliation for their speech,' Dougherty said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1n0szvxkg	2024-10-21T09:48:51-07:00	
Inside Hezbollah's financial network: Iran, banks and smuggling o...	While Tehran continues to supply its main proxy with funds, the terror group has turned to criminal and civilian bodies to continue to finance its fight against Israel The Hezbollah terrorist organization receives funding in various ways, both overt and covert. Iran, Hezbollah's main patron, plays a significant role in financing the terror group. According to reports, Iran delivers hundreds of thousands of dollars to Hezbollah annually and also supplies it with weapons. Hezbollah, however, doesn't rely solely on Tehran. The organization has realized the need to diversify its funding sources for various reasons, including U.S. sanctions on Iran. It has done so successfully, mainly via money laundering, arms trading, drugs and tobacco. Hezbollah's Qard Al-Hassan banking chain, whose branches were attacked on Sunday, is considered a central financial tool for the organization — but not an exclusive one. Therefore, targeting it won't necessarily eliminate Hezbollah's funding sources. Hezbollah has over the years extended its reach into various sectors in Lebanon, learning from Iran, including finance, energy and construction. It has established connections, increasing both its influence and wealth in the country. Among Hezbollah's financial entities is Bayt al-Mal (House of Money), a financial body functioning like a bank with branches across the country. Another financial body is Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance Support Authority, responsible for fundraising for the organization. Unlike entities that indirectly raise funds and present themselves as 'innocent institutions,' this authority openly promotes campaigns to arm Hezbollah on social media. 'Raise your head to the sky and see what your support has become — a drone,' one of the authority's videos circulated online during the war read. According to Israel’s Alma Research and Education Center head Tal Beeri, Hezbollah also has a financial unit responsible for salaries, money transfers and budgets, with all its financial activities routed via the financial institutions established by the terror group. Hezbollah also profits from drug smuggling operations across the Middle East, mainly involving the drug Captagon, an amphetamine-type stimulant. A few days ago, the U.S. Treasury Department announced new sanctions against Hezbollah’s financial network involved in oil and drug smuggling. Hezbollah collaborates with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to produce and distribute drugs. The Syrian army manufactures Captagon in factories across the country. The Syrian army's Fourth Division, commanded by the president's brother Maher al-Assad, plays a central role in drug production and has even been dubbed the 'Captagon Division.' Iran established a Captagon production line for Hezbollah in the Beqaa Valley region along the Lebanon-Syria border. Hezbollah has tried over the years to deny its connection to the drug's production and smuggling, being careful to ensure that its partners don't take on central roles in transportation and smuggling. Jordan is one of the key countries facing this drug challenge, with ongoing attempts to smuggle drugs into its territory including via drones. Over the years, Hezbollah has also extended its reach into the energy and fuel sectors. Hezbollah's opponents in Lebanon are aware of the organization's pervasive influence and many blame it for the current energy crisis in the country. According to Beeri, Iran’s fuel smuggling pipeline is another way for the organization to earn funds. 'They receive fuel from Iran, it’s smuggled to Hezbollah via Syria and Hezbollah starts trading or selling it.' He added that the terror group also profits from construction companies. 'There are many construction companies that appear to be civilian but are under Jihad al-Bina (Hezbollah’s socio-economic institution). There are construction, engineering and other companies belonging to Hezbollah. You can find something linked to Hezbollah in almost every field, presented as legitimate.' Many companies operating with or under Hezbollah are regularly subject to international sanctions aimed at stopping the delivery of funds to the terrorist organization. Numerous other companies in Lebanon and abroad are part of Hezbollah's financial network, across various sectors. It's hard to tell if Hezbollah could survive economically without Iran's support, relying solely on the complex financial network it has developed over the years. The organization also receives donations from communities abroad, with charity funds found in mosques around the world designated for donations to Hezbollah. 'Hezbollah is involved in almost every criminal activity worldwide, even luxury car smuggling. They have connections with criminal syndicates across the work, wherever a Shia community is found. Crime serves them not only for terrorism but also economically. It's a global operation.,' he added.

Ex-UN soldier exposes Hezbollah dominance in southern Lebanon, hi...	Michael, a Danish soldier who served in Lebanon a decade ago, describes UN's inability to act against Hezbollah, says 'reported daily violations of Resolution 1701, but nothing happened' A former Danish UN soldier revealed in an interview that Hezbollah maintained tight control over areas in southern Lebanon where UN personnel operated, further substantiating Israeli claims that the UN has failed to prevent Hezbollah's military buildup and enforce Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Lebanon War. Michael, a retired Danish soldier who served with the UN in southern Lebanon, told the Danish newspaper BT that UN personnel were 'completely dependent on Hezbollah' and had limited freedom of movement. 'In some areas, we couldn’t even take photos,' Michael said, referring to restrictions imposed by Hezbollah on UN forces. Michael, who served with the UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) a decade ago, said Hezbollah's influence over UN activities was already pervasive at that time. He recounted that UN personnel were often blocked by Hezbollah operatives when they attempted to access suspected areas of terrorist activity. 'They simply blocked the road. They weren’t openly armed, but it was clear they were Hezbollah fighters,' he said. He also noted that UN peacekeepers were prohibited from documenting what they observed. 'It wasn’t allowed to take videos or pictures. If we did, locals could confiscate our cameras. This happened to some of my colleagues,' Michael added. When patrolling near the Israel-Lebanon border, Michael said UN forces were instructed to maintain a distance from Hezbollah operatives and avoid confrontation. 'We often saw 'civilians' near Israeli military facilities taking pictures. When that happened, we pulled back and watched from a distance, as we were instructed to do,' he explained. 'I once threw an interpreter out of my car for praising Nasrallah' Michael told the Danish newspaper that fear of the terrorist group was widespread. 'Civilians who didn’t support Hezbollah, especially Christians, were afraid to speak against it,' he said. He noted, however, that there was some cooperation between Shiite Muslims and UN personnel, with some interpreters affiliated with Hezbollah. 'I once threw one out of my car for praising Hassan Nasrallah. I refused to listen to that,' he said. The ex-soldier described a 'complete lack' of enforcement against repeated violations of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which prohibits armed groups south of the Litani River except for the Lebanese army. He expressed frustration over the lack of consequences for Hezbollah’s actions. 'We reported daily violations of Resolution 1701, especially restrictions on our movement. We were instructed to report every violation, but nothing happened. We never heard back, and no action was taken. It was incredibly frustrating,' Michael explained, adding that this confirmed his experiences in other UN deployments. 'The UN is ineffective.' Despite this, Michael emphasized that he and his fellow UN personnel believed in their mission. 'We had a reason to be there, even if some of us had to come to terms with the fact that we couldn’t do anything,' he said. He also noted that some UN observers in southern Lebanon held strong anti-Israel views. 'I remember one in particular, an Irishman,' he added. Michael expressed surprise at recent Israeli discoveries of Hezbollah tunnels and underground infrastructure, which are now being destroyed by the IDF near the border villages. According to the BT report, these tunnels are located near UNIFIL bases. 'We never saw or heard any digging while we were there—I would never have hidden that. But there were several civilian homes and even so-called 'chicken farms' near the Blue Line when I was there, and of course, we weren’t allowed to inspect them,' he said, referring to a demarcation line dividing Lebanon from Israel. Hezbollah's hostages The former soldier revealed that during his service, Israeli forces had shown a precise understanding of Hezbollah's positions along the border. 'We often visited the Israeli side of the border to get their perspective, and they could accurately pinpoint Hezbollah's locations on the other side,' Michael said. Michael's testimony comes amid growing tensions between Israel and UNIFIL. Israel has requested that UNIFIL withdraw its positions five kilometers (three miles) north of the border, citing ongoing clashes with Hezbollah. Despite the escalating violence, UNIFIL has refused to relocate, a stance Israel argues puts the peacekeepers at risk and makes them 'human shields' for Hezbollah, which operates near their bases. The UN peacekeepers have been caught in the crossfire in recent weeks, leading to international condemnation and concern from Israel’s allies, including Italy. Israel is worried about the potential loss of international support for its military operations. Foreign Minister Israel Katz clarified Israel's position last week, saying, 'Israel places great importance on UNIFIL's mission and has no intention of harming the organization or its personnel. We view UNIFIL as crucial in the 'day after' scenario following the war with Hezbollah.' Katz accused Hezbollah of using UNIFIL as cover, saying, 'The terrorist group deliberately fires at Israeli forces near UNIFIL positions to provoke conflict. We will continue to make every effort to avoid harming UNIFIL, in full coordination with its commanders and in accordance with international law.' Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts continue to reach a political solution to the northern front, as Hezbollah signals readiness for a cease-fire, separate from the ongoing war in Gaza. U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut for talks, with Western diplomats urging Israel to seize the opportunity for a settlement, including a possible expansion of UNIFIL's mandate. 'We now understand that UNIFIL's mandate was flawed, and we need to explore either an expanded or a different mandate,' a senior Western diplomat told Ynet.

Putin, vote scandal and the Israeli link: Moldova's EU referendum...	President Maia Sandu’s push for Moldova to join EU sparks accusations of vote-buying linked to Israeli businessman allegedly backing Russia; despite controversy, initial results show narrow victory for country's EU membership bid Moldova is swaying between Russia and the EU on Monday following the announcement of the results of a referendum held on Sunday, where citizens were asked to vote for or against President Maia Sandu's plan to join the European Union. Overnight results initially indicated a sensational lead for the anti-EU camp, with 57% of the vote. By midday, however, after 99.41% of the votes had been counted, authorities announced that the pro-EU camp had narrowly won with 50.39% in favor compared to 49.61% against. Regardless, the result was disappointing for Sandu. The vote in Moldova — a country of 2.6 million people that was once part of the Soviet Union but has been increasingly looking to Western Europe, especially since Russia's invasion of Ukraine — was marked by significant tension. The pro-European President Sandu accused Russia of 'unprecedented' interference in Moldova's internal affairs, claiming an attempt to disrupt the vote, distance Chisinau from the West and keep it within Russia's sphere of influence. Moldovan police conducted around 350 raids in recent months, arresting hundreds suspected of intending to interfere in the vote on Russia's behalf. The allegations included not only spreading misinformation and pro-Russian propaganda but also 'buying' approximately 300,000 votes — a quarter of the expected total electorate — in a bid to sway the results in favor of the anti-EU camp. The pro-Russian campaign was reportedly led by Israeli businessman Ilan Shor, who fled to Moscow after being accused in Moldova of attempting to destabilize the country on behalf of the Kremlin and was convicted on corruption charges. Shor headed a pro-Russian party in Moldova that was declared unconstitutional after supporting protests against Sandu's government last year, allegedly aiming to overthrow her and install a pro-Russian administration. The 37-year-old Shor is also subject to U.S. sanctions. Shor mocked Sandu on social media over her supposed 'defeat' and 'miserable failure,' when initial results of the referendum were reported on. Even as Sandu has narrowly secured victory in the referendum, it's hard to view it as a success. The 52-year-old president, a former World Bank economist who strongly supports joining the European Union, initiated the referendum to gain public credit for her policy and hoped for a resounding win. Not only was the victory achieved by a very slim margin but it was carried via an unusually high voter turnout among Moldovan citizens living abroad, a population that largely supports EU membership. This fact is likely to undermine Sandu's leadership within Moldova and the pro-European image she and her supporters have tried to project internationally. Moldova began its EU accession process this past June and according to Sandu's plan aims to complete it by 2030. The emerging results are a major disappointment not only for Sandu but also for Brussels, which, amid what appears to be Georgia's return to closer ties with Russia, hoped at least to draw Moldova into its sphere of influence in the geopolitical struggle against Russia. In a speech delivered early on Monday, Sandu said there was 'clear evidence' that criminal organizations collaborated with foreign entities hostile to Moldova's interests, channeling tens of millions of euros into the process in an attempt to distort the vote and buy hundreds of thousands of votes. She also claimed it was an unprecedented scale of fraud and vowed not to back down. 'Their objective was to undermine a democratic process. Their intention was to spread fear and panic in society... We are waiting for the final results, and we will respond with firm decisions.' The referendum took place alongside Moldova's presidential elections and the results published overnight indicate Sandu is also facing challenges in her political career. While she garnered 42% of the votes, she didn't secure the 50% needed to win in the first round, forcing her into a second round on November 3 where she will face former Attorney General Alexandr Stoianoglo who won 26% of voters. Stoianoglo, who has the backing of pro-Russian socialists, could rally support from other candidates' supporters, posing a threat to Sandu's presidency. He claims that if he comes to power, he'll pursue a 'balanced' policy, maintaining ties with all parties — the European Union, the U.S. and Russia.

Military shoots down 5 Hezbollah drones over Mediterranean in largest drone attack in weeks, briefly disrupting flights at Ben Gurion Airport; interception follows heavy rocket fire on northern Israel, with no reported casualties In the largest drone attack in weeks, the IDF announced on Monday afternoon that Air Force helicopters and fighter jets intercepted five drones over the Mediterranean Sea. According to the military, the drones were intercepted before entering Israeli airspace. Following the launch of Hezbollah's drone swarm from Lebanon, departures from Ben Gurion Airport were briefly halted but resumed within 15 minutes. The IDF confirmed there was 'no security threat at the airport.' Around 50,000 passengers are expected to pass through the airport on Monday, including 24,200 on departing flights. Hezbollah has launched multiple drone swarms since the start of the war, though incidents involving five or more aircraft have been rare. This latest drone barrage followed a heavy rocket attack on Kiryat Shmona and the Galilee Panhandle, during which 25 rockets were fired. Sirens also sounded in Beit She’an, Tiberias, Nof HaGalil and dozens of other communities. Tiberias officials reported the interception of two rockets, with no casualties or property damage. A crater was discovered near the Gilboa region’s Moshav Moledet following a rocket strike.

Gaza settlements will happen, sooner or later, Smotrich declares	Finance minister makes remarks during event near Gaza border, titled 'Practical Preparations for Settling Gaza,' attended by Likud Knesset members and ministers Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Monday that Jewish settlements in Gaza are 'inevitable' and that he has believed since the 2005 disengagement from the Palestinian enclave that Israel would eventually need to retake the territory. 'It's clear to me that there will eventually be Jewish settlements in Gaza,' Smotrich remarked at a Nachal' movement event, held on the Gaza border under the title 'Practical Preparations for Settling Gaza.' The event, which featured workshops on 'settlement preparation' near the border, was attended by several coalition members, including Knesset members from the ruling Likud Party and ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir, May Golan and Smotrich himself. Nachala movement leader Daniella Weiss announced that the movement had 'ordered and paid for 40 buildings' intended for future settlements in Gaza. 'Representatives from 700 families are here, all committed to settling Gaza,' She said. 'The only solution is to eliminate Hamas, and those wishing for a normal life should move abroad.' Opposition leader Yair Lapid condemned the event, accusing Smotrich's Religious Zionist Party of hijacking Likud and pushing for endless conflict. 'This event endangers the IDF and Israel's foreign policy, and there’s no prime minister to stop it,' he said. The event invitation, issued with the Likud logo, read: 'Preparing for settlement in Gaza with Likud's settlement cores,' and attendees were expected to declare, 'Gaza is ours. Forever!'

Mass exodus from Jabaliya: Thousands of Gazans flee for 3rd strai...	Civilians evacuate as Israeli forces escalate operations, targeting Hamas infrastructure and surrounding key shelters; military actions, aimed at separating terrorists from civilians, heighten humanitarian concerns and draw growing international scrutiny For the third consecutive day, images surfaced on Monday showing civilians evacuating en masse from Jabaliya, a northern Gaza Strip area where the IDF has been conducting intensive raids for the past three weeks. Following the elimination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who imposed a reign of terror in the area, IDF Arabic spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee said, 'The fear barrier of [Yahya] Sinwar has cracked,' attributing the civilian exodus to the breakdown of Hamas' control. In the last 24 hours, the IDF’s 162nd Division reported destroying key terrorist infrastructure and tunnel shafts in Jabaliya. Soldiers from the 401st Brigade, whose commander Col. Ehsan Daxa was killed in Jabaliya on Sunday, neutralized several terrorists through tank fire, close combat and air force strikes. Gazans have claimed that IDF forces intensified their operations, surrounding schools that had been sheltering displaced civilians. Residents also reported that Israeli forces ordered the evacuation of civilians from Jabaliya, including areas around hospitals, which medical teams say are struggling under the pressure of the ongoing raids. Now in its third week, the 162nd Division's incursion into Jabaliya continues. Previous IDF operations in the area occurred in November, December and May, but unlike earlier efforts, the current offensive faces the challenge of evacuating civilians from a densely populated city where Hamas operatives have rebuilt significant military capabilities. According to IDF assessments, the Jabaliya raid is expected to last several more weeks, if not months. Hundreds of terrorists have been eliminated since the operation began, and large weapons caches and re-dug tunnels used by Hamas have been discovered. Raed, a resident of Jabaliya, expressed his anguish to Reuters, saying, 'We face death from bombs, hunger and thirst. Jabaliya is being erased, and there are no witnesses to the crime here. The world averts its gaze.' Israeli officials, however, emphasized that the evacuations are aimed at separating Hamas terrorists from civilians and rejected claims that the operation is part of a broader plan to displace residents from Jabaliya or the northern Gaza Strip.

Israel strikes Hezbollah's banking arm, IDF says attacks will con...	Air Force including branches of Hezbollah's financial arm, the Al-Qard al-Hassan Association; terror group vows the depositors won't lose any money despite Israeli strikes Israeli Air Force jets launched a series of overnight and early morning strikes in Lebanon, targeting dozens of Hezbollah command posts and locations where funds used for terror operations were stored. These funds were funneled through Hezbollah's financial arm, the Al-Qard al-Hassan Association, according to the military. The strikes, which began Sunday night, are expected to continue throughout Monday. The Lebanese outlet Al-Jadeed reported that Israeli strikes hit western Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley, while Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen claimed three people were killed in a drone strike on a residential building in Baalbek. Additional strikes were reported in areas including Baddnayel and southern Lebanon. Hezbollah vowed that depositors with Al-Qard Al-Hassan would not lose any money despite the Israeli strikes. Rocket fire from Lebanon also persisted, with sirens sounding in the towns of Carmiel and the Ma'alot area in Israel's Western Galilee. In his statement, the IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari warned civilians to avoid Hezbollah-affiliated sites. 'Anyone near locations used to fund Hezbollah’s terror operations should distance themselves immediately,'he said shortly before stikes on the Dahieh began. According to Saudi-based Al-Hadath, there was a noticeable movement of people fleeing the area following the Israeli warning. Sky News Arabia reported that a hospital in Baalbek was evacuated due to its proximity to an Al-Qard Al-Hassan facility. The IDF was escalating airstrikes against Hezbollah's financial networks, particularly in Dahieh, aiming to disrupt the terror group’s cash flow. According to the IDF, Hezbollah uses millions of dollars funneled from Iran to pay its members and purchase weapons. The cash, often converted from Iranian rials to U.S. dollars in Syria, enters Lebanon in suitcases, with as much as $1 billion circulating each year. The IDF said that Hezbollah has become Lebanon’s wealthiest employer amidst the country's ongoing economic crisis. The average Hezbollah operative earns around $500 a month, and the group operates 31 branches of its financial institution, Al-Qard Al-Hassan, which holds assets in cash and gold across Lebanon. The IDF indicated that Hezbollah’s financial power structure is also a prime target of the strikes. 'This will shake Hezbollah’s financial foundation, making it harder for the group to maintain stability for its members and workers,' the IDF said. 'Hezbollah has embedded its financial operations within schools and clinics, but many of these buildings will be destroyed as part of our broader strategy to cripple the organization.'

A Danish citizen who served in UNTSO (United Nations Truce Supervision Organization) in southern Lebanon, testified about the conduct of UN bodies vis-à-vis Hezbollah, saying in an interview for the Danish newspaper BT that 'we were completely dependent on Hezbollah, our freedom of movement was limited.' According to him, when the UN personnel tried to reach the places where Hezbollah was suspected to be operating, they were arrested: 'They were aggressive and blocked the way. They didn't want us to see what they were doing.' He also testified that they were instructed to keep their distance from Hezbollah terrorists, and added that there was a 'total lack' of the ability to act against many violations of Resolution 1701. 'We reported on a daily basis, nothing happened. The UN is incompetent.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syfbu3qeje	2024-10-21T04:31:27-07:00

Ministers demand strong response to Iran	In an hours-long meeting, cabinet members accuse the military of a lax response to the drone strike on Netanyahu's home; security officials say the IDF can only take action instructed by the government Ministers in Israel's security cabinet voiced criticism over Israel's lack of response to Iran's aggressions including the drone attack that targeted the private residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday. In an hours-long cabinet meeting on Sunday, the ministers accused the military of failing to take appropriate action in response to the attack. Security officials said in response that the IDF can only take action after the government decides what Israel's response should be. The question of when and how Israel should respond to Iran's ballistic missile attack has not been brought before the security cabinet until now and would likely only be discussed after Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and senior security officials finalize the plan. Gallant was supposed to travel to Washington last week, to discuss and coordinate an Israeli strike on Iran with his counterpart but was prevented from leaving by Netanyahu who said that his trip can only take place after there was a cabinet vote authorizing the prime minister and the defense minister to decide on a plan. During Sunday's meeting, ministers discussed the consequences of the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and if it could be leveraged to reach a cease-fire and hostage release deal. The ministers expressed their hope that Qatar, a mediator in talks with Hamas could pressure the terror group to agree to Israel's terms. they also heard a briefing about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the American threat of withholding arms to Israel if aid is not delivered in sufficient amounts. In a letter sent earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin threatened to invoke a national security memorandum issued in March which set conditions for continued U.S. military support to Israel, including allowing unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid. Despite recent claims by Israel that it was not preventing aid, including the entry of 30 trucks of food into northern Gaza on Monday, the U.S. remains concerned about restrictions.

I shouted I know who it is,'' the doctor who identified Yahya Si...	Warning, this article contains graphic content: Dr. Assi Sharon-Sagi, an oral and facial reconstruction specialist at Hadassah Medical Center and a volunteer with the police forensic identification unit, says she was preparing for the day she would identify the terrorist leader Dr. Assi Sharon-Sagi’s phone rang while she was at home. In addition to her regular role as an oral and facial reconstruction specialist at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, she has volunteered for years with the dental forensic identification unit. Since the start of the war, Dr. Sharon has been tasked with identifying victims of the Hamas atrocities and fallen soldiers. That urgent call brought monumental news—Dr. Sharon was the first to confirm with a high degree of certainty that the terrorist who was killed by IDF forces in Gaza last week, was the notorious Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. His body was examined and identified at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Abu Kabir before being stored at a secret location. 'Every so often, they send me a photo and ask if I have anything to say about it or if there’s something important to note. It happens quite often,' Dr. Sharon says. 'That’s exactly what happened on Thursday last week. I was at home, received a call and some pictures, and the second I saw them, I knew who I was looking at.' Did you recognize him right away? 'Yes. While it does require sitting down, checking, and going over every detail to write an official report, I knew immediately from the first glance. I was thrilled. I hopped up and shouted, 'I know who this is!'' Dr. Sharon had been preparing for this moment for months. 'In recent months, I decided I wanted to gather information in case we received Sinwar for identification,' she shared. 'With the help of the police forensic unit and the Israel Prison Service (from Sinwar’s time as a prisoner), we collected data. At first, it was general information, numbers, and so on, but then we moved on to building a detailed file by gathering images from social media.' 'We call this an 'anti-mortem' file—a file built before death, containing all relevant information, whether it’s photos, CT scans, or other features not directly related to teeth but visible in the face and ears. Dr. Ayala Groswald-Meiri put it all together.' 'Fortunately, in Sinwar’s case, his teeth are extremely distinctive, and they appear in all the pictures. Later, we obtained information from Soroka Medical Center, where Sinwar underwent brain surgery in 2005. We retrieved three of his CT scans from the hospital. We kept this file, and every expert in the unit was familiar with its details and images. So, when I first saw the picture, I knew immediately what I was looking at.' According to Dr. Sharon, dental identification is one of three scientific methods used by the forensic unit to identify bodies. 'We rely on one of three things—or a combination of them: dental X-rays, dental treatments, or morphology—the shape of the teeth, jaw structure, and sinuses,' she explained. 'In Sinwar’s case, his front and side morphology are very distinctive—he has missing teeth and gaps between them. The moment I saw the picture, I could make the comparison. After that, we sat down and wrote up all the details to complete the identification report.' Dr. Sharon has been volunteering with the unit since 2010 and has been involved in many tragic events that claimed the lives of Israelis. 'The first one I worked on was the Carmel fire disaster. Another was the Nahal Tzafit flood disaster, which was the first time I had to identify such young and beautiful people,' she recalled. 'Over the years, there have been major car accidents and other events, but the biggest tragedy came on October 7, with the massacre of the young people at the Nova music festival.' 'We arrived on the night of October 7, and we started identification on October 8, working around the clock—24 hours a day, seven days a week. It went on like that for a long time, and later it became more focused operations. Throughout all these months, we’ve been receiving either information or bodies, conducting examinations, and working to identify or rule out victims, all in the effort to locate the hostages.' Does identifying Sinwar bring any sense of closure? 'I’m not sure yet if I feel a sense of closure because I’m waiting for something else—something happy. I’m waiting for the hostages. But I can say that it’s satisfying to have identified the man who murdered so many of the people I’ve identified during this time. It’s important for me to say that identification work is a team effort. Everyone contributes, building one layer on top of another, so we can create organized files and complete the identification process. That’s what allowed us to make this quick identification.' 'I wasn’t alone in this identification,' she added. 'Two other specialists were with me: Dr. Revital Hebert, who led the unit for ten years, and Dr. Tzipi Kahana, a forensic anthropologist. She also contributed additional details that weren’t included in the official report, which is based on dental identification, but they added to the certainty of our forensic findings.' This kind of work over such a long period must take a mental toll. 'I can’t fully describe the psychological difficulties that this role demands of us. But I can say that the best places for me to be, and the people who are easiest for me to talk to, are those who work alongside me in the unit. When I’m with them, I feel calm, and everything is fine. But when I’m in my regular job at hospitals and clinics, it’s much harder for me. It feels like such a stark contrast to the identification work. I always feel like I’m in the wrong place, like I should be helping with the identification work. But my real life is my job as a dentist and a mentor to residents.' Meanwhile, as the war in Gaza and the north continues, there’s only one thing she’s hoping for. 'I just hope as many hostages as possible return alive, so I can take them off my lists because they’ll come back on their own two feet. I’ll stay in this role and do this work as long as it’s needed from me and the unit. We’ll do everything we can to bring the murdered hostages back to their families.'

Rabbi sues Hamas, PA after wife, daughters murdered in attack	Leo Dee demands NIS 50 million in compensation after the shooting attack claiming the Palestinian Authority supports terrorism and the murder was committed by members of the Hamas terror group Rabbi Leo Dee and his family filed a lawsuit in the Jerusalem District Court against the Palestinian Authority and the Hamas terror organization, for the murder Rabbi Leo Dee's wife, Lucy, 48, and their two daughters, the late Maia-Esther, 20, and the late Rina-Miriam, 15, in a shooting attack about 18 months ago in the Jordan Valley. The lawsuit, which was filed a few days ago through the lawyers of the Shurat Hadin advocacy group organization, amounts to NIS 50 million. According to the Shurat Hadin organization, in accordance with the recent Compensation for Victims of Hostile Action Act, the court may award compensation five times as much as previously given. The lawsuit claims the Palestinian Authority 'supports terrorism' because the PA pays imprisoned terrorists, and therefore bears responsibility for the triple murder, carried out by Hamas terrorists. 'On Passover a year and a half ago, my wife Lucy and my daughters Rina and Maia were murdered by despicable terrorists. Since then our lives have changed beyond recognition,' said Rabbi Dee. 'It is unbelievable that to this day the Palestinian Authority pays rewards to the families of the terrorists, in support of the perpetrators of the damned attack.' 'This lawsuit is our attempt to do some justice, on behalf of Lucy, Maia, and Rina. The lawsuit does nothing to heal our pain or sorrow, but we continue to fight evil wherever he is. We are working at the legal level and hope to be able to damage the rewards and incentives that the terrorists have been receiving from the Palestinian Authority for decades as much as possible.' The new law to compensate victims of terrorism sets a minimum threshold of ten million shekels for the victim's next of kin, and five million shekels for each family member. 'This lawsuit joins a series of lawsuits that we are conducting these days against the Palestinian Authority and the terrorist organizations that it finances, but this time, in light of the new compensation law, we estimate that these will give some peace of mind to the victims of terrorism this time, in light of the amount of funds that will be taken,' said President Shurat Hadin organization, attorney Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, who represents the Dee family. 'This is the time for the victims of terrorism to fight back with all their strength and bring about the economic collapse of the terrorist organizations.'

Turkish cleric accused of staging coup against Erdogan, dies in U...	Fethullah Gulen built a powerful Islamic movement; once an alley of Turkey's president before being branded a traitor he lived in exile; after the failed coup Erdogan arrested at least 77,000 people in a purge and closed down institutions linked to him The U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who built a powerful Islamic movement in Turkey and beyond but spent his later years mired in accusations of orchestrating an attempted coup against Turkish leader Tayyip Erdogan, has died. He was 83. Herkul, a website that publishes Gulen's sermons, said on its X account that Gulen had died on Sunday evening in the U.S. hospital where he was being treated. Gulen was a one-time ally of Erdogan but they fell out spectacularly, and Erdogan held him responsible for the 2016 attempted coup in which rogue soldiers commandeered warplanes, tanks and helicopters. Some 250 people were killed in the bid to seize power. Gulen, who had lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, denied involvement in the putsch. According to its followers, Gulen's movement - known as 'Hizmet' which means 'service' in Turkish - seeks to spread a moderate brand of Islam that promotes Western-style education, free markets and interfaith communication. Since the failed coup, his movement has been systematically dismantled in Turkey and its influence has declined internationally. Known to his supporters as Hodjaefendi, or respected teacher, Gulen was born in a village in the eastern Turkish province of Erzurum in 1941. The son of an imam, or Islamic preacher, he studied the Koran from infancy. In 1959, Gulen was appointed as a mosque imam in the northwestern city of Edirne and began to come to prominence as a preacher in the 1960s in the western province of Izmir, where he set up student dormitories and would go to tea houses to preach. These student houses marked the start of an informal network that would spread over the following decades through education, business, media and state institutions, giving his supporters extensive influence. This influence also spread beyond Turkey's borders to the Turkic republics of Central Asia, the Balkans, Africa and the West through a network of schools. Former Erdogan Ally Gulen had been a close ally of Erdogan and his AK Party, but growing tensions in their relationship exploded in December 2013 when corruption investigations targeting ministers and officials close to Erdogan came to light. Prosecutors and police from Gulen's Hizmet movement were widely believed to be behind the investigations and an arrest warrant was issued for Gulen in 2014, with his movement designated as a terrorist group two years later. Soon after the 2016 coup, Erdogan described Gulen's network as traitors and 'like a cancer', vowing to root them out wherever they are. Hundreds of schools, companies, media outlets and associations linked to him were shut down and assets seized. Gulen condemned the coup attempt. 'As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt,' he said in a statement. In a crackdown after the failed putsch, which the government said targeted Gulen's followers, at least 77,000 people were arrested and 150,000 state workers including teachers, judges and soldiers suspended under emergency rule. Companies and media outlets regarded as linked to Gulen were seized by the state or closed down. The Turkish government said its actions were justified by the gravity of the threat posed to the state by the coup. Gulen also became an isolated figure within Turkey, reviled by Erdogan's supporters and shunned by the opposition which saw his network as having conspired over decades to undermine the secular foundations of the republic. Ankara long sought to have him extradited from the United States. Speaking in his gated compound in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, Gulen said in a 2017 Reuters interview he had no plans to flee the United States to avoid extradition. Even then, he appeared frail, walking with a shuffle and keeping his longtime doctor close at hand. Gulen had traveled to the United States for medical treatment but remained there as he faced a criminal investigation in Turkey.

Sinwar turned down offer of safe passage out of Gaza, report	Hamas leader prepared for his death since Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah's assassination; told mediators 'I’m not under siege, I’m on Palestinian soil' Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas who was killed last week by IDF soldiers in the Tel a-Sultan neighborhood in Rafah, received an offer from Egypt during the war to leave the Gaza Strip and in return allow Cairo to conduct the negotiations for the release of the hostages, but he refused, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. According to the report Sinwar began to prepare for his assassination after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli attack in Dahieh in Beirut. He informed his people that Israel would probably offer concessions after his death to end the war, but said that Hamas in negotiations is in a stronger position. Apart from that, he also advised Hamas to appoint a council to govern and manage the organization after his death. Ynet reported there is not a single definite replacement for Sinwar so far. It is possible that a council will determine Hamas' stance on a hostage deal and facilitate one in the future. On Monday, the political-security cabinet convened for a discussion regarding a hostage deal after Sinwar's death. A senior Israeli official said recently that no substantial progress or dramatic breakthrough is expected in the talks, at least until the possible Israeli attack on Iran and the potential response is not over. Sinwar's replacements are also not expected to make much progress with a deal until they see a development in the regional war. Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, traveled to Cairo on Sunday to meet the new head of Egyptian intelligence, Major General Hassan Mahmoud Rashad who replaced long-serving Abbas Kamel. The two met in an attempt to advance a deal and get the negotiations back on track. Israel and the U.S. were in discussions with the Egyptian and Qatari mediators, trying to understand if it was possible to reach a breakthrough with Hamas. Israel fears Hamas will exact revenge on the hostages, and relayed threats through the intermediaries not harm them. Israel offered free passage and a financial reward to anyone holding hostages, dead or alive, to release them or provide information about their whereabouts. Last Friday, Sinwar's deputy Khalil al-Haya confirmed that Sinwar was killed, in a recorded speech. He said the terror group would not compromise on its demands for the IDF to withdraw from Gaza and the war to end.

US says THAAD anti-missile system is 'in place' in Israel	The U.S. military has rushed its advanced anti-missile system to Israel and it is now 'in place', Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said. THAAD, or the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system is a critical part of the U.S. military's layered air defense systems and adds to Israel's already formidable anti-missile defenses. 'The THAAD system is in place,' Austin said, speaking to reporters before his arrival in Ukraine on Monday. He declined to say whether it was operational, but added: 'We have the ability to put it into operation very quickly and we're on pace with our expectations.' President Joe Biden said the THAAD's deployment, along with about 100 U.S. soldiers, was meant to help defend Israel, which is weighing an expected retaliation against Iran after Tehran fired more than 180 missiles at Israel on Oct 1. The United States has been urging Israel to calibrate its response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear sites and his concerns about a strike on its energy infrastructure. Responding to questions from reporters, Biden said last week he had a good understanding of when and how Israel would attack Iran. But he also said he saw an opportunity to end the two enemies' back-and-forth strikes. Austin was cautious. 'It's hard to say exactly what that (Israel's) strike will look like,' Austin told reporters. 'At the end of the day, that's an Israeli decision, and whether or not the Israelis believe it's proportional and how the Iranians perceive it, I mean those may be two different things,' he said 'We're going to do - continue to do - everything we can ... to dial down the tensions and hopefully get both parties to begin to de-escalate. So, we'll see what happens,' he added.

ICC prosecutor accused of sexual harassment, report	Woman working as a secretary in the International Criminal Court said to be brought to tears by Karim Khan's conduct but refuses to file official complaint; internal probe recommends undisclosed measures; Khan denies allegations International Criminal Court (ICC) special prosecutor Karim Khan was accused of sexual harassment by a woman working as his secretary, the Daily Mail reported on Sunday. The ICC launched an internal investigation into the claims after another employee reported to her superiors that the woman 'was so upset she was in tears.' The allegations surfaced two weeks before Khan announced he was seeking arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over their conduct in the war in Gaza. Khan also sought warrants against no slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hamas military wing chief Mohammed Deif. The ICC investigation was conducted by the Independent Oversight Mechanism (IOM) authorized to investigate claims of misconduct in the court but after the accuser refused to confirm or deny the alleged harassment or lodge a formal complaint, the IOM recommended a series of undisclosed measures 'to safeguard everyone's rights,' the Daily Mail said. Khan denied any wrongdoing and said he was a victim of a deliberate smear campaign, adding he and the court were being subjected to a wide range of attacks and threats. 'I absolutely can confirm there is no truth to suggestions of misconduct,' he said. In the IOM annual report that was published on Friday, Kahn's name was not mentioned although the accusations against him were included. According to the report, allegations of his misconduct were made on May 3 and the woman who made them was told she can bring her accusations to an outside body. 'She still refused to file an official complaint,' the report said.

Israel has demanded its IDF forces be allowed to engage in 'active enforcement' to make sure Hezbollah doesn't rearm and rebuild its military infrastructure close to the border, Axios reported, citing an Israeli official. Israel also demanded its air force have freedom of operation in Lebanese air space, the report added. On Sunday the military said it was targeting the Al-Qard al-Hassan association, Hezbollah's banks and most valued financial asset and warned civilians to move away from its branches and avoid harm. The Air Force conducted raids on the bank in Beirut's Dahieh sector, a Hezbollah stronghold on Monday after overnight strikes there, in the Bekaa Valley area and in other parts of Lebanon. The Al-Qard al-Hassan Association, which directly funds Hezbollah's terror activities, including the purchase weapons and payments to operatives in Hezbollah's military wing,' the IDF said. 'The Hezbollah terrorist organization stores billions of dollars in the association's branches, including money that was directly held under the name of the terrorist organization.' U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein was due in Beirut on Monday for talks on ending Israel's war against Hezbollah. According to reports, Israel presented its demands for a cease-fire agreement that would stop the IDF offensive on the terror group. A U.S. official told Axios it was 'highly unlikely' that Lebanon and the international community would agree to Israel's conditions. The White House could not be immediately reached outside regular business hours. The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Nova massacre survivor takes own life	Shirel Golan, is found dead on her 22nd birthday; Her brother blames inadequate state support for post-trauma, calls for government action to prevent similar tragedies amid grief and mourning Shirel Golan was found dead on Sunday after taking her own life. She survived the horrific massacre at the Nova Festival on October 7 and was set to celebrate her 22nd birthday with her parents, with a plan to visit to the Western Wall and the Cave of the Patriarchs. Many well-wishers sent her birthday messages, but she did not respond. Later, she was found in the yard of her home. 'Since she survived, I noticed symptoms of post-trauma. The state did not provide her with the care she needed,' her brother Eyal said. 'On the morning of October 7, after the sirens subsided, I texted our family group, and she replied that everything was okay. My brother and I set up a command center to guide her on where to go. Initially, she got into a car with friends, but at some point, she switched to a police officer's vehicle that rescued her to Kfar Maimon.' He added, 'It later emerged that everyone in the original car was killed, 11 people. It was a ride of death.' Eyal described Shirel's struggles: 'After she survived, I saw signs of post-trauma like avoidance and withdrawal from social interactions. I urged her to seek help, but she said she only received support from the Nova association, not from the state.' He shared that she fell into depression and was hospitalized twice in a psychiatric facility in the town of Pardes Hanna because no official recognized her as a victim of post-trauma from the Nova events. 'The state failed Shirel,' he lamented. He recalled spending time with her during the Sukkot holiday, where she seemed okay. 'I asked how she was, and she said she was fine. I gave her a hug and a kiss, not realizing it would be the last.' Eyal said Shirel left no note. 'We are five siblings, and she was the youngest. The government needs to wake up. If it doesn't, there will be more cases like this. If the state had provided proper care, this wouldn't have happened. I've lost my sister, but I want to raise an outcry so others don't lose their loved ones.' 'The ministry expresses deep sorrow over the untimely death of the Nova survivor and shares the family's and community’s grief,' the Welfare and Social Affairs Ministry said. 'Survivors face many complex challenges in their recovery and healing processes. Together with the National Insurance Funds and partners like the 'Nova' association, we offer support and assistance to survivors.'

After drone targets PM residence, security overhaul coming	Despite an investment of over NIS 1 million in fortifying Benjamin Netanyahu's private home in Caesarea Shin Bet to review all , residence used by his family; 'Had he been home, he would have been in danger' Following the drone strike on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home in Caesarea, the Shin Bet is conducting a threat assessment of all government facilities, as the current security measures do not align with the growing threat posed by Iranian drones, according to a report on Sunday. A senior source commented, 'You protect one part of the body, but the blow comes somewhere else. This is a significant escalation and more effort is needed not only in interception but also in revising our fortifications.' As a result of this attempted strike, defense officials are expected to reevaluate renovation plans for the Prime Minister’s residence on Balfour Street in Jerusalem, currently undergoing a NIS 45 million upgrade. These adjustments could add at least another NIS 10 million to the project. Yossi Shelley, Director-General of the Prime Minister's Office, visited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea on Sunday, accompanied by Israel Tax Authority head, Shai Aharonovich, to assess the damage caused by a Hezbollah-launched drone strike from Lebanon. Aharonovich, who replaced the director of the Compensation Fund due to personal reasons, was joined by professional teams who evaluated and documented the damages. Contrary to earlier reports, most of the damage was to the structure itself. Sources familiar with the situation stated that if Netanyahu had been home during the attack, he could have been in real danger. The villa, which underwent over NIS 1 million in fortifications in recent years, will likely undergo further security evaluations. A senior figure familiar with the situation stated, 'The narrative that Netanyahu's homes are constantly being renovated to drain public funds is false. Netanyahu is arguably the most threatened leader in the world by hostile forces. If he had been in Caesarea on Saturday, we might not have a prime minister today. Relevant security decisions will need to be made.' Netanyahu stated last night that the drone launched from Lebanon toward his private residence in Caesarea was a failed assassination attempt on him and his wife, Sara. 'Iran's proxies who tried to assassinate me made a grave mistake,' he said.

What is Al-Qard al-Hassan association, now a target of IDF?	Bank provides Hezbollah with money laundering services and is one of the terror group's main financial assets; A 2021 data breach shows how it violated sanctions imposed in 2016, through ties with other financial institutions Al-Qard al-Hassan association that came under attack on Sunday is Hezbollah's alternative to Lebanon's banking system and was complicit in building Hezbollah's mini-state inside the country. Although it was founded as an association to aid families in need, it had become a bank in every sense of the word. The IDF said it was targeting the bank's branches to prevent funding to the Iran-backed terror group for its war. Founded in 1982, al-Qard al Hassan claimed its mission was to provide loans to all, regardless of religion or ethnicity to 'improve social cohesiveness and cooperation,' with branches spread around the country 'to save travel time.' According to the Alma Research and Education Center, it is one of Hezbollah's central financial assets. It has been under sanctions since 2016 and has more than 200,000 customers. It holds gold estimated to be in the tons, much in from jewelry given as collateral for loans and has loaned over half a billion dollars a year. Over time it became Hezbollah's main money laundering service. In 2021, the bank's data was breached and information on accounts, including those of sanctioned Hezbollah members, became public and included the bank's dealings with other financial institutions in violation of the sanctions imposed on it. Hezbollah runs infrastructure parallel to the government institutions, including in education, health, social, communication, energy and construction. These organizations provide support for the terror group's military and support its political position.

IDF targets Hezbollah's financial institutions	The Military spokesperson says Israel will reveal how Iran funds Hezbollah and its terror activities; IDF planes strike banks in Beirut's Dahieh and elsewhere around the country The IDF launched strikes on Hezbollah's financial institutions on Sunday after the military warned civilians to stay away in Beirut's Dahieh district and in the Bekaa Valley region. Panicked crowds clogged the streets and caused traffic jams in some parts of Beirut as they tried to get to neighborhoods thought to be safer, witnesses said. 'Anyone near sites used for Hezbollah's terrorist financing must evacuate immediately,' IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said and the Arabic Language spokesperson posted a similar warning on social media, shortly before the strikes began. 'In the coming days, we will reveal how Iran funds Hezbollah's terrorist activities using civilian institutions, associations, and charities as covers. We will strike these targets tonight and update on the results in the coming days,' Hagari said. The military said that infrastructure belonging to the Al-Qard al-Hassan association, linked to Hezbollah will be targeted. It has more than 30 branches across Lebanon including 15 in densely populated parts of central Beirut and its suburbs. 'A significant portion of Hezbollah's activities, funded by Iranian state budgets, is conducted through these funds, intended for terrorist activities, including armament, weapons storage facilities, launch sites, member salaries, and other operations,' the IDF said. 'We urge those inside Hezbollah-used structures to evacuate at least 500 meters away in the coming hours.' These banks, which IDF plans to attack, hold Iranian currency converted into dollars in Syria, arriving in Lebanon in suitcases—hundreds of millions to a billion dollars in cash annually, primarily for salaries and military infrastructure, according to military intelligence. The IDF said Hezbollah has become Lebanon's strongest and wealthiest employer amid an ongoing economic crisis that began in 2019. The average Hezbollah operative earns a monthly salary of $500. The economic association serving as Hezbollah's bank is subject to heavy sanctions and therefore not connected to international clearing systems. It operates 35 branches across Lebanon with ATMs. According to IDF, all of Hezbollah's financial reserves are held in cash and gold at these branches. Hezbollah's financial power centers will also be targeted. 'This will destabilize Hezbollah, preventing it from providing stability and security to its operatives and employees,' the military said. 'Hezbollah structured this as an association and system from which it financially benefits, including schools and clinics. Many buildings will fall, and assets will be targeted. The operation is part of the strategic plan against Hezbollah.'

Shin Bet chief meets new Egyptian intelligence chief to advance h...	Ronen Bar held an introductory meeting with Egypt's Hassan Rashad, while the families of hostages urge the government to push for a deal in light of Sinwar's assassination Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar traveled to Cairo on Sunday for an introductory meeting with Egypt's new intelligence chief, Hassan Rashad, to advance negotiations and move forward on discussions for a deal after the assassination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Ahead of Sunday's security cabinet meeting, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant held a discussion on efforts to bring back hostages held in Gaza by Hamas. The meeting was attended by IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and other security officials. After the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week, families of hostages called on the government to push for a cease-fire and hostage release deal. Several families gathered at the Hostage Families' Headquarters in Tel Aviv on Sunday, demanding progress on a deal under the banner: 'Enough excuses—it's time to bring the hostages home.' Sharon Sharabi, brother of Yossi (murdered) and Eli, said: 'Recent developments have created a real opportunity to bring the hostages back.' He said Sinwar had been the obstacle to an agreement. 'Now that obstacle has been removed, it’s time to fulfill the will of the Israeli public and act according to the moral compass that’s been ignored for a whole year. People are celebrating the impressive achievements of the IDF and security forces, but let’s not forget—the main goal has yet to be achieved. The prime minister promised to bring everyone back. It’s time to deliver.' Gilad Korngold, the father of hostage Tal Shoham, echoed this sentiment. 'There will be no victory until the last hostage returns.' He recounted that it has been '380 days since my Tal was kidnapped to Gaza from Kibbutz Be'eri, along with his whole family—my grandchildren, my daughter-in-law, her mother, her aunt, and her cousin. Victory will be measured by the supreme moral test of bringing them back. Prime Minister, it is your duty, both Jewish and state, to bring them all home.' Korngold then directly addressed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: 'After the assassination, you said the main mission is to bring them back. We demand to know what you are concretely planning to do to make this happen. Their time is up. If you can’t bring the hostages back, have the courage to tell the public. If that’s not the case, use your majority to bring them home. We demand answers and action. Their time has run out, and so have your excuses.'

House speaker says is investigating leak of Israel's Iran attack ...	We are following it closely,' Mike Jonson says adding he is to be briefed on the matter; Israeli officials say incident could increase mistrust in Washington; they say they hope the leaker is found and prosecuted to prevent similar incidents The United States is investigating the leak of a pair of highly classified intelligence documents describing Israel's preparations for a retaliatory strike on Iran, House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday. The documents appear to have been prepared by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, describing U.S. interpretations of Israeli Air Force and Navy planning based on satellite imagery from Oct. 15-16. They began circulating last week on the Telegram messaging app. Israel has been planning a response to a ballistic missile barrage carried out by Iran on Oct. 1, its second direct attack on Israel in six months. Israel has intensified its offensive in Gaza and Lebanon, days after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Asked about the leak of the documents during an interview with CNN, Johnson, the U.S. House of Representatives' top lawmaker, said an 'investigation (is) underway and I'll get a briefing on that in a couple of hours,' he said adding, 'We are following it closely,' Johnson added. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Pentagon said it was looking into the leak reports. The documents do not contain details or an overall picture of the targets of the attack, but rather general preparations for a long-range attack by the Air Force, which the intelligence professionals and the Revolutionary Guards Air Force could have assessed for themselves using the basic intelligence they already have. The Pentagon did not officially confirm an investigation into the leak was underway but said they were aware of the reports. The documents appeared on a pro-Iranian Telegram channel called Middle East Spectator which had posted support for Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the regime, in the past. Israeli officials said the leak was an embarrassment for the Pentagon just one year after dozens of classified documents about the Russian war on Ukraine, were leaked by a U.S. Air Force IT technician. The leak shows how closely the Americans are watching Israel, despite the close alliance between the two nations and its revelation was the source of some discomfort and damage to the credibility of the American security and intelligence agencies. Israeli officials said they expected the leaker to be found and prosecuted so that such events do not occur but added that the leak would not prompt Israelis to hide information from their American counterparts although, it may increase some mistrust already felt against Washington.

We thank Allah for this honor,' owner of house where Nasrallah w...	I lived in this house for 15 years', says Ayman Abu Taha who left his Rafah home last May says he is proud the arch-terrorist 'achieved martyrdom' in his apartment Ayman Abu Taha, the proprietor of the apartment where Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar made his last stand, recounted his departure from his Rafah home to Khan Younis on May 6. Since then, he has been in the dark about his home's condition. In a BBC interview, he stated, 'I lived in this house for 15 years with my family. We never had to leave it, not even during previous wars. Nothing forced me to leave the house except for the approaching Israeli bombings and the evacuation and displacement orders issued to all my neighbors in Rafah.' Abu Taha went on to describe how his daughter first showed him photos circulating on social media, allegedly capturing Sinwar's final moments in their home. Initially skeptical, he only believed it when his brother confirmed the house in the images was indeed his. Reflecting on this revelation, Abu Taha shared, 'I was taken aback when I saw it. I couldn’t believe my eyes. But my brother called and confirmed it was our house, and that’s when the reality hit me. I received the news in disbelief. It's still hard to undestand.' On Instagram, under the account 'gaza_sweet,' Abu Taha expressed his family's pride in what they considered the 'honor' of Sinwar dying in their home. The house, situated on Ibn Sena Street in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood of western Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, became a symbol of defiance. In his post, he shared before-and-after images of the house from the war, highlighting the sofa where Sinwar sat when a drone captured him just moments before his death. 'The purest and most respected sofa and chair in the world are in our home. May Allah have mercy on you and grant you paradise, Abu Ibrahim (Sinwar),' Abu Taha wrote. In another post, he noted, 'Our home has been elevated in honor and pride with Abu Ibrahim. We thank Allah for this bestowed honor.' In a third post, Abu Taha continued, 'On behalf of myself and the Abu Taha family, we are all proud that Abu Ibrahim achieved martyrdom in our home.' Adding his voice, his cousin Muhammad Sami Abu Taha commented on Sinwar’s demise in the apartment, writing that he 'perished there as a fighter until his last breath. We hold immense pride in him and all who have walked this path of redemption.'

Israel has no ambassador in the UAE, despite importance of post	Amir Hayek, the only Israeli ambassador to an Arab country who did not return to Israel following the outbreak of the war, completed his term last Friday, leaving one of Israel's most friendly allies in the Gulf without an ambassador Since last Friday, Israel has been left without an ambassador to the United Arab Emirates after Amir Hayek, a political appointee of the previous government, completed his term and returned to Israel. Hayek was the only Israeli ambassador posted to an Arab country who did not return home following the outbreak of the war, remaining in Abu Dhabi all year. Yossi Shelley, the director-general of the Prime Minister's Office, is expected to replace Hayek. In July, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved the posting. However, Shelley has yet to assume the role, and the Foreign Ministry has not yet taken the steps to approve Shelley in the ministry. The delay is due to the government's earlier political appointments in the foreign service and the next time such a posting becomes available will be in February 2025.

Col. Ehsan Daqsa, brigade commander, falls in northern Gaza	The 41-year-old officer was killed by an explosive in Jabaliya; 'A hero of Israel, a courageous, humble, and principled warrior,' President Issac Herzog says 41-year-old Colonel Ehsan Daqsa from the Druze city of Daliyat al-Karmel, commander of the 401st Brigade within the 162nd Division, fell on Sunday when an IED exploded in Jabaliya, in the northern Gaza Strip. Another officer was seriously hurt in the incident and two others sustained light injuries. Ehsan took up his command in June. 'I am filled with pride to receive the privilege of commanding you, a special and courageous generation of fighters and commanders who have been fighting non-stop for many months and continue to fight even at this moment as we speak,' he said when he was appointed. 'We all bear a very great responsibility: first, the clear need to perform our missions as fighters to the best of our ability, seeking engagement and decisively defeating Hamas wherever it may be found, and against any enemy required to face in other arenas and second that we be worthy of you, the brave fighters and commanders, and our heroic wounded who fight to recover, some of whom have even returned to the battlefield. And, of course, that we be worthy of the fallen and the dear bereaved families.' Ehsan is the highest-ranking officer to have fallen since the ground operation began in the Strip, alongside Colonel Yitzhak Ben-Bashat, following the loss of three other battalion commanders on October 7. During the fatal incident, Ehsan entered Jabaliya with two tanks—his own and that of the 52nd Battalion commander—reaching the forefront of the raid. From this point, four soldiers, including Ehsan, the battalion commander, and two additional officers, went on to conduct reconnaissance just 25 yards away from their tanks. At this observation point, they encountered an explosive device wired for detonation. The blast fatally wounded Ehsan, and the battalion's doctor declared him dead at the scene. The three other injured were airlifted to a hospital, with the 52nd Battalion commander seriously wounded, while the other two officers sustained lighter injuries. Investigations are ongoing to determine if they were also subjected to gunfire. According to military intelligence, Hamas, which has resumed operations in Jabaliya, was struggling to cope with the IDF operations after some 5,000 additional Gazans left the area for the south, over the weekend. In Daliyat al-Karmel, Ehsan's hometown, his death was met with profound grief. 'Daliyat al-Karmel is in mourning,' Mayor Rafiq Halabi said in a post. 'How the mighty have fallen. With sorrow, pain, and much mourning, Daliyat al-Karmel, the military, the Druze community, and the State of Israel bid farewell to one of their heroes. Today, Colonel Ehsan Daqsa fell in Gaza—a hero, brave, a warrior who became a legend, humble, and who fought since the war's onset.' President Issac Herzog called Ehsan a hero. 'Alongside all of Israel, I received with sorrow and pain the bitter news of the fall of the 401st Brigade commander, Colonel Ehsan Daqsa, who fell today in the battles in Jabaliya. Ehsan—a hero of Israel, a courageous, humble, and principled warrior—his fall is a loss to the State of Israel and all of Israeli society. I salute him and embrace his family, the community of Daliyat al-Karmel, and our brothers and sisters from the Druze community who have lost many dear sons since the beginning of the fighting, with dedication, a sense of mission, and a shared destiny.' Sheikh Muwaffak Tarif, the spiritual leader of the Druze community, said the IDF lost one of its finest. 'This is a very difficult and painful loss for the State of Israel, the military, and the Druze community. It is unfathomable that the hero destined for greatness is no longer with us. Our hearts and feelings are with the family in these unbearable moments, as their world turns upside down with the receipt of the harsh and bitter news. The Druze community continues to pay the ultimate and most precious price in the war—losing the finest sons and officers.' Forces from the 162nd Division entered the third week of their operation in Jabaliya, after previous maneuvers in November and December, and a raid by the 98th Division on its refugee camp in May. Unlike prior raids in the ongoing Phase C of the battle against Hamas, which will extend into the coming years, the military faced challenges evacuating the city's population, allowing hundreds of Hamas militants to regroup under its cover. As reported first by Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth, military assessments suggest this operation may last for many weeks, possibly months, despite recent reports of significant departures of Gazans from the encircled area. Forces from the 460th and 401st Armored Brigades, recently joined by the Givati Brigade, have, according to military sources, eliminated hundreds of terrorists and located numerous weapons caches, as well as combat tunnels that were destroyed and later re-dug by Hamas. Following the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Ehsan received a commendation for assisting paratroopers who called for help in southern Lebanon. 'One of the soldiers shouted over the radio that they were under heavy fire,' Ehsan recalled the battle in the village of Aita al-Shaab about a year after the incident. At that time, Ehsan, then the commander of the 'Kfir' Armored Company, went out to help the soldiers with his team. Hezbollah militants tried to hit him and his soldiers with anti-tank missiles but missed. When they reached the area of the house where the paratroopers were staying, they fired a shell at another house where Hezbollah operatives were located, and the enemy fire ceased. He then managed to make eye contact with the paratrooper company commander, who reported over the radio that one of his soldiers was killed, and four others were wounded. Then came the most challenging part of the event—Ehsan and another soldier from his tank crew rescued the paratroopers and brought them to the tank, which carried a total of nine soldiers to the border fence. 'I have no doubt I would do the same today,' he said about a year after the war. The commendation justification noted that Ehsan demonstrated 'boldness, bravery, resourcefulness, and professionalism.'

Western diplomats voice concern Israel prolonging war	Former Jordanian Foreign Minister claims Netanyahu does not want to give Harris a win by agreeing to a cease-fire; others say IDF military achievements should be leveraged to end the fighting and complain that Israel is acting alone Western diplomats expressed concern that Israel will prolong the war despite its recent military accomplishments in the combat zones of Gaza and Lebanon, and not use them to reach a cease-fire. In briefings, the diplomats praised successes —such as the elimination of Yahya Sinwar and Hassan Nasrallah, and the coordinated pager attack in Lebanon, but urged that the momentum achieved —diplomats around the globe are urging the use of this momentum to forge diplomatic agreements. 'At this stage, diplomacy alone isn't sufficient,' an Israeli official said. Several diplomats have suggested that Prime Minister Netanyahu was also factoring in how a ceasefire might influence the upcoming U.S. elections. They believe that any breakthrough in negotiations would benefit Vice President Kamala Harris and that Netanyahu prefers to engage with Donald Trump. 'There’s no reason for Netanyahu to halt his conflicts before the U.S. elections,' said Marwan al-Muasher, a former Jordanian foreign minister. 'He doesn’t intend to hand Harris any credit or gift before the elections.' President Joe Biden said on Sunday that a ceasefire in Lebanon is achievable, though it would be more challenging in Gaza. Trump on the other hand said Netanyahu was doing a good job. 'Biden is trying to hold him back when he should be doing the opposite.' the Republican candidate said adding that the Sinwar's killing will make it easier to reach peace. 'I am pleased that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to do what was necessary,' he said. A senior Western diplomat claimed that after Israel 'managed to unsettle Hezbollah and surprise them and the entire world,' it should 'seize the opportunity and pursue a settlement in Lebanon,' adding 'We were astonished by Israel’s achievements in Lebanon. These are significant intelligence and military accomplishments.' Nevertheless, discussions with this senior diplomat, along with others, reveal a deeply worrying picture—a lack of trust in Israel's plans for Lebanon. This skepticism helps explain UNIFIL's strong opposition to complying with the IDF's demand to withdraw 3 miles northward. 'There is substantial concern in the international community that Israel's ground operation will deepen, leading to casualties among Lebanese civilians and UNIFIL forces,' explained the senior diplomat. 'There is significant apprehension about getting embroiled in Lebanon. Israel spoke of an operation lasting a few days—yet it has already extended beyond two weeks and is intensifying. We fear waking up in six months to find you still entrenched in Lebanon and fighting.' He went on to say that there was a willingness within the international community to expand UNIFIL’s mandate, but negotiations were necessary for that to happen. 'Any occupation of Lebanon would be a grave mistake and would provide Hezbollah with justification to continue its activities,' he said adding he was disappointed with Israel’s approach. 'Unfortunately, they aren’t communicating with anyone, which is why UNIFIL refuses to relocate—it contradicts their mandate and would also be humiliating.' He said that despite the severe blows Hezbollah has sustained, the terrorist organization still has leadership capable of making decisions if needed. 'There is an understanding in the international community about the seriousness of the Hezbollah threat. We are at risk of entanglement, and an operation initially intended for a few days could drag on for months. 'Today, we understand that UNIFIL's mandate was flawed, and it needs to be reconsidered or replaced with another mandate,' he said. 'The international community is open to this idea. It is clear to everyone that a different solution for southern Lebanon is necessary—because the problem must not be allowed to resurface. The West needs to consider how it will contribute to the solution. Negotiations will make this possible.' He also added, 'Many Lebanese would like to see Hezbollah vanish. But an Israeli occupation in Lebanon would be a mistake, as it would give Hezbollah a pretext to act. Do not provide Hezbollah with excuses. Israel needs a mechanism to oversee and enforce an agreement. This will require forces on the ground.' He reiterated that 'Israel's lack of communication with anyone is a mistake,' asserting, 'Israel will not achieve all its objectives in Lebanon. It had success against Hezbollah, and this should be leveraged to reach an agreement.'

Jewish-American billionaire hell-bent on Trump losing presidentia...	Mark Cuban, the successful businessman and co-star of TV's Shark Tank is a one-man army against Elon Musk and other billionaires who support Trump's race for the White House by propping up his opponent VP Harris The American presidential elections will be held in 16 days, but the seven most important states that will determine the country's next four years are already voting. As of Saturday, about 12 million Americans have already voted, with the most impressive figure coming from Georgia, where more than a million people, about 9% of the southern state's population, voted. Both campaigns are recruiting all the help they can get for the final stretch. As far as Donald Trump is concerned, this is mainly a very long line of billionaires, who continue to pour huge sums into organizations that are not subjected to laws concerning donations. Kamala Harris, on the other hand, is using mainly popular names, starting with the Obamas and ending with the singers Lizo and Usher. Recently, a new and intriguing name was added to the list: Mark Cuban, a billionaire and a celebrity. Cuban who is Jewish, is a household name for his plethora of projects, assets and television appearances over the years. At one point he was the owner of the Dallas Mavericks from the NBA, and in recent years has starred on the popular reality show Shark Tank. His fortune is estimated at more than six billion dollars, and he became a multi-millionaire mainly thanks to his early technological investments. However, his best investment was the Dallas Mavericks. In 2000, he became the main shareholder in the group for $285 million, and a quarter of a century later the Mavericks are worth between four and a half billion dollars and five and a half billion. Cuban sold most of his shares in the group last year, but still holds a professional-managerial position. Shortly after Harris replaced Joe Biden as the presidential candidate, Cuban announced his support for her, as an almost one-man army, trying to debunk Trump's narrative that the Republican candidate is a successful businessman with superior economic policies. It started with a Twitter fight with Trump supporters, but last week Cuban decided to take it a step further and get on stage. On Thursday, he appeared at a campaign rally in Wisconsin, where he said Trump's trade and tariff policies would bring back inflation and crush the dreams of entrepreneurs, by making their costs impossible. Cuban was in Arizona on Saturday and is expected to appear in Michigan alongside Harris' husband, Doug Amhoff on Sunday. So far, Cuban's support for Harris does not include financial contributions, but he does coordinate with the campaign, which has moved to a very aggressive line of attack against the 78-year-old Trump's ability to function. Over the weekend, sources within Trump's campaign leaked to Politico that he cut back on appearances and canceled four consecutive interviews because he was 'exhausted.' The news quickly made headlines and Harris campaign ads. Harris' campaigns focuses on the question whether Trump to fit to serve the toughest job in the world in his condition.

Enslaved by ISIS, liberated by IDF: The story of Fawzia Amin Sido	Fawzia captured and treated as a sex slave by the Islamic State in Syria, routinely beaten, raped and forced to devour human flesh to survive, and upon arriving in Gaza, witnessed the cruelty of Hamas, eventually liberated by Israeli forces Fawzia Amin Sido, a young Yazidi woman who was abducted by ISIS as a child in 2014 and ended up in Gaza said she had endured starvation, abuse and rape. She was rescued by Israeli forces and returned to her family. In an interview with Britain's The Sun, Sido recounted the chilling events from a decade ago when she, along with other Yazidi women and girls, was forcibly taken to Tal Afar. There, they were deprived of food for four excruciating days until their captors finally fed them upon reaching northwestern Iraq. Some of the details ahead are painfully graphic. 'They cooked rice and meat and gave it to us to eat. We were so hungry that we immediately ate everything on the table,' Sido recalled. 'We knew something was wrong because the taste was strange, but we were starving. After we finished, we all had stomach aches and felt unwell. Then they told us that the meat we ate was from babies.' She described how one woman succumbed to a heart attack and died instantly. They showed us pictures of babies whose heads were decapitated and said, 'These are the children you ate.' It was very difficult, but it's not our fault. They forced it on us. It wasn't in our hands,' she said. In a chilling description, Sido added that mothers of babies cried and screamed at that moment because they understood why they were separated from their babies. 'One of them even recognized her son in the pictures they showed her.' In early 2015, Fawzia was transferred to al-Raqqa, where she was held underground for nine months in degrading conditions alongside roughly 200 other women. 'We were in darkness all the time, we didn't see sunlight,' she said. 'We did nothing, we couldn't go outside. We drank dirty water, some girls died. It was a very difficult time.' She said men occasionally entered their holding area, 'choosing a girl they fancied and taking her with them.' Fawzia herself was bought and sold five times by ISIS militants during her years in Syria. The fifth man to purchase her was a Palestinian ISIS fighter, ten years her senior. He used drugs to rape her when she was just 14, and he was 24. 'At first, I hid in the bathroom while he slept because I didn't know what he wanted from me,' she said. 'I was scared and didn't want him to do anything. When he noticed I was hiding, he gave me drugs and put me to sleep, and then he raped me.' He abused her until she was 15, and she bore him a son and a daughter. By 2018, as the Islamic State was pushed out from Syria, she lost contact with her captor. She was subsequently sent to the notorious Al-Hol camp in northeastern Syria, home to ruthless ISIS militants and their families, including Western Muslims who joined them. 'ISIS women were very mean to me and forced me to work for them,' she said. 'I always did what they told me because I was so young and scared. They also tried to force me to be Muslim.' Eight months later, she learned her Palestinian captor was imprisoned in Idlib, Syria. Fearing for her children's future, she traveled to Gaza to live with his family. She was taken there via Turkey and Egypt with a forged passport, finally arriving in 2020. Along the way, she traversed an underground tunnel in Idlib, where some people died from lack of oxygen, before walking 31 hours to her next stop in Turkey. Fawzia hoped her husband's family in Gaza would respect her as the mother of his children, yet she faced humiliation there too. Regularly beaten, she was effectively imprisoned in her home under Hamas rule. Meanwhile, she was informed that her husband had been killed. Contrary to reports, she did not remarry his brother. 'I was never free to do what I wanted in Gaza. Had I been, I would have left much sooner. I couldn’t leave; I was constantly under their control. Once, Hamas members held a gun to my head when I went outside with a friend. They told me I wasn’t allowed to.' She said that, in reality, Hamas treated her like a slave. After the massacre on October 7, she was sent to work as a slave in a hospital, saying that 'all hospitals served as Hamas bases. Everyone was armed. Weapons were everywhere.' Only on October 1 this year was she finally released from Gaza after months of diplomatic efforts between the U.S., Iraq, and Israel, risking her life in the process. Following her release, Hamas claimed she lived in Gaza willingly and only wanted to leave because of the war. 'That is an outright lie,' she said. 'I was never free there. I was compelled to stay at home. When I was in Israel and knew there was no more Hamas, I was overjoyed. I could breathe again. They are very evil; they killed people and forced me to stay there. Why would I want to stay there? They claim the experiences I describe didn’t happen to me; they should have been there instead of me. There’s no difference between Hamas and ISIS. I didn’t believe I would be saved until it actually happened.' Fawzia is reluctant to discuss her children, now aged five and six, whom she hasn't seen for several months. Her lawyer mentioned, 'We don’t discuss her children much; they were taken from her long before she left Gaza. Not taking them with her wasn’t her choice. She had no option to reunite with them. She hopes to build a new life, but she doesn’t want to do it in Iraq, where she still fears. What she describes is only 15%-20% of all she endured. She needs a lot more time.'

Man arrested after spreading rumors of hostages freed on TikTok	The 33-year-old suspect posted video claiming that 30 families of hostages were informed their loved ones were rescued from Hamas captivity; suspect is accused of disturbing the peace by knowingly spreading false rumors meant to incite fear and panic The Israel Police arrested a 33-year-old man for spreading false rumors of hostage rescue from Hamas captivity in Gaza. During his interrogation, the suspect apologized multiple times, claiming he heard the news from friends and was unaware it was false. He is accused of disturbing the peace by knowingly spreading false rumors meant to incite fear and panic. 'We will not tolerate actions that harm the feelings of hostage families,' a source in the police said. The suspect was placed on house arrest for five days. Rumers of a rescue of hostages spread quickly around the country, causing false hopes and distress to the families of the captives. The IDF spokesperson made three public statements saying there was no rescue and asking the pubic not to spread unreliable news. Meanwhile, TikTok blocked the suspect's accounts. 'Spreading misinformation is prohibited on our platform,' the company said after it had faced criticism throughout the war for amplifying pro-Palestinian content while suppressing pro-Israeli material. The suspect's account called 'The Shadow 7000,' has more than 52,000 followers. On Saturday he posted a video to his followers, claiming that 30 families had been informed that their loved ones had been rescued from Hamas captivity—some alive, some dead. 'There was a very emotional rescue operation that lasted nearly three hours,' he said in the video, making him one of the main sources of the false rumors that the IDF had to publicly deny three times within 24 hours. 'Unfortunately, there are both good and less good news. This was a significant operation, and it will be remembered in history. Please, for those of you waiting anxiously for updates, continue to be patient.' Ironically, in his posts, the suspect urged his followers to refrain from spreading false information, saying it harmed the families of the hostages: 'Please don’t spread fake news or rumors. Everyone keeps sending me guesses—stop it. There are families waiting for news about their loved ones. Please be considerate.' Later, the suspect posted another video, giving false details about hostages allegedly rescued alive, even naming them. One of the hostages he falsely claimed had been freed was lookout soldier Liri Albag, whose name was also spread in WhatsApp messages. 'At around 11 pm on Saturday, there was a surge of rumors about the rescue of hostages, Liri's mother Shira said. 'We got messages from people and heard reports of something happening in Jabaliya and Rafah. There were rumors about helicopters at hospitals. We didn’t sleep all night. Things calmed down in the morning, but by noon, another wave of rumors started. People were sending us texts asking us what was going on,' she said. 'It causes unbearable anxiety, making you wait for a knock on the door. Many times when rumors spread, there was some truth to them. We called the IDF officers we are in contact with, who said they didn’t know anything, but we didn’t know if we should believe them. There were so many specific rumors at the same time. We all took calming pills just to try to breathe. We posted on Liri’s Instagram, asking people to stop doing this. 'The names were specific, but then again, they were of families already prominent in the media. We wondered if maybe it was an Iranian bot spreading these rumors as psychological warfare. We thought, 'With so much talk, something must have happened. Maybe there was a terrible event with soldiers killed?' It’s just awful.' Gal Hirsch, Israel's coordinator for POWs and MIAs, has requested that police and the Shin Bet open a criminal investigation into the source of the rumors.

France says Israeli companies welcome at Euronaval if not involve...	After deciding to ban Israeli companies from the world's largest naval weapons exhibition, organizers seemingly amend ban but in practice leave Israelis out Following the decision to ban Israeli companies from exhibiting at Euronaval, the world's largest naval weapons exhibition set to take place in Paris, the organizing body announced the companies would be allowed to participate — on the condition that they were not involved in the IDF's efforts in Gaza and Lebanon. In practice, however, there isn't an Israeli company that wasn't part of the war effort, which makes the apparent amendment irrelevant. 'The exhibition organizers acknowledge the decision of the National Defense and Security Council dated October 1, 2024, as clarified by the decision of October 18, 2024, which stipulates that Israeli companies wishing to participate in the Euronaval exhibition may do so. They may have an exhibition stand, provided that their products are not used in military operations in Gaza and Lebanon,' the organizers wrote in a statement on the event’s website. The annual exhibition features hundreds of international companies that develop naval vessels and weapons and has always included numerous representatives of Israel's defense industries. Israel Shipyards is set to petition a French court in the coming days. The company was planning to showcase its Mini Shaldag vessel, a fast boat designed for patrol and interception suitable for shallow waters; the OPV45 ship, developed at the Haifa shipyard in recent years and the Reshef S80 ship, a similar model of which is set to join the Israeli Navy in the coming years. 'The boycott on Israel forces the country to rely on itself and develop a strategic, local and independent military industry,' said Israel Shipyards CEO Eitan Zucker. This marks the second time France has decided to ban Israeli companies from prestigious weapons exhibitions. In June, Israeli companies were barred from exhibiting at the Eurosatory 2024 event, with Israeli individuals being denied entry to the event. The French government appealed the decision in court following a public uproar, leading to it being overturned, though much of the damage had already been done. Twelve Israeli companies were interested in exhibiting at the naval fair, and local participation will almost certainly be blocked from the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget, the crown jewel of such exhibitions should this negative trend continue. Although the event is scheduled for June, preparations start many months in advance. An Israeli source said that France has become a symbol of left-wing embargoes on Israel, noting that French companies had asked President Emmanuel Macron to ban Israeli companies for commercial reasons behind the scenes.

IDF to outsource maintenance of tanks, APCs amid increased load	Military for the first time in history will offer tenders to security industries aiming to restore and maintain armored vehicles damaged in the war The IDF, for the first time in its history, will outsource the repair and maintenance of its various armored vehicles including tanks and APCs to companies in the Israeli defense industry due to the urgent need seen in the year-long war against Hezbollah and Hamas. The repairs were previously carried out exclusively by the IDF’s Technology and Maintenance Corps. Ynet learned on Sunday that the Defense Ministry will issue the first tender on the matter in the coming months via its Department of Production and Procurement. Additionally, the department, in consultation with the IDF, will decide on whether to transfer part of the armored vehicle production, currently performed by the Technology and Maintenance Corps, to local industries. Armored combat vehicles have seen substantial wear due to the ongoing war and require maintenance and repairs to ensure continuous operational activity. The load on the IDF on this matter is extremely high. To manage routine tasks, the Technology and Maintenance Corps has even employed retirees — former professionals volunteering to assist the army. Moreover, the IDF will need to restore all its armored vehicles to full readiness once the war concludes. According to the Defense Ministry, this will require a years-long process given the vast number of vehicles and the need for a large quantity of spare parts. The IDF and the Defense Ministry have concluded that the scope of this task necessitates, for the first time, collaboration with external entities — Israeli industries that will take part in the mission. Another conclusion drawn from the war is the need to significantly expand the IDF’s fleet of armored vehicles. The relevant industries for the tender are heavy industries involved in metalwork, such as large-scale welding and machining. Among the candidates are companies like Israel Shipyards, Ahot Ashkelon Industries, Elta Systems, Nidec and others. It was also reported that the Defense Ministry has already held preliminary talks with these companies, which have shown a willingness to participate in the tender and invest in the necessary equipment to integrate into the military’s system. 'So far, we haven't had an industry for restoration and assembly,' A Defense Ministry source told Ynet. 'The increased procurement needs of the IDF and the necessity to restore existing equipment required us to think differently.' The war highlighted the critical need for Israel’s independence in all supply aspects for the IDF and strengthening local industries, partly due to difficulties in acquiring ammunition and equipment from abroad, as some countries don’t allow certain components to be exported to Israel. The Israeli munitions industry (including Israel Aerospace Industries, Israel Military Industries, Elbit Systems, etc.) has doubled and even tripled its production capacity, based on the IDF's promise to maintain a steady stream of orders even after the war, making the investment worthwhile.

Former Sodastream CEO offers Gazans $100K for living hostages	Daniel Birnbaum offers to reward Gazans for taking 'responsibility for their lives and guarantee a better future for them and their families' by October 24; He gave the names of the respondents to the IDF for authentication After Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on the residents of Gaza to return hostages to Israel in the wake of the assassination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, and promised that Israel would allow those who do so to leave the Gaza Strip safely, the former CEO of Sodastream is also joining the effort to bring them home. In a video published on Saturday, Daniel Birnbaum offered a cash reward of $100,000 to whoever returns Israeli living hostages. 'This is a message for the good people in Gaza. I have an offer for you. My name is Daniel Birnbaum, and I was CEO and chairman of Sodastream International, a Nasdaq-traded company acquired by PepsiCo,' Birnbaum said in the video. 'This year was a terrible year. It's time to wrap things up. It's time to move on.' 'A few days ago, Benjamin Netanyahu promised free passage and immunity to anyone who delivers an Israeli hostage to Israel. I would like to add to that a financial reward. Anyone in Gaza who returns a living Israeli hostage , will receive $100,000. That would be paid either by cash or by Bitcoin, as you prefer,' he offered. 'Don't wait. This offer is valid until Wednesday midnight, October 24, just a few days. Reach out to this number by Telegram or Whatsapp in confidence and I will make the appropriate connections to assure your free passage and reward money so don't wait. It's time for you to take control of your life, to build a future for yourself, for your family, and for your community,' he added. Birnbaum told Ynet he is receiving a flood of calls, including calls from Gaza, but their reliability is still unclear. He is passing the calls to an IDF official who will verify their authenticity. In the video, he chose to speak in English because he thought that maybe an American would be believed more than an Israeli. Birnbaum is ready to pay the required amount from his pocket even if reliable information about dozens of hostages arrives. He said that the payment is his contribution to the release of the hostages. In his years as CEO of Sodastream, Birnbaum empowered and promoted Palestinian workers in the company as a long-term goal. He believed in cooperation and cared for their well-being in a way that was hardly seen elsewhere. On several occasions, Birnbaum held communal Ramadan Iftar meals (meals for breaking the daily fasts) for Jewish and Muslim employees, promoting friendship and peace. Birnbaum said in response to the question of whether he still believes in coexistence, for which he worked with all his might, that he is holding on to twigs of hope and optimism to continue believing in coexistence. It is very difficult for him, he says, because the world proves otherwise, but according to him we don't have a choice. Right now, Birnbaum says there is a time to love and a time to hate and a time to fight and a time for peace and now, in the last year, it is the time for war. He said that In times of war, you have to fight and at some point, you have to change the track, but we don't change the track until we return the hostages. He knows Israel will not heal as a people and will not be able to move on unless the hostages return. Birnbaum, who served as CEO and chairman of the Sodastream company before it was sold to PepsiCo, is said to be an 'expert in aligning global trends and values ​​with business interests.' During his successful tenure, Sodastream went public and was sold to PepsiCo in 2018 for $3.2 billion. For the sale, he was promised a $34 million bonus in exchange for staying with the company for another three years. He later was accused of giving inside information to a company employee, and was sentenced to a month in prison as part of a plea deal. Finally, he spent 22 days in prison after being pardoned by President Isaac Herzog.

UN Ambassador Danon files complaint against UN chief for antisemi...	Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, submitted a letter of complaint to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres following a report on the right to food, in which he claims that Israel is committing genocide through starvation. Danon said that this is a disgraceful antisemitic report that tries to rewrite the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, promoting incitement against the State of Israel. According to Danon, Hamas' cynical exploitation of the humanitarian aid provided by Israel imposes terror on the Palestinians.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkjswdmljg	2024-10-20T05:33:55-07:00

Nova survivor and rescued hostage return to the festival	A year after the Nova festival massacre, Yannai Eliyahu and his cousin Shlomi, who was rescued from Hamas captivity, achieve closure on Yannai's 24th birthday: 'It took me back but it was important to me' On October 6, 2023, right before the October 7 massacre, Shlomi Ziv, his wife's cousins Aviv Eliyahu and his younger brother Yannai went south to the Nova music festival near Kibbutz Re'im. Shlomi, who worked in security for the party, went to work together with Aviv, the security director for Nova. Aviv was murdered, Shlomi was kidnapped and Yannai survived. A year later the two men returned to the field of horrors. Yannai came to the festivalhang out with friends. All three relatives who grew up together were in daily contact and involved in each other's lives. The Hamas attack on the Western Negev that began on October 7 at 6:29 a.m. brutally separated the three. Aviv was killed by Hamas terrorists. Shlomi was kidnapped to Gaza and was rescued in August in Operation Arnon. Yannai managed to hide and escape from the carnage. Friday marked Yannai's 24th birthday and, for the first time since the October 7 massacre, the two surviving relatives managed to put the past behind them. Yannai asked Shlomi to join him at the party to celebrate with him. Despite the difficult scenery and the accompanying memories, this time they celebrated life and the fact that they returned safely home. 'On Thursday and Friday before the party, it was difficult for me,' Shlomi, 40, told Ynet. 'The whole situation took me back there. To travel to the south again, to return to the party again. But it was important to get closure. Both for me personally and for Yannai, to be truly happy with him, so he would enjoy himself, and also to commemorate Aviv with dance and joy. It was amazing.' Did you manage to dance and feel happy? 'Yes, very much. There were other freed people there and more survivors from that horrible Saturday. Maybe they also wanted to achieve closure. I kept looking at the clock. I wanted to pass 6:29 a.m. without sirens and without all the bad things that happened. The original producers of the Nova festival organized the party. They are doing amazing things as part of the commemoration efforts.' Miran, Shlomi's wife, added, 'Yannai is like our little brother. He is my favorite. He was in the third grade when we got married and I always told him that I would bring down the moon for him. He came to the Nova party last year on Friday night, a day after Shlomi and Aviv. Amid all the unfolding events, he hid and took care of the wounded. He tried to contact Aviv who told him to go to a trailer.' 'In retrospect, Yannai was already on the escape route so it's a good thing because the whole area was attacked and he might not have survived. At some point, Aviv stopped answering him and he passed out. He realized that something very bad had happened. He jumped into a car together with friends and they drove toward a base. When they shot at them, they changed direction and managed to reach Netivot,' she added. How did you feel when they went to the party, again? 'I was worried, it set me back. But I took a breath and calmed down. I said to myself, let them go, have fun, let them get it out of their system. I trust Shlomi completely. I understood him and supported him. The photo of Shlomi and Yannai is one of our great victory photos. They passed 6:29 a.m. and saw the sunrise that they couldn't see a year ago,' Miran said.

Trump: 'Bibi wouldn't listen to Biden', Harris doesn't deny Gaza ...	U.S. presidential candidates make outlandish and appeasing statements two week prior to elections in final bid to grow voter base Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. president Donald Trump said during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania overnight between Saturday and Sunday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told him he 'wouldn’t listen' to U.S. President Joe Biden in a phone call that took place close to the event. 'Bibi called me today and he said, it's pretty incredible, but he wouldn't listen to Biden because if he did, they wouldn't be in this position,' Trump said, using the prime minister's nickname. Talking about U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, Trump said at the rally: 'She’s worse than him [Biden], she’s not as smart as him. And I’m not saying he’s the smartest — but she’s not as smart as him.' Meanwhile, Harris was filmed agreeing with a pro-Palestinian protester who accused Israel of committing 'genocide' in Gaza during an event with students at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. This marked the first time Harris referred to the situation in Gaza by using the term. During the event, which took place last Thursday, Harris said, 'I am so invested in all of you, in every way' – at which point the pro-Palestinian student interrupted, asking, 'And in genocide, right? Billions of dollars in genocide. Billions of dollars in genocide.' ' I respect your right to speak. I’m speaking right now. I know what you’re speaking of. I want the cease-fire,' Harris said in response. The keffiyeh-wearing protester proceeded to shout: 'But what about the genocide?' and added as he was escorted out, '19,000 children are dead, and you won’t call it a genocide. Israel is committing genocide.' 'What he’s talking about, it’s real,' Harris told the audience after the man was escorted out. 'That’s not the subject that I came to discuss today but it’s real, and I respect his voice.' 'The statements made don’t reflect the position of the Biden-Harris administration or the vice president’s stance,' Harris’ representative later told Ynet. Her campaign sources added that Harris didn’t agree with the protester, and 'when security escorted him out, she made a general statement about the need to end the war, and expressed empathy for the genuine feelings that the issue evokes in many people after he left.' 'However, she didn’t agree with defining the war as a genocide, and she has not expressed such a stance in the past, as this is not her position,' the statement added. The statements of both Harris and Trump come a little over two weeks before the U.S. election on November 5, against the backdrop of the Biden administration's threats of a weapons embargo on Israel if it continues to block the transfer of American humanitarian aid to Gaza. Harris faced a setback last week after the American-Arab political lobby AAPAC announced it wouldn’t endorse any presidential candidate for the first time since its establishment in 1998, citing that 'both candidates blindly support Israel.'

Still functioning like an army': IDF turns Hezbollah's strength ...	The IDF Military Intelligence Directorate begins implementing new tool gathering real-time intelligence on organized Hezbollah cells in Lebanon, leading to fast and safe eliminations The IDF’s fighting in southern Lebanon highlights one of Hezbollah’s new key strengths, which it developed alongside the Russian military during the war in Syria over the last decade and a half. The IDF is now starting to exploit this strength, turning it into a vulnerability for the Shiite terror army. As daily clashes with IDF soldiers increase, the IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate has observed just how disciplined Hezbollah is, maintaining a strict military hierarchy even in areas where only small terror cells remain. Two and a half weeks into the ground operation, the military identified two main trends in the daily combat patterns of the IDF divisions operating along the border to combat the terror group. Hezbollah hasn’t launched significant company or platoon-level attacks against Israeli forces. Instead, it operates with small cells remaining in the frontline villages where the IDF is present, alongside anti-tank, rocket and mortar fire. Hundreds of Hezbollah operatives near the border are doing so under a structured operational pattern. They haven’t yet resorted to independent guerrilla warfare, as Hamas did in Gaza when the ground maneuver against it was bolstered. This means Hezbollah has, in some ways, given up on its frontline villages as launch points for a possible invasion of Israel. It keeps most of its tactical manpower – tens of thousands of armed operatives – in areas safe from a ground invasion in southern and central Lebanon, following the heavy blows delivered by the IDF during the opening strikes of Operation Northern Arrows. By doing so, Hezbollah is acting similarly to Hamas by conserving forces and capabilities for a protracted war, with a limited scale and varying pace. Former IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kochavi described the evolution of Hamas and Hezbollah from terrorist organizations to 'terror armies,' with battalions, brigades, special units, operational headquarters and force-building. Now, the signs of this evolution are clear: The IDF has observed that even small terror cells, composed of three to six armed operatives remaining in the border area, operate under a command hierarchy, even after most of the local company and battalion commanders have been eliminated. 'When they become completely disconnected, we'll see phenomena similar to the one in Gaza, where cells organize on their own and independently carry out attacks against IDF forces,' military sources said. 'It’s harder to operate against that, both from an intelligence and operational standpoint. For now, the fact they're still functioning like a military is beneficial for us.' Now, a new IDF operational intelligence tool is being used for the first time in Lebanon – FIU (Field Intelligence Units), which focuses on real-time, hourly intelligence tracking, targeting terror cells and organizations to support the forces on the ground. The intelligence officers and soldiers in these FIUs, most of them reservists, are stationed at a home front IDF Military Intelligence Directorate base but maintain an open line with battalion commanders, brigade commanders and their intelligence officers fighting on the Lebanese front. Each FIU unit, such as the one assigned to the Golani Brigade currently operating in Lebanon, has representatives from all areas of military intelligence: signals intelligence and eavesdropping, visual intelligence, human intelligence and other sources. They receive round-the-clock information from thousands of IDF sensors covering the village where the Golani Brigade is active. They rapidly process this information using advanced technologies and intelligence analysts, quickly generating alerts for the troops on the ground. According to the Military Intelligence Directorate, these real-time operational and intelligence mechanisms streaming from FIUs to the soldiers have led to the daily elimination of dozens of Hezbollah operatives, mainly airstrikes. 'We can now identify an ambush against an IDF force in southern Lebanon, which includes an anti-tank cell preparing to fire from 5 km away, followed by a barrage of rockets being set up 12 km away and possibly even an explosive they’ll try to detonate remotely,' military sources explained. 'The FIU teams immediately report this to the force on the ground, allowing the troops to prepare, protect themselves and counterattack the threat. These events have been happening daily in southern Lebanon over the past two weeks,' they added.

Sinwar's wife enters tunnel with luxury bag worth thousands of do...	IDF spokesperson in Arabic publishes online post showing Samar Abu Zamar with her husband, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, on the night before October 7 carrying $32,000 handbag IDF spokesperson in Arabic, Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, published a post on his X account on Saturday targeting Samar Abu Zamar, the wife of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The tweet claimed she was seen alongside her husband a day before the October 7 massacre carrying a Birkin bag from Hermes worth thousands of dollars. 'Did Sinwar's wife enter the tunnel with him on October 6 carrying a bag estimated to cost around $32,000?! I'll leave the answer to you,' Adraee wrote in the caption of a picture showing Abu Zamar holding the bag inside the tunnel where she and her husband took refuge the night before the massacre, alongside an image of the luxury bag from the company's website. 'While the residents of Gaza lack enough money for tents or basic supplies, we see many examples of Yahya Sinwar and his wife's unique love for money,' he added. To purchase the bag named after actress Jane Birkin, one must contact Hermes, which sells the coveted bags, in order to join a long waiting list. IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari revealed on Saturday footage of Sinwar and his family entering a Gaza tunnel before the start of the October 7 attack. 'On the night before the massacre, Sinwar was focused on his own survival and that of his family. In the video, you can see him and his family slipping into an underground bunker beneath their home on October 6, just hours before the attack,' he said. 'For hours, Sinwar and his son are seen moving supplies – food, a flat-screen television, mattresses –keeping the operation secret to minimize exposure,' Hagari added. Abu Zamar was born in Gaza in 1980 and holds a master's degree in religious studies from the Islamic University in the city, where she also worked as a lecturer until her marriage. Sinwar's wife belongs to a well-known and respected tribe among the Palestinians. Her family, the Abu Zamar family, is a religious family known for supporting 'popular resistance' (the Palestinian term for terrorist organizations) and actions against Israel. The family's roots are deeply embedded in the struggle against Israel. According to estimates, all of her family members have been recruited to Hamas, some of them to the terror group’s elite Nukhba unit. Abu Zamar and Sinwar got married on November 21, 2011, less than a month after he was released from Israeli prison as part of the deal to free kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011. Samar was 31 at the time of their wedding, an age considered quite old for marriage among women in Gaza, where the average marriage age for women is 20. Sinwar was 49 at the time, but the 18-year age gap didn’t seem to bother his intended. She understood it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to marry a significant and influential man in Gaza. Sinwar himself mentioned in a previous interview that he wasn't really involved in choosing his wife. 'While I was in the Holy Land (Saudi Arabia) performing the Hajj, my four sisters managed to find me a bride,' he said.

Libyan ISIS supporter planned attack on Israeli embassy in Berlin	Libyan asylum seeker, 28, arrested at his home in Berlin following information from a foreign intelligence service; Israeli ambassador to Germany: 'Further proof that we are on the frontline of the political battlefield' The German newspaper 'Bild' reported Saturday night that a Libyan national was arrested on suspicion of planning an attack on the Israeli embassy in Berlin. Special police forces stormed the house where the suspect lives in the city of Bernau north of Berlin in the state of Brandenburg. Security sources told the newspaper that the suspect, a 28-year-old Libyan national who is identified as an ISIS supporter, allegedly wanted to attack Israel's main diplomatic mission in Germany. It is still unclear if he was armed, and if he had access to weapons or explosives. A spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office said information about the planned attack was received from a foreign intelligence service. 'A suspect of membership in a foreign terrorist organization was arrested in Bernau. At the same time, witnesses were questioned in the city of St. Augustine near Bonn,' he said. Israel's ambassador to Germany, Ron Prosor, said following the young man's arrest: 'Muslim antisemitism has long been not only hateful rhetoric, but has led and encouraged terrorist activities around the world. This is another example of how Israeli embassies are on the frontline of the political battlefield. I wish to congratulate the law enforcement authorities in Germany who work around the clock to ensure the safety of the official representatives of the State of Israel.'

Israel cool to US renewed push for cease-fire after Sinwar's deat...	Biden and other US officials meet to discuss possible efforts to complete a hostage deal, taking advantage of the window of opportunity following the killing of Sinwar; Senior Israeli official: 'No substantial progress in talks until we finish with Iran' U.S. President Joe Biden held a meeting over the weekend on the issue of the Israeli hostages in Gaza and efforts to renew a deal following the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The meeting was attended by U.S. officials including National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, CIA Director William Burns, Biden's envoy to the Middle East Brett McGurk and others. McGurk spoke with the families of the hostages with U.S. citizenship following the meeting and informed them of the administration's strong determination to reach a 'breakthrough' and make progress in negotiations for a deal to free the hostages. The U.S. sees the elimination of Hamas’ leader as a golden opportunity to renew cease-fire talks and the Biden administration is committed to doing everything possible on this matter despite the political timetable of the November presidential elections. Both the U.S. and Israel are engaging in talks with mediators from Egypt and Qatar, trying to determine if negotiations with Hamas for a deal can continue at this time. Israel has expressed serious concerns about Hamas retaliating against the hostages for Sinwar’s death and has sent strong messages to the terror organization, warning them not to harm the captives. Despite the U.S.’s determination, however, it seems nothing significant will take place until Hamas is clear on its plans for Sinwar’s appointed successor. One option is that a committee of senior officials, rather than a single person, might take over, which could make negotiations for a deal easier. U.S. officials have said an agreement won't be reached if both sides remain firm on their conditions. However, a senior Israeli official claimed there won't be any significant progress or dramatic breakthrough in the hostage deal negotiations until the Israeli retaliation against Iran and its possible fallouts are through, as Sinwar's successors are unlikely to push for a deal before they’re sure a regional war won’t break out. Moving forward, actions could lead to a larger regional arrangement that would also consider the issue of the hostages. Mossad chief David Barnea is leading a proposal that calls for a cease-fire and a political resolution on the northern border to include the hostage issue as a term. Sinwar’s replacement does present an opportunity, as the mediators have openly said his elimination could provide a chance for positive change and facilitate a deal. However, an agreement won't happen until the situation between Israel and Iran is resolved.

US investigates leak of Pentagon documents on Israel’s plans to a...	Pentagon's classified documents were posted publicly online over the weekend and deal with Israel's preparations for an attack against Iran; 'The leak is very worrying,' an American official told CNN, which confirmed the documents are authentic The U.S. has opened an investigation into the leak of the Pentagon's classified documents that deal with Israel's preparations for an attack against Iran, three sources familiar with the details told CNN. One of them also confirmed to the network that the leaked documents are authentic. 'The leak is very worrying,' an American source told CNN. The documents were first published on Telegram, and at the end of the week they were posted online. According to the documents, dated October 15 and October 16, the Israeli Air Force recently conducted exercises and 'rehearsals' in preparation for an attack against Iran. The documents are attributed to the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency (GNA) and note that Israel continues to move military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. They were sharable within the 'Five Eyes,' which are the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The documents do not contain details or an overall picture of the targets of the attack, but rather general preparations for a long-range attack by the Air Force, which the intelligence professionals and the Revolutionary Guards Air Force could have assessed for themselves using the basic intelligence they already have. One of the documents states that, according to the analysis of various images, the Air Force conducted exercises with with air-launched ballistic missiles (ALBM), including at least 16 'Golden Horizon' missiles and 40 'Rocks' or ISO2 missiles. The documents also discuss 'covert drone activity' and extensive deployment drills. It also reports on 'secret UAV activity,' and claims that the Air Force conducted a 'second large-scale deployment exercise' between October 15 and 16. The report also states that, during those days, activity related to air-to-surface missiles (ASM) was observed at the Ramat David and Ramon Air Force Bases. Another leaked document, which allegedly contains an analysis by the NGA, reports that the IDF 'probably' also conducted an aerial refueling exercise on October 16, and contained a side note stating Israel's apparent ability to use UAVs in order to gather intelligence in Iran and 'across the region.' A U.S. official said that the investigation will examine who had access to the documents. CNN noted that the procedures state that any such leak immediately leads to an investigation by the FBI, along with the Pentagon and intelligence agencies. This could be a deliberate leak from the Pentagon, perhaps with the aim of fending off criticism from the progressive camp in the Democratic Party of the Biden administration for having no influence on Israel, and to show the American public - and also Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - that the U.S. actually has good control over the details. The leak also lends credibility to the statement Biden made in Berlin, that he has an understanding of how and when Israel was going to retaliate against missile attacks by Iran.

Military and political moves coordinated as Hezbollah strongholds...	Another reserve brigade goes into action Sunday; Senior IDF official believes that within 'days to weeks' the mission in southern Lebanon will be completed, and notes several positive developments for Israel The IDF is working 'vigorously and quickly' with the aim of finishing the work in the area near the border in southern Lebanon, as well as the plan to attack Hezbollah's fire and command and control arrays 'within days to weeks.' No more. 'We strive for a situation where our planned military closing moves will be conducted in parallel with the progress of the diplomatic processes that will lead to a settlement,' a senior military official told Ynet. The political processes have already begun, and the official noted the following developments, all of which are positive from Israel's point of view: 1. Hezbollah and the Iranians want a cease-fire as soon as possible in order to preserve as much of their remaining capabilities as they can, and so that they can quickly reestablish themselves as a military-political force within Lebanon. 2. In the last few days, there was a rare public gathering of central political leaders and heads of sects in Lebanon: Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, who until recently was coordinating positions with Hezbollah; the leader of the Shiite Amal movement and the Speaker of the Parliament Nabih Berri; and the Sunni prime minister Sunni of Lebanon, Najib Mikati. Everyone called for a cease-fire and a political settlement without mentioning Hezbollah's demands and demands. 3. Mikati even came out publicly against Iran's interference in Lebanon's internal affairs, which he would not have done when Hezbollah and Nasrallah were in their usual position of power. On Sunday, an additional reserve brigade is entering southern Lebanon to complete the clearing of the villages and fortified areas where Hezbollah's Radwan force prepared its logistical infrastructure and bases for infiltration into Israel. Every house in the village that had weapons in or under it will be destroyed, the senior military official said, and this will leave a great deal of destruction in the Shiite villages near the border.

IDF soldier succumbs to wounds sustained in southern Lebanon comb...	Sergeant Major (res.) Yishai Netanel Greenbaum critically wounded in battle on October 9; 'The world lost a precious soul today,' his widow Hadas says The IDF reported Saturday night that Sergeant Major (res.) Yishai Netanel Greenbaum, 38, a platoon sergeant in the 288 Brigade's 5030th Battalion, from Lod, has succumbed to wounds sustained in combat in southern Lebanon. Greenbaum was critically wounded on October 9. Earlier, the IDF reported that Staff Sergeant Ofir Berkovich, 20, from Modi'in Maccabim Reut, and Sergeant Elishai Young, 19, from Dimona, both of the 401st Brigade's 52nd Armored Battalion, were killed in battle in the northern Gaza Strip. Since the beginning of the war, the IDF's death toll has reached 748, with 355 fatalities during the ground operations in Gaza. Greenbaum was also a social worker who specialized in treating trauma-affected soldiers, a role he continued during his reserve service as a combat soldier. In the battle where Greenbaum was wounded, fellow reservist Sergeant Major (res.) Ronny Ganizate was killed. Before the official IDF announcement, Greenbaum’s wife, Hadas, shared the news on social media, writing, 'With a broken and shattered heart, I must announce the passing of my beloved and heroic husband, Yishai Greenbaum. Yishai fell in defense of the homeland he so loved. The world lost a precious soul today. Thank you to the family and all who have supported us with your thoughts and prayers.' In a note reflecting on his reserve duty earlier this year, Greenbaum described balancing his dual roles as platoon sergeant and social worker during 150 days of service. 'Like many other reservists, I was called up on October 7 to serve in a battalion tasked with defensive missions in the north. The tension, the risks and the long days added another undefined role for me,' he wrote. Greenbaum recounted how he switched between military and social work duties, offering both operational leadership and emotional support. 'As a sergeant, I checked on wet gear during rainy nights. As a social worker, I ensured each soldier had a blanket and emphasized that every buddy checks on his friend. After mortar fire, as a sergeant, I led the troops to safety. As a social worker, I provided water and encouraging words to everyone.' He concluded his reflection by noting, 'The period ended, but the war continues. My reserve duty left me thinking about the place of both roles in my life. It seems the whole country needs more of the social worker’s role—strengthening our forces and healing from trauma.' 'An extraordinary individual' The Ramat Gan Hesder Yeshiva, where Greenbaum studied, mourned his death, describing him as having 'fallen a hero in battle in Lebanon.' In a statement, the yeshiva added, 'May we witness the vengeance for the blood of Your servants.' Yeshiva head Rabbi Yehoshua Shapira said, 'Yishai was a leader, both strong and gentle. He was a kind, compassionate person, an amazing father who spent quality time with his family, and a social worker who helped soldiers prepare for hardships. He was both gentle and steadfast, an extraordinary individual. We pray that his sacrifice for the nation will hasten redemption and that his soul will rest near the divine throne.' Lod Mayor Yair Revivo noted that Greenbaum worked in the city's welfare department, saying, 'Yishai loved this land, and his sole desire was to defeat the enemy so that we could live securely in Israel. We embrace his wife, Hadas, and their children, and we will provide any support they need. City staff have been supporting the family since his injury and even more so after his passing.' The Welfare Ministry expressed deep sorrow over Greenbaum's death, saying, 'Yishai was a dedicated social worker in the Lod municipality and a reservist who went to defend the residents of northern Israel and all the citizens of the country. We send our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Hadas, his children, family, colleagues at the social services department, and all who loved him.'

Radwan forces fled and we’re in their houses, destroying them at...	In a vast underground command center, real-time footage tracks IDF operations in Lebanon; while communication systems relay multiple incidents along the border, personnel inside the bunker remain calm and composed A little caption appeared on one of the screens at 12:11 p.m. reading, 'Kiryat Yam, Kiryat Haim and Shmuel, Haifa – Bay.' This was followed by a string of further alerts in Kiryat Motzkin, Kiryat Bialik, Haifa – West, Haifa – Carmel, the Home Front Command sending automated messages online and onto apps. This is a great drama for those suddenly hearing the sirens wailing, quickly getting themselves to shelters and hearing explosion blasts, interceptions and crashes. But here, in the earth’s belly in the Northern Command pit, this is yet one more incident occurring in tandem with several dozen others. The wall facing dozens of people sitting deep within Mount Canaan is covered with a huge screen divided into dozens of squares, with something going on in each square. Remotely manned aircraft escorting the ground forces in Lebanese territory are broadcasting the live, up-to-date picture. Each force has its own aircraft escorting it in the sky, so you can simultaneously view several broadcasts from different battle sites. The digital map displays the forces’ locations and movements, and on the adjacent screen, a real-time update of the evacuation of wounded soldiers from inside Lebanon, bringing them for medical treatment in Israel. What’s going on on the home front, another piece of the puzzle - a piece for which the Home Command is responsible. A few hours later, at one of the crash sites in Kiryat Yam, you realize the huge discrepancy between the calm composure required in the bunker in Safed, a site protected from attack allowing people down there to carry on running the war, and the fear and anxiety that comes with hearing the sirens outside. There’s a little screen in the command pit broadcasting a Hebrew TV channel, the channel switching every few minutes. It’s on mute, and you just see the pictures from the crash site, interviews with dazed residents and the images of the damage and destruction. On another screen, an Israeli Air Force (IAF) aircraft follows a vehicle traveling on a dirt path somewhere in southern Lebanon, driving though orchards, turning left and carrying on straight. And the black and white picture, constantly homing in on it , momentarily making you forget about the drama that very moment in the Haifa Bay. Only when we see the little small shopping center on the corner of Jerusalem and Jabotinsky Boulevards, and with our own eyes, see the torn blinds, shattered windows and air-conditioning units torn off buildings, do we understand what happened here. A rocket that landed on the roof of Birkat Moshe bakery, has torn a hole through a layer of concrete and iron bars. Dozens of windows are shattered, and air-conditioning units torn off three buildings above the shopping center. The bakery owner, Eliran Assouline, says that he heard three consecutive sirens. 'Our safe room is at the back, inside the kitchen. We all got in. As soon as the sirens stopped, instead of waiting for ten minutes, I went out to check, and then I heard a huge explosion followed by a blast and I was hurled into the air.' Meir Ohayon, who owns the Beshem Ha’omanut tattoo parlor, a smiley guy with Rastafarian locks and a big tattoo of Salvador Dali on his arm, saw Assouline go flying. 'What’s that flying? I saw him hit by the biggest blast ever. He was like a meter into the air and two meters back. Like in the movies, he left the ground and went flying. I was just running to the shelter when the missile hit the roof and there was a massive explosion. Everything went black, the concrete went flying, bits of plaster were flying around. There was loads of smoke. It was crazy I tell you.' Haka's hill Not far from the pit, stands a battered old Willys jeep that served Maj. Gen, Yitzhak (Haka) Hofi, commander of the Northern Command in the Yom Kippur War. The base commander was then stationed in the fortress building in Nazareth (which now serves as the police’s northern HQ), too far away from the IDF’s battles staving off Syria’s surprise invasion of the Golan Heights. Back then, there weren’t any LED screens or planes remotely controlled from a hundred miles away from the front, broadcasting pictures of the war. Hofi had to jump into the jeep and find a position from which he could see the Golan Heights, and manage the front from there. Mt. Canaan above Safed was the perfect spot. Brig. Gen. (res.) Shuki Shahrur, 67, was only a 16-year-old boy at the time, but later enlisted and advanced in the army, serving as an operations officer, staff wing officer and the Northern Command’s chief of staff. In the past 20 years, he’s spent more time at the command base in Safed than at home. Following the 1973 war, it was decided to transfer the command headquarters from Nazareth to Mt. Canaan,' he says. 'I watched all the work setting up the command pit. They dug deep down into the mountain, and inserted kilometers of electric cables, air and water pipes. They started in 1979 and finished 11 years later. I had the honor of being the first to operate the pit as the command’s operations officer. Knowing this pit extremely well, I can say that it’s constantly undergoing the most advanced technological adjustments.' 'Down there, there’s a dining room, a gym, a clinic, a synagogue and barracks. These are huge spaces, interconnected by corridors and in the central areas, you can see the side of the mountain into which this the complex was dug. There are independent energy centers allowing for command continuity if, Heaven forbid, the whole business above ground is out of use.' None of this guarantees anything, certainly not winning the war. Impressive as this place might be, it’s a merely a technical matter allowing for ongoing management of this long war, with no end in sight. Almost all of the Hezbollah leadership has been assassinated. Radwan, Hezbollah's offensive force, has been severely hit, and the IDF is attacking from the air in Beirut and Bekaa, and on the ground in Lebanon. Four divisions have been assigned to the limited ground operation in southern Lebanon - a huge force of 11 brigades including six reservist brigades. And still, when we went down into the pit, sirens were sounding across the Galilee. Hezbollah is keeping up its missile and rocket firing capabilities, averaging 200 launches per day, enough to completely disrupt daily life. Fighter jets on standby We were asked to wait in a side room. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was just arriving for a visit. He sat down in front of a wall of screens, waited for his team to set up a camera who then filmed a video clip, later disseminated to all news outlets. 'Hezbollah is an organization with no head,' he said as those present watched the screens. 'Nasrallah has been assassinated, probably his successor too. A year into the war, and Hamas has been taken apart, Hezbollah a battered organization.' Two hours later, over 100 rockets were launched at Haifa and the bay area. But at the end of the day, when we put aside these boisterous statements, the technology and this impressive installation, we’re left with people. People keeping up a calm professional atmosphere, even with a firestorm raging outside. When one of the forces encounters a Hezbollah cell in a village in Lebanon, Lt. Col. Yuval Mazuz, the command’s operations officer, oversees managing the incident. We have two terrorists killed, and two of our forces wounded, requiring immediate evacuation. 'Immediate evacuation' means that the injury’s severity is moderate and up. A tank covers the evacuation while a remotely controlled aircraft covers all of this from the air. There’s also a combat helicopter not far, in case they need to launch a missile, and at the upper level there’s also a fighter jet ready to drop heavier munitions. Mazuz assumed the position in July 2023. Just before going down into the command pit in Safed, he passed the command baton for the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion onto his colleague, the late Lt. Col. Tomer Greenberg. 'Passing over the role between two battalion commanders is a very intimate matter' he says. 'You sit down with your successor for hours on end, sharing commitments about personnel scheduling, dilemmas and your experiences commanding the battalion. We had plenty of meetings talking about the complexities around family life, about how you’re hardly home.' Then came October 7. The war caught the 13th Battalion in operations in the Gaza border region, where the Nahal Oz outpost is located. The battalion lost 41 officers and soldiers in Hamas’ surprise attack and the battles they fought reconquering the outposts and communities. The battalion wasn’t broken, and Greenberg prepared it for ground operations inside Gaza. Greenberg was killed in Shijaiyah just before 6 p.m. on December 12. Nine more officers and soldiers fell alongside Greenberg, including two company commanders from the brigade. At the time, Mazuz was in the command pit in the north in consultations with the general. 'I left my phone above, so I couldn’t be contacted. It then turned out that the brigade had been trying to get hold of me. They also called my wife to find me and she sent me loads of WhatsApp messages for me to get back to her,' he said. Mazuz was in Gaza by midnight of that day. His temporary appointment as company battalion carried into two and a half months, in which time he fought in Shijaiyah and the refugee camps in central Gaza. When appointed as permanent battalion commander after Greenberg was killed, he asked to focus on the fighting in Lebanon. 'This is what I’m dealing with right now' he says. 'Defeating our enemy.' Thirty seconds to get to a shelter As these lines are written, the north is still being bombarded. A little after one o’clock in the afternoon, sirens are again sounding in Haifa and the bay area. Shortly thereafter, the IDF spokesperson announced that two civilians were killed by a rocket in Kiryat Shmona. The command base has also been struck. Last February, a rocket hit the base, killing lookout Staff Sgt. Omer Benjo. There were almost daily sirens in Safed. The city itself is of no interest to Hezbollah. Their target is the command center. Improbable as it may sound, despite the city being targeted in the Second Lebanon War by Hezbollah’s efforts to hit the Northern Command base, Safed is not prepared for rocket fire, and most of the homes do not have safe rooms. 'If you’d have told me before that this is how much Hezbollah manages to fire, while the IDF is conducting ground operations in its territory, killing its men and severely damaging its infrastructure, commanders and arsenals, I’d have said you were on drugs.' Yitav Haddad, whose home is on the command fence on Netz Street, lives in a home with a wife, three children and no safe room. The neighborhood bomb shelter is over 30 seconds’ run away with three toddlers. 'We live over the pit,' he says, pointing at the home’s floor. 'No one thought to protect us. The Home Front Command toured the neighborhood and one of the officers said that we deserve three mobile shelters. That was over a month ago. As you see, this road hasn’t been given even one mobile shelter. I invite you to come stay with us and wait for the siren. Maybe a rocket or fragments from an interception will crash down, and then you’ll feel how our house shakes, nearly falling down from the force of the blasts.' Mazuz explains about proportion. 'I’m not playing down 200 rockets fired a day. This is clearly serious, and we can’t reconcile ourselves to it. But we must remember what the predictions were for a war with Hezbollah. Our estimates were for much more massive, broader and deeper fire. If you’d have told me before that this is how much Hezbollah manages to fire, while the IDF is conducting ground operations in its territory, killing its men and severely damaging its infrastructure, commanders and arsenals, I’d have said you were on drugs.' Maj. Gen (res.) Annan Abbas, control wing chief in the command pit, wants us to take some air for a moment. We met him after he’d finished managing an incident in which a Hezbollah drone hit a border outpost in the Margaliot sector, injuring four soldiers. 'Listen, carefully,' he says. 'I live the area. I was born and raised here and, as a local, I know how much the residents by the border area are afraid of Hezbollah’s capabilities. Whenever the army sends up flares suspecting an infiltration, the local people panic. Every incident on the fence makes the local people panic. The Radwan Force has put out propaganda videos, done stunts on motorbikes and threatened to conquer the Galilee. In practice, the very opposite has happened. Radwan forces fled, retreated from the confrontation line and we’re in their houses, destroying them at every altercation.' 'Commander, this is Dad' Abbas certainly is a character. The guy’s a Sphynx. He sits at the central post in the pit with special sports glasses protecting his left eye, injured during his service in the Druze Special Forces. Not a muscle in his face moved as the communication systems simultaneously relayed a series of different dramatic incidents in various sectors along the border fence. He's 51, from Peki'in. His wife, Layla, is the village high school’s prinicpal. Their eldest son, Gideon, was a squad commander in the elite Egoz Unit and was discharged following a severe training injury. He has since been serving as a reservist with his father in the command pit. His middle son Jamal served commanding the Paratroopers’ 101st Battalion’s 3rd company. He’s an impressive, good-looking guy. His father proudly shows me pictures on his phone. On the eve of the war, Jamal surprised his family, coming home for short leave. He went out with his friends to Tiberias on Friday night and stayed over to sleep at one of their homes. The following day, when Hamas took Israel by surprise on the Gaza border, Annan, the father, quickly donned his uniform and rushed to the command pit in the north. 'That’s my go-to response in an emergency,' he says. 'Putting on my uniform, and going down to my post in the command pit.' He didn’t get a chance to see his son come home, pack his bags and rush down south where he joined the battles fighting Hamas terrorists. Just before he set out, the young, 17-year-old daughter, Mirelle photographed him. Standing at the doorway, she caught him arranging his bag on his back. He’s already got his gun on him. The mother, with her back to the camera, is watching him get ready. Moments later he was in his car and off. Three weeks later, the evening before going into Gaza, on October 29, Jamal called his father. 'It was 1:30 a.m. I’d just come back from the command center,' the father says. 'Jamal sounded excited. He said they were about to go in, and that he’s sending a message to the soldiers’ parents telling them this is a just war, and that he’ll do everything to protect their children, his soldiers. He told me something that rings is my head to this day. 'Dad, this is an existential war for the country, and in existential wars people get killed, and maybe I won’t return from this war. And if I don’t come back, you must be proud of me.' I’m having this conversation at 1:30 a.m. after a long day in the pit. 'I answered. 'Forget your nonsense. Take care of yourself and of your soldiers. There are a lot of tunnels beneath your feet in Gaza. Don’t be reckless,' I said to him. 'Don’t be reckless' because I know him. He had no fear. My boy was a galloping horse, a spirited fighter. He calmly answered, 'Dad, I understand the situation. I have a D9 and I have tanks. I have dogs and I have the Air Force. We’ll do everything slowly. I’ve promised their parents to bring their children back healthy and in one piece.' The days passed, and reports of the bitter battles in the Gaza Strip at the start of the ground operations wracked the father’s nerves. He tried getting hold of Jamal on Vered Harim, the IDF’s encrypted phone, but he wasn’t answering. He tried contacting his son’s command post by walkie-talkie – to no avail. They made contact on November 15, Wednesday evening. 'I was just about to leave the pit for home with my son Gideon, and two guys suddenly call me. ‘Hang on, one minute, we’ve got a surprise for you. You’re now going to talk to Jamal on the walkie-talkie.’ He was in some hole in Gaza and we were in a bunker underneath Safed. The conversation was published a few days later, by which time the family was in mourning. Annan: 'Commander, this is Dad.' Jamal: 'Continue.' Annan: 'Dad and Gideon send you their love. You are the fighters’ spearhead. Take care of yourselves. Strike Hamas. Destroy them. Fight fiercely, and wisely. Respond faster than the enemy. Stay there inside as long as it takes, until victory. We miss you and love you very much. Come back in peace. We, the Northern Command and your family, support you. Look after yourselves. Come back in peace. We’ll see you.' Jamal: 'Thank you very much.' Annan: 'Thank you, thank you. Take care of yourself. We’ll be in touch.' Jamal: 'No problem, dear father.' Three days passed and, on Saturday, during a shift in the pit, the Northern Command chief Ori Gordin’s secretary came in and asked him to accompany her. 'I was in my spot,' he says, pointing at his post in the pit – the control officer’s position. 'She comes in and says to me, ‘The general wants you to go up to his office.' It’s one floor above us, here in the pit. She said he wanted to consult with me. ‘I don’t know what it’s about.’ When I went into his room, he immediately got up, came up to me and hugged me saying, ‘I’m sorry to tell you that Jamal was killed in clashes in Sheikh Ijlin in Gaza.’' We stood at his position in the pit in silence. What’s left to say in such a situation? The screen was displaying a big slide reading 'situation picture.' A tear drew out of his healthy eye. The screen to the side read '12:45 – Kiryat Bialik Industrial Zone.'

IDF releases footage of Sinwar slipping into tunnel before Octobe...	Clip shows Hamas leader and family transporting supplies into tunnel before attack on southern Israel; 'Hamas leaders prioritize their own survival over the lives of Gaza’s residents,' Hagari says The IDF on Saturday released video footage showing Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar the night before the October 7 massacre, carrying supplies to a hideout. IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari revealed new details about the pursuit of Sinwar, who was killed last Wednesday, including how close he was to Israeli hostages during the manhunt. 'This evening, we are sharing footage from the IDF and Shin Bet’s pursuit of Yahya Sinwar,' Hagari said. 'We tracked his actions in the hours leading up to the massacre to understand his escape route. On the night before the massacre, Sinwar was focused on his own survival and that of his family. In the video, you can see him and his family slipping into an underground bunker beneath their home on October 6, just hours before the attack. For hours, Sinwar and his son are seen moving supplies—food, a flat-screen television, mattresses—keeping the operation secret to minimize exposure.' Sinwar, Hagari said, had constructed an underground fortress in Khan Younis, where he hid and directed the attack. 'In February, IDF forces entered Khan Younis and located the path where he had been hiding. We found an underground complex with living quarters, showers, beds, safes and uniforms. Several times, our forces were just moments away from catching him.' The hideout was fully equipped, with televisions, food, sofas and communication devices. 'We knew he had been there because we found his DNA on a tissue he used,' Hagari said, adding that the hideout was just a few hundred yards from the tunnel where six hostages were executed in late August. 'Sinwar spent most of his time underground between Khan Younis and Rafah, only emerging to flee.' Hagari also provided details on Sinwar’s final moments. 'IDF and Shin Bet forces continued their operations above and below ground to capture Sinwar until he made a mistake. In the incident last Wednesday, forces engaged terrorists, who began fleeing to two nearby buildings. Sinwar escaped alone into one of them. Our forces fired at the building you see in the footage. This was the first time Sinwar, who had been hiding underground for a year, faced Israeli forces—and it was the moment he was killed.' The operation marked the conclusion of a relentless pursuit of Sinwar, whom Hagari described as the architect of the brutal October 7 massacre. 'Tonight’s revelations once again demonstrate that Hamas leaders, wherever they are, prioritize their own survival over the lives of Gaza’s residents. Sinwar was a wanted terrorist who hid while war raged around him.' When asked if Sinwar's death improved conditions for a potential hostage deal, Hagari said, 'Our mission is to create the conditions for the hostages’ return. There’s no doubt that Sinwar’s elimination aids that goal.' Regarding Israel's objectives in Gaza and humanitarian aid distribution, Hagari added, 'We operate under political directives, including facilitating the entry of 250 trucks into Gaza, and we will continue as instructed.'

Driver killed by Hezbollah rocket near Acre identified as Alexei ...	Victim, 50, reportedly pulled his car to the side of the road and was critically injured by shrapnel to his upper body; his passenger, who ducked and shielded his head, sustained only minor injuries The driver killed on saturday by Hezbollah rocket shrapnel on Highway 22 near Acre has been identified as Alexei Popov, 50, from Kiryat Haim. Popov sustained injuries to his upper body, while a friend traveling with him in the car was lightly injured. Hours after the incident, police officers arrived at Popov’s home to notify his wife of his death. A family friend noted that Popov had no other relatives in Israel, and his two children live in Ukraine. Neighbors told Ynet that Popov had been returning from grocery shopping when he was killed. 'I heard screams and crying from their apartment upstairs and realized they had informed his wife of his death,' said Maria, a neighbor. 'They were a wonderful couple, always together. She had recently traveled to Ukraine to visit her new grandchild, and he missed her terribly, waiting for her to return.' Popov was pronounced dead at the scene. 'We arrived and saw a car on the side of the road, heavily damaged by shrapnel. The windows were shattered, and nearby stores were also damaged,' Magen David Adom paramedic Alex Motskin said. According to the paramedic, Popov's friend recounted that they had pulled over when the siren sounded, but the explosion occurred before Popov could exit the vehicle. 'The passenger ducked down and shielded his head. He emerged from the car fully conscious, with a minor shrapnel wound near his ear. Unfortunately, the driver was critically injured in the upper body, and we pronounced him dead shortly after.'

US wants to see Israel scale back some of Beirut strikes, Austin ...	The United States would like to see Israel scale back some of its strikes in and around the Lebanese capital of Beirut, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Saturday. 'The number of civilian casualties have been far too high,' he told reporters at a G7 defense gathering in the Italian city of Naples. 'We'd like to see Israel scale back on some of the strikes it's taking, especially in and around Beirut, and we'd like to see things transition to some sort of negotiation that will allow civilians on both sides of the border to return to their homes.' Tens of thousands of people have fled Beirut's southern suburbs - once a densely populated zone that also housed Hezbollah offices and underground installations - since Israel began regularly targeting the zone approximately three weeks ago. On Saturday afternoon, Israel carried out heavy strikes on several locations in the city's southern suburbs, leaving thick plumes of smoke wafting over the city horizon throughout the evening. The strikes came as Hezbollah fired salvos of rockets at northern Israel, with one drone directed at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's holiday home, his spokesman said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy5wm0011eyl	2024-10-19T10:58:15-07:00

This will not stop me or Israel from continuing our fight for security,' PM says; property damage assessors evaluate damage at Netanyahu's residence following drone strike Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran-backed forces of attempting to assassinate him and his wife Sara after a drone launched from Lebanon targeted his private residence in Caesarea on Saturday. 'Iran's proxies who tried to assassinate me and my wife today made a grave mistake,' Netanyahu said. He vowed that the incident would not deter Israel from its mission. 'This will not stop me or Israel from continuing our fight for security,' he said. 'I say to Iran and its partners in the axis of evil: anyone who harms Israeli citizens will pay a heavy price. We will continue to eliminate your terrorists, bring our captives home from Gaza, and secure the north. We will achieve our war objectives and change the security reality for generations. Together we fight, and with God's help, together we will win.' A preliminary investigation revealed that the helicopter that detected the drone failed to identify it, leading to sirens being activated only in military areas and not in Caesarea. The drone, which was recorded on social media, struck a building near Netanyahu's home. Following the strike, security forces, bomb squads and emergency teams rushed to the scene, including property damage assessors from the Israel Tax Authority. Hezbollah launched three drones toward Netanyahu's residence, with two intercepted. The third was not detected until it hit the building, without triggering alarms. Netanyahu and his family were not at the residence at the time, and according to his office, the prime minister had not been there for the past week. However, neighbors reported seeing a convoy leaving the compound earlier in the day.

IDF names 2 soldiers killed in battle in northern Gaza	SST. Ofir Berkovich, 20, from Modi'in Maccabim Reut, and SGT. Elishai Young, 19, from Dimona, both of the 401st Brigade's 52nd Armored Battalion, fell fighting in Jabaliya; IDF death toll in war reaches 747 The IDF reported on Saturday evening that Staff Sergeant Ofir Berkovich, 20, from Modi'in Maccabim Reut, and Sergeant Elishai Young, 19, from Dimona, both of the 401st Brigade's 52nd Armored Battalion, were killed in battle in the northern Gaza Strip. Another 52nd Battalion officer was seriously wounded in the same incident. Additionally, another officer from the 53rd Battalion of the 188th Brigade was seriously wounded earlier Saturday by a drone strike in northern Israel. Since the beginning of the war, the IDF's death toll has reached 747, with 355 fatalities during the ground operations in Gaza. The IDF's ground campaign in Jabaliya is ongoing, as part of efforts to prevent Hamas from regrouping. IDF Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee shared footage of Gazan civilians evacuating the Jabaliya area, attributing the exodus to the 'breaking of the fear barrier of Yahya Sinwar,' the elusive Hamas leader eliminated by Israeli forces on Thursday. He said that 'hundreds of civilians have begun to evacuate, with the IDF ensuring their safe passage through designated routes.' Adraee also reported the capture of several terrorists in the area, some of whom were found with weapons magazines, while one carried a letter expressing his desire to die as a martyr. Reuters reported on Saturday that Israel has 'tightened the siege' around hospitals in Jabaliya. Local residents and medical sources claimed that Israeli forces were 'bombarding homes and blocking the entry of medical and food supplies.' Earlier, the IDF announced that Givati Brigade combat teams had joined the 162nd Division in operations in the Jabaliya area. According to the IDF, division forces eliminated several terrorists in close-quarters combat, with the support of air force strikes. In central Gaza, the 252nd Division directed airstrikes that destroyed military sites used by Hamas for sniper attacks and the placement of explosives. In Rafah, Nahal Brigade combat teams, under Gaza Division command, eliminated two terrorist cells threatening Israeli forces. Additionally, IDF units from the Bislach Brigade combat team engaged and killed armed terrorists during an exchange of fire.

Hezbollah leadership filled with unknown figures, report says	Israeli official tells New York Times terror group promoted lower-ranking operatives to lead new command center coordinating rocket and drone attacks; IDF resumes strikes in Beirut’s Dahieh, destroys Radwan force underground base Hezbollah has replenished its ranks of commanders and key leadership positions with operatives whose names were previously unknown to Israel, an Israeli official told The New York Times on Saturday. In an in-depth report, the official explained that these individuals were once lower-level commanders, which has allowed Hezbollah to continue fighting Israel despite heavy losses. The Lebanese terrorist group, which has faced a series of major blows since September, scored notable successes this week, including a deadly drone strike on a Golani Brigade training base, the launch of a drone toward the residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Caesarea and the killing of five Golani soldiers in southern Lebanon. The group also carried out rocket barrages on the Haifa area, resulting in one civilian death. Another incident involved an attempt to abduct an IDF commando, highlighting Hezbollah’s gradual recovery on the battlefield. While these actions fall short of Israel's pre-war expectations, they signal a troubling shift after Hezbollah's diminished capabilities in recent months. According to a Reuters report last week, Hezbollah is preparing for a protracted war of attrition in southern Lebanon. The group's military leadership has been nearly wiped out, but a new command structure has taken over, directing rocket fire and combat operations. Sources within Hezbollah also told Reuters that the group still possesses a significant stockpile of weapons, including precision-guided missiles that have yet to be deployed. Western diplomats have expressed concern that Israel’s limited operation in Lebanon may escalate into a prolonged war, urging Israel to leverage its successes to secure a deal that distances Hezbollah from the border. Following the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut's Dahieh district, Hezbollah established a new operations center within 72 hours, enabling terrorists in southern Lebanon to continue rocket launches and combat under direct orders. A Hezbollah field commander said the group’s fighters are acting 'according to front-line capabilities,' with the new leadership operating in complete secrecy. The commander described the current command structure as a 'small circle' with direct contact with the battlefield. In response to Hezbollah's actions, the IDF resumed airstrikes on Beirut’s Dahieh district on Saturday, marking the first strikes since Wednesday, after a six-day halt reportedly at the request of U.S. President Joe Biden. The attacks followed evacuation warnings issued to certain buildings, with extensive damage reported. The IDF also targeted the previously untouched town of Jounieh, north of Beirut, where a strike on a vehicle killed two people, one of whom was identified by Arab media as a 'military commander in Hezbollah intelligence.' Since the Israeli ground operation in southern Lebanon began, IDF forces have cleared several villages, engaging Hezbollah terrorists in close combat. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi estimates that approximately 1,500 Hezbollah fighters have been killed so far, describing the figure as a 'conservative estimate.' The IDF also announced on Saturday that it destroyed a central underground command post of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force using over 100 tons of explosives. The operation involved 8th Brigade forces and the Combat Engineering Corps' elite Yahalom Unit. The facility contained weapons storage, living quarters and other resources for prolonged occupation. 'We stand on the ruins of a Hezbollah tunnel that was intended for an attack on Galilee communities,' Galilee Division Commander Brig. Gen. Shai Klaper said after the operation.' 'The 8th Division, 91st Division and the Yahalom Unit did outstanding work here, leaving no trace of the tunnel. This area is completely devastated. In the nearby village, which has been transformed into a military stronghold, it is now uninhabitable. Wherever Hezbollah attempts this, we will destroy them to the end.' Thousands of rockets and more than 1,000 drones According to Ynet military correspondent Ron Ben-Yishai, Hezbollah still retains a significant arsenal of thousands of short- and medium-range rockets and missiles, including precision-guided ones, posing a persistent threat to Israel. However, the group may feel it is nearing the limit of what it can achieve through these means. In contrast, the potential of explosive-laden drones—essentially small cruise missiles—remains largely untapped. While Hezbollah has spoken about deploying 'drone swarms,' it has yet to launch more than five drones simultaneously against a single target. We can expect Hezbollah to ramp up its use of explosive drones, as they are harder to detect and intercept when flying low over the terrain, and they offer greater precision. Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea is a relatively easy target for Hezbollah, given its known and publicized location. A drone flying low over the sea from Lebanon could potentially reach it without being detected, and even if spotted, it would be difficult to intercept. In Saturday morning's attack, Hezbollah’s drone operators were accurate in their planning, but fortunately, the drones did not hit or come close to Netanyahu’s family, who were not at their Caesarea home at the time. This wasn't a matter of luck but rather a reflection of Hezbollah’s operators and intelligence failing to execute effectively. Given Hezbollah’s capacity to learn and adapt, we must be better prepared for the next attempt. This incident also highlighted a new phenomenon: sirens in certain areas without simultaneous alerts from the Home Front Command app. This is part of a new policy aimed at addressing the increased use of drones by Hezbollah, as well as by Shia militias from Iraq and Syria. The policy involves issuing warnings in areas with potential military or civilian targets even if the drones pose no immediate danger but might follow a projected flight path toward these locations. This shift came after the deadly strike on the Golani base, where the drone evaded interception attempts by planes, helicopters and Iron Dome systems. The downside of this policy is the increased frequency of alerts, which forces residents in affected areas to seek shelter more often. On the bright side, there are promising developments in the pipeline for better detection, interception and the ability to strike drones at their launch sites.

Memory as his weapon: The inspiring story of Matan, blinded in Ga...	A year after losing his sight from critical injuries near Gaza, Matan Levy fulfilled his dream of becoming a lawyer; now interning at the Tel Aviv District Attorney’s Office, he says, 'I can’t fight on the battlefield, so I fight crime in the courtroom' This is the remarkable story of Matan Levy, an IDF soldier who lost his sight but refused to give up. Today, he is fulfilling his dream of serving his country as a legal intern at the Tel Aviv District Attorney's Office. On the morning of October 7, Levy, from the town of Oranit in central Israel, received a call from his reserve unit, the 5th Brigade’s 8111st Battalion, instructing him to report immediately to the Gaza border. At the time, Levy was completing an internship at a private law firm, having recently finished his law degree. But in the Gaza border region, his life changed forever. 'We were tasked with clearing the area of terrorists,' he recalled. 'There were tough encounters and intense events. After a few days, we transitioned to providing security for the artillery and tank units preparing for the ground offensive.' On October 14, while stationed near Kibbutz Nirim, a mortar barrage launched from Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun hit his unit. 'I was critically wounded, and my friend, Israeli hero Omer Bitan, was killed by the mortar,' Levy recalled. For two weeks, Levy lay in the ICU at Soroka Medical Center in Be’er Shva, hovering between life and death. 'After two weeks in a coma, I woke up and quickly realized I was blind,' he said. 'But the pain was so intense that I didn't focus on the blindness. The pain was so severe that I can't even describe it—it terrified me.' Levy underwent extensive rehabilitation at Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv, spending nine months in the hospital. As the pain subsided, he began to process the reality of his blindness. 'I had to relearn everything—how to walk, how to navigate a world I couldn't see. Simple daily tasks became monumental challenges. It's a difficulty someone who can see wouldn't understand.' Despite his ordeal, Levy was determined not to give up on his dream of becoming a lawyer. 'During my rehabilitation, I decided I would continue to fight for the country, and I wanted to do my legal internship at the State Attorney's Office.' The matter reached the state attorney himself, who requested the Tel Aviv District Attorney's Office (Criminal Division) to consider his candidacy. Levy was invited for an interview, preparing for it while still in rehab. 'It was the first time I dealt with legal materials without being able to see them, thanks to my amazing brother, who continues to help me.' 'While others can read through the material multiple times, I rely on my memory. My assistants read the material to me once or twice, and I memorize it.' Levy’s family—his parents and brother—were devastated by his blindness, but his mother, who had immigrated to Israel from Argentina for Zionist reasons, was a pillar of strength. 'My family was crushed, but my mother, a true lioness, reminded us all that nothing is stronger than life itself. The fact that I survived is a miracle, and that message stuck with me,' he said. His persistence paid off. He was accepted into the office and joined a team dealing with serious crime under Attorney Assaf Shavit and his mentor, Attorney Simi Yafit Deri. Levy is the first blind legal intern at the State Attorney’s Office, which equipped him with special software and provided two National Service assistants to help him. Daphna Vaknish, the head of interns at the Tel Aviv District Attorney's Office, emphasized that Levy was accepted based on merit. 'He is treated like any other intern, required to meet the same targets, and he does so successfully.' 'Judges are amazed when Matan argues on behalf of the state and demonstrates his full command of the material,' Attorney Deri praised Levy's work. 'For example, we appeared in 23 different hearings before the parole board, and Matan handled it all flawlessly from memory, overcoming the challenges of working without written documents. He inspires everyone at the office.' Levy's work requires deep familiarity with complex legal documents, which he manages by listening to them rather than reading. 'While others can read through the material multiple times, I rely on my memory. My assistants, Yair and Ben, read the material to me once or twice, and I memorize it. I write legal opinions, argue in court, and appear before parole boards, handling everything like any other prosecutor,' he says. 'Most of my cases are in district courts. I feel like I’m living my dream. I can’t fight on the battlefield in Gaza or the north, but I’m fighting serious crime for the country in the courtroom. No terrorist can diminish my motivation or take away my smile.' October 14 marked the anniversary of Levy's injury. 'For me, it’s not the day I was wounded—it’s the day I survived. As long as I’m alive, I live with my head held high. I’ve decided to live a full and meaningful life despite my blindness. During my recovery, I met my partner, who is now both my eyes and my heart. Life is a blessing, and every moment is a gift.'

Hezbollah leadership filled with unknown figures, report says	Hezbollah has replenished its ranks of commanders and key leadership positions with operatives whose names Israel 'didn’t even know,' an Israeli official told The New York Times on Saturday. In an extensive article on Hezbollah's ongoing fight against Israel despite heavy losses, the official explained that these new leaders were previously low-ranking members in the chain of command.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkz110swgke	2024-10-19T08:20:24-07:00

Fallen warrior? Gaza’s heroic portrayal of Sinwar's death	Though IDF reports Hamas leader hid, fled and killed by Israeli forces, Gazans portray him as a hero; in resurfaced video, Sinwar declares, 'I prefer to die as a martyr than die ‘just because' While Israel celebrated the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, with international headlines labeling him a 'rat in a hole,' many in Gaza are hailing him as a hero. Footage of his final moments, where he appears masked, wounded and covered in soot has reinforced the narrative in Gaza that he 'fought until the very end.' Hours after the official announcement of his death, a video of Sinwar circulated in Gaza. In the footage, filmed during a 2021 interview, Sinwar said, 'The greatest gift the occupation can give me is to murder me.' He added, 'I would rather die as a martyr than from COVID, a stroke or a car accident. At this age (then 59), I am closer to that promise. I prefer to die a martyr rather than die ‘just because.’' Footage revealed by IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari showed Sinwar in his final moments, sitting alone in a corner of a room, covered in soot. The drone footage that captured him showed Sinwar holding a stick, which he weakly attempted to throw at the drone in an unsuccessful effort to bring it down. He did not return fire and likely realized his death was imminent. Unlike the meticulously planned assassinations of figures like Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif or Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah over the war, Sinwar's death occurred by chance, following a prolonged search in the area. 'Sinwar was hiding in an area our forces had surrounded for a long time. We didn’t know he was there, but we continued to act decisively. Our forces found Sinwar with a vest, a pistol and 40,000 shekels in cash. He tried to flee, and our forces eliminated him,' the IDF said. Despite his death, Gazan media quickly spread AI-generated images and cartoons portraying Sinwar in a heroic light. One image shows him leaning on the same stick he had thrown at the drone, accompanied by the caption, 'Defending the entire world to eradicate Zionist terrorism.' Another image, showing him standing with a vest and firing a weapon that was not in his possession at the time, depicts the gunshot wound on his head as only a small cut. Another cartoon depicted the chair Sinwar sat on in a famous image taken after the 2014 Operation Guardian of the Walls. While Sinwar himself is absent from the cartoon, the gun he held in the original photo remains on the chair, symbolically waiting for his successor, reinforcing the notion that 'leaders change, but the idea remains.' Conversely, another cartoon highlighted Iran's loss following Sinwar’s death, depicting him as a puppet whose strings had been cut, signaling that Iran may no longer control Gaza as before. Additionally, a photo of Sinwar from his release during the 2011 Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange was recirculated. Gazan photographer Khaled al-Safi, who captured the image at the Rafah crossing, wrote, 'That was his reunion with freedom, and today was his reunion with martyrdom. You were blessed with life and became a sacred martyr.' Meanwhile, Hamas senior official Mahmoud Mardawi, perhaps in an effort to maintain the narrative of Sinwar as a 'heroic leader,' said that selecting a successor 'will not take long, it’s a natural process.' He also emphasized that 'our conditions for cease-fire negotiations will not change after Sinwar’s death,' further suggesting that 'the idea remains.'

Turkey says Israel pushing Iran to take 'Legitimate Steps'	Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan speeking in Istanbul during a visit of his Iranian counterpart says Israel is opening new fronts and drawing Iran into the war Israel's attacks in Lebanon and Gaza are pushing Iran to take 'legitimate steps', Turkey's foreign minister said Saturday in a joint press conference in Istanbul with his Iranian counterpart. 'Israel's aggressive stance is forcing Iran to take legitimate steps,' Turkey's Hakan Fidan said alongside Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was 'constantly opening new fronts in the region' and 'trying to draw Iran into this war,' he said. 'The risk of war spreading to the entire region should not be underestimated.' Iran backs the Hamas terror group in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, whose top leaders have been killed by Israel in the widening Middle East crisis. Iran also backs Houthi rebels in Yemen and Shiite militias in Iraq, as well as Syria's armed forces. Tehran collectively calls these proxies and militias an 'axis of resistance' against Israel. On October 1, Iran launched a barrage of around 200 missiles in retaliation for the September 27 killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and the July 31 killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel, which has vowed to strike back at Iran for that barrage, on Wednesday in Gaza killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, mastermind of the October 7 massacre that triggered the current war and escalating regional crisis. Iran's Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) have warned they would hit Israel 'painfully' if it attacks Iranian targets. Iran hosted naval drills on Saturday, with the participation of Russia and Oman and observed by nine other countries began in the Indian Ocean on Saturday, Iran's state TV said. The exercises, dubbed 'IMEX 2024', are aimed at boosting 'collective security in the region, expand multilateral cooperation, and display the goodwill and capabilities to safeguard peace, friendship and maritime security', the English-language Press TV said. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, said anyone with information on Israel's pending strike on Iran is accountable. 'Anybody with knowledge or understanding of 'how and when Israel was going to attack Iran', and/or providing the means and backing for such folly, should logically be held accountable for any possible causality,' he said in a post on X referring to the U.S. after President Joe Biden said he has an understanding of how and when Israel was going to retaliate against missile attacks by Iran. He declined to elaborate.

Some Lebanese Americans endorse Harris, expect more Lebanon suppo...	In a letter, the signatories write they were reassured that their concerns about the violence in Lebanon and the need for economic and political reforms would be supported if Harris won the elections; Trump avoids any specifics about plans for the Middle East Some prominent Lebanese Americans on Friday endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris for president, saying in a letter that the U.S. had been 'unrelenting' in its support for Lebanon under the Biden administration and they expect additional backing if Harris wins in November. Signatories include former members of Congress Donna Shalala and Toby Moffett, former President Barack Obama's onetime transportation secretary Ray LaHood, academics, CEOs and investors. The endorsement came amid ongoing Israeli attacks on Lebanon. According to the Lebanese health ministry, more than 1.2 million people have been displaced. The Hezbollah terror group has also fired on Israel killing soldiers and civilians. On Saturday, over 150 rockets targeted Israel, killing at least one man and wounding others. A number of Arab Americans and Muslims are abandoning the Democratic Party over the Biden administration's support for Israel in its war with Hamas. Some Arab Americans and Muslims have declined to endorse Harris, while others are backing her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, or third-party candidate Jill Stein of the Green Party. The letter was organized by Ed Gabriel, president of the American Task Force on Lebanon, a Washington policy group, in his personal capacity. Gabriel is one of several Arab American and Muslim leaders who met with Harris when she visited Flint, Michigan, on Oct. 4. The signers wrote they had been reassured that their concerns about the violence in Lebanon and the need for economic and political reforms would be supported if Harris won the Nov. 5 election. Her views stood in 'stark' contrast to Trump, they wrote, without elaboration. 'This year has been very difficult, given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza and given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon.' Harris said on a visit to Michigan, home to the largest Arab American community in the United States. She said the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar 'can and must be a turning point.' 'Everyone must seize this opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza, bring the hostages home and end the suffering once and for all,' she said. Trump's campaign had no immediate comment, but a source close to the campaign said it planned more outreach events in Michigan next week. Trump also stopped by a campaign headquarters in Hamtramck, a suburb of Detroit, on Friday. Trump, meanwhile, avoided any specifics about his plans for the Middle East, but he said he didn’t think the Arab American community would vote for Harris 'because she doesn’t know what she’s doing.'

Netanyahu says he is undeterred after drone targets his home	The prime minister and his wife were not at home during the drone attack on their private residence, the PMO says; Netanyahu says nothing will deter him and the war is to continue until victory Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday posted a clip filmed in Jerusalem saying nothing will deter him, just hours after a drone attack targeted his private residence in Caesarea.

The drone landed on another resident but caused no injuries. No sirens were activated, causing residents of the affluent community to voice their anger. 'There was a buzzing sound before the drone hit,' one resident said. 'It was unclear where it came from but then the explosion occurred.' 'I live nearby,' another man said. 'the explosion was louder than we were used to. At first we thought this may be an Iranian attack and could not understand why no sirens were activated. Can we feel safe? Once again a drone manages to evade low flying choppers and intercepts and this time it hit a house here.' 'The day before yesterday, we eliminated arch-terrorist Yahya Sinwar. I said we were in our war of revival,' Netanyahu said. 'We are carrying on to the end. I am proud of our soldiers, our commanders and the citizens and nothing will deter me,' he said. Netanyahu's neighbors in Caesarea said they observed a convoy leaving the community in the early morning, before the drone strike but according to his office, he has not been in the home for over a week.

IDF soldier investigated for war crimes in Belgium	Probe launched after Palestinian journalists' investigative report into elite IDF unit, claiming civilians were executed; Belgian Justice minister says Israel has the right to self-defense but that does not excuse it from following international law Belgium prosecution was investigating a man with dual Israeli-Belgium citizenship who fought in Gaza, for war crimes. Israeli officials said an investigation was launched after Palestinian groups lodged a criminal complaint, but no proceedings have been put into place. According to Belgium's prosecution, the investigation centers around a 22-year-old citizen of the country who served as a sharpshooter in an elite unit of the IDF. It followed an investigative report by Palestinian journalist Younis Tirawi who accused the unit of 'the brutal execution of unarmed civilians.' Tirawi said he received his information from an American who also serves in the unit and who provided evidence that civilians were being targeted although they posed no danger. The unit which was operating in Gaza since October, is made up of 21 soldiers, among them three American nationals, two Frenchmen, a German, an Italian and a citizen of Belgium who is now being investigated. Belgium's Justice Minister Paul Van Tigchelt said on Friday that the investigation hoped to uncover whether the report was true. 'Israel has a right for self-defense but that does not excuse its duty to respect international humanitarian law,' he said.

A drone launched in Lebanon hits a building in the affluent community where prime minister's private residence is located; rockets fall into the Sea of Galilee Haifa, its surrounding areas and central Israel came under attack on Saturday after an explosion was heard in the affluent community of Caesarea, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence is located when an attack drone crashed into a building.

Earlier still, sirens in the Emek Hefer region nearby warned of a hostile aircraft which the military then said was the result of a false alarm. In Tel Aviv and areas to the north of the city, sirens were also heard, warning of a drone strike although no explosions were heard there. 'During the past hour, three UAVs were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory,' the IDF said in a statement. 'One additional UAV hit a structure in the area of Caesarea. No injuries were reported. During the incident, sirens were activated in the Glilot military base. The presence of additional hostile aircraft in the area has been ruled out.' The military also said a projectile crossed the border from Lebanon and fell in an open area in the Haifa Bay region. There too, no injuries were reported.

Supporters of pro-Iran armed groups in Iraq stormed and ransacked the offices of a Saudi television channel in Baghdad early Saturday, a security source said, after the broadcaster aired a report referring to Iran-backed commanders as 'terrorists'. Between 400 and 500 people attacked the Baghdad studios of Saudi broadcaster MBC. 'They wrecked the electronic equipment, the computers, and set fire to a part of the building,' the interior ministry source told AFP on condition of anonymity, adding the fire had been extinguished and the crowd dispersed by police.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjfrriel1x	2024-10-18T20:22:44-07:00

The Portuguese Parliament approved Friday a resolution designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organization and instructed the government to present the issue to the European Union, as Portugal lacks its own terrorism list. The proposal was introduced by the right-wing Liberal Initiative party, but it received widespread support, with the exception of the communists who opposed it and the far-left Bloc of the Left party, which abstained. Among the supporters of the resolution were also left-wing parties that have expressed opposition to Israel.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkwhqbxg1e	2024-10-18T13:52:44-07:00

IDF chief says 1,500 Hezbollah operatives eliminated, others surr...	Herzi Halevi says even Iran may not fully grasp what’s happening to Hezbollah, and the IDF continues to deliver significant blows and wipe out local leadership; Hezbollah fires over 75 projectiles from Lebanon into Israel and 6 UAVs intercepted by the IAF IDF Chief of Staff, Herzi Halevi said Friday that some 1,500 Hezbollah operatives were killed in the ongoing ground operation in Lebanon. Halevi held a situational assessment with top Northern Command commanders, and added, 'We are determined to strike Hezbollah as hard as possible.' We’ve taken out their entire senior command and are wiping out their local leadership.' 'Their entire chain of command is collapsing. Hezbollah is hiding casualties, including dead commanders. Our conservative estimate is that 1,500 operatives have been killed, likely more, given the scale of the strikes.' 'These are significant achievements,' he continued, 'Their willingness to surrender speaks volumes about their morale and self-confidence, as well as the combat capabilities you've demonstrated.' 'Even Iran may not fully grasp what’s happening to Hezbollah, its main proxy. Every day we’re delivering tough surprises, and you’ll continue bringing them—achieving victories while preventing the enemy from doing the same.' Meanwhile, on Friday over 75 projectiles fired by Hezbollah crossed from Lebanon into Israel. The IDF Spokesperson's Unit reported that the Israeli Air Force intercepted six UAVs throughout the day. The IAF has also struck dozens of launchers, Hezbollah infrastructure, command centers, and operatives in the area. IDF troops are conducting targeted raids in southern Lebanon, eliminating roughly 60 terrorists in air and ground operations. The troops dismantled rockets, anti-tank missile launchers, and large stockpiles of weapons, including explosives, mortars, and RPGs.

Israel’s elite rescue unit 669: 'We have no fear, ready to return...	The daring rescues under heavy fire, soldiers arriving at the helicopter with no pulse and surviving, and the nightmare moment when they lost friends in Gaza chopper crash; 6 elite Unit 669 soldiers, who juggle between reserve duty and working as doctors at Soroka Medical Center, explain why, even with some now grandparents, leaving the unit is unimaginable On the first night of the Gaza ground operation, the wounded young armored corps soldier that Sgt. Maj. (Res) Dr. Y. was treating, died in his arms. 'We were at a base in southern Israel,' says Y.' At 2am, we were called to treat armored corps guys who’d been hit by an anti-tank missile. His mother is the first thing I think about in such situations. Someone’s son is now lying wounded somewhere in Gaza, waiting for us to come get him out of there. If his mother knew what was happening, what wouldn’t she do to save him?' The helicopter landed in southern Gaza. 'We landed in the dark. The doors opened, and I saw the guys treating him running toward us. I couldn’t make out their faces. They were all covered in dust, but you know that whoever’s running toward you now is your best friend. Under different circumstances, you’d hug one another and drink coffee together. Now, they were shouting out the treatment they’ve given him. We took off back to Israel. We had three, men from this incident: One severely wounded, one in critical condition, and the other was relatively okay.' Dr. Y. says that choosing who to treat is simply a game of roulette. There’s nothing you can change. You’ve been given a wounded soldier. Now he’s yours. This was the situation on that flight. 'I could hardly see a thing' he says. 'It was dark and we were flying with no lights. I put my hands on his chest and face and couldn’t feel anything. I hooked him up to the machines and realized that he was in a very bad way.' 'I did everything I could to save him. I administered artificial respiration and gave him a blood transfusion. I only saw the severity of his injury as we turned on the helicopter lights on entering Israeli territory. I didn’t for a moment think he was dead. I also didn’t stop. We treated him until landing at Soroka. I’ve never been so happy to see the hospital lights.' The helicopter landed, and Y. rushed to the medical team with his wounded man. 'I ran with him into the trauma center, panting and shouting ‘low blood pressure, no vital signs’. My friends at the hospital weren’t moving. No one approached us. No one was helping me. With a sad look on their faces, they just took the ventilator from me.' 'I kept telling them what his condition was. And 30 people were just looking at me, realizing he’d already died. I hadn’t gotten it yet. Then it hit me. I asked ‘What? That’s it?’ And they nodded. The deputy hospital director patted me on the shoulder and the anesthesiologist gave me a kiss. I started crying. It was such a blow. I believed in what I was doing, in the treatment I was administering on the way. And he’s not with us anymore.' In his journal, Y. describes the terrible moment he parted from the young soldier he tried to save. 'I’m no longer his medical caregiver. I’m a citizen for whom he died. I lean in toward him, looking at his beautiful face, one hand tightly clasping his hand, the other on his shoulder. I begged his forgiveness. The mother was echoing in my head. God help us. If only she knew, she’d tear out her heart and switch it with his.' This is how the IDF’s most combat doctors sound. They’ve been in action for a year, saving lives on the battle field and in the safe and familiar hospital setting. They respond to any call to any injury or military altercation, land in the warzone, invariably under heavy fire, and evacuate the wounded to Israel. Just so that soldiers may come back to life, recover, and get back to themselves and to their families. Unit 669, or as it’s officially known, the 'Tactical Unit for Special Rescue' is a special IDF elite unit. Its role is to evacuate the dead and wounded from war and disaster zones. Unit combatants whose names cannot be published show up at evacuation zones in helicopters and on foot to evacuate those demanding medical treatment. Since the war began, the unit has conducted 800 rescue flights within the Gaza Strip, evacuating over 1,800 wounded to trauma centers across the country, providing them with urgent, lifesaving medical care on the way. In the current war, some are also operating on foot alongside infantry forces inside Gaza. For this article, we interviewed six Soroka doctors serving in 669: Maj. (Res) Dr. S (58); Sgt. Maj. (Res) Dr. Y. (35). Lt. Col. (Res) Dr, A (58); Maj. (Res) Prof. Y. (48), Maj. (Res) Prof. A. (52) and Maj. (Res) Dr. L. (50). They’re all married with children. Some have grandchildren. This is an extraordinary, elite team of people who, for the past year, have been dividing their time between routine work in the busy southern trauma center that treated the wounded on October 7, and has since treated hundreds of wounded soldiers, saving lives in Gaza, and risking their lives on every mission. They’re called to the danger epicenter at every hour, day or night, fight for the lives of the wounded, even if it seems hopeless. They hail from varied professional medical backgrounds. They’re surgeons, intensive care specialists, anesthesiologists and orthopedic doctors. Some are young, setting out on their medical careers. Others are senior doctors, including department heads in their 50s at top of their profession. Their age and hospital positions have long released them from reserve duty, but they adamantly refuse surrendering the right to save lives. 'We get to the field, with all our hearts in it, knowing we have to reach them as quickly as possible and bring them in for medical care' says. Prof. Y. 'The number of wounded can sometimes hinder you. Lots of evacuations are conducted under fire. There’s a lot of shelling and artillery fire, but you show up with a clear goal: finding the wounded as quickly as possible, and bringing them back alive into Israeli territory, to a hospital that will treat them. This makes the difference between life and death. Emotions come later.' 'Two weeks ago, they turned from doctors to patients. Operations of this small secret unit, the identity of whose members cannot be published, that’s usually conducted in the shadows, were recently exposed to the public. Due to poor terrain conditions, a Yasur helicopter on a routine mission evacuating a soldier shot in southern Gaza, crashed a few seconds before landing. Two combat soldiers Sgt. Maj. (Res) Daniel Alush and Sgt. Maj. (Res) Tom Ish-Shalom were killed in the incident, and eight more were injured, some severely, including the male and female pilots flying the helicopter, and two airborne doctors. Conditions of all injured have since greatly improved and they’re now out of danger. 'I got a call from the unit in the middle of night, telling me there was an extraordinary incident' says Lt. Col. Dr. A. 'Before leaving the hospital, I asked myself what should I be wearing now – Soroka scrubs or my army uniform? I went for the uniform, thinking that my friends, lying in beds as 'wounded,' would feel safer in the company of brothers in arms. The incident’s severity soon became clear. 'This wasn’t my first time in war finding myself treating people I know' says A. But the large number of wounded meant I needed to deal with it differently. I was not only helping treat them. I also had to brief the unit, whose people were extremely concerned.' 'My work demands I separate my mind from my heart. The work becomes technical. It was impossible in this case. These are people I’ve known for years: The pilots and the helicopter mechanic with whom I’ve flown so many times. They’re all very close friends. You could call them family. In recent months, I’ve spent more time with them than at home. We’ve been together in extremely dangerous situations. Together we’ve saved lots of soldiers’ lives.' How do you deal with such situation, the difficulty of treating the people closest to you? 'Our accrued experience demands we behave in a certain way. Otherwise, the treatment result won’t be as good. It sinks in later. We felt we had to represent our friends to their families and make them feel they’re in the safest possible place that we’d provide them with the best treatment possible. It’s very important for me to support people who aren’t from the medical profession – pilots, mechanics and their families, giving them the feeling that everyone’s with them, in the same boat.' All this as everyone in the unit know that, under different circumstances, on a different day, it could have been them there, lying in the trauma center bed 'We subconsciously know that this is an incident that could occur. The team involved in the incident had replaced me on my standby shift. Our tasks are completely identical. The chances of my lying there on the bed are exactly the same as theirs. If circumstances were different, they could be treating me.' Maj. Prof. A, also a senior hospital and unit doctor, chose to deal with the incident differently. 'I’ve developed the ability to block out things that interfere with my functioning' he says. 'The injured need me as a doctor, and I function as such. A few hours after the incident, the doctors in the WhatsApp group were talking about the incident, writing about how sad it was. I wrote, ‘Guys, we need to be strong. Our next wounded are waiting for us’.' 'Through the years, we take risks. As soon as a helicopter takes off, there are risks from both above and below. It’s no secret. I’m sure if before taking off in the helicopter, you were to tell those who fell in the course of duty, that it may crash that day, they’d stay on that helicopter.' And what about you? You’re part of the unit not just in medical terms, but also in the fighting. You’re exposed to its dangers. Does this kind of incident scare you? Dr. A. 'I’m going back to reserve duty today. The soldiers need me. I have to give them everything I can. I spoke to the pilot. We told him that we completely trust him and what they’re doing, and that we’re not afraid. We’re going out into the field again tomorrow.' Protocol for treating the wounded on the battlefield has changed during this war. Rather than trying to save them with daring and dangerous operations demanding time and space, the wounded are stabilized and evacuated to the hospital as quickly as possible. In more urgent or severe, imminently life-threatening cases, they’re taken to Soroka, a ten-minute flight from the Gaza Strip. Maj. Prof. A says: 'We do our best not to do anything we don’t have to. We stabilize the patient while we’re on the move and only do what we must to save him - giving him blood transfusions, opening veins. We less administer respiration and tracheal intubation (inserting a tube into the trachea windpipe). The helicopter is a substitute for the hospital. We’re guided by getting to the hospital as quickly as possible to provide the patient with the best care.' 'The most critical decisions are those taken in the first minute of treatment. Whatever’s decided in those moments can often determine whether the patient lives or dies. It’s an enormous responsibility. I think we do this extraordinarily well. You have seven or eight minutes before reaching the hospital to prepare everything you need. You can’t delay getting him into the trauma center even for a second after the helicopter has landed.' 'There are days we fly almost non-stop' says Prof. Y. 'We land in the field near the wounded man and get him to the hospital as fast as we can. The injuries from this war aren’t just from guns. There are lots of shrapnel and explosive devices too. The team also knows that, even after one of our patients dies, we have to carry on working. More wounded men are waiting for us in the field. We draw our strength from our success stories.' And, thankfully, there’s no shortage of these stories. 'In the war’s first week, we were called to rescue wounded men' says Prof. A. 'One of them, we were told, was in a stable condition. His condition, however, quickly deteriorated on the helicopter. We started giving him blood transfusions and administered artificial respiration. He had head injuries and had been hit on the arms and legs. We brought him to Soroka where we opened his chest to massage his heart muscles. He underwent a series of operations, and gradually regained consciousness. When I came back from the army, I carried on treating him. He spent a month with us and then onto rehabilitation. When I tell my team about this case, it really makes their day.' Maj. Dr. L. has recently joined the unit after serving as a combat pilot. In recent months, he’s been serving alongside the ground forces. 'I’m totally an infantry soldier' he says. 'All the unit’s doctors come from the core medical professions. They’re all experienced in treating the wounded in war conditions. Having experienced doctors with them, gives the forces on the ground a great sense of safety.' 'Treating the wounded in the field is very different from how we treat them in the helicopters' says L. 'I feel an enormous sense of duty and mission. You reach the wounded on the battlefield minutes, sometimes less, after the injury, armed up like the unit’s combat soldiers. You’re invariably getting shot at and you shoot back if you have to. My purpose as a doctor isn’t killing terrorists, but rather getting to the wounded at any cost, even when they’re firing at my head.' Haven’t you asked yourself what the hell you’re doing there, running around the alleyways of Gaza with a gun? Is this what you studied medicine for? 'My eldest son is 22. Spending time with the ground forces, with the guys from infantry and the armored corps, who are mostly his age, generates collaboration and brotherhood. Being able to sit together in Gaza and do whatever necessary together, not just fighting or treating the wounded, creates an amazing sense of unity.' Is closure, knowing what happens to the wounded you’ve treated, important for you? Prof. Y. 'Getting feedback about what happens is very important. The unit’s team know I’m from Soroka. Lots of them say to me, ‘We brought you a wounded soldier. What’s with him?’ They need to know that everything that’s done is done for the best. Even when a wounded soldier dies, it’s important for us to know. It’s closure of sorts.' 'During evacuation, we’re all determined to carry out the mission at its very best' says Dr. Y. 'Afterwards, on the landing pad, some cry, others hug. What we do is very rewarding. We’ve brought in soldiers in critical condition, at death’s door, and they survived. We had a soldier from central Gaza in a severe state of shock due to blood loss. When we brought him to the helicopter, he was as white as snow, with blood Oxygen saturation level of 38, the normal level being close to 100. The doctor with me thought that was the end of him. We suddenly saw him slightly gesturing. We said ‘Yallah, let’s go.’ We inserted blood through a hole in the bone and saved his life. His mother’s still in touch with us.' He says that they do remember the joyful success stories, but that they mainly remember the soldiers they don’t manage to save. 'I remember their faces. I have a list of all the soldiers I’ve evacuated. Who survived, and who was killed. It’s not easy. After every mission, everyone looks for their own wounded man, so see what happened with him. It doesn’t always end well. Some die, others have brain damage. We’re still in touch with some of them. We’re invited to their weddings. Changing from my army to uniform to my Soroka scrubs, and meeting people I’ve saved from the hell of Khan Younis, and I see them doing well, is a dream come true.' The medical team in the field and helicopters fight for the lives of every wounded man, how severe their condition. 'It’s important to convey this message to everyone, including the soldiers, families, brother, sisters, wives and girlfriends' says Dr. S. 'We have the most professional people in the army and medical profession in this unit. We treat the wounded in the most professional way. If we show up, they can relax. We’ll do whatever needed to save their loved ones.' 'We don’t give up' says Prof. A. 'Despite the standard approach in trauma being not resuscitating anyone with no signs of life following severe trauma, we’ll often keep trying fighting for these guys, both in the helicopters and at the hospital. How can we give up on them? They went to protect us, and we just give up? In the trauma center, they open the chest and massage to heart muscle to save them. The battle for their lives is to the bitter end.' This desperate and heroic medical care invariably demands unconventional means. 'We’ve developed lots of systems that don’t appear in the literature. Medical treatment in the field is very quick, and the wounded that used to die during evacuation, are now reaching the hospital alive. I open a vein with a very broad catheter that allows me to give him blood transfusion within one minute. You get a body, and a few minutes later, after four or five doses, he comes back to life. I’ve no idea how many of these we’ve seen. Patients we were told we couldn’t save have come back to life and recovered. We fight for them until the very last moment.' To save these wounded, Prof. A. tells us, you need to make decisions very quickly. 'What helps in these situations is experience, which we have, along with the medical profession we routinely practice. We can get a wounded man who’s relatively okay, and then he can suddenly decline. You need to make a thousand decisions to save him.' What’s going on with the injured guys when all this is happening? Can you talk to them, to calm them down, under all this pressure? Can you explain what’s about to happen? 'Generally, what they care about at that moment is what’s going on with their friends. Amidst the helicopter noise, with our helmets on, we shout, ‘Everything’s okay, you’ll live. We’ll be at the hospital in five minutes’. It’s very important to calm them, and we do that. At the hospital, the first thing we ask anyone who’s conscious, is their parent’s or wife’s telephone number. We give him a minute before respiration to exchange a few words with his family and explain what’s happened.' 'These soldiers, who survive injuries, will often develop post-trauma. I’m sure those minutes you spend calming them down, telling them ‘Everything’s okay. We’re going to save you and you’ll go back to living as you were before you were injured’ are critical in averting post trauma. What happens when, as a doctor, it’s already clear that what you’re promising isn’t going to happen? 'I lie. And there’s a very good chance he won’t even remember what went on there, under the influence of the painkiller and sometimes anesthetic medication. I believe this lie is for the best.' 'Evacuations aren’t always tragic' says Dr. Y. 'You also get magical, even comical moments. We had an American lone soldier who was psyched that we’d come to rescue him in a helicopter. He stared out of the window, stunned that he was in a Black Hawk. Midflight, he took an exercise book out of his pocket and started documenting the evacuation. Another soldier rolled up a cigarette in the helicopter.' There’s no shortage of success stories, some miraculous. 'We had a wounded man with no signs of life' says Prof. A. 'We could tell by the color of his skin, that he was dead, or in a very deep state of shock. We began resuscitating him and his breathing was agonal, i.e., terminal. We administered artificial respiration while infusing blood through two veins. A few minutes later, and he wasn’t breathing at all. We intubated him and he suddenly opened his eyes and started breathing. By the time we got to the hospital, his condition was relatively okay, breathing just with the aid of a mask. I’ve seen lots of amazing things in my work as a doctor. I’d never seen anything like that. I’ve had other very strange cases that, with all my professional experience, I’d say just couldn’t have happened.' Lt. Col. A. tells us, 'We do everything for every injured man, until nothing more can be done, to the point you declare him dead. We don’t give up even on a guy who’s dead when he’s brought into helicopter or lying on the ground. These soldiers are my son’s age. I can’t see myself giving up on a kid like this. I might be asked why we do all of this. After all, there’s no chance of saving him. But we’ve seen wounded men, who we thought there was no chance of saving, who recovered.' And when it doesn’t work? 'It hurts like hell. Real pain inside. It’s very hard to see media reports with pictures of guys I’ve tried to save who didn’t survive. Our mission is that they should live. Even when you know it’s not your fault, and you know you didn’t fail, it’s a terribly disappointing feeling.' On the morning of October 7, when it still wasn’t clear who was fighting whom and what exactly was going on in the south, the unit’s fighters were called to help evacuate wounded people from the Gaza Periphery. Some were taken straight to the hospital where they’d reported for duty as soon as the sirens went off. It was only when they were in the air that they understood the magnitude of the horror. Maj. Dr. L. started his reserve duty in the unit two days earlier. When they took off at 6:30, he was on a shift at the base. 'We were in the air half an hour later, and by 8 o’clock, we were evacuating the wounded from the Gaza Periphery. We were on the first Sikorsky (helicopter) in the field. What did you see from above? 'The skies were clear and calm where we were, but what was on the ground, looked very different. As a combat pilot, I’ve lived much of life with headphones, but I’ve never heard noise like on that terrible day.' L. tells us that 30 hours of non-stop evacuation started there. 'We’d evacuate the wounded, land, get new medical equipment, and take off again, over and over and over again. We didn’t have time to go to the bathroom or eat properly. We obviously didn’t sleep either.' 'You can’t imagine such a thing and you’ve no way of mentally preparing for it. As a pilot, you like having a back-up plan for every unforeseen eventuality. This was outside all of that.' How did you know where to fly to? 'It took us time to understand what was going on. On a Sikorsky, you don’t have TV, and we weren’t getting reliable information from outside and the communication systems were very busy. We constructed a picture on our own, throughout the day. We reached the first wounded using Google Maps, via friends and forces on the ground sending us locations. In the first evacuation, we were told, ‘Take the injured guy and take off. There are lots of terrorists around.’ We had severely wounded cases that we rushed to evacuate. Again and again. We gradually understood that this incident was like nothing else.' 'In the afternoon, we were sent to a Golani outpost with dozens severely wounded soldiers. The helicopter took off as soon as we got out as it was being shot at. We planned leaving with the wounded, but the gunfire exchange meant the helicopter couldn’t return. We reached late afternoon, and it didn’t look like we were getting out of there. At some stage, we got an Apache that fired at the terrorists from the sky as we loaded lots and lots of people onto the little helicopter and flew away. After dropping them off at Soroka, we got back into the field to carry on evacuating the wounded. In the huge chaos of that day, Soroka’s trauma center was like coming home after a hard day. You know you’ve brought the wounded to the right place.' Unlike hospital corridors where the department head is God, and the senior doctors his deputy, here at 669, everyone’s equal. The collaborative work, under fire, with the one and only purpose of saving our soldiers, turns the unit’s doctors and soldiers into a single body. Thus Dr. Y., the most junior of the team who started his residency less than a year ago, a mere week before the war broke out, found himself working shoulder to shoulder with his department head, with no hierarchical pretenses. 'All the senior doctors at Soroka are my friends from the unit. People at the hospital sometimes don’t know how to take it. We’re always hugging in the corridors and slapping one another on the back.' 'The professor is a special kind of guy. On the outside, he seems rather stern, but inside he’s as sweet as can be. At 2am October 7, I met him at a base in central Israel with a sandwich in his hand, and he asked me if I wanted a bite. He’d just evacuated dozens of severely injured people, and needed a hug himself. One day, I went to sleep and woke up to find cookies placed next to my bed and note reading, ‘Take care of yourself’.' And the love seems to be mutual. 'He’s an amazing guy. I’ve known since joining the unit' the department head says of his young resident. 'I’m proud he’s doing his residency with me. Being his supervisor is an honor.' This past year’s intensive work has created a special, almost family, bond between the two. 'At the end of the day, the unit has made us who we are' says Sgt. Maj. Y. 'I’ve become a totally different person since joining 669. Each person here is better than the next. ‘Salt of the Earth’ doesn’t cover it. We have people with an amazing desire to give. No one asks questions. No one thinks twice. We’re all addicted to the task and to the work. The chances of being part of this group are super low. The unit is super small and intimate. We all feel lucky to be part of it.' They all say that, after the mission itself, deep friendship is perhaps the most important part of their service. So, despite dealing with ongoing danger, no one was prepared for administering urgent medical care to their professional and unit colleagues. Dr. S., the oldest of the group, grandfather to a little granddaughter born during the war, was also injured evacuating wounded from Gaza. 'It was the second sortie that day' he says. 'The second incident was very hard and complex, with people killed and severely wounded. After initial assessment, I took the most severely wounded soldier who’d been hit by an explosion and was unconscious. At the Soroka landing pad, when we took him out and ran, taking him to the trauma department, I suddenly slipped and fell on the grass. I got up and fell again. I felt I couldn’t control my leg, so I told the guys, 'Run, I’ll be okay.' I was taken to the trauma department, where, once again, I got up and fell down. Only then did I understand that something had happened.' But this rather dry story doesn’t give the full picture. Dr. Y. who was there with him tells us, 'S. had torn his thigh muscle, which is excruciatingly painful. He was screaming in pain, louder than the noise the helicopter makes, but he adamantly refused that we treat him. He said, 'Guys, don’t touch me. Treat the soldiers.' Everyone admits that, despite their great and sacred task, the double lives they’ve been leading for the past year, of demanding work both at the hospital and in the unit, comes at a heavy cost. Most are still serving in the reserves, dividing their time between the hospital and the unit. 'Its geographical location means that most are evacuated to Soroka' says Dr. Y. 'It’s my second home. After long, hard hours in the field, I’ll go into the trauma department and all my friends welcome me with a smile and a hug. You get a love-boost and you have the strength to carry on. And yet, being away from the family is hard. The hardest thing was parting from my wife October 7 when she was in her final trimester. I left her alone in the house with non-stop sirens and rumors of terrorists infiltrating Beersheba. She’d started packing my bag when I called her from the hospital to tell her I was no my way to the unit.' L's firstborn daughter was born three months later, and he received short leave from the unit, after which he immediately returned to the unit. 'It was hard leaving the house before. After the birth, it was so much harder. I felt I was abandoning my wife and daughter. Amidst the death we were seeing all around, my daughter was the source of great joy. She’s saving the situation. I’m a very blessed father.' 'Those weeks of fighting were very intense for me and my family.' I’ve already done 250 days of reserve duty this year. My wife keeps asking when it’ll all be over. She didn’t imagine this is what I’d be doing at the age of 50. But this is me. I have one clear purpose to what I do - saving lives. That’s why I joined the unit. It’s enormously important. Every hour of every day, if they need me, I pack my things and go out to them. That’s where I belong.' Haven’t you thought of stopping? Telling yourself you’ve given enough, and that now others can give? 'I never say enough. Definitely not now. I have no dilemmas.' 'Leaving has never crossed my mind' says Prof. Y. 'We’re doctors, but we’re soldiers just like our friends with us in the helicopters. Despite our differences in age and background, we’re a group, like fingers on a hand. You can’t punch with one finger missing.' Dr. S., still rehabilitating from the injury, is counting days until he can save lives in the air again. 'I’m dying to get back to the unit' he says. 'Just don’t tell my wife.'

Biden sees opportunity to potentially end Israel-Iran fighting 'f...	Biden says US has an understanding of how and when Israel was going to retaliate against missile attacks by Iran U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday there was an opportunity to deal with Israel and Iran in a way that potentially ends their conflict in the Middle East for a while. Speaking to reporters at the end of a visit to Berlin, Biden also said he has an understanding of how and when Israel was going to retaliate against missile attacks by Iran. He declined to elaborate. Tensions have been high in the region with Israel planning a response to the Oct. 1 missile attack carried out by Tehran. 'There's an opportunity in my view and my colleagues agree that we can probably deal with Israel and Iran in a way that ends the conflict for a while. That ends the conflict, in other words, that stops the back and forth,' Biden said. Biden added that he believed there was a possibility of working towards a ceasefire in Lebanon but that such efforts would be harder in Gaza.

The IDF Spokesperson's Unit reported Friday that in the past 24 hours, some 60 terrorists were eliminated in southern Lebanon, and numerous targets were struck from the air and ground. Additionally, it was reported that earlier, the Israeli Air Force successfully intercepted two drones approaching from Lebanon outside Israeli territory. During the operation, forces located and destroyed rockets and munitions in areas from which launches into Israel occurred. They also identified and dismantled anti-tank missile launchers prepared for firing alongside rockets and other weaponry stored in a facility.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byukjgelke	2024-10-18T10:30:42-07:00

The butcher from Khan Younis - How Sinwar became an arch-terroris...	With a name like Sinwar—a combination of 'Sin' and 'War'—what could one expect? Yahya Sinwar, the man who orchestrated the October 7 massacre, embodied a life filled with violence, brutality, and conflict Yahya Sinwar’s dark legacy began with his family’s displacement from Ashkelon (then Al-Majdal Asqalan) during the 1948 war, driven by a desire to fulfill the Nakba's vision. Raised under Israeli control after the 1967 Six-Day War, Sinwar attended school and university, but his hatred only grew. He particularly resented Egypt for its peace treaty with Israel, which he saw as a betrayal. At university, Sinwar became a disciple of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Hamas’ co-founder, whose extremist ideology—advocating for jihad against Israel—shaped Sinwar’s worldview. However, he earned the nickname 'Butcher of Khan Younis' not for killing Israelis, but for brutally torturing and killing Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel. His enthusiasm for such acts cemented his grim reputation. In 1988, Sinwar was sentenced to four life terms in Israeli prison for orchestrating abductions and killings of Israeli soldiers and suspected collaborators. He spent 22 years in prison, continuing his reign of terror by torturing fellow inmates. While some described him as fearless and brutal—often killing with his bare hands—others saw him as a coward, manipulating others into violence while keeping himself safe. During his time in prison, Sinwar learned Hebrew, read Israeli newspapers, and studied the culture, preparing for psychological warfare. He even wrote a novel, 'Thorns and Carnations,' an autobiographical tale. His stay in Israeli prison came at a significant cost to Israel—$612,000 over 22 years, which included life-saving surgery for a brain tumor by Israeli doctors. Ironically, one of those doctors later pleaded with Sinwar after his nephew was kidnapped by Hamas, only to find out the next day that his nephew had been killed. Sinwar’s brother, Muhammad, was instrumental in the kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, which ultimately led to Sinwar’s release in the 2011 prisoner exchange. After his release, Sinwar swiftly rose through Hamas’ ranks, seizing power in Gaza by 2017 through eliminating rivals, often via public executions or throwing opponents off rooftops. One of Sinwar’s early moves as Hamas leader was to cosmetically amend the organization’s charter, replacing the word 'Jews' with 'Zionists' and 'jihad' with 'Free Palestine.' Yet, his ultimate goal—the destruction of Israel—remained unchanged. Sinwar kept his personal life largely hidden, but recent footage showed him walking through a tunnel with his wife and children. Rumors of his brutality in his personal life linger, though details remain unclear. He frequently acted independently of Hamas leadership, including launching the October 7 attack without waiting for Hezbollah or Iran to coordinate, choosing to rely on fear. His plans unraveled—Hezbollah didn’t attack, Israeli Arabs didn’t rise up, and Iran stayed out of the fight. On October 16, 2024, Sinwar was killed by the IDF, marking the end of his violent reign. His plan to destroy Israel failed, and even Palestinians are growing tired of the devastation his leadership has brought to Gaza. Now, the question is where to go from here. This moment—the fall of the 'Butcher'—offers a chance to restore hope and normalcy to the region. It’s time to focus on freeing the hostages. Offering high sums of money to Gazans who return hostages alive could create an incentive for change. With international support, there is an opportunity to help Gazans form a leadership committed to peace and rebuilding alongside Israel. Amid the chaos Sinwar left behind, there is a rare chance to restore stability and dignity. But we must remember, there are more Sinwars—particularly his brother, who may be eager to continue the violence. One of the promises Israel made after October 7 was to bring the innocent hostages home. These hostages do not receive the privileged treatment Sinwar received in Israeli jail. They are deprived of medical care, food, and held only for the crime of being Jewish. Noam Dan from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum shared the following after Sinwar’s death: 'The elimination of Yahya Sinwar is an important achievement. However, true victory in this war hinges on the return of the 101 abductees still held in Gaza. While Sinwar’s death is a blow to Hamas, it brings mixed emotions for the families whose loved ones remain trapped in Hamas tunnels. Prime Minister Netanyahu must now act with the same determination and ensure the swift release of the abductees. Sinwar is no longer an obstacle—the responsibility lies squarely with Netanyahu to decide if he will be the leader who abandoned them or the one who brought them home.'

Russia is ready to help seek compromises between arch-foes Israel and Iran, President Vladimir Putin said on Friday, saying these would be difficult but possible.

And for such ways to resolve the situation to be found that would satisfy both sides,' Putin told reporters.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjtw2exx1g	2024-10-18T08:17:39-07:00	
New details of Sinwar's assassination and the fighting that conti...	IDF says the military's actions cornered Yahya Sinwar, preventing him from escaping from the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood and setting the stage for his elimination For weeks, IDF troops from the Nahal Brigade and the 828th (Bislamach) Brigade have been fighting in Rafah, closely cooperating with the Shin Bet. The Bislach combat team operating in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood identified several suspects, and during the ensuing battle, they discovered they had killed the notorious Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. On Friday, IDF forces encountered two terrorists around the house where Sinwar was located, one possibly part of the group that accompanied Sinwar in his final hours. A preliminary IDF investigation revealed that on Wednesday morning, around 10 am, a soldier from the 450th Battalion spotted two suspicious figures moving between the ruins of the neighborhood. He reported the sighting, and Battalion Commander Lt. Col. Ran Canaan advanced with infantry and armored forces. He observed three suspicious individuals—two walking ahead, wrapped in blankets, and a third trailing behind, wearing a combat vest and armed, with a hood covering his head. Initially, there was concern that the two figures could be hostages, and the commander opened fire at the third individual, identified as a terrorist, hitting his hand. At this point, no one realized the terrorists was Sinwar. Contrary to earlier claims, Sinwar did not lose his hand. 'He’s no Trumpeldor,' IDF officials remarked. At that moment, the terrorists split up. Two entered a nearby house, while the third, later confirmed as Sinwar, fled to another. The two fired back at the IDF forces, critically wounding a soldier from the 450th Battalion, who was airlifted to the hospital and has since improved. The battalion commander called in reinforcements to check the house where Sinwar had fled. Bloodstains were found on the stairs, and the commander realized it was fresh blood. Sinwar threw two grenades from a window, one of which exploded but caused no injuries. The IDF forces shelled the building with tank fire, missiles, and machine guns, still unaware of Sinwar’s identity. After the first shelling, a drone was sent inside and captured footage of Sinwar, wounded, sitting on a couch and throwing a stick at the drone. By this point, it was 4 pm—six hours after the operation had begun. A second shell was fired, along with heavy machine-gun fire, which ultimately killed him. The unit continued its heavy bombardment until part of the building collapsed. Later that evening, another drone was sent into the building and spotted a body, though it couldn’t yet be identified. The decision was made to wait until daylight to enter. Around midnight, another terrorist was spotted in a lookout post and was killed. By Thursday morning, when another drone was flown inside, the forces noticed the body bore a resemblance to Sinwar. Photos were sent to the Southern Command headquarters, and a senior officer shared them with his counterpart at the Shin Bet’s operations division, asking, 'Do you recognize him?' Shin Bet operational teams arrived at the scene and began forensic tests to confirm Sinwar’s identity. When Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman arrived on-site and saw the body with his own eyes, he immediately realized it was Sinwar. According to the IDF, 'This operation followed several months of fighting during which the IDF, in cooperation with the Shin Bet and led by the 162nd Division, fought against the Rafah Brigade and the Tel al-Sultan Battalion, eliminating hundreds of terrorists. These actions cornered Sinwar, preventing his escape and setting the stage for his elimination.' Southern Command Chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman praised the soldiers, saying, 'Your persistence, patience, analysis of the terrain, vigilance, and pursuit of contact—engaging them and opening fire—made a significant impact. Your determination, systematic searches, and refusal to give up finding each of them one by one, led to this moment. When the opportunity came, you acted with operational alertness, engaged, took them down, and quickly closed the circle. This is how it should be. Here in Rafah, in Tel al-Sultan, we did it, and we’ll continue to do so everywhere. You have earned great respect for that.'

Outrageous': Lebanon and Iran see rare disagreement over UN reso...	Lebanese government is outraged after Iranian official says in interview Tehran was willing to negotiate the implementation of UN Resolution 1701 A rare confrontation between the Lebanese government and Iran took place on Friday after a senior Iranian official said Tehran was willing to negotiate the implementation of UN Resolution 1701 from 2006, which brought an end to the Second Lebanon War and stipulated Hezbollah terrorists would not be allowed to operate south of the Litani River. The unusual statement, viewed in Beirut as a violation of its sovereignty, was made by Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro. In the interview, Ghalibaf also said that France could serve as a mediator between Hezbollah and Israel. 'There’s no such thing as Israel, only a Zionist regime, which is an armed wing of the U.S. and not worth negotiating with,' he said, but added, 'We see a faint light at the end of the tunnel, a light that indicates Iran is willing to negotiate with France, a country that has traditionally defended Lebanon, regarding the specific conditions for implementing Resolution 1701.' Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati expressed his outrage over the remarks and ordered the Iranian embassy chargé d'affaires to be summoned following the statement (the ambassador himself was injured in September’s pager attack and was evacuated to Tehran). 'We’re surprised by the Iranian Parliament Speaker’s statements. This declaration is an outrageous interference in Lebanon's affairs and an attempt to establish unacceptable control,' Mikati said. 'We informed the Iranian Foreign Minister and the Parliament Speaker during their recent visits to Lebanon that the Lebanese situation must be understood, especially since Lebanon is facing unprecedented Israeli attacks, and we’re working with all of Lebanon's allies, including France, to pressure Israel to a cease-fire,' Mikati added. 'The issue of negotiating the implementation of UN Resolution 1701 is managed by the state of Lebanon, and everyone is required to support it in this direction rather than impose new mandates, which are unacceptable from every national and sovereign perspective,' he added. Mikati has been heading a caretaker government for a long time due to his country’s prolonged political crisis. Although his government is weak and impoverished, some hope to strengthen it as part of a future settlement that could potentially end the conflict in the north based on the implementation of the UN’s resolution. Iran attempted to clarify Ghalibaf's remarks following Mikati’s response. A source close to the Iranian Parliament Speaker told the Hezbollah-affiliated network Al-Mayadeen, 'Ghalibaf's position affirms that Iran will support whatever the Lebanese government and Hezbollah support regarding a cease-fire. Cooperation with Europe aims to assist in reaching a cease-fire agreement that both the Lebanese government and Hezbollah will endorse.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjk00ja1xjl	2024-10-18T05:38:50-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/18/S1JEuo1xke/S1JEuo1xke_0_0_1000_567_0_small.jpg

Harvard sees biggest downtrend in donations in a decade	Donations to the prestigious Ivy League institute nosedive 15% in the last year against the backdrop of pro-Palestinian protests and president's resignation Harvard University experienced its most significant drop in donations in a decade, with a decrease of about $151 million compared to last year — marking a nearly 15% downtrend. This marks the largest decline since 2015, reflecting a turbulent period for the Ivy League institution. The main reason for this decline is the campus protests following the war in Gaza, which led to prominent university donors halting their funds, and the resignation of former president Prof. Claudine Gay, who faced harsh criticism regarding her handling of antisemitism on campus. The university's annual financial report indicated that Harvard received $1.17 billion in donations for the year ending in June 2024, a significantly lower number than the $1.38 billion received year-on-year. The greatest impact was on its endowment fund, which saw a 34% cut in donations, totaling a $368.1 million loss. Harvard's new president, Prof. Alan Garber, expressed his disappointment with this year's fundraising results, noting concerns they could signal future challenges in fundraising efforts. He stressed that some previous commitments still continue to support the university, but the financial report highlights the decline in donation revenue and the complex economic situation that created significant uncertainty regarding continued funding. The pro-Palestinian protests on campus, sparked by the university's response to the Hamas attack on October 7, led several key donors including the Ofer family, hedge fund mogul Ken Griffin and investor Len Blavatnik to withhold their contributions to Harvard. Despite the drop in donations, the university remains the wealthiest in the world, with an endowment fund valued at $53.2 billion, which yielded a 9.6% return over the past year. The financial report said the fund contributes about 37% of the institution's annual revenue, generating $2.4 billion that supports funding for professors' salaries, scholarships and research. University expenses continued to rise, primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits, but Harvard managed to end the year with a budget surplus of around $45 million. Despite this, Prof. Garber and the university's administration stressed the need for cautious financial management in the future, given that expenses continue to outgrow revenue. Harvard is the second Ivy League university to report a drop in donations this year following a wave of protests across campuses. New York’s Columbia University York, which spearheaded pro-Palestinian demonstrations on U.S. campuses, recorded a nearly 30% drop in donations during its annual giving day.

Sinwar's body relocated to Israeli site after autopsy	The former Hamas leader's body reportedly delivered to secret site in the country after inspection of his body was completed following his elimination The body of former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was eliminated in Gaza on Thursday, was delivered to a secret facility in Israel following the completion of its autopsy, Ynet learned on Friday. At this stage, it's unclear what will be done with his body and whether it will be used as a bargaining chip in future negotiations, which may also include a hostage deal to return the 101 Israeli hostages still held in the Gaza Strip. The autopsy revealed Sinwar was shot in the head and his body showed indication of bullet wounds. His body weight was normal. The results of the toxicology report, which will determine whether he was under the influence of drugs or psychoactive substances, have yet to be received. Sinwar was eliminated two days ago following an accidental encounter, without prior intelligence, with IDF soldiers in Rafah’s Tel al-Sultan refugee camp — the same area where the tunnel in which six Israeli hostages were executed at the end of August. The IDF later released drone footage following Sinwar’s encounter with the soldiers. IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari confirmed Thursday night that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in Tel Sultan by IDF soldiers the day before. 'For months, the IDF and Shin Bet gathered intelligence to eliminate Sinwar, the mastermind behind the October 7 massacre. He was hiding in the area, and we didn’t know he was there. We identified Sinwar as a terrorist inside a building, found him with a vest, a pistol and 40,000 shekels. He was on the run, and we eliminated him. No hostages were with him.'

Hezbollah says it will escalate war with Israel after Hamas leade...	Iran-backed terror group says Sinwar's death will strengthen its operative to launch new, stronger offensive against Israel amid Gaza war Lebanon's Hezbollah terror group said on Friday it was moving to a new and escalating phase in its war against Israel while Iran said 'the spirit of resistance will be strengthened' after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Sinwar, a mastermind of the October 7, 2023, attack that triggered the Gaza war, was killed during an operation by IDF soldiers in the Palestinian enclave on Wednesday, a pivotal event in the year-long war. Western leaders said his death offered an opportunity for the conflict to end, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war would go on until the hostages seized by Hamas militants were returned. 'Today we have settled the score. Today evil has been dealt a blow but our task has still not been completed,' Netanyahu said in a recorded video statement after the death was confirmed on Thursday. 'To the dear hostage families, I say: This is an important moment in the war. We will continue full force until all your loved ones, our loved ones, are home.' Sinwar, who was named as Hamas' overall leader following the assassination of political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, was believed to have been hiding in the warren of tunnels Hamas has built under Gaza over the past two decades. He was killed during a gun battle in southern Gaza on Wednesday by IDF troops who were initially unaware that they had caught their country's number one enemy, Israeli officials said. The military released a drone video of what it said was Sinwar, sitting on an armchair and covered in dust inside a destroyed building. Hamas has not made any comment itself, but sources within the terror group have said the indications they have seen suggest Sinwar was indeed killed by Israeli troops. 'Chief obstacle' Despite Western hopes of a cease-fire, Sinwar's death could dial up hostilities in the Middle East where the prospect of an even wider conflict has grown. Israel launched a ground campaign in Lebanon this month and is now planning a response to an October 1 missile attack carried out by Iran, an ally of Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah. But the demise of the man who planned the attack last year in which fighters killed 1,200 people in Israel and captured more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies, could also help push forward stalled efforts to end the war in which Israel has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities. U.S. President Joe Biden, who spoke to Netanyahu by phone to congratulate him, said Sinwar's death provided a chance for the conflict in Gaza to finally end and for Israeli hostages to be brought home. The U.S. wants to kick-start talks on a proposal to achieve a ceasefire and secure the release of hostages, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, calling Sinwar the 'chief obstacle' to ending the war. 'That obstacle has obviously been removed. Can’t predict that that means whoever replaces (Sinwar) will agree to a ceasefire, but it does remove what has been in recent months the chief obstacle to getting one,' he said. In recent weeks, Sinwar had refused to negotiate at all, Miller said. Iran indicated no sign the killing would shift its support. 'The spirit of resistance will be strengthened' following the death of Sinwar, its mission to the United Nations said. Hezbollah was also defiant, announcing 'the transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with Israel'. The IDF said on Friday it had also killed Muhammad Hassin Ramal, Hezbollah’s commander of the Tayibe area in southern Lebanon. No comfort, no compromise Families of Israeli hostages said that while the killing of Sinwar was a significant achievement, it would not be complete while hostages are still in Gaza. Avi Marciano, the father of Noa Marciano, who was killed in captivity by Hamas, told Israeli broadcaster KAN that 'the monster, the one who took her from me, who had the blood of all our daughters on his hands, finally met the gates of hell.' 'A little justice, but no comfort,' he said. 'There will be comfort only when Naama, Liri, Agam, Daniela and Karina, our girls' friends, return home.' In Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip, a displaced Palestinian named Thabet Amour told Reuters the Palestinian fight would continue. 'This is resistance that does not disappear when men disappear,' he said. 'The assassination of Sinwar will not lead to the end of the resistance or to a compromise or surrender and raising the white flag.'

Court indicts Jerusalem man of planning to carry out attack in Te...	Jerusalem District Court charges Ibrahim Al-Ramadi with conspiracy to murder and incitement to terror after he planned to attack hostages' family protest The Jerusalem District Court on Friday indicted Ibrahim Al-Ramadi, a 22-year-old resident of East Jerusalem of planning to carry out a terror attack alongside Hamas terrorists in Tel Aviv during a hostages’ families’ protest in the city. According to the indictment, submitted by Attorney Pua Ben Tov from the Jerusalem District Prosecutor’s Office, the man intended to carry out a terrorist attack against Jews with two other individuals. To this end, he met with a Hamas member and a member of another West Bank terror group to enlist their help. The three planned to conduct an attack using a timed explosive and discussed the best way to carry out an attack that would harm as many Jews as possible. The indictment added that the three considered various options for the attack: placing an explosive at a demonstration advocating for the return of hostages in Tel Aviv, a shooting attack on a bus in the Jordan Valley, kidnapping Jews and placing an explosive on a Jewish bus. At some point, one of the group members decided to back out of the plan and the suspect brought in another person to finalize the details, having decided to carry out the attack in Tel Aviv during a demonstration for the return of the hostages. Detectives from the Israel Police’s Central Unit Jerusalem District Police arrested the man at his home on September 17 following Shin Bet directions. The charges added the suspect incited terrorism, expressed support for a terror organization and made several social media posts praising, sympathizing with and encouraging acts of terror. On October 9, 2023, two days after Hamas’ attack, he posted an image of Hamas terrorist with the caption, 'God, grant victory to Islam and Muslims.' The indictment charges the young man with terrorism charges including conspiracy to murder, expressing support for a terror organization, incitement to terrorism and contact with a foreign agent. The prosecution has requested that the defendant be remanded in custody until the end of the legal proceedings against him. 'The investigation revealed that at some point the man, a supporter of the Jenin Brigades and Hamas, decided to conspire with others from the West Bank to assist in his murderous plots. With their help, he planned to purchase weapons and explosives to carry out terrorist attacks against security forces and civilians,' the Israel Police and Shin Bet said in a joint statement. 'The joint investigation revealed that the terrorist had already written a will, created a social media group called 'Soldiers of God,' and was preparing to execute his plan to attack participants in the protest,' the statement added. 'Fortunately, however, he didn’t manage to acquire the weapons he had planned to use for the attack, as he was arrested by the Shin Bet and the police, thwarting his intentions. He declared that he still intended to carry out an attack even after his arrest, saying, ‘I would have carried out an attack and killed a large number of people if I hadn't been arrested.''

The stories of five Golani commandos killed in Lebanon	Two officers and three soldier's of the Golani Brigade Reconnaissance Unit fell in battle against Hezbollah terrorists; these are their stories The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported on Thursday five of the Golani Brigade Reconnaissance Unit’s soldiers were killed in battle in southern Lebanon. According to a military investigation, the troops scanned a building close to the Israel-Lebanon border and were surprised by four Hezbollah terrorists hiding in it, prompting a deadly firefight resulting in three soldiers seriously injured and five who lost their lives. These are their stories: Maj. Ofek Bachar Deep sorrow fell on Ness Ziona following the tragic news of the death of resident Maj. Ofek Bachar. Maj. Bachar, 24, who rose through the ranks in the elite Egoz Unit, had taken on the role of a platoon commander in the Golani Reconnaissance Unit three months ago. His soldiers came to know him as a brave and skilled officer and struggled to process the loss of their commander. Maj. Bachar, is survived by his parents, Ronit and Yehuda and his siblings, Sagi and Ofir. 'Ness Ziona Mayor Shmuel Boxer, the city council members and the entire community send their warmest embrace to the grieving family and will stand by them during these difficult times,' a Ness Ziona Municipality statement read. Capt. Elad Siman Tov The settlement of Tzofim located in the West Bank, received the news of the death of resident Capt. Elad Siman-Tov, 23. a platoon commander in the Golani Reconnaissance Unit, with great sorrow. 'The entire community mourns the loss of Elad, one of our finest sons, right in the middle of the Sukkot holiday,' said Yossi Dagan, head of the Shomron Regional Council. 'Elad was a righteous man, an officer and a commander adored by his soldiers. It's hard to believe.' 'He was a war machine,' one of the officer’s soldiers recalled. 'His soldiers loved him and he loved them, caring for them as if they were his own children.' Staff Sgt. Elyashiv Eitan Wieder Staff Sgt. Elyashiv Eitan Wieder, 22, a resident of Jerusalem who fell alongside four of his comrades from the Golani Reconnaissance Battalion in combat in Lebanon, will be laid to rest at the Mount Herzl Military Cemetery. Last week, Staff Sgt. Wieder celebrated his birthday and said goodbye to his parents, Moti and Yael, for the last time. Staff Sgt. Yehudah Dror Yahalom Sgt. Yehudah Dror Yahalom, 21, a Golani Reconnaissance unit soldier who fell in the fierce battle, will be laid to rest in his hometown of Hebron. Staff Sgt. Yahalom was given his middle name, 'Dror,' after Col. Dror Weinberg, a Hebron Brigade commander who was killed in November 2002. Yahalom enlisted in the elite unit two years ago and returned to active duty even after marrying his wife Shachar. He is survived by his parents, Moshe and Tehila and ten siblings. 'I’ve known Yehudah personally since he was a young boy,' said Hebron Local Council head Eyal Gelman. 'Yehudah was the salt of the earth. A brave hero who fought across all fronts with his unit over the past year.' 'Yehudah contributed greatly to the building of Hebron and the Land of Israel. We embrace his beloved wife, Shachar, Moshe and Tehila, and the entire Yahalom family and will stand by their side in every way in these difficult times,' he added. Staff Sgt. Yaakov Hillel Staff Sgt. Yaakov Hillel, 21, from Jerusalem, was the grandson of the head of the Ahavat Shalom yeshiva — a unique yeshiva dedicated to Kabbalistic teachings — and the son of Rabbi Chaim Hillel, head of the Kollel (institute of advanced Torah study) in Jerusalem’s Neve Yaakov neighborhood.

The deputy or a 'strawman': Sinwar's potential heirs in Hamas	The former Hamas leader's sudden elimination leaves the terror group without strong leadership and could shift the center of power abroad; these are his possible replacements Former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s elimination in Gaza on Thursday is sending the Gazan terror group into freefall with speculation about his possible successor. The list of potential Hamas successors includes various senior figures within the terror organization — most of whom reside in Qatar or other countries. While one of the leading candidates is originally from Gaza, the rest are senior members of the terror group’s politburo, indicating Sinwar’s death could shift the power back to leaders overseas. This marks a change after years where the balance of power leaned toward senior Gazan figures. 'Decisions will be returned to Hamas’ branch abroad, which may help push negotiations for a cease-fire forward,' Hamas sources told Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat. 'Sinwar was a true leader — he would promote and remove figures in the movement at his discretion,' A source close to the terror organization's leadership claimed. 'He took control of decision-making in an extreme manner, which was evident from the moment he became head. Communication with him was difficult, complicated and often disrupted.' Sinwar's potential successor will need to be accepted by the terror group’s leadership abroad and likely have some ties to Iran as well. These are the terror group’s possible candidates: Khaled Mashal One potential contender is Khaled Mashal, considered one of the most powerful figures in Hamas's politburo, although his views have differed from Sinwar's — especially regarding ties with Iran. Mashal currently serves as the leader of Hamas’ foreign branch, and headed its politburo for 21 years, from 1996 to 2017, before deciding to step down. In 2021, he was re-elected as the leader of Hamas’ foreign branch in an attempt to return to the Palestinian political arena. In 1997, he survived an assassination attempt in a botched Mossad operation in Jordan. Khalil al-Hayya Khalil al-Hayya, Sinwar's deputy, left the Gaza Strip before October 7, 2023, and has since been one of the senior figures leading negotiations for a cease-fire and a hostage deal on behalf of the terror organization. Al-Hayya also maintains strong ties with Iran, where he traveled following the terror group’s former politburo member Ismail Haniyeh's assassination to attend his funeral. The New York Times reported that al-Hayya was part of the 'closed military council' Sinwar convened over two years to plan the October 7 attack and acted as a special envoy for classified discussions on the matter with Iran and Hezbollah. According to a Gazan source, al-Hayya is seen as having a strong chance of being appointed head of Hamas’ politburo. 'Sinwar groomed him for the role and brought him closer to Iranian elements that support Hamas,' the source said. 'Al-Hayya's power within the group’s politburo is evident today. He’s considered one of the few Sinwar trusted.' Mousa Abu Marzook Mousa Abu Marzook, who served as Haniyeh's deputy when he was head of Hamas' politburo and is regarded as one of the senior figures in the organization's political wing, lived in the U.S. for many years and has since moved between various Arab capitals. Over the past year, he held a series of interviews worldwide, including one where he said that the tunnels built in Gaza were intended to protect Hamas, not the residents of the Strip. 'It's the UN's responsibility to protect them,' he said. Abu Marzouk also played an important role in negotiations between Israel and Hamas. Unlike Mashal, he isn’t not considered a charismatic or influential 'threat' and was often given a platform and spotlight by Haniyeh on various occasions. A 'strawman' candidate? In August, following Haniyeh’s assassination, Saudi networks reported that the person expected to take over as head of Hamas's political bureau was Muhammad Ismail Darwish, who serves as the head of Hamas' Shura Council. It was later revealed that Darwish wasn’t chosen, with Sinwar taking the role instead. Nevertheless, Hamas released a photo of its Shura Council head meeting with Islamic Jihad leader Ziyad al-Nakhalah last August, about two weeks after Sinwar's appointment as head. One figure less likely to take over Hamas' politburo is his brother, Mohammed Sinwar, who has already likely taken over as head of the terror group's armed wing.

Mohammed Sinwar: The ruthless brother who 'came back from the dea...	People would look at the ground when he walked by,' Gazans say of younger brother of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar; rising through the ranks by earning trust and loyalty, he survived numerous assassination attempts, with rumors of his death falsely circulated in the past In December, a brief video from a 4-kilometer-long (2.5-mile-long) mega-tunnel revealed, for the first time, an image of one of Gaza’s most wanted figures: Mohammed Sinwar, the younger brother of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Since the deaths of senior Hamas military commanders, including Mohammed Deif and Marwan Issa, Mohammed Sinwar has emerged as the de facto second-in-command of Hamas’ leadership in Gaza, propelled by the unwavering support of his brother. Mohammed Sinwar, 49, was born in Khan Younis and was among the earliest recruits to Hamas, participating in acts of terror during the First Intifada. He was imprisoned in Israel for nine months and later spent three years in a Palestinian Authority prison, escaping in 2000. A Gaza source noted that Sinwar grew up under the ideological influence of Hamas co-founder Abd al-Aziz al-Rantisi. The Sinwar brothers share much in common, including the nickname 'Abu Ibrahim,' given to both after their first sons, named after their father, Ibrahim. Mohammed Sinwar became a trusted confidant of Yahya, one of the few who knew his whereabouts during nearly a year of war. His family ties provided him with a smooth path to the top of Hamas, with no suspicions from within the organization of disloyalty. Mohammed Sinwar’s role was first revealed by Hamas in 2005 when the group broke from its tradition of secrecy and disclosed the identities of seven commanders leading attacks against Israelis and IDF forces. Sinwar was named among them as the commander of the Khan Younis Brigade. At the time, Israel reportedly made three assassination attempts on him—through sniper fire, a double airstrike on his home and an explosive device in the wall of his house, which he uncovered. One of Sinwar's most significant operations was orchestrating the abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2006, an event that eventually led to the prisoner exchange deal in which his brother Yahya was freed. At the time of the abduction, Mohammed Sinwar served as the commander of the Khan Younis Brigade, conditioning Shalit’s release on the freedom of his brother Yahya, who would later rise to lead Hamas before his death. Loyalty over ability 'Mohammed became a significant player in Hamas' military wing. When Yahya Sinwar was in Israeli prison, he trusted that Mohammed had control over Shalit. Today, it’s clear that Mohammed’s status within the military wing grew due to his proximity to Yahya—who believes in specific people,' said Dr. Yuval Biton, former head of the Intelligence Division in Israel's prison service who knew Yahya well. 'Yahya doesn’t look at abilities; he looks at loyalty, and that’s what drove Mohammed’s rise in Hamas.' Biton explained that Yahya Sinwar likely sought to consolidate power by surrounding himself with trusted figures in the leadership, allowing him to make decisions without opposition. 'As we approached the Shalit deal, the Sinwar brothers opposed it—even though Yahya’s name was at the top of the release list. Yahya pushed Mohammed to convince the leadership to reject the deal, but Saleh al-Arouri and Khaled Mashal supported it and ultimately overruled the Sinwars,' Biton said, referencing a historical moment that led to Yahya’s eventual leadership of Hamas following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. Israel has made repeated attempts on Mohammed Sinwar’s life over the years. His home was bombed during Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, and again in Operation Protective Edge in 2014, though he was not there. During the latter operation, rumors circulated that Sinwar had been killed, with images claiming to show his dead body. However, Sinwar remained elusive, and his name faded from public view until May 2022. Al Jazeera reported that he had not attended his father’s funeral in January 2022, leading some media outlets to refer to him as 'the one who returned from the dead.' In May 2022, Sinwar reemerged in a brief 30-second interview with Al Jazeera, appearing as a silhouette—a technique used for years by Mohammed Deif. 'When we issue warnings to the occupation or send a message, we mean every word, and every letter has weight and impact on the ground,' Sinwar said. 'Precise and focused efforts have been made to establish this, and important equations have been set. When we say this, we know how to identify the occupation’s soft spots and how to press them. We have succeeded in setting important equations, and the enemy calculates its actions accordingly.' 'People would look at the ground when he walked by' Mohammed Sinwar, often referred to as 'the man who returned from the dead,' has instilled fear among Gaza’s population on multiple occasions. Known for his charismatic yet harsh and intimidating persona, Sinwar commands respect but also terror. 'He’s feared as a man capable of killing without hesitation. This family is known for its hot temper, and Mohammed, in particular, is a frightening figure,' said a source in Gaza. After his brother Yahya was released from Israeli prison in the 2011 Shalit deal, Mohammed’s influence grew. 'Yahya only understands power, and that’s Mohammed’s legacy too. He has been involved in numerous executions of collaborators, as well as brutal interrogations and torture in Hamas prisons,' the source added, describing the Sinwar brothers’ role in internal purges before the current war. 'When Mohammed scolds someone, they are paralyzed with fear. No one in Gaza dares to cross him.' The source noted that people were so terrified of Mohammed Sinwar that they avoided eye contact with him. 'People would look at the ground when he walked by, afraid of how he might interpret even a glance.' Mohammed Sinwar is also accused of overseeing harsh torture in Hamas prisons, along with his brother Yahya. One high-profile case involved the former Hamas commander of the Zeitoun Brigade, Mohammed Shetawi, who was executed in February 2016 for moral offenses. Shetawi was reportedly suspected of collaborating with Israel, potentially providing information that led to an assassination attempt on Mohammed Deif. Another version of events, presented by a different Hamas operative, suggests that Shetawi was executed after he criticized Yahya Sinwar in a security report for operational mistakes that led to the deaths of Hamas leaders. Shetawi was later accused of having relationships with the widows of those killed. Either way, Shetawi was executed under the Sinwar brothers' orders after enduring brutal torture. Inside Hamas' mega-tunnel Mohammed Sinwar played a key role in orchestrating Hamas’ October 7 surprise attack on Israel, making him one of the most wanted figures in Gaza. Considered one of the architects of the massacre, Sinwar has now likely succeeded Mohammed Deif, further sharpening the target on his back. In December, two months into the war, the IDF released rare footage showing Sinwar traveling in a jeep with bodyguards through a massive tunnel network, discovered just hundreds of yards from the Israeli community of Netiv HaAsara and the Erez crossing. He was reportedly receiving a briefing from a team of engineers and tunnel diggers, brought in from Khan Younis for the ambitious tunnel project, and toured the tunnel’s twists and turns. In response, the IDF distributed flyers in Gaza, offering a $300,000 reward for information leading to Sinwar’s capture—$100,000 less than the bounty on his brother Yahya. The flyer also featured Rafa Salama, the Khan Younis Brigade commander, and Mohammed Deif, both killed in Israeli airstrikes in July. Salama had a $200,000 bounty on his head, while Deif's was $100,000. In February, IDF forces raided and completely destroyed Mohammed Sinwar’s office at the Al-Qadisiyah post in Khan Younis. Mohammed Sinwar’s current status remains unclear. While IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi has not named him among the top Hamas leaders, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant did publicly single him out, alongside his brother Yahya, during a visit to the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza last month. 'We will eliminate Hamas, and we will reach Mohammed Sinwar, as well as Yahya Sinwar. We will get to all of these people, these cursed terrorists,' Gallant declared. 'For anyone who thinks otherwise, look at Marwan Issa and Mohammed Deif. They thought they were invincible, and they are no longer with us. They made their mistake, and he will make his too. We will complete our mission.'

Sinwar’s death: A victory tainted by fears for hostages’ fate	Analysis: Hamas leader's unexpected elimination may trigger unforeseen consequences; potential successors, internal uprisings, a Hamas-Iran rift and shifts in Israel’s military strategy are all on the table Shin Bet pressed the IDF to continue operations in the area where Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed, near the tunnel where six hostages were executed in Rafah. Intelligence suggested senior Hamas leaders were hiding in the sector, sometimes even above ground. This assumption ultimately proved correct. While there is satisfaction and even celebration over Sinwar's elimination, Israeli officials are aware that the new reality could bring risks, particularly for the remaining hostages held by Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and other terrorist groups in Gaza. Careless moves or premature announcements by Israel at this sensitive time could endanger the hostages. The fact that Sinwar was killed in a direct confrontation with Israeli forces, rather than by an airstrike, may offer some solace to his fanatic supporters, potentially affecting their treatment of hostages. However, the loss of a charismatic religious leader like Sinwar could also incite retaliation and spur desperate acts of revenge, especially from Gaza residents who saw him as a symbol or even a messianic figure. The immediate concern is for the hostages, who are held by unpredictable factions. Their captors’ reactions to Sinwar’s death remain difficult to anticipate. The successor The future dynamics of Gaza, both in the short and long term, will largely depend on who succeeds Sinwar as Hamas leader in the Palestinian enclave and as head of the organization’s political bureau. A key challenge is finding a figure in Gaza with communication channels open to all factions, particularly the Hamas terrorists holding Israeli hostages, and whose decisions are accepted by the various groups involved. If Sinwar’s brother, Mohammed Sinwar, takes over, it is likely that he will be familiar with his late brother’s communication methods with Hamas leadership abroad, particularly in Doha, Qatar. This could enable Egypt and Qatar to establish contact with him. However, Mohammed Sinwar may not command the same authority as his brother, making it harder for him to prevent the 'privatization' of hostage control by families, organizations and armed groups in Gaza. Each of these groups may have its own ideas on how to use the hostages as leverage for their own interests. Another potential successor is Az al-Din Haddad, commander of Hamas’ Gaza Brigade. One of the few surviving senior leaders of Hamas’ military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, Haddad is known for his charisma and having survived several Israeli assassination attempts. If Haddad replaces Sinwar, his influence on the fate of the hostages could differ. As a native of northern Gaza, Haddad is considered a commander of the region, including Gaza City, which is under heavy attack and siege by the IDF. He may be more open to negotiations involving easing conditions for northern Gaza residents in exchange for progress on hostage talks. This contrasts with Mohammed Sinwar, former Khan Younis commander, who is known for his ruthlessness and unwavering loyalty to his brother. However, it is unclear whether Haddad has the same lines of communication with Hamas' external leadership as Sinwar did, or whether the various groups holding hostages would listen to him, viewing the hostages as their own 'property.' On the other hand, Yahya Sinwar’s death could potentially work in favor of the hostages if their captors realize that their fate could mirror Sinwar’s unless they reach a deal with Israel. The Gaza question Sinwar’s killing has raised questions about how it will impact the achievement of Israel's war objectives and whether it will hasten the end of the war under conditions that ensure security for southern Israel. Sinwar’s death is expected to deliver a major blow to Hamas’ morale and, in the medium term, significantly reduce the terrorist group’s motivation to continue fighting. Sinwar was seen as a mythic Islamic figure, and the loss of such a leader often dampens the resolve of his followers. Historical precedent suggests that the elimination of charismatic figures has long-term effects. For example, PIJ struggled for a decade following the assassination of its leader Fathi Shaqaqi in Malta in the 1990s, carrying out few attacks during that time. Similarly, the killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Iraq led to a retreat of ISIS terrorists from many areas they had controlled. Sinwar’s removal could also embolden many displaced Gazans, now living in dire conditions along the coast in al-Mawasi, to rise up against Hamas, which has diverted humanitarian aid to fund its operations. Both the reaction of Gaza’s population and Hamas terrorists' motivation will depend on who succeeds Sinwar. His brother, Mohammed Sinwar, known like his sibling as 'Abu Ibrahim' after their father, is feared and brutal but lacks his brother’s charisma. Though he was once mentioned as a possible successor to Mohammed Deif after he was killed alongside the Khan Younis brigade commander, Mohammed Sinwar lacks the public authority of other potential leaders, such as Haddad. It is unclear if either of them will be able to assert their authority over Gaza in a way that allows Hamas to maintain its civilian control over large parts of it. If Sinwar’s successor cannot impose order in Gaza or manage humanitarian aid distribution, the Palestinian enclave could descend into chaos, resembling the 'Somalization' of Gaza, where power falls to whoever can assert the most force. Such a scenario would pose a challenge to Israel and a threat to IDF forces, but it might also present an opportunity for Israel to step in, fill the power vacuum and dismantle Hamas’ control in Gaza once and for all. Iranian influence Sinwar was only recently appointed head of Hamas’ political bureau following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. His death leaves behind a critical question: Will Hamas maintain its close relationship with Iran’s mullahs in his absence? During the Syrian Civil War, tensions ran high between Hamas, a Sunni Islamist group, and the Shiite leadership in Tehran, as well as Syria’s Alawite leader, Bashar al-Assad, who is aligned with Shiite Islam. Hamas was expelled from Damascus, where Khaled Mashal led the political bureau, after refusing to support Assad, who had provided refuge to Hamas’ leadership. One of the top contenders to succeed Sinwar as political bureau chief is again Khaled Mashal, currently in Doha. Mashal has long opposed deepening ties with Iran, which could signal a shift in Hamas’ alliances, potentially distancing the group from Tehran and its so-called 'Axis of Resistance.' If Mashal reclaims the leadership role, Hamas may no longer align as closely with Iran’s network of proxies. The uncertainty over Hamas’ leadership could also influence Israeli decision-making regarding potential retaliatory strikes on Iran. While theoretical chances of renewed negotiations might delay action, Israeli officials believe that waiting too long could undermine the legitimacy of a strike, as international attention may quickly fade from Iran’s October 1 missile attack. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the defense establishment argue that momentum should be seized and suggest that Sinwar’s elimination could actually accelerate plans for a strike. Meanwhile, speculation grows over who might be the next target—perhaps Iran’s Revolutionary Guard commander Hossein Salami or even Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei himself. The Palestinian Authority Negotiations are currently underway between the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Hamas' overseas leadership to explore the possibility of establishing civilian governance in Gaza, as an alternative to Hamas' rule. Sinwar’s vision had been for the PA, under Chairman Mahmoud Abbas, to return to Gaza after being ousted by Hamas in the 2007 coup. Under this arrangement, the PA would manage civilian affairs such as health, education and infrastructure, while Hamas would focus on rebuilding its military power to prepare for future attacks against Israel. If Hamas now fully relinquishes its armed control over Gaza, it could present a significant dilemma for the Israeli government. Netanyahu, along with key political allies like Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, are ideologically opposed to PA control in Gaza, fearing it could lead to the establishment of a unified Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Much depends on whether Hamas can appoint a new leader to replace Sinwar, and who that leader will be. Only after this is clear can realistic predictions be made about the future. For now, the news of Sinwar’s death is tempered by concerns for the fate of Israeli hostages and uncertainty over how, if at all, his death will impact the course of the war in Gaza.

Regional states signal increased involvement in post-war Gaza fol...	Foreign leaders note increased willingness to engage in Gaza’s rehabilitation and establishing alternative authority to Hamas; IDF confirms Sinwar tried fleeing north; Biden, Netanyahu agree Sinwar’s killing presents opportunity to advance hostage talks Israel received messages Thursday from several regional countries expressing a stronger interest and motivation to be involved in the post-war governance of Gaza following the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Sinwar’s elimination, seen as a major obstacle, could affect not only hostage negotiations but also future plans for Gaza’s reconstruction and governance. Throughout Thursday, Israeli officials held talks with foreign leaders, including those in the Middle East, noting increased willingness to engage in Gaza’s rehabilitation and in establishing an alternative authority to Hamas. Various Middle Eastern countries have been linked to discussions about Gaza’s future. In May, The New York Times reported that senior aides to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu explored a post-war plan involving shared control of Gaza with the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the U.S., in exchange for normalization with Saudi Arabia. However, in September, UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed cast doubt on the plan, saying his country would not support post-war efforts in Gaza without the establishment of a Palestinian state. Meanwhile, Israeli officials believe Hamas' overseas leadership has now become the central player in the hostage negotiations, making the pressure from mediators more effective after Sinwar’s death. The U.S. views Sinwar’s killing as an opportunity to expedite the war’s conclusion and facilitate a hostage deal. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed the matter with his Qatari counterpart. One of the key questions following Sinwar's death is what will be done with his body. Israel has yet to make a decision, but officials familiar with the matter suggested that if required during hostage negotiations, Israel would be willing to return Sinwar’s body as part of a deal. Israeli officials speculated that Sinwar may have been planning to flee to Egypt, pointing to forged passports found at the location where he was killed. There had been significant concern in Israel over the possibility of Sinwar being on the run and disconnected from his organization. However, in a statement, the IDF confirmed that Sinwar had been 'in flight and trying to escape north.' In a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, it was revealed that U.S. President Joe Biden called Netanyahu from Air Force One to congratulate him on the successful operation. Biden reportedly praised the IDF's efforts, and the two leaders agreed on the importance of seizing this opportunity to secure the release of the hostages, committing to work together toward that goal.

IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari confirmed Thursday night that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in Tel Sultan by IDF soldiers the day before. 'For months, the IDF and Shin Bet gathered intelligence to eliminate Sinwar, the mastermind behind the October 7 massacre. He was hiding in the area, and we didn’t know he was there. We identified Sinwar as a terrorist inside a building, found him with a vest, a pistol and 40,000 shekels. He was on the run, and we eliminated him. No hostages were with him.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syn00wxkl1l	2024-10-17T13:23:37-07:00

The only deal on the table is Hamas’ full surrender, the release of hostages and the exile of the remaining terrorists,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byqiygyg1x	2024-10-17T13:13:04-07:00	
Biden heads to Germany for talks on Ukraine, Middle East	U.S. President Joe Biden took off for Berlin on Thursday for a short visit to discuss Russia's invasion of Ukraine with the leaders of Germany, France and Britain as Kyiv urges its Western allies to take immediate action to end the fighting. The conflict in the Middle East is also expected to be high on the agenda in talks between the leaders, as the Biden administration hopes Israel's killing of Hamas official Yahya Sinwar could bring a ceasefire in Gaza closer to fruition. Biden had originally been scheduled to convene a broader meeting of Ukraine's military supporters at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany last week during a planned three-day state visit to the country that would have been the first in nearly 40 years. He canceled that trip to focus on dealing with Hurricane Milton but is making up for it with the quick visit this week. The Ramstein meeting will be held virtually in November, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One. The president now will land late on Thursday in Berlin and hold bilateral talks on Friday morning with Germany's president and chancellor, before a planned meeting with the leaders of Germany, France and Britain.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1y1keyeje	2024-10-17T13:09:59-07:00	
US to kickstart Gaza cease-fire talks after Sinwar's death, State...	The United States wants to kickstart talks on a proposal to achieve a cease-fire and the release of hostages in Gaza, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Thursday, after the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, which he called a 'seismic event.' Miller told a regular press briefing that Sinwar had been the 'chief obstacle' to reaching an end to the war, which began when Sinwar orchestrated an attack on southern Israel in which Palestinian terrorists killed about 1,200 people and took 250 hostages. The Biden administration has worked unsuccessfully for months with mediators Qatar and Egypt to try to reach a deal that would see Israel cease operations in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages taken by Hamas in the attack just over a year ago. In recent weeks, Sinwar had refused to negotiate at all, Miller said. 'That obstacle has obviously been removed. Can't predict that that means whoever replaces (Sinwar) will agree to a cease-fire, but it does remove what has been in recent months the chief obstacle to getting one,' he said. Washington would now 'redouble' its efforts and try to push forward the cease-fire proposal 'that has been on the table for some time,' Miller said, without detailing the proposal.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1t00ry1ekl	2024-10-17T13:08:41-07:00

Sinwar’s desperate last moments: Tried to down drone with stick b...	IDF forces identify 3 terrorists in Rafah, opening fire as Hamas leader flees to nearby building and hides on second floor; his body found during sweeps day after; Bislach soldier severely wounded in incident WARNING: This article contains graphic images. The encounter that led to the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar on Wednesday was part of the IDF’s ongoing efforts to locate and destroy tunnels in Rafah. Sinwar was killed after the building he was in collapsed on top of him, as well as shrapnel from two types of munitions: a Merkava Mark 4 tank shell fired by the 460th Brigade and a Matador missile made by Israeli defense contractor Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. The incident began around 10 a.m. when a 450th Battalion soldier spotted a suspicious figure entering and exiting a building, alerting his commander, who ordered fire in response. At 3 p.m., IDF forces, using a drone, identified three figures leaving the building, attempting to move from house to house. Two figures were covered with blankets, walking ahead of Sinwar to clear the way. The 450th Battalion commander opened fire on the group, causing them to scatter. Two terrorists fled into one building, and Sinwar into another. Sinwar moved to the second floor of the building, and the IDF responded by firing a tank shell at it. As the IDF Infantry Commanders School (Bislach) unit began to sweep the building, two grenades were thrown at them—one exploded, the other did not. The troops pulled back and sent a drone, which detected an injured figure, face covered, sitting in a room and attempting to knock the drone out of the air with a stick. The next sweep of the building occurred at dawn, when troops discovered a body with recognizable features, leading to the identification process, which was completed in the evening. 'We knew Sinwar’s estimated location for a while despite the high level of secrecy Hamas maintained around him,' said an IDF official. 'We knew he had been in Rafah, and we focused on uncovering the underground infrastructure there to find him.' The IDF also revealed that 'a few weeks ago, in a similar underground operation, we discovered a room with evidence suggesting Sinwar had been in the same complex. Even yesterday, we weren’t sure if Sinwar had escaped to Khan Younis. This is a significant achievement that should translate into a strategic one.' The IDF is still investigating the identity of the two terrorists who were with Sinwar, and it remains unclear whether one was a Hamas battalion commander. 'Hamas continued operating even when Sinwar was out of contact,' the army official noted. 'There are other senior figures within Hamas, and they have a structured chain of command. There’s Hamas abroad, and Sinwar's brother, Mohammed.' The Bislach commander who led the sweep and identified Sinwar was wounded at the beginning of the war when he joined the fight at the Gaza border, losing soldiers in the same battle. During Wednesday's encounter that led to Sinwar’s death, a soldier from the 450th Battalion was severely injured by gunfire from the two terrorists who escaped into a nearby building. The wounded soldier, a resident of a Druze village in northern Israel, was evacuated to Soroka Medical Center in Be’er Sheva, where he is currently in intensive care. His condition is stable, with a gunshot wound to his upper body. His father said the soldier's commanders had briefed the family on the events. 'My son was the first to engage, and they attacked him. He was later struck by a bullet. He’s not speaking yet but communicates with us using his hands,' he said. The soldier's uncle called him 'a hero of Israel' and said, 'For a year they hunted Sinwar, and now they’ve got him.' Earlier Thursday, the IDF officially confirmed Sinwar’s killing in Rafah’s Tel Sultan neighborhood. 'The leader of the Hamas terrorist organization, responsible for the October 7 massacre, has been eliminated,' a statement read. 'Sinwar orchestrated and executed the deadly attack and promoted his murderous ideology throughout the war and beforehand, making him responsible for the murder and abduction of many Israelis.' The IDF and Shin Bet highlighted that 'Sinwar was killed after a year of hiding within Gaza’s civilian population, both above ground and in Hamas tunnels. The dozens of operations carried out by the IDF and Shin Bet over the past year, and particularly in recent weeks, restricted Sinwar’s movement and led to his elimination.' In a recorded statement following Sinwar’s killing, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, 'The man responsible for the worst massacre in our people's history since the Holocaust has been killed. We have settled the score with him. Evil has taken a hard blow, but our mission is not yet complete.' Addressing Gaza’s residents and the terrorists holding hostages, he added, 'Sinwar destroyed your lives. He told you he was a lion, but in reality, he hid in a dark den—and he was killed while fleeing in panic from our soldiers. His elimination marks an important milestone in the downfall of Hamas' reign of evil.'

Cash, UNRWA ID, weapons—and Mentos: The items found on Sinwar’s b...	IDF forces discover large sums of cash, identification documents and numerous weapons alongside bodies of slain Hamas leader and senior terrorists killed with him during Rafah operation Large amounts of cash, an UNRWA ID card and various weapons were discovered alongside the bodies of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and senior terrorists killed with him in Rafah’s Tel Sultan neighborhood, the IDF confirmed Thursday. Also found at the scene were Mentos candies. The IDF officially confirmed Sinwar’s killing after his body was identified. In the statement, the IDF said, 'Sinwar orchestrated the October 7 massacre and promoted his murderous ideology both before and during the war, making him responsible for the murder and abduction of many Israelis.' According to the IDF and Shin Bet, Sinwar had been hiding for a year among Gaza’s civilian population, both above ground and in Hamas tunnels. Numerous operations by the IDF and Shin Bet over the past year, particularly in the weeks leading up to his death, restricted his movements and eventually led to his elimination. Unlike other high-profile assassinations during Operation Iron Swords, such as those of Mohammed Deif and Hassan Nasrallah, Sinwar’s killing resulted from an unplanned encounter. Soldiers from the Infantry Commanders and Combat Training School (Bislach), conducting a counterterrorism sweep, identified and killed three terrorists in a booby-trapped building, unaware that one of them was Sinwar. Ynet military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai reported that Shin Bet had insisted the IDF continue operations in Tel Sultan, suspecting Hamas leaders might be present, sometimes even above ground. An earlier airstrike had targeted a tunnel in the area where the IDF believed Sinwar was hiding, but he was not found there. The bodies of the terrorists were first examined using drones due to the presence of explosives. One body resembled Sinwar, leading soldiers to suspect they had killed the Hamas leader by chance. To confirm Sinwar’s identity, soldiers took photographs of the body, which were sent to the police forensic unit. As first reported by Ynet, Sinwar’s identity was confirmed through dental records, with fingerprint analysis later corroborating the identification. Another key indicator of Sinwar’s presence was the identity of one of the terrorists killed alongside him, who was known to be close to the Hamas leader. According to reports from Gaza, the two other terrorists killed were Sinwar’s bodyguards, one of whom was also a teacher for UNRWA, while the other was a senior official in Hamas' National Security Office. It was later reported that one of the terrorists might have been Muhammad Shabana, the commander of Hamas' Rafah Brigade.

Trump blames Ukraine's Zelensky for starting war with Russia	Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump on Thursday blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for helping start that nation's war with Russia, a comment that further suggests Trump is likely to radically shift U.S. policy toward Ukraine if he wins the Nov. 5 election. The former president has frequently criticized Zelensky on the campaign trail, repeatedly calling him 'the greatest salesman on Earth' for having solicited and received billions of dollars of U.S. military aid since the war broke out in 2022. Trump has also slammed the Ukrainian leader for failing to seek peace with Moscow, and he has suggested Ukraine may have to cede some of its land to Russia to make a peace deal, a concession Kyiv considers unacceptable. Trump's comments on the PBD Podcast on Thursday with Patrick Bet-David went a step further than his previous criticism. He said Zelensky was to blame not just for failing to end the war, but for helping start it, even though the conflict broke out when Russia invaded Ukrainian sovereign territory. 'That doesn't mean I don't want to help him because I feel very badly for those people. But he should never have let that war start. The war's a loser,' Trump said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r10we1jx1g	2024-10-17T12:09:15-07:00

IDF names 5 Golani commandos killed in fierce battle in southern ...	Maj. Ofek Bachar, Capt. Elad Siman Tov, Staff Sgt. Elyashiv Eitan Wieder, Staff Sgt. Yakov Hillel and Staff Sgt. Yehudah Dror Yahalom, all of the Golani Brigade Reconnaissance Unit, reportedly ambushed by terrorists while sweeping building for terror infrastructure Five elite Golani Brigade soldiers were killed on Wednesday during an intense firefight in a southern Lebanese village near the Israeli border, the IDF reported on Thursday. Among the fallen, all of the Golani Brigade Reconnaissance Unit, were Maj. Ofek Bachar, 24, a company commander, from Nes Ziona; Capt. Elad Siman Tov, 23, a platoon commander, from Tzofim; Staff Sgt. Elyashiv Eitan Wieder, 22, a squad commander, from Jerusalem; Staff Sgt. Yaakov Hillel, 21, from Jerusalem; and Staff Sgt. Yehudah Dror Yahalom, 21, from Hebron. According to an initial IDF probe, the Golani Reconnaissance Unit entered a multi-story building in a Lebanese village near the western sector of the border at around 5 p.m. The mission was based on intelligence reports indicating the presence of terrorist infrastructure. As the unit approached, the building came under aerial fire. Roughly 30 minutes into the search, during which the soldiers discovered several weapons caches and underground positions, gunfire erupted from a stairwell. Four Hezbollah terrorists, who had concealed themselves in the building, opened fire at close range. The ensuing firefight resulted in the deaths of the five soldiers, including the company commander. The Golani troops returned fire, killing the terrorists. Three soldiers were pronounced dead at the scene, while two others later succumbed to their injuries at the hospital. Five additional soldiers were wounded, including the company's deputy commander, with three sustaining serious injuries. Air support provided cover fire, allowing medevac helicopters to extract the casualties to a hospital in Israel within an hour. The IDF is now investigating how the Hezbollah terrorists evaded detection during the building sweep, despite the soldiers' professional conduct. Golani Brigade forces have been operating in southern Lebanon for two weeks, initially in the village of Maroun al-Ras before expanding to other areas to neutralize Hezbollah's Radwan forces, which pose an invasion threat to northern Israel. The troops have uncovered and destroyed advanced Hezbollah weaponry near the border and killed more than 10 Hezbollah militants in recent days. In separate incidents, a soldier from the Golani Brigade's 12th Battalion and a reservist officer from the 6th Brigade's 8173rd Battalion were seriously wounded in fighting in southern Lebanon. Two additional reservists from the 8173rd Battalion were also wounded.

Netanyahu: Sinwar's killing marks 'beginning of day after Hamas'	In video statement, PM calls Hamas leader's death turning point in war and urges Gaza residents to release hostages or face consequences, declaring collapse of Hamas rule imminent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday evening called the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar a pivotal moment in the ongoing war and the 'beginning of the day after Hamas.' 'Sinwar ruined your lives,' he said in a video statement, addressing Gaza’s residents. 'Hamas will no longer rule Gaza. This is the beginning of the day after Hamas. 'The mastermind behind the worst massacre of our people since the Holocaust, a murderer responsible for the deaths of thousands of Israelis and the abduction of hundreds, has been eliminated by our heroic soldiers.' He reassured the families of the hostages, saying, 'This is an important moment in the war. We will continue with all our strength until your loved ones, who are also our loved ones, are brought home. This is our highest commitment.' Netanyahu called on Gaza’s residents to release the hostages. 'Sinwar’s elimination marks a significant milestone in the collapse of Hamas’ rule,' he said. 'To the terrorists, I say: Your leaders are fleeing, and they will be eliminated. I call on anyone holding our hostages—lay down your weapons and return them, and you will be allowed to leave and live. But if you harm our hostages, you will be held accountable, and your fate will be sealed.' Meanwhile, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, speaking at the Gaza border, also called on Gaza residents to surrender. 'Sinwar ended his life beaten, hunted and fleeing, not as a commander but as someone who only cared for himself,' he said. 'This is a clear message to the families of the fallen and the hostages, as well as to Gaza residents: the man who brought disaster upon you is gone. Now is the time to release the hostages and surrender. Israel has closed a long-standing account with Sinwar—a vile murderer who planned and executed the October 7 massacre.' President Isaac Herzog commended the IDF, Shin Bet and security forces for the killing of Sinwar.

IDF confirms Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar killed in Gaza operation	Military and Shin Bet confirm arch-terrorist killed on Wednesday in clash with Israeli forces in southern Gaza where operations intensified based on intelligence pinpointing whereabouts of senior Hamas leaders The IDF and Shin Bet confirmed Thursday that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in an operation in southern Gaza the day before after a year-long manhunt. Sinwar, the mastermind behind the October 7 massacre and responsible for the abduction and murder of numerous Israelis, was eliminated by IDF soldiers from the Southern Command. According to a statement, Sinwar had evaded capture for the past year, hiding among Gaza's civilian population and within Hamas’ underground tunnel network. His operational movement was increasingly restricted by a series of IDF and Shin Bet operations, leading to his eventual elimination. In recent weeks, IDF and Shin Bet forces, under Southern Command, intensified operations in southern Gaza based on intelligence pinpointing the whereabouts of senior Hamas leaders. Soldiers from the IDF’s 828th Brigade encountered and killed three terrorists during the operation. After identifying the body, officials confirmed that one of the terrorists was Yahya Sinwar.

Israeli shekel surges on reports of Sinwar's death	Reports of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s killing led to an immediate strengthening of the Israeli shekel against foreign currencies on Thursday evening. Two days after a negative inflation report reduced the likelihood of the Bank of Israel raising interest rates, the shekel gained strength without any rate hike. The dollar dropped by nearly 0.75% in after-hours trading, settling at around 3.73 shekels compared to the earlier official exchange rate of 3.7630 set before the Sukkot holiday, which had seen a 0.4% increase. Against the euro, the shekel strengthened even further, rising by approximately 1.4% to trade at around 4.03 shekels, compared to the official rate of 4.0956 shekels set before the holiday, which had seen a 0.2% increase. The shekel's rise follows news that IDF forces killed three terrorists in Gaza during a surprise encounter, including Sinwar, the leader of Hamas.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1gzj6rk1e	2024-10-17T09:45:28-07:00

Hamas leader reportedly hid in same tunnel as hostages Hirsch Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Almog Sarusi, Carmel Gat and Alex Lobanov before they were killed by captors in August; IDF investigating whether hostages murdered during Sinwar’s escape Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was likely killed in an IDF raid Thursday, had been in a Rafah tunnel with six Israeli hostages—Hirsch Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Almog Sarusi, Carmel Gat and Alex Lobanov—who were executed by their captors in late August. Israeli authorities have evidence placing Sinwar in the tunnel where the hostages were held, though it remains unclear when he left. The IDF is investigating whether the hostages were killed during his escape. The bodies of the six hostages were discovered with gunshot wounds to the head and other parts of their bodies, with signs of mistreatment. Some bore indications of prior injuries from their initial capture that had been treated. One of the hostages showed signs of being tied up, and the condition of the bodies suggested they had been neglected for an extended period. Sinwar's death came during a surprise encounter in Gaza, where IDF soldiers killed three terrorists, initially unaware that one of them was Sinwar. His identity was later confirmed, and his body is being transported to Israel. Michal Lobanov, the widow of Alex Lobanov, reacted to the news on Instagram, writing: 'Keeping such a huge secret inside, knowing he surrounded himself with you, our angels—he chose you, he killed you, he destroyed our lives. My love, now my circle is complete. Nothing will ease the pain, but now you can celebrate up there. Celebrate, it's over. But please, let the hostages come home. This victory isn’t sweet without them.' Gil Dikman, cousin of Carmel Gat, added: 'The account isn’t settled until the last hostage is returned.'

Sinwar’s body identified by dental records: Meet the soldiers who...	Without prior intelligence, IDF Bislah troops encounter and kill 3 terrorists during counterterrorism operation, later realizing they may have eliminated Hamas leader and October 7 massacre mastermind WARNING: This article contains graphic images. The soldiers responsible for what is likely one of the most significant Israeli military achievements in the Gaza Strip since the start of the war are from the IDF's Infantry Commanders and Combat Training School, commonly known by its Hebrew acronym Bislah. While clearing a terrorist stronghold, the troops identified and eliminated three terrorists in a booby-trapped building, which had previously been partially demolished by the IDF. IDF forces discovered large amounts of Israeli cash and identifying documents on the terrorists' bodies. Due to the presence of explosives and grenades, drones were initially used to examine the bodies. One of the terrorists bore a strong resemblance to Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, leading troops to believe they may have killed him unintentionally, without prior intelligence. The exact location of the raid remains undisclosed for security reasons. To confirm Sinwar’s identity, soldiers photographed the body and sent the images to the Israeli police’s forensic unit. Assistant Commissioner Aliza Raziel, head of the unit, confirmed that the teeth in the photos matched Sinwar's dental records from his time in Israeli custody. 'We had Sinwar’s dental data on file, and the match was clear,' Raziel said. 'This was one of the most significant moments this year, allowing us to quickly provide critical information to the field.' Further evidence suggesting Sinwar’s death included the presence of a senior Hamas commander known to frequently accompany him. Reports from Gaza indicated the other two terrorists killed were Sinwar’s bodyguards, one of whom worked as a teacher for UNRWA and the other a high-ranking official in Hamas’ National Security Office. The IDF confirmed the killing of three terrorists and is investigating whether one was Sinwar. The military clarified that, despite rumors, the terrorists’ identities have not yet been officially verified and that no hostages were found at the site. Senior Israeli officials later said that the chances Sinwar was killed were 'very high.' A spokesperson for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that families of the hostages had been informed that no hostages were present at the scene. 'Sinwar was likely killed, and Israel remains committed to pursuing all those responsible for the October 7 attacks,' a senior official added. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant posted a brief message on X (formerly Twitter), quoting the Bible: ''You will chase your enemies, and they will fall by the sword before you.' Leviticus 26:7.' The post was accompanied by images of senior terrorist leaders Mohammed Deif and Hassan Nasrallah marked with an X, and another image of an X on a black background—an apparent reference to the potential killing of Sinwar.

Reports of Sinwar’s death cause confusion in Arab media	Despite no official confirmation, Arab media outlets quick to declare Hamas leader dead; terror group yet to respond to reports; while some Palestinians celebrate online, others remark he likely died above ground, not in tunnels Reports of the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar on Tuesday have left Arab media in confusion. While speculation grows that Sinwar was killed, Israeli officials have yet to confirm it officially. However, some Arab outlets, citing unnamed sources, quickly published claims that Sinwar had been killed, with several relying on photos from the scene. Hamas has so far declined to comment or confirm whether Sinwar was among those killed. Social media users in Gaza and across the Arab world reacted with skepticism to the reports, especially those from Israeli media. Some expressed hope the identification was wrong, with one post reading, 'God, let it not be him, may he remain a thorn in the filthy occupier's throat.' Others admitted that the resemblance between Sinwar and the body in the circulated images was undeniable, saying, 'It seems to be him.' On Arab social networks, some praised Sinwar, the mastermind behind the October 7 massacre, for reportedly dying in battle rather than hiding in tunnels. 'Sinwar became a martyr in combat, not in a tunnel,' one post read. Arab media outlets primarily echoed Israeli reports, with Asharq Al-Awsat noting that the Israeli military was investigating whether Sinwar had been killed by chance, while Sky News Arabia went further, reporting, 'A source confirmed to Sky News Arabia that Sinwar was killed in a clash with Israeli forces in Rafah.'

Yahya Sinwar: The end of the October 7 massacre mastermind	Sentenced to hundreds of years for murdering Palestinians, he spent 22 years in Israeli prison, where he had brain surgery; released in the 2011 Shalit deal, he quickly rose through Hamas' ranks; Now, Israel believes the arch-terrorist is likely dead For 22 years, Yahya Sinwar was imprisoned in Israel, where he underwent a life-saving surgery. Released in the 2011 Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange deal, Sinwar quickly rose through Hamas' ranks in Gaza. In 2017, he was elected to lead Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and just months ago, he was appointed head of the terrorist group's political bureau. Now, Israeli military and intelligence forces are investigating whether Sinwar—the mastermind behind the October 7 massacre—was killed during an IDF operation in Gaza. Israeli officials estimate the likelihood of his death as 'very high.' Born in the Khan Younis refugee camp in October 1962, the same camp as senior Hamas commander Mohammed Deif, Sinwar co-founded Hamas' internal security wing, Majd, responsible for identifying Palestinian collaborators with Israel. As a 'successful' hunter of collaborators, Sinwar personally executed over 10 Palestinians suspected of working with Israeli authorities. It was these murders, rather than the killing of Israelis, that led to his arrest and 1989 sentencing to five life terms in prison—earning him the nickname 'The Butcher of Khan Younis.' In 1987, Sinwar received a tip that a man named Rasmi Salim had 'abandoned Islam.' He sought permission from Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin to kill Salim, then tracked him with other operatives, kidnapping him at knifepoint. Under violent interrogation by Sinwar, Salim allegedly confessed to collaborating with Israel and acting against Islamic principles, after which Sinwar and his associates executed him. In 2008, while in Israeli prison, Sinwar underwent surgery to remove a brain tumor. He was released in 2011 as part of the Gilad Shalit exchange, and upon returning to Gaza, his rapid rise to power began. In a speech following his release, Sinwar called on Hamas’ military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, to continue kidnapping Israeli soldiers to secure the release of more Palestinian prisoners. 'The release of prisoners will only be achieved through the kidnapping of Jews and swapping them,' he said, predicting that such exchanges were much closer than expected. Sinwar quickly consolidated power in Gaza, gaining support and becoming Hamas' most powerful figure in 2017, eclipsing Ismail Haniyeh. Under his leadership, Hamas in Gaza overtook Hamas' external leadership, shifting the center of power within the organization. Earlier this year, following Haniyeh’s assassination in late July, Sinwar was elected head of the entire Hamas movement. In 2018, Sinwar gave a rare interview with Italian journalist Francesca Borri, saying, 'War is not in anyone’s interest, certainly not ours. Who wants to confront a nuclear power with slingshots? War achieves nothing,' while adding, 'I won’t say I won’t fight again, but I don’t want more wars. I want the siege to end. My first commitment is to my people—to defend them and their right to freedom and independence.' Sinwar is also believed to have orchestrated the deadly October 7 terror attacks. Earlier this month, it was revealed that for over two years, he convened senior Hamas officials in a special 'military council' where they meticulously planned the attack. The New York Times reported that the protocols of these meetings, which were captured by the IDF in a tunnel Sinwar had used to escape, detailed Hamas’ preparations and deception campaign aimed at misleading Israel about its intentions. Since the attack, Israeli forces have been hunting Sinwar. In February, IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari revealed footage of Sinwar, uncovered by Israeli ground forces in Gaza, showing him three days into the war alongside his brother Ibrahim, one of his wives and children. Presenting the video, Hagari said, 'This footage is a result of our pursuit of Sinwar. The manhunt will not stop until we capture him, dead or alive. We are determined to get him.' Sinwar’s younger brother, Mohammed, 48, founded Hamas’ security apparatus and was behind the 2006 kidnapping of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. During Shalit’s captivity, Mohammed reportedly swore to his associates in Khan Younis, 'If I don’t bring Yahya back to our mother, there will be no deal.' Mohammed Sinwar remains one of Hamas’ top officials in Gaza today.

Western diplomats warn against prolonged Lebanon war	Envoys say UNIFIL mandate in the 2006 UN resolution must be amended and ask Israelis not to give Hezbollah an excuse to remain a major player in Lebanon by occupying territory there; say many hope to see the back of the terror group Western diplomats voiced concerns that the fighting in Lebanon could turn into a prolonged war. They expressed distrust of Israel's claims that the offensive in South Lebanon was a limited one, which could explain the fierce opposition of UNIFIL to remove its forces from the fighting. The diplomats agreed that the peacekeepers' mandate was insufficient and said it would have to be amended in a future agreement. They said that despite the severe blow inflicted on Hezbollah recently, the terror group has a leadership that can make decisions. 'There is an understanding in the international community of the severity of the threat from Hezbollah. There must clearly be a different solution in South Lebanon and the situation cannot return to what it was. The West must examine how it can contribute to negotiations.' The diplomats said many in Lebanon would be happy to see the last of Hezbollah but an Israeli occupation of Lebanese territory would only justify Hezbollah's position to act. 'Don't give them excuses,' they said. 'Israel needs a system to enforce a new deal, that includes boots on the ground,' they said adding that Israel is wrong not to be in dialogue with allies and cannot achieve all of its goals in Lebanon. 'Israel had successes and must use them as leverage to reach an agreement.'

PM says Israel and France should work together to return stability to Lebanon, asks how many Hezbollah missiles UNIFIL managed to prevent and slams Macron for distorting history Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said France should change its position and stand by Israel so that the two countries can work together to bring stability back to Lebanon. Netanyahu spoke with the French daily Le Figaro after French President Emmanuel Macron criticized the Israeli leader in a closed government meeting, saying that Israel was created by a UN decision and thus cannot disregard UN resolutions. In response, Netanyahu's office issued a statement criticizing Macron's remarks and evoking the French government's collaboration with the Nazis occupation during World War II. Netanyahu told Le Figaro that Israel does not receive weapons from France and expects its nearing allies to support its fight against the terror of Iran and its proxies. He said the fight against Hamas, Hezbollah and the Iranian regime is a fight for the values Israel and Europeans share. The prime minister also said Macron had distorted history in his remarks and said the United Nation's recognition of the right of the Jewish people to a homeland did not create the state of Israel. 'The Jewish people were connected to the land of Israel for 3,500 years and the state was established by those who fought for its independence including Holocaust survivors. He repeated his position that Israel must maintain security control from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. Netanyahu also said Israel was not opposed to the presence of UNIFIL forces in Lebanon but claimed Hezbollah used the peacekeepers' positions to for protection as they launched missiles against Israel and had dug underground tunnels and fortifications where large amounts of the newest Russian-made weapons were stored. He told the French publication that since the end of the 2006 Second Lebanon war, and the security council's vote to pass resolution 1701, it was not enforced at all. 'How many Hezbollah missiles had UNIFIL prevented? Zero,' he said. Netanyahu told Le Figaro that a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia was possible and could come earlier than expected.

German warship shoots down drone off Lebanon	corvette Ludwigshafen am Rhein deployed with UNIFIL peacekeepers; German defense ministry says drone parts being taken out of the sea for inspection A German warship operating as part of the UNIFIL peacekeepers mission on Thursday shot down a drone off the coast of Lebanon, the Defense Ministry in Berlin said. 'The corvette brought an unidentified unmanned aerial vehicle into the water in a controlled crash,' the spokesperson said, reporting no damage to the German vessel or its crew. 'The corvette Ludwigshafen am Rhein is continuing its duties,' he added. Germany's DPA news agency reported the incident and said the ship's defense systems shot down the unidentified unmanned aircraft. This was the first time the corvette was involved in a military incident in years and also the first reported incident of a drone being shot down by anyone other than the IDF. According to the report, the drone was shot down northeast of the Lebanese border town of Al Naqoura, at some distance from the shore, and at a close proximity to the German ship. Parts of the drone were retrieved from the sea and were being examined. There are 60 German crew members and additional soldiers onboard the vessel. The incident comes as Israel faces international outrage after incidents of shots fired by the IDF at peacekeepers in South Lebanon. Israel denied targeting the UNIFIL troops and said it repeatedly asked the forces to withdraw from the area where fighting against Hezbollah was underway, to avoid harm. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hezbollah was using UNIFIL positions as cover for their attacks against Israel. Italy's defense minister said on Thursday that the U.N. peacekeeping mission to Lebanon is vital to ending the war in the region and needs to be strengthened and not withdrawn from combat zones as Israel has demanded. 'Israel needs to understand that these (U.N.) soldiers are not working for any one side. They are there to help maintain peace and promote regional stability,' Defense Minister Guido Crosetto told parliament on Thursday. He said the resolution establishing the UNIFIL mandate was last revised in 2006 and needed updating. 'UNIFIL is a complex mission with a mandate that is difficult to implement, has inadequate rules of engagement and forces that are not equipped for the current conflict,' he said. Crosetto has called on the United Nations to update its operational capacity, including creating a rapid deployment force to enhance UNIFIL's freedom of movement and give them more firepower. 'The practical disconnect between the assigned mission and the capacity to implement it makes it more necessary than ever to rethink and strengthen UNIFIL,' Crosetto said. Italian President Giorgia Meloni was due to visit Beirut on Friday.

Iranian Foreign Minister visits Cairo a day after Egypt's intelli...	Arqchi reportedly prepares visit to Egypt of Iranian president; officials in Jerusalem concerned after long-serving Abbas Kamal leaves mediator role during crisis in Israel-Egypt relations Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi arrived in Cairo on Thursday to meet Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and his counterpart Badr Abdelatty. This was the first official visit to Egypt by a senior Iranian minister in a decade. The president's palace said the meeting focused on regional developments, with al-Sisi reiterating Egypt's call to avoid the expansion of conflict and the need to halt escalation to prevent a full-scale regional war. 'Araqchi emphasized the importance of continuing efforts to explore prospects for mutual development of relations between the two countries,' the statement added. Araqchi arrived for 'important talks with Egypt's high-ranking officials that will be held tomorrow,' Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said in a post on X on Wednesday, after stops in countries including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iraq and Lebanon. The Qatari Al Araby al Jadeed reported that the minister was preparing a visit by Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian. Relations between Egypt and Iran have generally been fraught in recent decades but the two countries have stepped up high-level diplomatic contacts since the eruption of the Gaza crisis last year as Egypt tried to play a mediating role. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty traveled to Tehran in July to attend the country's presidential inauguration. The visit comes just one day after the announcement in Cairo that al Sisi decided to replace his long-time Intelligence chief Abbas Kamel who was an active participant in the mediation efforts to secure a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza. Israeli officials said they were concerned about the move. Kamel who has been head General Intelligence agency since 2018, was a well-known and respected figure in Jerusalem who had strong ties to Israeli and American security officials. Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar met Kamel in Cairo earlier in the week. Kamel who had recently asked to delegate some of his heavy workload after suffering health problems, according to reports, will be appointed an advisor to the president and is to be replaced by Major General Hassan Mahmoud Rashad who had previously been his deputy. Rashad is not known in Israel and he is stepping into his new role at a time when Israeli-Egyptian relations are in crisis over the war in Gaza and the Israeli insistence to control the Gaza-Egypt border and the Philadelphi Corridor that runs along it. Negotiations to bring a cease-fire in the Gaza war have also stalled and according to the Qatari prime minister, there has been no discussion with the parties to the conflict in over three weeks. 'Basically in the last three to four weeks, there is no conversation or engagement at all, and we are just moving in the same circle with the silence from all parties,' Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday.

How Israel-Norway relations crashed| 'Since the Oslo Accords, we'...	From strong affinity and alliance, Norway's positions shift to support of Hamas, an arms embargo and international arrest warrants for Israeli leaders although some in the Jewish community insist government positions differ from public sentiments It wasn’t always this way. The collapse of Israel-Norway relations - as illustrated in recent months with Norway’s recognition of a Palestinian state and Israel’s diplomatic blitz against Norway – is reminiscent of an ugly divorce, each partner taking out their years of pent-up anger and resentment on the other. It began as a love story between two countries who found common ground, caring for one another and optimistically trying to bring peace to the Middle East. Three decades later, the experiment blew up in dissolution. 'I think Norway’s unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state is an admission of failure,' says Hilde Henriksen Waage (65) of Oslo University, a leading expert on Israel-Norway relations and the Oslo process in Norway. 'After the Cold War, in Norway, there was a desire to build up an image to make it stand out and remind the US that we’re here, that we’re more than a border with Russia and that contrary to our geographical location, we’re in the middle of the action. It was decided we’d offer the world peace. And it’s failed. Not only is there no peace, but things have gotten much worse. And the finger’s being pointed entirely at Israel’s current government.' Norway’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andreas Kravik views Norway’s unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state somewhat differently: 'We did it to advance peace and recognition between Israel and Palestine. This is something we’re committed to,' he says. 'We saw that the Oslo Accords took negative directions that have created a lack of security for both Israelis and Palestinians. So, we were forced to think differently about how to embolden the moderate elements, weakened in this brutal conflict. Both sides deserve peace, but there’ll be no peace without a two-state solution. And as the war in Gaza rages on, we have to preserve the two-state solution alternative.' Norway took another step against Israel when it supported an arms embargo against Israel at the UN, while most European countries (including Sweden) abstained. Until the mid-'70s, the Norwegian public, along with the country’s political organizations, were clear Israel supporters. Norway transferred two tons of heavy water to Israel for peace purposes, despite it's real use being clear to all. 'We identified with Israel because, like Norway, it was a small country formerly ruled by others, and it had the image of a socialist paradise,' says Waage. The first cracks began appearing following the 1967 Six-Day War with hints of whispers from Palestinian refugees on the streets. Then in July 1973, Mossad assassinated Ahmed Bouchikhi, a Moroccan waiter in Lillehammer, mistaking him for arch-terrorist Hassan Salameh who had participated in the Munich massacre. 'I remember as a child, sitting around the table with my parents’ friends' recalls Waage. 'My parents were devout, Israel-loving, Christians. They were friends with a socialist couple from the radical left who openly supported Palestine before it was acceptable. When they started talking about Israel, they told me and my sister to go to the other room and then we heard yelling. My sister and I looked at each other and asked ‘Who are these crazy people and what’s making them lose their minds?’ When it came to choosing an MA thesis topic, this was my obvious choice.' The real change came in 1978-82. Journalist Odd Karsten Tveit first traveled to the region after The Litani Operation and has since written over a dozen books on the subject. The most recent published last September was a bestseller. 'When I got to the Middle East, there were already thousands of Norwegian soldiers serving as part of UNIFIL forces, he says. 'These aren’t men from the radical left. These are conservatives who signed up for the role 100% supporting Israel. When they finish, almost 100% of them are against Israel.' Why? 'Because they’d been fed a fairytale and it turns out that Israel is the strong, occupying side. They witness IDF operations in Lebanon. Also, thousands of nurses, midwives and doctors volunteered in the West Bank, and they all come back to Norway telling their friends and family what they’ve seen, and the narrative begins to change.' 'Norway had a soft spot for Israel. When Mossad needed Norwegian passports for operations in the Soviet Union, they knew they could talk to someone here but, gradually, it started changing. The First Lebanon War and the invasion of Beirut and [the Christians' massacre] in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, changed the public discourse and opinion and began influencing the politicians. Now we see that Israel is reacting more harshly toward Norway than it is toward Spain and Ireland, who have also unilaterally recognized a Palestinian state. What’s the difference? 'One difference is the emotional connection due to the Oslo Accords. We’re also not in the EU, so it’s easier to attack us.' Tivet is referring to Foreign Minister Katz’s 'retaliatory measures' against Norway: Israel rescinded the diplomatic status of eight Norwegian Embassy personnel working in cooperation with the Palestinian Authority, and Norway consequently closed its office in the West Bank. 'We had, and still have, deep friendly relations with Israel and Israeli citizens, but the extreme and unacceptable steps taken by the current government have proven to us that it is actively disrupting the two-state solution, the only solution for peace,' says Deputy Foreign Minister Kravik. 'Norway isn’t hostile to Israel, it’s a friend. But friends need to be honest and talk about policies they don’t agree with.' Leif Knutsen (63) is a member of Oslo’s Jewish community. Shortly following the October 7 massacre, he started publishing an almost daily newsletter offering an alternative to what the average Norwegian was getting from the country’s mainstream and social media. 'Since Oslo, the Norwegians have become obsessive about Israel. The collapse of the accords means that in politics, academia, the media, or on any platform influencing public opinion, everything about Israel is negative. This has led to the demonization of Israel among the Norwegian public, 50% of whom, when surveyed, responded that Israel is indeed doing to the Palestinians what the Nazis did to the Jews.' Facing a community of 2,000 Jews, we have a quarter of a million Muslims in Oslo alone. This dictates the Norwegian narrative and politics. We also have a sharp increase in crime rate, and as this is statistically connected to certain minority communities here, we also see antagonism toward the Muslim minority and to the Pro-Palestinian demonstrations.' Do you feel antisemitism here? 'We have antisemitism-based violence. People spit and curse and there are places - mainly in the big cities – where you wouldn’t identify as a Jew or as an Israeli. This comes primarily from the Muslims, who do the locals’ legwork for them. Although the locals have been brainwashed with antisemitism, claiming that Israel is conducting genocide and murdering children, they’re horrified when accused of antisemitism, as it’s not part of how they see themselves. During this year’s International Women’s Day march, the organizers initially allowed Jewish women to march with signs protesting rape committed on October 7. When they showed up, however, other demonstrators blocked them shouting 'No Zionists on our streets.' This act crossed the line for the public and the Norwegian prime minister also wrote a letter protesting the incident.' 'Since October 7 and the ensuing war, we’ve witnessed an increase in antisemitism toward Jews in Europe, sadly including Norway,' says Deputy Foreign Minister Kravik. 'The prime minister and foreign minister are in contact with the community and we’ve increased security. The Jews in Norway aren’t responsible for Israel’s policies and we’ll never accept antisemitism. Since October 7, we’ve fiercely condemned the Hamas attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself within international law and have stressed the immediate need to unconditionally release all the hostages.' Knutsen also explains internal factors contributing to the deteriorating discourse regarding, and hostility toward, Israel: 'This government is operating badly and may be on its way to elections next year. Following October 7, a new foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, came in from a humanitarian, rather than diplomatic background. Since assuming his position, he’s been under pressure from his party, demanding he take more drastic and aggressive measures against Israel.' Eide blames Israel alone and has freely accepted Hamas’s versions of events and its casualty figures. His inexperience means he has said things to the media that would ordinarily get diplomats fired. (For example, the Israeli Embassy only learned of Norway’s recognition of Palestine through newspaper headlines). Even before this, the government prevented the King of Norway from conveying his condolences to Israel following the massacre, claiming that this was the government's job, and sent off a particularly lukewarm message of condolence. Norway also refuses to recognize Hamas as a terrorist organization. The message is clear to the Norwegian public: the failing minority government is dependent on two left-wing parties and has dragged Norway to a clear anti-Israel stance, including, in August supporting the issue of arrest warrants for Benny Gantz and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'Here’s another example,' says Knutsen. 'Just before the Passover holiday, the foreign minister ordered the state retailer responsible for the sale of alcohol, to remove all the wines from the West Bank and the Golan from the shelves. So, there wasn’t enough wine for the community. They wouldn’t dare do such a thing to any other minority. But what can we Jews do? Write a letter of complaint? ' 'On the other hand, a survey conducted by The Norwegian Center for Holocaust and Minority Studies,' says John Arne Moen, chairman of Norway’s second largest Jewish community, in Trondheim, 'shows that there’s a much better attitude toward Jews than toward Muslims.' The discrepancy between the government's hostility to Israel and the public’s attitude was also demonstrated by Norway’s public vote in the Eurovision semifinal, awarding Eden Golan a perfect score. But across Oslo and other big cities, we’re seeing horrific exhibitions about the 'genocide' Israel is conducting, including cuffed Gazans being led by Israeli soldiers to their execution, cheerful celebrations of the murder of Israelis at the Allenby Bridge and trampling on Israeli flags on the outskirts of the king’s palace. However, as Israel flexes its muscles to rescind the status of diplomats operating in the West Bank, Norway closed its offices near Ramallah and accused the Israeli government of extremism. Part of this, an Israeli official told us, is about the Norwegian’s arrogant character. 'They can do everything better than everyone else, even bringing about peace. They don’t have the capacity for soul-searching.' Foreign Minister Barth Eide is a contributing factor to the crisis. He has compared Israel to Russia, claimed Israel is conducting war crimes, and has demanded other countries not sell arms to Israel so as not to be accused of war crimes. Norway, alongside Spain, Ireland and France, went back to financing UNRWA and spoke out against other countries who had frozen their UNRWA funding after it was revealed that 12 of its employees had taken part in the October 7 massacre. Eide claimed that 'for 12 rotten apples, you don’t stop funding a whole organization.' A senior Labor Party representative on Norway’s Committee of Foreign Affairs and Defense recommended UNRWA for the Nobel Peace Prize. Leading newspapers reported that 'Israel started a war against Hamas.' The ruling Labor Party youth movement summer camps have been boycotting Israel for years. At the most recent summer camp, the teenagers were photographed in keffiyehs and holding signs accusing Israel of genocide. 'It’s very hard to persuade my students in lectures that Israel’s policies, even the very state, are right,' says Prof. Waage. 'There’s a generation with no sympathy for Israel or knowledge of the Holocaust. I can give long lectures, and then they’ll ask me why I’m against boycotting Israel.' Prof. Waage is Norwegian academia’s good and bad girl. She’s good at her job, and so has more access to material than other scholars. She’s bad as what she finds there, are things the government is trying to conceal. She learned Hebrew a decade ago so as not to depend on her (settler) research assistant as she rummages through the archive in Jerusalem. To her surprise, she found all of the Norwegian government’s secret Oslo documents there. 'The Oslo process actually began in 1979,' she says. 'The Iranian regime fell and the US asked us to supply Israel with oil. Norway went to ask Arafat if that was okay by him, so as not to endanger Norwegian soldiers in Lebanon. He agreed, but asked Norway to mediate between him and the Israelis, as Israel viewed Norway as a friend.' 'We now understand how wrong we were. We were desperately trying to create this jewel for our image and were drunk on our own success. We’ve been telling ourselves this fairytale for 30 years, gracing the salons of, London Brussels and Washington. Until now, it’s been important for us to maintain friendly relations with Israel, but recognizing this failure has given us free rein to criticize Israel. Israel’s reaction, though, is simply insane. All this makes me concerned and really sad.'

Gilat brings joy amid war through interactive theater	The Gilat Foundation uses therapeutic theater to uplift disabled and injured children in hospitals across Israel following year-long fighting The children’s smiles lit up the popular restaurant in Jerusalem, a rare sight after months of multifront war in Israel. These children face daily struggles, whether born with disabilities, injured in attacks, or affected by ongoing conflict. Pitmaster restaurant hosted an event to raise awareness and support for the Gilat Foundation, which uses theater to bring joy to sick children. Founded in 2023 after the October 7 massacre, the Gilat Foundation launched its program in Israel and is now active in four hospitals: Shaare Zedek Medical Center, ALYN Hospital, Shalva National Center, and the Kerem Institute. Around 4,000 children have participated, and four more hospitals, starting with Hadassah after Sukkot, are set to join this year. The Gilat Foundation was established in memory of Gilat Eisenmann, who passed away in 2008 at age 11 after spending much of her life in the hospital. Gilat’s cousin, Shlomi Eisenmann, told The Media Line, 'What’s truly remarkable is that despite those years of sorrow, her parents found the strength to create something positive. They started an organization to help kids just like her.' He explained why therapeutic theater became a central part of the initiative: 'Theater was Gilat’s passion. Even though she was physically impaired, mentally, she was sharp as a knife. She was always aware of everything going on around her. People would visit her, and she’d say, ‘Why are you sad? Be happy. Everything is fine.’ That was her thing. Even in the face of her challenges, she lifted everyone around her.' When the war in Israel began, Shlomi said Gilat’s parents felt compelled to act. 'They rushed to Israel because they realized it was necessary. Many kids were injured or became clinically ill from the attack, and others, already sick, had to be moved to the center of Israel. These children, already in vulnerable situations, had to deal with even more upheaval. It’s tough. That’s why offering them therapeutic theater every week, giving them a space to feel like normal kids, is so vital.' He emphasized the program’s measurable impact: 'One of the heads of education at Alyn Hospital told us that in just two months since the start of the war, she saw an 80% increase in the children’s well-being. That’s a real, measurable result.' Shlomi described the unique power of theater: 'Theater is medicine no doctor can prescribe. You can’t buy it in a supermarket or a pharmacy. We organize everything—bring the kids out of their rooms, even when they don’t feel like moving. Once they come to the show, it changes everything. It’s an hour where they can forget their struggles, and that’s something invaluable.' Tali Eisenmann, president of the foundation and Gilat’s mother, told The Media Line that she had wanted to be a doctor since childhood, which later influenced her decision to become a medic. 'But it didn’t work out. My father said to me, ‘It’s not a study for a religious girl,’ and I was used to listening to him, so I didn’t do it—and I regret it.' 'After Gilat passed away, I still thought maybe I’d be a doctor because I saw how important it is, but I didn’t do it. It was too much; I couldn’t handle it. When we came to Israel, I thought, ‘I want to be a medic.’ So in that, she didn’t really play a role, but what she does play a role in is my approach to people,' Tali shared. 'I’ve learned it’s very important to approach not only the patient but also the people surrounding them because when someone is chronically ill, it’s not only the patient who suffers—it’s the whole family,' she explained. 'I also learned that just because someone is in a wheelchair or disabled, it doesn’t mean they can’t answer, can’t think, or that they’re not normal. You should approach the person directly, even if they have learning difficulties or are mentally disabled—they’re still a person and deserve to be treated like one,' Tali said. Yossi Zecharia is a father of four. His 8-year-old son, Lior, was born with a leg malformation—one leg is shorter than the other. Yossi told The Media Line that Lior has already undergone eight surgeries and will require additional ones nearly every year until he turns 18. The theatrical performances raise Lior’s spirits and give him a moment to forget he has a disability. Lior looks forward to when the actors come to ALYN Hospital to perform. It makes him happy they come to perform, particularly when the children are involved in the play. Mahdi Haruv has worked in ALYN Hospital’s rehabilitation department for five years as a teacher and playroom coordinator. Haruv speaks with passion and pride about the impact of the Gilat Theater on children from all backgrounds. As an Arab Israeli from the Shuafat neighborhood in East Jerusalem, he sees the Gilat program as not only a way to empower patients but also as a place where they learn values and gain a broader understanding of the world. 'The children learn about themselves, get a more positive sense of self, they learn how to be more patient with themselves, with their families, so they can see and be seen in a positive manner. Gilat shows them what they can do in order to be part of society,' Haruv told The Media Line. According to Haruv, many children experience anxiety attacks during their recovery process. Rehabilitation helps them understand their emotions, and the interactive theater program teaches them how to cope with distress and reduce long-term stress. 'Most importantly, theater brings happiness to their faces,' he said. These children are also learning about the world beyond the hospital, with the program teaching them about countries on every continent. The restaurant was packed, and Gilat’s name appeared on large TV screens, placemats, and goody bags. The video playing showed Gilat, a confident young child of 11, who beamed. The joyful atmosphere gave way to the somber reality of war, reflecting the heart-wrenching emotions many have experienced. Zvi Steinfeld, a partner and chef at Pitmaster, is known for captivating guests with his culinary skills. The Gilat videos on screen suddenly turned to Ben Shimoni and Gaya Chalifa, who had worked at the Petach Tikvah branch. Steinfeld told The Media Line that they were at the Nova Festival on October 7. Shimoni managed to escape three times, each time bringing others to safety. On his third escape, he took Chalifa and three others with him. On their way out, they were ambushed by terrorists and killed, Steinfeld shared. 'I worked together with both for nearly two years. We spent many afternoons and nights working side by side. After the services, we would often sit to catch our breaths, discussing anything that evening service to our lives and future plans. They were both incredible young, beautiful people who had a bright future ahead of them that was taken too soon,' Steinfeld said. While the war has heightened stress nationwide and deepened the divide between Israelis and Arabs, Haruv remains hopeful. 'Gilat has taught values and respect to the patients and families who come together during the performances,' says Haruv. 'They are all treated equally, no matter if they are religious or secular, Jew or Arab.' 'At this critical time of war, Gilat gives something important to the state that will help the entire country. It’s an opportunity for peace,' he says. 'If sick kids can play together during war, and then their parents come together, it’s a recipe all can learn from.'

Assad restricts pro-Iran militias in Syria, Strike on Latakia att...	A UK-based Syrian opposition site claims Damascus regime fears being dragged into war, prevents attacks on Israel with the help of Russians At least two people were injured early on Thursday in an overnight strike on the Syrian port of Latakia, which was attributed to Israel. Syrian state media said the attack on the port caused a fire, while other reports claimed the target was a weapons storage facility at the entrance to the port city and that serious damage was caused to homes in the area. Hours earlier, Syrian President Bashar al Assad had imposed restrictions on Iran-backed militias' activities in his country, according to a report in the UK-based Syrian opposition site the Observatory for Human Rights. According to the report, the restrictions were imposed fearing Israeli attacks. The site reported that Assad fears the break-out of war with Israel after previously limiting the scope of their operations along the Syrian-Israeli border on the Golan Heights. It claimed the Damascus regime issued military orders, 'in agreement with the Russians,' to limit Hezbollah and other pro-Iranian militias in villages near Damascus and Homs including the Homs desert that could be used to launch drones at Israel. Unnamed sources quoted in the report claimed the regime was inspecting cars with Lebanese license plates and surveying people arriving from Lebanon, out of concern that Syrian territory would be used to attack Israel. The Observatory said thousands of pro-Iranian militias, including Hezbollah were in Syria and that Israel may take advantage of their presence to strike and to drag Syria into a war it has no interest in. The sources also said that the Syrian military's 4th division, under the command of Assad's brother Maher, issued strict orders not to attack the Golan Heights and 'ignite' conflict with Israel. They said roadblocks were keeping regime forces some 15 kilometers (9 miles) away from the border with Israel and Russian forces were positioned at 17 points along the border to reduce friction while pro-Iranian militia sites were being patrolled by joint Syrian and Russian forces in a number of locations around Syria, to keep an eye on them.

U.S. B-2 stealth bombers strike Yemen in message to Iran	Attack targets Houthi underground weapons stores; 'unique demonstration of the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified' Austin says The United States conducted precision strikes on Wednesday against five underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement. 'This was a unique demonstration of the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified,' Austin said in a statement. 'The employment of US Air Force B-2 Spirit long-range stealth bombers demonstrate U.S. global strike capabilities to take action against these targets when necessary, anytime, anywhere.' According to reports the use of strategic bomber, in the unprecedented attack, was meant to indicate their possible use to strike Iran's nuclear facilities if and when the United States chooses to do so. 'We will continue to make clear to the Houthis that there will be consequences for their illegal and reckless attacks,' he said. Sources told CNN on Thursday that several of the stealth bombers were used in the strike on the Iran-backed Houthis hitting stores of 'advanced weapons' and in response to attacks on US and military vessels as well as commercial ships in the Red Sea. According to the Hezbollah-Affiliated Al Mayadeen network in Lebanon, the UK also participated in the strike on targets near the Yemeni capital of Sanaa and in the northern Saada governorate. A Houthi spokesperson said the attacks were 'a failed attempt to protect Israel,' and to deter the Houthis from supporting Gaza and Lebanon. 'To the Americans and British we say, our abilities are great, and our response will come.' Last month, the IDF attacked the Houthi-controlled Hodeida Port and other strategic targets in Yemen some 1,800 kilometers (1118 miles) away, in response to a Houthis surface-to-surface missile launched at at Tel Aviv. 'The airstrikes focused on key military infrastructure in the Ras Issa and Hodeidah regions, including power stations and a port used for importing oil. These facilities were being used by the Iranian-backed Houthi regime to transfer weapons and military supplies, including oil, to their forces,' the IDF said in a statement.

Focused on his personal needs': New details on alleged Iranian s...	Document details how Vladimir Varkhovsky, suspected of being recruited to kill an Israeli scientist by Tehran, was involved in financial struggles; these are characteristics Iran looks for in an agent A document compiled on Vladimir Varkhovsky, who was charged with a series of security offenses on behalf of Iranian intelligence and agreed to assassinate an Israeli scientist for $100,000, had previously sought 'quick and easy financial solutions without exercising judgment,' Ynet learned on Wednesday. The document came following his involvement in a credit card fraud case. Varkhovsky made aliyah to Israel from Ukraine eight years ago and worked as a security guard in a building and was unarmed. 'At the time of the offense, he was focused on his personal and immediate needs, exercising short-term judgment,' the document from 2017 read detailing the man’s entanglement following financial difficulties shortly after his arrival in Israel. 'His behavior indicates problematic patterns of conduct and coping.' He was ultimately convicted in the case and served community service. 'They [Iranians] usually tend to recruit people with limited means. Not necessarily of foreign origin, but those born and raised here have more nationalism, making it harder to recruit them to act against their own country. People who recently moved here — have less national affiliation on the face of it, making them targets or at least a starting point,' said M., who previously worked at the Defense Ministry. However, he also pointed to 'vulnerabilities' among native Israelis: 'Lower socio-economic status, urgency to pay a criminal body or a criminal record — because they've already broken the law before.' 'For young people, like the couple from Ramat Gan who don't have children, there's less to lose,' he added. 'Their families aren't in the country, and it's harder to reach them. Unfortunately, many young people spend a lot of time on social media without realizing what they're getting into.' 'You can't easily send them to buy weapons, but rather to film locations and spread malice — it's important for parents to monitor what their kids are doing online,' he explained. Dvir Kariv, who served in the Shin Bet for 22 years, said, 'The idea is to harm Israel from afar —using innocent people in exchange for money. They (the Iranians) will approach people with a criminal past, those who have already broken the law, or innocent, desperate individuals. The guy from Petah Tikva agreed to kill a scientist after a series of bad turns.' 'There are people who wanted to be like James Bond and join intelligence agencies but ended up as security guards. They get drawn into becoming enticing agents from abroad, which gives them a taste for life. You get money, dabble in intelligence and life seems like a Hollywood movie — until you find yourself in an abyss at some point,' he added. Iranian recruitment efforts are conducted via through various ads — some on Facebook — or offers for translation services in different languages, with payments of thousands of shekels per page. This is how the Iranians try to lure numerous residents. 'The Iranians want to retaliate quickly for what we've done to them. Many of us 'live' on social media since the COVID-19 pandemic and technological development. Iranian agents operate on two levels — either personal or broad approaches. If it seems too good to be true, it isn't,' Kariv said. 'They filter out unsuspecting people who think they can make easy money from home. These innocent people enter their details and that’s where the fall begins.' Varkhovsky’s espionage case wasn’t the only one uncovered this week. Vladislav Victorsson, 30 and Anna Bernstein, 18 who were recruited by an Iranian intelligence operative on Telegram, were initially asked to spray graffiti, then to distribute flyers and later set cars on fire — with the ultimate goal being to assassinate a high-ranking Israeli official. Varkhovsky was similarly asked to spray graffiti, plant tracking devices and finally, collect a gun. 'It escalates and deteriorates,' Kariv said. 'At some point, they ask for a picture while carrying out the mission and only pay after they receive it. This serves as leverage.' Adi Carmi, who served in the Shin Bet for 28 years, explained, 'Moti Maman — an Ashdod businessman — who was caught after being in Iran, has a completely different profile from those caught this week, who supposedly had no ties to the state.' 'He was recruited because businessmen operating outside the country's borders have more face-to-face access and the ability to exploit them is more present. When you post a random, intriguing ad on Facebook, thousands respond and a few remain who don't realize what they're getting into. It's like a honey trap — they start getting entangled and then they begin to fear being blackmailed,' he added. In a typical year, the Shin Bet foils around 500 attempts of severe attacks within Israel's borders. Since the war in Gaza began, 1,200 attacks have been thwarted according to the intelligence agency. Most civilians targeted were identified by agencies before the attacks, but concerns still exist that not all can be stopped in time. 'The working assumption is that you don't expose them all — because the more complex recruitments worry the Shin Bet as they're conducted more slowly and cleverly. The technological foundation is much deeper and more intricate,' Kariv explained.
