Netanyahu rejects last-minute Hamas demands in hostage negotiatio...	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a conference call with the Israeli negotiation team in Doha, during which he was briefed on Hamas' last-minute attempts to reverse the agreements reached on May 27. According to Netanyahu's office, Hamas is now demanding the right to dictate the identity of high-profile prisoners set for release, contrary to a clause granting Israel veto power over individuals considered symbols of terrorism. Netanyahu instructed the team to stand firm on the agreed terms and reject what he called 'Hamas’ last-minute extortion attempts.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk6bizip1g	2025-01-15T20:18:39-08:00

Technical details' remain, list of prisoners not finalized: Desp...	Although a final agreement has already been reached, there are still details that have not yet been finalized; The cabinet will convene only after the negotiating team gives final approval and if all goes well the cease-fire will go into effect on Sunday at 12:15 p.m. - and 3 hostages will be returned to Israel Technical details in the agreement on the hostage release deal that is expected to come into effect in the coming days are still unresolved. The Israeli negotiation team, headed by Mossad Chief David Barnea, will remain in Qatar overnight Wednesday to conclude the details on the deal's implementation, including the final list of Palestinian terrorists who will be freed. More than a year after the previous hostage deal collapsed, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed al-Thani convened a press conference Wednesday night, in which he officially announced that Israel and Hamas had reached an agreement under which the cease-fire will begin on Sunday at 12:15 p.m. Only after all the details have been finalized will the head of the National Security Council, Tzachi Hanegbi, summon the members of the Security Cabinet to approve the deal, and a full government meeting is expected to follow. The negotiating team will likely participate remotely from Qatar. Although both the far-right Religious Zionist and Otzma Yehudit parties have said they would oppose the deal, it is expected to be approved in the government by a large majority. The final names of the terrorists to be freed will be released by the government secretariat on Thursday to allow opponents to appeal to the Supreme Court. If everything goes as planned, there is an expectation that the implementation of the deal will begin next week but the schedule is dependent on the ability of Hamas to carry out the release of hostages. According to the details of the deal, a six-week cease-fire will come into effect, during which the IDF will gradually withdraw from the central Gaza Strip, and displaced Palestinians will be allowed to return to the north. During this period, Israel will release 30 terrorists in exchange for each kidnapped civilian, and 50 terrorists for each female soldier released. The women will initially be released in two rounds, on the first day of the cease-fire, three women will be released, and on the seventh day four women will be released. Israel agreed with Hamas that the living hostages will be released first and only then the dead, out of a desire to release the living hostages as quickly as possible. So far, Hamas has not provided Israel with the list of the living hostages, and is supposed to provide this list on the seventh day of the cease-fire. After the women and the two Bibas children are released, adults over the age of 50 are expected to be released, followed by the wounded men, including Yarden Bibas, the father of Kfir and Ariel. Only at the end of the process will the dead hostages be returned to Israel. For the older hostages, Palestinian prisoners will be released at a ratio of 3:1 serving a life sentence, and another 27 prisoners for each sentenced to different terms. In addition, 50 wounded Hamas members will be allowed to cross daily through the Rafah crossing into Egypt with escorts, and each of them will be required to obtain permission from Israel and Egypt. Wounded civilians also will be allowed to leave. In the sixth week of the cease-fire, Hamas is scheduled to release long-held hostages Hisham al-Sayed and Abra Mengistu – who will be released under the category of the sick and wounded – and Israel will release 47 prisoners from the Shalit deal in exchange for their release. In total, 210 Palestinian minors and women will be released for five civilian hostages and the two Bibas children; 150 prisoners serving life sentences and 100 additional prisoners will be released for the five abducted female soldiers; 110 serving life sentences and 100 additional prisoners will be released for the nine sick and wounded hostages; 30 serving life sentences and 270 additional prisoners will be released for the 10 adult hostages; 60 prisoners and 47 released in the Shalit deal who were re-imprisoned will be released for Mengistu and al-Sayed; and 1,000 Palestinians who were detained since October 8 and did not participate in the massacre will be released. A total of 290 life prisoners and 1,687 other prisoners and detainees will be released, but the final number depends on how many hostages return alive. Initially, Israel resisted releasing prisoners in exchange for dead bodies, but ultimately compromised on a limited release. The murderous terrorists will not be released to the West Bank but will be deported to a third country of their choice – Qatar, Turkey, Algeria or another country. Prisoners who do not have blood on their hands will be able to return to their homes in the West Bank. In addition, Israel is also preparing to return the bodies of Palestinian terrorists to Gaza. During the first 42 days of the cease-fire, Israel will maintain a 700-meter security zone in the Gaza Strip, and will control the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors - but there will also be a gradual withdrawal of the IDF from the rest of Gaza areas. As part of the agreement, Gaza residents will be able to return to the northern Gaza Strip, but they will not be allowed to return armed or bring in weapons. The deal includes security arrangements regarding a mechanism that will inspect vehicles and freight wagons on the Netzarim Corridor, which crosses the Strip at its width. According to the plan, an American company will carry out the inspection. On the seventh day, displaced persons will be allowed to return to the northern Gaza Strip, without weapons and without being searched. In addition, vehicles will be allowed to pass north, which will be inspected by a private company. As part of the agreement, there will be a significant increase in the amount of humanitarian aid that will be brought into Gaza, to about 600 trucks per day. Israel also agreed to stop intelligence gathering in Gaza during the days of the release of the hostages. Negotiations on the second phase will begin by the 16th day of the first phase, during which all remaining live hostages, including the soldiers, are expected to be released - at which time a permanent cease-fire also will come into effect and there will be a full withdrawal of IDF forces. In the third phase, all dead hostages will be returned and, according to the agreement, the rehabilitation and rebuilding of the Strip will begin under the supervision of Egypt, Qatar and the UN. The handshakes between the parties were delayed until the last minute, and even after the announcement that a deal had been reached, the Prime Minister's Office rushed to issue a clarification statement stating that 'in light of Prime Minister Netanyahu's firm stance, Hamas backed down on its demand at the last minute to change the deployment of forces on the Philadelphi Corridor. However, there are still 'a number of clauses in the hostage-ceasefire deal that have yet to be finally agreed upon,' and that 'the details will be finalized tonight.' Prime Minister's spokesman Omer Dostri also noted that 'the reports of a 'withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor' are a complete lie. Prime Minister Netanyahu has not given up a millimeter of Israeli control over the Philadelphi Corridor.' However, according to the disclosed agreement, Israel will gradually reduce its forces on the Philadelphi Corridor during the first phase of the deal - and will complete the withdrawal no later than the 50th day. 'Israel made it difficult, Hamas was the main obstacle' After an agreement was reached on the details of the hostage deal, U.S. President Joe Biden, who had been involved in the negotiations for the past year, also officially announced that Israel and Hamas had reached an agreement. Other senior American officials who were partners in the efforts also gave briefings and congratulated the sides on reaching the long-awaited goal. A senior White House official involved in the talks shared behind-the-scenes details. 'On May 27, President Biden presented the plan that led to a cease-fire in Gaza and the release in the first phase of women, children, the elderly, the wounded and the sick among the hostages.' In fact, the deal approved Wednesday night is similar to the one Biden presented last summer. 'We had intensive talks about this deal that was approved a few months ago,' the official said, 'but the talks stalled on August 31, when Hirsh Goldberg-Polin and five other hostages were killed in the tunnel in Rafah.' According to the official, after the murder of the six hostages , the Americans changed their strategy and focused on the northern border in order to 'push out' Hezbollah. 'Since October, we have been holding talks with Prime Minister Netanyahu and his national security team regarding the effects of the situation in Lebanon on the deal to release the hostages,' the senior official said. 'During an important visit on November 27, we reached a cease-fire agreement in Lebanon, which led to more intensive engagement in the arrangement for the release of the hostages in Gaza.' 'On December 12, during a visit to Israel, we discussed for hours the acceleration of efforts,' the official added. 'The changes in the region, including the isolation of Hamas, helped to move forward. By the end of December, Hamas agreed to provide a list of 33 hostages for release, which allowed for progress. From January 5 until today, we have been working on the final details, including cease-fire agreements, force deployment, Hamas conditions, humanitarian aid and lists of Palestinian prisoners to be released.' Steve Witkoff, President-elect Donald Trump's designated Middle East envoy, who arrived in Israel on a surprise visit on Saturday, helped finalize the final details, the official said. 'For an entire night until 3 a.m., the negotiating teams, the Americans, the Israelis, the Qataris and the Egyptians, were coordinating to ensure that the agreement could be completed Wednesday.' U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller hinted at another briefing for reporters that the move to the second phase of the agreement is not certain. 'To get from the first phase to the second phase, Egypt and Qatar need to push Hamas, and the U.S. needs to push Israel - these are promises that we cannot keep in the five days remaining until the new administration,' Miller said. 'Therefore,' Miller explained, 'it is critical that all parties involved see that the United States is in the room and that when it makes promises, these are long-term promises. The involvement of President-elect Donald Trump's team in the negotiations was necessary to reach a signing. This was an unusual conduct and we greatly appreciate the team's involvement.' Miller also shared the difficulties that preceded reaching an agreement. 'There were times when we came to the Israeli government and said, 'You're pushing too hard and we're asking you to back off,'' he said. A day after National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir admitted that Israel had torpedoed deals, Miller said that 'there were times when Israel presented new conditions and new proposals that made it difficult to reach an agreement - just like Hamas did.' 'That's the nature of negotiations,' he said. 'But in the last five, six months, it was Hamas that wasn't willing to negotiate - and for a period, after Sinwar's elimination , it couldn't either. We thought we were very close to a deal in July-August, but then we saw that Hamas simply wouldn't budge. Israel was willing to discuss and Hamas wasn't. Hamas was undoubtedly the main obstacle, especially since August.' UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who has frequently criticized Israel since the outbreak of the war, also welcomed the declaration of the cease-fire. 'I commend the mediators – Egypt, Qatar and the United States – for their dedicated efforts in formulating the agreement,' he said Wednesday evening. 'Their uncompromising commitment to finding a diplomatic solution was critical to this achievement. I call on all parties to uphold their commitments and ensure that the agreement is fully implemented.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In his official statement, the UN Secretary-General focused on 'alleviating the immense suffering' caused to the Palestinians. 'It is essential that the cease-fire removes the significant security and political obstacles that prevent the delivery of aid throughout Gaza, so that we can significantly increase the urgent humanitarian support that saves lives. The humanitarian situation is at catastrophic levels,' he said. 'This agreement is a critical first step, but we must also harness all efforts to advance broader goals, including preserving the unity, contiguity and integrity of the occupied Palestinian territory,' Guterres said. 'I urge the parties and all relevant partners to seize this opportunity to establish a credible political path for a better future for Palestinians, Israelis and the region.' He said: 'Ending the occupation and achieving an agreed-upon two-state solution, in which Israel and Palestine live side-by-side in peace and security, in accordance with international law, relevant UN resolutions and previous agreements, remains an urgent priority. Only through a viable two-state solution can the aspirations of both peoples be realized.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjtnb2bvyx	2025-01-15T14:27:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/16/r1mYWTBD1x/r1mYWTBD1x_0_0_850_1773_0_small.jpg

Prime Minister's Office puts out statement describing the warm thanks the prime minister expressed to the incoming American president in phone call; Netanyahu also spoke with and thanked Biden Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on Wednesday with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and with President Joe Biden. In a statement released by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) on Wednesday night, Netanyahu was said to lavish Trump with compliments. According to the statement, Netanyahu 'thanked the president-elect for his assistance in advancing the release of hostages and for helping Israel bring an end to the suffering of dozens of hostages and their families.' The statement said that Netanyahu is committed to returning all of the hostages 'however he can, and commended the U.S. President-elect for his remarks that the U.S. would work with Israel to ensure that Gaza will never be a haven for terrorism.' The statement went on to say that the two men agreed to meet in Washington soon, and ended by saying that Netanyahu also spoke with and thanked Biden for his help in advancing the deal. Earlier Trump celebrated the agreement in a post on his Truth Social platform. 'We have a deal for the hostages in the Middle East. They will be released shortly. Thank you.' He said he was pleased that the hostages would soon be returning home. 'With this deal in place, my National Security team, through the efforts of Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will continue to work closely with Israel and our Allies to make sure Gaza NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven. We will continue promoting PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH throughout the region, as we build upon the momentum of this cease-fire to further expand the Historic Abraham Accords. This is only the beginning of great things to come for America, and indeed, the World!' Biden also expressed his pleasure at the agreement reached in Qatar in an announcement from the White House. 'I laid out the precise contours of this plan on May 31, 2024, after which it was endorsed unanimously by the UN Security Council. It is the result not only of the extreme pressure that Hamas has been under and the changed regional equation after a ceasefire in Lebanon and weakening of Iran — but also of dogged and painstaking American diplomacy. My diplomacy never ceased in their efforts to get this done,' he said.

Amnesty International Venice event to present Gaza 'genocide' rep...	The event’s use of the term 'genocide' drew backlash from Venice’s Jewish community, leading to venue changes and rising tensions Venice has become the center of a heated debate following Amnesty International’s recent event aimed at presenting its findings on alleged genocide in Gaza. The controversy erupted over the event’s original title, 'You Feel Like You Are Subhuman: The Genocide of Israel Against the Palestinian People in Gaza,' which some deemed inflammatory. This sparked venue changes and a broader discussion on freedom of expression versus cultural sensitivity. Amnesty International had planned the event for January 9, 2025, at the Venetian Athenaeum to present its report on the situation in Gaza over the past 15 months. However, the use of the term 'genocide' provoked immediate backlash from the local Jewish community, which argued that it was provocative and trivialized their historical experiences. 'This whole situation reminded me of Germany in 1933. We live in an historical moment in which hatred toward Jews is growing stronger than ever. Not only did Jews face the Shoah [Holocaust] in the past, but worldwide they are still contested,' explained Paolo Navarro Dina, vice president of the Jewish Community of Venice. 'The flyer Amnesty distributed mentioned the word ‘genocide,’ which trivializes our history. So, as the Jewish community, we asked the Venetian Athenaeum to opt for a different term, without opposing the event per se,' he added. For Amnesty, however, the title reflected the gravity of its findings. After nine months of investigation, we concluded that Israel committed three acts of genocide, as defined by the 1948 Convention 'After nine months of investigation, we concluded that Israel committed three acts of genocide, as defined by the 1948 Convention,' said Riccardo Noury, spokesperson for Amnesty Italy. 'This was not a term we used lightly,' he added. The Venetian Athenaeum ultimately withdrew its support for the event, citing concerns over 'public order.' 'We criticized the mention of genocide, but we had no intention of censoring or canceling the event. This was the Athenaeum’s decision, not ours, but the way it was handled suggested otherwise,' Navarro Dina explained. The event was later moved to the University of Ca’ Foscari on the same date, drawing a crowd of about 500 people. However, it was presented under a different title: 'Presentation and Discussion of the Report of Amnesty International Regarding the Israeli Military Campaign in Gaza' – suggesting the university’s intention to use more neutral language. We criticized the mention of genocide, but we had no intention of censoring or canceling the event 'Without us knowing, the title was changed, but we still achieved our goal of sharing our findings with a larger audience than expected, despite the controversy that initially aimed to prevent the event by shifting the focus from this genocide to antisemitism,' Noury explained. 'It is not a matter of measuring the number of victims; it is about recognizing that a state has committed acts prohibited by international law. It is our job to report it, just as we have in other international cases, such as Rwanda, Bosnia, Cambodia, and the Yazidis,' he added. Amnesty rejected accusations that its report incited hatred or antisemitism. 'Antisemitism is a violation of human rights. It is unacceptable to accuse an organization like ours, which defends human rights, of being antisemitic,' countered Noury. Following the controversy, the Jewish community reported receiving hate mail and threats, escalating tensions. 'We are facing hate unfairly and have received several letters. These people are not even anonymous—they write their full names – so we are still checking who they are,' Navarro Dina said. Messages ranged from accusations of political manipulation to more serious threats. 'Some letters accused us of controlling political and economic power to silence counter-narratives, while others contained statements like, ‘You will end up in hell and be finally condemned,’' Navarro Dina revealed. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The overall atmosphere is heavy; we just witnessed the recent events in Bologna. I want to remind everyone that, most of the time, hatred towards Israel hides a far uglier facade,' Navarro Dina concluded. There’s an epidemic of anger and division today, for sure, and we condemn any form of hate towards anyone Amnesty distanced itself from these incidents and stressed that addressing uncomfortable truths is essential to protecting human rights. 'There’s an epidemic of anger and division today, for sure, and we condemn any form of hate towards anyone. But equating our work with antisemitism undermines our pursuit of justice,' Noury concluded.

Trump administration plans ICC sanctions over arrest warrants for...	Trump administration is preparing sanctions against ICC officials following arrest warrants for prime minister and former defense minister; Measures include freezing assets and travel bans, aiming to pressure the court to withdraw the warrants and halt proceedings Israel and the United States are coordinating an extensive sanctions plan targeting judges and officials of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in response to the issuance of arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Sanctions are set to take effect on January 20, President-elect Donald Trump's first day back in office. The U.S. is reportedly preparing severe measures against ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan, as well as judges and staff involved in the case. These include entry bans to the United States and the freezing of bank accounts, which would also hinder their ability to use credit cards in Europe. According to a senior Israeli official, these actions resemble sanctions previously imposed on violent West Bank settlers, which effectively barred them from using credit cards in Israeli banks due to fears of repercussions from the U.S. Treasury. In a second phase, additional sanctions are being pushed forward by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. These measures would prohibit the transfer of U.S. aid to countries that announce they will honor the ICC arrest warrants. While these sanctions are unlikely to affect Western European nations, they could have significant consequences for countries reliant on U.S. assistance. The overarching goal of the sanctions plan is to exert unprecedented pressure on the ICC and force it to withdraw the arrest warrants. Israel has already filed an appeal with the court, which it hopes will provide the ICC with a face-saving exit. 'We will bring the court to its knees and then negotiate the closure of the case,' a senior Israeli source said. 'Our appeal will give them a way to climb down from the tree top they ventured to.' In parallel, Israel is pursuing diplomatic efforts to convince the United Nations Security Council to request a suspension of the arrest warrants, citing broader political interests and the promotion of peace. Senior Israeli officials claim Khan acted improperly in issuing the ICC arrest warrants, alleging the decision was influenced by personal allegations of sexual harassment against him. According to these officials, Khan issued the warrants two days before a planned visit to Israel in an effort to deflect attention from the accusations. Background on the ICC arrest warrants In November, the ICC rejected appeals submitted by Israel and issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. The court also issued an arrest warrant for Mohammed Deif, the Hamas military commander who has reportedly already been killed, a claim that remains unconfirmed by Hamas. The court accuses Netanyahu and Gallant of criminal responsibility for the following offenses: As co-perpetrators of the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare. Crimes against humanity, including murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts. As civilian superiors, for the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against civilian populations. Foreign minister responds Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar addressed the arrest warrants during a diplomatic visit to Italy, emphasizing Israel is not a signatory to the Rome Statute and is therefore not under the jurisdiction of the ICC. Sa’ar described the court’s actions as violating fundamental legal principles of jurisdiction and complementarity, accusing the ICC of undermining Israel's right to self-defense. > During his meetings, Sa’ar highlighted the recent appointment of Nawaf Salam, the former president of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), as Lebanon’s prime minister. Sa’ar noted Salam had previously referred to Israel as an 'enemy' and had presided over a case brought against Israel by South Africa alleging genocide. 'What kind of justice can Israel expect from these judicial bodies under such circumstances?' Sa’ar asked. 'Israel is committed to international law, but this is a mockery and politicization of international judicial institutions.' Italy's foreign minister and justice minister assured Sa’ar that the Italian government has received legal advice confirming immunity for Israeli leaders, including Netanyahu, during visits to Italy. They further explained that their position on immunity is grounded in the Vienna Convention. This situation underscores the intensifying geopolitical tensions between Israel, the United States and international judicial institutions, as well as the broader implications for global diplomatic and legal norms. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1qsnwhd1e	2025-01-15T12:23:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/29/rJDFwVPXJx/rJDFwVPXJx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Gazans celebrate cease-fire deal, Hamas terrorists join crowd	We are here and will remain here,' armed Hamas member says; 'We will rebuild and Gaza will be more beautiful than ever,' says one resident of the Strip Gazans on Wednesday evening celebrated the news that a cease-fire agreement has been struck that will not only bring about the release of hostages but an end to the fighting that they hope will be permanent and bring an end to the war after much of the Gaza Strip has been destroyed and most of its residents displaced. The first phase of the deal will see an increase in humanitarian aid and the return of many from the northern areas of the Strip to their homes. Hamas claimed victory in a statement and said the cease-fire deal is 'a turning point in the struggle on the way to the ultimate goal of liberation.' Some of the Hamas supporters chanted 'We are Mohammed Deif's people,' referring to the slain head of the Hamas military wing, killed in an Israeli strike last August. In Khan Younis, Hamas terrorists joined the celebrations with their guns raised. 'We are around and will remain around,' one said. Others raised the Palestinian flag and one woman vowed that Gaza would be rebuilt. 'It will be more beautiful than ever, we will rebuild and rehabilitate. That is our achievement,' she said. Hamas's communications office came out with a statement calling on people to avoid trouble until the cease-fire is in effect, perhaps hoping to avoid a mass return of displaced residents to the north where many of their homes were destroyed.

Biden announces deal from White House: 'My diplomacy never ceased...	Outgoing president says that 'this deal would have to be implemented by the next team,' referring to the Trump administration; 'I told my team to coordinate closely with the incoming team to make sure we're all speaking with the same voice because that's what American presidents do' U.S. President Joe Biden announced on Wednesday from the White House that Israel and Hamas e reached a cease-fire and hostage deal that will end the fighting in Gaza and 'surge humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians.' 'I can announce a cease-fire and a hostage deal has been reached between Israel and Hamas,' Biden said at the White House. The deal was reached after 15 months of suffering, he said, and will be followed by a surge of humanitarian aid in Gaza. 'Fighting in Gaza will stop, and soon the hostages return home to their families,' Biden said. 'I laid out the precise contours of this plan on May 31, 2024, after which it was endorsed unanimously by the UN Security Council. It is the result not only of the extreme pressure that Hamas has been under and the changed regional equation after a ceasefire in Lebanon and weakening of Iran — but also of dogged and painstaking American diplomacy. My diplomacy never ceased in their efforts to get this done,' he said. 'Even as we welcome this news, we remember all the families whose loved ones were killed in Hamas’s October 7th attack, and the many innocent people killed in the war that followed. It is long past time for the fighting to end and the work of building peace and security to begin,' Biden also said. > When asked how much credit Trump's team should get for this deal, given Trump has already claimed credit, Biden said 'This is the exact framework of the deal I proposed back in May. Exact. And, we got the world to endorse it.' In a nod to and a dig at the incoming Trump administration, Biden said: 'This deal would have to be implemented by the next team. So, I told my team to coordinate closely with the incoming team to make sure we're all speaking with the same voice because that's what American presidents do.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skfuhthwkx	2025-01-15T10:39:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/08/ry1csPX4kl/ry1csPX4kl_0_170_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

33 hostages released in 6 weeks, women and children first: These ...	At least 3 hostages will be released each week during the 42-day cease-fire as the IDF gradually withdraws from central Gaza and displaced persons return to the north; For each kidnapped civilian, 30 terrorists will be released, and for each female soldier 50; Negotiations on the second phase of the deal will begin by the 16th day After long and arduous negotiations, an agreement was reached between Israel and Hamas Wednesday evening on a deal in which 33 hostages, both living and dead, will be returned to Israel from Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip. The list of hostages to be released includes all women still in captivity, civilians and soldiers, all children (Ariel and Kfir Bibas) and all men over the age of 50 who are still in captivity. These are the details of the deal that are known so far: As part of the agreement, a six-week cease-fire will come into effect, during which the IDF will gradually withdraw from the central Gaza Strip, and displaced Palestinians will be allowed to return to the north. During this period, Israel will release 30 terrorists in exchange for each kidnapped civilian, and 50 terrorists for each female soldier released. First, the women and children will be released, followed by men over the age of 50. The release of those kidnapped by Hamas will be spread out over 42 days, six weeks, with at least three hostages being released each week. As part of the agreement, by the end of the first phase, Israel will release from prison all female terrorists held since October 7, 2023, as well as male terrorists under the age of 19 who were arrested since the outbreak of the war. In total, between 990 and 1,650 terrorists are expected to be released, with the final number depending on the number of live hostages who return as part of the deal. Negotiations on the second phase of the agreement, guaranteed by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, will begin by the 16th day of the first phase. The second phase is expected to include the release of all remaining hostages, including soldiers, and to ensure a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and a full IDF withdrawal from it. The third phase is expected to include the return of all remaining hostages and the beginning of the reconstruction of Gaza under the supervision of Egypt, Qatar and the UN. After final handshakes and after the last-minute crises were resolved , an Israeli and an American senior official announced Wednesday evening: 'The crisis has been resolved - there is an agreement.' The Egyptian channel Al-Qahera Al-Ekhbariya also reported that an agreement had been reached 'following the efforts of the mediators, after hours of hard work.' In order to approve the deal, the political-security cabinet will convene Thursday morning at 11:00, and immediately afterward a government meeting will be held, at the end of which the list of prisoners who will be released as part of the agreement will be published. The IDF is preparing to return the hostages, and the name given to the operation is 'Wings of Freedom.' Approval of the deal requires a simple majority so, despite the opposition of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who maintains a certain ambiguity, and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, it is expected to be approved. In light of the developments, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar cut short his state visit to Italy and is returning to Israel. After the agreement is approved, the public will be given time to petition the High Court of Justice against the deal and the list of terrorists who are expected to be released. The Israeli negotiating delegation, led by Mossad head Dedi Barnea, is expected to remain in Doha Wednesday night to complete the talks on implementing the agreement, and to finalize the list of prisoners who will be released as part of the deal, including terrorist murderers. Now, a series of technical details remain to be finalized, and only upon the delegation's return to Israel will it be possible to convene the cabinet, so that a postponement during the government meeting is possible. Although, according to various reports and according to the details of the agreement that have been revealed, there will be a complete withdrawal of IDF forces from the Gaza Strip, the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement that: 'In light of Prime Minister Netanyahu's firm stance, Hamas backed down on its demand at the last minute to change the deployment of forces on the Philadelphi Corridor. However, there are still a number of clauses in the hostage-ceasefire deal that have yet to be finally agreed upon,' and 'the details will be finalized tonight.' > The prime minister's spokesman, Omer Dostri, also noted that 'the reports of a 'withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor' are a complete lie. Prime Minister Netanyahu has not given up a millimeter of Israeli control over the Philadelphi Corridor.' US President-elect Donald Trump, who said in recent weeks that if a deal is not reached before his inauguration 'there will be all hell to pay,' was quick to offer his congratulates on the agreement. 'We have a deal for the hostages in the Middle East. They will be released shortly. Thank you,' he posted on his Truth Social platform. Trump then published another post, in which he promised to work together with Israel and U.S. allies to ensure that Gaza 'never becomes a safe haven for terrorism.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hymymfsvyl	2025-01-15T10:08:13-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/14/Sy00vM6END1x/Sy00vM6END1x_0_227_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

We must declare a state of mental health emergency for Israel’s ...	Mati Kochavi has touched hearts worldwide with Eva.Stories, conducted business in the Gulf long before the Abraham Accords, connected with key Middle Eastern leaders and became a billionaire; now he tackles Israel’s child mental health crisis and his AI-based pediatric care project aims to deliver early intervention, blending technology with human therapists for critical support What does care for children with developmental challenges have to do with enhancing sports broadcasts, protecting oil facilities in Gulf countries, a media project to commemorate the Holocaust, reducing anxiety in adults and creating smart cities? At first glance, there’s no connection. But for Mati Kochavi, it all boils down to one thing: information. More precisely, collecting, analyzing, understanding, presenting and using data that constantly flows from the Internet, social media, satellites and sensors. His goal is to turn information into knowledge. And with knowledge—processed through powerful artificial intelligence tools—you can more or less do whatever you like; protect, inspire or heal. Today, Kochavi’s focus is on integrating AI into pediatric medical care, but he says his ultimate aim is nothing less than revolutionizing the world. 'I’m fighting for the future of humanity,' he tells me. Subtlety is not his style. If the name Mati Kochavi, 62, sounds familiar, but you can’t quite place it, you likely last encountered him in 2019. That’s when the Israeli entrepreneur and billionaire captivated public attention with Eva.Stories. Created and produced with his daughter, Maya, the project chronicled the life of Eva Heyman, a 13-year-old girl murdered in the Holocaust, through a series of 70 Instagram Stories based on her diary. Three years later, Kochavi—splitting his time between New York for work and his home in Caesarea—teamed up with his daughter once again to create The Story of Equiano, the true account of an African boy abducted into slavery, this time told through TikTok. Both projects combined have reached over half a billion views and won numerous awards. Kochavi was inspired to create Eva.Stories after encountering data collected online that highlighted a lack of interest—and presumably knowledge—about the Holocaust among young people. 'What’s happening today, with the rise of antisemitism among the younger generation, doesn’t surprise me,' he says. 'We already saw it back then, but no one cared.' Despite living in the United States for more than 30 years, Kochavi still deeply cares. He considers himself fully Israeli. 'I’m Israeli, my children and grandchildren are Israeli, my home is in Caesarea, my language is Hebrew. I travel the world because my life is global. I don’t employ people in Israel, but I’ve been active and involved in dozens of different social initiatives over the years, especially now, when the country and its society are in the eye of the storm.' One of these initiatives is his dream to build the best kindergarten in Israel for the children of Kibbutz Nir Oz when they return home. 'That’s my dream,' Kochavi says. What’s your take on what the country is going through? 'When there’s so much chaos, conflict and instability, it’s obvious things aren’t working well. It’s poorly managed. Israeli politics is violent; dramatic decisions are made by a razor-thin margin—it’s political bullying. We’ve lost our sense of empathy. This didn’t just happen over the past year. It’s a process. The social contract in Israel is eroding.' You live in Caesarea, not far from the prime minister. You’ve seen the protests. 'We must not erode democracy in Israel—it will lead to dramatic harm to the Israeli economy. There are processes at play that are hard not to notice: a decline in democracy, rising corruption, bad things are taking place. A corrupt country with deep inequalities cannot succeed. No chance. Every investor and every businessperson working with or in Israel needs to know that its institutions—courts, banks, the central bank, the state comptroller and others—are independent and strong. This year, the Nobel Prize in economics was awarded to a researcher who demonstrated the direct link between economic growth and the independence and strength of institutions. Investors go where there’s intellect, innovation and solutions, and these require a democratic environment to thrive. One of the biggest problems we face today is the severe damage done to our democracy.' 'Citizens from all social strata and every part of the country must demand a new social order,' says Kochavi, 'one that prioritizes their economic and personal well-being. The public deserves excellent education systems, compassionate healthcare, a fair tax system, a just judiciary and law enforcement that does not compromise in the face of violence. Israeli politics must offer the public an optimistic vision. As of now, that’s not happening.' 'Close and personal relationships with key Middle Eastern Arab leaders' Despite his many ventures in media and gaming, Kochavi hasn’t abandoned his core field: using information for defense and security purposes. He was among the first Israelis to do business with the United Arab Emirates, and reportedly with Saudi Arabia as well, during 2006–2014—long before the Abraham Accords. His work included securing oil facilities and other sensitive sites, signing contracts to convert planes into reconnaissance aircraft in Greece and installing an array of cameras and sensors across Dubai, turning it into a smart city—one that is especially recorded and monitored. In a small and ironic twist of history, the system Kochavi, an Israeli, installed ended up helping Dubai’s police identify Mossad agents who assassinated the terrorist Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in early 2010. Security cameras captured members of the hit squad renting a room, walking around in tennis gear and more, leading to a diplomatic crisis between Israel, the UK, Australia and the UAE. On top of this, Kochavi employed numerous generals and high-ranking security officials in his defense companies, reportedly paying them handsomely. This drew attention from Israeli media and even criticism from a few anti-Israel websites, which labeled him a spy. He even has an entry on the whistleblower site WikiSpooks. So, what’s the story here? 'I can’t go into much detail because everything is highly sensitive, but every deal had to be approved by the Israeli defense establishment,' says Kochavi. 'I wasn’t involved in cyber operations—everything was about information, sensors and innovative ways to perceive reality in order to protect critical infrastructure. All the projects in the Gulf revolved around these areas.' He clarifies that he didn’t do business in Qatar. What about arms trading? 'No. Categorically and absolutely not. I consider it morally wrong, akin to drug trafficking. I’m also not impressed by those developing spyware and marketing it globally. I worked exclusively with open-source tools. 'As for employing generals and high-ranking officials, there’s nothing unusual about that. In Israel, it got attention because I brought in security experts, but at the same time, I also hired experts across many fields. That’s all there is to it. In any case, this is all in the past, and I’ve imposed silence on myself regarding this topic to avoid causing any disruptions to more important matters. For me, those years shaped my understanding of the region and its potential. I met a population that was completely different from the stereotypes I had in my mind.' Alongside his economic ventures, Kochavi cultivated close and personal relationships with several key Arab leaders in the Middle East. 'I’ve met most of the region’s leaders and have very close, intimate relationships with them. But back then, I was unique. Today, that’s no longer the case; there are many Israelis doing business there and building relationships. Regardless, Israel’s relationship with the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia has the potential to be a regional and global game-changer. If we can establish ties that go beyond security, it will have a tremendous impact on Israeli society. 'These are nations led by relatively young, innovative and calculated leaders. Yes, they have immense oil and gas reserves, but money alone is no guarantee of power or success. Often, it’s a recipe for destruction. Venezuela has oil and gas, so does Iraq. You need intelligence and leadership. 'Even though they sit on vast energy reserves, they understand they can’t rely on that alone. That’s why they’re investing in areas like artificial intelligence and energy. The transformation of the UAE into a global hub for trade and commerce was planned 35 years ago. Just think of the courage it took to sign an agreement with Israel. It’s a leadership decision that leaves me in awe.' Do you think the Trump administration will sustain the momentum? 'There’s potential here for a big regional surprise. Saudi Arabia is a central axis in the Islamic world and the Middle East. It used to be said that the Middle East is a tent with two poles: one is Saudi Arabia, and the other is Egypt. In the arena Israel is operating in, the Abraham Accords and regional cooperation carry tremendous weight. As for what lies ahead, many commentators are confident they know the future. I’m not one of them.' 'You’re talking to someone who struggles with very serious mental issues' Today, it seems almost obvious that immense amounts of data circulating globally can be harnessed for knowledge and insights, but Kochavi was ahead of the curve, one of the first to see its potential. To understand how he arrived at his current focus on pediatric care, it’s worth tracing his journey. After growing up in Haifa and completing military service in Unit 8200 ('I had a brilliant military career that ended after a year in the reserves'), Kochavi moved to the U.S. in the early 1990s. 'I was torn about whether I wanted to be a historian like my father and brother (both history professors). At university, I researched the correlation between Isaac Newton’s scientific and theological thinking. But ultimately, I made a dramatic decision to leave. I wanted independence and security. A core part of my worldview is that you can’t rely on governments, no matter which ones. You need to be able to provide yourself with security and independence.' In the United States, where Kochavi continues to work to this day (without American citizenship—he says, 'I enter the U.S. just like you, standing in the long line'), he met Stephen Ross, a Jewish-American real estate mogul with a fortune estimated at tens of billions of dollars, and began working for him. While working in real estate, Kochavi recalls, 'I identified the emerging field of data analysis and started a small company focused on security—but only through data. Today, everyone does it, but we were among the first to realize how data can help identify threats. We didn’t deal with fences and guards, but with protection through behavior.' Behavior-based protection involves identifying anomalies in regular behavioral patterns. For example, a person flying from the U.S. to Israel via Nigeria without any family or business ties there—an anomaly worth noting. 'We didn’t analyze data solely in terms of counterterrorism,' Kochavi explains. 'I was interested in how you collect data to provide insights into spatial reality. We tried to understand why traffic jams happen, predict disasters and natural phenomena, monitor the development of health conditions or manage a large port—it was all about data.' In the years following the 9/11 attacks, the field of homeland security skyrocketed, and for Kochavi, who was already deeply involved, it brought significant opportunities—and success. Later, Kochavi founded AGT International, which grew into a massive company with deals worth billions of dollars. He expanded not only his business ventures but also the methods of data mining, adding a new ingredient to his data 'recipe': sensors that measure the human body in addition to those that monitor the environment. This field is known as the 'Internet of Things.' > 'The concept behind AGT,' Kochavi says, 'was that we live in two worlds—the physical and the digital—and to create a complete picture, you need the interaction between them. What interested me was understanding human behavior through technology.' Around AGT International, Kochavi built a network of companies that explored various fields of data generation and utilization, such as cyber, media, gaming and personal training. For example, he equipped UFC fighters (and their gloves, the ring and their trainers) with sensors, models during Fashion Week (including Elon Musk’s mother, a former model whom he describes as 'a very nice woman') and even bulls in rodeo competitions. The data was broadcast in real time to enhance the audience’s experience. Kochavi also mined the darkest corners of the Internet to create Dark Net, an innovative documentary series he developed with his other daughter, Adi. Released in 2016, it highlighted the dangers of the digital world. He also identified rising antisemitism online, which led to the creation of Eva.Stories, and more. 'Everything,' Kochavi says, 'was part of studying and understanding human behavior.' Kochavi’s various ventures have performed quite well, allowing him to continue operating without bringing in outside investors. His companies are always private. This is why his net worth remains unknown, and he, of course, doesn’t disclose it. However, estimates suggest he is a billionaire. You could have made much more if you went public. 'You’re talking to someone who struggles with very serious mental issues. I value privacy, which is why I don’t give many interviews. I want a quiet life, which is why I don’t take my companies public. I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to do that. For me, the most important dimension is freedom.' 'Revolutionizing the future of young generations in Israel and around the world' It’s possible to trace how Kochavi’s journey in data collection and utilization—from satellites and sensors to social media and gaming—took him from defense to focusing on pediatric care. 'You can see there’s a very clear narrative,' Kochavi confirms. 'At first, it was about understanding the physical environment. Then we said: OK, let’s focus on something even more important than the environment—the human being.' At first, his work aimed at entertainment, later shifting toward care. 'It was all part of the learning process. Even back then, I told people: eventually, we’ll use this knowledge to understand children and help them. But you can’t put sensors on children. Then we thought: wait, there is a sensor that every child has—the phone.' Around that time, artificial intelligence burst onto the scene. For Kochavi’s companies, which dealt with analyzing massive amounts of data, AI fit like a glove. Unsurprisingly, he’s excited. 'The world is changing. Technologies merging with new knowledge spark revolutions. We’re at a crossroads that will reshape the future. Artificial intelligence will create a new world order—a new economic order, a new social order. Despite the dangers and challenges it presents, AI has the potential to drive extremely significant changes. To me, its greatest power will be in providing personalized support for every child’s development and health during the critical stages of their life.' Don’t you think your perspective on artificial intelligence is overly utopian? 'Granted it’s heading in other directions as well, but I ask myself what good I can do with AI. Countries that use artificial intelligence wisely will be able to significantly improve public health—and at lower costs. AI can dismantle the social order where people in central Israel get more than those in the periphery. You’re right about the dangers, but there are also aspects that can positively influence the future of humanity, and I don’t think we should be ashamed to say that.' This is where Kochavi’s latest project, Korro AI, comes into play. Like Eva.Stories, Korro is aimed at children and accessed through a phone screen, but the similarities end there. Korro is an AI therapist—or, to put it more elegantly, an AI-based therapeutic platform designed to support children’s motor, cognitive and emotional (primarily) development through interactive gameplay. The company is launching in Israel, the United States, and soon in other countries. Two of Korro’s applications are already in use in Israel. The first is a relatively limited feature on Clalit Health Services’ app under its Clalit Active program which is aimed at reducing stress and anxiety in adults through breathing exercises, movement and mindfulness. While there are plenty of similar apps, what sets Korro apart is its integration of real-time metric analysis, such as breathing patterns and heart rate, offering tailored feedback and guidance to the user during the session. I tried it. It’s incredibly calming and effective. During the seven-minute session, I felt less inclined to wish for a meteorite to crash into Earth and end it all. Few things are more important than easing, even slightly, the immense stress weighing on the Israeli psyche these days. After all, we’re all tense, anxious and depressed. It’s comforting to have something—someone, even—that truly pays attention to how we breathe, even if it’s artificial intelligence. Most importantly, I found myself wanting to return to it again and again. 'The current events are profoundly affecting children in Israel,' says Kochavi. 'We must declare a state of mental health emergency for Israel’s children. The ability to provide early intervention and rapid treatment for such a large number of children requires artificial intelligence—there’s no other way. The knowledge we have today about human development, especially during the critical years up to age 17 when the brain is still shaping, is enormous. Our job now is to apply it and reach every single child, everywhere. 'And what’s happening in the meantime? According to official statistics, one in four children in the United States faces developmental, motor or mental health challenges. I don’t know the exact numbers for Israel, but it’s clear there’s an issue. We are treading carefully on this sensitive ground. 'In my view, future generations will consider us a primitive society for failing to fully understand the significance of these critical years. After all, what’s missed during this decisive time is extremely difficult to fix later—if it can be fixed at all. Here, we have an opportunity to introduce an AI therapist at the most crucial stage. The potential is immense. Technology will set us free.' Maccabi Health Services is already offering a more comprehensive application of Korro designed for children with motor issues. The app has been in use for some time as part of a pilot program involving a few dozen children, and it will soon roll out on a broader scale. I tried it as well, and as far as I can tell, it’s excellent. Korro integrates several advanced capabilities. The first is highly sophisticated image recognition technology, which analyzes thousands of parameters. The phone essentially watches you with a keen eye, examining every tiny movement of every facial muscle, while factoring in sweating, breathing, heart rate, posture, movement and more. From this data, it produces detailed assessments. The second capability is a powerful AI engine that constantly updates with the latest expert knowledge. 'We’ve downloaded insights from some of the world’s leading minds in mental health and child development,' Kochavi explains. 'It’s as if I’m bringing the world’s top pediatric specialist to the bedside of every child, everywhere, to examine them.' The third feature is the ability to generate, in real time, customized activities, exercises and games tailored to the patient, which adapt and progress with them. The fourth is producing detailed reports for therapists and parents. This app, I felt, truly sees you. 'We’re building something here with the goal of revolutionizing the future of young generations in Israel and around the world,' says Kochavi, pointing to data showing that combining Korro with human therapy yields impressive results and ensures continuity of care. Pathos makes me slightly skeptical, so I called Hila Moshayev, national director of occupational therapy at Maccabi Health Services and a child development expert. She told me that dozens of Israeli children and therapists have been using the app for about five months, and the results have been excellent. The children are enthusiastic about the app and use it at home, the therapists are pleased with the reports and the parents are seeing progress. She added that in recent months, Korro has proven invaluable for providing remote care to displaced children, helping to maintain uninterrupted treatment. The app also strengthens the bond between therapist and child by encouraging the child’s independent progress. 'The child’s interaction with a human therapist is critical,' Kochavi emphasizes. 'Treatment must be hybrid. Under no circumstances can children be treated without a human therapist, and there is no intention to change that.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s1hwfirvjx	2025-01-15T08:49:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/B1115Y2tcLyx/B1115Y2tcLyx_0_185_1811_1020_0_small.jpg

Putin, 'acts of air terror' and the secret message from the White...	Six months after packages burst into flames at airports and warehouses in Poland, Germany and England, the Polish prime minister accuses Russia of plotting 'acts of air terror' around the world Russia planned 'acts of air terror' against Poland and other countries, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Wednesday after meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Warsaw. The Polish premier's statement came two days after the New York Times reported that the U.S. last year had sent an urgent warning to Moscow after American intelligence agencies said a Russian military unit was preparing to send explosive packages on cargo planes to the U.S. The message to the Russians was that if there is a mass casualty disaster in the air or on the ground, the U.S. will consider Russia as an accessory to terror. Security officials have said that parcels which exploded at logistics depots in Europe were part of a test run for a Russian plot to trigger explosions on cargo flights to the United States. The explosions occurred in depots in Britain, Germany and Poland in July. Russia has denied involvement in the incidents and Tusk did not mention them specifically. 'I will not go into details, I can only confirm the validity of fears that Russia was planning acts of air terror, not only against Poland, but against airlines around the world,' Tusk told a news conference. He did not say what acts he was referring to or elaborate on the contents of the information. The Russian embassy in Warsaw and the Russian foreign ministry did not reply to requests for comment on Tusk's statement. > The Kremlin has dismissed previous Western claims that Russia sponsored acts of sabotage and attacks in Europe. The pro-Western Polish government under Tusk has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine in its war against Russia and has accused Moscow of promoting a hybrid war against Warsaw and others as revenge for their support of Kyiv. Poland claims that Russia and its ally Belarus are working to intensify the migrant crisis on the EU's eastern borders hoping to spread division in the union. According to the New York Times, the White House's warning did reach Putin, and administration officials say it has had its effect, with the wave of package detonations in Europe currently halted. However, it is unclear whether Putin has ordered a halt to the operation and for how long. Officials also told the newspaper that Russia may be using the time to build better explosive devices that will be easier to evade detection during testing. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj4ahubpje	2025-01-15T08:15:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/ByQ00BcbS1e/ByQ00BcbS1e_0_111_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

UN rights chief urges reconciliation process in first Syria visit	U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk called on Wednesday for a Syrian national reconciliation process to ensure justice for crimes committed over the past five decades of iron-fisted rule by the Assad family. In the first visit ever by a U.N. rights commissioner to Damascus, Turk met with the head of Syria's new administration, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and with victims of crimes the conflict. 'Transitional justice is crucial as Syria moves forward,' Turk told reporters in Damascus. 'Revenge and vengeance are never the answer. Instead there needs to be a fully nationally-owned, healing, truth-telling and reconciliation process.' He said such a process would address 'past wrongs that have been committed by all actors in Syria over the past five decades', the period during which Assad and his father Hafez before him ruled over Syria. Turk said his office had been remotely documenting evidence of crimes in Syria since war broke out in 2011 and that it would work with other U.N. agencies to address them. He said some Syrians were still unable to return home due to 'demographic engineering' that had stripped their land and property rights. 'The extent of the atrocity crimes truly beggars belief.' The commissioner also called for the international community to urgently reconsider and lift sectoral sanctions in Syria, which he said were impacting all Syrians.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skifgprvyg	2025-01-15T07:21:10-08:00

Trump State Dept nominee Rubio promises US-focused foreign policy...	Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio promised a robust foreign policy focused on American interests at his nomination hearing on Wednesday for secretary of state under President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20. A China hawk and staunch backer of Israel, the 53-year-old Rubio is expected to comfortably win confirmation by the full Senate. Democrats backed him as soon as Trump announced his nomination to become the top U.S. diplomat, a sharp contrast with some more controversial nominees who drew skepticism even from Trump's own party. In his opening statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he has served for 14 years, Rubio said he sees a world in chaos where it will not be easy to restore order. 'But it can and will only happen if it is built on a simple foundational element - a strong and confident America engaged in the world based on our national interest before all else,' he said in prepared remarks. Rubio has strongly backed Israel. Last year, he said he would not call for a ceasefire in Gaza and believed Israel should destroy 'every element' of Palestinian terror group Hamas. 'These people are vicious animals,' he added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkgsourv1e	2025-01-15T06:49:26-08:00

Erdogan demands Israeli withdrawal from Syria, warns of 'unfavora...	Turkish president says Israel's 'aggressive actions' must end immediately, calls Gaza cease-fire 'opportunity for lasting peace and stability across the region' Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday demanded that Israel cease its 'aggressive actions' toward neighboring Syria, and withdraw its forces or it will cause 'unfavorable outcomes for everyone.' 'The aggressive actions of the forces attacking Syrian territory, Israel, in particular, must come to an end as soon as possible. Otherwise, it will cause unfavorable outcomes for everyone,' Erdogan said in his address during a group meeting of his Justice and Development Party. Senior Israeli officials stated last week that Israel will need to maintain a 15-kilometer 'security buffer' inside Syrian territory, where the IDF will ensure a presence to prevent forces loyal to the new regime from launching rockets toward the Golan Heights. Additionally, Israel plans to establish a 60-kilometer 'zone of influence' within Syria, allowing for intelligence control to monitor and mitigate emerging threats in the area. The Foreign Ministry said it rejects Erdogan's threats and said in a statement that it would advise the Turkish preident to avoid making such threats and that Israel would continue to protect its borders. Erdogan also addressed the ongoing negotiations for a hostage release deal and a cease-fire, stating, 'With the achievement of a cease-fire in Gaza, where genocide has been ongoing for 15 months, a significant opportunity will arise for lasting peace and stability across the region. We are closely monitoring the cease-fire talks between Israel and Hamas and hope to receive positive news soon.' > The Turkish president also stated that Ankara had the power and ability to 'crush' all terrorists in Syria, including Islamic State and Kurdish militants while urging all countries to 'take their hands off' Syria. Ankara has said the new Syrian administration must be given an opportunity to address the YPG presence but also threatened to mount a new cross-border operation against the militia based in northeast Syria if its demands are not met. 'Regarding fabricated excuses like Islamic State, these have no convincing side anymore,' Erdogan said, referring to the U.S. position that the YPG was a key partner against Islamic State in Syria and that it plays a vital role guarding prison camps where the Islamist militants are kept. 'If there is really a fear of the Islamic State threat in Syria and the region, the biggest power that has the will and power to resolve this issue is Turkey,' he said. 'Everyone should take their hands off Syria and we, along with our Syrian siblings, will crush the heads of Islamic State, the YPG, and other terrorist organizations in a short time.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1gnx4sp1l	2025-01-15T05:46:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/BJ4fBbk8ke/BJ4fBbk8ke_0_0_853_488_0_small.jpg
Hamas has given green light to Gaza deal, Israeli official says	Palestinian official says terror group responded positively to mediators’ proposal, predicting deal could be signed soon; Netanyahu's office counters, saying Hamas yet to respond; negotiation teams will brief Netanyahu as government readies for Cabinet meeting Hamas has given the green light to a hostage deal, a senior Israeli official told Reuters on Wednesday. However, the Prime Minister’s Office tempered expectations, saying, 'Hamas has yet to provide a formal response.' The government and Security Cabinet will convene on Thursday to address the developments. Pro-Hamas Qatari newspaper The New Arab reported that Hamas leadership in Doha met with leaders of Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine to present the final draft of the Gaza cease-fire agreement. 'The resistance factions' stance on the draft is unified and positive,' a Palestinian source told the paper. The report also noted that mediators have received maps detailing the IDF’s withdrawal and presence in Gaza during the agreement’s initial phase. The official announcement is expected to take place in Cairo, contingent on all parties’ approval. > Meanwhile, a senior Palestinian official told Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese network Al Mayadeen that 'Hamas has responded positively to the mediators’ final proposal. The cease-fire agreement is expected to be signed tonight or tomorrow,' the official added. Israeli officials have stressed the importance of the next 24 to 48 hours, with one describing it as a 'now or never' moment. 'If a deal isn’t finalized within this timeframe, the momentum could be lost,' another official warned. Israel has dismissed Hamas’ claims, circulated in Arab media, that Israel is delaying the agreement, calling them an attempt to exert last-minute pressure for concessions. Israeli sources said these accusations also reflect internal divisions within Hamas leadership in Gaza. Negotiators in Doha are reportedly making final refinements to the deal, with sources saying, 'The teams are focused on perfecting the language of the agreement, but we are still waiting for Hamas’ formal response. For now, all we’re seeing are smokescreens.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1ukybhdkl	2025-01-15T05:11:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/07/H1WZmxMN1x/H1WZmxMN1x_0_0_3000_2053_0_small.jpg

Hamas accused of stalling hostage deal, Palestinians shift blame ...	Hamas leader Mohammed Sinwar approves proposed hostage deal in principle, Wall Street Journal reports; Palestinian source accuses Israel of withholding key details, including withdrawal maps Arab media reported Wednesday morning that Hamas has accused Israel of introducing new conditions that complicate finalizing a deal to release hostages held in Gaza. Israeli officials swiftly denied the claims, with a senior Israeli source calling them 'Hamas lies aimed at evading responsibility for the deal.' According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, citing Arab sources, Mohammed Sinwar, the brother and apparent successor of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, has agreed in principle to the terms of the proposed hostage-prisoner exchange deal. This agreement reportedly came just hours after Hamas publicly announced for the first time that the deal was in its 'final stages.' Despite Sinwar's reported approval, a Palestinian source familiar with the negotiations told Lebanon’s Hezbollah-affiliated Al Mayadeen network that Israeli actions are disrupting progress on a cease-fire agreement. The source claimed Israel has not provided a military withdrawal map for Gaza, nor details on the management of the Rafah border crossing and the entry of aid trucks. 'Israel has also failed to outline a prisoner swap mechanism or clarify how the wounded will be evacuated for treatment,' the source said. 'While there is general Israeli consent, these critical details are delaying the agreement and the start of a cease-fire.' Sky News Arabic, citing unnamed sources, reported that new Israeli conditions could derail the negotiations, including a demand to maintain a 700-meter military presence inside Rafah and insistence on veto power over the list of Palestinian prisoners to be released. Negotiators from both sides remain engaged in talks in Doha, Qatar. On Tuesday, a senior Hamas official told Reuters that the group has yet to provide its response to mediators, claiming Israel has not submitted maps outlining the withdrawal of its forces from Gaza. Israeli officials have denied this claim. Separately, CNN reported Wednesday that the release of Palestinian prisoners will occur in six stages. The first five stages are expected to include the release of 100 to 120 Palestinian detainees in exchange for three Israeli hostages per stage. The sixth stage will reportedly be the largest, involving the release of more than three Israeli hostages. Palestinian Prisoner Authority spokesman Taher Shariteh told CNN that this final group of prisoners will include individuals who were released as part of the 2011 deal for the release of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit but were later rearrested by Israel. 'Some of them are serving life sentences,' Shariteh said. > Arab newspapers highlighted the ongoing negotiations for a Gaza cease-fire, with varied takes on the status of the discussions. The Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar described the deal as 'delayed but not collapsing.' Qatar’s pro-Hamas newspaper The New Arab reported that negotiations are 'focused on implementation mechanisms.' London-based Al-Quds Al-Arabi claimed the cease-fire agreement is 'in its final stage,' adding that 'the Israeli military is preparing to withdraw from the Rafah crossing.' Saudi daily Asharq Al-Awsat reported: 'The Gaza cease-fire is nearing completion, awaiting official announcement.' The Palestinian Health Ministry has reportedly begun preparations to receive prisoners expected to be freed under the proposed exchange deal. Hospitals and their directors have been instructed to prepare facilities accordingly. A letter issued by the Palestinian Authority read: 'Ahead of the prisoner exchange and the return of our freed detainees from Israeli prisons, immediate efforts are underway to prepare and equip internal medicine and surgical clinics to provide the necessary medical care for our brothers.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told members of the Hope Forum representing families of hostages: 'I am prepared for a prolonged cease-fire if it ensures the return of the hostages. It’s a matter of days or hours. We await Hamas’ response, after which implementation can begin immediately.' Netanyahu added: 'Hamas has not yet responded. Everything being reported now is speculation.' He also commented that when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump assumes office, 'the rules of the game will fundamentally change. Every cease-fire violation will face a harsh and unprecedented response.' As negotiations continued in Doha overnight, Israeli airstrikes targeted dozens of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad sites across Gaza. Among the targets were senior operatives and terrorist concentrations in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah. The IDF said that approximately 50 terrorist sites were struck over the past 24 hours. Hamas acknowledged for the first time that significant progress had been made in the negotiations, with the group declaring that 'the freedom of our heroic prisoners is near.' Hamas also called on Palestinians to escalate confrontations with Israeli forces 'in response to the increasing crimes against our people, holy sites and prisoners.' A Hamas source told CNN that the group is 'very close to an agreement' with Israel, while another told Reuters that progress had been made on key issues, though gaps remain. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hym8ugrwjg	2025-01-15T02:18:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/rkFoCnYByl/rkFoCnYByl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
To prevent false claims, Israeli guards to film prisoners during ...	In first, Israel Prison Service to equip guards with body cameras to record prisoners' physical and medical condition prior to their release In preparation for the release of Palestinian security prisoners as part of the emerging hostage deal with Hamas, the Israel Prison Service will equip guards with body cameras to ensure transparency and prevent false claims regarding the detainees' physical condition. This move is part of an innovative pilot program, guided by IPS Commissioner Kobi Yaakobi, to document prisoners’ health status before their release and maintain organizational accountability. The cameras will record every stage of the release process, providing clear and accurate documentation of prisoners' physical condition in real time. IPS head of security and operations Avichai Ben Hamo emphasized that the program is a vital step toward increasing transparency with the public and external parties while ensuring the security and order of the prison staff. 'We want to ensure the release process is carried out professionally and accurately, and to prevent any challenges to the integrity of the process,' Ben Hamo said. > Meanwhile, the government informed the Supreme Court that 3,464 detainees from the Gaza Strip are currently held in Israeli prisons, and 151 detainees have been released for various reasons. This update came following a petition filed by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel. According to CNN, the release of Palestinian prisoners will occur in six phases. The first five phases will involve the release of 100 to 120 prisoners per phase, in exchange for three hostages each time. The sixth phase, the largest, will include the release of prisoners involved in the 2011 deal for the release of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. These individuals, some of whom were re-arrested by Israel after their release, are serving life sentences. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkyq0xrpjx	2025-01-15T01:48:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/BJKq4vN41x/BJKq4vN41x_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Radical pro-Hezbollah imam to address Trump inauguration	In historic first, imam to join pastor and rabbi in delivering prayers at presidential inauguration; choice of Husham al-Husainy sparks controversy over past statements, including support for Hezbollah. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's campaign has unveiled the official schedule for his inauguration festivities, which will span three days in Washington, D.C. The celebration will include traditional military displays, inaugural balls, a performance by country music star Carrie Underwood, and tickets priced at $1 million for an exclusive candlelit dinner with the president and first lady. For the first time in U.S. history, the presidential inauguration will feature an invocation by an imam, alongside a pastor and a rabbi. Trump has chosen Imam Husham al-Husainy of Dearborn, Michigan, to deliver the prayer. Al-Husainy, who represents the Iraqi-American community, has faced scrutiny for past statements that critics describe as anti-Israel and extremist. In a televised debate with a Christian pastor, al-Husainy once remarked that the Quran foretells 'good news' of an impending attack on Israel and predicted Muslims would 'enter Jerusalem and kick the Jews.' Al-Husainy has also publicly defended Hezbollah, a group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States. During a 2007 interview on Fox News’ Hannity, host Sean Hannity pressed al-Husainy to acknowledge Hezbollah as a terrorist group. Al-Husainy refused, saying, 'That's your interpretation. Hezbollah is a Lebanese organization.' When pressed further, he asserted, 'There’s a biblical meaning to Hezbollah—people of God.' The imam’s participation in a pro-Hezbollah rally in Dearborn in 2006 has also drawn criticism. At the event, he appeared on stage holding a picture of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and reportedly wished death to the Saudis over their involvement in Yemen, calling them 'agents of the Jews.' Al-Husainy has also previously mourned the death of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s Quds Force, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2020. A Facebook post attributed to him expressed condolences over Soleimani’s death, further fueling controversy. The Middle East Forum, a conservative think tank focused on radical Islam, described al-Husainy as a 'radical, pro-Hezbollah Shia imam' with 'a significant history of extremism.' The inclusion of al-Husainy in Trump’s inaugural proceedings has sparked debate, with critics questioning the message it sends about the administration’s stance on extremism and its approach to Middle Eastern issues. So far, neither Trump’s campaign nor al-Husainy has commented on the criticism. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s17iiervyg	2025-01-15T01:23:16-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/14/SyeGMiS4wJx/SyeGMiS4wJx_169_0_995_560_0_small.jpg
Saudi-Israeli normalization a 'huge priority,' says Trump envoy	Incoming National Security Advisor Mike Waltz identifies normalization between Jerusalem and Riyadh as key objective that will change the region; Waltz outlines vision for demilitarized Gaza and clarifies initial hostage deal does not mark end of war Mike Waltz, the incoming national security advisor for the Trump administration, has declared that achieving a peace agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia is a 'huge priority' for the incoming administration. Waltz emphasized the need to 'eliminate these terrorist organizations,' secure the release of hostages, and make progress toward Riyadh. 'Let’s call it what it is: the next phase of the Abraham Accords,' he said in an interview on the popular American podcast Call Me Back. Waltz described the potential Israel-Saudi Arabia normalization as 'a tremendous historic region-changing agreement.' Waltz also suggested that Iran played a key role in igniting the recent war through its proxy, Hamas, to derail progress. 'This is why I firmly believe that Iran lit the fuse—Hamas—to blow everything up,' Waltz said, referencing the escalation before October 7. 'The sides were very close, and that’s the goal: get our people out, eliminate these terrorist organizations, and start focusing on economic and political solutions.' Speaking to podcast host Dan Senor, author of Start-Up Nation and a prominent American businessman, Waltz made it clear that 'all options are on the table' when it comes to Iran and its nuclear program. He reiterated President Trump’s firm stance against allowing Tehran to possess nuclear weapons, stating, 'President Trump will not tolerate Iran holding nuclear arms.' > Waltz, widely regarded as an experienced and serious figure in the new administration and a strong supporter of Israel, warned of the dire consequences of a nuclear-armed Iran. 'If you think the region is unstable, violent, and at war now, imagine it under a nuclear umbrella controlled by Iran,' he said. He highlighted Iran’s proxies, from the Houthis and Hezbollah to Hamas and militias in Syria and Iraq, and noted Iran’s repeated threats to annihilate Israel. 'We must take this very seriously,' he added. 'Every American should understand that any kind of nuclear confrontation in the region would be catastrophic for the entire world.' Addressing the future of Gaza after the hostage negotiations, Waltz said the territory must be completely demilitarized, and Hamas must have no role in its governance. When asked about the fate of hostages not included in the initial deal, Waltz expressed his determination: 'These poor individuals—Israelis, Americans, and citizens of various other nations—are in tunnels under the worst imaginable conditions. They are being used as human shields and subjected to horrific abuse. We will do everything we can to bring them all home, alive or deceased, to ensure they receive a proper burial.' When Senor asked if the hostage deal signaled the end of the war, Waltz dismissed the notion. 'Hamas may hope so, but we’ve made it clear: Gaza must be fully demilitarized, Hamas must be dismantled so it cannot regroup, and Israel has every right to defend itself. Those goals remain unchanged.' Waltz added that the majority of Israelis support the hostage deal and credited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s leadership for advancing it. Reflecting on past obstacles, Waltz said Hamas previously believed it would receive support from Hezbollah in Lebanon. 'One day, the full story will be told about what I consider one of the most extraordinary covert operations in modern history,' he said, referring to Israel’s actions that weakened Hezbollah’s capabilities and leadership. Discussing the broader regional implications, Waltz highlighted how dismantling Hamas and weakening Iranian influence could open the door for Lebanon to break free from Tehran’s grip and even destabilize Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria. 'This cascade of positive effects could lead to the most promising situation the region has seen in decades,' he said. Waltz criticized the Biden administration’s handling of the situation and suggested it emboldened Hamas. He pointed to protests on American college campuses supporting Hamas and U.S. policy decisions that he described as undermining Israel. 'Every time Hamas saw news of these anti-Israel demonstrations or statements from Washington that criticized Israel, they believed sacrificing their own people to turn global opinion against Israel was worth it,' he said. Waltz also noted Vice President Kamala Harris’s boycott of Netanyahu’s speech to Congress and other perceived slights as factors that played into Hamas’s hands. Finally, Waltz underscored the Trump administration’s commitment to ensuring Hamas and similar groups have no future role in Gaza. 'Hamas, ISIS, and al-Qaeda have no place in governance. We must eradicate this cancer, not just for Israel’s sake but for the Palestinian people too. We will never achieve a stable future or a truly peaceful region until this threat is removed.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1h002ysvkl	2025-01-15T00:24:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/12/SkRUpPefke/SkRUpPefke_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Two Israeli soldiers seriously wounded by explosive in West Bank	Hours after Israeli strike killed six Palestinians in Jenin, IDF military jeep hits explosive device in neighboring Kabatiya; 2 soldiers from Kfir and Menashe Brigades severely hurt, reservist sustains minor injuries Two Israeli soldiers were seriously wounded overnight when their military jeep hit an explosive device in the Palestinian West Bank town of Kabatiya, the IDF said Wednesday. A reservist soldier from the Kfir Brigade sustained minor injuries. The injured were evacuated to a hospital for treatment, and their families were notified. Hours earlier, an Israeli Air Force strike in Jenin killed six Palestinians, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The operation, carried out jointly by the IDF and the Shin Bet, also left several others injured. > Anwar Rajab, spokesperson for the Palestinian security forces, condemned the airstrike, calling it a 'premeditated intervention designed to undermine security and thwart efforts to restore stability.' He accused Israel of intentionally disrupting national initiatives aimed at protecting Palestinians. Last month, the Palestinian security forces launched a crackdown on members of the Jenin Battalion, a local armed group affiliated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad. More than 280 terrorists were arrested on charges including shooting at Palestinian Authority forces, illegal arms possession and collaborating with hostile foreign entities. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryrr11lrvkg	2025-01-14T23:44:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/10/SJ4OeR2A8Jl/SJ4OeR2A8Jl_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Iranian official alleges Israel sabotaged nuclear equipment with ...	Vice President Mohammad Javad Zarif claims explosives found in centrifuge platforms bought for Tehran’s nuclear program; President Massoud Pezeshkian warns Iran will react to any attack on its nuclear facilities; 'We do not fear war' Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran's vice president for strategic affairs and former foreign minister, has accused Israel of embedding explosives in centrifuge components acquired for Tehran's nuclear program in what he described as an undisclosed attempt by Israel to sabotage Iran's nuclear infrastructure. In a statement reported by the opposition-linked Persian-language media outlet Iran International, Zarif said, 'Our colleagues procured a centrifuge platform for the Atomic Energy Organization, only to discover that explosives had been implanted within it.' Zarif did not specify when the alleged incident occurred. The claim follows a series of reported acts of sabotage targeting Iran’s nuclear facilities, including a 2021 explosion at the Natanz centrifuge plant, which Tehran labeled as 'nuclear terrorism.' While Iran has not fully detailed the incident, Israel has not confirmed or denied involvement. Zarif highlighted the security vulnerabilities created by international sanctions on Iran, which he said forced the country to rely on intermediaries for acquiring sensitive equipment. 'Instead of sourcing equipment directly from manufacturers, sanctions compel us to work through multiple intermediaries,' Zarif explained. 'If Israel infiltrates even one intermediary, they can plant anything, as they did in this case.' In response to the incident, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard reportedly confiscated communication devices and conducted extensive security checks to prevent recurrence. Iran’s Civil Aviation Authority also banned electronic devices, including cellphones, on commercial flights. 'This is one of the many damages caused by sanctions,' Zarif added. 'Beyond economic losses, they have created significant security risks.' Zarif compared the situation to a Mossad operation in Lebanon last September, where 12 Hezbollah operatives were killed and thousands injured after pagers rigged with explosives by Mossad detonated across the country. The following day, walkie-talkies used by the terror group also exploded, resulting in 20 more fatalities and 450 injuries. A Mossad operative speaking to CBS’s 60 Minutes revealed details of the operation. '[T]hose people without hands and eyes... are walking proof of our superiority all around the Middle East. 'We want them to feel vulnerable,' he said. The operative hinted that Israel has 'moved on to the next thing' in its intelligence efforts. > The report also highlighted the U.S. response to Iran’s ballistic missile strikes on Israel in October. The Biden administration imposed additional sanctions on six entities involved in Iranian oil trade and six Iranian vessels. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the time, 'These measures aim to disrupt revenue streams that the Iranian regime uses to fund its nuclear program, develop missiles, support terrorist proxies and perpetuate conflict across the Middle East.' Pezeshkian: Attack on nuclear sites will be to the detriment of all actors Iranian President Masoud Pezhkian said in an interview with NBC on Tuesday that while Iran does not seek war, it will respond decisively to any attacks on its nuclear facilities, particularly under the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. '[N]aturally enough, we will react to any action. We do not fear war, but we do not seek it,' he said, adding: 'I solemnly hope that this will not transpire because it will be to the detriment of all the actors, not only and merely us.' He dismissed allegations that Iran is building nuclear weapons, claiming such accusations are being used as pretexts for aggression. Pezhkian also rejected claims that Iran’s influence in the region has weakened following setbacks to its 'axis of resistance' allies. '[C]omparing to last year inside the country, we’re more coherent. We’re more robust. We have better participation. We have a more solid security in the country,' he said. On efforts to secure peace, Pezeshkian added, 'We do whatever we can in order for peace to prevail in the region.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryb6v1hvyg	2025-01-14T23:12:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/04/25/9207651/9207651_0_39_981_552_0_small.jpg
Hostage deal Phase II explained: What’s next and why the silence?	Concerns mount for families of 65 hostages excluded from Phase I of the deal; their fate hinges on Israel and Hamas navigating significant obstacles to finalize agreements that will shape Gaza’s post-war future, a complex process fraught with challenges What Israel vigorously denied just a week ago is no longer possible to deny: If there are no last-minute surprises, then Israel and Hamas are closer than ever to another hostage deal - which will include a list of 33 living and dead Israeli hostages in its first phase, and only later, apparently, all of the hostages. This leaves the families of the 65 hostages who were left out of Phase I, which was defined as a 'humanitarian exchange' - and from which hostage Youssef Ziyadne, whose body was returned to Israel in an IDF operation, was certainly removed. Amid hopes for the return of 33 hostages in Phase I, families have valid concerns that Phase II may not be implemented. With over a year passing between previous deals and negotiations like those for Gilad Shalit taking more than five years, fears of delays are justified. And while some talk unrealistically about releasing the hostages without releasing terrorists from prison, in practice this is clearly not the case - and when you add to this the heavy prices that Phase II entails for Israel, a very large diplomatic maneuvering space is needed for it to ultimately be implemented. On the surface, and although much is still hidden from view regarding the details of the outline, it is already clear that throughout Phase I, the IDF will remain in the buffer zone in the Gaza Strip, will hold positions on the Philadelphia Corridor, and will evacuate the Netzarim Corridor only while activating a screening mechanism for Gazans who wish to return to the northern Gaza Strip. Alongside this, it is clear that the phase also includes comprehensive and extensive humanitarian aid. However, Phase II, which includes the end of the war, effectively constitutes the beginning of 'the day after' in the Gaza Strip - and therefore the list of demands that Hamas presented in the past regarding it has repeatedly crossed all of Israel's red lines. The terrorist organization's main demand for the release of the 65 Israeli and foreign hostages, which are its last bargaining chip, is to end the war. This is a complete end, a 'sustainable peace' without reservations, within the framework of which Israel will fully withdraw from the Gaza Strip and allow billions of dollars from other countries to pour into its reconstruction. In addition, Hamas is expected to demand the release of a larger number of prisoners for each soldier not included in the Phase I outline - while it also defines the young civilian men as 'soldiers'. The terrorist organization, which wants to present some achievement for the murderous surprise attack it carried out and which also brought disaster to Gaza, is expected to demand that Israel also release more 'heavyweight' prisoners in Phase II. These include, for example, Palestinian leaders such as Marwan Barghouti or Hassan Salameh - a friend of Mohammed Sinwar and a senior member of Hamas' military wing, who is serving 46 life sentences. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for his part, has repeatedly reiterated in recent months that he will not agree to an end to the war without achieving all of its goals, which include the return of all the hostages - but also the collapse of Hamas' rule. Defense Minister Israel Katz even demanded that the IDF present him with a 'plan for defeating Hamas' if the hostages are not released, and claimed that any talk of 'the day after' is irrelevant now, since no other force will replace Hamas as long as the terrorist organization maintains its military strength. However, the IDF, on orders from the political echelon, refrains from operating in areas in the Gaza Strip where hostages are believed to be present, and it is unclear how the terrorist organization can be eliminated without presenting alternatives that will rule the Gaza Strip the day after. According to Yaron Blum, who was the country's coordinator of prisoners and missing persons between 2017 and 2022, one of the main problems with the talks is Israel's avoidance of discussing 'the day after.' Another challenge expected to surface during Phase II, and possibly even during Phase I, is Hamas' use of cynical tactics in negotiations. As seen in the past deal, the group may introduce 'scapegoats' during implementation, forcing Israeli decision-makers into difficult dilemmas and potentially undermining trust. Israel has prepared for this by retaining significant leverage in Phase I, including control of the buffer zone in Gaza and the Philadelphi Corridor. However, these levers will diminish during Phase II. To ensure the release of all hostages, it is crucial that Hamas has something to lose, such as tying Gaza's full rehabilitation to the completion of the process. A third phase guaranteeing this linkage has already been proposed as a solution. Blum highlights another potential lever: While Hamas’ internal leadership focuses on surviving and maintaining control in Gaza, its external leadership seeks to preserve its presence in Qatar and Turkey. If the U.S. applies pressure on these countries to expel Hamas operatives, it could destabilize the organization’s external operations. This, in turn, might force Hamas’ internal leadership to accept an agreement, even if it significantly weakens its position in Gaza. The obstacles in the way and the open questions One of the main difficulties the mediators encountered was the goal declared by each side - which means that the outline for ending the war must allow both Israel and Hamas to declare 'victory.' In other words, if the unexpected does not happen, and Hamas does not back down from its demand to end the war, the question arises of what guarantees Israel will receive that the terrorist organization will indeed not take an active part in governing Gaza. In addition, Israel's security demands must also be met: From the government's perspective, the war must end with no more force in the Gaza Strip that poses a threat to it. Opponents of this approach, including within the defense establishment itself, argue that those who were abandoned should first be returned to the country - and that the super-strategic goals should not be attempted at their expense. The IDF claims that they will know how to deal well with a complete withdrawal. Blum described the concept well: 'The Gaza Strip is not going anywhere, and it will be possible to return to fighting. Hamas will give us the circumstances to do so.' So far, the prime minister and many of his ministers have not agreed to this. In any case, even assuming that the parties agree to go to phase two, which, as stated, includes a return to sustainable calm and a cessation of military operations, the question arises as to what will happen when the participants in the massacre begin to move in the Strip - and Israel will have intelligence on their locations? It could be the Gaza Brigade Commander, Izz ad-Din Haddad or Rafah Brigade Commander Mohammed Shabana, or even Mohammed Sinwar, who replaced his brother Yahya as the leader of Hamas in Gaza. It is clear to every Israeli that these people are mortal, but Hamas is expected to demand that Israel not be able to harm its people. > Another question is how Israel will prevent Hamas from regaining power, and how extensive the mandate it will receive for this will be. In Lebanon, for example, the IDF still attacks Hezbollah targets from time to time on various grounds. It is unclear to what extent Hamas will agree to such Israeli involvement after the end of the war, or whether Israel will act in parallel with the process of releasing the hostages in a way that could lead to its arrest. Post-war Gaza and Saudi Arabia In an attempt to overcome this, the mediators are trying to present an alternative to Hamas rule 'the day after.' But while Hamas and Islamic Jihad have ostensibly agreed to the establishment of a committee of Gazan technocrats to run the enclave, under the control of the Palestinian Authority, it is precisely Chairman Mahmoud Abbas who refuses. Fatah says that they will not cooperate with such a committee, since they claim it is Hamas' way of returning to power - by placing figures identified with it in key positions. In addition, and since Hamas' military power has not been completely eliminated, and the terrorist organization is not expected to agree to disarm, it could pose enormous difficulties for any government that takes its place. All of this leads to the obvious conclusion that in order to embark on Phase Two and the 'day after,' Israel needs to be granted a certain degree of security freedom in the Gaza Strip, something Hamas has so far refused. It may allow a committee not on its behalf to run Gaza, and relinquish its position as the dominant organization, but as mentioned, this will not completely prevent its strengthening, nor will it allow Israel the security calm it expects. But despite all this, the issue of the 'day after' in the Gaza Strip has another axis: Saudi Arabia is not expected to normalize its relations with Israel as long as the war continues. It is also expected to demand a 'path' to a Palestinian state, and an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip - along with agreements regarding the Palestinian Authority's rule there - could serve as an anchor for it. In addition, if Israel agrees to a Saudi and Emirati presence in the Gaza Strip, these countries could help enforce the ceasefire outline and also prevent the rise of Hamas. Last week, the United Arab Emirates had reportedly agreed to participate in the management of Gaza temporarily, along with the U.S. and other countries, and to take care of matters of governance, security, and reconstruction of the destruction - and also to send forces at the invitation of the Palestinian Authority. However, in a letter recently sent by coalition members to Netanyahu, they demanded that Israel not rely on any foreign entity - and not allow another force to replace the IDF in Gaza. All of the problems mentioned here have been addressed in recent weeks by Minister Ron Dermer, among others, who is trying to reach an understanding with the Trump administration regarding what will happen if various scenarios materialize. Israel officials say that while the Biden administration did not provide Israel with full backing, and more than once limited it in armaments, with Trump things are expected to be easier; the assessment is that if the new U.S. president sees that Hamas is not behaving properly and is violating the agreement, then the IDF will have the green light to 'enter into it,' but here too these are only estimates, and right-wing figures recently protested the 'pressure' that Trump is reportedly exerting on Israel to reach an agreement. So what do brokers do? Arab mediators and media outlets are careful to emphasize Phase I in their references to the deal, and for good reason. The U.S., Egypt, and Qatar believe that the first phase is the hardest 'opening blow,' which will lead to a dynamic that will knock down the obstacles on the way to a final end to the war. Therefore, they prefer to 'get the parties pregnant' - and discuss the most complex issues during a lull in the war, during which hostages will be released from time to time. Blum supports this approach and says that despite all the problems, 'we should not talk about Phase II, but rather motivate the other side to agree to Phase I. This will create a relationship of trust between the murderous terrorist organization and Israel, which must release all 98 hostages - four of whom have been there for about 11 years.' He explains that in the first phase, there are international guarantees, and estimates that 'the parties will begin to talk at a low intensity, out of a desire not to blow up the talks.' At the same time, Egypt is trying to accelerate the agreements between Fatah and Hamas, in order to present a suitable alternative government that can rehabilitate the Gaza Strip without the funds flowing en masse into the production of weapons. According to a report in the Qatari Al-Arabi Al-Jadeed in November, Cairo is actually working against Hamas on two parallel axes: the first is the axis of negotiations, and the second is an axis that focuses on intra-Palestinian reconciliation talks, believing that the success of its efforts in Gaza depends on achieving an intra-Palestinian agreement and establishing a committee to govern the Strip. In addition, sources involved in the negotiations believe that if Donald Trump accepts the Gaza Strip without war, he will not allow Israel to easily renew it. In light of his aggressive rhetoric in recent days, it does not seem that the president-elect will easily give up on the release of the remaining 65 hostages - especially since continuing the war would jeopardize normalization with Saudi Arabia, which is out of the question for him. However, there is a major caveat to this: this is a president whose steps are almost impossible to predict, and certainly not to rely on. It is also unclear what Trump's people promised Netanyahu, and whether the prime minister agreed to a 'small deal' because he believes that the Republican president will achieve much more for him later. Returning to uncertainty 'There have never been negotiations like this, in any respect,' says attorney Uri Slonim, who was the advisor on captives and missing persons to eight defense ministers in the past, and even managed the negotiations for the release of the missing navigator Ron Arad. According to him, the fact that the government is linking the release of the hostages to the dismantling of Hamas is also unprecedented, and therefore it is very difficult to estimate what will happen in the second phase. 'There are so many additional components to these negotiations, such as the unique circumstances in which they were conducted during fighting or the scope of the prisoners. War is a dynamic thing, and things can change on the ground in a second.' Blum, meanwhile, suggests that the country do everything it can to free the hostages and not blow up the agreements. 'We've created a situation where the Iranians are not in the region, and they will have a problem transferring funds to Hamas,' he said. 'The isolation of the terrorist organization helps us, and there's also the mediators' fear of Trump and our desire to start off on the right foot with him.' Therefore, he concludes: 'If they do sign Phase I, I will be optimistic, because the momentum will be in our favor.' In any case, the IDF is preparing for all possibilities - a full or partial withdrawal - and also for the possibility of staying and resuming fighting after Phase I. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkku2bedjl	2025-01-14T21:28:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/06/SyyLDgKLkg/SyyLDgKLkg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Democratic Representative Pramila Jayapal, a prominent progressive and outspoken critic of Israel, has been appointed to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Jayapal has consistently voted against Israel, opposed sanctions on Iran and supported ending U.S. military aid to the IDF, citing alleged human rights violations. She has also faced criticism for denying reports of sexual assaults committed by Hamas during its October 7 attack. Joining Jayapal on the committee is Congresswoman Sarah McBride, the first openly transgender member of Congress, known for her strong support of Israel.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1quipedyx	2025-01-14T20:45:28-08:00	
Hamas seeks additional time to review terms of hostage deal	Hamas has requested a few additional hours to review several clauses in a proposed agreement to secure a cease-fire in Gaza and the release of hostages, before submitting its final response, Saudi television network Al Arabiya reported Wednesday morning, citing sources.

South Korean investigators arrest impeached President Yoon in ins...	South Korean authorities arrested impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday over insurrection allegations, with the embattled leader saying he agreed to comply with what he called an illegal probe to avoid 'bloodshed.' His arrest, the first ever for an incumbent South Korean president, is the latest head-spinning development for one of Asia's most vibrant democracies even though the country has a history of prosecuting and imprisoning former leaders. Since lawmakers voted to stand him down after his short-lived declaration of martial law on Dec. 3, Yoon has been holed up at his hillside residence, guarded by a small army of personal security that blocked a previous arrest attempt. A defiant Yoon said he submitted himself for questioning to avoid any violence after more than 3,000 police officers marched on his residence to arrest him from the early hours of Wednesday. 'I decided to respond to the CIO's investigation - despite it being an illegal investigation - to prevent unsavory bloodshed,' Yoon said in a statement, referring to the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) that is heading the criminal probe.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byvdy64p1x	2025-01-14T20:39:58-08:00	
We are dealing with the devil'	Col. (ret.) Amit Assa on the hostage-for-ceasefire deal: 'You can't deal with the devil if you want to kill him' Israel must approach any deal with Hamas with extreme caution because 'we are dealing with the devil,' said Col. (ret.) Amit Assa, a former member of the Israeli Security Agency. 'We have to understand that this is a terror organization.' Assa emphasized that any agreement allowing Hamas to remain in control of Gaza would be 'bad for Israel.' He explained that Israel entered this war with several objectives, including releasing the hostages and annihilating Hamas. According to Assa, these two goals are inherently at odds. 'You can't deal with the devil if you want to kill him,' Assa stated. 'These two goals are getting more and more against each other. And when we see a deal to release hostages, it means directly not achieving the other goal of defeating Hamas.' While Assa acknowledged the significance of securing the hostages' release, he pointed out the broader implications of such agreements. 'So Israel perhaps does need this hostage deal to bring about a sense of unity, of solidarity, not leaving anyone behind,' he concluded, 'but there is a cost to this deal.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by2tiivwkg	2025-01-14T18:11:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/03/SkovRIH8yx/SkovRIH8yx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Is this the breakthrough Israel's hostage families have been wait...	ILTV’s Shosh Bedrosian spoke to hostage family members and shared her insights in the studio As a hostage deal gets closer, ILTV’s Shosh Bedrosian spoke to hostage family members and shared her insights in the studio. Lidar Grave-Lazi: What does it mean to these families? Bedrosian: It's just surreal to think we're actually at this point after more than a year—way more than a year—since we saw the first agreement happen in November of 2023. For the families, hearing this news, of course, it's been a game of ping-pong. For them, they hear updates, you know, from this month, this month, and now we're finally to this point where it seems as if there's some finalization going on with this deal. I've gotten close with a few of these families. They have told me it is not a deal until they get that phone call. Specifically, one of those hostage families is the family of Omri Miran. His wife has been fighting significantly to get him back home. She told me, the minute I get that phone call is the minute I know that he is on his way back. Of course, we don't know the conditions of these hostages, so there are challenges ahead. Grave-Lazie: What do the families of the hostages want to see when it comes to a deal this time around? Bedrosian: They want to see all hostages, alive and dead, as part of this deal. Some families say all the hostages don't have to come out at once in the first phase of this deal, but they want to see a plan that includes every single hostage coming home, whether they walk out or whether they're brought back to Israel for a proper burial. Here’s what some hostage families have to say: 'We’re waiting. But me personally, I don’t believe anything until I am going to see them at the border,' said Ifat Kalderon, cousin of Israeli hostage Ofer Kalderon. 'Everybody can say whatever they want.' 'I'm hopeful that this time it's going to happen and we're going to see 98 people back home,' said Shay Dickmann, cousin of Carmel Gat, who was killed in captivity.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkp6xjvwyg	2025-01-14T17:59:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/14/ByVPfTE4vke/ByVPfTE4vke_0_5_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Pro-Palestinian group files arrest warrant against senior IDF off...	The request for the arrest warrant is against IDF Major General Ghassan Alian The Hind Rajab Foundation, a pro-Palestinian organization known for targeting IDF soldiers abroad through legal campaigns, has filed a request in Italy for an arrest warrant against IDF Major General Ghassan Alian. Alian serves as the head of the military's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) and is accused by the group of committing war crimes. The organization announced it had submitted cases to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and informed Italian authorities of Alian's presence in Rome, demanding his immediate arrest. Alian is among the most senior IDF officers targeted by the foundation to date. The group alleges that Alian oversaw the total blockade of Gaza and accuses him of 'weaponizing famine' and targeting civilian infrastructure in acts they claim amount to genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The Hind Rajab Foundation further stated that under international law, Alian has no immunity, and Italy is obligated to act swiftly. They claim that the ICC has already issued warrants for similar crimes against other Israeli officials, alleging that Alian directly supervised policies amounting to such violations. Alian, an Israeli Druze officer in the IDF, has been instrumental in overseeing the distribution of millions of tons of humanitarian aid, including food and medicine, into Gaza as head of COGAT. 'Targeting the man responsible for facilitating humanitarian aid into Gaza—it doesn’t get more ridiculous than this,' commented a senior Israeli official. This legal campaign is the latest in a series of actions aimed at Israeli military officials, further highlighting the ongoing conflict between pro-Palestinian organizations and the Israeli government.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h15s6cnvyx	2025-01-14T17:32:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/09/SyGGQbpWJx/SyGGQbpWJx_0_7_680_383_0_small.jpg
Exclusive: Mike Evans reveals Trump's expected vision for Israel ...	Donald Trump will present a new model for the Palestinians based on peace for peace, not land for peace' Incoming U.S. President Donald Trump will solve the Palestinian refugee problem, allow Israel to exert sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, and support Israel in an attack against Iran – at least according to one of his most trusted faith advisors, Mike Evans. Evans, who emphasized that he does not speak for the president—'but I know him extremely well'—will be in Israel next week to celebrate the inauguration with an event at his Friends of Zion Museum. In a phone interview, Evans told ILTV News that 'there is only one refugee crisis that has been going on for decades and decades, and that's the Palestinians. It needs to end, and I believe it will end under Donald Trump.' Evans, one of the first evangelical Christian leaders to meet with Saudi leadership about normalization with Israel years before the Abraham Accords were signed, told ILTV that more moderate Muslim countries are 'losing their tolerance for terrorism.' As such, he believes they'll back a plan to bring peace and prosperity to the region if delivered by a strong leader like Trump. Trump has already touted peace with Saudi Arabia as a key goal for his upcoming term, aiming to build on the Abraham Accords, which established peace agreements between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan. However, Saudi Arabia has recently made several statements about its expectation of a Palestinian state in exchange for peace with Israel. Israel, on the other hand, has made it clear that a Palestinian state, by full definition, would be an existential threat to its security. In February, the Knesset Plenum passed a resolution with a large majority objecting to unilateral international recognition of a Palestinian state. Then, in July, the Knesset passed a resolution altogether rejecting Palestinian statehood, even as part of a negotiated settlement. But Evans believes this is because the right deal is not yet on the table. 'Donald Trump will present a new model for the Palestinians based on peace for peace, not land for peace,' Evans said. 'Gaza needs healthcare. They need governance. You have to build everything from zero, including reeducating the people for zero tolerance for terror,' Evans explained. 'Any plan would have to last at least three to five years and be extremely detailed to change all the dynamics in Gaza. But I believe it will happen. And I believe that Trump wants autonomy for the Palestinians.' Evans said this autonomy would not constitute a state but resemble the 'Puerto Rico' model, which former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman outlined in his recently released book, One Jewish State: The Last, Best Hope to Resolve the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. In this model, Palestinians would become state citizens, receiving essential Israeli national services while maintaining municipal self-rule and empowerment. There would be no Palestinian army, just as Puerto Rico does not have an army. Citizens would not vote in national elections, similar to Puerto Ricans. 'Puerto Rico is prospering and doing fantastic,' Evans maintained. 'It will be more like the Puerto Rico model. But for that to happen, there has to be peace for peace.' He stressed that Palestinians are not inherently radical; they have become radicalized by their terror leaders. There are around 160,000 Palestinian Americans, according to the 2023 American Community Survey, and Evans said, 'They are wonderful American citizens. They are happy. They are not radical. Why? They have not been 'Islamized'. All Palestinian people deserve dignity.' Under this new model suggested by Evans, annexation of Judea and Samaria would follow. 'I believe Donald Trump will support sovereignty over Judea and Samaria,' Evans stated. He based his assumption on Trump's choice of evangelical leader and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee as U.S. ambassador to Israel. Huckabee has long supported Jewish sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, often referred to by Christians as the biblical heartland. 'Donald Trump was elected twice because of the evangelical base in America,' Evans said. 'There are 52 million Bible believers who believe this is biblical land, and they believe if you take it from Israel, you'll go back to Genesis 12:1-3.' In Genesis 12:1-3, God gives Abraham the land of Israel and says He will make the Jews a great nation. 'I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you,' the verses conclude. Evans explained that many evangelicals interpret this to mean they would be cursed if the land changed hands. To move forward, Evans stressed that Israel must finish dismantling Hamas in Gaza. He noted that Trump has warned that Hamas would have 'hell to pay' if all 98 hostages are not returned home. Current deals only work in phases and do not ensure the immediate release of all those held by Hamas. Evans said he believes Trump 'will give Israel enormous support to finish the job in Gaza. There won't be anything holding them back.' Similarly, Evans believes Trump will support Israel in an attack against Iran. Because Trump 'is an antiwar president,' Evans said he does not believe the U.S. will take part in the attack or enter Iran. 'But he will provide everything conceivable for the State of Israel to do the job and finish it with Iran.' 'Iran is the ground zero for all Mideast terror,' Evans continued. 'Israel will have a blank check from Donald Trump to end it.' Despite Trump's sometimes unpredictable nature, Evans said that when it comes to terrorists, 'it is simply a case of good and evil, and he considers the terrorists evil.' Evans has maintained a close relationship with Trump over the past four years and with several members of his previous cabinet. The event he is holding with ILTV News at the museum on January 20 will celebrate the inauguration and bring together key thought leaders to discuss what they believe will be the incoming president's first steps. In preparation for the event, Evans launched a new campaign featuring giant billboards across Israel congratulating President Donald Trump on the start of his term as President of the United States. The message on the billboards reads: 'Congratulations Donald Trump. Israel loves you.' Evans ran a similar campaign in November 2024 when Trump was elected president, reaching audiences worldwide. Another significant campaign took place in May 2017 during Trump’s visit to Jerusalem, featuring 220 billboards across Israel. 'Donald Trump is the same Donald Trump' who supported Israel in his first term, Evans stressed. 'I believe the future for Israel over the next four years will be bright.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ierynvje	2025-01-14T16:43:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/15/SkGmg9EvJe/SkGmg9EvJe_0_20_850_479_0_small.jpg

The phases, the numbers and the conditions | This is the emerging...	Some 33 hostages, including the two Bibas children, are expected to be released in the first phase of the cease-fire deal, which will last 42 days - while Israel will release about 1,300 terrorists; The IDF is expected to remain on the Philadelphi Corridor and withdraw in phases to a buffer zone; In addition, the IDF is expected to leave the Netzarim Corridor and displaced persons will be able to return to the northern Gaza Strip Amid the exchange of accusations between Israel and Hamas regarding the delays in the emerging hostage deal, feverish talks to advance the agreement continue Tuesday night. In an effort to reach the finish line, the negotiations are expected to extend well into the night. The emerging outline consists of several stages, and includes a cease-fire, the release of hostages in phases, and also changes in the deployment of IDF forces in the Gaza Strip. The negotiations, which have been going on for many weeks, are being conducted under complete secrecy, among other things to prevent political pressure; but in recent days, apparently due to the narrowing of the gaps between the parties, many reports have begun to surface regarding their details. According to the outline, in the first stage, 33 hostages will be released. The list that Israel passed to Hamas included 34 hostages, hostage Youssef Ziyadne, whose body was recovered by IDF soldiers from the Gaza Strip last week, was removed from it. According to Israeli estimates, most of the hostages on the list are alive - but there is no complete certainty about this. Israel has effectively given up its demand to receive a list of live hostages - and continues to move forward with a deal without it. In the first phase of the deal, the women and the Bibas children are expected to be released. After that, female soldiers will be released, then adults over the age of 50, and those who have been defined as wounded and sick. The release is supposed to last throughout the entire first phase - over 42 days. On the 16th day of the first phase, discussions will begin on implementing the second phase of the deal. The agreement is divided into three phases, and on Monday night political sources said it may be reduced to two. During the second phase, the rest of the live hostages are supposed to be released from captivity, possibly along with the dead. After the first phase, 65 hostages are still expected to remain in Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip. Among the hostages are 36 who are defined as dead, 7 foreigners, and 22 Israeli hostages who are defined as alive. After the announcement of agreement, the deal will be submitted for approval to the Political-Security Cabinet and the government. After that, the government secretariat will publish the list of Palestinian prisoners who will be released, and the public will be given time to submit petitions against the releases to the High Court. The law states that the public will be given at least 48 hours before the implementation. The deal is expected to have majority approval in the government. In the first phase of the agreement, approximately 1,300 terrorists are expected to be released. However, since Israel does not know which of the hostages released in the first phase is alive, it is not certain that all 1,300 terrorists will be released, and the numbers could change depending on the fate of the hostages released in the first phase. Israel is demanding that terrorists with blood on their hands be exiled and not allowed to return to the West Bank, meaning that they will be exiled to the Gaza Strip, Qatar or Turkey. In the first stage, the Nukhba terrorists who were captured in Gaza will not be released. According to a Saudi report, which has not been verified by any other source, Hamas also demanded the release of the body of the terrorist organization's leader, Yahya Sinwar. A political source responded that: 'That won't happen, period.' In terms of the IDF's presence on the ground, the forces are expected to remain on the Philadelphi Corridor in the first phase, and withdraw in phases to a buffer zone to ensure that Hamas implements the deal. The IDF is supposed to leave the area of the Netzarim Corridor, which effectively separates the northern Gaza Strip from the south, and this will allow displaced Gaza residents to return to the northern Gaza Strip after undergoing security checks - the nature of which was not specified. The families of the hostages received an update from the Hostages Directorate Tuesday evening, which stated that, throughout the last few hours, consultations, situation assessments and integrative staff work required by the state for the negotiations have continued at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem. Meanwhile, a situation assessment was held by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his team with Defense Minister Israel Katz, the heads of the defense establishment, and the negotiating team in Doha. 'The negotiations are intensive, discussing details that require a conclusion, and are continuing and will continue tonight,' the Prime Minister's Office said. Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fox claimed Tuesday evening that the current deal 'is the same deal as May 27.' 'I was there in all the forums that discussed the deal,' he said. 'The current deal was rejected by Hamas for six months and even now it has not yet been approved by them. During all this time, if a positive answer had come from Hamas, it would have had a majority in the cabinet and the government. The Prime Minister did not change his position one millimeter. The only factor that thwarted the deal - Hamas.' Fear of hostage families: The second phase will not materialize In the shadow of the expectation for the return of 33 hostages in the first phase, families of hostages who are not included in the list fear that the second phase will not be implemented. On the surface, and although much remains to be seen regarding the details of the outline, it is already clear that throughout the first phase the IDF will remain in the buffer zone in the Gaza Strip, will hold positions on the Philadelphi Corridor and will evacuate the Netzarim Corridor, only while implementing a screening mechanism for Gazans who wish to return to the northern Gaza Strip. Alongside this, it is clear that the phase also includes comprehensive and extensive humanitarian assistance. However, the second phase , which includes the end of the war, effectively marks the beginning of the 'day after' in the Gaza Strip - and therefore the list of demands that Hamas has presented in the past regarding it has repeatedly crossed all of Israel's red lines. The terrorist organization's main demand, in order to agree to the release of the 65 Israeli and foreign hostages, which are its last bargaining chip, is to end the war. This is a complete end, a 'sustainable peace' without reservations, within the framework of which Israel will fully withdraw from the Gaza Strip and allow billions of dollars from other countries to be poured into its reconstruction. In addition, Hamas is expected to demand the release of a larger number of prisoners for each soldier not included in the outline in the first phase - while it also defines the young men as 'soldiers.' The terrorist organization, which wants to present some kind of achievement for the murderous surprise attack it carried out and which also brought disaster to the Gaza Strip, is also expected to demand that Israel release more 'heavyweight' prisoners in the second phase, including, for example, Palestinian leaders such as Marwan Barghouti, or Hassan Salameh - a friend of Muhammad Sinwar and a senior member of Hamas' military wing, who is serving 46 life sentences. To this must be added another problem of the second phase, which will probably emerge in the first phase: The terrorist organization is conducting the negotiations in a cynical and cruel manner and, as was the case in the previous deal, it is expected to try to introduce 'scapegoats' during the implementation of the agreement. These could present decision-makers in Israel with unbearable dilemmas, and create a dynamic of distrust that will blow up the talks. > Israel prepared for this in advance, and therefore during the first phase it will retain significant leverage over Hamas – such as remaining in the buffer zone in the Gaza Strip and in Philadelphi, but in the second phase these leverages will slowly fade, and in order for all the hostages to be released during this process it is necessary to ensure that Hamas has something to lose. Such a situation can be created, for example, through the third phase, which has already been discussed – and which guarantees the full rehabilitation of the Gaza Strip only after the release of the last hostage. One of the main difficulties the mediators encountered Is the goal declared by each side - which means that the outline for ending the war must allow both Israel and Hamas to declare 'victory.' In other words, if the unexpected does not happen, and Hamas does not back down from its demand to end the war, the question arises of what guarantees Israel will receive that the terrorist organization will indeed not take an active part in governing Gaza. In addition, Israel's security demands must also be met: From the government's perspective, the war must end with no fighting force in the Gaza Strip that poses a threat.

This is how Israel has prepared for return of hostages from Gaza,...	Israeli authorities already briefed social workers on the support process, with special emphasis on addressing sexual assault cases; Health Ministry will focus on psychological care, while Justice Ministry will handle prisoner releases and petitions to High Cour to stop them, while Israel Prison Service will prevent victory displays such as those seen during the 2011 Shalit deal Since the reports emerged regarding the progress of negotiations for a hostage deal, all relevant authorities have been preparing for the potential return of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza for the last 466 days. The Welfare and Social Affairs Ministry has been conducting repeated briefings for social workers to prepare them for the reception and support of the hostages upon their return. These briefings were held even though no official instructions have been received from the Hostage Administration or the Prime Minister’s Office. Should the deal come to fruition, security forces will be the first to receive the hostages and provide them with initial physical and psychological assistance. They will then be transferred to hospitals, where social workers from the Health Ministry and the hospitals will offer further support. In addition to medical examinations, the returning hostages will begin a gradual process of coping with their prolonged captivity under Hamas. They will receive professional help tailored to their individual needs, depending on their condition and willingness to share their experiences. Upon returning home, each released hostage will be assigned a social worker who will address all their needs and assist in their rehabilitation. Social workers already know who they will be supporting, and they have detailed files about the hostages, including information on where they were abducted from, whether they lost close relatives, and their backgrounds prior to the October 7 massacre. According to officials, social workers have also been briefed on how to address possible cases of sexual assault during captivity. There is also an understanding that the mental health of the hostages expected to be released will be significantly more challenging than those who returned after 50 days of captivity in the previous deal in November 2023. > The Welfare and Social Affairs Ministry emphasized that 'we see the care and rehabilitation of the hostages and their families as a national mission and a professional commitment of the highest priority, and we have been preparing over the past year for their return, relying on the accumulated experience from previous hostage receptions. Our professional teams, including social workers and treatment personnel, are ready to ensure the best possible support. Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of the Public Health Division at the Health Ministry, told Ynet that the health system has learned a great deal from previous hostage releases. 'We must understand that the conditions here are truly different. People are arriving after over a year in captivity, and it’s a completely different world. But the lessons learned from the previous reception process will serve us.' 'The Ministry of Health led the effort to receive the injured at hospitals during the previous round, and we learned a lot from that,' she added. 'It’s important to see what other health or welfare issues arise over time, as not everything surfaces in the first days of hospitalization, so long-term follow-up is also crucial. We are preparing.' Regarding what has been learned from previous release rounds, the senior official in the Health Ministry stated: 'It’s important to ensure they are surrounded, to protect them from the media, from all kinds of curious individuals who want to talk. They need privacy. We must also make space for their families and those they want to be with. Additionally, there must be room for necessary medical tests to ensure proper health checks such as vitamins, minerals, and any nutritional deficiencies. We need to monitor and understand what needs to be tracked.' Preparing for opposition to releasing terrorists Meanwhile, the State Attorney’s Office is preparing draft responses for potential petitions to the High Court of Justice, anticipating legal challenges to prevent the release of terrorists. The Pardon Department of the Justice Ministry is completing the necessary forms and requests for clemency for the security prisoners. This is all being done to ensure the swift completion of the deal with Hamas. Accordingly, officials from the Attorney General’s office are expected to reach out to families affected by terrorist attacks – victims of terrorist organizations – to allow them to pursue legal appeals if they wish to challenge the release of a particular terrorist who harmed them. Senior legal sources indicate that the deal with Hamas is expected to be approved by the High Court of Justice quickly, likely without delving into the specifics of individual cases. Instead, the Court will likely rule that such decisions are 'non-justiciable,' meaning they involve supreme political and security considerations where the court refrains from intervening. Officials from the Pardon Department, the High Court Division, the Israel Prison Service (IPS), the Military Prosecution, and other security bodies have already started meeting to implement the expected government decision on the prisoner release framework. Once the deal is signed, a 'release order' will be prepared for each prisoner. The Justice Ministry is preparing to publish the names of the released prisoners on its website to allow families of the victims 48 hours to file an appeal. Prisoners sentenced by civilian courts will receive a pardon from the government and the President. 'There's no going back to the Shalit Deal' Alongside the preparations for receiving the hostages, the Israel Prison Service (IPS) is preparing for the transfer of security prisoners expected to be released from Israeli prisons as part of the deal. IPS Commissioner Kobi Yaakobi recently instructed to step up preparations for this operation. The list of released prisoners will be made public only after the deal is signed. It is already clear that some of the prisoners to be released will be those convicted of severe offenses and sentenced to multiple life terms. Based on lessons from the past, the IPS has decided that prisoners will not be allowed to extend their hands during the transfer in buses, aiming to prevent scenes like those that remain burned in the public memory from the 2011 deal to recover IDF soldier Gilad Shalit, when several released prisoners made victory signs. The current plan is that the prisoners will be transferred in buses with tinted windows or without upper windows. 'The victory signs from the buses during the previous prisoner release 14 years ago will not happen again,' according to an IPS official. The preparations also include security for the transportation of prisoners in armored convoys from various prisons across the country to the Ofer facility, where the release will take place. IPS special units, including the Masada unit and other security teams, will be part of the security operation. Furthermore, the IPS is preparing to receive prisoners currently under the control of the IDF and transfer them to its custody until their release. Another key concern is preventing the newly released prisoners from sending messages to their fellow inmates who will not be released. Israel Prison Service Chief Commissioner Kobi Yaakobi expressed concern over the possibility of riots in prisons after the deal is completed. The fear is that prisoners who are not included in the release lists may feel they have nothing to lose and could challenge the system, attempting to disrupt order in the prisons. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjgpmrnwjx	2025-01-14T12:28:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/24/rJipur0E6/rJipur0E6_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

IDF launches airstrike on Jenin in West Bank	An Israeli Air Force aircraft attacked the terrorist stronghold, a month after Palestinian security forces launched an operation against Islamic Jihad there. In a joint operation, an Israeli Air Force aircraft attacked the Palestinian city of Jenin in the West Bank on Tuesday night, the IDF and Shin Bet spokespeople announced. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, five people were killed and two were injured in the attack. In December, Palestinian Authority security forces launched an operation against members of the Jenin Brigade, affiliated with Islamic Jihad. The operation was somewhat successful, and its members arrested more than 280 terrorists accused of shooting at Palestinian forces, possessing and trafficking weapons, and colluding with hostile foreign elements who financed them. > This week, Palestinian Authority security forces spokesman Anwar Rajab announced at a special press conference held in the Jenin municipality, the arrest of 'outlaws' affiliated with the Jenin Brigade, including suspects who received funds from Iran. However, the security forces are having difficulty gaining the trust of the residents of Jenin and the nearby refugee camp, who have complained about the conditions and the 'siege,' as they put it, imposed by the PA security forces. At the same time, Israel did not shower much praise on the activities of the security forces, and an Israeli security source told Reuters news agency that 'they have a great desire to carry out security operations - but their capabilities are poor.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjgg0s4d1x	2025-01-14T12:04:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/14/rJeNBnBEPJe/rJeNBnBEPJe_0_311_474_267_0_small.jpg
Biden to lift U.S. designation of Cuba as state sponsor of terror...	U.S. President Joe Biden will relax sanctions targeting long-time foe Cuba days before Donald Trump takes office in a broad set of steps on Tuesday that he expects to lead to release of political prisoners in Havana. As part of the steps, Biden is reversing several hardline restrictions put in place by Trump, his predecessor and the president-elect. Those steps include notifying Congress of plans to lift the U.S. designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism and undoing a Trump order that had restricted some financial transactions with some military and government-tied Cubans, according to a senior administration official. Biden was also set to suspend the ability of individuals to use U.S. courts to make claims for potentially confiscated property in Cuba following Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, the official said. The steps were connected to the expected release by Cuba of a 'significant' number of political prisoners, following the communist-run government's talks with the Catholic Church.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkvxqh4djg	2025-01-14T11:04:38-08:00	
Putin has the momentum, Ukraine feels the pressure ahead of Trump...	Tactically pushed back and strategically defeated: With Trump's return to the White House, Kyiv braces for a shift that may work against it; Putin is already preparing for a meeting with Trump, and it’s unclear whether he has any interest in ending the war with the president-elect on his side Less than a week before President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House, and amid reports from both sides that efforts are underway to organize a summit between Trump and Vladimir Putin in the coming weeks, uncertainty looms over Ukraine due to the complex and challenging situation on the frontlines of the war. Currently, Russian forces control more than 18% of Ukraine’s sovereign territory, including Crimea. Russian military units continue to make consistent advances in eastern Ukraine, particularly in the western Donetsk region, capitalizing on the Ukrainian army’s severe shortage of personnel, particularly experienced fighters, and its struggle to defend a long front line. For some time now, Ukrainians have grown increasingly doubtful of their ability to reclaim territories occupied by Russia. Kyiv also fears that Russian forces may expand their occupied areas, especially as the expected Trump administration seeks to bring an end to the war or freeze the conflict. Recently, Russian forces have advanced south of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, an important logistical and transportation hub, and appear to be attempting to encircle it. Russian advances have also been reported in the Luhansk region. Despite pressure from the Washington administration, Ukraine continues to refuse to draft young men aged 18 to 25 into the military. Currently, men between the ages of 25 and 60 are being recruited, with many of the soldiers over the age of 43, highlighting the severe shortage of experienced fighters. > While awaiting Trump’s return to the White House and the possibility of negotiations to end the war, Ukrainians are working to increase international support. On Friday, a regular meeting of NATO defense ministers took place at the Ramstein base in Germany, which is used by both NATO and the U.S. Air Force. Ukraine is not a member of the military alliance, but President Volodymyr Zelensky attended the gathering. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov also attended, stating that Ukraine's priorities for 2025 will be stabilizing the frontlines and strengthening defense capabilities. In addition to the Biden administration’s announcement of an additional $500 million in military aid to Ukraine, other nations in the forum pledged to continue providing military support, including air defense systems and drones. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin emphasized that the coalition supporting Kyiv throughout the war 'must continue to stand by Ukraine and strengthen its position for the eventual possibility of negotiations that will, at some point, bring an end to Putin’s monstrous war.' It is still unclear whether the forum will continue to meet after Trump is inaugurated on January 20, and a new administration takes office in the U.S. Retired General Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy on Ukraine, said in a television interview last week that: 'People need to understand, Trump is not trying to give anything to Putin or the Russians. He is trying to preserve Ukraine’s sovereignty and ensure it, and he will do so fairly and honestly.' Kellogg also stated that Trump intends to try to end the war within 100 days of entering the White House. This declaration sounds very optimistic, perhaps overly so, given the vast differences between the two sides. At this point, it’s unclear whether Putin, who currently has the momentum on his side, has any real interest in ending the fighting, especially if he believes that Trump will significantly reduce U.S. aid to Ukraine. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skl1qn4vkx	2025-01-14T10:52:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/07/H1BPotqZyg/H1BPotqZyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
French Socialist Party raises threat of backing no-confidence vot...	The French Socialist Party, whose support Francois Bayrou's minority government has been trying to secure for weeks, on Tuesday raised the threat of backing a no-confidence vote against the government later this week. The Socialists, who voted down previous budget proposals in December in conjunction with far-right lawmakers and thereby precipitated the fall of Michel Barnier's government, have made concessions on the 2023 pension reform a condition for support. Earlier in the day, during a speech to Parliament, Bayrou opened the door to renegotiating the disputed pension reform but Faure said this was not good enough. 'We will back a no-confidence vote, unless we get a clear response to our demands,' Faure told the TF1 evening news bulletin on Tuesday.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sybnsevdkl	2025-01-14T10:30:35-08:00

Kill every last member of Hamas': Trump defense secretary nomine...	Pete Hegseth, a Fox News anchor with no political experience, will soon be in charge of the Pentagon; In a Senate hearing, Hegseth sided with Israel, saying: 'I robustly support the state of Israel and its existential defense' Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of Defense, arrived for a Senate hearing Tuesday. Members of Trump's future Cabinet are required to attend a hearing and answer questions from lawmakers, who are then expected to vote on and formally confirm the appointment. Hegseth's hearingbefore the Senate Foreign Relations and National Security Committee was stormy and lasted hours. It dealt with controversies surrounding the politically inexperienced Hegseth, including his drinking habits and his relationship with women in the shadow of a complaint of sexual assault. Hegseth, a former Fox News anchor, is said to have been chosen as Trump's nominee because the president-elect liked his television appearances. He responded to most questions at the hearing with attacks on the 'leftist' media, or with religious-sounding answers such as: 'I failed at many things in my life, and Jesus saved me.' Trump's nominee for Secretary of Defense is 44 and a former captain in the U.S. National Guard. He has extensive combat experience, and served in Afghanistan and Iraq, and other places. Hegseth became friends with Trump during the years he worked at Fox News, when hosted him on his show. The choice of the inexperienced Hegseth stunned not only the Pentagon, but also Trump's advisers. Quite a few Republicans reacted rather coolly to the choice of someone who had combat experience in the field, but not in government management, certainly not a huge department like the Department of Defense. Hegseth is known for his staunch opposition to women serving in combat, and has previously accused the U.S. military of lowering standards to allow women to join combat units. In a recent book, Hegseth railed against initiatives in the military designed to make it more diverse and equal. The defense secretary-designate also questioned whether U.S. Chief of Staff Charles Brown was chosen for the position because he is black. 'I don't believe you are qualified for the position,' Democratic Senator Jack Reid, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and National Security Committee, told Hegseth. At the Senate hearing, Hegseth said he would consider removing women from combat roles, and would also change the military's policy on combating climate change. He avoided committing to resigning if he were caught drunk while serving as defense secretary, and did not answer the question of whether he would follow Trump's order to shoot protesters in the legs. During the hearing, Hegseth was asked if he defined himself as a Christian-Zionist, and he replied: ''I am a Christian and I robustly support the state of Israel and its existential defense and the way America comes alongside them as their great ally.' He also said that 'I support Israel in destroying and killing every last member of Hamas.' He added that the United States should distance itself from 'the complications of the Middle East' and concentrate on 'the threats coming from China and the Indo-Pacific region.' The committee, which has a Republican majority, will next vote on whether to forward Hegseth's nomination to a vote of the entire Senate. > Trump himself, who has been following the hearing with incessant social media posts, will become the 47th president of the United States on Monday afternoon. Unlike his term as the 45th president, this time when he takes office the U.S. system of checks and balances will not hinder him since both the House of Representatives and the Senate have Republican majorities. Trump promises to sign hundreds of executive orders on his first day in office and launch his promised campaign of revenge. According to a report by the Associated Press, senior officials in the incoming administration have already begun investigating long-time civil servants on the White House National Security Council. They are checking who these people voted for in the last election and whether they posted on social media against Trump. At least some of those employees have already started packing their belongings, after receiving indications that they will not remain employed in the new administration. Meanwhile, the office of former first lady Michelle Obama announced that she does not plan to attend the ceremony where Trump will replace Joe Biden. Husband Barack Obama will attend the ceremony, as will former presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton, accompanied by their wives. Elon Musk -Trump's close associate, who will hold an official position in the incoming administration, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos will sit on the main stage at the ceremony. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skbm3xnpyx	2025-01-14T10:02:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/14/BJ94qf7NP1g/BJ94qf7NP1g_0_136_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Nawaf Salam, who has been designated as the new Prime Minister of Lebanon, has resigned as a member of the International Court of Justice, said the ICJ on Tuesday. Salam's term as head of the ICJ had been due to end in early February 2027. Earlier this week, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun summoned Salam to designate him prime minister after most lawmakers had nominated him, dealing a big blow to Hezbollah, which accused opponents of seeking to exclude it.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syxlcxvdkx	2025-01-14T09:35:22-08:00

Representatives for the company executives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Both my hands are extended to everyone,' Lebanon's PM-designate ...	Nawaf Salam, who has been serving as presiding judge at the International Court of Justice,, reaches out to Hezbollah, says time for 'a new chapter' in Lebanon 'rooted in justice, security, progress and opportunities'; But possible sectarian rift could ruin everything Lebanon's Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam said on Tuesday his hands were 'extended to everyone,' in a gesture to Iran-backed Hezbollah, that accused opponents of seeking to exclude it by nominating him for the post. President Joseph Aoun formally designated Salam, who has been serving as presiding judge at the International Court of Justice, to form the next government on Tuesday, after he won the backing of a majority of lawmakers the previous day. Salam's nomination has reflected a dramatic shift in the power balance in Lebanon, a result of the heavy blows dealt to Hezbollah in last year's war with Israel, compounded by the ousting last month of its Syrian ally Bashar Assad. It follows last week's election of Aoun, the former head of the Lebanese army who has U.S. and Saudi support. Speaking after the meeting, Salam said he was committed to rebuilding from last year's war between Israel and Hezbollah, and that it was time for 'a new chapter' in Lebanon 'rooted in justice, security, progress and opportunities.' Reconstruction 'requires the full implementation of (U.N.) Resolution 1701 and all provisions of the cease-fire agreement and the imposition of the enemy’s complete withdrawal from the last occupied inch of our lands', he said, referring to Israel. Hezbollah had wanted outgoing Prime Minister Najib Mikati to keep the job, and believed this had been secured under the terms of a political understanding by which its lawmakers endorsed Aoun as president last week, Hezbollah sources say. But Salam emerged with the endorsement of 84 out of parliament's 128 lawmakers, among them Christians, Druze and Sunni Muslim MPs, including both Hezbollah allies and opponents. Another sectarian rift possible Hezbollah and the allied Shi'ite Amal Movement, which together hold all seats in parliament reserved for Shi'ite Muslims, endorsed nobody, and have indicated they do not intend to join Salam's government. This raises the prospect of a fresh sectarian rift - unless he can convince them otherwise. Salam said he supported unity and was against exclusion. 'This is my sincere call and both my hands are extended to everyone,' he said. Aoun, in comments published on the presidency's X feed, said Salam's nomination was 'a democratic process' while appearing to acknowledge Hezbollah's concern, saying that 'if one group is broken, all of Lebanon is broken.' Hezbollah had long held decisive sway over such appointments, its role underpinned by the powerful arsenal which critics say has undermined the state and unilaterally dragged Lebanon into regional wars. Under Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system, the presidency goes to a Maronite Christian, the prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim, and the speaker of parliament must be a Shi'ite. > Salam said he would work for justice for victims of the 2020 Beirut port explosion. No senior official has been held to account for the blast, which killed at least 220 people and arose from the detonation of hundreds of tonnes of ammonium nitrate. He also said he would work for justice for depositors whose savings have been frozen inside the Lebanese financial system since it collapsed in 2019, the result of decades of corruption and waste by the ruling elite. 'We have wasted many opportunities to build the state. Enough wasted opportunities,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1iicmndyg	2025-01-14T08:39:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/13/ByplcCGwke/ByplcCGwke_0_135_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

US designates extreme right-wing 'Terrorgram' network as terroris...	The U.S. imposed sanctions on an extreme right-wing online network, designating the 'Terrorgram' collective a terrorist group and accusing it of promoting violent white supremacy. The U.S. State Department said in a statement that it had designated the group, which primarily operates on the Telegram social media site, and three of its leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists. The State Department said the group has motivated and facilitated attacks and attempted attacks by users, including a 2022 shooting outside an LGBTQ bar in Slovakia, a planned attack in 2024 on energy facilities in New Jersey and an August knife attack at a mosque in Turkey. The action freezes any of the group's U.S. assets and bars Americans from dealing with it. The leaders targeted on Monday with sanctions were based in Brazil, Croatia and South Africa, according to the statement. Telegram in a statement on Tuesday said: 'Calls to violence have no place on Telegram's platform. Telegram's Moderators removed several channels that used variations of the 'Terrorgram' name when they were discovered years ago. Similar content is banned whenever it appears.' In September, U.S. prosecutors unveiled criminal charges against two alleged leaders of 'Terrorgram', saying they used Telegram to solicit attacks on Black, Jewish, LGBTQ people and immigrants with the aim of inciting a race war.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rylh5mewyg	2025-01-14T08:12:28-08:00

Trump says will create 'External Revenue Service' to collect from...	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Tuesday he will create a new department called the External Revenue Service 'to collect tariffs, duties, and all revenue' from foreign sources. Trump said in a social media post he would create the department on Jan. 20, the day he will be inaugurated as president for a second term. 'Through soft and pathetically weak trade agreements, the American economy has delivered growth and prosperity to the World, while taxing ourselves. It is time for that to change,' the Republican said in a post on Truth Social. 'We will begin charging those that make money off of us with trade, and they will start paying, FINALLY, their fair share.' Trump has pledged to impose big tariffs on the United States' three largest trading partners - Canada, Mexico and China - including a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico until they clamped down on drugs and migrants crossing the border. He has also vowed impose tariffs of 10% on global imports into the United States, along with a 60% tariff on Chinese goods - duties that trade experts say would upend trade flows, raise costs and draw retaliation against U.S. exports.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjfg5fvpyg	2025-01-14T08:09:54-08:00	
Blinken says deal closer than ever, ball in Hamas' court as prepa...	U.S. secretary of state says if Hamas accepts the deal it is ready to be implemented, and he believes a cease-fire will be reached; Meanwhile, Islamic Jihad delegation arriving in Doha, and Saudi report says Red Cross preparing for transfer U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday said that negotiators were on the brink of an agreement on a Gaza cease-fire and hostage deal, adding that parties are awaiting final word from Hamas. 'It's right on the brink. It's closer than it's ever been before. But, right now, as we sit here, we await final word from Hamas on its acceptance, and until we get that word, we'll remain on the brink,' Blinken said during an event at the Atlantic Council. 'The ball is now in Hamas’ court. If Hamas accepts, the deal is ready to be concluded and implement it. I believe we will get a ceasefire. Whether we get there in the remaining days of our administration, or after January 20, the deal will follow closely the terms of the agreement that President Biden put forward last May and that our administration rallied the world behind,' he said. Blinken added that post-war Gaza should be under the control of the Palestinian Authority but with interim roles for foreign players and the United Nations. 'We believe that the Palestinian Authority should invite international partners to help establish and run an interim administration with responsibility for key civil sectors in Gaza,' Blinken said, revealing a long-awaited plan for post-war Gaza as his term ends. 'You have to look at what would be enduring and what would make sure that the program doesn’t come back. So one of the things you have to assess is: If that were to happen, would Iran simply rebuild and rebuild even deeper underground in a place that would be even harder to get to?' Blinken responds. Blinken also criticized both the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority. 'Israelis must abandon the myth that they can carry out de facto annexation without cost and consequence to Israel’s democracy, to its standing, and to its security,' he said. He pointed to rapid settlement expansion, stating that 'Israel is expanding official settlements and nationalizing land at a faster clip than any time in the last decade while turning a blind eye to unprecedented growth in illegal outposts.' Blinken also expressed concern over rising settler violence, adding: 'Violent attacks by extremist settlers against Palestinian civilians have reached record levels.' The Americans are very active in behind-the-scenes negotiations, and are supporting the talks with a strong presence that includes the CIA team, Biden's envoy Brett McGurk, and Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff. Meanwhile, Islamic Jihad, which is also holding hostages, announced that a senior delegation from the organization would arrive in Doha Tuesday night to participate in the talks on the hostage deal. The Saudi television channel Al-Hadath reported Tuesday evening, citing sources, that in the Gaza Strip, 'hostage-takers have begun to be transferred to safe places in preparation for the implementation of the agreement.' It was also reported that 'Hamas has begun dividing the hostages into groups in preparation for their release.' In addition, the report said, 'some disputes between Israel and Hamas have been resolved, and Israel has agreed to the request not to re-arrest prisoners after their release. In addition, an agreement was reached to stop all future attacks on Hamas leaders.' The Qatari channel Al-Arabi reported, citing Egyptian sources, that 'the authorities responsible for operating the Rafah crossing have received official notices calling on them to prepare for its opening within days.' According to the report, 'Israel will evacuate the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing when the cease-fire agreement comes into effect.' > The Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed noted, citing Palestinian sources, that the IDF had begun dismantling infrastructure it had built on the Netzarim Corridor in preparation for the hostage deal. According to the report, 'local eyewitnesses in Gaza said that military transport vehicles entered the Netzarim Corridor, one of the important strategic points in the Strip, and began the process of dismantling military towers in the west of the corridor.' The Saudi television network Al-Arabiya added that 'coordination has begun with intermediaries and the Red Cross regarding the transfer of the hostages.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1rpwznv1x	2025-01-14T08:07:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/08/19/S1kqhlbj0/S1kqhlbj0_0_0_565_310_0_small.jpg

Supreme Court rejects Palestinian Authority appeal to overturn te...	Court ruled that PA directly finances terrorism through payments to terrorists and their families and, therefore, overturns claim the law intends to bring about the PA's economic collapse After the Palestinian Authority petitioned the Supreme Court last year and requested to overturn a law which allows victims of terrorism to demand compensation from the entity that finances it, Supreme Court Justice and Acting President Isaac Amit rejected the PA's petition on Monday. Amit ruled that 'we will begin and say what is absent from the petition but deserves to be said: The Palestinian Authority pays terrorists and members of their families significant amounts of money and benefits, in close connection with the criminal acts of terrorism they committed.' Amit also ruled that 'even if the law is based on a political motive, this does not lead to its repeal.' Justice Khaled Kabub and Justice Yael Wilner also joined Amit in the decision. In May, the Palestinian Authority petitioned the Supreme Court to strike down the Compensation for Terror Victims Law (Exemplary Damages), enacted in 2024 by the Knesset. The law establishes entitlement to compensation in tort claims filed against a perpetrator of a terrorist act, a person determined to be liable for an act of terrorism, or an entity that supports the perpetrator. The law states that if the act of terrorism caused the death of a person, his heirs will be entitled to compensation. It was also determined that the compensation will be paid in addition to any other compensation awarded in a tort claim filed due to the same act, and that the damages will not be deducted from any amount paid by the state or one of its institutions to the injured party or his next of kin. According to the Palestinian Authority, the laws should be scrapped due to their 'inappropriate purpose and the disproportionate harm to the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian residents,' in violation of Israel's obligations under international law. It was claimed that another hidden purpose is to bring the Palestinian Authority to economic collapse 'and to undermine its sovereignty in order to complete the annexation of the West Bank to Israeli territory.' According to the PA, there are approximately 180 claims pending against it for compensation for acts of terrorism. The PA further argued that the Knesset does not have the authority to enact a law intended to apply extraterritorially to the assets of another sovereign, and that the laws violate basic legal rules and change the law of torts. Amit rejected the PA's petition and cited in the ruling a quote from his ruling in an earlier case, where he noted that 'the PA's compensation policy is disgusting. It is intolerable. The heart shrinks and rejects it. The eye feels its sting strongly. The metaphorical sting of the eye joins the pain and anguish of the heart and soul of the families of the victims of terrorist attacks and we cannot list them because they are many.' The ruling shows that the Palestinian Authority's payments to terrorists and members of their families amount to hundreds of millions of shekels each year. 'The reason why the law applies to the Palestinian Authority and defines it as a 'terrorist rewarder' lies in its own actions and its policy of paying salaries and benefits to terrorists and members of terrorist families,' Amit stated. 'In enacting the laws before us, the legislator sought to deter those involved in committing terrorist acts and those who approve of these acts, and to establish arrangements that benefit their victims. It would have been better if the need for their enactment had not arisen in the first place, but unfortunately this is not the case. For a number of reasons, we found that there is no constitutional basis for interfering with the law challenged in the petition, even though they deviate from the normal tort laws,' he added. Amit further ruled that the PA 'claims a violation of its rights, but the alleged violation stems from its actions and its choice to pay money and benefits to murderers stained with the blood of innocent Israelis. The Palestinian Authority has the option of choosing a different path and to cease its policy that rewards and encourages carrying out terrorist acts.' Compensation does not depend on disability The law stipulates that the heirs of a person killed as a result of an act of terrorism will be entitled to 10 million shekels, while a person injured by an act of terrorism and permanently disabled will be entitled to 5 million shekels. This means that the punitive compensation that can be awarded for a single event will reach tens of millions of shekels. The PA pointed out that there are approximately 180 lawsuits pending against it, in which hundreds of injured parties are suing, so that the amount of liability that could be imposed on it could reach billions of shekels. Imposing these amounts on the Palestinian Authority carries with it political and security implications. It is not without reason that different positions were heard during the legislative process regarding certain aspects of the law. Compensation also established at a uniform level of 5 million shekels, regardless of the degree of disability, contradicts the basic principles of tort law, but in the constitutional context this is not a reason to repeal this part of the law. > Attorney Dr. Asaf Posner, who represented the families of the victims in the proceedings demanding compensation, noted that 'the Supreme Court's decision should put an end to the claims of the Palestinian Authority, which is trying to evade providing compensation for criminal acts of terrorism. The plaintiffs say they hope that the state will quickly transfer funds to the victims who have already succeeded in their claims.

ICC prosecutor tells court to reject Israeli appeal on Gaza war p...	After Israel suggests conflict of interest by Karim Khan, the ICC prosecutor responds to the Israeli objections to the investigation into the 13-month war in Gaza, advising the judges to reject the claims The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor has told judges that Israeli objections to the investigation into the 13-month war in Gaza should be rejected. Karim Khan submitted his formal response late Monday to an appeal by Israel over The Hague-based court's jurisdiction after judges issued arrest warrants last year for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister, and Hamas' military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity in connection with the war in Gaza. The embattled Israeli leader, who is also facing corruption charges in his home country, called the arrest warrant 'a black day in the history of nations' and vowed to fight the allegations. Individuals cannot contest an arrest warrant directly, but the state of Israel can object to the entire investigation. Israel argued in a December filing that it could look into allegations against its leaders on its own and that continuing to investigate Israelis was a violation of state sovereignty. The ICC was established in 2002 as the permanent court of last resort to prosecute individuals responsible for the world's most heinous atrocities: war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and crimes of aggression. The court's 125 member states include Palestine, Ukraine, Canada and every country in the European Union, but dozens of countries don't accept the court's jurisdiction, including Israel, the United States, Russia, and China. > In Khan's combined 55-page response, he says the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the ICC, allowed it to prosecute crimes that take place in the territory of member states, regardless of where the perpetrators hail from. The judges are expected to render a decision in the coming months. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rybczxvvjg	2025-01-14T06:07:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/05/20/H1xiW3uXC/H1xiW3uXC_0_0_1200_800_0_small.jpg
US agencies warn of potential New Orleans copycat attack	The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Monday warned of a potential public safety threat from violent extremists who might try to copy the New Year's Day attack in New Orleans that killed 14 people. The warning comes a week before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. 'The FBI and DHS are concerned about possible copycat or retaliatory attacks due to the persistent appeal of vehicle ramming as a tactic for aspiring violent extremist attackers,' the agencies said in a statement. Early on New Year's Day, more than a dozen people and a dozen others injured about when a man rammed a rented pickup truck into a crowd of revelers along Bourbon Street in New Orleans. The man who carried out the attack was a U.S. Army veteran who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State and appeared to have made recordings condemning music, drugs and alcohol.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk5qkxew1g	2025-01-14T05:08:07-08:00	
Head of hostage NGO believes US journalist Tice still in Syria	The head of an American organization focused on hostage releases said on Monday he believes U.S. journalist Austin Tice was still being held in Syria by people loyal to toppled leader Bashar al-Assad. Speaking to Reuters in Damascus, Nizar Zakka said he believed Tice was being held by 'very few people in a safe house in order to do an exchange or a deal.' Zakka, a Lebanese businessman with U.S. permanent residency who was held in Iran for four years until 2019 on charges of spying, is the president of Hostage Aid Worldwide. He has traveled to Syria multiple times following Assad's ouster by rebels on Dec. 8 in a bid to track down Tice, a former U.S. Marine and a freelance journalist who was abducted in 2012 while reporting in Damascus on the uprising against Assad. Zakka said his group's own investigation had revealed Tice was still in Syria, and that 'a lot of progress' had been made in his hunt in recent weeks. But he added that Syria's new rulers, led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), had not provided much assistance.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjwlklnd1x	2025-01-14T05:07:01-08:00	
The first time I dared to dance again opened my mind': Helping N...	As Israel grappled with the shock of the events of October 7, Nova festival survivors and their families faced a series of challenges for which there was no institutional support. Stepping in to help were New York’s Jewish community, which has donated over 10 million shekels to various organizations and initiatives aiding in the recovery process. 'Without them we would be in a completely different place,' says Nova Tribe co-founder Naama Shmulevitz 'At first, I couldn’t even leave the house,' recalls Orian Shtaif, a survivor of the Nova Festival massacre. Like many others who endured the horror, Shtaif emerged physically unscathed but deeply emotionally scarred. 'I was in a very dark place,' she says. 'I couldn’t even begin to understand what post-trauma meant, what trauma was, or what I had experienced there.' The loss of trust in her surroundings, combined with overwhelming emotions, left her struggling with negative thoughts. It was the UJA-Federation of New York that stepped in to support Shtaif and other survivors. The philanthropic organization quickly backed several initiatives established in the aftermath of October 7, including Nova Tribe, a group founded by the festival’s organizers. 'The Jewish Diaspora was there for us from the start,' says Naama Shmulevitz, one of Nova Tribe's founders. 'We formed an incredible bond built on mutual trust. Their support allowed us to expand our activities—community days, wellness events, and social workshops. It wasn’t just financial assistance; it was a genuine partnership. Without the New York Federation (UJA), we would be in a completely different place.' UJA’s contribution to Nova survivors is part of a broader, massive aid effort for those impacted by the war. To date, more than 10 million shekels have been allocated to support organizations working with Nova survivors and their families. These funds have helped establish therapeutic farms focused on mental health and healing, fund community events, and launch rehabilitation programs for survivors, their families, and bereaved families. 'This is an unprecedented event that the world has never seen before,' says Gabriel Sod, Director of Government Relations at UJA Federation New York. 'Hundreds murdered, dozens taken hostage at a festival. How do you even respond to something like this? It forced us to think differently, to look for creative solutions. If there’s one defining feature of the Nova community, it’s exactly that—creative, socially innovative entrepreneurs who, just days after the massacre, approached us with groundbreaking ideas to support the survivors.' Still living through the trauma One such initiative is SafeHeart, a program dedicated to supporting survivors. As Efrat Atun, the organization’s CEO, explains: 'Our organization was founded by people who had already been providing emotional support at parties for years. We began operating on October 7 itself. We set up a website and reached out to those who attended the festival to connect them with therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers. Within two weeks, 500 volunteers were assisting 2,500 individuals.' 'At first, we thought we were only here for a short time, like damage control,' Atun continues. 'By mid-October, we realized we had misread the situation. This terrorist attack happened on October 7 but, in many ways, is still ongoing. People are still living through it. That’s when we decided to formally establish the organization.' 'Beyond providing individual support,' says Gabriel Sod, 'we quickly understood that the cornerstone of our strategy with the festival survivors had to be the community—not just the survivors themselves, the bereaved families, and the survivors' families, but also the community as a whole. Just days after October 7, the festival organizers set a goal: ‘We will dance again,’ and began a journey of healing and rebuilding the community. We knew our role was to help them accomplish this goal.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The support from the Jewish Diaspora enabled not only an immediate response but also the development of long-term solutions. 'Our donors in New York understood that this is a commitment extending beyond the immediate crisis—it’s an ongoing partnership.' As Atun explains: 'UJA-NY is our most significant partner. Since December and January, we’ve been in close contact. They not only provided financial support but also connected us with additional foundations, the government, and strategic partners. They helped us establish retreats and group processes for survivors and their families, showing them they are not alone.' To date, SafeHeart has supported around 3,000 survivors and 500 family members, with over 1,000 individuals currently receiving ongoing therapy. Over the past year, more than 26,000 hours of therapy have been provided. 'The first time I dared to dance again, after a period when I couldn’t even listen to music, it opened my mind,' says Shtaif. 'I realized that it’s okay not to feel okay. I have people I can rely on, and the strength comes from the community.' Still, despite extensive efforts, many survivors face a long road to recovery. 'Most survivors have not yet returned to their routines,' emphasizes Atun. 'They need continued support from both the community and the state. We are committed to standing by them and ensuring they are not alone. The trauma is still very raw. We’re deeply concerned and understand how much work lies ahead and how much the survivors still need us.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjl1vjvd1l	2025-01-14T04:29:57-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/02/r1Jli14L1x/r1Jli14L1x_0_131_1504_847_0_small.jpg

Katz introduces Haredi exemption law waiving service for most unt...	Security minister briefs Knesset committee without IDF representatives, shows plan to draft 50% of the ultra-Orthodox men eligible for service after seven years; mother of fallen soldier in protest march calling for equal draft for all The Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, chaired by MK Yuli Edelstein, convened with Defense Minister Israel Katz on Tuesday to be briefed on the proposed draft exemption law for the ultra-Orthodox sector. After nearly six months of closed-door negotiations among coalition leaders, Katz didn’t introduce a draft of law as promised but presented 'principles to achieve the goal of significantly increasing the number of yeshiva students serving in the military, while regulating the status of those engaged in full-time Torah study.' Katz, who attended the meeting without IDF representatives, said he came to present principles for 'advancing a framework to integrate tens of thousands of ultra-Orthodox individuals into meaningful service in the IDF, while ensuring conditions that respect their lifestyle. This aims to alleviate the burden on reservists and active-duty soldiers.' In addition to integrating the ultra-Orthodox, Katz said that he would not promote a law with the principle of 'preserving the Jewish Torah world,' which he views as 'a central foundation of our existence as a people and as a Jewish state in the Land of Israel. Katz outlined a main goal of drafting 50% of 19-year-olds from the ultra-Orthodox community, with a gradual timeline for achieving this. According to the IDF's projections, 4,800 ultra-Orthodox men would be drafted in the first year, increasing to 5,700 in the second year, with incremental increases each year thereafter. However, the IDF has previously said that it would have no limitation on absorbing additional soldiers starting in 2026. Despite this position, when asked when the draft rate for ultra-Orthodox youth would reach 50%, Katz responded it would only occur in the seventh year, which means that most ultra-Orthodox men of draft age would be exempt from military service until 2032 at the least. Katz also said that to ensure compliance with the goals, 'unlike previous arrangements, this law proposes economic sanctions for failing to meet the annual targets.' He said sanctions would apply to all yeshivas for students eligible for military service. 'Those not studying would be carefully scrutinized and sanctioned — not just the yeshivas, as was not the case previously.' Katz's proposal suggest that only partial and economic sanctions would be imposed. 'If we fail to meet the targets, we’ll introduce a new law to impose all necessary sanctions.' Meanwhile sources in the ultra-Orthodox parties said they would not support a bill that included sanctions imposed on those who do not enlist. Amid ultra-Orthodox protests against the bill, senior rabbis have voiced strong opposition to IDF enlistment, including a former chief rabbi who urged followers to discard draft orders. Addressing this opposition, Katz said, 'Is integrating the ultra-Orthodox into security and the economy necessary? Absolutely. Is it possible? Only by consent.' Two hours before the committee convened, Laly Dery, the mother of Sgt. First Class (res.) Saadia Yaakov Dery, who was killed on June 20 last year in Gaza led a protest march from the military cemetery in Jerusalem to the Knesset, in protest of Kat's proposed bill.

Warning: Iranians bait Israeli civilians abroad, to kidnap them	The National Security Council reveals Iranian officials reach out to Israeli, hoping to lure him to Dubai and abduct him; following investigation, NSC concludes Iran plans to harm Israelis abroad The National Security Council warned Israelis on Tuesday that hostile actors were pretending to be various organizations, and luring Israelis to travel to foreign countries where they would be harmed or abducted. Following an Iranian attempt to lure an Israeli businessman to the United Arab Emirates, the National Security Council has released a warning to the public that Tehran was increasing its efforts to harm to Israeli citizens abroad. Intelligence sources in the National Security Council discovered that Iranian officials contacted an Israeli businessman on Telegram, posing as the Persian department of the Saudi television network Al-Arabiya, to lure him to meet with them in Dubai. In addition, it was discovered that the same officials sent Israeli links and malicious files to gain access to his phone, without his knowledge. The businessman reported the suspicious incident to the National Security Council, and the organization conducted an investigation that revealed that terrorist elements were behind the attempt. The National Security Council noted that 'this is another manifestation of the continuing threat of Iranian terrorism against Israelis in Israel and around the world.' 'The incident highlights the potential risk in contacting unknown entities that make unusual offers online. Particularly when the request is accompanied by requests for personal details, information about movements abroad and/or sending files, including sending links and emails.' the National Security Council said. The council explained that to prevent and reduce the risks, 'the Israeli public must maintain privacy on social networks and avoid sharing details such as phone numbers, real-time location and future plans.' The organization also noted that providing these details will help terrorist elements gather important information about the potential targets, improve the nature of the offer, and ensure the success of their mission to harm Israelis. > The National Security Council asked the public to report any suspicious behavior by unknown parties from abroad, especially when traveling outside the country. If any concern arises that you have been exposed to a threat from terrorist elements, it is recommended to inform the local security services of the country in which you are staying, and then the National Security Council's travel warning center. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skmd2nmvkg	2025-01-14T03:15:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/14/rJZXd5QPye/rJZXd5QPye_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Iran, Europeans meet on nuclear program, report	Iran's deputy foreign minister says in a post that talks were serious, frank, and constructive adding there was agreement that negotiations for a deal should resume Talks held in Geneva between Iran, Britain, France and Germany will see dialogue continue regarding Tehran's disputed nuclear program, Iran's official news agency reported on Tuesday. 'The talks were serious, frank, and constructive. We discussed ideas involving certain details in the sanctions-lifting and nuclear fields that are needed for a deal,' Kazem Gharibabadi, Iran's deputy foreign minister for international and legal affairs, wrote on X on Monday. 'Sides concurred that negotiations should be resumed and to reach a deal, all parties should create and maintain the appropriate atmosphere. We agreed to continue our dialogue,' he added. The talks held on Monday followed earlier discussions in November. At that time, an Iranian official told Reuters that finalizing a roadmap with Europeans would 'put the ball in the U.S. court to revive or kill the nuclear deal.' In 2018, the U.S., led by then-President Donald Trump, exited Iran's 2015 nuclear pact with six major powers and re-imposed harsh sanctions on Iran. That prompted Tehran to violate the pact's nuclear limits, with moves such as rebuilding stockpiles of enriched uranium, refining it to higher fissile purity and installing advanced centrifuges to speed up output. Indirect talks between U.S. President Joe Biden's administration and Tehran to try to revive the pact have failed.

I forced Netanyahu to reject earlier deals,' Ben-Gvir reveals	National Security Minister says he no longer has the deciding votes to compel the prime minister to reject a hostage release deal as he had done before, calls on Smotrich to join his resignation; Netanyahu previously rejected claims of political considerations National Security Council Itamar Ben-Gvir said on Tuesday that he had prevented Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from accepting previous attempts at securing a hostage release deal but was currently outnumbered in the coalition. He called on Finance Minister Bezalel Smortrich to join him in threatening resignation from the coalition to block the prime minister's intention to accept a deal now. 'In the past year, through our political strength, we succeeded in preventing such a deal from being made, time and again,' he said. Since Foreign Minister Gideon Saar and his New Hope faction joined the coalition, Ben-Gvir's Otzman Yehudit Party had lost its leverage to force his view on the government. Netanyahu had previously rejected claims that he had refused proposals for a deal that would have seen hostages released, out of political considerations and fears that his government would be toppled and directed blame for the failure of negotiations, on Hamas. 'The pending deal is terrible, I know its details well,' Ben-Gvir said in a long post on X. 'It includes the release of hundreds of murderous terrorists from prison, the return of Gazans to the northern part of the Strip, the withdrawal of the IDF from the Netzarim Corridor and the renewed threat to the residents of the Gaza border area.

Hardened terrorists that Hamas demands in exchange of hostages	Terror group names some of the most notorious Palestinian terrorists serving sentences in Israel that must be released when a deal is agreed As part of the ongoing negotiations for a hostage deal, Hamas has submitted a list of Palestinian prisoners it demands to have released from Israeli prisons. At this stage, it's unclear who will be released under the pending agreement, but Hamas is demanding the release of senior terrorists serving life sentences. According to an unverified Saudi report, Hamas also demanded the inclusion of the body of its assassinated leader, Yahya Sinwar, in the deal. However, an Israeli source said that 'this won’t happen.' While the terror group has requested a significant number of prisoners with blood on their hands who were sentenced to life imprisonment for murderous attacks, these are some of the most notorious prisoners Hamas is asking to be released: Abdullah Barghouti: A Hamas terrorist who was one of the commanders of the organization's military wing in the West Bank. Barghouti is currently serving 67 life sentences, an unprecedented punishment in Israel. Hamas failed to secure his release in the Gilad Shalit release deal in 2011. Marwan Barghouti: Served as the Fatah movement’s secretary-general in the West Bank and was arrested on April 15, 2002. Barghouti orchestrated terrorist attacks in which five Israelis were killed and many others injured. In 2004, he was sentenced to five consecutive life terms and an additional 40 years in prison. Ahmed Saadat: secretary-general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the planner of the assassination of Minister Rehavam Ze'evi in 2001. Saadat is considered a popular and significant figure in Palestinian society. Israel refused to release him in the Shalit deal. Ibrahim Hamed: Hamed was the 'mastermind' behind 90% of suicide bombing attacks during the Second Intifada between 2000 and 2005. He served as the commander of the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades in the West Bank at the time. In his role, he planned and organized numerous attacks against Israelis, including severe suicide bombings. He has been wanted by Israeli security forces since 1998. Abbas al-Sayyed: The principal planner of the 2002 Passover massacre in Netanya. He was sentenced to 35 life terms for the murder of Israelis.

Salam’s nomination is seen by many as a glimpse of hope after the 14-month Israel-Hezbollah war that left 4,000 people dead and more than 16,000 wounded and caused destruction totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. The war stopped in late November when a U.S.-brokered 60-day truce went into effect. Shortly after Salam won majority backing from legislators, some people celebrated in the streets of Beirut with fireworks amid hopes that his nomination and last week’s election of army commander Gen. Joseph Aoun as president would help release billions of dollars of investments and loans by foreign donors. Salam will have a difficult mission ahead of him following the truce with Israel that caused widespread destruction in the Mediterranean nation and weakened the Iran-backed Hezbollah. He will also have to work on getting the small nation out of its historic five-year economic meltdown. In past years, Hezbollah has repeatedly blocked Salam from becoming prime minister, casting him as a U.S.-backed candidate. 'We will see their acts when it comes to forcing the occupiers to leave our country, bringing back prisoners, reconstruction' and the implementation of the U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the Israel-Hezbollah war, the head of Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc, Mohammed Raad, said after meeting with Aoun. Raad added that Hezbollah extended its hand last week by electing Aoun and they were hoping to meet an extended hand from the other side, 'but this hand was cut off.' Last week’s election of Aoun as president and Monday’s nomination of Salam is likely to lead to a flow of funds from Western and oil-rich Arab nations to Lebanon to help in the reconstruction process. Tens of thousands of Lebanese have lost their savings since the country’s banking sector crashed as a result of the economic crisis. Neither Aoun nor Salam are considered part of the country’s political class that is blamed for widespread corruption and mismanagement over the past decades that exploded in October 2019 into one of the world’s worst economic meltdowns in more than a century. Lebanon has been run by a caretaker government for more than two years and Aoun was elected after a 26-month vacuum in the president’s post. After a day of consultations between Aoun and legislators, Salam got the backing of 84 deputies, while outgoing Prime Minister Najib Mikati received nine votes. Thirty-four legislators from the 128-member legislature abstained. Shortly after the results came out, Mikati called Salam to congratulate him and wish him luck with the new job. Antoine Shoukeir, the presidency’s director general, told reporters after the consultations that Salam now is prime minister-designate, adding that he is currently outside Lebanon and should be back in the coming hours. A meeting was scheduled for Tuesday at the presidential palace in Beirut’s southeastern suburb of Baabda between Aoun, Salam and parliament Speaker Nabih Berri after which he will start the process of forming a new Cabinet. It was not immediately clear whether Salam plans to resign as head of the ICJ. 'My voice is for Nawaf Salam because my voice is for Lebanon and no one else,' independent legislator Paula Yacoubian told journalists after meeting with Aoun. Salam, 71, is a member of a prominent Sunni Muslim family from Beirut and his late paternal uncle, Saeb Salam, was one of the Lebanese leaders who fought for the country’s independence from France and later served several terms as Lebanon’s prime minister. Salam’s cousin, Tammam, also served as prime minister for two years starting in 2014. Salam holds a doctorate in political science from France’s prestigious Sciences Po university as well as a doctorate in history from France’s Sorbonne University. He also has a Master of Laws degree from Harvard Law School. Salam has worked as a lecturer at several universities, including the American University of Beirut. In 2007, he was named Lebanon’s ambassador to the United Nations, where he served for 10 years. In 2018, Salam was elected as a judge on the ICJ and in February last year he was elected as president of the court becoming the first Lebanese citizen to hold the post. Salam is married to journalist Sahar Baasiri, who for many years was a columnist at Lebanon’s leading An-Nahar daily. Baasiri has been serving since 2018 as Lebanon’s ambassador to UNESCO.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjeb7uxwje	2025-01-13T20:46:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/13/B1KEcCfPyx/B1KEcCfPyx_0_165_1857_1045_0_small.jpg
Trump reveals hostage deal nears end 'there's been a handshake'	U.S. president-elect says in an interview that he believed an agreement was imminent, 'perhaps by the end of the week' warning that if the deal is not struck 'there would be trouble 'like never seen before' U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he believed there was a handshake between parties in the negotiations for a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Doha and that the talks were nearing the end.

Prof. Benny Miller: 'It’s good that Trump is becoming the American President, because I think now the chances of deliberation of the hostages is much greater than it was before' A second phase of a hostage-for-ceasefire deal, potentially securing the release of more of the 98 hostages still held in Gaza, is likely under U.S. President Donald Trump, according to Prof. Benny Miller, an international relations expert from the University of Haifa. Speaking to ILTV on Monday, Miller explained that Qatar and Egypt are deeply concerned about Trump taking office, given their heavy reliance on U.S. security support. They fear Trump may penalize them if it appears they are not applying sufficient pressure on Hamas.

Israeli, Danish FMs clash over UNRWA	Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar: 'We don’t have any trust in an organization that demonstrated that its personnel were involved in terrorism' Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar and Danish Foreign Minister Lars Rasmussen clashed Monday on whether the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) could effectively be replaced in Gaza, the West Bank, and Jerusalem. The United Nations agency is slated to cease operations at the end of the month. At a joint press conference, Sa’ar stated that Israel is committed to ensuring the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. 'There are more organizations, UN agencies, NGOs, and countries participating in this effort,' Sa’ar said. 'We don’t have any trust in an organization that demonstrated that its personnel were involved in terrorism, were infiltrated by Hamas, and that its installations were used as command and communication centers for Hamas.' Sa’ar explained that Israeli legislation passed last year prohibits the country’s authorities from engaging with UNRWA and bars the agency from operating within Israel. The legislation effectively mandates the termination of UNRWA’s activities in the region. Rasmussen countered, saying that he and Sa’ar 'do not see eye to eye' on the matter and affirmed Denmark’s 'steadfast support' of UNRWA, contributing around $75 million annually. 'There have been, and perhaps to some extent still are, problems linked to individuals within the organization of UNRWA,' Rasmussen said, noting that all parties should work hard to address these issues. However, he added, 'We cannot see any alternative to UNRWA, at least not in the short-term perspective. If you look at the West Bank, I think UNRWA is the second-largest employer. 'In order to ensure that we have the needed infrastructure to provide for the Palestinians in the region—the West Bank, Gaza, and the surrounding countries—with access to healthcare, education, etc., we do not see any alternative.' Israel accused several UNRWA employees of participating in the October 7 massacre against Israel and alleged that others had ties to the terror organization. Sa’ar hosted Rasmussen at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jerusalem on Monday. The two leaders began with an extended private meeting, followed by discussions with their respective teams, and concluded with a joint press conference. The visit largely focused on the hostage-for-ceasefire deal, regional security concerns, and opportunities for economic and technological collaboration.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjasqwxvje	2025-01-13T19:48:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/14/BkqwnDmPke/BkqwnDmPke_0_204_1600_901_0_small.jpg

Col. Richard Kemp: 'My name was found on an al-Qaeda death list i...	Former British commander details his thoughts on fighting for Israel on the global stage, geopolitical threats and the world's anti-Israel stance Col. Richard Kemp, a British Army veteran, is one of Israel's most cogent and effective spokespersons who stood by the country since the war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023. Talking to Ynet on Monday, he said this came at a significant price for him: 'I had many threats made to my life for my support of Israel.' Kemp served in active duty from 1977 to 2006, during which time he held the position of an infantry battalion commanding officer. His tenure included leading Operation Fingal in Afghanistan from July 2003 to November 2003. Following his retirement, Kemp, in collaboration with Chris Hughes, authored 'Attack State Red,' a book detailing the 2007 Afghanistan campaign carried out by the Royal Anglian Regiment, including their initial deployment. He also wrote the British forces' doctrine on dealing with suicide bombings. 'My name was found on an al-Qaeda death list in Syria a few years ago. Very rarely does a day go past without me receiving on social media severe threats against me and my family as well as a result of my support for Israel,' he said, adding these threats don’t worry him but are rather a compliment knowing he’s prodding in the right way to show the truth. 'The IDF, Prime Minister's Office and the Ministry of Defense in Israel have been doing an extraordinary job in a very demanding and complex situation.' 'I'm attempting to tell the truth about a situation that's so often distorted in the Western media, particularly on social media. If anything, it will encourage me even more to continue supporting Israel.' 'The key to the conflict is Iran' Kemp, who kept fighting for Israel following Hamas’ attack, made it clear Israel is the victim in the current war. 'But it's not just a war against Israel. It's also a war against the West. It's striking against all of our Western values. When you look at protests in the UK and in the U.S. and other countries, which actually support Hamas, they may not say they do, but the practical effect is to support Hamas.' When asked about his advice to Israeli leaders amid the war, Kemp said: 'I don't think Israel's leadership needs my advice. As far as I can see, the IDF, Prime Minister's Office and the Ministry of Defense in Israel have been doing an extraordinary job in a very demanding and complex situation.' 'I do believe that the key to the conflict is Iran,' he added. 'Iran has been severely damaged by the partial destruction of Hezbollah, the partial destruction of Hamas and the loss of Syria, all of which are down to Israeli actions. I think now it's the next major target really for Israel's offensive should be directly against Iran itself.' 'I think we're going to see much more of a Turkish-motivated proxy war accelerating against Israel from Syria.' Speaking on the war at large and the Iranian threat, Kemp also stressed that Turkey’s attempts to establish itself in Syria are also a cause for serious consideration and concern: 'I think Turkey has gained immense strength as a result of the fall of [Bashar] Assad.' 'You'll have a really negative jihadist state on your doorstep and that state of course is supported by Turkey that will be should I say the HTS the organization that's now largely in control of Syria is supported by Turkey. They will be a major player in Syria and Turkey of course is a supporter and Sponsor of Hamas maybe they will replace Iran as the main supporter of Hamas and other anti-Israel Jihadist groups in the region.' 'I think we're going to see much more of a Turkish-motivated proxy war accelerating against Israel from Syria,' he warned. As fighting ramps up across all fronts, action against IDF soldiers is taken out of the battlefield and into courtrooms by anti-Israel organizations like the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) trying to prosecute Israeli soldiers for alleged war crimes. 'This is partly a product of weakness in Western governments for actually standing up and telling the truth about what's been going on in Israel.' 'Western governments like Britain and the U.S. know exactly what Israel's doing, yet they also do criticize Israel for infringing human rights and carrying out unnecessary killings. That, of course, fuels the anti-Israel sentiment, which also directly supports and encourages Hamas and targeting Israeli soldiers as part of that,' Kemp said. 'The game will change when Trump comes into the White House' 'I think it's incumbent on Israel to use whatever diplomatic means it can to try and combat any legal action in Western countries, but also down to Western governments,' he added. Kemp also believes that the current hostile environment toward Israel will change once U.S. President-elect Donald Trump enters office next week: 'In many ways, the game will change when Trump comes into the White House.' 'Although the Americans have been extremely supportive of Israel since this war began, they've also in many ways have hampered Israel's efforts by placing numerous restrictions on them, applying a partial arms embargo on Israel and effectively preventing Israel from carrying out some of the actions it needs to carry out. I hope that situation will change when Trump comes into the White House, freeing Israel to be more aggressive,' he explained. 'I think it's incumbent on Israel to use whatever diplomatic means it can to try and combat any legal action in Western countries.' 'For example, we've just seen a bill pass in Congress to sanction the International Criminal Court for its egregious arrest warrants against your prime minister and former defense minister. I'm slightly optimistic on that front from January 20,' Kemp added. Meanwhile, Kemp is concerned with the state the UK is heading toward as topics of grooming and gang rape cases cause heated national debate across the country about its immigration policy. 'We've had decades of pedophile rape gangs of victims sometimes as young as 11, 12-year-old white girls in Britain being targeted by street rape gangs, mainly by Pakistani men, but also Pakistani women assisting in procurement.' 'That's mainly as a result of political correctness and prioritizing a fear of inciting or causing racial tensions as a result of identifying the reality of these Pakistani rape gangs in the UK, prioritizing that over actually stopping it from happening and bringing justice to the offender. Hopefully, we're going to see that causing much more effective action against these rape gangs,' he added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Kemp added that the British public is now waking up to these issues and taking a stand against them. 'It's not just the current British government, but successive British governments have been afraid to tackle this. And by doing so, they've actually encouraged the continuation of these horrible events, which are probably the worst atrocity that has occurred in the UK since the Second World War.' 'Even now the Labour government that's in power has refused to launch what's been demanded, which is a full-scale national inquiry into the problem overall, which affects many different parts of the UK. Hopefully, sufficient pressure will be applied to them now to force their hands.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjxzxkmwyx	2025-01-13T13:23:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/13/rJN0011Jmvke/rJN0011Jmvke_104_0_963_542_0_small.jpg
There are nights we'll never forget': Up close with the Arrow ai...	Exclusive: Serving 24-hour shifts in vault-like rooms across the country, 136th Battalion soldiers face the ballistic missile threat against Israel at all times The soldiers serving at the Arrow missile defense interception center located at an Air Force base in central Israel liken their role to that of a goalkeeper in soccer: excelling throughout most of the game yet receiving attention primarily for the goals conceded. This metaphor reflects over a year of multi-front warfare, during which the system has successfully intercepted missiles launched from across the Middle East. Still, many Israelis focus on the failures such as Iran’s ballistic missiles hitting Israel in the attacks in April and October 2024. 'The Arrow system is the best in the world at intercepting ballistic missiles of this kind, especially given that no other system has faced such heavy barrages and achieved interception rates like ours,' said Lt. Col. Eyal Frankel, commander of the 136th Arrow Battalion. 'Yet, as with any defense system, there are cases where it doesn’t succeed. Defense isn't airtight and we must always assume some threats will slip through. We use multiple defense systems to maximize interception chances, but sometimes it still doesn’t work.' How's morale after such incidents? 'Whether the failure is due to human or machine error, not completing the mission is tough. But we train our personnel to handle failure and understand it’s part of the job. Sometimes missiles fall because we decide not to defend certain areas. 'That decision isn’t natural for us — we can’t bear to see a missile hit. We have discussions to prepare the team for future challenges. It’s part of being a defender, like a goalkeeper who has to cope with conceding a goal.' The Arrow interception center is one of the most classified sites in Israel, where life-and-death decisions have been made daily since the war began on October 7. While Israelis scramble to bomb shelters in their pajamas during nighttime sirens, rows of uniformed personnel sit in front of dozens of screens, surrounded by radios, lights and constant beeping. Ultimately, one person decides when, where and how to press the button to intercept a ballistic missile launched thousands of kilometers away, often from Yemen or Iran. Operators undergo two years of training and then work grueling 24-hour shifts, sometimes longer. 'Nice to meet you, I’m R. from Ashdod,' says a 21-year-old lieutenant wearing glasses perched on her nose. Describing her role, she says, 'I’m an interception officer. All of us have combat training — I was a combat soldier before coming here. I’ve since completed training that qualifies me for all the roles, from field operations to this position. 'We sit here for hours, making tough, high-stakes decisions. We’re responsible for intercepting ballistic missiles that leave the atmosphere. The system includes Arrow 1 and Arrow 2 and we work directly with other defense systems like Iron Dome and David’s Sling.' Why is combat experience necessary for this role? 'We have just seconds to make challenging decisions and it requires a combat mindset — knowing what it’s like to be called into action and function in combat within moments. It’s combat, even if it’s through a screen. It’s stressful but also exhilarating.' What’s exhilarating about it? 'Intercepting a missile over my home in Ashdod and then calling my parents to ask how they’re doing.' The Arrow battery commander, Maj. L., shared: 'A few weeks ago, missiles were launched toward my home in Rishon LeZion, where my wife and baby live. From the moment the missile is launched and we receive the alert, we know exactly where it’s headed to strike. It’s more stressful than exciting. 'After my shift, I called my wife the next morning to ask how she was, and she replied, ‘You’re calling now? It happened in the middle of the night.’ I laughed. She, like many civilians, doesn’t understand what goes on behind the scenes and how much human involvement is behind every system decision — from the field to R. here operating the button.' Sitting nearby is Lt. A. from Nes Ziona, also an interception officer. 'We’re experiencing events that haven’t happened in decades,' he says. 'My dad is a commander here on the base, also part of the system. What I’ve done in my relatively short service, he hasn’t done in 20 years. We’re not happy about the situation but it’s meaningful to be part of this.' A historic night The Arrow system is a layer of Israel’s comprehensive air defense, which protects the skies from drones, missiles and rockets. The system is built on several layers: Iron Dome handles short-range targets and aerial threats, David’s Sling intercepts longer-range rockets and cruise missiles and the Arrow systems are designed to counter long-range ballistic missiles. During the war in Gaza, it intercepted launches from Iran, Yemen, Syria and beyond. Entrance to the interception center requires removing any device that could be exploited by the enemy — mobile phones, smart watches, earphones, even the Ynet photographer’s camera. Walking through the fortified rooms, resembling safes, leads to a dimly lit control room filled with darkened screens. On the surface, it seems like an ordinary room, but Lt. Col. Frankel explains that the site is so classified they had to prepare it specifically ahead of the journalists’ visit. 'Don’t be disappointed,' he asks. On shift, the room hosts a commander and four interception officers seated at a row of computers. Behind them sits a reservist and Frankel proudly points to her: 'She’s been with us for a long time, a mother of children who enlisted to support the system and hardly spends nights at home. Do you see the level of sacrifice here and how critical manpower is?' The control room is responsible for implementing decisions handed down from the political and military leadership. These include protocols on which missile to launch, where to intercept and which areas are prioritized for protection. 'These decisions come from much higher up following detailed discussions and they change hourly, not even daily,' Frankel adds. In a nearby room, a group of technicians in blue overalls manages the technological systems. From fixing a faulty computer button to addressing a technical issue with a deployed battery, someone must resolve problems immediately, as delays could impact an entire launch. 'There are many more rooms here,' the commander continues without elaborating. 'On the night of the first Iranian attack, this place was packed to capacity. It was a historic moment. Dozens of people, including senior commanders, were called in to operate all these computers. People think this system is purely technological. They don’t realize how much it depends on human input.' A nationwide unit A tour outside the Arrow interception center reveals the quintessential image of an Air Force base: a pastoral, pristine and meticulously maintained compound. Senior officers live with their families just minutes away from some of the most operationally critical rooms in the Middle East. Yet, the tension is palpable and the quiet is almost unnerving. Everyone is always on edge, always busy. Every uniformed individual seems to be heading somewhere on a mission. 'I'm Eyal Frankel, 41 years old, a father of four and battalion commander since August 2023, two months before the war,' he introduces himself. 'I've been serving in the Arrow system since 2004, growing through every role along the way.' Beside him sits his deputy, Maj. A, 31, and a father of two. He also lives on the base but barely sees home. 'I took on the role last August,' he shares. 'I didn't grow up in the Arrow system but in Iron Dome. As part of the development process for deputy commanders and battalion leaders, we wanted to give them exposure to other weapons systems. 'The goal is to provide knowledge and learn from another system to become better commanders. This required me to learn Arrow from scratch, go through certifications and training and do it quickly — unlike soldiers who grow up in the system.' Beyond interception, Arrow soldiers bear another responsibility — issuing alerts to civilians. 'To succeed, we need to master many professional domains,' Lt. Col. Frankel explains. 'A ballistic missile traveling from a distance carries hundreds of kilograms of explosives. It's simple physics: for it to reach Israel, it must go through certain processes while airborne. 'The result is that the missile arrives with fragments and debris, which makes it a significant challenge to intercept the relevant part of the missile mid-air.' The unit isn’t confined to just one base. The launchers, detection equipment, soldiers, technicians and support staff are spread across various points nationwide, from north to south. Divided into launch divisions, they’re equipped with mobile command and control vehicles and other resources to provide optimal protection. 'Right now, you're in a nice site, but that's not how it works in reality,' Frankel adds. 'To deploy effectively, you need to move constantly to adapt capabilities to the evolving scenario. The mobility of detection and launch systems creates a lot of fieldwork — day, night, weekdays, weekends, rain or heat. It's a massive challenge, especially for reservists who've been under emergency call-ups since the war began. It’s a complex operation.' One key figure in ensuring the unit functions smoothly is Capt. S., 25, the battalion’s logistics officer. 'I’m a base-and-housing child,' she admits. 'My father is an Air Force officer and a retired lieutenant colonel. We just ate together in the dining hall. At headquarters, we support all the unit's sites nationwide. 'I don’t have a predictable day—not even the next hour. During the war, the unit doubled in size and we need to meet the needs of both regular and reserve forces — from lodging and gear like vests and helmets to transportation and all operational vehicle logistics. Without the drivers, we couldn't sustain the mission of providing protection 24/7. I might be in the north at 8 a.m. and in Eilat by dawn the next day. That’s what this entire war period looks like for us.' Hours upon hours of debriefings A missile launched from Yemen or Iran can reach Israel within about 10 minutes. During this brief time, detection systems must identify it and map out its threats. Within these moments, countless decisions need to be made. The Arrow 3 interceptor targets distant, high-altitude threats, requiring launch decisions within seconds. 'You sit in front of a blank screen for an hour, two hours, 24 hours, a week, a month, even 20 years before the war, during which nothing happens. Then, in real-time, you have to be at peak readiness,' says Lt. Col. Frankel. 'It's always on your mind. You go to sleep at 3:00 a.m., knowing you might need to jump into action and perform at your best within seconds. If it's stressful for civilians, imagine what it's like for those managing the interception process.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Missiles launched from distant countries leave the atmosphere and even when intercepted, fragments can still fall toward Israel,' he continues. 'That’s why we must protect civilians even after a successful interception of the missile’s relevant components.' How do you feel about instances where missiles hit despite efforts? Maj. A: 'Events like these actually boost our motivation because they highlight the importance of what we do daily. In any case, after every success or failure, we conduct a series of debriefings. We spend hours analyzing what happened and how to improve next time. There’s no moment of rest.' What were the most significant events of the war? Lt. Col. Frankel: 'On October 3, we had the Arrow’s first operational interception in the Yemen front. Just like the Iranian nights of April 14 and October 1, we’ll never forget it. And it wasn’t just us — everyone involved in the defense industries and those responsible for developing this weapon over the decades was moved to tears. 'That missile turned out to be not so threatening because we proved we were ready. Seeing all the training and professional expertise materialize during nights of operational success is a unique feeling. If it weren’t about dangerous missiles, we might even enjoy it.' 'It’s not like we want missiles to be fired at Israel, but when it happens and succeeds, it’s a source of immense pride and satisfaction. The first time it happened, there was great excitement among those on duty at the interception console. 'But since then, we’ve gone through a lot. We all take part in these interceptions, whether it’s the technician or the soldier pressing the button. It’s the joint effort of many people that makes it work. 'We prepared for an attack from Iran and Yemen on October 7 too. We deployed defenses before we even believed it would happen. Now, we’re preparing for other threats we hadn’t even dreamed of.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy3beemvjx	2025-01-13T12:55:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/09/Hkl002uhTU1l/Hkl002uhTU1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
US agencies warn of potential New Orleans copycat attack	The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Monday warned of a potential public safety threat from violent extremists in response to the New Year's Day attack in New Orleans, Louisiana. 'The FBI and DHS are concerned about possible copycat or retaliatory attacks due to the persistent appeal of vehicle ramming as a tactic for aspiring violent extremist attackers. Previous attackers inspired by foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs) who have conducted vehicle attacks in the United States and abroad have used rented, stolen, and personally owned vehicles, which are easy to acquire,' the agencies said in a statement.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjuxvb7wkx	2025-01-13T12:35:43-08:00

Israel estimates most hostages on Hamas list of 33 are alive	Number of Palestinian prisoners to be freed depends on confirmed number of living hostages, with Hamas’ Nukhba terrorists excluded; convicted murderers will be exiled; Israel plans to hold Philadelphi Corridor during first 42-day phase of deal Israeli officials acknowledged Monday night that they remain uncertain about the precise number of Hamas prisoners, out of an expected 1,300, to be released in a looming hostage deal. Israel has effectively withdrawn its demand for a list of living captives from Hamas, which has yet to provide such documentation. The initial release of 33 hostages includes women, children, elderly individuals over 50 and the injured or ill, none of whom have been declared deceased. However, officials caution that some may not be alive, leaving the criteria for the initial release phase unresolved. Israeli estimates suggest that most of the 33 captives, including female soldiers, civilians and children, are likely alive. The agreement outlines a phased release schedule over 42 days, beginning with women and children, followed by female soldiers. Although the deal is structured in three stages, Israeli officials believe it may be condensed into two. The first phase includes a 42-day cease-fire, with discussions on subsequent phases expected to begin on the 16th day. Israel aims to finalize and announce the agreement as early as Tuesday. Preparations are underway in the Prime Minister's Office for expedited approval. Once the deal is ratified by the Cabinet and the government, the list of prisoners to be released will be published, allowing the public less than 48 hours to submit appeals to the Supreme Court. Officials hope to implement the agreement this week, ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20. Diplomatic sources expressed cautious optimism, describing the negotiations as 'at a very advanced stage.' However, a senior official warned that 'we are not yet at the final closure phase. We hope there will be agreement on the deal’s components, but this does not depend on us.' A source familiar with the talks told Reuters that the agreement is 'closer than ever.' Negotiators are set to hold another round of talks Tuesday morning to finalize details. Expected participants include Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, Biden envoy Brett McGurk and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed Al-Thani. Hamas commandos will remain behind bars; murderers will be exiled The senior Israeli official said that members of Hamas’ elite Nukhba forces captured in Gaza will not be released in the initial stages of the deal. Convicted murderers who are freed as part of the agreement will not return to the West Bank but will instead be exiled to Gaza or abroad, with Qatar and Turkey emerging as potential destinations, according to reports in Arab media. Diplomatic sources said that 'significant assets,' including geographic leverage and prisoners, will be reserved for subsequent negotiations until all hostages—alive and deceased—are returned. They noted that while a similar number of prisoner releases was discussed in May, Hamas at the time had proposed returning only a small number of living hostages. 'Recently, Hamas has shown movement,' the officials added. Despite Arab media reports suggesting otherwise, Hamas has yet to provide a definitive response to the draft proposal presented to both sides. 'We will update the public periodically in the next 24 hours,' officials said. 'Progress has been made on the overall agreement formula in coordination with mediators and both U.S. administrations—outgoing and incoming. The Middle East has undergone significant changes in recent months, including the weakening of the Shiite axis and Hamas' diminished capabilities. These shifts, along with Trump’s incoming presidency, have created optimal conditions for a deal. The timing is highly sensitive.' The senior official revealed that the U.S. presented a proposal in April, to which Hamas did not respond. On May 5, 2024, Hamas submitted its counterproposal, claiming it did not hold 33 hostages. It took until June 11 for Hamas to respond to an Israeli proposal following President Joe Biden’s speech on May 27. The response included 29 amendments, signaling an unwillingness to finalize a deal. 'At that time, Hamas refused to engage in negotiations,' the official said. 'The shift began after we eliminated Yahya Sinwar and severely damaged the Shiite axis and Hamas’ broader strategy to ignite the Middle East.' Ynet military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai noted that the Prime Minister’s Office is promoting a narrative that the current deal mirrors an agreement Hamas rejected and derailed between May and July 2024. According to the narrative, Hamas was now forced into acceptance due to military pressure, the disintegration of its resistance alliance, and its lost hope that the Biden administration would compel Israel into a cease-fire. 'The agreement is reasonable,' Ben-Yishai said, 'but Gal Hirsch, Israel’s hostage coordinator, emphasized that it could not have been achieved earlier.' Gradual withdrawal Israel will maintain a buffer zone within Gaza during a potential cease-fire as part of the emerging agreement, Israeli officials said. However, the specific depth of the buffer zone within Gaza remains undisclosed. While Israeli forces will not withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor near the border with Egypt, they will permit displaced Gazans to return to northern Gaza, effectively ceding control of the former Netzarim area. The return of displaced persons will be conducted under security arrangements and inspections designed to prevent the movement of weapons and armed terrorists into northern Gaza, officials said. 'At the end of the deal, the IDF will remain deployed in the buffer zone,' a senior Israeli official said, adding that Israel's withdrawal from Gaza would be 'gradual, not immediate, to ensure Hamas fulfills its commitments.' Separately, Israel is preparing adjustments to its humanitarian aid policy for Gaza, irrespective of the deal. 'We are working on a solution to remove humanitarian aid from Hamas' control,' the senior official said. 'This is a critical component of Hamas' governance capabilities, and we're engaged in a long-term campaign. Solutions will take time.' U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan expressed cautious optimism on the negotiations. 'We believe we are close to finalizing the deal,' Sullivan said. 'Whether it will close remains to be seen in the coming days and weeks, but I believe we're close. Gaps are narrowing, and issues are being resolved one by one. This is due to several factors: Israel has achieved its objectives in Gaza, and Hamas has suffered catastrophic losses. While nothing is guaranteed, I believe there’s a good chance we’ll reach the finish line.' The Israeli government is expected to approve the deal, despite opposition from the far-right Religious Zionist and Otzma Yehudit parties. Both parties have expressed intent to vote against the agreement but have not issued ultimatums or threatened to leave the coalition. All Likud ministers and ultra-Orthodox party members are anticipated to support the deal, forming a likely majority of 28 ministers in favor versus six opposing votes from the dissenting parties. Netanyahu is holding security consultations with defense officials to finalize details of the agreement and determine the timing for presenting it to the government for approval. Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs is engaging with political figures to garner support for the deal. Netanyahu’s aides believe the political hurdles can be surmounted. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkki61qp1l	2025-01-13T11:08:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/r18Ig3bPyl/r18Ig3bPyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Sometimes, just being there for them is enough': Volunteers help...	Lior and Ruti, both 19, recount their experience of meeting with children who endured Hamas captivity, returned home and now face fear and trauma on the road to recovery 'Do you want to see what a dead person looks like?' the little girl asked as she played outside. She then lay on the ground and demonstrated. A single moment of innocent play turned into a painful reminder of the trauma she endured during the 52 days she was held captive by Hamas in Gaza. In November 2023, as part of the first hostage deal, 37 children who were abducted on the morning of October 7 returned home. According to a recent Health Ministry report, they returned thin, frightened and bearing physical and psychological signs of abuse. On average, they lost 10% of their body weight, with one case reaching 18%. But the deepest scars are those that are unseen. Lior Lixenberg and Ruti Suliman, national civic service volunteers with the Aminadav organization, are there to listen, process and help the children rebuild their lives. Through their work with the Lending a Hand Foundation, they guide the children step by step in their complex journey toward recovery. 'Everyone carries something from their time in captivity,' Lior says. 'For each child, it manifests differently. For some, the post-trauma only emerges now, a while after their return.' From the oncology ward to captivity Lior and Ruti plunged into deep waters. They’re only 19, in their second year of national service. During their first year, they accompanied children with cancer hospitalized in oncology wards, but nothing could have prepared them for their encounter with the children who survived captivity. The cultural differences, they say, added to the challenge — they’re religious, while most of the children are secular, born and raised in kibbutzim. Yet, sometimes, the differences forge the strongest connections. 'At first, it was unimaginable,' Lior recalls of the initial meetings. 'We heard the stories about the war, the abductions, and captivity and suddenly we saw these children in front of us. Now, we’re like their friends. They share everything with us.' How is supporting children who survived captivity different from supporting children with cancer? Lior: 'When you enter an oncology ward, you can see the illness and pain on the patients — the symptoms of the disease are visible. With children who survived captivity, it’s often hard to tell that something is wrong at first. Only when you delve deeper — into their homes, their private spaces — do you truly uncover their pain, their sense of loss and the trauma they’ve endured.' ‘Looking into their eyes, even in the hardest moments’ Their role might sound simple: playing with the children, helping with homework and spending time with them. But beneath this simplicity lies an entire world of responsibility. They've become like big sisters — figures who aren’t children but aren’t too much older either, people the children can trust and feel safe with. What qualities does it take to fulfill your role? Lior: 'You need a high level of empathy, listening skills, patience and stability.' Ruti: 'Emotional intelligence is crucial — to know how to respond to every situation, to look into their eyes even in the hardest moments. You have to think twice before reacting and act thoughtfully.' The children’s daily lives are a constant journey between moments of light and sudden darkness — between innocent play in the yard and memories that surface unexpectedly, between healthy laughter and an empty gaze that suddenly appears. Lior and Ruti navigate these emotional shifts, guiding the children step by step back to life. How does a typical day with the children look? 'Our meetings are usually in the afternoon or evening, when the children aren’t in school,' Lior explains. 'Each session lasts about four hours. Sometimes, we leave the house with them; other times, we stay in. There are families we visit weekly and others less frequently, depending on their needs.' The children and their families’ new reality is like an invisible minefield, with triggers hidden around every corner — Arabic subtitles on TV, a passing car or even a meal at a restaurant. Any of these can instantly bring the children back to their moments of terror in captivity. 'We’re learning to recognize the triggers,' Ruti shares, 'and we know how to help them cope. Sometimes, just being there for them is enough.' At first glance, they look like any other children — playing, laughing, fighting over toys. But beneath the surface lies a deep trauma that sometimes emerges at the most unexpected moments. 'When you meet the children, they seem normal and typical,' Lior shares. 'Only when they start talking and opening up do you realize their sense of loss and see the depth of their trauma. 'Once, I went to the park with a little girl and she came across a sign about the hostages. She stopped to kiss her father's picture. She only knows her father through the photos she sees. It was very painful to see.' Small victories For the children’s families, their presence is a ray of light amid the darkness. Many families lost loved ones in the October 7 massacre. Some fathers remain in captivity, while others have parents or family members who were abducted and later released or who survived the massacre but lost other relatives. Amid this complex reality, with additional children in the family and parents facing their own trauma, the volunteers are a constant they can hold onto. 'They’re so grateful for the help we provide their children,' Ruti says. 'Even amid their overwhelming challenges, they always find time to say thank you. You can feel how much they appreciate us. Families with relatives still in captivity even take time to express their gratitude. They open their doors to us which is no small thing.' Amid this enormous challenge, Ruti and Lior look for small victories. Sometimes it’s a smile that wasn’t there yesterday, other times it’s a game that lasts a little longer than usual. One story that left a mark on them is of a boy who returned from captivity. 'He was withdrawn at first, afraid to leave the house,' Lior recalls. 'When we first visited him, he was shocked that we came just for him. Now, he eagerly awaits our visits. It might seem like a small change, but it’s everything for us.' The fact that hostages remain in Gaza makes recovery even harder. 'It rattles everyone,' says Ruti. 'Some of them still have family members in captivity so they can’t fully heal. But we see the small victories — a child who smiles more, a teenager who dares to step outside, a family starting to talk about the future. That gives us hope.' The work with children who survived captivity is an enormous emotional challenge, even for the young volunteers. They hear harrowing stories, witness deep pain and sometimes the line between caregiver and patient blurs. 'It affects us deeply,' Ruti admits, 'but not during the meetings. Sometimes, it all surfaces afterward. We live with this 24/7, but we don’t let it in during the sessions.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The young women themselves receive regular psychological support. They share an apartment with two other national service volunteers who also work with children who survived captivity, which may be their greatest source of strength. 'We have to take care of ourselves to keep helping,' Ruti says. 'Living together helps us hold on. We understand each other without words.' In a few months, their service will end, but the children’s journey back to life is far from over. 'A few days ago, a mother told us, ‘We’re able to keep going because of you,’' Lior shares. 'These words give us the strength to keep going, even when it’s hard.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/ry00ix2fp1l	2025-01-13T10:25:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/08/B1MfCGS38yg/B1MfCGS38yg_0_452_1200_675_0_small.jpg
IDF deploys 162nd Division to Beit Hanoun amid Gaza offensive	Decision follows intense combat in northern Gaza, where IDF forces managed to overrun one of Hamas' remaining battalions early in the war Following the intensified fighting in Gaza’s Beit Hanoun, which resulted in the death of 10 Israeli soldiers, the IDF has decided to transfer responsibility for the area from the 143rd 'Gaza' Division to the 162nd Division, currently engaged in operations in the neighboring town of Jabaliya. Senior military officials acknowledged errors in the initial division of sectors within the Gaza Strip, where the division was tasked with handling Beit Hanoun alongside the buffer zone along the border, Rafah and the Philadelphi Corridor. The 162nd Division will receive reinforcements to concentrate efforts against Hamas' Beit Hanoun Battalion. The battalion, previously regarded as one of the weaker units within the terror organization, was easily overrun by the 162nd Division at the start of the war and later by the 252nd Reserve Division. However, the battalion's operatives have since adapted, now engaging in guerrilla warfare that has claimed the lives of 10 IDF soldiers since the 143rd Division launched a brigade-level operation to clear the town in the past two weeks. This comes while the IDF is stretched thin, operating simultaneously in Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank, the Jordanian border and Gaza. All fronts are active, with forces operating beyond the border fences in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza. The military urgently requires additional standing forces and is currently calling up approximately 70,000 more reservists, though this remains insufficient given the extensive challenges. Over the weekend, the IDF reported four Nahal Brigade soldiers were killed by a powerful explosive device while traveling along a road in Beit Hanoun that was supposed to be fully cleared and secured. According to an initial investigation, a Hamas terrorist cell took advantage of stormy weather last week to plant an explosive alongside a military logistics route in Beit Hanoun. Such routes are typically secured early in large-scale operations, serving as logistical pathways once cleared of enemy presence and under constant security. Although the route was deemed secure, the terrorists managed to emerge unnoticed—possibly from a previously undiscovered tunnel—plant the device and remotely detonate it. A day earlier, eight soldiers were injured in various degrees in an explosion in Jabaliya. Troops in Beit Hanoun have uncovered over 30 explosive devices over the last two weeks. However, when devices go undetected, as in recent incidents, the toll has been devastating. The explosive detonated on Saturday was standard-issue and linked to Hamas. In another severe incident last week, where three soldiers were killed in another blast, the explosive is believed to have contained unexploded IDF ordnance found by terrorists, a recurring concern. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The remaining terrorists are also turning the rubble of destroyed buildings to their advantage. Exploiting the extensive destruction and the assumption by forces that bombed or demolished buildings are free of enemy presence, they use the ruins as cover to advance and launch attacks. Forces in Beit Hanoun are now required to learn from each incident, advancing more cautiously and meticulously searching for signs of hidden explosives during their offensives. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1s1006mdjl	2025-01-13T10:14:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/Syx00q3zWD1x/Syx00q3zWD1x_1_167_1601_901_0_small.jpg
Israel releases 2024 terrorism report: 1,866 terror acts, 134 kil...	Annual report reveals 16,300 rockets fired at Israel, causing 55 deaths and 699 injuries; 399 hostile aircraft incursions and 132 shooting attacks documented The National Information Directorate in the Prime Minister’s Office published its 2024 summary report on terrorism Monday, detailing a year of significant violence that left 134 people dead and 1,277 injured. The report documented attacks originating from seven fronts: Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, Iraq, Yemen and the West Bank. The report found that 41 fatalities resulted from shooting attacks, including 13 hostages murdered in Hamas captivity. Nine individuals were killed in stabbing incidents, and six in vehicle-ramming attacks. The year saw 132 shooting attacks, leaving 108 injured, including 23 with severe injuries. In 41 stabbing attacks, 28 were wounded, while 26 vehicle-ramming incidents caused 86 injuries. The year marked a surge in rocket fire, with approximately 15,400 rockets fired from Lebanon and 700 from Gaza, leading to 55 deaths and 699 injuries. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: October was the deadliest month, with over 6,900 rockets launched during intense fighting with Hezbollah. According to the report, there were 399 hostile aircraft incursions, 1,246 stone-throwing incidents, 89 bomb placements and 140 firebombings. Over 610 fires caused by rockets and drones scorched over 92,000 acres, including 55,000 acres in northern Israel. The deadliest month was October, which saw 37 fatalities and 294 injuries, followed by July with 22 deaths and 96 injuries; and August with 20 deaths and 71 injuries. Compiled with data from the IDF, Shin Bet, Israel Police and other agencies, the report consolidates information on attacks within Israel’s borders. Unlike the Shin Bet’s report, which includes thwarted attacks, this report focuses solely on executed attacks. It is distributed to Israeli public diplomacy bodies for international advocacy and legitimacy-building efforts. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjuj8tfdkl	2025-01-13T09:59:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/rJc7k958yg/rJc7k958yg_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Why is a Christian mother of six risking it all to stand with Isr...	Rev. Hayley Ace is in Israel on a solidarity mission. She says: ‘If Israel fails, the West will fail’ Rev. Hayley Ace has been threatened by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hamas agents in London. She has been harassed on the street for wearing a Jewish star necklace—though she is not Jewish—and attacked on social media for standing up for Israel. Despite these threats, Ace, a mother of six living in London, arrived in Israel last week to stand in solidarity with the Jewish people. 'I think my faith is a huge factor,' Ace told ILTV News. 'I trust God with my life and safety, and I feel like I am doing God’s work.' While she acknowledged taking necessary precautions, she said her faith gives her the strength to continue, knowing that what she is doing is 'really important.' 'Fear should never be a reason to stop us from doing what is right,' Ace continued. 'Remember, there are almost 100 hostages held underground in the hands of terrorists. If we cannot be bold for them, we fail them… We have to be brave.' Read related stories: What do Christian Zionists need to do to support Israel? Christian Zionists defy war to stand with Israel at Feast of Tabernacles Holy Land exodus: Why Bethlehem’s Christians are vanishing Ace is one of London’s most well-known Christian activists for Israel. She is the founder of Christian Action Against Antisemitism and was named among the 50 Christian Allies for Israel last year. Ace arrived in Israel on Thursday to create content aimed at fighting the propaganda war and inspiring her network of Christians—what she calls the 'silent majority.' She will remain in Israel until the 20th. This is her second trip; her first visit was part of an influencers’ trip organized by the World Zionist Organization last year. However, that trip was just five days long and focused primarily on touring the destruction in Israel’s south so participants could bear witness. This time, her itinerary is packed. It includes visits to war-affected sites, meetings with Israeli political and military leaders, encouraging soldiers on army bases, and exploring the Old City and other Christian sites significant to her faith. On Thursday, Ace spent the day with 9-year-old Ben Carasso, the 'Spokeskid of Israel.' Following the events of October 7, Ben felt compelled to help his country by sharing Israel’s story with the world through the eyes of a child. Over the past 16 months, Ben has appeared on various media channels, speaking fluent English to explain what being a kid in Israel is like. He shares experiences such as what goes through a child’s mind during a rocket attack and how families adapt their daily routines during wartime. Ben also has friends who have lost loved ones in border communities, relatives who were kidnapped, and family members serving in the army reserves. Ace discovered Ben’s videos and invited him to London last year. Together, they hung posters of the hostages across the city alongside a Muslim pro-Israel influencer and created content to raise awareness. Ben described Ace as 'amazing' in his interview with ILTV News. 'To see people like Hayley come to Israel and help us—there are no words to explain such things,' Ben said. He acknowledged that it has become increasingly challenging for supporters to stand up for Israel due to the loud anti-Zionist rhetoric. However, people like Ace make a meaningful difference. Ben added that it was inspiring to see Israel through Ace’s perspective. He explained that many people label Israel as an apartheid or colonial state, but walking through the Old City with Ace, she witnessed Israel’s diversity with her own eyes. Ace explained that her support for Israel is 'multi-layered.' First, she has a strong sense of justice and cannot stand bullying and slander, which she believes the world is directing toward Israel. Second, she is originally from New Zealand and a member of the Maori Christian sect. Therefore, she understands what it means to be an indigenous people. 'The Jewish people are the indigenous people of Israel, and I want to stand with them,' she said. Finally, she pointed to her religious convictions, noting that God gave the Jewish people an everlasting covenant to live in Israel. As a devout Christian, she said she believes in the Bible and God, emphasizing that 'everlasting means everlasting.' Ace believes that Israel is fighting a war for humanity. 'If Israel fails, the West will fail,' Ace told ILTV News. 'Israel is fighting an evil that wants to target everyone who does not agree with their ideology of radical Islam.' She added, 'Anyone who loves freedom, who stands for feminism, who stands with the LGBTQI+ community, who stands for goodness and decency should be standing with Israel.' Ace also highlighted Israel’s unique position as the safest place for Christians in the Middle East. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, there are 180,300 Christian citizens in Israel, comprising about 1.8% of the population. Over the past year, the Christian community has grown by 0.6%. In contrast, a recent report from the Jerusalem Center for Strategic and Foreign Affairs revealed a sharp decline in the Christian population in Palestinian Authority-controlled areas, attributing the decrease to violence, weak law enforcement, and religious coercion. In 1922, Christians made up 11% of the population in these regions. Today, they account for less than 1%. In Gaza, the Christian population has dropped from 5,000 before Hamas seized power in 2007 to just 1,000 as of October 2023. Bethlehem reflects these troubling trends. In 1950, Christians made up 86% of the population in Bethlehem and its surrounding villages. Today, that number has dwindled to approximately 10%. 'I feel I have been positioned to be a voice of truth to fight against the lies,' Ace said. 'I came here to create content to counter all of those slanderous lies, like occupation, apartheid, genocide.' Ace’s visit is also about solidarity. 'I want the people of Israel to know that there are those of us in the world who see exactly what is going on and truly love you and stand with you,' Ace added. 'We want to stand in front of you and say, ‘If they come for the Jews, they have to go through us first.’'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1yb4kbwje	2025-01-13T09:26:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/r1H8Iy11Pke/r1H8Iy11Pke_0_667_1200_676_0_small.jpg

Anti-Israel group seeks arrest of top Israeli general in Italy	Hind Rajab Foundation files ICC arrest request for Major General Ghassan Alian for alleged weaponization of famine in Gaza The Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF), known for its legal campaigns against IDF soldiers abroad, has filed an arrest request in Italy against IDF Major General Ghassan Alian, Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT). The foundation alleges Alian is in Italy 'secretly' and claims this marks the first time it has targeted an Israeli general of his rank with such legal action. Dyab Abou Jahjah, founder and leader of HRF, revealed on the television program Democracy Now that the organization has filed a case in the International Criminal Court (ICC) against Alian. 'We have filed a case against him at the ICC, asking for any existing arrest warrant to be activated or for a new one to be issued,' Abou Jahjah said. 'We also informed Italian authorities, urging them to fulfill their obligations under their own statute since they have jurisdiction and Alian does not possess immunity.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The HRF has accused Alian of overseeing policies they describe as war crimes and crimes against humanity, including the blockade of Gaza and targeting civilian infrastructure. The organization claims these actions amount to genocide, citing a total embargo on essential goods and alleged destruction of hospitals and other civilian facilities. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the HRF wrote, 'Major General Ghassan Alian, head of COGAT, is currently in Rome. Alian oversaw the total blockade of Gaza, weaponizing famine and targeting civilian infrastructure in acts amounting to genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.' The group further accused Alian of 'publicly dehumanizing Palestinians as 'human animals,' reflecting the intent behind his policies.' The HRF stated that Italy, as a signatory to the ICC's Rome Statute, is obligated to act immediately to detain Alian. 'With no immunity under international law, Italy must take swift action,' the group said, adding that the ICC has issued arrest warrants in the past for similar allegations against Israeli officials. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkkagampke	2025-01-13T08:31:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/02/15/ByEFdLOsjT/ByEFdLOsjT_0_0_1300_731_0_small.jpg

Russia and Iran to sign strategic partnership pact on Jan. 17, Kr...	Iranian officials reportedly making clandestine trips to Moscow seeking Russian help with Islamic Republic's nuclear program as negotiations with West may resume Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian will hold talks in Russia on Jan. 17 after which they will sign a long-awaited comprehensive strategic partnership pact, the Kremlin said on Monday. The agreement comes as the Islamic Republic nears a breakthrough point to becoming a nuclear state. In its announcement, the Kremlin said the two leaders will discuss options for further expanding ties between Moscow and Tehran, including in the trade and investment, transport and logistics, and humanitarian spheres. Putin and Pezeshkian will also talk about regional and international issues, it added. Russia's announcement comes hours after a report appeared in the London Times about Iranian officials traveling on diplomatic missions to Russia to bolster its military capabilities. According to the report, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's close advisor Ali Larijani held secret trips to Moscow to meet with senior officials there in an effort to secure Russia's help for Iran's nuclear program and for its aerial defenses, after having been damaged in the Israeli attacks late last year. According to the Times, Western intelligence sources said Tehran was requesting Russian assistance in matters related to its nuclear program after years of cooperation that included the supply to Iran of nuclear fuel for a 1,000-megawatt light-water nuclear power reactor. One source said that since Russia was dependent on Iranian drones in its war on Ukraine, there was concern that it would be willing to cross red lines, previously observed, regarding Iran's nuclear ambitions. The Times report comes as Iran was preparing to resume negotiations with the so-called E3 group - the UK, Germany and France in Geneva, to reach a new nuclear deal. One such meeting was scheduled for Monday and the paper said that its revelation of the secret meetings held by Iranians and Russians, would likely raise more concern over Iran's real intentions, in the West. Russia has cultivated closer ties with Iran and other countries hostile towards the U.S., such as North Korea, since the start of the Ukraine war. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in October that Moscow and Tehran intended to sign the strategic partnership pact which would include closer defense cooperation. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The United States accused Tehran in September of delivering close-range ballistic missiles to Russia for use against Ukraine, and imposed sanctions on ships and companies it said were involved in delivering Iranian weapons.

Iran announced on Monday that it has received a new shipment of 1,000 UAVs, in what can be considered a signal to Israel and the United States should they be considering an attack on its nuclear facilities after U.S. president-elect Trump takes office. The Iranian Tasnim news agency said the drones have been deployed to different sites around the country. They have the capability of traveling to a distance of over 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles) and cause severe damage. They have the ability of autonomous flight and can penetrate advanced defense systems and will not only increase Iran's ability to defend its borders but also attack targets at a great distance. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hko5iqgdyg	2025-01-13T05:54:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/11/H1xMHJ5UJkx/H1xMHJ5UJkx_0_179_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Our prisoners freedom is near,' Hamas says; members of coalition...	The terror group confirmed for the first time that progress had been made in hostage deal talks; first phase to release 33 hostages for a six-week Gaza ceasefire and 1,000 Palestinian prisoners; Lapid offers PM safety net against opposition in government Hamas confirmed on Monday that there was significant progress in negotiations with Israel. 'The freedom of our heroic prisoners is near.' The terror group also called on Palestinians to escalate confrontations with Israel, citing 'increasing crimes against our people, our holy sites, and our prisoners,' a spokesperson for the military wing of the terror group said. After reports that a deal was nearing completion, members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition voiced their opposition to any deal that would include the withdrawal of troops from Gaza and the release of hardened terrorists from Israeli jails. In a letter to Netanyahu, coalition law makers and parents from the right-wing group of families of hostages said they had serious concerns over Israel's security in case a deal is agreed. They demanded that IDF troops remain in Gaza including in Rafah and the Netzarim Corridor, displaced Gazans not be allowed to return to the northern parts of the Strip and that all hostages be returned in one phase. Earlier Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said in a post on X that the pending agreement would be catastrophic for Israel's national security. 'We will not be part of a capitulation deal that would include the release of arch-terrorists, stop the war and dissolve its achievement won in blood, while sacrificing the lives of many hostages,' he said in his post. 'This is the time to continue in full force, conquer and purify the entire Strip and finally take control of the humanitarian aid from Hamas and open the gates of hell until Hamas is defeated and all the hostages returned.' Support for a deal came from the Ultra-Orthodox Agudath Israel movement part of the United Torah Judaism faction in Netanyahu's coalition. They called on the prime minister to disregard political considerations and agree to a cease-fire deal. 'It is an undisputed moral and national duty to return the hostages home,' they said. Opposition leader Yair Lapid said he would provide Netanyahu with a safety net of support needed to agree to the deal. Lapid said he was told by a Qatari official that Hamas was keen for an agreement. 'I told Netanyahu my offer of votes, holds and he does not need Ben-Gvir and Smotrich to agree to it.' According to reports, the proposed deal's first phase would involve the release of 33 hostages in exchange for a six-week ceasefire in Gaza and the release of approximately 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. This group reportedly includes 48 individuals re-arrested after being released in the 2011 Shalit deal, 90 women, 150 to 200 prisoners serving life sentences, about 350 minors under 19, and around 560 elderly and ill detainees. Additional terms of the first phase reportedly under discussion include: Providing Israel with a list of living hostages. Relocating Israeli forces outside populated areas in Gaza. Allowing displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, subject to third-party vehicle inspections. Reopening the Rafah crossing for humanitarian aid and permitting the exit of patients for medical treatment. The deal's second phase would commence a week after the first phase is implemented, with the release of remaining hostages in exchange for a negotiated number of Palestinian prisoners and a second six-week ceasefire. Negotiators would also address broader arrangements aimed at ending the war and facilitating an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. If an agreement is reached on the second phase, the third phase will focus on rebuilding Gaza and establishing its governance framework. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sources close to the negotiations emphasized the complexity of the process, noting that talks encompass all 98 hostages held by Hamas and other factions. 'The first phase is naturally the focus as it sets everything in motion,' one source said. 'Efforts are being made to maximize the number of hostages released alive.' Key issues still under discussion include the situation in northern Gaza, the Philadelphi Route, and the security perimeter. Decisions about the fate of high-profile prisoners—whether they will return home or be exiled to a third country—also remain unresolved. 'The hostages' condition is a critical factor,' one insider explained. 'Achieving a deal hinges on resolving these outstanding issues.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkdsdymdke	2025-01-13T04:32:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/03/H10EohEh0/H10EohEh0_0_5_1417_798_0_small.jpg

Tanker hit by Houthis salvaged, Red Sea disaster averted	A risky operation to salvage an oil tanker attacked by Houthi terrorists in the Red Sea and avert what could have been one of the largest oil spills in recorded history has been completed, British maritime security company Ambrey and Greece have said. The 900-foot Greek-registered MT Sounion, carrying 150,000 tonnes of crude oil, was struck by several missiles and drones and caught fire on Aug. 21, triggering fears of an oil spill that could cause catastrophic environmental damage in the area. Months later, the vessel has been declared safe and its cargo has been removed, said Ambrey, which led the salvage operation. In mid-September, Sounion, which was hit 58 miles off the Yemeni coast, was towed to a safe location 150 miles to the north by a flotilla of seven salvage vessels escorted by the European Union's naval force Aspides. Extinguishing the fires on board took three weeks in difficult climate conditions, Ambrey said, and the vessel was later towed north to Suez for her cargo to be removed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk1g00umv1e	2025-01-13T02:26:01-08:00

Eliyahu Revivo of Netanyahu's ruling Likud party reacts during Knesset committee meeting to the father of a hostage who says the prime minister should be arrested by the ICC for crimes against his own people as well 'If you go on like this, you will ensure your son remains in Hamas dungeons for years,' A father of one of the hostages held in Gaza was told on Monday, by a member of the ruling coalition. Eliyahu Revivo, a lawmaker from Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party and a member of the Knesset Constitution, Law, Justice Committee shouted at Yehuda Cohen, whose son Nimrod was abducted to Gaza during the Hamas massacre on Oct. 7, after he said Netanyahu should be arrested by the International Criminal Court (ICC) not only for crimes against Gazans but for his crimes against IDF soldiers. Cohen said that if the threat of arrest would push the prime minister toward accepting a hostage release deal, he would recommend it. Revivo then turned his ire at a relative of slain hostage Carmel Gat who told him to stop yelling at a father of a hostage. 'Who do you think you are?' Revivo asked. Cohen warned of the government once again foiling the chance for a hostage release deal and opting for a 'murderous ideology, such as settlements and the killing of soldiers' over saving lives. 'Rather than sanctifying life, they are sanctifying death,' he said. 'We heard what [Finance Minister Bezalel] Smotrich said.

Biden officials who resigned over administration support for Isra...	13 officials from the State Department, the White House, and the U.S. military have so far resigned; In interviews some reveal the extent of American support to Israel after October 7 in terms of weapon deliveries, claiming to have been silenced by top brass The prestigious American news magazine '60 Minutes' devoted an episode on Sunday evening to the several resignations in the U.S. State Department in protest of the Biden administration's support for Israel's war in Gaza. According to the investigation, since the beginning of the war a record number of formal reservation requests have been submitted, a tool created during the Vietnam War to allow employees to express opposition to government policy. A total of 13 officials from the State Department, the White House, and the U.S. military have resigned in protest over the government's support for Israel. Hala Rharrit, an ex-diplomat who quit in protest shared her story. 'I would show images of children that were starved to death,' she said. 'In one incident, I was basically berated, 'Don't put that image in there. We don't want to see it. We don't want to see that the children are starving to death.' She said the U.S. had become a target in the Arab world due to its support for Israel since the October 7 massacre. According to Rharrit, who served in the State Department for two decades, when she presented harsh images of children affected by bombs in department reports, she was met with fierce opposition from senior colleagues: 'I would show the complicity that was indisputable. Fragments of U.S. bombs next to massacres of mostly children. And that's the devastation,' she told the camera, reliving moments that broke her. Ultimately, she was told that her reports were no longer needed, and she resigned from her position in public protest. Andrew Miller, who served as deputy assistant secretary of state for Israel-Palestinian affairs, also spoke out publicly against American policy, but chose to do so after his resignation last June. Miller, who was considered the most senior member of the Biden administration to resign and criticize support for Israel, said that there were no clear red lines for the IDF's use of American weapons. According to Miller, the message conveyed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from the Biden administration was that he was the one in the driver's seat, that American support would always be there, and that he could take it for granted. Miller also said that Biden refrained from setting clear limits for Netanyahu, beyond a general call for compliance with international law. 'There were general expectations, but no specific red lines were given beyond the usual language of compliance with international law,' he noted. Miller criticized the use of the 2,000-pound (908 kg) American bombs which led to numerous civilian casualties. He questioned Israel's alleged use of these bombs to target one or two people in densely populated areas. While he says it is reasonable to assume that Israel used American weapons in violation of international law during its operations in Gaza, he states there was no evidence that Israel was committing genocide. He also said the reports' findings were biased because the Americans rely on Israel to get information from the ground. He added that although the U.S. believes that Israel acted inappropriately, it has gained the benefit of the doubt because Americans hold respect for the IDF's reports. Another interviewee on the show, Josh Paul, who served as a State Department administrator and signed off on major arms deals, pointed to the direct connection between the Israeli Air Force's attacks and the American arms industry. 'There is a linkage between every single bomb that is dropped in Gaza and the U.S. because every single bomb that is dropped is dropped from an American-made plane,' he said. Paul, who resigned 10 days after the war began. He described an atmosphere in which there was no room for debate or discussion, and that decisions to transfer weapons to Israel were made with explicit instructions from the highest levels of the White House. He claimed there was no room for discussion. 'This came from the president, from the secretary and from those around them,'' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The White House declined to comment directly on the investigation, but senior administration officials said the policy was designed to prevent a wider war in the Middle East.

Qatar delivers 'final draft' of hostage deal to Israel, Israeli o...	Finance Minister Smotrich says pending agreement is catastrophic for Israel's security, a capitulation that he could not support; official says Israel negotiating for the release of all 98 hostages and working to maximize the number of live captives in 1st phase Mediator Qatar has handed Israel and Hamas a 'final' draft of a cease-fire and hostage release agreement designed to end the war in Gaza, an official briefed on the negotiations told Reuters on Monday. A breakthrough was reached in Doha after midnight following talks between Israel's spy chiefs, President-elect Trump's Middle East envoy and Qatar’s prime minister, the official said. Officials in Israel denied receiving the draft and said the final agreement is dependent on Hamas. 'we are very close to a deal but it is all in the hands of Hamas,' an official said. Sources with knowledge of the details of the deal said there are a number of outstanding matters that could determine whether an agreement is reached. 'It is to do with the situation in northern Gaza, the Philadelphi corridor, the mile wide stretch along the border and the question of how many prisoners are released and who had veto power over that, including the release of convicted murderers and whether they would return home or be exiled,' according to a source. The sources said the condition of the hostages is above all considerations. 'The negotiations are about all 98 hostages held by Hamas and the other Gaza factions. The first phase of the deal is in the spotlight for obvious reasons because that is the beginning of the entire process and agreement on that is near but the negotiations are over all of them, without exception,' a source said. 'The first phase will include the release of 33 hostages and there is a massive effort to maximize the number of live hostages in that group.' Meanwhile, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he could not support the deal. In a post on X he said the pending agreement is catastrophic for Israel's security. We will not be part of a capitulation deal that would include the release of arch-terrorists, stop the war and dissolve its achievement won in blood while sacrificing the lives of many hostages,' he said in his post. 'This is the time to continue in full force, conquer and purify the entire Strip and finally take control of the humanitarian aid from Hamas and open the gates of hell until Hamas is defeated and all the hostages returned.' Earlier, a Palestinian Authority source told Ynet on Monday morning that Qadura Fares, head of the Palestinian Prisoners Affairs Committee, who is responsible, among other things, for the issue of terrorists held in Israeli prisons, 'went to Qatar to meet with the negotiating team and prepare the list of Palestinian prisoners who will be released as part of a hostage deal.' Fares claimed Sunday that more than 3,000 Palestinian prisoners will be released in the first phase of the deal. This could be indication of further progress in the talks to secure a cease-fire and hostage release deal. The Israeli delegation to the talks, including Mossad Chief David Barnea, Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar and IDF representative Major General Nitzan Alon, remained in Qatar, where negotiations were underway with the participation of U.S. President Joe Biden's envoy Brett McGurk and Steve Witkoff, who is president-elect Donald Trump's Mideast envoy. Biden spoke to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday just eight days before the U.S. president is set to leave office. The two leaders discussed the efforts underway to reach a deal to halt the fighting in the Palestinian enclave and free the remaining hostages there, the White House said in a statement. The Prime Minister's Office said after the call that Netanyahu briefed the president on the mandate given to the Israeli delegation to advance the release of hostages. U.S. Vice President-elect JD Vance told Fox News Sunday in an interview taped on Saturday that he expects a deal for the release of U.S. hostages in the Middle East to be announced in the final days of the Biden administration, maybe in the last day or two. The talks in Qatar are being held under media silence but, according to a report in the Saudi Arabian Alhadath channel, one of the main outstanding questions is to where some of the Palestinians prisoners that would be freed in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages would be exiled. Turkey and Qatar have been raised as possibilities but there were previous reports that Iran could also be an option, although it was not currently mentioned, according to the Saudi report. The Asharq channel in Saudi Arabia said the deal being advanced is based on the May 27 proposal and would include three stages. In the first stage 34 hostages would be released in exchange for a six-week cease-fire and 1,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. According to the sources quoted in the report, among them are 48 prisoners who were previously freed in the 2011 deal to release IDF soldier Gilad Shalit and were arrested again, 90 women, 150 to 200 convicted terrorists who had been sentenced to life in prison and 560 elderly or sick prisoners. Outstanding questions in the first stage are the identity of the hostages that would be released from captivity, the withdrawal of IDF forces from populated areas, the return of displaced Gaza residents to areas they evacuated - after inspection by a third party, reopening of the Rafah border crossing to allow humanitarian aid deliveries, and removal of sick people and humanitarian cases for medical treatment outside Gaza. The second phase would begin one week after the first and would include the release of the remaining hostages in exchange for an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners and a second six-week cease-fire. At this stage, negotiations would begin on the end of the war and an IDF withdrawal of troops. According to the sources, the third phase would be negotiated if the second phase is agreed and that would include the rebuilding of the Gaza Strip and how it would be governed.

Knesset to approve 1 billion shekels for massacre victims, but it...	Some families will still fall through the cracks: Mother of Nova survivor says she is supporting her son who cannot hold a job but is not due to receive any government assistance; Head of NGO assisting families: 'It is a moral duty,' to provide adequate funds The Knesset Labor and Welfare Committee is expected on Monday to approve 1 billion shekel to fund assistance to victims of the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre. The final agreement offers a one-time sum ranging from 7,180 shekels to 28,720 shekels, based on certain criteria and a refund of rehabilitation costs totaling up to 30,000 shekels. Members of family of survivors who were witness to the events, most residents of the city of Ofakim, and adults whose parents were killed in the massacre could fall through the cracks and receive very little or no compensation. The existing law does not recognize family members who were witness to the massacre by phone or text or those who were already recognized as victims of terror attacks. The funds allotted to cover the needs of those impacted by the massacre are insufficient to cover the costs of medical and emotional rehabilitation and care. Osnat Hasson, the mother of Nova survivor Elad who represented the parents of survivors of the festival, said she is not eligible for government funds despite the support she has been giving her son. 'I cannot work full time, and most of the parents of survivors are in the same position,' she said. 'My son now depends on me and cannot hold down a job.' She said the government should take responsibility and recognize her family and others like it as victims and provide a respectable and adequate response. > Efrat Eton, who heads the 'Secure Heart' non-profit, has been providing emotional support for Nova survivors and their families. She said the government has caused fights among families that were impacted instead of learning the different needs and providing appropriate responses. 'It is wrong that some survivors who want to rehabilitate would be given disability compensation while others who witnessed their loved ones' trauma and have been providing them with support, are ignored,' she said. 'This is a moral duty and in the national interest.' Residents of Ofakim, living in the quarter that was overrun by the terrorists on Oct. 7 were allotted only a few thousand shekels. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk8jx4zwjl	2025-01-12T23:14:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/11/rklRO1h6vR/rklRO1h6vR_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg
As deal seems ever closer, head of Palestinian prisoners affairs ...	Qadura Fares, head of the Palestinian Prisoners Affairs Committee, to prepare the list of Palestinian prisoners to be released if a cease-fire an hostage release deal is reached; Claims 3,000 would be freed from Israeli jail in the first phase A Palestinian Authority source told Ynet on Monday morning that Qadura Fares, head of the Palestinian Prisoners Affairs Committee, who is responsible, among other things, for the issue of terrorists held in Israeli prisons, 'went to Qatar to meet with the negotiating team and prepare the list of Palestinian prisoners who will be released as part of a hostage deal.' Fares claimed Sunday that more than 3,000 Palestinian prisoners will be released in the first phase of the deal. This could be indication of further progress in the talks to secure a cease-fire and hostage release deal. The Israeli delegation to the talks, including Mossad Chief David Barnea, Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar and IDF representative Major General Nitzan Alon, remained in Qatar, where negotiations were underway with the participation of U.S. President Joe Biden's envoy Brett McGurk and Steve Witkoff, who is president-elect Donald Trump's Mideast envoy. Biden spoke to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday just eight days before the U.S. president is set to leave office. The two leaders discussed the efforts underway to reach a deal to halt the fighting in the Palestinian enclave and free the remaining hostages there, the White House said in a statement. The Prime Minister's Office said after the call that Netanyahu briefed the president on the mandate given to the Israeli delegation to advance the release of hostages. U.S. Vice President-elect JD Vance told Fox News Sunday in an interview taped on Saturday that he expects a deal for the release of U.S. hostages in the Middle East to be announced in the final days of the Biden administration, maybe in the last day or two. The talks in Qatar are being held under media silence but, according to a report in the Saudi Arabian Alhadath channel, one of the main outstanding questions is to where some of the Palestinians prisoners that would be freed in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages would be exiled. Turkey and Qatar have been raised as possibilities but there were previous reports that Iran could also be an option, although it was not currently mentioned, according to the Saudi report. The Asharq channel in Saudi Arabia said the deal being advanced is based on the May 27 proposal and would include three stages. In the first stage 34 hostages would be released in exchange for a six-week cease-fire and 1,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.

Is the war against Hamas in Gaza over?	Dr. Gerald Steinberg says some argue Israel could agree to a ceasefire now and still respond later The war against Hamas in Gaza is far from over, according to Dr. Gerald Steinberg, CEO of NGO Monitor. Speaking to ILTV, Steinberg noted that the recent casualties in Gaza demonstrate that Hamas still has significant ground-fighting capabilities. This, he explained, complicates any potential ceasefire-for-hostage deal aimed at ending the war. However, Steinberg acknowledged that some argue Israel could agree to a ceasefire now and still respond later if new weapons are uncovered or Hamas carries out further attacks. 'There are going to be a lot of questions about the details of any deal,' Steinberg said. He emphasized the importance of U.S. pressure on Qatar to cease funding Hamas as part of any ceasefire agreement. If that pressure is successful, Steinberg said, 'we’ll get a deal.'

Mideast expert: Iran cares less about the Houthis	Benny Sabti says the Houthis operate independently and are a low priority for the Iranian regime The Iranian regime does not prioritize the Houthis, according to Benny Sabti, an Iranian researcher for the INSS. Speaking to ILTV, Sabti explained that Iran cares less about the Houthis compared to its other proxies. While the regime has supplied the Houthis with weapons for many years, it largely trusts them to operate independently, without Iranian interference. 'It’s not like Hezbollah or the Iraqis, or maybe even the Syrian regime or proxies that they interfere with all the time,' Sabti said. 'The Houthis are so far away that they also care less about them.' Sabti added that any strikes involving the Houthis—whether they are launched toward Israel or target the Houthis themselves—ultimately serve Iran's interests. 'It’s just a good and positive point for Iran. The more we are occupied with the Houthis, it’s good for Iranians,' he said.

24 dead and rising: Wildfires continue to rage through Los Angele...	More than 12,000 buildings have been destroyed and the fire has spread across about 160 square kilometers; About 150,000 remain evacuated from their homes, and the outlook for the future is worrying: Strong winds will resume this week, making firefighting operations more difficult The death toll from the massive wildfires raging in and around Los Angeles has risen to 24, with at least 16 others still missing. According to the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office, eight people were killed in the devastated Pacific Palisades neighborhood and 16 in the Eaton neighborhood. Authorities expect the death toll to rise as the search continues. Officials said they expected that figure to increase as teams with cadaver dogs conduct systematic grid searches in leveled neighborhoods. Authorities have established a center where people can report the missing. The fires, which spread over more than 160 square kilometers, have destroyed more than 12,000 structures, including homes and apartments, and have also damaged vehicles. The disaster affects a region of about 13 million residents, with about 150,000 still under evacuation orders. Officials said last night that most evacuation orders will not be lifted until high wind warnings are removed. In addition to the evacuees, tens of thousands of California residents are experiencing power outages due to the fire. The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings for severe fire conditions through Wednesday, with sustained winds of 50 mph (80 kph) and gusts in the mountains reaching 70 mph (113 kph). The most dangerous day will be Tuesday, said weather service meteorologist Rich Thompson. Fire fighting crews from California and nine other states are part of the ongoing response that includes nearly 1,400 fire engines, 84 aircraft and more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from Mexico. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky proposed sending firefighters to Los Angeles on Sunday night, instructing the country's interior minister to 'prepare for the possible participation of Ukrainian rescuers in the fight against the fires in California.' In a video posted by Zelensky, he said that 'the situation there is extremely difficult, and Ukrainians can help Americans save lives.' He later added that '150 firefighters are already ready.' The fire broke out nearly a week ago on Tuesday, and despite relatively calm winds that have allowed firefighters to begin to gain control of the fires in recent days, the outlook for the future is worrying and predicts a resumption of strong winds during the week, in an area that has not seen rain in more than eight months. According to estimates, the fires in Los Angeles are already among the most expensive in U.S. history, and the investment bank J.P. Morgan estimates the economic damage at about $50 billion . AccuWeather, a private company that provides data on the weather and its impact, predicts that the economic damage could reach $135-$150 billion. The investigation into the incident revealed serious failures in emergency infrastructure. California Governor Gavin Newsom ordered an independent investigation to understand why a 10-million-gallon water reservoir was shut down and many fire hydrants were not working. 'This is very disturbing,' he said. 'We need answers to ensure that this never happens again and that all resources are available to us to fight these catastrophic fires.' Los Angeles Fire Chief Christine Crowley sharply criticized the city’s leadership, alleging a lack of funding for the firefighting system. 'When a firefighter goes to a hydrant, we expect there to be water there,' she said. The flames consumed schools, churches, a synagogue, libraries, bars, restaurants, banks and historic sites, as well as Will Rogers' Western Farmhouse and another historic mansion built in 1887. The Walt Disney Company announced a $15 million donation to recovery and relief efforts. California fire officials say the cause of the fires remains unclear and that an active investigation is underway, but U.S. media reported last week that arson investigators are involved in the investigation of the fire in the Palisades neighborhood, which was the first in a wave of fires and caused enormous destruction. It is already being described as one of the largest natural disasters in Los Angeles history. The pictures from Los Angeles speak for themselves. Where the homes of celebrities and movie stars once stood, what is now mostly visible are ruined buildings, burned trees jutting out from the rubble, and isolated mansions left exposed on all sides. The Pacific Palisades neighborhood has been used extensively for filming movies and television shows. The neighborhood, which was established about 100 years ago as a religious commune, quickly became highly sought-after due to its beauty and proximity to nature - a long stretch of coastline, rugged cliffs and green valleys - as well as to the city center. The average price of a house there was $4.6 million. Among the buildings demolished in the upscale neighborhood were the homes of celebrities such as Billy Crystal, Jeff Bridges and Paris Hilton. Palisades High School, which appeared in films such as 'Carrie' and 'Friday the 13th,' was completely destroyed. The Real Inn Malibu seafood restaurant, a favorite of Jerry Seinfeld and Cindy Crawford, also was destroyed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1qhi7gvye	2025-01-12T21:08:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/rJSQEZ11P1g/rJSQEZ11P1g_0_193_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Report from Hostage Square: Serious developments in ceasefire neg...	Dr. Mazen Abu Siam mourns deaths of Youssef and Hamza Ziyadne: 'The family waited for 15 months with great hope that their sons were alive' After the discovery of Youssef Ziyadne's death, forensic tests have now positively identified his son, Hamza Ziyadne, as deceased. The father and son were taken hostage by Hamas on October 7, 2023, during the attack on southern Israel. Their bodies were found in a tunnel near Rafah, Gaza, with Hamza's death confirmed on January 10. The Ziyadne family, who waited in hope for 15 months, were devastated by the news. They, along with many other families, have demanded the Israeli government take immediate action to secure the release of the remaining hostages. 'The family waited for 15 months with great hope that their sons were alive,' said a family friend, Dr. Mazen Abu Siam. 'On the day before yesterday, when the list of hostages to be released was published, Youssef's name was on it. So the hopes were high, but the disappointment was bigger. Currently, the family is very calm but is very angry with the government and decision-makers who have stalled in forging the deal, not only for their sons but for the sake of all the hostages.' Reports indicate serious developments in ceasefire negotiations. While progress has been slow, a Hamas spokesperson claims a deal is imminent. Israeli National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi and Mossad Chief David Barnea are directly involved, signaling the gravity of these talks. U.S., Qatari, and Egyptian mediators are facilitating efforts, raising hopes of securing a ceasefire and the release of hostages. With the clock ticking towards U.S. President-elect Trump’s inauguration, families, officials, and citizens continue to press for a resolution. The call for the return of hostages is louder than ever. For now, all eyes are on the negotiators and the government as the fate of these innocent lives hangs in the balance.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk8jbxfpkg	2025-01-12T20:52:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/11/Hyd1AHgwye/Hyd1AHgwye_0_59_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Believe it or not, not everything is related to Palestinians'	Comment on L.A. wildfires: 'It’s time for the world to wake up and stop tolerating the anti-Israel bullies' Los Angeles, California, continues to face tragic and deadly fires that have claimed the lives of at least 16 people, destroyed over 12,000 buildings, and displaced more than 150,000 Californians. Additionally, there is no power for over 90,000 residents in the area. As over 1,400 firefighters battle the ongoing blaze caused by the strong, dry Santa Ana winds, there have also been reports of arson and mass looting of evacuated homes. One of the worst fires, the Palisades Fire, has ravaged over 5,000 buildings and homes in the area. Yet, miraculously, Kehillat Israel, a local synagogue, managed to survive the fire. Now, the synagogue is not only serving as a symbol of hope in the neighborhood but also as a refuge for evacuees. In fact, the Los Angeles Jewish community is stepping up across the city, hosting meals and welcoming evacuees from all over. Unfortunately, not everyone is responding to the fires with the same generosity and support. Almost immediately following the outbreak of fires in California, anti-Israel activists, organizations, and even states began comparing the LA fires to the situation in Gaza, with some even celebrating the fires. Social media posts expressing sympathy for the people in LA who have lost their homes were riddled with comments not only attempting to make the story about Gaza but, in many cases, celebrating the devastation in LA. HTS, the Islamist group that overthrew Assad in Syria, made a post claiming the fires were 'justice,' while social media influencers like Khaled Safi implied the fires were payback for Gaza. Official regime media from the Islamic Republic of Iran also praised the fires, calling them God’s revenge for Gaza and Lebanon. Meanwhile, celebrities like Jamie Lee Curtis also made crude comparisons. Shortly after the fires broke out, notorious anti-Israel group Code Pink posted a video lobbying in the U.S. Congress about alleged connections between the wildfires and what they called the 'Gaza genocide.' Because apparently, nothing in the world can happen without it being about Palestinians. Climate change, Black Lives Matter, women’s rights, the Olympics, COVID-19, LGBTQ+ rights, even Christmas—Palestinian activists have attempted to hijack every single one of these issues to make themselves the focus, with no regard for the suffering or needs of others. Believe it or not, not everything is related to Palestinians. Not everything that takes place needs to be hijacked to make Palestinians the center of the world. This is not solidarity; it’s disrespect. Showing support for tragedies around the world means nothing when it’s only used to advance an agenda. It’s time for the world to wake up and stop tolerating the anti-Israel bullies who are harassing not only Jewish communities but virtually all of society in the West today.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjpimmgpjx	2025-01-12T20:24:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/09/BJfypSQ6Ukl/BJfypSQ6Ukl_0_303_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Glued to fire-tracking apps, watching red skies from bed and hearing firefighting helicopters overhead—the city braces for another wave of fires fueled by strong winds On Thursday afternoon, massive plumes of smoke rose over the hills opposite my home, growing into monstrous clouds by evening. The Watch Duty app buzzed incessantly, warning about the fire’s relentless march toward us, crossing the hills and threatening the residential neighborhoods of Encino, Tarzana and Sherman Oaks. I try to avoid the nerve-wracking news, yet it’s impossible to resist checking the app, which provides a real-time glimpse of the fire’s terrifying advance. As of now, only 11% of the Pacific Palisades fire has been contained. The winds, expected to intensify, loom as a dangerous force, threatening to spread the blaze even further. On Friday night, I lay in bed, staring at the fiery red skies and the eerie yellow glow of the flames in the distance. A helicopter circled overhead, valiantly dropping water to combat the inferno. I fell asleep, clinging to the hope that by morning, firefighters would gain some control over the advancing blaze. The mood in Los Angeles is one of mounting frustration. Everyone points fingers at the same culprits: Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom. Since taking office two years ago, Bass slashed $118 million from the firefighting budget. Newsom, for his part, reduced funding for wildfire response and forest resilience by over $100 million. In a state infamous for its annual wildfire disasters, such cuts feel utterly reckless. My cousin, who spent nearly 40 years living in Pacific Palisades, lost her home. Another cousin lost hers in Malibu. Not everyone in these neighborhoods is a millionaire. Many lived there long before the areas became havens for the wealthy. John Carr, 65, stayed behind to save his house in Pacific Palisades, built by his parents in 1960. 'Some things in life are worth fighting for,' he said. 'If I lose this house, I won’t be able to afford to build another.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Thanks to Carr’s bravery, his house and the two homes next door were spared. As I try to imagine whether I would have the courage to stay and fight for my own home if the fires came closer, I can only hope I never have to make that choice. On Saturday morning, I woke up to a massive gray cloud overhead—but thankfully, the flames had not yet reached us. Six months ago, many insurance companies in Los Angeles canceled wildfire coverage, deeming it too risky. This left numerous homeowners without insurance, while others are uncertain how much their policies will actually cover. Either way, it won’t be 100%. This uncertainty is fueling widespread anxiety, and some residents have chosen to stay behind to defend their homes. The most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles history has already destroyed over 12,000 buildings and claimed at least 16 lives. Winds, which briefly weakened, threaten to pick up again. Meanwhile, critical failures in emergency infrastructure have been exposed, prompting the governor to order an independent investigation: 'The fire hydrants didn’t work.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hykxgqbpkx	2025-01-12T11:26:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/HkNNSW11Dkx/HkNNSW11Dkx_0_218_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Zelensky says ready to exchange N. Korean soldiers for Ukrainians...	Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday Kyiv is ready to hand over North Korean soldiers to their leader Kim Jong Un if he can organize their exchange for Ukrainians held captive in Russia. 'In addition to the first captured soldiers from North Korea, there will undoubtedly be more. It's only a matter of time before our troops manage to capture others,' Zelensky said on the social media platform X. Zelensky said on Saturday that Ukraine had captured two North Korean soldiers in Russia's Kursk region, the first time Ukraine has announced the capture of North Korean soldiers alive since their entry into the nearly three-year-old war last autumn. Ukrainian and Western assessments say that some 11,000 troops from Russia's ally North Korea have been deployed in the Kursk region to support Moscow's forces. Russia has neither confirmed nor denied their presence. Zelensky has said Russian and North Korean forces had suffered heavy losses.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skaooc11wkl	2025-01-12T10:45:12-08:00	
Israeli Druze leader travels to US to rally support for Syrian Dr...	Amid fears of civil war in Syria and the rise of HTS chief Ahmad al-Sharaa, the Druze community resists disarmament and demands international intervention to address rights violations and ensure stability in southern Syria amid growing tensions Amid fears of a civil war in Syria following the fall of Assad’s regime and the rise of jihadist rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, minority communities, particularly the Druze, are increasingly concerned about their safety and future in the country. The Druze fear persecution if they do not comply with al-Sharaa’s new mandates, which include revising Syria’s school curriculum to emphasize Islamic teachings and Quranic studies, even for non-Muslims. Furthermore, the new leadership in Syria has refused to appoint a Druze governor in Sweida, the largest Druze-majority region in the Middle East, located in southwestern Syria. Instead, Ahmad Ouda, who is held responsible for the deaths of over 200 Druze during 2017 clashes—primarily in the village of Hader—has been appointed to oversee Druze areas. In light of these developments, Druze residents in Sweida have refused to disarm and surrender their weapons to al-Sharaa’s forces, which are essentially a rebranded version of the Jabhat al-Nusra terrorist organization, which has a history of carrying out attacks in Druze areas. The Druze have also blocked the entry of new regime police forces into their regions until their rights and status are secured. Before ascending to power, al-Sharaa made public statements against the Druze, declaring, 'They are Muslims who have lost their way and must be brought back to the right path.' Such remarks have alarmed the Druze minority, who remain deeply skeptical of the new Syrian leader’s assurances. Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, the spiritual leader of the Druze community in Israel, is actively working to protect the Druze in Syria and ensure their safety amid growing instability. Sheikh Tarif has traveled to the United States, where he has met with senior international leaders, including UN Secretary-General António Guterres, to discuss the plight of the Druze in Syria and Lebanon due to the current volatile situation. During his visit to Washington and New York, Sheikh Tarif held meetings with U.S. senators, congress members, senior officials from both the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations, Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Mike Herzog and Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon. He also addressed a prominent think tank focused on Middle Eastern issues. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Following their meeting, Ambassador Danon said: 'I thank Sheikh Tarif for his significant visit to the U.S. The Druze community is an inseparable part of Israeli society. We are doing everything in our power to assist them and ensure their safety both in Israel and abroad. We will continue to work on the international stage to guarantee their well-being.' Sheikh Tarif emphasized the need for international awareness and intervention, saying, 'The uncertainty in southern Syria necessitates international involvement and monitoring. Stability in Syria cannot be achieved without ensuring the stability and historical rights of Druze communities.' During the meetings, Sheikh Tarif also raised the issue of Israeli captives held in Gaza, urging greater involvement from the UN. Secretary-General Guterres reaffirmed his commitment, emphasizing that the hostages should be released unconditionally as a top humanitarian priority. He noted that he carries a token from the captives’ families as a constant reminder of the issue. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjc3kwzw1x	2025-01-12T10:15:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/17/BkW3ELrJHyg/BkW3ELrJHyg_198_45_1061_597_0_small.jpg
Biden calls for immediate cease-fire in call with Netanyahu, Whit...	Eight days before leaving office, US president urges PM to secure hostage deal before Trump’s inauguration; Netanyahu updates Biden on Israel’s Doha delegation, as VP-elect JD Vance projects progress soon U.S. President Joe Biden spoke on Sunday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the White House said, as U.S. officials race to reach a Gaza hostage and cease-fire deal before Biden leaves office on Jan. 20. Biden and Netanyahu discussed efforts underway to reach a deal to halt the fighting in the Palestinian enclave and free the remaining hostages there, the White House said in a statement after the two leaders spoke by telephone. Biden 'stressed the immediate need for a cease-fire in Gaza and return of the hostages with a surge in humanitarian aid enabled by a stoppage in the fighting under the deal,' it said. Netanyahu updated Biden on progress in the talks and on the mandate he has given his top-level security delegation now in Doha in order to advance a hostage deal, Netanyahu said in a statement. The two leaders also discussed 'the fundamentally changed regional circumstances following the cease-fire deal in Lebanon, the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, and the weakening of Iran's power in the region,' the White House said. Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN's State of the Union earlier on Sunday that the parties were 'very, very close' to reaching a deal, but still had to get it across the finish line. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He said Biden was getting daily updates on the talks in Doha, where Israeli and Palestinian officials have said since Thursday that some progress has been made in the indirect talks between Israel and Hamas. 'We are still determined to use every day we have in office to get this done,' Sullivan said, 'and we are not, by any stretch of imagination, setting this aside.' He said there was still a chance to reach an agreement before Biden leaves office, but that it was also possible 'Hamas, in particular, remains intransigent.' During their call, Netanyahu also thanked Biden for his lifelong support of Israel and 'the extraordinary support from the United States for Israel's security and national defense,' the White House said. Israel launched its assault in Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed across its borders in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. U.S. Vice President-elect JD Vance told Fox News Sunday in an interview taped on Saturday that he expects a deal for the release of U.S. hostages in the Middle East to be announced in the final days of the Biden administration, maybe in the last day or two. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, a staunch supporter of Israel, has strongly backed Netanyahu's goal of destroying Hamas. He has promised to bring peace to the Middle East, but has not said how he would accomplish that. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkqxg9zvkg	2025-01-12T10:02:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/04/14/B1ebI4BtxR/B1ebI4BtxR_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Decorated IDF soldier dies in motorcycle crash during Thailand va...	Rotem Yaish, a Givati Brigade soldier who served for a year in Gaza and previously awarded a presidential citation for excellence, killed in motorcycle accident while vacationing with his family in Koh Samui Rotem Yaish, an IDF soldier who received a presidential citation for his distinguished military service, was killed in a motorcycle accident in Koh Samui, Thailand, on Friday during a family vacation. Yaish, who enlisted in the Givati Brigade in December 2021, had recently completed his compulsory military service and served in the reserves during the war in Gaza. The eldest of three siblings, Yaish was remembered as a dedicated and accomplished soldier. His mother, Tahel, shared in 2022 her pride on the day he joined the army: 'We hugged him, encouraged him and spoke about this new chapter in his life with great excitement.' A year later, the family’s pride grew as Rotem was honored by President Isaac Herzog at Israel’s Independence Day state ceremony. At the time, Yaish expressed his joy about his role as a commander in the military: 'I’m heading to the front lines now with my soldiers, and I’m proud to serve.' When asked whom he told first about his award, he replied, 'My mom.' To him, being Israeli meant 'coming home in uniform and mutual responsibility.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: During the war in Gaza, Yaish served for over a year, enduring grueling combat operations and losing comrades. He completed his service and continued to serve in the reserves. Rotem’s uncle, Dror, eulogized him on Facebook: 'For the past year and a half, you fought in Gaza. We prayed, worried, and feared the words ‘cleared for publication.’ Every incident made us hold our breath, hoping it wasn’t you. You lost friends, soldiers under your command, and commanders. But you came out of Gaza like a lion, leaving behind a generation of soldiers you led.' Dror recounted the family’s joy just a week prior when Rotem and his loved ones embarked on a dream vacation to Thailand. 'The pictures you sent showed how much you were enjoying yourselves. But on Friday, just an hour before Shabbat, the phone didn’t stop ringing. Then the news came—Rotem was gone. We’re heartbroken and in shock.' Yaish’s body will be brought back to Israel later this week for burial. He leaves behind his parents and two younger siblings. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rktxvuzvkl	2025-01-12T08:39:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/HJV5UEbw1x/HJV5UEbw1x_0_63_449_253_0_small.jpg

Riots erupt in Italy after police kill Egyptian teen; synagogue a...	Protests erupted in Rome and Bologna after police footage shows scooter chase ending in death of Rami El-Gamal, who fled routine stop; in Bologna, activists target synagogue with Molotov cocktails and fireworks while scrawling 'Justice for Gaza' on nearby wall The death of Rami El-Gamal, a 19-year-old of Egyptian origin, in late November has ignited violent protests across Italian cities, with outrage mounting against police. The unrest has also spilled over into antisemitic violence, with the Jewish community in Bologna falling victim to targeted attacks. The incident that sparked the turmoil began on Nov. 24 in Milan's Crosto neighborhood. El-Gamal and his friend, 22-year-old Tunisian-born Fares Bouzidi, were riding a scooter late at night when police attempted a routine stop. The pair fled, reportedly because Bouzidi lacked a valid driver’s license, and El-Gamal may not have had proper identification. A high-speed chase ensued, spanning eight kilometers (five miles) until the scooter crashed, killing El-Gamal. Initial reports framed the incident as an accident, but newly released surveillance footage depicted police repeatedly ramming the scooter before it toppled. Recordings from the police patrol car captured officers hurling insults at the pair and one officer urging another to 'hit them.' After the crash, officers allegedly threatened a bystander, Omar, who had filmed the chase, demanding he delete the footage. The footage, which surfaced last week, reignited public anger, leading to violent demonstrations over the weekend. Protests escalated in Rome and Bologna, where masked demonstrators clashed with police, damaged property and injured several officers. In Bologna, rioters also targeted the city’s synagogue. Bologna Mayor Matteo Lepore expressed solidarity with the Jewish community, calling the attack 'shocking and unacceptable.' The president of Bologna’s Jewish community, Daniele De Paz, described the attack as deliberate, with rioters hurling Molotov cocktails and homemade explosives while shouting threats. Graffiti reading 'Justice for Gaza' was scrawled near the synagogue, and pro-Palestinian groups were reportedly among the rioters. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The synagogue attack drew sharp criticism of local authorities, with Jewish leaders accusing the city of leniency toward escalating pro-Palestinian violence. Bologna’s recent decision to display a Palestinian flag at city hall has also been met with backlash. Politicians weighed in, with right-wing leaders defending the police and condemning the protests while left-leaning figures criticized alleged police misconduct. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni denounced the violence, expressing 'deep concern' over the riots and attacks on institutions. The unrest has left Bologna’s historic center resembling a war zone, with widespread damage and heightened tensions gripping the country. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skczllwpkx	2025-01-12T07:11:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/BkAvxQWP1l/BkAvxQWP1l_0_134_1280_720_0_small.jpg

German far-right AfD heads for elections with support from Musk	Tech billionaire says AfD is Germany's only chance for survival; Alice Weidel elected party candidate for chancellor calls for deportation of immigrants Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party kicked off its election campaign after a two-hour delay caused by left-wing protesters who demonstrated outside, clashing with police. The two-day event that started on Saturday is being held in the town of Riesa in the eastern state of Saxony, a stronghold of AfD, now the second largest political party, according to polling. Alice Weidel was chosen as the party's candidate for chancellor in the elections scheduled for February 23. The Afd platform is to be revealed in the conference. It will call for diminished support for Ukraine in its war against the Russian invasion, a demand that Germany leave the EU, and the resumption of nuclear energy production along with harsher laws restricting immigration. Weidel had called for a mass deportation of immigrants from Germany, even those who were already German citizens. Weidel is considered an outsider in the male dominated party. She is a lesbian who is raising two children in Switzerland with her partner, an immigrant from Sri Lanka. She received huge support recently from American tech billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk in posts on his platform X. He said only the Afd would be able to save Germany. In an online chat with Musk, Weidel said Hitler had come from the left-wing and that the AfD was in no way connected to him. When pushed into a corner by Musk, she expressed support for Israel's right to exist and defend itself. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Afd has been encouraged by political events in neighboring Austria where the ruling coalition, formed to block the participation of the far-right Freedom Party, fell and the president tasked the former Nazi party with forming a new government. Weidel is unlikely to become chancellor in the next elections although events in Austria could signal that all options are open. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rji3igbdkx	2025-01-12T03:29:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/BJXdk11Wvkl/BJXdk11Wvkl_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Palestinian senior official claims more than 3,000 terrorists to ...	The man responsible for the Palestinian prisoners issue makes a rare statement: All children and women in Israeli prisons will be released, along with dozens of terrorists from the Shalit deal Qadura Fares, head of the Palestinian Prisoners Affairs Committee who is responsible for the terrorists held in Israeli prisons, made a rare statement on Sunday amid reported progress in the hostage negotiations. According to him, in the first phase of the deal, 25 hostages will be released in exchange for the release of 48 terrorists who were released in the Shalit deal and have since been re-imprisoned; about 200 terrorists who were sentenced to life imprisonment; as well as about 1,000 other prisoners - including all the children, women and sick people held in Israeli prisons. In an interview with the Palestinian news agency Ma'an, Fares claimed that estimates indicate that the actual number of Palestinian prisoners to be released will be much higher, more than 3,000. Israel insisted on including additional Israeli hostages on the list, including wounded soldiers. However, Israel would have to release more terrorists serving life sentences for hostages who do not meet the 'humanitarian' category. On Saturday, a senior political source told Ynet ahead of the senior delegation's departure for Qatar that the discussions are about the release of 33 hostages, according to the list of 34 that was revealed last week - which no longer includes Youssef Ziyadne, whose body and the body of his son were recovered from a tunnel in Gaza. 'We are discussing a list of 33 hostages, all of whom need to return both alive and dead. This is the first stage of the deal,' he said. According to him, 'The negotiations are about everyone, the living and the dead, and deal with the transition from one stage to the next and how we discuss the second stage, with the understanding that 98 hostages need to be brought home. Today, too, there was a discussion on the key points because this is one of the components of the deal.' While Israel claims that discussions are ongoing on the issue of prisoners to be released, Fares noted that all terrorists who are to be released, except for those sentenced to life, are supposed to return to their homes, whether in Israeli territory, Gaza or the West Bank. The terrorists serving life sentences will probably be deported to Qatar, Egypt or Turkey. On Saturday, in a conference call with the envoys of outgoing President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to send a senior delegation to Qatar. The delegation will include Mossad chief David Barnea, Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, Maj. Gen. (res.) Nitzan Alon and the prime minister's political advisor Ofir Falk. In the meantime, cabinet members are almost completely excluded from the talks on the deal. On Sunday, after U.S. President-elect Trump conveyed a message through his envoy to the Middle East that he wants to see a deal formed by January 20, the date of his inauguration, Minister of National Missions Orit Strook said in an interview: 'Trump does not want a terrible deal like the one that is on the table to be under his name. Many soldiers will pay with their lives and what we see now is nothing, all the effort to clean up the Gaza Strip will go to waste. Such a deal is a clear victory and a reward for terrorism.' Yehuda Cohen, the father of kidnapped soldier Nimrod Cohen, said that 'Strook's words are shameful, atrocious words. Instead of speaking on behalf of Trump as if he were your friend in the Religious Zionist Party, and instead of continuing to rant about continuing a futile fight at the expense of the lives of IDF soldiers and the suffering of the hostages, including my son, let the minister with the unnecessary office take stock of all the horrific events that have occurred since October 7, 2023 and resign and stand trial'. Sharon Sharabi, brother of hostages Eli Sharabi and the late Yossi Sharabi, told Ynet on Sunday that 'these upheavals that we have been experiencing for 15 months cannot be explained in words. What is happening in Doha right now is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to return the hostages, both alive and dead. It is time to make courageous decisions to return as many of our people as possible from there. If we wait a little longer, we will have no one to bring back.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to him, the families of the hostages are meeting with parties involved in the negotiations. 'Everything that is happening right now, and this uncertainty, does not foreshadow the return of the hostages home. Both Israel and Hamas have learned from each other.' 'Both sides understood that a prolonged cease-fire is crucial, but this deal will also return the values of the State of Israel and the hostages home. I have had enough disappointments. Ultimately, after 15 months, this is a colossal failure. We should have paid the price long ago. Perhaps the geopolitical changes are affecting Hamas,' he added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjl11pmwpyg	2025-01-12T03:18:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/rkNTNl11DJg/rkNTNl11DJg_0_0_660_372_0_small.jpg

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky called on allies on Sunday to honor all promises to supply Ukraine with weapons, including those to counter Russian air attacks. Zelensky said that over the past week Russian forces had launched hundreds of strikes on Ukraine and nearly 700 aerial bombs and over 600 attack drones were used. Ukrainian air defenses downed 60 out of 94 drones launched by Russia overnight, the air force said on Sunday. It said that 34 drones were 'lost,' in reference to Ukraine's use of electronic warfare to redirect Russian drones. 'Every week, the Russian war continues only because the Russian army retains its ability to terrorize Ukraine and exploit its superiority in the sky,' Zelenskiy said on the Telegram messaging app. He called on Ukraine's allies to fulfil agreements already made.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy6ha7zpjg	2025-01-12T02:58:15-08:00	
This young visionary is educating woman and children in tribal Pa...	Educator Najeeb Ullah provides access to knowledge and skills in Pakistan’s tribal areas along the Afghanistan border devastated by conflict and terrorism after being inspired by his own struggle Over the past decade, Pakistan’s tribal areas along the Afghanistan border have endured the scars of conflict and terrorism. These regions, once besieged by relentless violence, became a focal point of Pakistan’s military campaign against armed groups, including the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The crackdown on militant strongholds escalated hostilities, forcing millions to flee their homes in one of Asia’s largest internal displacements. Entire communities were uprooted, and educational institutions were reduced to rubble, leaving a generation grappling with despair and lost opportunities. Amid this backdrop of destruction and fear, a young visionary from Mohmand District, Najeeb Ullah, chose a different path – one of hope and resilience. In 2014, at just 17 years old, he launched the region’s first-ever Mashaal library to restore access to education in his conflict-ridden homeland. The word 'mashaal,' meaning 'torch' in Pashto, symbolizes illumination in the darkest times – a fitting metaphor for Najeeb’s mission. A bold beginning Najeeb, who pursued a master’s degree in conflict and peace studies from the National Defense University in Islamabad, was inspired by his own struggles. 'In 2014, while traveling to Peshawar to purchase books for my grade 12 exams, I realized how inaccessible education had become for students in war-torn areas,' he recalled. That moment of clarity drove him to collect books and establish a library, enabling economically disadvantaged students to continue their studies. Despite limited resources, Najeeb’s determination prevailed. What began as a small library has since evolved into a community cornerstone. By 2021, he expanded his efforts to establish the region’s first children’s library. In January 2024, he launched the Mashaal Skills Center for Women, a modest operation housed in the veranda of his mud home, around 14 miles northwest of Peshawar. This center equips women with skills like sewing and crafts, empowering them to overcome cultural and economic barriers. Libraries that inspire Today, Najeeb’s two libraries serve as vital hubs of learning. Thousands of books now line their walls, offering students the chance to pursue education despite the absence of functioning schools. In 2015, he introduced an innovative mobile book delivery service using two motorcycles, ensuring that even students in remote areas could access reading materials. 'Countless women benefit from this service,' Najeeb shared, emphasizing the importance of reaching those most affected by conflict. Najeeb’s long-term vision is ambitious: to create what he hopes will be 'the world’s largest library of its kind' and establish a university for women that offers free education. Reflecting on his journey, he said, 'The library is a beacon of hope and knowledge for the youth in my area, guiding them away from fear and toward mental development.' Empowering women through teaching skills The Mashaal Skills Center has already transformed the lives of over 100 women and girls, including widows and orphans, in just one year. 'The trainees are now sewing clothes, designing unique garments, and even crafting purses from woolen threads. This has unlocked new opportunities for economic independence,' Najeeb explained. He envisions the center as a catalyst for change, providing women with tools to break cycles of poverty and ignorance. 'By equipping women with essential skills, we are creating a ripple effect of progress and dignity,' he said. Voices of change The impact of Najeeb’s initiatives resonates deeply within the community. Shafi Ullah, a postgraduate scholar from Mohmand, credited the Mashaal Library with enabling him to complete his education after years of disruption. 'Hundreds of young people, including myself, have relied on this library to continue learning in the absence of schools,' he said. Arshad Khan, a tribal leader from Mohmand, highlighted the broader need for such centers across Pakistan’s tribal belt. 'Libraries and study centers are essential for rebuilding the social and educational fabric destroyed by years of conflict. They provide children with constructive activities, steering them away from terrorism,' he said. The skills center has similarly empowered women. Sana Gul, a schoolteacher from Mohmand, shared how the Mashaal Mobile Library helped her complete her education without defying tribal customs. 'I went on to secure a government job and now dedicate myself to teaching girls with the same passion that once paved the way for my own education,' she said. A call for support Experts agree that grassroots efforts like Najeeb’s are vital for the region’s recovery.

This young visionary is educating woman and children in tribal Pa...	Educator Najeeb Ullah provides access to knowledge and skills in Pakistan’s tribal areas along the Afghanistan border devastated by conflict and terrorism after being inspired by his own struggle Over the past decade, Pakistan’s tribal areas along the Afghanistan border have endured the scars of conflict and terrorism. These regions, once besieged by relentless violence, became a focal point of Pakistan’s military campaign against armed groups, including the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The crackdown on militant strongholds escalated hostilities, forcing millions to flee their homes in one of Asia’s largest internal displacements. Entire communities were uprooted, and educational institutions were reduced to rubble, leaving a generation grappling with despair and lost opportunities. Amid this backdrop of destruction and fear, a young visionary from Mohmand District, Najeeb Ullah, chose a different path – one of hope and resilience. In 2014, at just 17 years old, he launched the region’s first-ever Mashaal library to restore access to education in his conflict-ridden homeland. The word 'mashaal,' meaning 'torch' in Pashto, symbolizes illumination in the darkest times – a fitting metaphor for Najeeb’s mission. A bold beginning Najeeb, who pursued a master’s degree in conflict and peace studies from the National Defense University in Islamabad, was inspired by his own struggles. 'In 2014, while traveling to Peshawar to purchase books for my grade 12 exams, I realized how inaccessible education had become for students in war-torn areas,' he recalled. That moment of clarity drove him to collect books and establish a library, enabling economically disadvantaged students to continue their studies. Despite limited resources, Najeeb’s determination prevailed. What began as a small library has since evolved into a community cornerstone. By 2021, he expanded his efforts to establish the region’s first children’s library. In January 2024, he launched the Mashaal Skills Center for Women, a modest operation housed in the veranda of his mud home, around 14 miles northwest of Peshawar. This center equips women with skills like sewing and crafts, empowering them to overcome cultural and economic barriers. Libraries that inspire Today, Najeeb’s two libraries serve as vital hubs of learning. Thousands of books now line their walls, offering students the chance to pursue education despite the absence of functioning schools.

The rate of HMPV infections in northern China is declining, Chine...	The rate of infections with the flu-like human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in northern China is declining, a health official said Sunday, amid some international concern over a potential pandemic. HMPV, which belongs to the same family as the respiratory syncytial virus, causes flu or cold-like symptoms including fever, cough and nasal congestion. 'The human metapneumovirus is not a new virus, and has been with humans for at least several decades,' said Wang Liping, a researcher at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, during a press briefing by China's National Health Commission. 'At present, the rate of positive cases in human metapneumovirus detection is fluctuating, and the rate of positive cases in northern provinces is declining, and the rate of positive cases among patients aged 14 and below has started to decline,' she said. Concerns surfaced in recent days over a surge in HMPV infections in northern China after images circulated online of hospitals overrun with masked patients. The World Health Organization said it has not received reports of unusual outbreaks in China or elsewhere.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjrujmzvkx	2025-01-12T01:57:46-08:00

Pro-Palestinian online campaign claims Hamas rapes did not happen	Prosecutor purposely misquoted in propaganda effort says Hamas terrorists and Gazans who invaded Israel on Oct. 7 raped young women and murdered them, sometimes the during the act; says any distortion of this fact is a lie Palestinian propagandists distorted the words of an Israeli prosecutor, who was until recently a member of the team prosecuting Hamas sexual crimes on October 7, to claim there had been no rapes during the massacre. Moran Gez said in an interview with Ynet's sister publication Yedioth Ahronoth that it was hard to prosecute the rapes and sexual assault committed by the terrorists because many of the victims of the atrocities did not survive and therefore could not come forward. 'Unfortunately, we have no victims. They were either murdered or some of those who were raped chose not to come forward to share what had happened,' she said. She said women's groups also had few recorded testimonies although they were approached by parents asking what they can do when their daughter was a victim of those crimes. Although there is evidence of rapes and sexual assaults, the difficulty in trial is attributing the atrocity to a particular perpetrator. 'I would lower expectations,' Gez said. 'I know there is a desire in the public and I understand the need when dealing with such heinous crimes, but most of the cases may not meet the standards of the courts for convictions. Soon after the interview was published, posts appeared on social media claiming the accusations of rape were a 'mistake,' or a 'joke.' A journalist who has hundreds of thousands of followers led a campaign of denial of the rape accusations, using the interview and the fact that no charges were filed, as 'evidence' that no such crimes were committed. Gez said she was astounded at the post. 'Hamas terrorists raped young Israelis and murdered them, even while the rape was still going on,' she said. 'Amid such trauma, women who were raped by the terrorists and residents of Gaza who followed them across the border, could not muster the courage to report the ordeal. Any other interpretation of my words is nothing more that cheap propaganda that ignores the fact that Hamas terrorists committed war crimes. The only appropriate punishment for them, in my view, is death.'

IDF intensifies West Bank operations despite decreasing number of...	The hunt for the terrorists from the attack in the village of Al-Funduq continues throughout the weekend; Despite decrease in number of attacks, the IDF intends to increase its activity its intensity After the deadly attack last week, in which three people were murdered, the situation assessment in the West Bank has not changed but is definitely at an important milestone. The IDF Central Command is continuing the hunt for the terrorists who carried out the attack, with the understanding being that they came from the northern West Bank. On Friday, the IDF operated with special units in the heart of the Kabatiya camp. Eight wanted individuals were arrested, and the homes of the three terrorists who carried out the attack in the Al-Funduq were mapped. The terrorists' time is limited, and the circle around them is tightening. At the same time, and despite the decrease in the number of attacks, the Central Command agrees that the scope of operations must be increased even further, with an emphasis on the northern area of the West Bank. The Head of Central Command, Major General Avi Bluth, is allowing brigades to operate relatively freely in the West Bank with offensive operations. Security sources explained that a certain change had occurred following the IDF attacks in the Jordan Valley area. The IDF has attacked the area with special forces and the Air Force in operations that lasted for days. The security establishment notes the change that has occurred in the region, similar to the Nablus area, which also underwent a change after the counter-terrorism operation. However, at the same time, the same sources explain that the work is far from over and there are still terrorist infrastructures that are being attempted to be established in those areas. In the days following the terror attack, questions were raised about the security coordination that the IDF maintains with the Palestinian Authority's security mechanisms. Although the PA security personnel operate in the West Bank, some voices in the government call for the dissolution of the PA. Despite the 'lone wolf' terrorism Israel experiences by Palestinian civilians who occasionally take a knife or an axe and set out to carry out a terror attack, the security establishment notes that the Palestinian people have not joined the war through an intifada similar to previous operations. The Palestinian restraint must be taken into account despite calls to wipe out Jenin as was heard by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. Despite the general decrease in numbers of cases, daily terrorism actions such as throwing Molotov cocktails still takes place in the West Bank. And yet, the West Bank is a deceptive region. Bluth, who also visited the families of Master Sgt. Elad Yaakov Winkelstein, Rachel Cohen and Aliza Reiss over the weekend, who were murdered in the horrific attack, agrees that offensive activity should be increased in the coming weeks. Security sources explain that the IDF should not act based on intelligence and in a targeted manner, but rather seize an area like the Nur a-Shams refugee camp or the Jenin camp, surround it, conduct house-to-house searches and confiscate weapons. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Several months ago, the Central Command carried out such activities, which began with a massive counter-terrorism operation in Jenin. Although the forces relied on intelligence, the IDF raided locations without indications and found weapon caches in civilian areas. In the coming months, the Central Command must increase its activity in the heart of the refugee camps, make use of diverse attack patterns, and increase the pressure on the terrorist battalions in the northern West Bank. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry6nhgzpke	2025-01-12T01:28:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/11/yk14219449/yk14219449_1_33_965_544_0_small.jpg

A truck driver reported that his vehicle was stolen in Tiberias and, after a manhunt, the 23-year old suspect was located in a cave on the side of a mountain and completely naked, after hiding his clothes under leaves A 23-year-old man from Lod was arrested last week on suspicion of stealing a truck in Tiberias. During his escape attempt, he hit other vehicles and injured other passengers. After searches, which began following a report by a truck driver who claimed that his vehicle was stolen while he was unloading goods, the Northern District police were shocked to find the suspect inside a cave, on a mountainside, completely naked. His detention has been extended until Monday. Watch the footage of his arrest: The incident occurred on January 8, when the police received a report from a truck driver who had come to unload goods claiming that his vehicle had been stolen after he had left it parked outside. Shortly after, civilians reported traffic accidents involving a truck that had driven onto a sidewalk, hit vehicles and caused minor injuries to several people. The truck was found abandoned in an open area and the suspect disappeared from the scene. Police began searching the mountainside near where the truck was found. About an hour after the searches began, while the police were searching inside a cave, they identified a suspicious man, completely naked, who refused to identify himself, pretending to be an Arab and claiming that he did not speak Hebrew.

ISIS plot to bomb Shiite shrine in Damascus thwarted	Operation led to four arrests and the seizure of weapons, ammunition, grenades, communication devices and cash [Idlib] - Syria’s Ministry of Interior confirmed on Saturday that it had thwarted an Islamic State (ISIS) bombing plot targeting the Sayyida Zainab shrine on the outskirts of Damascus, a revered site for Shi’ite Muslims. A security official from the Ministry of Interior told The Media Line that the operation led to four arrests and the seizure of weapons, ammunition, grenades, communication devices, and cash. According to the intelligence source, who requested anonymity, the General Intelligence Directorate’s specialized counter-ISIS division, working alongside the Public Security Directorate in rural Damascus, arrested four individuals implicated in the plot before they could detonate the explosives. He added that 'security forces are conducting regular sweep operations across several Syrian provinces to track remnants of the ousted regime, fugitives involved in various crimes, and ISIS militants.' The Ministry of Interior reiterated its stance against terrorism, affirming that it will not tolerate any terrorist activities within Syria. It vowed to act decisively against any group attempting to exploit instability in certain areas of the country to carry out attacks, with particular focus on combating ISIS.

Guerilla warfare and IEDs exact a price in Gaza's Beit Hanoun	Latest fallen soldiers killed in a powerful explosion on a logistical road cleared and secured by IDF forces; Terrorists likely used an undiscovered tunnel nearby; Beit Hanoun offensive aims to allow safe train travel to Sderot As of Sunday morning, 11 IDF soldiers were killed in the Beit Hanoun area of central Gaza in the past two weeks. The Hamas battalion there, considered the weakest in the terrorist army, has, since the military began its latest offensive there, reverted to guerilla warfare. On Saturday, Sergeant Major (res.) Alexander Fedorenko, Staff Sergeant Danila Diakov, Sergeant Yahav Maayan and Sergeant Eliav Astuker were killed when a remote explosive device was detonated. Initial investigation revealed that the terrorists took advantage of the bad weather on Tuesday night to place the powerful device on the side of the road that has been used as a logistical route since the start of the operation, after it was cleared from enemies and while tight security measures were in place there. The road has been in use by the forces, but no one saw the terrorists approach it. There may be an underground tunnel that had not been discovered nearby, where explosives could be placed and remotely detonated. In the explosion, five other soldiers were hurt, two of them seriously. In a suspected friendly fire incident that ensued, a mass casualty event was announced. Unlike neighboring Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun does not have a significant city center to conquer. The local population was evacuated leaving only the remaining terrorists, so the IDF's mission is mostly to destroy structures, and not only those that are near the border with Israel. The mission is to allow the resumption of train travel to Sderot safe from anti-tank missile fire, and to protect Kibbutz Erez from attack. The troops found more than 30 explosive devices in Beit Hanoun in the past two weeks, but those who have not been identified, have caused heavy casualties. In another explosion last week, three IDF soldiers were killed and the military was investigating whether the Hamas terrorists used explosives from IDF bombs, to make their device. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The terrorists in Beit Hanoun use destroyed buildings in the city to their advantage, as the troops consider them cleared from enemy forces.

Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office confirms wildfire de...	Teams conducting systematic grid searches with cadaver dogs looking for bodies of victims; tens of thousands of people remained under evacuation orders, more than 12,000 homes, apartment buildings, businesses, outbuildings and vehicles burned The Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office confirmed the death toll from the wildfires ravaging the area has risen to 16 and the cases remain under investigation. Five of the deaths were attributed to the Palisades Fire, and 11 resulted from the Eaton Fire, the coroner’s office said in a statement Saturday evening. The previous number of confirmed fatalities was 11, but officials said they expected that figure to rise as cadaver dogs search leveled neighborhoods and crews assess the devastation. Authorities have established a center where people can report the missing. Firefighters raced to cut off spreading wildfires before potentially strong winds return that could push the flames toward the world famous J. Paul Getty Museum and the University of California, Los Angeles, while new evacuation warnings left more homeowners on edge. A fierce battle against the flames was underway in Mandeville Canyon, home to Arnold Schwarzenegger and other celebrities not far from the Pacific coast, where swooping helicopters dumped water as the blaze charged downhill. Firefighters on the ground used hoses in an attempt to beat back leaping flames as thick smoke blanketed the chaparral-covered hillside. At a briefing, CalFire Operations Chief Christian Litz said a main focus Saturday would be the Palisades Fire burning in the canyon area, not far from the UCLA campus. 'We need to be aggressive out there,' Litz said. County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath said the LA area 'had another night of unimaginable terror and heartbreak, and even more Angelenos evacuated due to the northeast expansion of the Palisades Fire.' Light breezes were fanning the flames, but the National Weather Service warned that strong Santa Ana winds — the nemesis of firefighters — could soon return. Those winds have been largely blamed for turning the wildfires into infernos that leveled entire neighborhoods around to city where there has been no significant rainfall in more than eight months. The fire also was threatening to jump over Interstate 405 and into densely populated areas in the Hollywood Hills and San Fernando Valley. The hunt for bodies continues The grim work of sifting through the devastation continued Saturday, with teams conducting systematic grid searches with cadaver dogs, said Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna. He said a family assistance center was being established in Pasadena, and he urged residents to abide by curfews. 'We have people driving up and around trying to get in just to look. Stay away,' he said. The fires have consumed about 56 square miles (145 square kilometers), an area larger than San Francisco. Tens of thousands of people remained under evacuation orders and new evacuations were ordered Friday evening after a flare up on the eastern side of the Palisades Fire. Since the fires first began Tuesday just north of downtown LA, they have burned more than 12,000 structures, a term that includes homes, apartment buildings, businesses, outbuildings and vehicles. No cause has been determined for the largest fires, and early estimates indicate the wildfires could be the nation’s costliest ever. A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. Rays of kindness amid the devastation So many volunteers showed up to help at donation centers Saturday that some were being turned away. That was the case at a YMCA in the Koreatown neighborhood. By late morning, cars with would-be helpers were also being turned back from the Santa Anita Park horse racing track, where donations of necessities were being accepted. At the race track Friday, people who lost their homes could be seen sifting through stacks of donated shirts, blankets and other household goods. Altadena resident Jose Luis Godinez said three homes occupied by more than a dozen of his family members were destroyed. 'Everything is gone,' he said, speaking in Spanish. 'All my family lived in those three houses and now we have nothing.' Officials warn against returning to burned homes Some residents have been venturing back to see what can be salvaged after wildfires destroyed their homes, sifting through rubble for keepsakes. But officials on Saturday urged them to stay away, warning that the ash can contain lead, arsenic, asbestos and other harmful materials. 'If you’re kicking that stuff up, you’re breathing it in,' said Chris Thomas, a spokesman for the unified incident command at the Palisades Fire. 'All of that stuff is toxic.' Residents will be allowed to return, with protective gear, after damage teams have evaluated their properties, Thomas said.

Meanwhile, Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said city leadership failed her department by not providing enough money for firefighting. She also criticized the lack of water. 'When a firefighter comes up to a hydrant, we expect there’s going to be water,' she said.

U.S. officials signal hope to secure hostage deal in Qatar	Netanyahu approves senior Israeli delegation to leave for Doha talks with Hamas after discussion with American envoys; Israel's Security Cabinet members excluded from negotiations Officials in U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration on Saturday expressed slightly less skepticism about the ongoing negotiations for a hostage deal with Hamas compared to their previous remarks in recent days. They noted progress in the talks, attributing the shift to the arrival of Biden’s Middle East envoy, Brett McGurk, in Qatar. The current goal is to finalize a deal before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20. Trump’s incoming Mid-east envoy Steve Witkoff, who made an unexpected visit to Israel after staying in Doha, conveyed the same message regarding the expected timeline for the hostage deal. The aligned statements from both the Biden and Trump administrations clarify to Hamas that there is no difference in the American position. Last week, members of Biden's team had expressed skepticism about the possibility of reaching a deal soon. This, however, appears to have changed, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed Mossad Director David Barnea, Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar, Maj. Gen. (res) Nitzan Alon and Diplomatic Adviser Ophir Falk to travel to Doha 'to advance negotiations for the release of the hostages.' The decision, following multiple delays of the Israeli delegation’s departure to Qatar, was made during a conference call between Netanyahu, Witkoff and McGurk. After a brief stay in Israel and a meeting with Netanyahu, Witkoff returned to Doha, where the senior Israeli delegation is also expected to arrive. 'This time, there’s optimism and it feels closer than ever,' a senior Israeli official said, but added, 'We’ve been at this point in the past.'

Iran holding war games as it faces Israel tensions, Trump's retur...	Drills are part of two-months-long exercises in which the elite Revolutionary Guards defended key nuclear installations in the country Iran was holding air defense exercises on Saturday, state media reported, as the country braces for more friction with arch-enemy Israel and the United States under incoming U.S. president-elect Donald Trump. The war games take place as Iranian leaders face the risk that Trump could empower Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to attack Iran's nuclear sites, while further tightening U.S. sanctions on its oil industry through his 'maximum pressure' policy. 'In these exercises... defense systems will practice the fight against air, missile and electronic warfare threats in real battlefield conditions... to protect the country's skies and sensitive and vital areas,' Iranian state television said. Saturday's drills are part of two-months-long exercises launched on January 4 which have already included war games in which the elite Revolutionary Guards defended key nuclear installations in Natanz against mock attacks by missiles and drones, state media said. Iran's military has said it was using new drones and missiles in the exercises and released footage of a new underground 'missile city' being visited by Guards Commander-in-Chief Major General Hossein Salami. Iran has recently suffered setbacks in Lebanon after Israeli attacks against Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the toppling of Tehran's ally President Bashar Assad in Syria last month. But Salami warned, in a speech carried by state TV about a 'false sense of delight' among Iran's enemies, saying Iran and particularly its missile forces were stronger than ever. While Iranian officials have downplayed Iran's setbacks, an Iranian general, Behrouz Esbati, who was reportedly based in Syria, said in a speech circulated on social media that Iran had 'badly lost' in Syria.

IDF names four soldiers killed in Gaza blast	Sergeant Major (res.) Alexander Fedorenko, Staff Sergeant Danila Diakov, Sergeant Yahav Maayan and Sergeant Eliav Astuker were killed after a remote explosive detonated in Beit Hanoun; five additional soldiers injured, two in serious condition The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported on Saturday that four soldiers were killed in battle in Gaza’s Beit Hanoun after an explosive device detonated near their vehicle. They are: Sergeant Major (res.) Alexander Fedorenko, 37, from Bat Yam, a Heavy Truck Driver in the 79th Battalion, 14th 'Machatz' Brigade; Staff Sergeant Danila Diakov, 21, from Ma'ale Adumim, a soldier in the 931st Battalion, Nahal Brigade; Sergeant Yahav Maayan, 19, from Modi'in, a soldier in the 931st Battalion, Nahal Brigade and Sergeant Eliav Astuker, aged 19, from Ashdod, a soldier in the 931st Battalion, Nahal Brigade. The troops were killed by the detonation of a powerful explosive device targeting a command vehicle. The unit was traveling along an administrative route in Beit Hanoun, where the brigade has been operating in recent weeks. Five additional soldiers were injured in the incident, including two in serious condition. The route was supposed to be under full operational control, having been cleared at the start of the operation in the city, located west of Sderot. The unit traveled along the route in an unarmored Humvee, accompanied by other light vehicles in the convoy, including one carrying the deputy commander of the Nahal Brigade who was unharmed and led evacuation efforts. During the incident, terrorists opened fire at the unit in the field, though it’s possible the fire was a result of friendly fire. The scene was declared a mass-casualty event.

Terrorists use West Bank mosques to attack soldiers, IDF reports	Troops operating in Jabaliya and Tulkarm encounter terrorists exploiting mosques for cover, weapons storage and mounting attacks against forces The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported on Saturday that forces operating within the West Bank’s Jabaliya and Tulkarm encountered terrorists making use of several mosques and other civilian buildings in the area to mount attacks against troops, risking civilian lives in the process. 'Terrorist activity in Judea and Samaria persistently takes place within civilian infrastructures, including mosques, hospitals, medical centers and educational institutions,' the IDF said in a statement. According to the military, three main mosques were identified as being used by terrorists in Jabaliya and Tulkarm: Jabriyat Mosque and Khalid Ibn al-Walid Mosque in Jenin, and the Abu Bakr al-Siddiq Mosque in Tulkarm. 'During counterterrorism activity conducted in the area of Jenin on 19.11.2024, terrorists opened fire at IDF soldiers from inside and near the Jabriyat Mosque, using it for cover,' the IDF reported. 'The following morning, soldiers returned to the mosque to search it and found a shooting range on the lower floor of the mosque, a training area and shooting positions overlooking the forces and the area adjacent to the mosque. Dozens of bullet shells were located next to every window, left from the gunfire carried out the night before.' 'During the same operational activity, an IAF aircraft identified a large number of armed terrorists firing at IDF soldiers using the Khalid Ibn al-Walid Mosque as cover.' The military added that during operations in Tulkarm, 'an IAF aircraft identified terrorists throwing explosive devices at IDF soldiers from the roof of the Abu Bakr al-Siddiq Mosque.'

Netanyahu approves Israeli delegation to leave for Qatar to advan...	Mossad and Shin Bet chiefs will lead delegation alongside military officials; decision comes following prime minister's meetings with U.S. officials Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a situational assessment meeting on Saturday regarding Israeli hostages held by Hamas and instructed Mossad chief David Barnea, Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar, Maj. Gen. (res.) Nitzan Alon and Diplomatic Advisor Ophir Falk to travel to Doha 'to continue advancing a deal for the release of the hostages.' The announcement was issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, which also noted that the meeting included Defense Minister Israel Katz, senior defense officials and representatives of the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations. Meanwhile, according to sources familiar with the details, 'approximately 90% of the terms for the hostage deal have already been agreed on,' following days of discussions in Qatar. The main point of contention in the talks reportedly revolves around the transition from Phase A (the 'humanitarian' phase) to Phase B of the deal. Hamas, for its part, has refused to provide lists of hostages and has expressed skepticism about the fulfillment of U.S. promises under the incoming U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's administration. Trump, however, has declared that if the hostages are not released by his inauguration on January 20, 'all hell will break out.'

Israel's difficult year in Hollywood	Israeli actors suffer from pro-Palestinian attacks, festivals were either canceled or kept low-profile and Israeli series premieres of Israeli series that were either postponed or kept under the radar Meir Fenigstein, founder and director of the Israel Film Festival in Los Angeles for more than 30 years, was hoping to fill the cinema halls again after the COVID pandemic and its consequences. But then October 7 happened, and it was clear that the festival had to be postponed. 'I thought the war would last two months, tops', said Fenigstein shortly before the opening. 'I postponed it to December, then to March, and when I realized that the war was not going to be over soon, I postponed it to November.' After quite a bit of work, and under a lot of pressure, the Israeli Film Festival in Los Angeles opened with a special screening of Israel's official submission for the Best International Feature Film at the 97th Academy Awards, 'Come Closer' by Tom Nesher. But despite a smooth opening ceremony, the theaters were less keen to cooperate with Israeli work. 'A certain theatre agreed to screen the films, as long as there was no advertisement for the festival outside the hall. Not even one. I could advertise a specific film, but people wouldn't know that it was part of the Israel Film Festival. Even in the lobby of the theater, it was impossible to place anything to suggest that a festival took place inside. 'The owner of the venue told me, 'I want to have the least attention. Inside the theater, you can do whatever you want, but outside - nothing.' They're afraid that frequent visitors to this theater will say, 'Since you're having an Israel film festival, we won't come here anymore. You are traitors.' More difficult and unpleasant Like any other part of our lives, Israeli culture was treated in different ways since October 7. At first, it was surrounded by a sense of mourning and shock. A few months later, when it began to recover a little and tried to break out, it encountered a cultural world that was in part devoid of empathy, partly hostile, and in part refrained from any involvement in what was happening in the Middle East. As a result, it was one of the most difficult years ever for Israeli culture abroad. This holds true for Israeli art and literature, as well as for Israel's most popular cultural export industry – cinema and television, in Hollywood. Hollywood does not boycott Israeli cultural creation, nor has it become antisemitic all of a sudden, as it has a problematic history of antisemitism long before October 7. It can't be claimed that Israeli actors will no longer work in Hollywood. But this year everything has been more difficult, unpleasant, and sometimes heartbreaking. In the first days that followed October 7, the American show-business, Jews and non-Jews alike, stood 100% with Israel. Bono's documentary, dedicating a song in his Las Vegas concert for Israel's 'beautiful kids' massacred at the Nova music festival, was perhaps the best cultural 'Hasbara' moment for Israel in recent years. Later, the support trend shifted. But there is a difference between the attitude prevalent in the world toward Israeli arts and that of the U.S. in general, and certainly Hollywood in particular. Pro-Palestinians will assert that the U.S. film industry still takes Israel's side, and by and large, they are not wrong. The fierce reactions to the Oscar acceptance speech that director Jonathan Glazer made, where he attacked Israel, claiming that 'the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation,' clearly showed that anti-Israel sentiment is rejected by most in Hollywood. 'What happened this year is that the boundaries between Jews and Israelis were blurred after October 7,' says an Israeli actor who works in Hollywood. 'It affected the entire Jewish community in the U.S., which realized that this massacre was against Jews, not just against Israelis, and many Jews in Hollywood were appalled by it. That's why I think that our situation in the industry is safer than what people might think. On the other hand, a younger generation is growing up here, which is much more diverse, racially and ethnically, and the images that have been coming in from Gaza all year were very difficult. They are soon to be the decision-makers here, and I think that when that time comes, it will be more challenging for us here.' The signs of this hardship could be noticed already in the reactions made by certain Hollywood creators not long after October 7. The Writers Guild of America (WGA), for example, maintained complete silence after the horrific October 7 massacre occurred in Gaza border communities; it was a deafening silence, especially in light of the fact that many of its members are Jewish. Dozens of them, however, published a very sharp letter of protest against the union, signed by Jerry Seinfeld, Sacha Baron Cohen, Eric Roth, Matthew Weiner and James Patterson, among others. In terms of the top decision-makers, from studio owners to producers and super-agents, Hollywood is still full of Jews who support Israel. 'I have not faced any problems this year,' says a Jewish executive in the industry. 'On the contrary, I have only received messages of support.' Those who experienced hardship were Israeli creators and actors, because they were judged by their country of origin – and sometimes just by their Jewishness – and paid a price for the pride they took in their origin. Gal Gadot illustrated a fairly accurate picture of the situation in an online conversation with Israel's President Isaac Herzog held at an event to officially launch the 'Kol Ha’am' - Voice of the People - initiative, aiming to promote global Jewish unity. '15 years ago, when I started off, being an Israeli here was something that people were impressed and excited about,' Gadot said. 'I’m not saying that this is not the case today, but now it’s charged, things have changed. I often find myself in awkward situations, having to maintain complex and unpleasant conversations.' Gadot has been experiencing it personally on social media since her breakout role as 'Wonder Woman', but she’s already a big enough star to survive this period without much damage. It’s been much harder for other Israeli actors, though. 'I was at an audition where one of the examiners said straight to my face, ‘The images of what Hamas did on October 7 are haunting me, but I can’t justify anything you do to the Palestinians under the leadership of this prime minister,’' says an Israeli actor. 'I didn’t answer him. It’s better not to say anything now, and rather keep your head down, hoping this wave passes.' The one who’s receiving substantial backlash these days is Israeli actress Noa Cohen, who plays the titular character in Netflix’s film 'Mary'. Pro-Palestinian activists are sharply criticizing director DJ Caruso for choosing a Jewish Israeli actress to play the role of the mother of Jesus, who was herself a Jewish woman living in Israel. 'Not only did the cast lack Arab or a Palestinian representation, but the one playing the role of Mary is Israeli,' protested an X user. Another user wrote: 'The fact that they are casting an Israeli as Mary is profoundly offensive. They are erasing the Palestinian history.' Also, the casting of Israeli actress Shira Haas as the new Marvel superhero 'Sabra' in the Captain America film sparked outrage among pro-Palestinian organizations, prompting Marvel studios to announce it would 'take a new approach with the character Sabra.' There were also reports online claiming that anti-Israel sentiment, induced by the Gaza war, impacted the design of the new character. Some were concerned about the developments, but the new trailer that was recently released included hefty screentime for the character of Haas, and provided some relief in the industry.

It’s not easy to get accepted to the festival, and when it happens, it provides networking opportunities. For some films, it opens the door to widespread distribution and a chance to win the awards granted in Hollywood, for others it opens the door to more modest venues, and sometimes acceptance into such festival brings mainly a sense of relief. That’s what director Shemi Zarhin felt when he heard that his beautiful and human film 'Bliss' was accepted into the festival held in September. This is the second time that a film by Zarhin has participated in Toronto, the previous time being in 2015 with the film 'The Kind Words'; this time he was a bit surprised, given the harsh year for Israeli works worldwide. 'We are known in Toronto,' says Zarhin. 'In a normal situation, I might have expected to be accepted, but this time we were preparing ourselves for a rejection. Even the announcement of the film's acceptance into the festival was postponed until the very last minute, probably to avoid protests as much as possible.' What was the experience like there? 'There were demonstrations during the screenings, both inside and outside the hall. People shouted that 'the film was funded by a state committing genocide'. This was also happening when three or four Palestinian films were being screened at the festival. There was a lot of security. The atmosphere was different than in our previous visit, but the film was screened calmly and beautifully, and the reactions were good, and we left feeling more relaxed.' 'It's true that it's been difficult to be an Israeli filmmaker this year, and usually the representation of Israeli films at festivals is greater, but there is still some hope', added Zarhin. After the screening of 'Bliss' in Toronto we were invited to festivals around the world; I hope this will break the curse,' Zarhin said, anticipating that 'next year will be better for all of us.' The Scripted Israel Conference, which aims to forge connections between Israeli creators and Hollywood TV industry figures, also provided some hope. This year, the closing event, like the previous time, was held at the at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, and it centered around a special screening of the first episode of 'One Day in October', which deals with October 7 massacre. Like the old festival, the relatively new conference also went through a difficult path, certainly more complex than the first year. 'The first conference, held two years ago, celebrated an Israeli television industry that is considered one of the best in the world, certainly in terms of market size and language. We felt like we were the most popular there,' say Tchelet Semel and Daniel Susz, co-founders of the conference. 'The truth is, even back then the attitude toward Israel of more elite circles, like the art world and film festivals, was very different compared to the television industry – where money talks, and where Israel produced 'hits'. The timing also played in our favor, the streamers flourished and the most watched series were international. And now, two years later, we are in a completely different world – both in terms of the industry, and of course, in terms of the situation in Israel.' What does this mean? 'Two years ago we could approach people asking them to invite their colleagues to the conference, and they would be happy to come. Now we turned to specific people, we didn't even try to approach those we knew would refuse, and we used the connections that Israel already had in Hollywood. It's sad, because we want to bring people from the outside, that's actually our goal, to connect the Israeli industry to the U.S. industry here. Last time the conference took place in a shared workspace, and part of the fun was that people could mingle and get to know each other. This year we had to create sterile spaces and make sure that nothing would make the attendees feel uncomfortable.' Despite the difficulties, the conference hosted 56 companies, but Semel and Susz cannot disclose who showed up. 'Unlike last time, now we can't disclose details about the companies and agencies we met. There is a very big difference between people and brands. People are with us, but brands have a hard time connecting with Israel right now - so things had to be done privately. There were also cancellations, people turned pale and apologized, but they had no other choice, the brand wanted nothing to do with us. 'The industry these days is depressed, fearing to take risks. In such a climate, one can do almost nothing. We held our event feeling panic at first, but later we were encouraged to see that things were moving forward, and deals were made. The big question is whether what happened this year was a coincidence induced by the Gaza war or whether there is really a trend of change in Hollywood, along with the generation change, taking into account that those who will run the industry in the future are less fond of Israel.' Shula Spiegel, who co-produced with Dana Eden the successful TV series 'Tehran' attended the conference and left it optimistic. 'I wouldn't say that Israeli content is popular right now, but it's an industry that works for the long run. 'We're getting offers from Netflix until 2026, so there's no need to be worried. I didn't feel like we were being rejected, but many of the participants were Jewish, so maybe that had a bit of an impact on the atmosphere, which was much better than I anticipated. We received only compliments on what we were doing, and the offers I brought started rolling.' Delay after delay The ones who took a serious blow were the Israeli TV series. The Hebrew-language TV series 'Bros,' created by Israelis Hanan Savyon and Guy Amir was acquired by Netflix, scheduled to launch in October 2023. The release was inevitably postponed, and finally went on the air quietly and without a marketing campaign. More than a year ago Netflix also acquired the rights to Israeli TV series 'Border Police', created by Meni Yaish, starring comedian Shalom Michaelshvili and singer Shlomi Shabbat, but it has not yet been distributed for broadcast worldwide as previously planned. Another series that has been significantly delayed was 'Tehran', by Apple TV+ and Israel’s Kan public broadcaster. The third season of the award-winning espionage thriller was supposed to air in March, but Apple vetoed it due to the ongoing war, until it was finally aired in early December. Even before they announced that there would be no more delays, Spiegel was not much bothered: 'We can understand that. I didn't feel like they were turning their backs on us, the fact is that we are already writing the fourth season. The appreciation and respect for the Israeli industry has not changed. Our successes are being acknowledged, and we know that we are professionals, but it has been a difficult year for everyone, including us.' Figures in the industry explain that it is difficult to market Israeli works today. 'It’s very, very challenging, certainly a series like ‘Tehran,’' says a senior executive at a major streamer. 'It’s hard to promote it right now. I know that there's a new season of ‘Fauda' in progress, and I hope that by the time it’s ready for international broadcast, all of this will be behind us.' But if you ask Adam Berkowitz who was co-head of the television department at leading entertainment and sports agency Creative Artists Agency (CAA), and later founder of Lenore Entertainment Group, thinks that Israel has no particular problem in Hollywood. Berkowitz works with many of the world’s leading television producers, writers, and directors. He has been instrumental in packaging and selling critically acclaimed Israeli series including 'Losing Alice' to Apple TV+, 'Fauda' to Netflix and 'Rehearsals' to Hulu. When asked if there is an increase in pro-Palestinian impact on Hollywood, he laughs. 'There’s nothing like that. There’s a problem with foreign content in general now, it’s not related to Israeli content. Everyone is looking for material in English.' So, is this just Israeli paranoia? 'It's true that there is a problem with film festivals, and it’s more challenging to sell shows that feel political, but it’s not something that can’t be overcome. It’s an industry that has its ups and downs, but I’ve sold many Israeli series, I’m about to sell more, and I don’t think there’s any reason to worry.' Separation between Judaism and Israel If there’s one thing Hollywood has been careful to do this year, even more so than before, is to separate Judaism from Israel, even artificially if necessary. This is particularly evident in the Netflix hit 'Nobody Wants This.' The comedic drama about the romantic journey of a young rabbi and a beautiful, non-Jewish woman, 'Nobody Wants This' perpetuates Jewish stereotypes in a way that somehow can be acceptable, but it is very careful not to mention Israel in any family or ceremonial scenes. It’s a complete misrepresentation of Jewish life in America, especially in the last year, but Hollywood has always had a hard time dealing with Jewish representation, even regardless of Israel, and this year has only aggravated the problem. The difficulty was particularly apparent when The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences opened last fall. The acknowledgement of the contribution of the Jewish immigrants who founded Hollywood was conspicuously absent. It would have looked very bad any year, but this year in particular. After extensive criticism, the Museum opened a new permanent exhibit titled 'Hollywoodland: Jewish Founders and the Making of a Movie Capital'. It took less than two weeks until it was met with blowback, stating that the content of the exhibition was antisemitic, and the museum was forced to make exhibit changes, eliminating the 'phrasing that may unintentionally reinforce stereotypes.' But perhaps the most notable case in which Judaism, antisemitism, and support for Israel have mingled was that of actress Julianna Margulies, star of 'The Good Wife.' Margulies has become one of the most outspoken activists in the fight against antisemitism in Hollywood this year, and she had great influence because of her affiliation to the liberal side of political spectrum. She attacked, among others, the pro-Palestinian protesters, saying that a large portion of them were blacks, and they should embrace the Jews because in the civil rights movements, the Jews were the ones who walked side by side with the blacks. She also attacked pro-Palestinian LGBT protesters in a statement that caused a huge uproar, for which she eventually apologized. Seven months after Margulies stood up for Israel, it was announced that she will not return to Apple TV+‘s ‘The Morning Show’ for Season 4. Sources at Apple TV + said that the decision was made before her controversial comments. Either way, coincidentally or not, Margulies is appearing on Broadway – far away from Hollywood. One thing everyone agrees on is that Hollywood knows how to distinguish the difference between support for Israel and what people think of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In May, super-agent Ari Emanuel, who inspired a character on the TV series 'Entourage', received an award from the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Emanuel who is one of the most powerful figures in Hollywood took advantage of the event to express support for the war against Hamas, but also to deliver harsh criticism of Netanyahu. 'Netanyahu doesn’t want a peaceful solution, and it’s become clear that getting to a political solution and Netanyahu remaining in power are irreconcilable paths', stated Emanuel. 'As for his responsibilities to keep the people of the State of Israel and Jews across the globe safe, he has obviously failed spectacularly. But he has succeeded wildly in using division to stay in power. For the good of Israel, he should go.' Those remarks by Emanuel drew both applause and boos, as well as some departures from the gala. But ultimately, the event proves a very central point for American Jews – no matter what they think of the government or its leader, criticizing Israel is still considered taboo. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sjhqk8kukg	2025-01-11T08:08:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/19/B1x9J00JcMJx/B1x9J00JcMJx_475_330_840_473_0_small.jpg

Iran reveals underground missile base | watch	Base located in the mountains and missiles kept there were used to attack Israel, Iranian news agency says; IRGC says developing missile with new capabilities to defend Islamic Republic Iran revealed an underground missile base for the first time on Friday. Hossein Salami, the head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), visited the base, state TV reported airing images of the top commander touring the facility in an undisclosed location. The report said the underground base was 'located in the mountains' and had been used to launch a missile attack at Tehran's regional foe Israel. According to the semi-official Mahr news agency in Iran, the missiles stored in the facility were used in Iran's attacks on Israel in April and October of last year. Salami who was speaking at an IRGC event said his force was working on developing new type of missiles that will have special capabilities, as part of the strengthening of Iran's defenses. The television broadcast showing the underground base came hours after thousands of members of the IRGC and members of Basij, a paramilitary militia, participated in a military parade in Tehran. According to a report in the Iranian Tasnim news agency, the event included an exhibition of a military drill by Basij fighters with the participation of 110,000 members of the reserves.

Trump mid-east envoy arrives on surprise visit, to meet Netanyahu	PMS says slow progress made in negotiations for a hostage release deal and Mossad chief Barnea may leave for Doha with Shin Bet chief Bar, soon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet on Saturday with Steve Witkoff, U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's Mideast envoy, in Jerusalem. Witkoff arrived on a surprise visit earlier. Before the meeting was announced, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said there had been slow progress made in negotiations for a new hostage release deal. According to officials in the PMO, Mossad chief David Barnea may leave to join the talks in Doha soon, although no official announcement was made. Barnea was scheduled to leave for Qatar earlier in the week but has not yet been given the greenlight from Netanyahu. He may be joined by Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar. Israel officials refuses to confirm or deny that any progress was made and said repeatedly in the past 24 hours, that negotiations are being held amid a media blackout. Witkoff arrived to join the negotiations in Doha on Tuesday, where according to sources, 90% of the points negotiated have been agreed. There is still disagreement over the transition from the first phase of the deal – which will include release of hostages in a humanitarian exchange - to phase two. Qatari mediators have complained that although there was agreement by all parties to keep the details of the negotiations out of the media, each side had briefed reporters on the matters still in dispute.

Syrian intelligence says it thwarted Islamic State attack on Shi'...	Foiled attack stokes fears that ISIS was hoping to stage a comeback in Syria; new rulers say will protect religious minorities 'in all their diversity' Syria's Intelligence Directorate foiled an attack by the Islamic State group on the Sayeda Zeinab shrine in a Damascus suburb, a site of mass pilgrimage for Shi'ites, state news agency Sana reported on Saturday. It said members of the cell were arrested before they could detonate an explosion inside the shrine. The foiled attack will stoke fears that Islamic State is hoping to stage a comeback in Syria following the fall last month of President Bashar al-Assad. Some Syrians and foreign powers have worried that the country's new leaders, who are from the Sunni Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that forced Assad out on Dec. 8, may impose strict Islamic governance on a country with numerous minority groups such as Druze, Kurds, Christians and Shi'ites. But the announcement by Syria's de facto government that it thwarted an attack targeting Shi'ite Muslims comes amid reassurances it will protect religious minorities. 'The General Intelligence Directorate is utilizing all its resources to confront all attempts to target the Syrian people in all their diversity,' an intelligence official told Sana. Islamic State, the Sunni Muslim militant group, has claimed previous attacks in and around the shrine, including last year and a bombing in 2017 that killed at least 40 people. The granddaughter of the Prophet Mohammad, Sayeda Zeinab is venerated by Shi'ite Muslims and the mosque and shrine 10 kilometers south of Damascus attracts Shi'ite pilgrims from around the region.

Hind RIjab Foundation member barred from pro-Palestine conference	European Palestinian Network disinvites the representative of HRF after other participants in its first conference refuse to participate with him in the same panel because of the group's affiliation with Hezbollah and Hamas The European Palestinian Network (EPN) on Friday canceled the participation of the representative of the Hind Rijab Foundation (HRF) in the first joint conference in Denmark, following Israeli pressure and the refusal of other participant to sit in the same panel with HRF's representative Haroon Raza, a Netherlands-based lawyer. According to the organizers the conference will gather experts, organizations, inspiring and influential personalities, and individuals from all over Europe. with the aim 'to share and broaden our knowledge and to strengthen European civil, intellectual, and professional unity around freedom, rights, and justice for Palestine.' HRF, which has been hunting IDF soldiers around the world and lodging legal complaints against them for alleged war crimes said in a post that Mr. Raza had already traveled to Copenhagen for the conference. The HRF blamed Israel's 'lies' in a post on X. 'Information disseminated in the Israeli press, falsely linking us to resistance movements in Lebanon and Palestine. Some invitees refused to share a panel with the HRF. So the organization decided to cancel Mr. Raza,' the post read. 'We deeply regret this outcome and wish to emphasize that the Hind Rajab Foundation is an independent organization, legally recognized under Belgian law. While our officials and volunteers are entitled to their personal views, our sole mission remains the pursuit of justice and accountability for the victims and perpetrators of this ongoing genocide.' The groups said that in future, it would 'decline all invitations to participate in events or conferences.'

From combat to the classroom: Nahal soldiers rebuild lives along ...	After the October 7 attacks, Nahal soldiers who fought in Gaza have transitioned to rebuilding border communities; Now part of the Education Corps, they mentor youth, strengthen resilience, and share firsthand experiences of war to inspire meaningful combat service The meeting takes place at the old water tower in Be'erot Yitzhak, about 1.2 miles from the 1950 armistice line, the border of the Gaza Strip. Now, they wear military uniforms with the insignia of the Education Corps, without their personal weapons, but still with the green berets of the Nahal Brigade. Until recently, Itay (21), Shahar (22), Ofek (21), and Ori (23) were fighting inside Gaza. In recent months, they have transitioned to roles in education across the regional councils of Eshkol and Sdot Negev, in the city of Netivot, and in communities heavily impacted by the events of October 7. The four are soldiers from the Nahal Brigade who now belong to the Education Corps. They are part of Garin (a group of youth from the same program) in the 50th Battalion, which makes up about a quarter of the battalion's combat soldiers. They volunteered for a year prior to their military service and are now engaging in an additional volunteer year near the end of their service, known as the 'mission phase.' The group of soldiers currently in the mission phase—including Itay, Shahar, Ofek, and Ori—finds themselves closing an emotional circle as their volunteer efforts are taking place in the Gaza border region. Their mission in the Education Corps includes, among other things, encouraging youth to join meaningful combat service, helping rehabilitate the area, and strengthening resilience and morale in Israel's western Negev region. 'We're without weapons now, and in the end, that's the swagger of being a combat soldier,' says Staff Sergeant Ori Navon (23). 'Suddenly, I look like a desk job soldier, but that doesn't mean the mission we're doing now is any less important.' Ori, previously a combat soldier in the infantry company of 50th Battalion, is now completing his mission phase in the Sdot Negev Regional Council, in the village of Yoshivia. 'If I had entered the mission phase before the war,' he adds, 'it wouldn't have been the same as it is after what I experienced in Gaza. We need to help these communities rebuild. They've been through a lot of battles, things have been burned. Now there's a need for education because many students were evacuated and haven't been in school for a long time.' Staff Sergeant Ofek Cohen from Ashdod says, 'There's something very emotional about having fought here and now rebuilding homes.' Cohen, also a former combat soldier in the 50th Battalion's operational company, is now working with youth in the Eshkol Regional Council. 'We were the barrier between the terrorists and the residents here, and now we're working with them,' he shares. 'We're rebuilding homes and mentoring kids. For some people, the concept of soldiers in the Education Corps is a bit strange, but they're starting to understand it. 'There's nothing more meaningful than being a combat soldier. That's what has to be done,' Cohen adds. 'But we truly have the privilege of coming from that background as educators—to help affected communities. In the end, I stand in front of them and explain what combat is. I was as combat as it gets. I experienced war.' 'It's a drastic change to suddenly become a teacher' The four soldiers fought in Gaza from the very beginning of the war. They were in the thick of the battles and even lost comrades, including Ido Epel, Ori Bar-Or, and Amir Galilov. Staff Sergeant Shahar Dekel from Nof HaGalil and Staff Sergeant Itay Kanfo from Tzur Hadassah served together in the operational company of the 50th Battalion. Now, they live together in Netivot, working with students in schools and after-school programs, and conducting fitness training with teenagers. Early in the war, on the third day of the maneuver into Gaza, Shahar and Itay faced a traumatic event. 'We were advancing towards Shati,' recalls Itay, a medic. 'We crossed an open kill zone, and there was a tank providing cover for us. It was hit by an anti-tank missile, and we saw it burn. A wounded soldier was brought to us, and I treated him. I surprised myself with how calm I was and how I managed to function. I told him to focus on me and not on his injury until we connected with the medical team. In the end, I was satisfied with how I performed. In an instant, you're in a movie.' Shahar shares, 'Everything felt normal to us, like training. The training prepared me really well. It's a drastic change to suddenly become a teacher.' Ori, also a combat medic, recalls the incident in which he lost three comrades from his company in Rafah. 'It was in May, a mass casualty event,' he recounts. 'The battalion took over a school, and adjacent to it was a clinic with an explosive device that detonated. I treated the wounded, who were my friends in the company. Ido, Ori, and Amir, who were killed, were also close friends of mine.' 'Education and combat go hand in hand' The name of the Nahal Brigade is an acronym for 'Fighting Pioneer Youth Framework.' It has its roots in the early days of the state, with the establishment of Nahal groups. The 50th Battalion was previously a paratrooper battalion associated with the Paratroopers Brigade, where Shahar Dekel's grandfather also served. 'My grandfather told me he fought in the Six-Day War, Yom Kippur War, and Lebanon,' he says. 'And in the end, cumulatively, I fought more days than he did. Education and combat go hand in hand. If we don't educate, there won't be a state here. And if we don't fight, there also won't be a state here.' Itay adds, 'Because of the war, this has more meaning. Experiencing war is something else; it's something our generation hasn't gone through. I tell the youth about it firsthand. It's historic that we got to be part of something so significant.' 'This ain't no Fortnite' There are a total of 220 soldiers from the Education Corps working in the Gaza border region. Twenty-eight of them are from the 50th Battalion, alongside fighters from the Caracal Battalion. IDF's Home Front Command decided on October 15 to take responsibility for the evacuees. Almost all its forces were deployed to the south to help establish educational systems in evacuated areas, as well as in the north. In January, IDF decided to establish a unit called 'Magal VeHerev' (Shield and Sword) to continue providing support in education, security, and settlement efforts, even as residents return to their homes. Ofek: 'I don't tell any student that being a combat soldier is easy. I present the difficulties. In the end, it has to be conveyed that if you become a combat soldier, you could get hurt.' Abraham (14), a student from Netivot, says, 'Itay is a great guy. We play ping-pong and talk.' When asked if he knows that Itay was a combat soldier, he looks surprised. 'Wow,' he says. 'That takes courage to go in there. It's not a video game. This ain't no Fortnite. My dream is to join Unit Oketz (IDF K-9 Unit).' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ofek: 'They're surprised because suddenly a soldier without a weapon tells them he was a fighter. I'm the face they see behind what it means to be a combat soldier.' Shahar: 'We have a student who's really in trouble with the police. We managed to sit with him for two hours and prepare him for his initial draft interview. At one point, I told him, 'Let's play ping-pong.' He told me, 'No, no, we need to prepare.' These are small moments.' Itay shares: 'I had a kid who suddenly asked me to tell him what I did in the war. I started telling him, and he really wanted to know everything.' Do you have any doubts or dilemmas about whether you've done enough, and why you're now expected to educate as well? Ofek: 'The war is still ongoing, so we don’t have the right to take a break. Should I push the students? We all faced difficulties during the war, and I don’t tell any student that being a combat soldier is easy. I present the challenges. In the end, it has to be conveyed that if you’re a combat soldier, you can get hurt. You need both—education and combat. IDF has the ability to do both. I don’t know if there’s another army in the world that does this. Talking about these things is important.' Captain Yuval Mana, the platoon commander of the four, says during the conversation that the mantra given to the soldiers was, 'Until now, you destroyed and dismantled infrastructure; now it's time to build. Until now, you were engaged in very different activities, and transitioning is definitely not easy. We are a country that needs to build as well. That is what you are doing.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sym0cgnujx	2025-01-10T23:19:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/04/yk14211402/yk14211402_0_133_946_532_0_small.jpg
The men behind HRF hunting IDF soldiers	Dyab Abou Jahjah and Karim Hassoun natives of Lebanon and proud supporters of Hezbollah and Hamas currently live in Belgium, are involved in local politics and vow to continue going after soldiers they accuse of war crimes The Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) announced on Friday that it has lodged a complaint in Finland, Denmark and Norway against an IDF soldier alleging war crimes. A similar complaint was made in Sweden against the soldier and the HRF said he may attempt to cross borders into neighboring countries. We call on the authorities of those countries to prevent the soldiers attempt to escape justice,' the fund said in its complaint. There are reports nearly on a daily basis now, of IDF soldiers in danger of arrest and prosecution for war crimes, when abroad. Only the countries they are, have changed. The pro-Palestinian organization has already led to an IDF soldier having to escape Brazil, it had lodged complaints in Chile, Argentina, and Thailand. The two men who established HRF are natives of Lebanon who now reside in Belgium and according to reports on Friday, one had been ousted from his political party and the other said in a post, that he would not be deterred from going after IDF soldiers. The Hind Rajab Foundation is an offshoot of the March 30 movement established by Palestinians in Europe at the start of the war. It was named after a Palestinian six year old girl who the founders claimed was killed by the IDF when traveling in a car, on January 29, 2024, with her family. The Ministry of Diaspora Affairs published a report with details about its founders, Dyab Abou Jahjah and Karim Hassoun. Abou Jahjah was borne in the South Lebanon town of Hanin and said he had joined Hezbollah in his youth, to fight Israel and had received military training. He was granted Belgium citizenship in 1996, after marrying a citizen of the country, whom he later divorced. In an article published over 20 years ago, he was described as a Palestinian Malcolm X in the Muslim migrant community. In 2000, Abou Jahjah founded 'The Arab European League' (AEL) that was active in Belgium and the Netherlands to promote Arab nationalism, Nasserism, and anti-Zionism and the stated aim of 'facilitating the integration of Muslims in Europe', according to the ministry's report. He described the 9/11/2001 terror attacks in the United States as 'Sweet revenge.' A Dutch court fined the AEL in 2010 for publishing a cartoon claiming Jews provoked the Holocaust. Abou Jahjah was involved in complaints lodged against Israel in Belgium. In 2002 he participated in a suit against then prime minister Ariel Sharon, accusing him of war crimes and involvement in the Sabra and Shatila massacre of Palestinians in Beirut during the First Lebanon War. A year later, he was barred from entry to the UK over his extreme views. Over the years Abou Jahjah published many articles in the Hezbollah-affiliated Al Akhbar newspaper in Lebanon, where he expressed his support for Hamas and Hezbollah. During the war, he initiated complaints against an IDF soldier who has Dutch citizenship, along with other members of the IDF, accusing them of war crimes. Lat in 2023, he called on his followers on social media, to identify IDF soldiers who hold European citizenship, to advance legal action against them. In a long post last week, Abou Jahjah wrote ' When I decided to pursue justice against Israeli war criminals, I understood the consequences…My resolve remains unchanged. After witnessing this genocide, there is no turning back. In the face of such grave injustice, the perpetrators must be held accountable. Justice is the only path forward—not revenge, not violence, but justice through the courts of law.' Karim Hassoun the second founder of HRF was also born in Lebanon and is currently a resident of Belgium. He has been chairman of the AEL since 2005. In an interview he gave in 2009 he said the chances that his organization would recognize Israel were as good as the chance that Osama Bin Laden would become president of the United States. 'We will never recognize a racist colonialist country,' he said. On October 8, 2023, just one day after the Hamas massacre he said in a post that the Palestinians did not invade Israel, they simply returned home to claim their property. When asked if he would condemn Hamas after the massacre, he said he condemned the group for not taking 500 or 1,000 hostages instead of only 200. Hassoun was elected to the Willebroek city council in the province of Antwerp. But ended up not serving on the council after demands from the local Jewish community. The European Jewish Agency (EJA) praised the decision to ban Hassoun from the council because of his support for Hamas and Hezbollah. 'He imports antisemitism into the streets of Europe,' the EJA envoy and Belgium member of parliament Michael Freilich.

US House votes to sanction International Criminal Court over Isra...	Senators vote 243 to 140 in favor of the 'Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act,' which would sanction any foreigner who investigates, arrests, detains or prosecutes U.S. citizens or those of an allied country, not a member of the court The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Thursday to sanction the International Criminal Court in protest at its arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister over Israel's campaign in Gaza. The vote was 243 to 140 in favor of the 'Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act,' which would sanction any foreigner who investigates, arrests, detains or prosecutes U.S. citizens or those of an allied country, including Israel, who are not members of the court. Forty-five Democrats joined 198 Republicans in backing the bill. No Republican voted against it. 'America is passing this law because a kangaroo court is seeking to arrest the prime minister of our great ally, Israel,' Representative Brian Mast, Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a House speech before the vote. The House vote, one of the first since the new Congress was seated last week, underscored strong support among President-elect Donald Trump's fellow Republicans for Israel's government, now that they control both chambers in Congress. The ICC said it noted the bill with concern and warned it could rob victims of atrocities of justice and hope. 'The court firmly condemns any and all actions intended to threaten the court and its officials, undermine its judicial independence and its mandate and deprive millions of victims of international atrocities across the world of justice and hope,' it said in a statement sent to Reuters. Trump's first administration imposed sanctions on the ICC in 2020 in response to investigations into war crimes in Afghanistan, including allegations of torture by U.S. citizens. Those sanctions were lifted by President Joe Biden's administration, though Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in May last year that it was willing to work with Congress to potentially impose new sanctions on the ICC over the prosecutor's request for arrest warrants for Israeli leaders. Five years ago, then-ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and other staff had credit cards and bank accounts frozen and U.S. travel impeded. ICC watchers said the new sanctions would make it possible to target individuals assisting the work of the court. 'The bill is also broad because anyone who provides support to the court on any case exposes themselves to sanctions,' Milena Sterio, international law expert at Cleveland State University, told Reuters. Sanctions could 'jeopardize' ICC its president says In December, the court's president, judge Tomoko Akane, told the ICC's 125 member nations that 'these measures would rapidly undermine the Court's operations in all situations and cases and jeopardize its very existence'. Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20 for a second term as president. The Senate's newly appointed Republican majority leader, John Thune, has promised swift consideration of the sanctions act in his chamber so that Trump can sign it into law shortly after taking office. The ICC is a permanent court that can prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression in member states or by their nationals.

If you were detained on October 7, as far as I’m concerned, you ...	More than 15 months after October 7, the police and prosecutors still handle countless terrorists' cases, aiming for indictment over terror charges while understaffed Just before the war, attorney Moran Gez, 46, was planning to leave the Southern District Prosecutor’s Office and dreaming of starting her own private practice. 'Then October 7 happened, and I immediately told myself, ‘Put your plans aside.’ I sent a message to the district attorney: ‘I’m here. Whatever is needed, I’ll do it.’' Gez, a prosecutor with over 20 years of experience, had recently overseen security-related cases in the Southern District. She led high-profile cases, including the murder trial of Ron Kokia, who was killed in 2017 by Khaled Abu Jaudah, later sentenced to life in prison. Her last security case involved ten defendants, both Israelis and West Bank residents, accused of attempting to form a terrorist cell aimed at attacking Israelis and assassinating National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. An indictment was filed this past April, but the trial has yet to begin. Gez was one of four attorneys appointed to a specialized October 7 legal task force. 'When I was sent to the first meeting at Lahav 433 with all the investigation teams working on the issue, I walked into a huge hall. There were maybe 50 people there—members of the National Fraud Unit, the Anti-Corruption Unit, the Serious Crimes Unit, Etgar and Unit 103. They came prepared. Each one had a specific area of responsibility, a designated task. They were completely ready. And I looked around and thought, 'Wow, we’re just four prosecutors handling this.' At that point, we already knew there were 1,100 victims and hostages. How could we possibly manage this? It was overwhelming.' Gez criticized the slow pace of the process, citing several reasons: a lack of manpower in the prosecution, delays in enacting necessary legislative changes and an absence of solutions for the enormous number of potential defendants. 'When we started dealing with this, we were told indictments would be filed within a year, but even now, no decision has been made. From colleagues and lawyers involved, I hear it’s still far off. Meanwhile, the detention of the terrorists is extended every few months. Now it’s been extended until March next year. I don’t see indictments on the horizon.' 'There was also a sense that the state didn’t believe it needed to allocate additional manpower to the prosecution for this task. So, they pulled two prosecutors from each district office because we couldn’t handle the workload. Today, the team has grown to about 20 prosecutors, but most of the original prosecutors from other districts who handled these cases from the start eventually left—like me.' The blood must not cool The biggest challenge is evidence, Gez explains. Linking specific crimes to specific suspects, across dozens of crime scenes involving hundreds of suspects and thousands of offenses, is nearly impossible. 'Standard rules of evidence don’t fit this situation. There are no organized chains of evidence, and there’s no one to verify the videos you want to present in court. 'Legislative amendments are needed; otherwise, it’s impossible to handle these cases. But even legislative changes can’t be applied retroactively, so that won’t fully resolve the issue. What’s needed is a comprehensive legislative reform regarding evidence to allow for filing indictments. I hope that’s being worked on, but everything is moving far too slowly.' So what’s the solution? 'In the end, you need a confession in a case like this. You need each individual to recount their role to build a complete narrative of the location—how many terrorists were there, what they did, what the premeditated plan was and how far in advance they knew about it. All of this is crucial from an evidentiary standpoint. 'But surprisingly, in the interrogations of these terrorists, they try to downplay the nationalist aspect. From my experience with security cases, most terrorists are very proud of what they’ve done and don’t hide it; they even openly tell investigators they’re proud. On October 7, you could see from the GoPro footage how motivated and ideologically driven they were. Yet, in practice, most of the terrorists from October 7 turned out to be cowards. In the interrogations, no one admits to actually shooting: ‘I fired and missed,’ ‘I was injured as soon as I entered the post,’ ‘My weapon jammed.’ I’m not used to seeing terrorists behave this way.' One reason for delaying prosecutions is the effort not to jeopardize the chances of the hostages’ return. Another reason is the concern that Palestinians and European human rights organizations might ramp up initiatives for legal countermeasures against Israel. In the meantime, alternatives are being considered, such as establishing a special tribunal for the massacre’s perpetrators or granting jurisdiction over the matter to the military court in Lod, which was closed in 2000 and previously dealt with cases involving threats to national security. 'The best option would have been to establish the military court,' says Gez. 'But a different decision was made. We also need to think about who will represent these individuals in the end. How will the trials be conducted? Individually? And how will you bring them to court? You’ll need a hundred attorneys, and there are conflicts of interest. These are issues that need careful consideration. 'At that first meeting, the head of Lahav 433 [Israel Police’s serious crime unit] asked me, ‘What should the indictment look like?’ I told him, ‘What do you mean, what? Anyone who crossed from Gaza into Israel on October 7—whether to kill or loot, it doesn’t matter—should be included in the indictment and, as far as I’m concerned, receive the death penalty.’ 'Why? Because those who didn’t kill but looted, burned, stole or even picked avocados, as some claim, stirred such chaos that held back the IDF from arriving on time. If you came with a drill to open a door for looting, and then a terrorist entered and murdered civilians, the state should hold everyone accountable. We won’t succeed in sorting these people out because they all contributed to this massacre in the end, even if the conspiracy was spontaneous and only happened when they breached the border. And I must say, everyone in that discussion supported this approach.' It was two weeks later. The blood was still boiling. 'I don’t think the blood should have cooled during the time that’s passed. We need to remind ourselves of the horrors that happened there. I’ve completely lost any compassion for these people. It doesn’t matter what you did—if you were detained on October 7, as far as I’m concerned, you have no right to live. You won’t find an ounce of mercy in me. I’m sorry. 'In past security cases I handled, there were Gaza residents accused of more ‘civil’ offenses, like smuggling. Those were people I felt sympathy for—individuals trying to support their families and even bringing equipment into hospitals. But those same hospitals ended up receiving the hostages and hiding terrorists. On October 7, we saw crowds in Gaza dancing on corpses, and so the compassion diminishes.' So, the death penalty for everyone? 'As far as I’m concerned, yes. Today, there are offenses that allow for the death penalty, like aiding the enemy during war, harming sovereignty or causing war. But legally, we’ve only done it once (against Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann, who was tried and executed in Israel). Honestly, I don’t think there’s any chance of someone here filing an indictment seeking the death penalty, and I don’t think there’s any chance a court would impose it.' Sleeping with the testimonies Gez’s role primarily involved reviewing the investigation materials related to the terrorists. 'A terrorist’s name would come up, and I would go through the initial materials and the suspicions against them to determine which location they were connected to. For example, if a terrorist mentioned seeing the sign for Sderot, I would piece it together and figure out what follow-up investigations were needed. We created an investigative protocol for the police, and then the case would be passed on to a prosecutor to summarize the findings. As the number of terrorists grew, it became harder for me to keep track of them all. 'At night, I would sit there like a junky, reading the materials. My parents, my ex-husband—everyone pitched in to take care of the kids. I would come home late, sit in bed and read the new reports that had come in. More and more and more. It became my entire life. Testimonies from ZAKA, the Chief Rabbinate, the women who washed the bodies. And when I wasn’t reading, I was watching the news on TV, looking for clues on where further investigation was needed. It felt endless, something so massive it was impossible to control. I would go to sleep with the testimonies and videos on my mind, constantly afraid that if I didn’t read everything, I wouldn’t know what was missing. 'It was the small things that shook me the most. I saw a video of a mother with her children in a safe room. The child was young, about the same age as my son. You see him bleeding, and she’s whispering to him that everything will be okay. And you can see it won’t be. It’s not okay. She loses him, utterly helpless, unable to do anything except record and whisper softly. 'At some point, I developed fears. I ordered window bars for my home, even though I thought, ‘What good will bars do?’ Strangely, when I visited the Gaza border communities, it actually calmed me down. It showed me that survival was possible.' They are placed in the category of unlawful combatants, under administrative detention, with their detention extended every six months because there aren’t enough prosecutors to handle these investigations. She was also responsible for handling sexual offenses. 'Unfortunately, it will be very difficult to prove these crimes,' she says. 'In the end, we don’t have complainants. What was reported in the media compared to what will ultimately be established will look very different—either because the victims were murdered or because women who were raped are unwilling to come forward. 'We reached out to women’s rights organizations and requested cooperation. They told us no one had contacted them. Some parents reached out to these organizations, asking what to do if something happened to their daughters, but they didn’t disclose the assaults. 'In this area, I would temper expectations. I know the public is expecting action and understands the need to address the horrific sexual offenses and assaults that occurred, but the vast majority of these cases won’t meet the evidentiary threshold in court, and the criticism will ultimately fall on the prosecution—unjustly so.' The already overwhelming workload was further compounded by detainees captured after IDF forces entered Gaza. 'The issue of maneuver detainees—people who planted explosives, killed soldiers, fired rockets, killed civilians and confessed to it—isn’t being addressed right now. They are placed in the category of unlawful combatants, under administrative detention, with their detention extended every six months because there aren’t enough prosecutors to handle these investigations. 'They are interrogated by the police, but no prosecutor is reviewing the material, requesting follow-ups or completing the investigations. If at some point, years from now, the prosecution has time to deal with these cases, any follow-ups will be irrelevant. In other words, these individuals will likely never face trial and won’t be held accountable for their actions—and that’s simply the result of the decision not to allocate additional budget or positions to the prosecution, which is already stretched to its limit.' Seven complainants a week Gez is one of more than ten prosecutors who left the Southern District Attorney’s Office in the past year—one of the most overburdened legal bodies in Israel following the October 7 massacre. This departure comes despite the recent addition of eight new positions to the office, which are still insufficient to handle the workload in a district that covers more than 60% of the country’s land area. Despite her frustration with the job, Gez achieved significant milestones. In the high-profile attempted murder case of Shira Isakov, where she served as prosecutor, she established a precedent that will impact future domestic violence cases. Aviad Moshe, Isakov’s ex-husband, was sentenced to 23 years in prison after being convicted of attempted murder and child abuse—despite not physically harming his son. On October 6 of this year, exactly one year after the war began, Gez opened a private law practice with a colleague. 'For years, I had no life. I was working under insane pressure. The work in the prosecution is exhausting and intense. There was a time I had to interview seven underage complainants in a single week. That’s not normal. You can’t prepare for court that way. And in the end, this is a matter of life and death—both for the defendant, whose entire future is at stake, and for the complainant. Many times, I felt that no matter what I did or how late I worked, I couldn’t do my job the way I wanted. I just couldn’t take it anymore.

The situation keeps getting worse, and it’s a vicious cycle—fewer people share the burden, more people collapse under the pressure, and even fewer want to stay in the prosecution. But you can’t only blame the system. October 7 also made people rethink their lives and what they want to do—to spend more time with their kids and families. Because you see how, in an instant, everything can disappear.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1hdxem81g	2025-01-10T12:52:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/rJHXyjFS1x/rJHXyjFS1x_0_0_708_472_0_small.jpg
High alert for Houthi retaliation after IDF strike on Yemen	IDF strikes Haziz power plant near Sanaa, Hodeidah and Ras Isa Ports, as well as missile launchers; Senior Houthi official threatens a major response in Hebrew The Israeli air defense systems are on high alert expecting a Houthi response to Friday's strike on Yemeni infrastructure. This was the Air Force's fifth attack in Yemen since October 7 but the first joint American attack. That attack came a day after the intercept of three drones launched from the east at Israeli territory, and after the Houthis had already launched more than 40 surface-to-surface missiles and 320 drones since the outbreak of the war. More than 20 Air Force aircraft took part in the attack, traveling about 2,000 km from Israel to Yemen, and dropping about 50 munitions on three main targets. The fighter jets carried out operational refueling in midair, en route to the targets. In the footage published by the IDF, the F-16s that attacked Yemen are visible in the skies of the Middle East, and the moment of the refueling in the air – carried out by a Boeing 707. A representative of CENTCOM, the United States Central Command, was in the Israeli Air Force’s attack cell, to ensure maximum coordination. The IDF spokesperson said that among the targets was the Haziz power plant, which serves as a central electricity infrastructure for the Houthi regime, as well as the ports of Ras Isa and Hodeidah on Yemen's western coast. The attack on the power plant near Sanaa occurred during the huge weekly demonstration against Israel held in the capital. A Sanaa resident told Ynet that most neighborhoods in the city were cut off from electricity due to the attack on the power plant. Defense Minister Israel Katz followed the attacks in Yemen from the Air Force command center along with the air force commander, Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar, and other senior officials. 'The IDF's attack today in Yemen is a clear and unequivocal message to the leader of the Houthi terrorist organization, Abd al-Malik al-Houthi, and the leaders of the Houthi terrorist organization in Yemen: There will be no immunity for anyone. We will pursue and hunt you down and destroy the terror infrastructure you have established.' Katz further said: 'Israel's long hand will catch up with you everywhere. Thousands of Houthis who participated in a hate march against Israel heard the power of the Air Force planes up close. The port of Hodeidah is paralyzed and the port of Ras Isa is burning, and the message is clear: whoever harms Israel will be harmed sevenfold.' Another Israeli official threatened the Houthi leadership, saying that it 'will have to decide whether it wants to end up like the leadership of Hezbollah and Hamas.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: An Israeli senior official said, 'other countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are happy with this.' After the attacks, senior Houthi leader Hazam al-Assad tweeted in Hebrew on X. 'What the enemy does not understand is that its aggression has strengthened the unity of the Yemenis in an unprecedented way, and the Yemeni response strike on Israel's strategic depth will be devastating, escalating, and ongoing. Wait for surprises. We will not promise threats like the clown Netanyahu promised. We will let the missiles and the various and destructive drones speak to the depth of the Zionist enemy. Then the settlers will curse Herzl, Balfour, Ben-Gurion, Britain, and everyone who brought them to Palestine.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syfjfz1p1g	2025-01-10T12:23:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/10/B1o9maAUye/B1o9maAUye_1_202_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

My contribution as Deputy Chief of Staff is limited,' Major General Amir Baram, the IDF Deputy Chief of Staff, wrote to the Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, and asked him to end his position next month after his tenure was extended by six months, totaling two and a half years overall. MG Baram, one of the most experienced officers in the IDF, served as the Northern Command Commander before being appointed Deputy Chief of Staff in October 2022, a position he held during the October 7 massacre and throughout the entire 15 months of war since then. In a letter to Chief of Staff Halevi, Major General Baram wrote: 'A few months ago, following your request and in coordination with the Defense Minister, I extended my term for another six months (until February 2025) because I believed it was appropriate and right to grant the request due to the intensified war despite the term of the Deputy Chief of Staff is for only two years.' 'On December 18, I asked your assistant to schedule a meeting on the subject of preparing for the end of my term on the agreed upon date,' he wrote in an implicit criticism of the Chief of Staff in a letter he sent to him 12 days later. 'Due to the significantly decreased intensity of the war, I feel that in the current state of affairs my contribution as Deputy Chief of Staff is limited, and because I do not intend to serve as Deputy Chief of Staff for three or four full years (a double term). Therefore, I will request to end my duties on the agreed date, February 2025, approximately two and a half years since I assumed office. Of course, in the future I will be ready to fulfill any role in the defense establishment that is required,' MG Baram added.

Engineering soldiers fight first tunnel battle ever in Lebanon	Just two kilometers from Israel's border, the Engineering Corps found an operational tunnel leading to Kiryat Shmona; IDF blows up asset after a 36-hour battle IDF releases exclusive footage from the first tunnel exchange in the history of the IDF. Operation 'Closed Circle' set out to destroy Hezbollah's huge underground terror base about two months ago in the village of Rab El Thalathine in southern Lebanon. Watch extraordinary footage from the bowels of the earth: Soldiers from the Engineering Corps fought for 36 hours against the Radwan squad that guarded Hezbollah's strategic asset, which was intended to serve as the main base for the invasion of the Upper Galilee, and to conquer Kiryat Shmona, Misgav Am, and Manara. The huge compound was dug for more than a decade, under the nose of the IDF and only about two kilometers from the border with Israel, Hezbollah prepared living quarters like those in IDF bases for more than 200 of the terror organization's elite terrorists. The compound also included dining rooms, communications control rooms, safes, food, water and generators for a protected and hidden stay of months, and especially bunkers that contained thousands of advanced weapons: ammunition for a battalion scale, RPG and long-range anti-tank missiles, IEDs of various sizes, hundreds of rifles, tactical uniforms, helmets, vests, walkie-talkies and more. Paratrooper soldiers were the first to uncover the huge base that was hidden behind a secret door on a mountainside that cannot be seen directly from Israel. 'It was a brown and protected door where we found advanced, ready-to-use Iranian-made IEDs. The door seemed suspicious to me, and saw that it was exactly like other doors in southern Lebanon that my friends had found. Behind them were terror tunnels carved into the mountain. At that moment I realized that we had found what we were looking for,' described the squadron commander, Major A. However, a deadly surprise awaited the 28-year-old officer beyond the door that no engineering soldier had ever had, armed terrorists who were well prepared to protect the strategic asset. According to Major A., 'We broke through the door, and then in front of us was a narrow, partially lit corridor tunnel, which led to another door. We moved slowly, and then I looked up and saw a security camera peephole turned in my direction, and behind it were wires connected to a large explosive device, weighing 35 kilograms. A door at the end of the tunnel A. knew that this was probably the last sight of his life, as a Hezbollah terrorist watching him through a rear camera could now activate the powerful device inside the tunnel. The 28-year-old officer from the IDF's elite unit had two options: scream at his comrades who were clinging to him to run amok back to the tunnel entrance or fire a bullet at the camera in front of him, hoping that the terrorist in front of the monitor had not yet noticed them. 'I made a split-second decision to shoot at the camera, and that was the most dangerous moment in my opinion of the operation,' the squadron commander described. He and his soldiers then broke through the door, already hearing gunshots and muffled shouts in Arabic from the inner complex beyond the entrance at the end of the tunnel, and then he made another, no less important decision. 'I peeked inside a little, hoping to see an electrical cabinet, which was indeed there. I approached with cover and fired at him so that all the lights in the large, sealed compound would go out, and then the advantage would pass from the terrorists to us.' The IDF and Hezbollah engaged in a long battle, at the end of which the terrorists managed to escape wounded and bleeding through hidden escape shafts that emerged from the west of the village, away from the IDF forces. According to intelligence, at least two of them died from their wounds. There were no casualties in the IDF, not even the special negotiating force that was rushed to the scene and tried to convince the terrorists to surrender.

The 'Houthi' connection	Houthis bother the US and Israel with missiles and attacks on the Red Sea since the outbreak of war despite the American shift to the offensive and the Israeli retaliations Since the launch of the Swords of Iron War, we have witnessed the involvement of the distant arena in Yemen, from which the Houthis fire surface-to-surface missiles and launch drones at Israel. Beyond the ballistic and aerial threat, the Houthis are also challenging shipping routes in the Red Sea. After Israel struck Hamas and Hezbollah, and in light of the developments in Syria that weaken Iran's ability to influence the region, the Houthis continue to harass the Israeli home front – in recent weeks with an increasing rate of surface-to-surface missile fire at Israel. The Houthis and their actions against Israel The Houthis are a Yemeni Shiite Muslim group that has been involved in a protracted conflict inside Yemen. Their involvement goes beyond local conflicts, and they integrate with the Iranian-led 'axis of resistance' against the United States and Israel. As part of the war, the Houthis launched several missiles and drone attacks aimed at Israel. For example, on October 19, 2023, they launched cruise missiles and drones at Israel, which were intercepted by an American warship in the Red Sea. Other attacks also included drones and ballistic missiles aimed at Israel, which indicated from the beginning of the campaign an ongoing challenge. Israel's response In the early stages of the campaign and in response to these threats, Israel focused mainly on intercepting incoming missiles and drones. For example, the Arrow system successfully intercepted a ballistic missile over the Red Sea near Eilat. Later, Israel presented the ability to launch air strikes against the Houthis' military infrastructure in Yemen, but so far it has refrained from launching a full-scale campaign, out of the need to concentrate its efforts against Hamas and Hezbollah. The continued threat from the Houthis, along with the weakening of the Shiite axis, raises a number of directions of action that are required to neutralize this arena, so far it is evident that the efforts, both by Israel and by the United States and its partners, have not succeeded in neutralizing or deterring the Houthis – we are currently witnessing the intensification of the campaign against the Houthis in Yemen under the context of freedom of navigation and the removal of the threat from Israel. U.S. responds to the Houthis The U.S. has a significant role to play in thwarting Houthi attacks, especially those that threaten maritime security in the Red Sea. U.S. forces intercepted Houthi drones and missiles, carried out airstrikes on Houthi military installations, and increased maritime patrols in the area. These actions are designed to protect international shipping lanes and support regional allies, including Israel. The U.S. has also coordinated with other countries, such as Britain and Saudi Arabia, to establish collective defense against Houthi aggression but so far this fighting has been mainly characterized by counter-fire, with no significant action that will fundamentally change the situation. Effective solutions to reduce Houthi threats Dealing with the Houthi threat in the Red Sea requires a multidimensional approach. First, improving maritime security through increased maritime patrols and international cooperation can help maintain commercial shipping. Second, diplomatic efforts to resolve the broader conflict in Yemen may reduce the Houthis' ability and motivation to carry out attacks. Third, targeted military operations may be needed to strike at the Houthis' missile and drone capabilities to reduce immediate threats. In the ballistic dimension, dealing with the missile threat specifically involves strengthening the missile defense systems in Israel and allied countries. Advanced interception technologies, such as the Arrow and Iron Dome systems, have proven to be effective, but they must be constantly upgraded to deal with evolving threats. In addition, intelligence sharing between regional and international partners can improve early warning capabilities, and enable preventive measures against imminent attacks. Ground option It is not impossible, and perhaps even more intense, that significant ground action against the Houthi threat will be required if they do not cease their activities in the naval fleet and on the air route. This type of operation is complex due to the great distance from Israel, and the possible complications – one of the examples of such operations we have seen in the past, for example, in the U.S. fight against terrorism in Somalia in the early 1990s. Evidently, the American failure affects the perception of using force even now. With an emphasis on the American reluctance to carry out ground operations against threats in distant arenas – a task that requires the use of significant force beyond the operation on the ground, including the need for rescue and general assistance – it is evident that so far efforts have been made to avoid an all-out campaign against the Houthis due to the possible consequences. In any case, in the eyes of many, this is a very secondary arena. The 'loitering' munitions The term 'loitering munition' refers to a type of weapon system that can remain in the air for an extended period of time, monitoring a target area before it attacks. These systems combine the capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and guided missiles, enabling real-time decision-making and precise hitting. In the context of Israel's strategic considerations, loitering munitions can be effectively used in operations against the Houthis in Yemen. The Houthis' use of asymmetric warfare tactics, including the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and missile systems, poses a complex threat that requires advanced countermeasures. Loitering ammunition offers several benefits, including the ability to provide continuous surveillance, engage moving targets, and minimize collateral damage through precision hits. The application of loitering munitions in the current war can improve Israel's operational flexibility and efficiency. By integrating these systems into their broader intelligence and surveillance network, Israeli forces will be able to disrupt Houthi operations and reduce their capabilities at minimal risk. This approach is consistent with modern warfare's emphasis on technological superiority and precision strikes, which is essential for dealing with emerging threats in the region. Targeted raids on the ground A targeted raid is a military operation that focuses on a specific target with precision and minimal collateral damage. This strategy often involves using intelligence to locate and neutralize high-value targets, such as key personnel, equipment, or infrastructure. Targeted raids are designed to achieve strategic targets quickly and efficiently, and are often used by special forces units due to their special training and ability to perform quick and covert operations. In the context of Israel's struggle against the Houthis in Yemen, the use of targeted raids can serve a number of strategic purposes. First, these actions can disrupt the Houthis' command and control structures by eliminating or capturing key leaders. This will reduce the group's operational effectiveness and create a leadership vacuum, which could lead to internal undermining. Second, targeted raids can be used to destroy specific assets that are essential to the Houthis' combat capabilities. This includes weapons caches, communication centers, and logistical supply lines. By focusing on these critical junctures, Israel could deteriorate the Houthis' ability to sustain protracted military confrontations, thereby weakening their overall position. Third, targeted raids can gather valuable intelligence that can be used for future operations. This may include documents, electronic devices, or prisoners that can provide insights into the Houthis' plans, tactics, and external support networks. Intelligence obtained from targeted raids can improve the effectiveness of subsequent operations and contribute to a broader understanding of the adversary. In operational terms, Israel's use of targeted raids against the Houthis will likely involve coordination with local and regional partners to secure access and minimize the risk of escalation. The success of such operations will depend on precise intelligence, careful planning, and the ability to carry out missions quickly and discreetly. The continuity factor Beyond the fact that this concept is a significant principle of warfare in defeating military threats, it has not been expressed so far when it comes to the Houthis. It is evident that the strategy adopted against the Houthi threat has been expressed in sporadic actions – so far this arena has not really experienced sustained military pressure. The Houthi threat requires Israel to take a very diverse approach and employ a number of offensive capabilities, with an emphasis on international cooperation In order to significantly neutralize this arena, continuous action is required over time, it must combine all of the capabilities mentioned above, mainly offensive, and at defined timings. The Houthis must feel a systematic attack on all of their capabilities over time and continuously, with an emphasis on a direct threat to their leaders. Here there is a great opportunity for a coalition campaign in which each country will bring its relative advantages in the battlefields. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In summary, the Houthi threat requires Israel to take a very diverse approach and employ a number of offensive capabilities, with an emphasis on international cooperation. The campaign against the Houthis is an opportunity for a local Middle Eastern coalition to present the capabilities of cooperation to eradicate terrorist militias such as the Houthis. Since this is a threat that does not concern Israel, it is desirable and correct for Israel to adopt the approach of cooperation with regional actors such as Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia – this is a test point for the seriousness of such a coalition, on which the Americans have high hopes in strategic contexts. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bynvnhaije	2025-01-10T06:35:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/21/r1ZHidyjdC/r1ZHidyjdC_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg
What's next for Hezbollah?	Dr. Jonathan Schanzer says Israel is walking into 'the great unknown' 'We are walking into the great unknown,' said Dr. Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president for research at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. Schanzer was referring to Hezbollah, which, he noted, has fewer resources than it did before the war and less cash following the collapse of the Syrian regime. However, he explained that the organization still retains a social infrastructure and light arms and is capable of 'tangling' with Lebanese armed forces. 'What will change in the long term is still unknown,' Schanzer concluded.

Can you claim Polish citizenship?	Michael Decker: Millions may be eligible without even knowing it Anyone who is a descendant of a Polish citizen may be eligible to obtain Polish citizenship. 'There may be millions of people around the world who don’t know that they could apply for Polish citizenship,' explained Michael Decker, founding partner at Decker, Pex, Levi. 'There are also probably millions around the world who won’t meet the conditions and requirements.' To obtain Polish citizenship today, applicants must prove their ancestry by providing a series of documents—many of which people often don’t have. 'We have clients in the US whose ancestors migrated through Israel before moving to the United States. We would need to prove, for example, that they didn’t serve in the Israeli IDF,' Decker said. 'Therefore, you need someone here on the ground to contact the IDF and obtain confirmation that there was no army service.' 'You don’t want to make mistakes, and you want to submit a strong application. Therefore, I think it’s definitely advisable to use a lawyer in this process,' he said, although he noted that legal representation is not mandatory. 'There is a lot of bureaucracy,' Decker added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1xlqnrlkx	2025-01-10T05:53:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/10/B1GUV2ALyx/B1GUV2ALyx_0_23_512_289_0_small.jpg

Lebanon PM vows disarmament in south as Israeli forces remain act...	Najib Mikati declares new phase of stability following election of Joseph Aoun as president; analysts suggest waning influence of Iran and allies allowed Lebanon to elect strong president who enjoys international credibility A day after Lebanon elected Joseph Aoun as president, ending a two-year political deadlock, interim Prime Minister Najib Mikati announced on Friday plans to disarm the area south of the Litani River to ensure the Lebanese army’s full control. Speaking from the presidential palace in Baabda, Mikati said, 'Lebanon is committed to disarming the southern Litani area and establishing stability in southern Lebanon and the country as a whole.' Mikati emphasized the necessity of Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon as outlined in the cease-fire agreement and discussed constitutional steps to form a new government. President Aoun, in his inaugural address, pledged to rebuild areas damaged in the fighting with Israel and to uphold the cease-fire agreement, while strengthening ties with Arab states and rebuilding relations with Syria. Analysts attribute Aoun’s election to a weakening Iranian influence in Lebanon, coupled with increased Saudi involvement. Middle East expert Lina Khatib noted this marks the first time since Lebanon's civil war that a president was elected without explicit approval from Iran or Syria. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hezbollah’s acceptance of Aoun signals a diminished ability to dictate Lebanon’s political agenda, reflecting broader geopolitical shifts. Mikati is set to visit Syria alongside Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian congratulated Aoun and framed his election as a blow to Israel, while Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander Hossein Salami touted advances in Iranian missile and drone technology. Meanwhile, reports emerged that Israeli forces remain active in strategic positions within southern Lebanon, despite ongoing troop withdrawals. The IDF continues operations in southern Lebanon, uncovering weapons caches, rocket launchers and explosives. According to the IDF, these efforts are part of maintaining security along the northern border in line with the cease-fire. However, sporadic reports of Israeli forces entering villages and clashing with Hezbollah-linked operatives have stirred tensions, with Lebanon’s military beginning to assume control in evacuated areas. Israeli officials confirm that forces will maintain a presence at three strategic points: Labbouneh Forest in the west, Jabal Balat in the central sector and Talat al-Hammamas near Metula. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryhjv50uyg	2025-01-10T03:44:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/27/Hk0MMvVXyx/Hk0MMvVXyx_459_658_2542_1431_0_small.jpg
Israeli intelligence reservists allege IDF stuck in pre-October 7...	Dozens of IDF reservists send letter to state comptroller, alleging Military Intelligence failures, silencing of dissent and lack of reforms after October 7 Dozens of active reservists from the Israeli Military Intelligence Directorate (AMAN), including officers and senior NCOs, have written to State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman, calling for a meeting to present what they describe as systemic intelligence failures during and before the war. Among the signatories are senior officers holding the rank of lieutenant colonel, who accuse the military of rigid adherence to outdated concepts that stifle dissenting viewpoints and hinder effective decision-making. The letter follows revelations of AMAN's suppression of intelligence warnings related to external actors ahead of the Hamas-led October 7 attacks. Reservists cited incidents, including a case involving a noncommissioned officer who allegedly attempted to warn of an impending assault. The officers also referenced the 'Classified Documents Affair,' in which intelligence personnel, frustrated by internal resistance, leaked sensitive findings to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's close circle in a bid to elevate their concerns. 'We’ve observed how alternative viewpoints, critical for national security, have been repeatedly silenced within the ranks,' the letter reads. The reservists demand structural reforms within AMAN to establish mechanisms for surfacing contrarian analyses and breaking entrenched doctrines. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: They specifically criticized the lack of significant institutional changes post-October 7, stating, 'Despite public discourse on the failure to issue proper warnings, no structured system has been established to ensure dissenting voices are heard.' They argue that the absence of such mechanisms led to missed opportunities to preempt or mitigate Hamas' attacks. In their letter, the reservists also called for the establishment of a critical oversight body within the IDF to facilitate open and inclusive discussions of intelligence. 'Without such reforms, national security remains vulnerable to blind spots,' they warned. Addressing the 'Classified Documents Affair,' the signatories said individuals like NCO Ari Rosenfeld, who is still detained, acted out of a sense of duty to national security. They described his treatment and those of others implicated as disproportionate to their actions. The State Comptroller’s Office confirmed receiving the letter and announced it would address the concerns in accordance with its procedures. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjefz908ke	2025-01-10T03:32:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/HybK3oo5Lkx/HybK3oo5Lkx_0_0_1601_901_0_small.jpg
Western airstrikes pound northern Yemen, reports say	Arab media reports US, UK forces carried out 12 airstrikes in Yemen’s northwestern Amran province; strikes come a day after Israel downed 3 drones believed to have been launched from Yemen Twelve airstrikes were carried out by British and American forces in Harf Sufyan, Yemen’s northwestern Amran province, the Houthi-affiliated Al-Masirah channel reported Friday afternoon. According to reports in Arab media, Western forces targeted underground facilities operated by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. Neither the U.S. nor the UK has confirmed these allegations. Meanwhile, the Israeli Air Force intercepted three drones Thursday night, all believed to have been launched from Yemen. The first drone was downed shortly after 8 p.m., following an alert in Kibbutz Gevulot in southern Israel. The two subsequent drones were intercepted without alarms being triggered. The third interception was captured on video by residents in central Israel, including the Tel Aviv area. According to the IDF, Houthi forces have launched approximately 320 drones toward Israel since the war began, with over 100 intercepted by the Israeli Air Force. Most of the drones either fell in open fields, failed to cross into Israeli airspace or caused no significant damage. Two direct impacts have been confirmed, while other incidents resulted in debris falls, including in a playground in Tel Aviv and a school in Ramat Efal. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Additionally, the IDF reported that the Houthis have launched around 40 surface-to-surface missiles toward Israel throughout the war, most of which were intercepted. 'So far, we’ve confirmed one impact in addition to partial interceptions that resulted in debris falls,' the military said. Newly released footage showcased the interception of two drones, one by a fighter jet and another by a combat helicopter. In an audio recording from December 16, Air Force personnel discussed the interception of a surface-to-surface missile launched from Yemen toward central Israel: 'We have a target on track toward Tel Aviv and the Gush Dan region,' a voice was heard saying before announcing, 'Launch, interception. We have positive kill confirmation and multiple indications of a successful hit.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjnl6fa8yg	2025-01-10T03:17:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/27/HyRW11dnByg/HyRW11dnByg_0_353_488_275_0_small.jpg

After 15 months of combat, Katz seeks IDF strategy shift to avoid...	Defense minister calls for shift in Gaza strategy, demanding IDF present plan to decisively defeat Hamas should hostages not be released by time Trump takes office; Katz dismisses discussions about post-war Gaza as long as Hamas left standing Defense Minister Israel Katz has directed the military to submit a plan for the 'complete defeat of Hamas in Gaza,' emphasizing that the plan will proceed if the terrorist group does not release the hostages by the time U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office. In a statement from Katz’s office, the defense minister underscored during a high-level security meeting that the release of hostages remains the top priority for Israel’s security establishment. The meeting included IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, Defense Ministry Director-General Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir and senior military commanders. 'We cannot allow ourselves to be drawn into a prolonged war of attrition while the hostages remain in Hamas tunnels, their lives at risk and enduring severe suffering,' Katz said. He also instructed the military to outline potential obstacles to implementing the plan, including humanitarian concerns, leaving key decisions to the political echelon. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Katz dismissed discussions of political solutions for Gaza, saying that no Arab or international actor would assume responsibility for Gaza’s civilian management without the total collapse of Hamas. 'Our commanders and soldiers are conducting a heroic fight, but we must adapt our strategy to deliver a decisive military victory and conclude the war in Gaza,' he added. The proposed 'total defeat of Hamas' would focus on dismantling the group’s remaining military units, concentrated in areas such as Nuseirat and Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, where most hostages are believed to be held. However, the IDF has refrained from large-scale operations in these areas, fearing harm to the hostages—a decision made with the approval of Israel’s political leadership. Katz warned against a prolonged war that could exact a heavy toll without achieving a strategic victory.

His head and legs were crushed': Adi injured in New Orleans atta...	Adi Levin, 23, severely injured in car-ramming and shooting attack in New Orleans during trip to unwind from military service; facing lengthy recovery, his family urges Israel to recognize him as terror victim to cover treatment and rehabilitation costs Adi Levin, one of two Israeli nationals injured in the New Year’s Eve ramming and shooting attack in New Orleans, remains bedridden in a downtown hospital due to severe head injuries. Levin experiences frequent lapses in concentration, falling into deep sleep every few minutes. However, on Thursday night, he briefly opened his eyes and surprised his father, Hagai, with a question: 'How did he do?' It took Hagai a moment to process the question, but as an avid NBA fan, he quickly realized his son was asking about the Portland Trail Blazers' game against the New Orleans Pelicans, featuring Israeli player Deni Avdija. 'New Orleans is a mediocre team, so we talked about the game and their poor performance. It was a nice morning chat, and then he drifted back into a deep sleep,' the father recounted from his son’s hospital room. Hagai offered a glimpse into Adi’s condition: 'His state fluctuates, but I’m optimistic. I’ll bring my son home. His life will change—he’ll have metal rods in his arms and legs, an open head wound and part of his skull is missing. There are still injuries we’ll fully understand only in a month when we begin the head rehabilitation process. But he’ll return to us, and for that, we’re moving our home from the Golan Heights to Tel Aviv to be closer to Tel HaShomer hospital.' In another building of the hospital complex lies Y., Adi’s travel companion and friend from their mandatory service in the IDF Armored Corps, with whom he also served in the reserves. Due to concerns over the wave of arrest threats targeting IDF soldiers worldwide and potential lone 'troublemakers' who might target Israelis, Y. has chosen to remain anonymous. Despite being bedridden, he communicates with his family and jokes with friends back in Israel. 'I miss everyone terribly and am deeply grateful to the Jewish community here for their support,' he said. Adi and Y. embarked on their 'big road trip,' as they called it, after completing two reserve duty tours in Gaza and another in Lebanon. 'They were already being told about a fourth tour, so they decided to take advantage of the time and fulfill what Adi had dreamed of doing for years,' Adi's father recounted. 'The plan was a three-month road trip by car. Adi wanted to follow in his father’s footsteps because I took the same trip when I was young. They started in Nebraska with my brother, rented a car, and drove west to Los Angeles, then to Texas, and onto New Orleans for Christmas. From there, they planned to continue to Florida.' On New Year’s Eve, they parked near their hotel and wandered into the city's main street to soak in the bustling atmosphere, parties, pubs and amateur cover bands for which New Orleans is famous. They mingled with tourists and locals, enjoying the night. But around 3 a.m., everything changed. 'A car coming from the opposite direction hit Adi head-on, crushing his legs and head, dragging him along the road, and pushing his friend to the side,' his father recounted after reviewing the security camera footage. Hours later, Y.'s parents received a phone call from the hospital: 'He was hysterical but was also worried about Adi because he didn’t know where he was.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Adi was listed as missing until local Chabad staff found him at a hospital, identifying him through his credit card details. The rabbi contacted his father, and the family rushed to take a flight spanning more than 20 hours via Europe to the U.S. Since then, they have remained by his bedside, supported by the Foreign Ministry, led by Israeli Consul General to the Southwestern United States Elad Shoshan, and the local Jewish community, which rented them an apartment near the hospital. 'Without this support, I don’t know how we would have coped with this situation,' said Hagai. 'We didn’t even know where the kids’ belongings were. Adi’s phone and passport are still missing, and the hotel initially refused to give us their things until the FBI intervened and explained who we were. 'The hospital here operates at an incredible standard. We are receiving exceptional care, but despite their travel insurance, a single day of hospitalization here costs roughly the equivalent of the entire annual budget of Israel’s healthcare system combined. The expenses will exceed a million dollars. 'Local authorities have said they will help cover some of the costs, but so far, these are just promises. We are facing a long recovery ahead. He’s spent two weeks in the emergency room and will need several months in rehabilitation with complex surgeries. We won’t return to Israel before April.' The family is now requesting that Adi and his friend be recognized as victims of a terror attack to fund their continued treatment and facilitate their return to Israel. 'The law clearly states that an Israeli injured in such an event abroad is entitled to comprehensive support, and I expect the State of Israel to take responsibility and help us get these kids back on their feet,' Adi's father said. 'They are good citizens who gave the best years of their lives to the country, went through tough experiences, and are among our finest. I don’t say this just because he’s my son. He went to the U.S. to unwind, not to take risks, not to go bungee jumping or do something reckless. I expect a call from the Foreign Ministry and the National Insurance Institute to step in and assist. 'I also served my country as a soldier. We are good, regular people without enormous financial means. And here, we are dealing with a Muslim extremist, a jihadist. It doesn’t matter whether he received direct orders from ISIS or just acted out of inspiration—he did what he did, and now we have shattered children. We want them home. The state knows how to support its people properly, especially those like these boys who gave four years of their lives. That’s my expectation. 'All our plans have changed. His older sister was supposed to get married, but now the family is planning to relocate to Tel Aviv, where there isn’t a Chabad center to help us with meals. So we are now launching a campaign to prepare for what lies ahead. We have one mission: to bring our boys home.' Consul General Shoshan said that while the conditions of the injured have improved and there is significant optimism, 'we all know the road to recovery will be slow, long and difficult.' Shoshan noted that the attack in New Orleans did not occur in isolation. 'Since October 7, we have seen anti-Jewish and anti-Israel protests across the U.S. escalate into demonstrations against America and the Western world. The rhetoric of a 'global intifada' has grown more extreme, words turned into actions and those actions evolved into acts of terror targeting innocent people—precisely like the attack in New Orleans,' he said. 'The assailant didn’t necessarily aim to harm only Israelis but attacked indiscriminately, targeting anyone in his path. The year 2025 began with a chilling reminder of the consequences of terror. This is a wake-up call for the Western world to act decisively against it. From our experience in Israel, terror doesn’t disappear—it only escalates. We must stand firm against it and fight relentlessly. There is no alternative but to completely eradicate it from our lives.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkeo5val1l	2025-01-10T00:57:13-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/10/rygGGwfRIyg/rygGGwfRIyg_0_180_598_337_0_small.jpg
Historic Jewish temple and community in ashes	Eaton fire consumes acres near Los Angeles A massive wildfire, now named the Eaton Fire, continues to blaze through parts of Pasadena and Altadena, consuming over 2,000 acres and leaving devastation in its wake. Among the most significant losses is the historic Pasadena Jewish Temple, which was reduced to ashes overnight as firefighters struggled to contain the fast-moving inferno. Unrelenting Firestorm The Eaton Fire is part of a trio of wildfires wreaking havoc across communities near Los Angeles. Despite the efforts of over 500 firefighting personnel, the fire remains uncontained, with two fatalities reported so far. 'We have over 2,000 acres burning at this time, and the fire continues to grow with 0% containment,' L.A. County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said. 'We have over 500 personnel assigned, and unfortunately, we have two reported fatalities.' A Community in Mourning For the Jewish community, the destruction of the Pasadena Jewish Temple is a heartbreaking loss. For generations, the temple served as a sanctuary, a cultural hub, and a cornerstone of Jewish life. Decades of historical records and artifacts housed in the synagogue’s archives are feared lost. Community leaders are already mobilizing plans to rebuild. Local residents are banding together, emphasizing unity and resilience in the face of this tragedy. The fire has also destroyed several Jewish-owned businesses and residences in the area, further compounding the community’s grief. Widespread Destruction Across Los Angeles The Eaton Fire is one of three wildfires devastating the region, with over 1,000 structures destroyed so far. Firefighters are stretched thin as they combat harsh weather conditions and a race against time to prevent further loss of life and property. As the flames continue to spread, the Pasadena and Altadena communities, along with their neighbors across Los Angeles, face an uphill battle to recover and rebuild.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryt2xdri1e	2025-01-10T00:29:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/09/B1MibCnnUJx/B1MibCnnUJx_0_81_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Israel rallies global support to secure release of researcher kid...	Senior official says 'changes in the region' have created opportunity to work toward Elizabeth Tsurkov's release; family of Israeli woman kidnapped in 2023 meets with foreign hostage and missing persons coordinators Israel has intensified efforts to secure the release of Elizabeth Tsurkov, a researcher kidnapped in Iraq nearly two years ago, the Washington Post reported on Thursday, citing a senior Israeli official. The renewed push involves collaboration with Israel’s allies, with the matter raised during a meeting of international hostage negotiators in Jerusalem this week. Envoys from the United States, Britain, Germany, Austria and Canada attended the meeting, which included discussions with Tsurkov’s family. According to the official, Israel has asked these nations to leverage their embassies in Baghdad to pressure the Iraqi government to initiate negotiations for her release. Without diplomatic ties to Iraq, Israel is relying on third-party nations to mediate. 'Many nations have embassies and contacts with the Iraqi government,' the official said, expressing hope for broader international support. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israel believes recent regional shifts have created an opportunity to advocate publicly for Tsurkov’s release after months of behind-the-scenes efforts. The official cited the upcoming inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on January 20 and changing dynamics in the Middle East following the Israel-Hamas war as factors that may influence Iraq’s willingness to act. Tsurkov, 36, is an Israeli-Russian dual citizen and Princeton University doctoral student. She was abducted on March 26, 2023, in Baghdad while conducting fieldwork for her academic research. It is believed she is being held by the Iran-backed militia Kataib Hezbollah, though the group has denied involvement. On Wednesday, Tsurkov’s family met with Israeli hostage negotiator Gal Hirsch and counterparts from several other nations visiting Jerusalem. The meeting aimed to coordinate efforts among international hostage negotiators and pressure the Iraqi government to locate Tsurkov. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy0ijwrl1l	2025-01-10T00:01:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/07/06/BkF00KAXKn/BkF00KAXKn_0_272_2000_1126_0_small.jpg

A synagogue in Sydney was daubed in antisemitic graffiti on Friday, police said, the latest in a spate of incidents targeting Jews in Australia. Police will deploy a special task force to investigate the attack on the Southern Sydney Synagogue in the suburb of Allawah that happened in the early hours of Friday morning, New South Wales state Police Assistant Commissioner Peter McKenna told a news conference. 'The people who do the sort of thing should realize we will be out in force to look for them, we will catch them and prosecute them,' he said.

Hamza Ziyadne confirmed dead days after his father Youssef brought to burial in Israel; 98 hostages remain in Gaza The IDF confirmed Friday that Hamza Ziyadne, 23, abducted during the October 7 Hamas attacks, was killed while held captive in Gaza. His remains were identified at the National Center of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv, days after being recovered alongside his father Youssef’s body from a tunnel near Rafah by IDF and Shin Bet forces. The announcement leaves 98 Israeli hostages still in Hamas captivity. According to military officials, the bodies were discovered in a subterranean area where several Hamas operatives were also found dead. The circumstances and timing of their deaths remain unclear, though the two were reportedly held together. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamza, his father, and two of Youssef's children—Bilal and Aisha—were kidnapped from Kibbutz Holit during the attacks. While Bilal and Aisha were released in a November prisoner exchange, the family had held onto hope that Youssef and Hamza would return alive. Youssef was laid to rest Thursday in Rahat, where thousands gathered to mourn. However, no government representatives attended the funeral. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office stated that officials from the POW and Missing Persons Division had been present, but the family's decision for an immediate burial left little time for ministerial attendance. Family members expressed frustration with the government, accusing leaders of mishandling negotiations to recover hostages alive. 'They wanted them dead,' alleged Odeh Ziyadne, a relative, suggesting officials sought to avoid potential testimony against them in future inquiries. Rahat Mayor Talel Al-Krenawi lamented the loss, calling it 'a day of sorrow and disappointment for the entire nation.' He said the family had prepared to celebrate Youssef’s anticipated return, only to receive devastating news of his death. Other relatives echoed their grief and anger, criticizing the government for failing to secure the hostages’ safe release. 'We’ve lived more than 450 days without peace,' said Kamel Ziyadne. 'Better negotiations might have brought them home alive.' The IDF and Shin Bet reiterated their commitment to bringing all hostages back, stating they are 'using every effort to secure the swift return of those still held captive.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rytdtsalyx	2025-01-09T22:41:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/03/12/rkmvEOTa6/rkmvEOTa6_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Israel plans to set zone of control in Syria amid new regime worr...	Senior officials say they're shocked to see the West welcome Syria's de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa with open arms considering his previous terror ties; plans include keeping IDF forces in Syria Senior officials in Israel said on Thursday that the country would need to maintain a 15 km (9.3 mi) operational perimeter within Syrian territory, where the IDF would maintain a presence to ensure that allies of the new regime couldn’t launch missiles toward the Golan Heights. They also noted the necessity of a 'sphere of influence' extending 60 km (37 mi) into Syria, under Israeli intelligence control, to monitor and prevent potential threats from developing. Israeli officials were reportedly astounded by what they described as the West's 'blindness' toward the regime of Ahmad al-Sharaa, (formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani), the new leader of the jihadist rebels. Al-Sharaa, who was formerly associated with al-Qaida, had since distanced himself from the terrorist organization and claimed to have moderated his stance. 'The U.S., UK and Germany are flocking to the butcher al-Sharaa,' an Israeli official said. These remarks came as senior Western representatives traveled to Damascus, hoping that al-Sharaa’s claims of moderation and plans for a governance structure respecting human rights would materialize. There was even speculation that Syria under his leadership might eventually move toward democracy, though al-Sharaa himself said that elections were unlikely for the foreseeable future. The U.S. had already removed a $10 million bounty placed on his head a decade earlier and recently eased some sanctions on Syria. A senior Israeli official alleged that the West was deliberately 'choosing to be blind,' dealing with 'some of the most dangerous people in the world ' – former al-Qaida members. 'It’s incredible how the world has fallen into this trap again. 'The Arab world surrounding us understands the threat and is warning the West but they refuse to listen. While [Bashar] Assad’s fall and the weakening of Iran’s axis in Syria are undoubtedly positive developments, new threats are emerging.' The official added that, while the Syrian rebels had sent messages to Israel claiming they weren’t seeking conflict, he remained skeptical. 'This might hold true for a year, two years, maybe even 10 or 20. 'But no one can guarantee that eventually, they won’t turn against us – and these are highly dangerous people. Al-Sharaa’s current goal is to lift sanctions on Syria to bring in foreign funds. But in the long run, Israel must maintain a control zone and a sphere of influence in Syria.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He also expressed hope that Israel would receive full backing against threats from Syria and Lebanon after the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on January 20. 'In the meantime, we’ll have to remain there, ensuring a 15-km missile-free zone under our control, as well as a 60-km sphere of influence, to prevent threats from developing. We’re building an operational concept for this new reality.' Israel was also concerned about the potential entrenchment of Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Syria, seemingly ignored by al-Sharaa. 'We won’t allow their establishment in Syria just as we prevented Iran’s foothold there,' the official said. 'We estimate that al-Sharaa prefers to keep them there so they can act against Israel, giving him plausible deniability.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1frlaaukg	2025-01-09T13:50:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/22/BJmudgIS1x/BJmudgIS1x_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

My family has received so many death threats': Influencer Lizzy ...	Celebrated lifestyle influencer and Israel advocate tells Ynetnews in exclusive interview about her decision to shift gears after facing the October 7 attack and use her platform to tell Israel's true story, despite the consequences; 'I couldn't stay silent' For years, Lizzy Savetsky was celebrated as a lifestyle influencer, inspiring her followers with her unique blend of fashion, family and faith. However, the events of October 7 marked a turning point as Lizzy transformed her platform into a powerful voice for Israel and her Jewish heritage. Now in Israel to receive a presidential award for her extraordinary efforts, Lizzy reflects on the emotional journey that reshaped her life and the challenges she bravely faced along the way. Lizzy, being in Israel with your family on October 7 must have deeply impacted you. How did that influence your decision to advocate so much for Israel? 'I had started advocating for Israel on my platform a couple of years before October 7. During the conflict in Gaza in 2021, when Hamas sent a barrage of rockets to Israel, I was shocked to see how immediately upon Israel's response, so many of my peers on social media in the fashion space and the lifestyle space who had never been to Israel, had never been to the Middle East, who knew nothing, jumped to demonize Israel.' 'I just felt like there was this void, I didn't see anyone in my position speaking up to defend Israel. And so, I made a decision one specific day in May of 2021 to commit my platform to defending the truth for Israel. 'And there was really no turning back after that because I suffered a lot of consequences, and it became clear to me that I either had to pretend like that never happened, or I was going to have to just completely pivot and shift my focus completely to Israel and the Jewish people.' 'So being here in Israel on October 7, as I was sitting in the bomb shelter with my family, I looked at my husband and I said, said, ‘We know exactly what is going to happen.’ The minute that Israel responds, and it was actually even before Israel responded, the world will demonize Israel and then Jews all over the world are going to suffer a wave of antisemitism like we've never seen before.' 'And I knew from that moment in the bomb shelter that I was going to be very busy, that I had a lot of work ahead of me.' 'When I first made the big shift, I lost a ton of followers' How has your relationship with your audience evolved since you began openly advocating for Israel? Have you encountered support or backlash you didn't anticipate? 'In 2021, when I first made the big shift, I lost a ton of followers. I think it was like 30,000. I got dropped by my management company at the time. Not because they were antisemitic or anti-Israel, it was because I was no longer marketable. They couldn't sell me to any brands because I was too controversial because I was speaking up on behalf of the Jewish people and the Jewish nation. 'But thankfully, I had that big purge two and a half years before October 7. So, by the time October 8 rolled around, people knew this is what Lizzy does. She speaks up for the Jewish people. She's going to be telling us what's the latest that's happening in Israel. She's there now. 'And so I was actually seeing a flood of followers come in following October 7. Although it was hard in the beginning and there was a bit of an identity crisis, there is no better feeling than walking in your truth and standing firmly in your values. And if you lose something for doing that, then was it ever even really worth having?' You fight consistently against antisemitism and even have been lecturing extensively over the past year about it. Have you personally faced an incident driven by antisemitic motives? 'It's so interesting because when I started advocating against antisemitism, I had only experienced minor implicit forms of it. I didn't have that personal experience. My husband now, he's a plastic surgeon in New York and he takes care for free of anyone who is a victim of an antisemitic violent attack. Unfortunately, he's been very busy because there have been so many. 'But in the past year, my family has received so many death threats. We have our own file with the FBI. We have had the police at our apartment more than we've had our friends over. We have been consistently targeted because of the work that I do. 'We get letters in the mail with threats. My husband was getting to his office over 1,000 phone calls with the most vicious messages that you've ever heard and I just can't believe that this level of evil exists in the world and that it is targeting me and my family simply for existing as a Jewish person.' 'It just felt like an urgent obligation' And you're in Israel receiving an award from the Israeli government. It's such a significant honor. What does that mean for you as a personal and a public figure? 'It's surreal, honestly, because I never in a million years thought that my life would go in this direction. This was not the life plan. I did not go to school to study how to be an advocate for Israel. 'But it just felt like an urgent obligation, a responsibility that I have. And the award was actually called the ‘Voice of Iron.’ And I have said repeatedly throughout this past year that my only weapon in this vicious war of propaganda is my voice. 'And I feel so grateful that I have an audience that listens to me, that amplifies my voice. But that's all I have. So, it's never been a question for me whether I would speak up or not, I just always felt like a sacred responsibility that I have to my ancestors, who could only dream of walking in the land of Israel. 'And now we get to have this sacred place. And also to my children that will inherit this land and will, God willing, carry the torch that I'm trying to use to light the way. It's been a very surreal feeling. I would speak up no matter the recognition but I'm truly humbled by the award.' What were some of the most unexpected challenges you experienced on your platform due to the events of October 7? 'I think, in a way, it felt like the Wild West. None of us had a manual for how to advocate on social media. We've all sort of been making it up as we've gone. When I started my Instagram platform, I was talking about accessories, earrings and shoes, whatever was in style. I never thought that that would be the vehicle to spread the truth for Israel. 'So I've definitely learned a lot over the past few years with what works and what doesn't. I think that the hardest challenge is not reacting to the hate because it's our human instinct whenever we see this vitriol thrown our way to react, to respond. 'And I've learned, especially this past year, that it's just I only have so much time and energy, and I would much rather use it to empower my own people than to fight these people who are going to hate me no matter what because they don't care about the truth. I think that's been the hardest challenge is kind of just keeping my own gut instinct in check.' 'My family is behind me 100%' How do your family and your close friends react to your activism? 'Thank God my family is behind me 100%. We're really a family of activists. We were all here on October 7 in the bomb shelter. I did not know how to parent through that and I'm not just an activist, I'm a mom and I think about my children and their future as Jews in America with antisemitism reaching record heights and if there's going to be a place for them. 'I didn't know how to help them really process the trauma that they experienced here in Israel and the things that they were hearing about. My 11-year-old daughter came to me and said ‘Mommy, what is rape?’ To have to have these conversations, nothing can prepare you for it. 'I was very naive. I always thought that Israel was just the strongest country in the world, and it is, but I never understood the real vulnerability and it was shocking for everyone. The only thing that I knew how to do as a mom was to put my kids to work and make them feel like they're a part of the solution and so we've really been a family of advocates. 'I wouldn't be able to do it without them. My husband is my researcher, he's reading everything, we have a meeting every morning at 6 a.m. where we talk about what video I’m going to make that day and thank God they've been so supportive. 'We try to shield the children as much as possible from all of the hate in the world, but the reality is we live in New York City and we see these protesters in the streets almost every day waving the flags of Jihad and I want them to be so deeply rooted in who they are as Jews, that they feel proud in the face of all of that hate. 'I think it is comforting to them to know that their mom is devoting her entire life to fighting on behalf of our people. ' 'I couldn't stay silent' In the recent U.S. elections, you chose to openly share your political views with your followers. What motivated you to take that step? 'I never thought that I would be talking about politics, especially in such a controversial, heated time on my Instagram platform. I had never discussed anything political before. But, I had just had it. I was so tired of seeing these protesters take over our campuses, take over the streets of my city, my children clinging to me every time we walk out of our apartment because they're scared and seeing nothing done about it. 'In fact, hearing both our president and our vice president sympathize with the protesters, say that they have a point, say that they're expressing exactly what the human emotion should be, that's what Kamala Harris said. I couldn't stay silent. 'For me, it was never about endorsing a person, it was about endorsing the policies. And nobody can deny the good work that President [Donald] Trump did for the state of Israel when he was president in his first term: moving the embassy to Jerusalem, acknowledging Jerusalem as Israel's eternal capital and the Golan Heights. 'All of these things that American presidents said they would do and didn't and he got the job done. So, as much as he can be crass and bombastic, he gets the job done, he takes action and that for me felt like an urgent thing to use my voice to promote. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I also wanted to destigmatize voting for Donald Trump because there was so much stigma around that and people getting ‘canceled’ for being associated. I wanted to say ‘Hey guys, I may not love everything about this man but I'm going to vote for him and here's why and it's okay if you want to do the same.' You spent a significant amount of time here in Israel even on October 7 and you've shared that, despite the trauma, you sometimes feel safer here than elsewhere. Have you considered making aliyah? 'I think about it every day all the time and I hope that my story ends here at home in Israel. This is the only place that I want to be. Right now I have an important job to do back home in America for the Jews there but there's no place in the world that's better, where my soul feels at home. Israel is the only place. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rktdm00plke	2025-01-09T12:58:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/09/HJRArOa8kg/HJRArOa8kg_126_30_891_501_0_small.jpg

US House votes to sanction International Criminal Court over Neta...	Some 45 Democrats joined in backing the bill and no Republicans voted against it; Now it moves to the Senate; Trump plans to sign the legislation shortly after taking office The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Thursday to sanction the International Criminal Court to protest its issuing arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister over Israel's campaign in Gaza. The vote was 243 to 140 in favor of the 'Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act,' which would sanction any foreigner who investigates, arrests, detains or prosecutes U.S. citizens or those of an allied country, including Israel, who are not members of the court. Forty-five Democrats joined 198 Republicans in backing the bill. No Republican voted against it. 'America is passing this law because a kangaroo court is seeking to arrest the prime minister of our great ally, Israel,' Representative Brian Mast, Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a House speech before the vote. The House vote, one of the first since the new Congress was seated last week, underscored strong support among President-elect Donald Trump's fellow Republicans for Israel's government, now that they control both chambers in Congress. Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20 for a second term as president. The Senate's newly appointed Republican majority leader, John Thune, has promised swift consideration of the act in his chamber so Trump can sign it into law shortly after taking office. Even though the Senate has a Republican majority of 53 in the Senate it is not certain that the bill will pass. Passage in the Senate requires at least 60 votes, meaning the votes of seven Democratic senators are needed. The bill lays out the sanctions that will be levied against anyone directly and indirectly involved, the judges, the prosecutor, in arrest warrants that call for the arrest of a 'protected person' - elected officials or the security forces of the U.S. or allied countries. Anyone who calls for the arrest of a protected person will be subject to US sanctions such as denial of a future visa and cancellation of an existing visa and ownership of assets. The ICC is a permanent court that can prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression in member states or by their nationals. The court has said its decision to pursue warrants against the Israeli officials was in line with its approach in all cases, based on an assessment by the prosecutor that there was enough evidence to proceed, and the view that seeking arrest warrants immediately could prevent ongoing crimes.

Complaint filed in Sweden as attempts to persecute IDF soldiers a...	The Hind Rajab Foundation announced that it had filed a complaint in Sweden against a Nahal Brigade IDF soldier visiting the country for 'war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide' After an IDF solder escaped from Brazil and after complaints were filed against soldiers in Thailand and Chile and other countries, the global hunt by the Hind Rajab Foundation for IDF soldiers who served in Gaza continues - and is also reaching Europe. The anti-Israel organization announced Thursday that it has filed a complaint in Sweden against an IDF soldier for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in Gaza. According to the Hind Rajab Foundation, that soldier - a Nahal Brigade fighter - is currently visiting Sweden. 'He may leave the country soon, we demand his immediate arrest,' the group wrote. The foundation attached evidence to the complaint, including a photo of him on March 1 using his sniper rifle in Gaza. 'According to eyewitnesses and journalists, civilians – including women and children – were killed in such actions,' according tot he complaint, which alleges that the unit he served in was involved in vandalism of Palestinian homes, including graffiti on the walls, and that the unit was involved in a raid on the Shifa Hospital in Gaza. On Wednesday night, in an unusual decision and against the backdrop of the same attempts by anti-Israel activists to persecute soldiers around the world, the IDF decided to hide the identities of all fighters and officers who participate in operational activities related to combat. The dramatic directive applies, from now on, to all soldiers from the rank of brigadier general and below. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Even before the latest lawsuits by the anti-Israel foundation, which files complaints based on videos and photographs posted by soldiers on social media, Ynet reported about a month ago on the growing concern in the army about attempts to persecute soldiers around the world. The IDF estimated that the decision by the International Criminal Court in The Hague to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Galant would provide a boost to arrests and other criminal proceedings around the world, including against senior army officers, and even against regular and reserve soldiers who fought in the Gaza Strip. Some were required to immediately leave the countries they visited, for fear of legal action against them. Others who planned to go abroad were warned in advance for fear of being arrested or questioned. The IDF does not prohibit regular and permanent soldiers and officers from going abroad, but does formulate a 'risk assessment' for each soldier who submits the application form to leave the country, with an emphasis on fighters and commanders who operated in Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkz1rjaikl	2025-01-09T11:28:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/09/ryVyoia8Jg/ryVyoia8Jg_0_0_2048_1152_0_small.jpg

US frustrated over lack of progress in hostage deal talks	Sources say negotiations are ongoing despite difficulties while Hamas claims Israel added new conditions demanding military presence within Gaza; Mossad chief David Barnea’s planned trip to Doha has been delayed; Trump's envoy expected to join talks Negotiations for a hostage deal in Qatar are ongoing, but no breakthrough has been achieved despite the imminent inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. As a result, Mossad chief David Barnea’s planned trip to Doha, originally scheduled for earlier this week, has been delayed and CIA director William Burns has yet to convene a summit for the talks. Sources familiar with the details believe the negotiations are not at an impasse despite the challenges. They noted that talks are progressing, but every resolved issue leads Hamas to reopen previously agreed matters. Additionally, communication difficulties between Hamas’ external leadership and its de facto leader in Gaza Mohammed Sinwar are reportedly complicating the process. Hamas has so far refused to provide a list of live hostages and mediators are working to bridge this gap. Israel continues to insist that no progress can be made without such a list. Moreover, Hamas' refusal to disclose in advance who among the hostages on the list provided by Israel to mediators in July is alive or dead is seen by officials as a tactic to maximize Palestinian prisoner releases in exchange for as few live hostages as possible. Above all, the ongoing dispute over ending the war and withdrawing IDF forces looms large. While Hamas has reportedly signaled to mediators that it is no longer insisting on this demand, the issue resurfaces repeatedly. Conversely, a senior Palestinian official told Reuters that Israel has introduced a new condition, insisting on maintaining a one-kilometer-wide military presence in the eastern and southern parts of Gaza, along the Philadelphi Corridor. 'This will hinder residents from returning to their homes and constitutes a backtrack on previously agreed terms,' the official claimed. Meanwhile, as U.S. President Joe Biden's envoys express frustration over their lack of progress, attention turns to Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, who is set to arrive in Doha tomorrow.

Hundreds of drones fired from Yemen at Israel have been thwarted ...	40 missiles, 320 drones: The IDF published data on Houthi launches since the beginning of the war; All but one of the missiles and more than 100 of the drones were intercepted The IDF has released data on missile and drone launches from Yemen since the beginning of the war, along with new recordings of interceptions. According to the IDF, since the beginning of the war the Houthis have launched about 40 surface-to-surface missiles, most of which were intercepted. 'The IDF Aerial Defense Array intercepted most of the missiles that approached Israeli territory. So far, one fallen projectile has been identified, along with two partial interceptions that led to fragments falling in the area. The rest of the launches failed en route,' the IDF reported. In two of the cases, the missiles or large fragments hit in Jaffa and and hit the Ramat Ef’al elementary school in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv.. Additionally, the Houthi terrorist regime has launched approximately 320 UAV toward Israel, over 100 of which were intercepted by the Israeli Air Force, according to he IDF. To date, two effective hits have been identified. The remaining UAVs either fell in open areas, failed to reach Israeli territory, or caused no significant damage. Video documentation provided by the IDF show the interception of two drones - one by a fighter jet and the other by a combat helicopter. In addition, communications among troops were released from the interception of a surface-to-surface missile launched from Yemen on December 1. 'Currently we see a target with a single trajectory toward Tel Aviv, the Gush Dan area,' is heard over the radio, and then an announcement: 'We have the capability...

Singapore arrests 3 locals planning to join Hamas and Iran agains...	Local authorities reveal the men were arrested since the start of the war in Gaza after Hamas' deadly attack on October 7, 2023; Suspects reportedly looked for ways to acquire military training Authorities in Singapore announced on Thursday that three local men had prepared to travel to the Middle East to fight against Israel since the war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023. One of the three, who was arrested by local police, expressed willingness to carry out attacks in Singapore if ordered to do so. Singapore's Home Affairs Ministry said in a statement that the three men had no connection between them and were reportedly radicalized online. However, it remains unclear why the arrests were disclosed only at this time. The three were detained under Singapore’s Internal Security Act, which allows for extended detention without trial. One of the suspects is Muhammad Indra Akmal Afandi, 21, an elevator mechanic. Afandi searched online for places to train with firearms and declared readiness to follow 'any order' from Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, including committing attacks in Singapore, though he had no specific plans. Another suspect, Muhammad Latiff Rahim, 41, a manager at a digital marketing firm and a fervent supporter of Iran, visited a shooting range in Bangkok in September 2022 to gain familiarity with firearms. The third suspect, Nurisham Yusuf, 44, a security guard, believed it was his 'religious duty' to travel to Gaza and fight alongside Hamas' military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades. He searched for ways to enter the Gaza Strip and posted on social media about the Israel-Hamas war, hoping someone would assist him in reaching the Strip.

Iran holds unusual military drills as it awaits return of Trump	The two-month-long military drill includes testing air defenses near a key nuclear facility and exercises in waterways vital to the global oil trade; Iran appears concerned about Trump's policy of 'maximum pressure' Iran is reeling from a cratering economy and stinging military setbacks across its sphere of influence in the Middle East. Its bad times are likely to get worse once President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House with his policy of 'maximum pressure' on Iran. Facing difficulties at home and abroad, Iran last week began an unusual two-month-long military drill. It includes testing air defenses near a key nuclear facility and preparing for exercises in waterways vital to the global oil trade. The military flexing seems aimed at projecting strength, but doubts about its power are high after the past year’s setbacks. The December overthrow of Syrian President Bashar Assad, who Iran supported for years with money and troops, was a major blow to its self-described 'Axis of Resistance' across the region. The 'axis' had already been hollowed out by Israel’s punishing offensives last year against two militant groups backed by Iran – Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel also attacked Iran directly on two occasions. An Iranian Revolutionary Guard general based in Syria offered a blunt assessment this week. 'I do not see it as a matter of pride that we lost Syria,' Gen. Behrouz Esbati said, according to an audio recording of a speech he gave that was leaked to the media. 'We lost. We badly lost. We blew it.' The U.S. and its allies have maintained stiff sanctions to deter it from developing nuclear weapons — and Iran’s recent efforts to get them lifted through diplomacy have fallen flat. Pollution chokes the skies in the capital, Tehran, as power plants burn dirty fuel in their struggle to avoid outages during winter. And families are struggling to make ends meet as the Iranian currency, the rial, falls to record lows against the U.S. dollar. As these burdens rise, so does the likelihood of political protests, which have ignited nationwide in recent years over women’s rights and the weak economy. How Trump chooses to engage with Iran remains to be seen. But on Tuesday he left open the possibility of the U.S. conducting preemptive airstrikes on nuclear sites where Iran is closer than ever to enriching uranium to weapons-grade levels. 'It’s a military strategy,' Trump told journalists at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida during a wide-ranging news conference. 'I’m not answering questions on military strategy.' Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, yet officials there increasingly suggest Tehran could pursue an atomic bomb. Europe’s view of Iran hardens It’s not just Trump or Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a longtime foe of Tehran, that paint Iran’s nuclear program as a major threat. French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking Monday to French ambassadors in Paris, described Iran as 'the main strategic and security challenge for France, the Europeans, the entire region and well beyond.' 'The acceleration of its nuclear program is bringing us very close to the breaking point,' Macron said. 'Its ballistic program threatens European soil and our interests.' While Europe had previously been seen as more conciliatory toward Iran, its attitude has hardened. That’s likely because of what Macron described as Tehran’s 'assertive and fully identified military support' of Russia since it’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. France, as well as Germany and the United Kingdom, had been part of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Under that deal, Iran limited its enrichment of uranium and drastically reduced its stockpile in exchange for the lifting of crushing, United Nations-backed economic sanctions. Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord in 2018, and with those U.N. sanctions lifted, it provided cover for China’s to purchase oil from Iran. Iran is trying to show itself as capable of defending against any possible attack But now France, Germany and the United Kingdom call Tehran’s advances in its atomic program a 'nuclear escalation' that needs to be addressed. That raises the possibility of Western nations pushing for what’s called a 'snapback' of those U.N. sanctions on Iran, which could be catastrophic for the Iranian economy. That 'snapback' power expires in October. On Wednesday, Iran released a visiting Italian journalist, Cecilia Sala, after detaining her for three weeks — even though she had received the government’s approval to report from there. Sala’s arrest came days after Italian authorities arrested an Iranian engineer accused by the U.S. of supplying drone technology used in a January 2024 attack on a U.S. outpost in Jordan that killed three American troops. The engineer remains in Italian custody. Iran holds military drills as worries grow The length of the military drills started by Iran’s armed forces and its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard may be unusual, but their intended message to the U.S. and Israel — and to its domestic audience — is not. Iran is trying to show itself as capable of defending against any possible attack. On Tuesday, Iran held air-defense drills around its underground nuclear enrichment facility in the city of Natanz. It claimed it could intercept a so-called 'bunker buster' bomb designed to destroy such sites. However, the drill did not involve any of its four advanced S-300 Russian air defense systems, which Israel targeted in its strikes on Iran. At least two are believed to have been damaged, and Israeli officials claim all have been taken out. 'Some of the U.S. and Israeli reservations about using force to address Iran’s nuclear program have dissipated,' wrote Kenneth Katzman, a longtime Iran analyst for the U.S. government who is now at the New York-based Soufan Center. 'It appears likely that, at the very least, the Trump administration would not assertively dissuade Israel from striking Iranian facilities, even if the United States might decline to join the assault.' There are other ways Iran could respond. This weekend, naval forces plan exercises in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. Iran for years has threatened to close the strait — a narrow lane through which a fifth of global oil supplies are transported — and it has targeted oil tankers and other ships in those waters since 2019. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Harassment and seizures are likely to remain the main tools of Iranian counteraction,' the private maritime security firm Ambrey warned Thursday. Its allies may not be much help, though. The tempo of attacks on shipping lanes by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, long armed by Iran, have slowed. And Iran has growing reservations about the reliability of Russia. In the recording of the speech by the Iranian general, Esbati, he alleges that Russia 'turned off all radars' in Syria to allow an Israeli airstrike that hit a Guard intelligence center. Esbati also said Iranian missiles 'don’t have so much of an impact' and that the U.S. would retaliate against any attack targeting its bases in the region. 'For the time being and in this situation, dragging the region into a military operation does not agree (with the) interest of the resistance,' he says. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1cduv68yx	2025-01-09T06:24:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/04/22/BJESZZmb0/BJESZZmb0_0_210_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House on Jan. 20 has sparked hope of a diplomatic resolution to end Moscow's invasion but also fears in Kyiv that a quick peace could come at a high price. Advisers to Trump have floated proposals to end the Ukraine war that would effectively cede large parts of the country to Russia for the foreseeable future. Biden aides say they want to put Ukraine in the strongest position on the battlefield to give them leverage for possible negotiations with Russia this year.

Lebanon's parliament chooses army commander Aoun as president, en...	After 12 failed attempts, presidential vacuum filled in first since October 2022; FM Sa'ar expresses hope for 'good neighborly relations' between Israel and Lebanon Lebanon's parliament voted Thursday to elect the country's army commander, Joseph Aoun, as head of state, filling a more than two-year-long presidential vacuum. The session was the legislature's 13th attempt to elect a successor to former President Michel Aoun — no relation to the army commander — whose term ended in October 2022. The vote came weeks after a tenuous cease-fire agreement halted a 14-month conflict between Israel and the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah and at a time when Lebanon's leaders are seeking international assistance for reconstruction. Aoun was widely seen as the preferred candidate of the United States and Saudi Arabia, whose assistance Lebanon will need to ensure that Israel withdraws its forces from southern Lebanon as stipulated in the agreement and to fund the post-war rebuilding. Aoun secured the post with the second round of voting on the day. A first round of voting showed Aoun as the frontrunner, receiving 71 out of 128 votes but falling short of the two-thirds majority needed to win outright. Of the rest, 37 lawmakers cast blank ballots and 14 voted for 'sovereignty and the constitution.' Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri adjourned the session for two hours, after which legislators returned for another round of voting. Israel conveyed a message to political circles in Beirut indicating it would 'support' Aoun's candidacy for the presidency, signaling the potential for security cooperation. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said at noon: 'I congratulate Lebanon on the election of its new president after a prolonged political crisis. I hope this choice will contribute to strengthening stability, a better future for Lebanon and its residents, and fostering good neighborly relations.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hezbollah — which has been weakened politically and militarily by the war with Israel — previously backed another candidate, Suleiman Frangieh, the leader of a small Christian party in northern Lebanon with close ties to former Syrian President Bashar Assad. However, on Wednesday, Frangieh announced he had withdrawn from the race and endorsed Aoun, clearing the way for the army chief. Also Wednesday, the Lebanese Forces, which leads the main parliamentary bloc opposed to Hezbollah, endorsed Aoun. Lebanon's fractious sectarian power-sharing system is prone to deadlock, both for political and procedural reasons. The small, crisis-battered Mediterranean country has been through several extended presidential vacancies, with the longest lasting nearly 2 1/2 years between May 2014 and October 2016. It ended when former President Michel Aoun was elected. The president's role in Lebanon is limited under the power-sharing system in which the president is always a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament Shiite. However, only the president has the power to appoint or remove a prime minister and cabinet. The caretaker government that has run Lebanon for the last two years has reduced powers because it was not appointed by a sitting president. Joseph Aoun has become the fifth former army commander to ascend to Lebanon's presidency, despite the fact that the country's constitution prohibits high-ranking public servants, including army commanders, from assuming the presidency during their term or within two years of stepping down. Although the ban has been waived before, it means that Aoun faces additional procedural hurdles. Under normal circumstances, a presidential candidate in Lebanon can be elected by a two-thirds majority of the 128-member house in the first round of voting, or by a simple majority in a subsequent round. Besides Aoun, other contenders included Jihad Azour, a former finance minister who is now the director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department at the International Monetary Fund; and Elias al-Baysari, the acting head of Lebanon's General Security agency. Al-Baisary announced Thursday that he was pulling out of the race. The next government will face daunting challenges apart from implementing the cease-fire agreement that ended the Israel-Hezbollah war and seeking funds for reconstruction. Lebanon is six years into an economic and financial crisis that decimated the country's currency and wiped out the savings of many Lebanese. The cash-strapped state electricity company provides only a few hours of power a day. The country's leaders reached a preliminary agreement with the IMF for a bail-out package in 2022 but have made limited progress on reforms required to clinch the deal. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bketortlye	2025-01-09T04:13:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/27/B1pJznNQyl/B1pJznNQyl_0_88_2362_1330_0_small.jpg

Israeli residents in affected areas evacuate as flames near, leaving lives behind; some blame California Governor Gavin Newsom for devastation, calling his inaction on dry vegetation 'criminal negligence,' echoing Donald Trump’s past warnings The largest and most destructive fires in Los Angeles' history continue to wreak havoc and spread to new neighborhoods. Over 130,000 people have been evacuated from their homes, leaving behind all their belongings with no certainty of having a home to return to. Among the evacuees are dozens of Israelis living in Pacific Palisades, Altadena, Pasadena and Hollywood Hills. Dorit Rotenberg, 66, has lived in Pacific Palisades for more than 20 years. On Tuesday morning, she left her home with her husband, dog and cat. 'We weren’t prepared to leave on such short notice, so I grabbed a few clothes shoes, and important documents, and we left. Friends of ours in the neighborhood didn’t want to leave because they hoped to save their house, but they were eventually forced to evacuate by the firefighters. That’s when we learned from them that our house had burned down,' she said. Rotenberg and her husband are now staying with friends in Thousand Oaks. 'It’s hard for me to process that we no longer have a home. Our insurance doesn’t cover fires—it’s a special insurance you need to purchase, similar to earthquake insurance, which we also don’t have. I have no idea what we’re going to do. It’s an enormous heartbreak. We left our entire lives behind in that house, and at our age, it’s not easy to start over,' she said. The Chabad rabbi of Pacific Palisades, Zushe Cunin, reported that many members of his congregation lost their homes in the fires. 'All day Tuesday and throughout the night, I tried to contact 250 community members, but I didn’t hear back from them,' he said. According to the rabbi, some refused to evacuate in a desperate attempt to save their homes from the advancing flames. While the synagogue was spared, the storage facility was destroyed, along with 16 menorahs and cars used to transport children and seniors to and from the Chabad center. Noa Goldberg, who lives in the Highlands neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, managed to leave her home only at 3 p.m., when the flames were already dangerously close. 'I tried to leave earlier, but it was impossible. Cars were gridlocked and couldn’t move anywhere,' she explained. 'I was panicking. My husband was out of town, so I was alone and didn’t know what to do. I waited until firefighters cleared the stuck vehicles so I could get out. As I drove away, I saw homes burning on every side. All the neighborhood’s beloved restaurants, the grocery store, the supermarket—every business was gone. Complete devastation. I felt like I was in hell.' Goldberg has temporarily moved in with her daughter in West Hollywood, but even there, she feels unsafe. 'The fires have reached Hollywood Hills, and I’m afraid they’ll keep spreading. We might have to evacuate from here too,' she said. The neighborhoods of Pacific Palisades, nearby Malibu, Altadena and Hollywood Hills—where the fires are most severe—are known for their luxury homes. Many celebrities have been forced to evacuate and have reported losing their homes. 'One day you’re swimming in the pool and the next day it’s all gone,' Emmy and Golden Globe winner James Woods told CNN tearfully. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Actor Billy Crystal issued a statement saying he and his wife are heartbroken after losing their home, where they had lived since 1979. 'We raised our children and grandchildren here. Every inch of our house was filled with love. Beautiful memories that can't be taken away,' said the Jewish actor. Paris Hilton also lost her home. In a post on Instagram, she wrote, 'Sitting with my family, watching the news, and seeing our home in Malibu burn to the ground on live TV is something no one should ever have to experience.' Other celebrities who evacuated their Pacific Palisades homes include Jennifer Aniston, Bradley Cooper, Adam Brody, Tom Hanks, Reese Witherspoon, Adam Sandler and Michael Keaton. Anger at officials and Trump’s warning Fierce winds reaching speeds of over 60 mph fueled devastating wildfires across Los Angeles, stretching from one end of the city to Pasadena, an hour's drive away. The city’s historic synagogue, which had served the community for over 100 years, was also devastated in the fire, including a kindergarten building that was completely consumed by flames. 'Our center is gone,' said CEO Melissa Levy in a phone interview. 'But right now, we’re more focused on our members, many of whom lost their homes or are terrified their houses will burn. We’ll think about rebuilding later.' In a message sent to congregants on Wednesday morning, synagogue leadership assured members that the Torah scrolls had been safely removed and stored at a community member's home. By Wednesday evening, the fires had reached Hollywood Hills, threatening iconic landmarks such as the Hollywood Bowl, the Walk of Fame, El Capitan Theatre, Madame Tussauds Museum and the historic Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Former Miss Israel Ilana Shoshan evacuated her home as flames spread across the hill on the opposite side of Laurel Canyon. Leah Aaron, another local resident, fled with her husband and two children to Santa Barbara, two hours north of Los Angeles. 'Just yesterday, I felt sorry for those living in Pacific Palisades, and today I find myself in this surreal situation,' she said. 'I can’t stop watching TV and crying. I’m terrified our house will burn, even though the fires haven’t reached our street yet. We were evacuated due to poor air quality and the risk of the fires spreading.' Leah and her family are staying at a hotel, hoping to return home soon. 'We bought our house just two years ago, renovated it, and invested so much in it. This feels like a nightmare I can’t wake up from,' she said. Many respondents expressed anger at Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who defunded the fire brigade after taking office in December 2022. 'I admire and respect our firefighters—they work so hard—but they don’t have enough manpower,' said Leah. 'They also didn’t have enough water and had to bring water from the ocean to fight the fires.' Goldberg criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom for failing to address the issue of forest management and clearing dry vegetation. 'Donald Trump warned him to deal with the dry brush that’s a ticking time bomb, but he chose to ignore it,' she said. 'We barely get any rain here, so everything is extremely dry. Just one spark, and it all goes up in flames. Newsom’s negligence is criminal.' Trump, who has repeatedly warned Newsom about California’s wildfire challenges, highlighted the issue in a 2019 tweet: 'The Governor of California, Gavin Newsom, has done a terrible job of forest management. I told him from the first day we met that he must ‘clean’ his forest floors regardless of what his bosses, the environmentalists, DEMAND of him. Must also do burns and cut fire stoppers.' He added that Newsom often seeks federal assistance when fires rage: 'No more. Get your act together Governor. You don’t see close to the level of burn in other states,' Trump wrote. The damage from the fires is estimated at $57 billion, including property destruction and economic losses. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skn00de6ijx	2025-01-09T03:39:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/09/BJfypSQ6Ukl/BJfypSQ6Ukl_0_250_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Pope Francis says bombing civilians and children freezing to death is unacceptable, calling the situation in Gaza 'very serious' Pope Francis on Thursday stepped up his recent criticisms of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, calling the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian enclave 'very serious and shameful.' In a yearly address to diplomats delivered on his behalf by an aide, Francis appeared to reference deaths caused by winter cold in Gaza, where there is almost no electricity. 'We cannot in any way accept the bombing of civilians,' the text said. 'We cannot accept that children are freezing to death because hospitals have been destroyed or a country's energy network has been hit.' The pope, 88, was present for the address but asked an aide to read it for him as he was recovering from a cold. The comments were part of an address to Vatican-accredited envoys from some 184 countries that is sometimes called the Pope's State of the World speech.

According to the investigation, Bushkar intended to manufacture an explosive vest for the attack. Bushkar was arrested in a joint operation by the Shin Bet and Israel Police’s Border Police undercover unit. During interrogations by the Shin Bet and the police's Northern District Unit, Bushkar admitted to consuming materials on explosive manufacturing, purchasing equipment and conducting experiments, including producing TATP explosives and constructing a pipe bomb. He reportedly planned to use these skills to create an explosive vest for carrying out attacks. Investigators revealed that Bushkar attempted to recruit two individuals to assist in his plans but failed. The investigation further uncovered that the May 2021 Gaza conflict and the current war served as sources of inspiration for Bushkar’s activities.

Israel steps up efforts to free researcher held hostage in Iraq	Family of Elizabeth Tsurkov meets Israeli and international hostage negotiators as Jerusalem seeks third-party pressure on Iraq, eyeing potential shift with new US leadership The family of Elizabeth Tsurkov, an Israeli doctoral student abducted in Iraq in 2023, met Wednesday in Jerusalem with Israel's coordinator for hostages and missing persons, Gal Hirsch, and foreign hostage negotiators visiting Israel. The meeting aimed to incorporate international negotiators and their governments into ongoing efforts to pressure Iraq to locate Tsurkov, officials said. Israel has ramped up diplomatic initiatives, involving third-party nations, to secure Tsurkov’s release. Israeli officials are hopeful that shifting regional dynamics in the wake of the war with Hamas and the upcoming inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on January 20 will prompt the Iraqi government to resolve the case. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Tsurkov, 36, an Israeli national with Russian citizenship residing in the United States for her Princeton University doctoral studies, was abducted on March 26, 2023, in Baghdad while conducting research.

In April 2023, a senior U.S. official told Ynet that President Joe Biden had planned to demand Tsurkov’s immediate release during a White House meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. The official said that Biden was closely monitoring the case and had urged Iraqi leaders to prioritize locating and freeing Tsurkov.

During an event, Emma interrupted the prime minister’s remarks and lambasted him for his perceived inaction.

They are ranking government employees and you should be ashamed of yourself that you're not doing anything to help her and save her,' she said, referring to Kataib Hezbollah.

At least 37 people have been killed in clashes between Kurdish forces and Turkish-backed militias in northern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported Thursday. The UK-based monitoring group said heavy fighting is ongoing between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led rebel organization, and the Turkey-supported Syrian National Army. The violence is concentrated in northern Syria, a region where tensions between Kurdish factions and Turkish-aligned groups have long simmered. Turkey views the SDF as an extension of the PKK, a Kurdish group it designates as a terrorist organization. The clashes come amid broader instability in the war-torn country, with competing interests and foreign interventions further complicating efforts to achieve peace. Turkey has conducted multiple military incursions into northern Syria in recent years, seeking to curb Kurdish influence near its border.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk7to11pi1x	2025-01-08T23:42:37-08:00

Belgium’s outgoing Prime Minister Alexander De Croo emphasized the need to avoid 'double standards.' Germany, grappling with its historic obligations to Israel, remains undecided. Poland’s stance is critical given its historical ties to Jewish communities and the Holocaust.

Israeli officials confirmed Netanyahu’s absence was not planned, saying, 'It wasn’t on the agenda, and no invitation was received.' In contrast to the 75th-anniversary commemoration, which saw then-President Reuven Rivlin attend, President Isaac Herzog and Netanyahu will not travel to Poland. Israeli representation will likely fall to Education Minister Yoav Kisch, replacing initial plans for Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar. The event, anticipated to host dozens of world leaders, underscores Poland's historical role in Holocaust memory. With Jewish victims forming the majority of Auschwitz’s victims, Netanyahu’s absence highlights growing geopolitical tensions. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk7b00ep8jg	2025-01-08T22:30:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/02/18/9071266/9071266_1_22_980_552_0_small.jpg

Iran 'defeated very badly' in Syria, general admits and blames Ru...	Brig. Gen. Behrouz Esbati blasts Assad for rejecting Iranian proposals to use Syrian territory as staging ground for attacks on Israel, claims Russian forces misled Tehran by bombing open fields instead of rebel strongholds A senior Iranian military official overseeing operations in Syria has publicly acknowledged Iran was 'defeated very badly' in the war-torn country, marking a stark departure from Tehran's previous narrative of strategic resilience. 'I don’t consider losing Syria something to be proud of,' said Brig. Gen. Behrouz Esbati according to an audio recording of remarks delivered the remarks during a speech at a Tehran mosque, which was later disseminated through Iranian media. 'We were defeated, and defeated very badly, we took a very big blow and it’s been very difficult.' Esbati, who coordinated Iranian military operations in Syria and liaised with both Syrian and Russian officials, described the fall of Damascus as a strategic blow. He further criticized Iran's relationship with ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad, citing strained ties due to Assad's rejection of Tehran’s proposals to allow Iranian-backed militias to open a front against Israel from Syrian territory. Esbati accused Russia, a key ally of both Iran and Assad, of undermining Iranian efforts. He claimed Russian forces misled Tehran by bombing open fields instead of rebel strongholds and deactivating radar systems when Israeli forces targeted Iranian assets in Syria. The general also revealed that Iran had presented Assad with 'comprehensive military plans' to utilize its forces in Syria for attacks on Israel. However, he noted that Assad's refusal to cooperate contributed to the collapse of his regime. Esbati said that he was on the last Iranian flight out of Damascus the night before the capital fell to rebel forces. During his speech, Esbati addressed audience questions, including whether Iran plans further retaliation for the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. He confirmed that April and October missile attacks on Israel were part of Iran's response but added that a third strike was unrealistic given current circumstances. Esbati vowed to mobilize resistance against the new Syrian leadership under Ahmad al-Sharaa, leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. 'We can activate all the networks we have worked with over the years,' he said. 'We can activate the social layers that our guys lived among for years; we can be active in social media and we can form resistance cells.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He added, 'Now we can operate there as we do in other international arenas, and we have already started.' However, a senior IRGC official told The Times that these ambitions appear more aspirational than practical. Esbati attributed the collapse of Assad's regime to corruption, political repression, economic hardship and inadequate public services, including electricity and fuel shortages. He claimed Iran had repeatedly warned Assad to implement reforms, which were ignored. When questioned about Iran's reluctance to strike U.S. military bases in the Middle East, Esbati cited the risk of significant retaliation from the United States and its allies. He admitted that Iran's simpler missiles are incapable of penetrating advanced U.S. defense systems, limiting Tehran’s ability to escalate. Despite admitting to severe setbacks, Esbati maintained that Iran and its allies still hold significant influence in the region. He suggested that chaos in Syria could ultimately benefit Iran by creating opportunities for greater leverage. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skwge1puyl	2025-01-08T20:53:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/14/BJeoRTo94Jx/BJeoRTo94Jx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Is Hamas playing Israel in hostage negotiations?	Middle East analysts say Hamas is using hostage negotiations to pressure Israel while the Biden administration’s policies have worsened the situation Hamas is not genuinely interested in a hostage-for-ceasefire deal, according to two leading Middle East experts. Speaking on ILTV’s Insider this week, Israeli analyst Yoni Ben-Menachem argued that even President-elect Donald Trump’s threats against Hamas are unlikely to be taken seriously. 'I think that the more he talks about this hostage deal and then threatens Hamas, he is losing his credibility because Hamas doesn't take him seriously,' Ben-Menachem said. He explained that Trump lacks direct influence over the terror organization or mediators like Egypt and Qatar. 'Egypt is very unstable internally, and the relationship between Trump and Qatar’s ruler, Sheikh Tamim ibn Hamad Al Thani, is such that Trump will not want to threaten him,' he added. 'I think the situation is very gloomy,' Ben-Menachem concluded. 'A Series of Missteps' How did things reach this point? Lt. Col. (Res.) Maurice Hirsch, who also appeared on Insider, blamed the Biden administration for what he described as a series of critical errors. 'The Biden administration managed to step on every landmine on the way to destroying Israel's capability to really get rid of Hamas, to annihilate Hamas, and to rescue the hostages,' Hirsch said. He pointed to specific decisions, including the aid allowed into Gaza. 'I think that forcing Israel to pour millions of tons of aid into the Gaza Strip through the hands of Hamas was a terrible mistake, which we are paying for to this day,' Hirsch said. He also criticized delays in Israel’s military actions. 'The idea of holding the IDF up from attacking in Rafah, which we saw the U.S. administration do for quite a long time, really proved to be disastrous. And so I don't think that anything the Biden administration really suggested was operable,' he said. Hirsch dismissed the possibility of a sustainable ceasefire, suggesting that Hamas was using the idea of a deal as a tactic. 'They’re all just tricks to play with Israel's heartstrings and drag the situation out even more, putting more pressure on Israel instead of on the terrorists themselves,' Hirsch explained. 'Israel’s Mistakes in Gaza' While critical of international actors, Ben-Menachem acknowledged that Israel has made its own mistakes. He contrasted Israel’s performance in Gaza with its operations in the north against Hezbollah. 'We see a lot of good results on the Northern Front, but on the Southern Front, the army made a lot of mistakes in Gaza and is still making mistakes,' Ben-Menachem said. He called for a major overhaul of Israel’s strategy. 'I think that the whole strategy should be completely changed,' he added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj0tfkaike	2025-01-08T20:52:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/08/rylYa2cj81x/rylYa2cj81x_0_222_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Military to recognize approximately 8,000 lone reservists, granting them expanded benefits such as increased financial assistance and mental health support; 'The timing of mental health treatment is critical,' says MK Oded Forer The Knesset Immigration, Absorption and Diaspora Affairs Committee announced Wednesday that the IDF will formally recognize reservists who were formerly lone soldiers as 'lone reservists,' granting them additional benefits and mental health support. The decision follows public outcry over the challenges faced by reservists without family support, sparked by the testimony of Lt. Col. (res.) Aryeh Dergel, who shared his struggles with financial and mental health crises in November. The issue gained further attention after additional cases of hardship were reported. The new designation will apply to about 8,000 reserve soldiers lacking family support. Benefits include increased financial reimbursements, subsidized flights, gift vouchers and mental health services. The IDF revealed that since the war began, 13,000 lone reserve soldiers have served, including 8,300 singles, 2,401 married and 157 divorced soldiers. Of these, 7,963 will now be recognized as 'lone reservists,' with 5,359 serving in frontline units and 2,604 in rear units.

'The timing of mental health treatment is critical. The quicker, more accessible and effective the treatment, the better we can prevent crises and help soldiers return to their daily lives,' Forer emphasized. Daniel Aharon, CEO of Ach Gadol for Lone Soldiers, welcomed the decision: 'Today, we took another step toward recognizing and honoring the lone reserve soldiers who once again dropped everything to defend the State of Israel. Thanks to Committee Chair MK Oded Forer, who brought together the IDF and relevant parties to ensure these soldiers are not alone, even in reserve duty.' Expanded benefits package and mental health support Expanded benefits, expected to take effect in January 2025 pending approval of final criteria, include: Doubling reimbursements for personal and home maintenance expenses. Gift vouchers and flight subsidies of up to 5,000 shekels ($1,364). Two personal errand days during reserve duty. Hotel accommodations for Rosh Hashanah and Passover events. Workshops easing the transition out of reserve duty. Mental health support is a central component of the initiative. Col. Avishag Sabag Reuven, head of the reserves branch in the IDF, said updated 'Resilience' and 'Standing at the Gate' workshops will specifically address the needs of lone reservists. Col. Si Pivko, head of the IDF’s welfare and social services division, emphasized the military's commitment: 'Since the war began, we have distributed gift vouchers worth NIS 5 million to lone reservists, and we will continue to do so.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkgrgn2l1e	2025-01-08T20:25:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/18/BklqT11jdMyx/BklqT11jdMyx_0_0_1600_901_0_small.jpg

Israeli consul general: World must take Iran's threats seriously	Ofir Akunis: 'We are the first front, but Europe is the second front, and the United States is the third front' When Iran declares its intention to attack Israel, Europe, and the United States, world leaders should take the threat seriously, warns Israeli Consul General in New York, Ofir Akunis. Speaking to ILTV this week, Akunis emphasized the danger posed by Iran's aggressive rhetoric. He said, 'We are the first front, but Europe is the second front, and the United States is the third front. They’re saying it openly now.'

This country is the world's least antisemitic – can you guess whe...	Interview with Taiwanese Ambassador to Israel Ya-Ping (Abby) Lee: ‘A lot of Taiwanese see a reflection in Israel’ There are only 700 Jews living among Taiwan’s population of 23.5 million people, yet the country is considered one of the least, if not the least, antisemitic nations in the world. 'We are very honored to say that Taiwan is the least antisemitic country in the world,' said Taiwanese Ambassador to Israel Ya-Ping (Abby) Lee. Speaking on the most recent episode of the ILTV News Podcast, Lee noted that while there is no official ranking of least and most antisemitic countries, the travel risk map published by Israel’s National Security Council consistently shows Taiwan in green. This indicates zero risk for Jews or Israelis traveling to the country. Additionally, Taiwan received a badge of honor from a former Israeli ambassador for its efforts to incorporate Holocaust education into its curriculum and broader community. While Jews have likely lived in Taiwan sporadically over the years, it wasn’t until 2021 that the country’s first synagogue opened. Taiwan’s predominant religions are Taoism, Buddhism, and Christianity. The synagogue and cultural center in Taipei serves as a second home for Jewish residents and visitors, as well as a hub for locals to learn more about Jewish traditions. It includes a museum showcasing beautiful ancient Jewish artifacts discovered in the region and a kosher restaurant that offers a unique fusion of traditional Jewish and Taiwanese cuisine. 'The voice of the Jewish diaspora in Taiwan is getting stronger and stronger,' Lee emphasized. Although Israel is not among the dozen countries that have officially recognized Taiwan’s independence from China, the two nations share a close bond, Lee explained. This connection is rooted in their mutual struggles and opportunities to work together in complementary ways. 'A lot of Taiwanese see a reflection in Israel,' she told ILTV. 'While you are facing a lot of challenges externally, you are so united together in fighting for the survival of the country. This is the inspiration for Taiwanese society.' Though the countries are more than 8,000 kilometers apart, Lee described them as 'neighbors in values.' 'We share the same democratic values. We safeguard freedom and human rights, and of course, we are modern states. We face many challenges to our survival, but while dealing with those challenges, we never give up hope or our belief in humanity and resilience,' she said. Both nations also share a reliance on human capital due to a lack of natural resources. 'So both countries pay a lot of attention to education, and we know that we need to keep innovating in order to thrive under threat,' Lee explained.

The Secret Weapon for Israel's Future: Faith-Based Diplomacy Tucker Carlson, Anti-Zionism, and the Rise of the Woke Right: What’s Happening? Taiwan has demonstrated its support for Israel since October 7, providing financial and emotional assistance to convey that Israel is not alone. Just as Taiwanese sovereignty is not determined by the number of countries that recognize it, neither is Israel’s right to exist. 'It is not easy for small countries to deal with pressure from bullies, especially when these bullies have hybrid toolkits to coerce you, including military intimidation and economic coercion,' Lee said. 'But we know that democracy should speak with one voice. When the axis of upheavals works together, democracies should coordinate their actions, stand in solidarity, and reinforce one another.' Today, Taiwan is Israel’s fourth-largest market in Asia. Their tech ecosystems complement each other, with Taiwan excelling in hardware and Israel in software. Over the past three decades, the two nations have signed 34 government-to-government cooperation agreements across fields such as medicine, agriculture, and technology. 'We always believe that the cooperation between two countries can generate synergies beyond imagination,' Lee said. Israel also has much to learn from Taiwan. While Lee is the only female ambassador representing Taiwan in the Middle East, women make up 42% of Taiwan’s parliamentary members, compared to only 25% in Israel. 'We pay a lot of attention to women’s empowerment and strive to reinforce gender equality in Taiwan through government policies and social movements,' Lee said. Lee sees Israel as her 'home away from home.' She is impressed by the freshness and diversity of Israeli food and has developed a fondness for hummus and schnitzel, calling Israeli cuisine 'amazing.' 'Taiwan has always been called a paradise for foodies,' Lee quipped in conclusion, 'so my comment has some level of credibility.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1lwla28kl	2025-01-08T18:53:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/10/21/r1Po9pjJNj/r1Po9pjJNj_0_103_1000_563_0_small.jpg

The move comes in response to increased efforts by anti-Israel activists to target IDF personnel abroad. The policy, effective immediately, applies to all personnel from the rank of brigadier general and below. It affects thousands of active-duty and reserve soldiers, including battalion, company and brigade commanders from standard units—not just elite forces—who frequently gave public interviews in the aftermath of the October 7 Hamas attack.

Inside Israel’s secret underground prison: How Israel detains Ham...	Smart cameras monitoring vital signs and 'minimal conditions under international law': Israel unveils Rakefet, its underground prison housing Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists, including October 7 massacre perpetrators The Israel Prison Service (IPS) provided a rare sneak peek at its 'Rakefet' wing on Wednesday, a highly classified underground complex at Nafha Prison, where dozens of Hamas Nukhba terrorists and Hezbollah’s Radwan unit members are held. The wing is one of the most advanced and secure in the IPS, equipped with cutting-edge technology. Smart cameras are installed in every cell, capable of monitoring and tracking every movement of the prisoners. The underground facility was reopened after it was shut down in the 1970s when it housed some of Israel’s most dangerous criminals, but its operations were halted following two major incidents: one, the murder of a criminal caught on the facility’s cameras, and the other, the smuggling of a gun to an inmate. After those events, the IPS decided to close the complex. However, due to the war and the detention of numerous terrorists, the wing has now been reopened for the incarceration of security prisoners. According to IPS, the conditions under which the terrorists are held are 'minimal' and comply with international law, with each prisoner receiving one hour of daily exercise. A prison official added that the conditions in the underground complex are basic, which allows for maximum control over the detainees, all while adhering to legal requirements. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The conditions in the Rakefet wing are among the harshest in the IPS,' said the facility’s commander. 'The prisoners held here participated in the October 7 massacre, and they are extremely dangerous, highly trained operatives. The IPS must remain vigilant at all times, as extraordinary events can happen at any moment.' The wing is equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance systems, including biometric cameras installed in every cell to continuously monitor the prisoners’ presence and vital signs. These cameras allow the IPS to know exactly who is in each cell at any given time. 'The Rakefet wing is a perfect example of the IPS’s approach, using advanced technology to minimize the variety of security threats posed by its detainees,' said IPS Chief Commissioner Kobi Yaakobi. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir also commented on the facility, stating, 'This is the natural place for terrorists—underground.' He went on to express his hope that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would support the advancement of the death penalty for terrorists. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryetbshl1l	2025-01-08T12:16:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/08/r195Bm281g/r195Bm281g_0_217_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

To counter rising efforts targeting IDF troops abroad, military orders all combat personnel, from brigadier general and below, to remain anonymous; photos from combat zones require special approval, and legal briefings will precede any interviews In a significant directive issued Wednesday by IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military will now conceal the identities of all soldiers and officers involved in operational combat activities. The move comes in response to increased efforts by anti-Israel activists to target IDF personnel abroad. The policy, effective immediately, applies to all personnel from the rank of brigadier general and below. It affects thousands of active-duty and reserve soldiers, including battalion, company and brigade commanders from standard units—not just elite forces—who frequently gave public interviews in the aftermath of the October 7 Hamas attack. While existing images and footage of these individuals will not be retroactively altered, all future appearances will adhere to the new guidelines. The IDF’s International Law Division will personally brief soldiers and officers before any interviews, and combat zone images featuring personnel will require special authorization before publication. The measure ensures that the identity of infantry soldiers will be protected as an Air Force pilot or a commander in the naval or commando units. Increased risks abroad The decision follows rising threats against IDF personnel traveling abroad, including from organizations like the Hind Rajab Foundation, reportedly operated by Lebanon-based pro-terror activists in Belgium. Recent complaints filed by the foundation led to a Brazilian judge ordering an investigation into an IDF soldier vacationing in the country, prompting the soldier to flee. Concerns over such incidents have grown since reports surfaced last month of soldiers being warned against travel due to the risk of arrest or interrogation. Some IDF personnel had to leave foreign countries abruptly, while others were advised against traveling altogether. The International Criminal Court’s (ICC) decision to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, has intensified fears of international legal actions against IDF officers and soldiers. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF has long urged personnel who served in Gaza to avoid posting images or videos from the war, which could be used as evidence in war crimes investigations. Despite these warnings, many soldiers violated military orders, leading to the creation of 'blacklists' by pro-Palestinian organizations in Europe and elsewhere. These lists are compiled using social media content and other publicly available materials. To mitigate these risks, the IDF now evaluates travel requests on a case-by-case basis, particularly for those who served in Gaza. While soldiers are not explicitly banned from traveling abroad, the military assesses the risks for each applicant, focusing on commanders and combatants involved in Gaza operations. The new policy reflects the IDF’s growing concern over the potential misuse of images and information against its personnel in international legal proceedings. With pro-Palestinian groups operating a vast network across Europe and other regions, the military aims to shield its soldiers from legal and personal risks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkb5xv2uyl	2025-01-08T11:42:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/04/B1ADawTX1e/B1ADawTX1e_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Judge calls out unequal police treatment of anti-government and H...	Ultra-Orthodox boy, 14, arrested in Jerusalem light rail protest released under lenient conditions; judge accuses police of unequal enforcement, contrasting harsh treatment of ultra-Orthodox with leniency toward anti-government protesters A Jerusalem youth court judge sharply criticized police on Wednesday for their handling of a 14-year-old boy’s arrest during a protest against light rail construction in the city. Police alleged the teen assaulted a female officer during Monday’s demonstration, but the boy denied the claim, with his lawyer asserting he merely bumped into her while walking on the sidewalk. Judge Gad Arenberg released the teen under significantly lighter conditions than those sought by police and accused law enforcement of selective enforcement. 'The police’s approach to protesters is not uniform,' the judge said, referencing differences between protests involving ultra-Orthodox demonstrators and those in other areas, such as anti-government protests in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. At the hearing, police requested stringent release conditions, including full house arrest outside Jerusalem, a ban on participating in protests for 180 days, a third-party guarantee of 20,000 shekels ($5,200), and a cash deposit of 8,000 shekels ($2,100). Police argued the protests disrupted construction and traffic and had been declared illegal. However, they noted the boy said he had not participated in the protest. The teen’s lawyer, Shlomo Haddad, described him as an orphan who denied the allegations. Judge Arenberg reviewed the case and deemed the police’s demands excessive. 'The requested conditions exceed those typically imposed for other protests in places like Kaplan or Gaza Street. Release terms should not vary based on protesters’ religious affiliation or other characteristics,' he wrote in his decision. The judge ultimately imposed far lighter conditions, including a 60-day ban from the light rail construction site, a third-party guarantee of 5,000 shekels ($1,300), and a cash deposit of 1,000 shekels ($260). Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Four adults were also arrested during the protest. Police sought similar stringent release conditions for them, but Judge Arenberg reduced most of these demands, except for one detainee accused of assaulting an officer. The judge reiterated that conditions should be applied fairly across all protests, emphasizing, 'Every protester believes they are demonstrating for an issue important to them.' Attorney Haddad said: 'The court's release decision speaks for itself. The court criticized the police for acting inequitably, leaving no doubt that this is a case of selective enforcement against the ultra-Orthodox community concerning protests. The police treat Kaplan protesters and those advocating for the release of hostages with kid gloves while taking a far harsher approach toward the ultra-Orthodox community, including the use of unreasonable force.' He further claimed that indictments for similar charges have been filed only against ultra-Orthodox protesters. The Israel Police responded: 'First, we emphasize that any attempt to attribute selective enforcement to the police is unfounded and undermines the hard work of officers who operate day and night to ensure the safety of all citizens of Israel. The suspect was arrested during a violent disturbance involving physical confrontations with police, including attacks on officers using pepper spray, stone-throwing, and damage to light rail infrastructure. Two officers were injured during the incident, including a policewoman allegedly attacked by the suspect, who was arrested and brought before the court for release under conditions in consultation with the prosecution.' The police added: 'On December 24, the District Court ruled in an appeal concerning the release conditions set by the Magistrate’s Court (Judge Chavi Toker) on December 23 for individuals arrested during an unauthorized gathering. The court stated: 'The need for a suspect's arrest, as well as the conditions of their release, should not be determined based on sectoral affiliation. A detailed examination is required for each case and each respondent regarding the nature and strength of the detention grounds and the measures necessary to address them while avoiding undue harm to the suspect’s rights.'' The court’s decision regarding one of the respondents said: 'The respondent was found at an unauthorized gathering protesting light rail construction in Jerusalem. According to investigative materials, during the gathering—marked by derogatory chants toward police—he and others entered a pit at the site, resisted removal by interlocking arms with others, and was eventually removed by officers.' The police further noted: 'Operational reports show that the gathering disrupted work at the site, involved additional participants, and caused a road blockage. Such incidents frequently occur at light rail construction sites, posing a public interest in preventing their recurrence. This is necessary to avoid repeated disruptions to construction intended for the public’s benefit, road closures on major routes, and to free Jerusalem police—already stretched thin due to the ongoing war and security situation—for essential tasks. The need for action is highlighted by the persistence of such incidents over several years.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skm7783i1e	2025-01-08T11:13:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2021/01/25/S1FySZh3Jd/S1FySZh3Jd_0_0_1280_853_0_small.jpg
IDF confirms 3 soldiers killed in Gaza tank blast	Staff Sgt. Matityahu Ya’akov Perel, 22, from Beit El, and Staff Sgt. Kenew Kasa, 22, from Beit Shemesh, both tank crew members in the 46th Battalion killed in Beit Hanoun; third soldier’s name unreleased Three Israeli soldiers were killed Wednesday when a tank from the 46th Battalion of the IDF’s 401st Brigade hit a booby-trapped pit in Beit Hanoun, northern Gaza, causing a large explosion, the military said. The names of two of the fallen soldiers have been released: Staff Sgt. Matityahu Ya’akov Perel, 22, from Beit El, and Staff Sgt. Kenew Kasa, 22, from Beit Shemesh, both tank crew members in the 46th Battalion. A third soldier’s name remains under a publication ban. Another soldier sustained serious injuries in the incident and was evacuated to a hospital, where his family was notified. Since the war began, 830 Israeli soldiers have been killed. The ground maneuver in Gaza, which started on October 27, 2023, has accounted for 395 of these fatalities. To date, 5,589 soldiers have been injured, including 822 seriously. Seventeen soldiers in serious condition remain hospitalized. The unit struck on Wednesday was operating under the Nahal Brigade’s reconnaissance forces as part of an ongoing operation targeting Hamas’ local battalion in Beit Hanoun. Explosives have emerged as a major threat in the area, the IDF said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Initial investigations revealed that two officers from the Nahal Brigade—Maj. Dvir Zion Revah and Capt. Eitan Israel Shiknazi—killed in combat on Monday, were also victims of explosive devices rather than anti-tank missiles as initially believed. The operation in Beit Hanoun, which began in late December, is one of the final key stages of the IDF’s campaign in northern Gaza, now in its third month. Soldiers have uncovered weapons stockpiles and operational tunnels still used by Hamas fighters. Last weekend, Kfir Brigade forces destroyed the 'Officers’ Neighborhood' in Beit Hanoun, a strategic area that overlooked the Israeli city of Sderot. Southern Command estimates that civilians will not be permitted to return to Beit Hanoun after the fighting concludes. Staff Sgt.

She was last seen in Istanbul, Turkey, where she had traveled with her father and brother—both of whom are facing charges of assaulting her earlier this year. According to an indictment filed in March 2024, Sarsour’s father, Shahin Sarsour, and her brother, Ashraf Sarsour, allegedly assaulted and threatened her on multiple occasions, accusing her of communicating with men.

The time to act is now': Israeli-American family fights for retu...	After having spoken on every possible platform, met with international leaders, and 30 days after receiving the news of their son's death on Oct. 7, they continue the fight for his return More than 30 days have passed since the Neutra family was informed of the devastating loss of their son, Captain Omer Neutra, 22, an IDF officer who was killed in action on October 7. Despite the news, Omer remains among the 100 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Omer’s parents, Orna and Ronen, launched a global campaign for his release, meeting with leaders in Israel, the U.S. and beyond, while sharing messages of hope for their son. The chief military rabbi confirmed Omer’s death after reviewing evidence from the attack. Born and raised in Long Island, NY, Omer moved to Israel as a lone soldier to enlist in the IDF, where he served as a tank commander. On October 7, he and his tank crew—Nimrod Cohen, Shaked Dahan and Oz Daniel—were abducted during the massacre. A haunting image of their burning tank, surrounded by cheering terrorists, became a grim symbol of that day. Nimrod Cohen is also believed to be in Gaza. 'For 422 days, we were fighting for Omer's life. We did not have a day or a night, sleepless nights, and our days were filled with meetings, travel, rallies and doing everything that we could that we felt was in our power to bring Omer back,' said Omer's father Ronen. 'When they notified us that he was killed on October 7, that was devastating. And he's not back yet. We still have to fight to bring him back and the State of Israel owes it to him to bring him back for proper burial with the respect that he deserves. He didn't have to do what he chose to do. He volunteered to be a protector because those were his values. And the fact that he's not back means that we still need to fight. We don't have the hope anymore to see him alive, but we owe it to him to bring him back.' How do you hold a shiva without a body? 'We were in shock. You want to run away from this news, you really don't want to deal with it, and you have to,' said Orna. 'In this crazy reality, outwardly, nothing has changed. They haven't brought Omer back. Omer is still in an unknown place in Gaza. we don't have him. There's no grave, no funeral, what do you do?' 'We made a decision that we would hold a shiva but we will continue to fight. We decided to split the shiva and do it in both New York and Israel. In the past year, since we received the news that Omer had been kidnapped, we have waged a very intense struggle, and in our path in this struggle, the entire Jewish American community and other communities have rallied around us, and they have basically asked us to hold a shiva in New York as well, because so many people want to come and comfort you,' she added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Thousands of people turned out to console the grieving parents. 'We decided to sit in a synagogue, in the community center,' says Ronen. 'We arrived on the first day and were in shock. At the entrance, hundreds of police officers and cavalry were waiting, similar to a procession of a fallen U.S. service member or police officer. The flag was lowered to half-mast, the governor came and sat with us. There was a minute of silence in Congress, and hundreds of people every day stood in long lines just waiting to come and shake our hands, to offer us 30 seconds of comfort. 'We realized that Omer is no longer just our child, he is a kind of symbol of the sacrifice and support of the Jewish community in Israel, the love for Israel, the sacrifice and heroism that Omer showed, and the symbolism that he transformed over these months into our struggle. We felt that we gave the community a place to show the pain and grief, the open wound that the hostages represent for the entire Jewish people, both in Israel and abroad.' Neutra, raised in New York and steeped in the values of the Conservative Jewish movement, was driven by deep Zionist convictions to make Israel his home. After completing a preparatory program, he remained in Israel, joining the IDF and serving as a soldier and commander in the Armored Corps. 'Omer is a very sociable person,' according to Orna. 'During the shiva and throughout this period, people told us how he influenced them, and their lives, how he changed them. He also did for Israel. He would speak about the country with true, deep love. He would say, 'Let me talk about my friend, Israel.'' 'Our son did not have to enlist,' Ronen continued. 'He did it out of pure Zionism, out of love for Israel and out of adherence to the values of mutual responsibility. The entire Jewish community in the United States is crying over Omer and everything that is happening in the country, all in solidarity. This wound of the hostages must be healed. And the way to heal it is for everyone to return, in the announcement that we have reached the end of the war, to move on. To rehabilitate society, to form a real commission of inquiry, to draw conclusions and make corrections. 'We still haven't received a serious investigation into what happened in our son's tank. It was only a few weeks ago that we heard the communication tape. We heard our son calling for help, asking them to come and rescue his soldier, who was killed there, and help didn't come. The crew was suffocating, Omer asked them to breathe through the air vents, while he continued to beg for help. And 15 months later, we are still fighting to bring him home.' The Israeli American Neutra family is waging their battle on two fronts, appealing to leadership in both Israel and the United States. 'We've actually been seeing this all year, at various points while we've met with ministers or the prime minister himself,' Orna says. 'The messages we're getting are that the conditions are not ripe for a deal, that there's more work to be done, that the IDF needs more achievements, and I think we've been through a lot in these 15 months, and the IDF has achieved a lot. And the reality has changed, and they're still not here. When Trump was elected, we thought there was momentum, and time was passing, and it's not happening. It's worrying, it's frustrating. The sense of urgency is that everything should have happened a long time ago, but nothing has happened yet. 'We are part of a struggle and part of a story. And it is completely clear to us that we have a role, we understood this from day one, that keeping the issue of the hostages in the United States in the apolitical discourse is perhaps one of the only issues that unites Democrats and Republicans. When President Trump was elected, we realized that we needed to push for the issue of the hostages not to wait until he took office, but for the teams to work on it together in advance. 'There was actually a meeting with Trump and President Biden, we met a few hours later with President Biden at the White House and he updated us on things. At the first candle of Hanukkah, we met with Netanyahu, and we decided to support him. To bring the public's pain that we felt in the shiva, and to tell him that it is time. They say that the conditions have ripened, will ripen, are ripening. Do you know what happens to fruit that ripens too much? He is falling.' 'It is worrying, because it could very well be that some of the living abductees will not return alive, and some of the dead will not return to their families and will not have a burial in the Land of Israel, and that scares us,' Omer's father concluded. 'Very much. So if the conditions are ripe - the time to act is now. It is not entirely clear how this will affect society going forward. I think the community we come from understands this well, I think most Israelis understand this, and still the Israeli government is taking its time.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj05111381e	2025-01-08T09:32:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/05/rJffWSV00Iyl/rJffWSV00Iyl_0_262_961_541_0_small.jpg
No IDF withdrawal without Lebanese Army action against Hezbollah,...	Officials stress IDF operations in Lebanon hinge on adherence to cease-fire, warning of escalation if framework collapses; concerns raised over Lebanese Army’s ability to counter Hezbollah, which seeks to return to southern Lebanon unarmed Israeli officials affirmed Wednesday that the military would not withdraw from its positions in southern Lebanon unless the Lebanese Army fulfills its obligations under a cease-fire agreement. A key provision of the accord requires Hezbollah’s removal from south of the Litani River, a condition that remains unmet. Hezbollah has reportedly expressed willingness to return to southern Lebanon unarmed, but Israel has rejected this, insisting on full compliance with the agreement. The deal also prohibits the rebuilding of buildings previously used for terrorist activities. Israeli officials have clarified that such sites, deemed 'terrorist infrastructure,' will not be restored. Concerns over the Lebanese Army’s effectiveness were raised during a Security Cabinet meeting. 'They are weak,' an Israeli official said, adding that Christian-led units take action, whereas those led by Shia commanders often cooperate with Hezbollah. While the U.S.-led enforcement mechanism is seen as sound, its reliance on the Lebanese Army has proven less effective than anticipated. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Despite these challenges, senior officials stressed that breaking the cease-fire agreement is not Israel’s objective. 'We don’t want this scenario but must be ready,' said an Israeli official, noting the IDF’s operational plans to expand maneuvers if the agreement collapses. Ensuring the safety of returning residents, they said, remains a top priority. Border disputes and strategic positions Negotiations over contested border points continue to create tension. Lebanon has raised claims to 13 specific locations, while Israel has sought adjustments of its own. According to Lebanon’s pro-Hezbollah Al-Akhbar newspaper, the cease-fire oversight committee approved the IDF’s continued presence at three strategic positions in southern Lebanon beyond the agreement’s 60-day framework. The report identified the sites as Labbouneh Forest near Israel’s western Galilee, Jabal Balat opposite the Israeli border towns of Shtula and Zar'it, and Tallat al-Hamams overlooking Metula. Meanwhile, the IDF remains active in southern Lebanon. Over the past 24 hours, Israeli forces destroyed five weapons storage facilities, according to a military spokesperson. Troops from the 300th Brigade's Combat Team under the 146th Division continue operations aimed at dismantling terror infrastructure while adhering to the cease-fire terms. Israel’s approach reflects a balance between upholding the agreement and safeguarding its security. Officials emphasized that any withdrawal is contingent on strict adherence to the cease-fire provisions by all parties involved. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj1sgw2iyg	2025-01-08T09:08:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/SynNRBPb8ke/SynNRBPb8ke_0_0_1601_901_0_small.jpg

Amnesty International suspends Israel chapter over 'racism' alleg...	Human rights NGO claims Israeli branch discriminated against Palestinian workers and failed to follow organizational messaging in reports; Amnesty Israel denies allegations Amnesty International has suspended its Israeli chapter for two years, citing allegations of discrimination against Palestinians and discrepancies between its internal reports and the organization's global line, which accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. Amnesty Israel rejected claims of discrimination against Palestinian employees. While agreeing with the global organization's conclusions on violations of international law, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing by Israel, Amnesty Israel contested the genocide allegation, arguing that there’s insufficient evidence to support the claim. The Israeli chapter also expressed dissatisfaction with the global organization’s disregard for Israeli victims of the October 7 massacre, further straining relations. The New York Post addressed the controversy in an editorial published Tuesday, quoting opinion columnist Seth Mandel, who said the 'supposed ‘human rights’ organization' now operates on authoritarian principles.' The suspension marks a new low in the already strained relationship between Amnesty International's global leadership and its Israel branch, which has operated since 1964 and is one of the movement's oldest. The decision followed accusations from the global leadership that Amnesty Israel acted in a racist manner toward Palestinians and failed to align its reports with the organization’s official stance. Amnesty Israel denied these accusations, asserting that it has internal mechanisms for consulting both Palestinian and Jewish employees. One major point of contention was Amnesty’s 2022 apartheid report, which the Israeli branch criticized for presenting a biased and one-sided perspective. Another flashpoint was a 2023 report accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, which Amnesty Israel dismissed as inadequately substantiated. In addition to ideological differences, the Israeli chapter voiced frustration over the global organization's neglect of Israeli victims in Hamas' October 7 attack. While Amnesty International focused on the Palestinian angle, the local branch felt Israeli victims were almost entirely ignored. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The suspension has sparked internal discord within the NGO itself. Some international organization insiders alleged that the racism accusations against the Israeli branch were premeditated, part of a broader pattern by the leadership to disproportionately focus on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the expense of other issues. Amnesty Israel officials have even threatened to cease operations entirely unless there’s a significant shift in its relationship with the international leadership. At the same time, internal critics argued that the local chapter failed to integrate sufficient Palestinian representation in senior roles, contributing to internal tensions. According to Amnesty International Board Interim Chair Tiumalu Lauvale Peter Fa'afiu, the suspension of the Israeli branch aims to preserve the organization’s moral and structural integrity. Operating with significant autonomy, the Israeli branch is expected to continue its activities but faces considerable uncertainty regarding its future within the global organization and its financial sustainability. Amnesty International plans to discuss the suspension in a special meeting on January 21, during which it will determine if and how the Israeli branch may resume full participation under the organizational umbrella in the future. The current crisis between Amnesty International and its Israeli chapter stems from deep disagreements over the situation in Gaza. In early December, the global organization released a scathing report titled 'You Feel Like You Are Subhuman,' accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. Based on interviews with hundreds of witnesses and victims' families, the report asserted that Israel is acting in violation of the Genocide Convention and treating Palestinians as 'subhumans.' Amnesty Israel rejected the allegations, criticizing the global body for ignoring the victims of the October 7 massacre. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byw32rii1g	2025-01-08T05:12:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/05/SkEwFMd8Jx/SkEwFMd8Jx_0_285_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Deep, dark son of a b***h': Trump shares anti-Netanyahu video on...	Days before White House return, Donald Trump shares video of Jewish professor accusing Netanyahu of expansionist aims, undue US influence and 'genocide' in Gaza, sparking renewed debate on Trump's stance on Israel U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump may be reigniting tensions with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after sharing a video on his social media featuring a scathing critique of the Israeli leader by Columbia University Professor Jeffrey Sachs, who is Jewish. In the video, Sachs refers to Netanyahu as a 'deep, dark son of a b***h' and accuses him of being responsible for the wars in Syria and Iraq, as well as for pushing the U.S. into a potential conflict with Iran. The video, recorded on October 22, features Sachs claiming that Netanyahu has pursued a policy since the 1990s aimed at dismantling regimes that support Hamas and Hezbollah—Iran, Iraq and Syria. According to Sachs, Netanyahu was instrumental in driving U.S. involvement in wars in those countries. 'The guy is nothing if not obsessive,' Sachs says in the video. 'He’s still trying to get us to fight Iran this day, this week. He’s a deep, dark son of a b***h, I’m sorry to tell you, because he’s gotten us into endless wars. And because of the power of all of this in U.S. politics, he's gotten his way.' The video sparked immediate backlash on social media, with many questioning why Trump’s campaign chose to share such a harsh critique from one of Israel’s most vocal detractors, especially in the wake of the October 7 attacks. Some interpreted the move as a clear signal that Trump intends to distance himself from Netanyahu, while others saw it as a calculated step in the complex relationship between the two leaders. Trump has consistently advocated for ending wars in the Middle East and stated during his campaign that he has no intention of starting new wars—only ending them. However, he has refrained from committing to withholding U.S. support for an Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities. The relationship between Trump and Netanyahu has been strained in recent years, particularly after Trump accused Netanyahu of 'disloyalty' for congratulating Joe Biden on his 2020 presidential, which the Republican leader continues to contest. Interestingly, Trump’s post, which accompanied Sachs’s video, did not directly reference Netanyahu. Instead, it targeted former U.S. President Barack Obama and the American media. The post, originally shared by the 'Wall Street Apes' page, read: 'Jeffrey Sachs details how Barack Obama ordered the CIA to overthrow the Syrian government, and the American media covered it up. He says journalists either lie when blaming Russia or are unimaginably ignorant, claiming Russia intervened in Syria.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Prof. Sachs continued: 'Obama tasked the CIA to overthrow the Syrian government, starting four years before Russia intervened. What kind of nonsense is that? How many times did The New York Times report on operation Timber-Sycamore, which was the Presidential order to the CIA to overthrow Bashar al-Assad?' Sachs, known for his frequent criticism of Israel in interviews and public forums, opposes Israel’s actions in Gaza and efforts to eliminate Hamas. He has accused Israel of committing genocide and pursuing ethnic cleansing in Gaza, alleging tacit support from Washington. Sachs further claims Syria’s collapse is part of a strategic plan by Netanyahu to expand Israel’s borders. According to him, Israel rejects a two-state solution because Netanyahu seeks perpetual control over all territory between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjbipri8kg	2025-01-08T04:26:58-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/17/HyuVqARN1x/HyuVqARN1x_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
OpenAI boss denies sexually assaulting his sister after she files...	OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman has denied sexually abusing his sister when she was a child, after she filed a lawsuit in the United States accusing him of regularly sexually abusing her between 1997 and 2006. The lawsuit, filed by Ann Altman's lawyers in a U.S. District Court in Missouri, alleges counts of sexual assault and sexual battery which began when she was three and her brother was 12. It alleges the abuse continued once he became an adult and while she was still a minor. 'All of these claims are utterly untrue,' Sam Altman said in a joint statement with his mother and two brothers published on X on Jan. 7. Sam Altman, one of the co-founders of OpenAI alongside Elon Musk and others, has become one of the world's biggest tech names since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT tool in 2022. He is estimated to be worth over $1 billion, according to Forbes. His sister's lawsuit seeks damages in excess of $75,000, punitive damages, and for the costs of the lawsuit. It also requests a jury trial. The lawsuit stated that as a result of the abuse she alleges, Ann Altman had suffered post-traumatic stress disorder, severe emotional distress, mental anguish, and depression, which was expected to continue into the future.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjxdylnuyx	2025-01-08T04:12:50-08:00

Winter surge in respiratory illness in China and elsewhere not un...	Rising cases of common respiratory illnesses in China and elsewhere around the Northern Hemisphere are within the range expected for winter, with no unusual outbreaks reported, the World Health Organization said. Reports of a surge of cases in China of human metapneumovirus (hMPV), a common respiratory infection, have drawn headlines worldwide, with reports of overwhelmed hospitals recalling the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic just over five years ago. However, the WHO said in a statement on Tuesday evening that it was in contact with Chinese health officials and had not received any reports of unusual outbreak patterns there. The Chinese authorities have also informed the U.N. health agency that the health system is not overwhelmed and no emergency responses have been triggered. HMPV typically causes cold-like symptoms for a few days but can in rare cases lead to hospitalization among the very young, old or medically vulnerable. Unlike the virus that caused COVID-19, which was new, hMPV was first identified in 2001 and has likely been circulating for much longer, scientists said. A number of other countries, including India and the United Kingdom, have also reported rising cases of hMPV this winter, as well as other respiratory infections, in line with seasonal trends that can sometimes stretch hospitals.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjm7zy381g	2025-01-08T02:33:04-08:00	
Hostage Sagi never met his daughter: Lives of hostages on hold as...	Shahar never met her father, Sagi, and is already a year old; Ofer was not released from captivity with his son, Erez, and missed his bar mitzvah; Agam's twin sister completed the officers course they both dreamed of For 460 days, the families of the hostages have been waiting for their relatives to return home. In the meantime, while their lives have been stopped, the lives of their families continue without them, and they celebrate important events with endless longing and great hope of hugging them again soon. A birthday for a daughter that Sagi doesn't know Avital Dekel Chen hoped for a Hanukkah miracle that would bring her husband, Sagi, back to her, so that he would be by her side at the birth of their third daughter. But he didn't return, and Shahar was born without a father. More than a year has passed since then, and Sagi was not there on her first birthday either. 'It's a sad moment,' says Avital, 'The most important person to Shahar is an hour's drive away and can't come.' The Dekel Chen family has a tradition of making an album on birthdays with photos from the past year, but Shahar's album doesn't have a single photo with her father. 'I included Sagi's presence in the greeting I wrote for her, and I signed it off by saying that Dad and Mom love her very much. And it's so true. If there's anything that motivates Sagi to survive, it's the fact that a wife and three children are waiting for him here,' she said. Alma still calls for her father Alma Miran began to speak when she was a year old. Her first word was Or, then Mama. Her father, Omri Miran, was kidnapped when she was six months old. He doesn't know what her voice sounds like. 'When she said 'Mama', it made me happy, but it also hurt. What kind of child says 'Mama' before 'Daddy'? It's much harder,' says Lishay, Omri's wife. 'I realized I needed to use the word Daddy more often around her. The first time she said Daddy, when she looked at a picture of Omri, it moved me more than any word she said before or after. More than half his life in captivity Kfir Bibas was kidnapped when he was nine months old. 'Kfir marked his first birthday last year while he was in captivity,' says his aunt Ofri. 'He marked it separately from his father, his family and his home. He didn't receive gifts or a cake, and he didn't blow out a candle.' Crowds celebrated his birthday all over the world. Orange balloons, like his red hair, were released into the air. Child stars dedicated songs to him. 'A year ago, our wish for him was that he would come back to us,' his aunt said. A year has passed and he's still hostage there. 'Even his second birthday was taken away from him,' says Ofri. Kfir and his brother, Ariel, are the last children left in Gaza. In 10 days, Kfir will be two years old, spending more than half of his life in captivity. Bar mitzvah with a father in Gaza At a bar mitzvah, an event that symbolizes entrance into the adult world, it is customary for a father to accompany his son. But when Erez Calderon went to the synagogue about two months ago, his uncle Nissan Calderon stood by his side. Erez was forced to grow up even earlier, when he was kidnapped with his father, Ofer, and his sister, Sahar, from Kibbutz Nir Oz. Sahar and Erez were released in the hostage deal more than a year ago, Ofer was left behind in the Hamas tunnels. 'We hoped so much that after a whole year in the Hamas tunnels his father would return for a big hug with his family,' said Hadas, Erez's mother, at the time. 'It didn't happen. Enough! Bring back our Ofer.' Completing officers' course alone Agam Berger had been planning her military service since she started the pre-military preparatory school.

Iran ponders relocating capital from Tehran to southern region	Amid population density and environmental challenges, Iran is considering moving its capital to the Makran region near the Gulf of Oman; Supporters cite strategic and economic benefits, while critics warn of high costs and logistical issues Iran is planning to relocate its capital, moving it from Tehran to the southern region of the country, according to the Islamic Republic's government spokesperson. 'The new capital will definitely be in the south, in the Makran region, and we are currently working on this matter,' government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said on Tuesday. According to Mohajerani, two committees have been established to assess the feasibility of the move. She emphasized that while changing the capital is not an urgent issue, it is important for experts to thoroughly examine the matter, given Tehran’s high population density and the environmental challenges the city is facing. Residents of Tehran are currently dealing with power outages and a water crisis. The government spokesperson noted that, while the government aims to address Tehran's problems, it is also exploring ways to utilize resources in other parts of the country. Iranian media reported that discussions about changing the capital have been ongoing periodically since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 but were abandoned due to economic constraints and logistical challenges. The issue resurfaced during the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, driven by concerns over earthquakes in Tehran. Former president Hassan Rouhani also raised the topic, and now it is being addressed by the current administration under President Masoud Pezeshkian.

Italian journalist released from Iranian prison	Italian journalist Cecilia Sala has been freed from detention in Iran and is flying home, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's office said in a statement on Wednesday. Sala, 29, who had been working under a regular journalistic visa, was detained in Tehran on Dec. 19 and held in solitary confinement in the Iranian capital's notorious Evin prison. Sala was detained three days after an Iranian businessman, Mohammad Abedini, was arrested at Milan's Malpensa Airport on a U.S. warrant for allegedly supplying drone parts that Washington says were used in a 2024 attack that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan. The Italian statement said Sala had been freed 'thanks to intense work on diplomatic and intelligence channels'. It made no mention of the Abedini case.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rye8erj8kx	2025-01-08T01:49:55-08:00	
UNRWA scandal grows as ties to Hamas, other terror groups exposed	UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, faces allegations of ties with Hamas and other terrorist groups; A new report accuses the agency of enabling terrorist influence on its policies and decisions, sparking global criticism and calls for accountability The nongovernmental organization UN Watch, which monitors UN activities, has published a report exposing the alleged collaboration between UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees) and Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other terror groups. The agency, which employs 30,000 staff and oversees an annual budget of $1.5 billion funded by Western countries, reportedly allowed terrorist organizations to influence its policies and operations. The report released on Tuesday reveals that UNRWA employees, including senior local managers, regularly met with representatives of terrorist organizations in Lebanon and Gaza. During these meetings, they praised each other for their cooperation and referred to one another as 'partners.' The report claims that terrorist organizations often made demands of UNRWA and influenced its decisions. Furthermore, when UNRWA proposed actions such as suspending employees who promoted terrorism or publishing a code of ethics that included LGBTQ rights, these decisions frequently were blocked through threats. UN Watch Executive Director Hillel Neuer commented on the findings. 'This report reveals how UNRWA's senior management knowingly employs those connected to Hamas' terror activities and allows terrorist organizations to influence the agency's policies and critical decisions.' Last month, Neuer harshly criticized the UN, saying: 'It is absurd that in 2024, out of 23 UN General Assembly resolutions criticizing countries, 17 of them – almost three-quarters – focused on one country, Israel.' According to the report, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini reached an agreement with terrorist organizations during a meeting in Beirut in May 2024. As part of this agreement, UNRWA allowed senior Hamas official Fathi Al-Sharif, identified by Hamas as the movement's leader in Lebanon, to remain a school principal and head of UNRWA's teachers' union, a role influencing thousands of teachers and students. Only after the Israeli government filed an official complaint against him did the agency impose a mild punishment, suspending Al-Sharif. Hamas and other organizations responded to the suspension by shutting down UNRWA operations in Lebanon and organizing widespread demonstrations involving teachers and students. Lazzarini flew to Beirut and met with the coalition of terrorist organizations behind the strike. Local media reported that 'understandings' were reached, leading to a 'positive outcome' for Al-Sharif and the strike's termination. On September 30, 2024, Al-Sharif was killed by an Israeli missile strike. Hamas eulogized him, describing him as someone who provided his students with 'Jihadi education.' The report also highlighted how UNRWA regional managers routinely held meetings with local terrorist leaders for 'cooperation and coordination.' In a November 2017 meeting, local terrorist leaders told the UNRWA manager in Sidon, Fawzi Kassab, that UNRWA must continue to operate until Palestinian refugees 'return to their homes.' They warned that if donors ceased funding, Palestinians would launch a 'popular revolution.' Former UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krähenbühl met with Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders in February 2017, emphasizing the 'spirit of partnership' between them and the agency. He encouraged the terrorist leaders to secretly appeal any agency decisions they opposed and assured them that he could reverse such decisions following their appeals. Krähenbühl also requested that the groups ensure their discussions remain confidential to protect UNRWA's credibility. Krähenbühl, who was forced to resign in 2019 due to corruption and sexual harassment scandals, was controversially appointed this year as the Director-General of the International Committee of the Red Cross, a move that sparked strong protests from 17 U.S. senators. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In June 2022, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini emphasized the importance of 'partnership' and regularly met with terrorist organizations under the framework of the 'Joint Refugee Committee,' headed by Mahmoud Khalaf, a member of the central committee of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which the U.S. and EU classify as a terrorist organization. UNRWA managers participated in Hamas' annual conference, where internal agency matters, such as job vacancies and teachers' union elections, were discussed. At the 2021 conference, senior Hamas official Ahmad Abd Al-Hadi announced the establishment of a joint committee tasked with 'overseeing relations with UNRWA and ensuring it fulfills its commitments.' UNRWA's director in Lebanon, Claudio Cordone, visited the Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp in February 2022 to meet with a coalition of terrorist organizations, including Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Houthis. During the meeting, he was reportedly told that 'the Palestinian issue in Lebanon is political and cannot be reduced to a humanitarian or security matter.' Similarly, in January 2018, Cordone met with Al-Hadi, who stated that they support UNRWA because it 'serves as a living testimony to the 1948 Nakba.' Contrary to the narrative presented to the world, the report suggests that UNRWA's main purpose is not humanitarian aid but rather advancing the narrative that the establishment of Israel was an 'injustice' and that Palestinians will one day dismantle Israel. Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, responded to the report. 'If the world needed more evidence proving UNRWA is Hamas, here it is, laid out before you. It can no longer be denied that all that remains of UNRWA is its name. The State of Israel will not cooperate with humanitarian organizations managed by terrorist groups.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s16kt9suyg	2025-01-08T01:40:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/SJTvagjLJl/SJTvagjLJl_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

An Australian student missing for two weeks near the country's tallest mountain was found on Wednesday, after surviving by foraging for berries, drinking water from a creek and finding two muesli bars left behind by other hikers, police said. Hadi Nazari, a 23-year-old university student from Melbourne, went missing from his group of friends on December 26 in the Kosciuszko National Park. Nazari was found on Wednesday afternoon by a group of hikers who alerted the authorities, police in the state of New South Wales said. 'This is the fourteenth day we've been looking for him and for him to come out and be in such good spirits and in such great condition, it's incredible,' NSW Police Inspector Josh Broadfoot said. The student was in 'really good spirits' with no significant injuries, he added. More than 300 people had searched for Nazari across rugged bushland, police said. The national park is home to the 2,228 metre (7,310 foot) Mount Kosciuszko.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj4s7as8jx	2025-01-08T01:31:30-08:00	
Trump will not rule out force to take Panama Canal, Greenland	Incoming U.S. president hints at possibility of turning Canada into an American state and changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the 'Gulf of America', part of a broader expansionist agenda he has promoted since winning re-election U.S. President-elect Donald Trump refused on Tuesday to rule out using military or economic action to pursue the acquisition of the Panama Canal and Greenland, part of a broader expansionist agenda he has promoted since winning the November 5 election. Trump, who takes office on January 20, also floated the idea of turning Canada into a U.S. state, said he would demand far higher defense spending from NATO allies and promised to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. Still two weeks away from taking office, Trump has begun outlining an aggressive foreign policy with little regard to diplomatic considerations or the concerns of U.S. allies. Asked at a press conference at his Florida resort whether he could assure the world he would not use military or economic coercion as he tries to gain control of the Panama Canal and Greenland, Trump said, 'No, I can't assure you on either of those two. But I can say this, we need them for economic security.' Trump criticized American spending on Canadian goods and military support for Canada, saying the U.S. derives no benefits from doing so, and called the border between the two countries an 'artificially drawn line.' He suggested he would impose tariffs on Denmark if it resists his offer to purchase Greenland, which he said is vital to U.S. national security. Shortly before Trump's comments, his son Don Jr. arrived in Greenland for a private visit. Denmark has said Greenland, a self-governing part of its kingdom, is not for sale. 'I don't think it's a good way forward to fight each other with financial means when we are close allies and partners,' Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said late on Tuesday in response to Trump's comments. In recent weeks, Trump has threatened to impose massive tariffs on Mexico and Canada, which he claims are responsible for the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs reaching the U.S. borders.

IDF scrambles to combat flood of weapons into the West Bank	Troops stationed there face difficulties in capturing armed terrorists and stopping their suppliers, who smuggle weapons from Iran via Jordan; Regular infantry battalions will return from Gaza to the West Bank for the first time since October 7 As the IDF continues its operations in the West Bank trying to prevent murderous attacks such as the one that resulted in the murder of three Israelis on Monday, it still faces difficulties stopping the flood of illegal weapons making their way to the West Bank from Iran via the Jordanian border. The IDF Central Command refers to these efforts as the 'weapons campaign,' citing the over 1,100 rifles seized by troops in the past year through round-the-clock operations across the West Bank. However, a critical unknown factor remains: the IDF can't estimate the total number of weapons held by Palestinians in the West Bank, beyond the thousands of licensed firearms in the possession of Palestinian Authority security forces. According to an intelligence assessment by Central Command from two years ago, one in six Palestinian households in the West Bank contains an illegal weapon, ranging from handguns and makeshift rifles to standard AK47s or M-16s. 'We know we're on the right track based on weapon prices, which have surged this past year — from 30,000 shekels ($8,200) per long-barreled rifle to 60,000–70,000 shekels ($19,200),' a senior military official said this week. 'But when we get intel on a weapons dealer or a handgun hidden in the garden of an unregistered Palestinian, likely intended for self-defense, we'll prioritize catching the dealer.' The IDF's goal is to maintain the West Bank as a secondary front. Despite this, offensive actions within Palestinian areas remain constant, including eliminations taking place almost weekly. Presently, the IDF deploys around 20 battalions for security duties in the West Bank. While this figure is lower than during peak terrorism levels two years before the Gaza war, it remains 7–8 battalions higher than the low point in the late 2010s. However, constraints are evident. Most of these battalions are composed of reservists or units outside the compulsory infantry or armored corps, and reinforcements from Gaza are only expected next month. The Nahal Brigade's battalions will deploy to areas like Hebron and Nablus. Artillery forces are gradually returning to West Bank security tasks as they wind down operations in other arenas. 'We're acutely aware of the implications of a West Bank escalation requiring large-scale reinforcements and diverting resources and attention from Gaza, Lebanon and Syria, which remain the General Staff's primary fronts,' the military clarified. The IDF's main challenge involves handling armed processions in Palestinian cities in broad daylight. Recent efforts in the military push for units to act harshly against such displays, even if they take place during funerals. However, such attempts have so far failed: Troops dispatched to ambush armed individuals were detected, causing the armed groups to disperse quickly. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'They're careful to march near children, ensuring they're photographed. It's unclear if we'd gain anything by eliminating two armed individuals at the cost of harming three nearby children,' the military explained. They clarified that many previously avoided measures are now being implemented. Despite the increasing threat posed by high-grade explosive devices, APC deployments remain absent. Tanks also aren't expected to return to the West Bank anytime soon — last seen there during the Second Intifada in 2000 — even after an anti-tank missile was discovered in the Jenin refugee camp. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hydvocji1e	2025-01-07T23:28:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/BkMjw4YWLkx/BkMjw4YWLkx_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

This is why some of the Israeli hostages may never come home	Experts explain why the odds of rescuing all 100 hostages still held in Gaza are slim A hostage deal is looming, expected to coincide with President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20. But hopes for the release of all 100 Israeli hostages are fading fast. Despite any concessions Israel may offer, experts warn the chances of bringing everyone home are slim — a sobering reality in the aftermath of the devastating October 7 attacks. 'I always talk about the release of hostages rather than the release of the hostages,' cautioned professional negotiator Moty Cristal, a seasoned expert who served on Israeli negotiation teams with Jordan and the Palestinians from 1994 to 2001. For the past 16 months, Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been working tirelessly to broker a hostage-for-cease-fire deal aimed at ending the war and securing the return of Israeli captives. Their efforts have so far yielded only one breakthrough: a week-long pause in November 2023, during which 80 Israeli hostages and about two dozen others were freed in exchange for nearly 250 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed cautious optimism, stating that a deal was within reach. However, he acknowledged that it might only materialize after President Joe Biden leaves office under Donald Trump's administration. Speaking in Seoul, Blinken emphasized: 'We very much want to bring this over the finish line in the next two weeks,' adding that any agreement would align with Biden’s plan, which has garnered broad international support. Biden’s proposal calls for an end to the fighting in Gaza, where Israel has spent 16 months dismantling Hamas’ military infrastructure. The campaign followed the brutal October 7 massacre, during which over 6,000 Gazans – half of them armed terrorists – stormed into Israel, killing more than 1,200 people. Another 251 Israelis and foreign nationals were abducted and taken into Gaza. Today, 96 hostages remain, in addition to four Israelis captured and killed in earlier conflicts, including Lt. Hadar Goldin and 1st Sgt. Oren Shaul. The IDF estimates that at least a third of the remaining captives are dead. On Monday, a Saudi news agency leaked a list of hostages reportedly slated for release in the first phase of any agreement. The list included women, children, elderly individuals, and those in poor health. However, it was unclear which of the people on the list were alive or dead. The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) quickly clarified that the list, widely circulated in the media, had not been provided by Hamas. Instead, Israel originally shared it with mediators back in July 2024. 'As yet, Israel has not received any confirmation or comment from Hamas regarding the status of the hostages on the list,' the PMO stated. However, an Israeli source later told a local outlet that Hamas had indeed passed on a list of hostages. In addition, on Sunday, a Hamas official, speaking to Reuters, insisted that any agreement would still have to hinge on Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza and the establishment of a permanent cease-fire. The challenge, experts say, is that even if Hamas wanted to return all the hostages, it might not be able to. Gershon Baskin, director of the International Communities Organization Middle East and a negotiator involved in the 2011 release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit from Hamas captivity, is certain of this. 'I 500% believe Hamas doesn’t know where all the hostages are,' he said. 'There’s no reason to doubt that,' Baskin explained. 'Hamas controls very little of the Gaza Strip. Most of it – 80% of the buildings – has been bombed or destroyed. Thousands of Gazans are missing, buried under rubble, with their families having no idea where they are. The hostages are likely buried under the rubble as well.' Complicating matters, not all the hostages were taken by Hamas. Other terrorist organizations abducted some, while others were seized by civilians unaffiliated with any group. Since the IDF began operations in Gaza, Hamas’s central command has been dismantled. According to Baskin, the group now lacks any functional communication system – digital or analog – to coordinate with its members. Hamas itself admitted in September that it needed a week of cease-fire just to locate the hostages. Baskin believes this was no exaggeration. Tragically, he added, it’s highly probable that some hostages’ bodies will never be recovered, leaving their fates forever unknown. However, even if the hostages could be located, it is unlikely that Israel can or will agree to the terms Hamas would demand to release everyone: a total cease-fire and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip. Cristal explained that throughout the history of hostage negotiations, one golden rule was consistently followed: The release of Israeli hostages was always exchanged for Palestinian prisoners. 'It was always kept on the humanitarian level – purely people for people,' Cristal said. 'Any attempt to provide additional considerations – political considerations, like territory or any other consideration – was rejected by Israel.' This approach changed in February 2024 when the Biden administration linked the release of hostages to a cease-fire agreement, pressuring Israel to accept the plan. 'By linking the release of prisoners to the end of the war, you actually gave a structure of veto power to both [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and Hamas,' Cristal said. Ending the war completely is not in Israel’s national interest because Hamas remains a significant threat in both Gaza and the West Bank, despite Israel’s efforts to weaken it. Israel will, for a long time if not forever, need to maintain military pressure to deter the organization and protect its citizens. Cristal explained that tying hostage releases to a full cessation of hostilities ensures either that no deal will ever be reached or that Hamas will perpetually hold bodies or live hostages as bargaining chips to halt Israeli military action. 'That is the root of a bad deal – a really bad deal,' Cristal said. 'We will need to live with many, many Ron Arads, Goldins, and Shauls.' Ron Arad was an Israeli Air Force officer who disappeared during a mission over Lebanon in 1986 and is believed to have been captured by terrorists before being handed over to Hezbollah. Cristal argued that Israel could have secured the hostages' release through smaller, incremental deals. Critics of partial agreements say they are immoral because they leave some hostages behind. However, Cristal countered, 'I say, take out whoever you can, whenever you can. But that was not the paradigm' proposed by Biden and Blinken, he said. Instead, their approach has prolonged both the negotiations and the war. Now, with Donald Trump preparing to take office, the paradigm is shifting once again. On Monday night, Trump warned again that Hamas will 'have hell to pay' if it fails to release the hostages. In the Middle East, Trump is perceived as a strong leader, even in parts of the Arab world. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Gershon Baskin noted that the Biden administration never had significant leverage over Hamas and has not fully utilized the leverage it has over Israel. Trump, while also having minimal influence over Hamas, is expected to exert greater albeit covert pressure on Israel. Both Baskin and Cristal predict that Trump will push Israel to declare an end to the war in exchange for the release of most living hostages and some bodies. This outcome could be temporary and will likely leave some hostages behind. Cristal suggested that the intensification of negotiations is less about Hamas’ weakness or desire to end the war and more about the mounting pressure on Netanyahu. He may now feel compelled to finalize a deal that could be credited to Trump by or shortly after January 20. 'Netanyahu might be willing to make compromises that he wasn’t willing to make until now [for Trump],' Baskin explained. 'What’s different now from everything in the past few months is January 20.' 'The entrance of Trump might be what clinches a deal,' he concluded.

Wanted IDF soldier who escaped Brazil lands in Israel	Yuval Vagdani, a Nova massacre survivor, was wanted in Brazil after a complaint was filed against him for videos he posted from Gaza; He fled to Argentina, the U.S., and has now landed back in Israel Yuval Vagdani is an IDF soldier who was wanted in Brazil, from where he fled with the help of the Foreign Ministry after a complaint was filed against him for videos from the Gaza Strip that he posted online. On Wednesday, the family agreed to publish his name after he landed in Israel. After leaving Brazil he reached Argentina and continued to the U.S. before returning to Israel. 'We are all excited that he returned home safely,' said Itzik, Yuval's father, and thanked those involved who helped him reach Israel. Yuval is a survivor of the Nova massacre, and now that he has returned home, he has told his family that he will no longer upload videos from Gaza. 'He will never return to Brazil again,' said his father. 'He will learn from the mistakes he made. The main thing is that he has now returned to Israel and we are all happy that everything is behind us. The people of Israel live and are strong and we will prevail.' Brazil's federal court has ordered the local police to open an investigation against Vagdani, who arrived in the country with his friends on vacation after completing his military service about a week ago. Luckily, the he managed to leave Brazil with his friends before they were arrested. The judge's decision followed a complaint filed by the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF), which focuses on legal proceedings against IDF soldiers who, according to the foundation, 'committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in Palestine.' According to the foundation, named after a 6-year-old Palestinian girl who was allegedly killed by IDF fire during the war in the Gaza Strip, the Brazilian government decided to take action following a complaint it filed against Vagdani, who arrived in the country as a tourist. The foundation's complaint claimed his actions were part of a broader effort and constituted 'genocide and crimes against humanity' under international law. Among the evidence provided by the foundation were videos and photographs that allegedly show Vagdani planting explosives in November 2024 and taking part in the destruction of 'entire neighborhoods' in Gaza, which were reportedly used as shelters for Palestinians displaced from their homes. On Tuesday, local media in Brazil reported that the federal police had asked the court to reconsider its order to open a criminal investigation against Vagdani, claiming that the case required a more in-depth investigation before it could proceed to a real investigation. The background to this, as reported by the local news website Metrópoles, is a dispute among police officers over the legitimacy of such an investigation, and the request submitted for reconsideration of the decision stated that 'technical and legal issues' surrounding such a move needed to be resolved. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to the report, some investigators in the Brazilian police believe that an investigation into suspected war crimes against the soldier is legitimate due to the fact that Brazil is a signatory to the Rome Statute under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, while others there believe this is insufficient grounds and that it is necessary to rely on a local law that would define such an offense. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyarr9iuyl	2025-01-07T22:05:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/08/rk5SgcsL1l/rk5SgcsL1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Huge wild fires burn in Los Angeles, flames reach Hollywood actor...	Strong winds fan the flames in California, which also spread to an upscale neighborhood in Los Angeles; Residents spoke of 'crying and screaming' during the evacuation; The fire caused cancelation of premiere of Jennifer Lopez's new film, while James Woods filmed the flames shooting from his home: 'I don't know if the house is still standing' A wildfire whipped up by extreme winds swept through a Los Angeles hillside dotted with celebrity residences Tuesday, burning homes in Pacific Palisades and prompting evacuation orders for tens of thousands.

Gavin Newsom, who was in Southern California to attend the naming of a national monument by President Joe Biden, made a detour to the canyon to see 'firsthand the impact of these swirling winds and the embers,' and he said he found 'not a few of the many structures already destroyed.' Officials did not give an exact number of structures damaged or destroyed in the Pacific Palisades wildfire, but they said about 30,000 residents were under evacuation orders and more than 13,000 structures were under threat. And the worst could be yet to come. The blaze began around 10:30 a.m., shortly after the start of a Santa Ana windstorm that the National Weather service warned could be 'life threatening' and the strongest to hit Southern California in more than a decade. The exact cause of the fire was unknown and no injuries had been reported, officials said. Only about 25 miles (about 40 kilometers) northeast in Altadena, another fire spread to about 400 acres (about 162 hectares) by Tuesday evening, prompting evacuation orders, the Angeles National Forest posted on the social platform X. The winds were expected to increase overnight and continue for days, producing isolated gusts that could top 100 mph (160 kph) in mountains and foothills - including in areas that haven't seen substantial rain in months. 'By no stretch of the imagination are we out of the woods,' Newsom warned residents, saying the worst of the winds are expected between 10 p.m. Tuesday and 5 a.m. Wednesday. He declared a state of emergency on Tuesday. As of Tuesday evening, 28,300 households were without power due to the strong winds, according to the mayor's office. About 15,000 utility customers in Southern California had their power shut off to reduce the risk of equipment sparking a blaze. A half a million customers total were at risk of losing power preemptively. The Pacific Palisades fire quickly consumed about 4.6 square miles (11.6 square kilometers) of land in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in western Los Angeles, sending up a dramatic plume of smoke visible across the city. Residents in Venice Beach, some 6 miles (10 kilometers) away, reported seeing the flames. It was one of several blazes across the area. Sections of Interstate 10 and the scenic Pacific Coast Highway were closed to all non-essential traffic to aid in evacuation efforts. But other roads were blocked. Some residents jumped out of their vehicles to get out of danger and waited to be picked up. The LA Fire Department requested all off-duty members call with their availability for recall Tuesday evening. Resident Kelsey Trainor said the only road in and out of her neighborhood was completely blocked. Ash fell all around them while fires burned on both sides of the road. 'We looked across and the fire had jumped from one side of the road to the other side of the road,'Trainor said. 'People were getting out of the cars with their dogs and babies and bags, they were crying and screaming. The road was just blocked, like full-on blocked for an hour.' An Associated Press video journalist saw a roof and chimney of one home in flames and another residence where the walls were burning. The Pacific Palisades neighborhood, which borders Malibu about 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of downtown LA, includes hillside streets of tightly packed homes along winding roads nestled against the Santa Monica Mountains and stretches down to beaches along the Pacific Ocean. An AP photographer saw multi-million dollar mansions on fire as helicopters overhead dropped water loads. Roads were clogged in both directions as evacuees fled down toward the Pacific Coast Highway while others begged for rides back up to their homes to rescue pets. Two of the homes on fire were inside exclusive gated communities. Long-time Palisades resident Will Adams said he immediately went to pick his two kids up from St. Matthews Parish School when he heard the fire was nearby. Meanwhile, he said embers flew into his wife's car as she tried to evacuate. 'She vacated her car and left it running,' Adams said. She and many other residents walked down toward the ocean until it was safe. Adams said he had never witnessed anything like this in the 56 years he's lived there. He watched as the sky turned brown and then black as homes started burning. He could hear loud popping and bangs 'like small explosions,' which he said he believes were the transformers exploding. 'It is crazy, it's everywhere, in all the nooks and crannies of the Palisades. One home's safe, the other one's up in flames' Adams said. Actor James Woods posted footage of flames burning through bushes and past palm trees on a hill near his home. The towering orange flames billowed among the landscaped yards between the homes. 'Standing in my driveway, getting ready to evacuate,' Woods said in the short video on X. Actor Steve Guttenberg, who lives in the Pacific Palisades, urged people who abandoned their cars to leave their keys behind so they could be moved to make way for fire trucks. 'This is not a parking lot,' Guttenberg told KTLA. 'I have friends up there and they can't evacuate. I'm walking up there as far as I can moving cars.' The erratic weather caused Biden to cancel plans to travel to inland Riverside County, where he was to announce the establishment of two new national monuments in the state. He remained in Los Angeles, where smoke was visible from his hotel, and was briefed on the wildfires. The Federal Emergency Management Agency approved a grant to help reimburse California for the firefighting cost. Biden said in a statement that he and his team are communicating with state and local officials and he has offered 'any federal assistance that is needed to help suppress the terrible Pacific Palisades fire.'

The museum located on the eastern end of the Pacific Palisades is a separate campus of the world-famous Getty Museum that focuses on the art and culture of ancient Greece and Rome. The fire also burned Palisades Charter High School classrooms. Film studios canceled two movie premieres due to the fire and windy weather, including Jennifer Lopez's new film, and the Los Angeles Unified School District said it temporarily relocated students from three campuses in the Pacific Palisades area. Recent dry winds, including the notorious Santa Anas, have contributed to warmer-than-average temperatures in Southern California, where there's been very little rain so far this season. Southern California hasn't seen more than 0.1 inches (0.25 centimeters) of rain since early May. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjmt5tjikl	2025-01-07T20:48:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/08/HJkE00LjLkl/HJkE00LjLkl_0_48_800_451_0_small.jpg
Las Vegas Cybertruck suspect used ChatGPT to plan blast, police s...	The suspected driver of the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on New Year's Day used popular chatbot ChatGPT to plan the blast, officials told reporters on Tuesday. The suspect used ChatGPT to try and work out how much explosive was needed to trigger the blast, officials said. Authorities last week identified the person found dead inside the Cybertruck as Matthew Livelsberger, 37, an active-duty Army soldier from Colorado Springs, and said he acted alone. The FBI says the incident appeared to be a case of suicide. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said on Tuesday the Cybertruck blast was the first incident on U.S. soil where ChatGPT had been used to build an explosive device.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1oj00tj8kl	2025-01-07T20:11:03-08:00	
Iran tells France to review 'unconstructive' approach ahead of me...	Iran's foreign ministry called upon Paris to review its 'unconstructive' approach, a few days before Tehran is set to hold a new round of talks about its nuclear program with major European countries. On Monday, Emmanuel Macron said Tehran's uranium enrichment drive is nearing a point of no return and warned that European partners in a moribund 2015 nuclear deal with Iran should consider reimposing sanctions if no progress is reached. 'Untrue claims by a government that has itself refused to fulfil its obligations under the nuclear deal and has played a major role in (Israel's) acquisition of nuclear weapons is deceitful and projective,' Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei wrote on X on Wednesday. French, German and British diplomats are set to hold a follow-up meeting with Iranian counterparts on Jan. 13 after one in November held to discuss the possibility of serious negotiations in coming months to defuse tensions with Tehran, as Trump is due to return to the White House on Jan. 20.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry6jukslkl	2025-01-07T20:08:38-08:00	
IDF will stay in Lebanon until Hezbollah is dismantled'	Anywhere Hezbollah rebuilds, they will meet the Israeli army,' warns Brig.-Gen. Amir Avivi Israel is not relying on anyone but itself to ensure Hezbollah does not rebuild in Lebanon, according to Brig.-Gen. Amir Avivi, founder and chairman of HaBithonistim. 'Israel is not counting on anybody; Israel is counting on Israel,' he told ILTV on Tuesday when asked whether Israel would withdraw from Lebanon as the end of the 60-day ceasefire approaches. 'Anything that is not Israel will be a bonus. So, if we manage to deploy the Lebanese army, that's a bonus. If they manage to dismantle the positions of Hezbollah, that's a bonus. But more than 40 Hezbollah terrorists have been killed by Israel since the beginning of the ceasefire because they were trying to rebuild themselves. And this is not going to change—not only in south Lebanon, but all over Lebanon.' Avivi emphasized that Hezbollah will face consequences wherever it attempts to rebuild. 'Anywhere Hezbollah will try to rebuild itself, they will meet the Israeli army, and there will be retaliation,' he said. While the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah appears to be extending, Israel has not committed to removing its troops from Lebanon until Lebanon fulfills its obligations under the deal. Avivi clarified that the timeline is less important than the agreement's implementation. 'If the Lebanese army doesn't deploy fully, if they don't dismantle Hezbollah in south Lebanon, if they don't push Hezbollah out of south Lebanon, the IDF is going to stay in its positions and secure the citizens of Israel,' Avivi stressed. 'I think we learned that lesson from the seventh of October. We're not going to agree to timetables. We want to see results on the ground. And this is the responsibility of the state of Lebanon. This is the responsibility of the Lebanese army to do what was agreed upon—to dismantle Hezbollah, to push it out of south Lebanon, and to fully deploy the Lebanese army in a way that will create stability and security in Lebanon.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjxitdjl1l	2025-01-07T18:18:16-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/rJtNCrvbIJg/rJtNCrvbIJg_0_151_1601_901_0_small.jpg
Ancient Byzantine monastery unveiled	A 600-year-old monastery was discovered near Kiryat Gat with a remarkable mosaic floor A stunning monastery with a colorful mosaic floor, a Greek inscription, and a sophisticated winepress has been uncovered during an Israel Antiquities Authority excavation. The dig was conducted as part of the Israel Land Authority's development of the Karmey Gat North neighborhood near Kiryat Gat. 'This is the largest and most significant site discovered in the region from the Roman and Byzantine periods,' researchers noted. The monastery, dated to the Byzantine period (5th–6th centuries CE), is part of a site that originated during the Roman era and remained active for around 600 years. Its mosaic floor features intricate designs, including crosses, lions, doves, flowers, geometric patterns, and a quote from Deuteronomy: 'Blessed are you when you come in, and blessed are you when you go out.' The excavation also revealed a highly sophisticated winepress, used and repaired over centuries. Its fermentation rooms and collecting vat are decorated with mosaics made from blue and white stones. To preserve this extraordinary find, the mosaic floor will be relocated to a public area in the city, where it will be accessible to visitors.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjqctdslyl	2025-01-07T18:02:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/08/rkPw5wjI1e/rkPw5wjI1e_0_166_1440_811_0_small.jpg
Israel prepares for Trump's return and for a joint attack on Iran...	IDF and US military generals meet in Israeli ahead of Trump's inauguration to discuss frozen US weapons shipment and potentially plan an attack on Iran, which is dramatically close to nuclear capability The deputy commander of the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, landed in Israel last week for a visit and met with the deputy chief of staff, Major General Amir Baram. The parties discussed shipments of critical weapons that the outgoing Biden administration has delayed and improving readiness for a possible joint attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. The IDF Spokesperson reported that Baram and Cooper visited a number of Israeli Air Force bases, where a review of joint operational operations took place. 'In addition, a joint discussion was held regarding the threats from Yemen and cooperation with the U.S. military,' the IDF spokesman reported. Trump did not rule out the possibility that he would order an attack against Iran's nuclear facilities or support such an attack by Israel. At a press conference about three weeks ago, the president-elect was asked about a possible preemptive strike against Iranian nuclear facilities, amid reports that his team was considering such a step, and replied that he does not rule out any action. Tehran is preparing for Trump's return to the White House, and amid Israeli threats, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi declared about two weeks ago that '2025 will be an important year in terms of the Iranian nuclear issue.' Araghchi made the remarks after a meeting with his Chinese counterpart in Beijing. He did not mention Donald Trump or elaborate on the significance of 2025. It is possible that his remarks were related to Trump's return, and Iranian fears that his entry into the White House would strengthen Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to the latest quarterly report published by the IAEA in November, Iran has already accumulated a fairly significant amount of 60% enriched uranium, an amount that is enough for four nuclear bombs. According to the report, as of October 26, the amount of uranium enriched to this level stands at 182.3 kg – an increase of 17.6 kg since August. In order for uranium to be used to produce nuclear weapons, it must be enriched to a level of 90%, but nuclear scientists explain that the path from 60% to 90% is quite short and is considered a 'technical' step which can be done in a few days or weeks. Israel and the U.S. are discussing the Biden Administration's delayed weapons shipment, which includes 1,700 heavy bombs, 134 D9 Caterpillar bulldozers, and additional weapons. The IDF is already preparing to target Iran's nuclear facilities by improving readiness for a possible joint attack with the U.S. The use of these bulldozers by the IDF led to major internal criticism in the U.S., protests and tremendous pressure on the Biden administration which gave in and froze the shipment. An examination conducted by Ynet in November revealed that dozens of IDF D9 bulldozers require maintenance. These bulldozers were also needed in southern Lebanon. 'At the height of the fighting in Gaza, about a year ago, battalion commanders 'fought' over D9 bulldozers, making it necessary to carry out maintenance on them,' said an IDF commander in November. It is difficult to officially and directly link the deadly results of the raid in Jabaliya in October and November, and the 21 fighters killed in about a month, many from IEDs, to the dire need for D9 bulldozers. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In these operations, the bulldozers are usually the first to lead the combat teams, safely clearing 'dirty' areas from explosives that are set to explode and harm infantry and armored soldiers. At the same time, it is clear this tool is not only operationally effective against tunnels and in built-up areas, but also protects soldiers' lives. The US is still freezing a shipment of about 1,300 bombs for the Israeli Air Force, which the defense establishment has already purchased from Boeing - in shekels and not in aid dollars - weighing close to a ton per bomb, on the similar claim that the IDF could harm the civilian Gazan population with them. Half of this shipment, which was frozen about six months ago by the administration and caused a stir, has reached the IDF, but about half is still stuck in warehouses in the U.S. In addition, the defense establishment currently rents engineering tools for forces in the field from private contractors. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1d00f7o8jx	2025-01-07T14:02:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/ryeWfliLJe/ryeWfliLJe_0_0_853_488_0_small.jpg

Probe of New York Mayor Eric Adams uncovers more criminal conduct...	Federal prosecutors said on Tuesday they have uncovered additional criminal conduct by Eric Adams as they prepare for the New York City mayor's April corruption trial. Adams, 64, was charged in September with accepting travel perks from Turkish officials and political donations from foreigners in exchange for taking actions to benefit Turkey. He pleaded not guilty to charges of bribery, fraud and solicitation of a campaign contribution from a foreign national. In a court filing, the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan cited new information in urging U.S. District Judge Dale Ho to deny Adams' request that they identify his alleged co-conspirators or provide early access to evidence for his April 21 trial. The prosecutors warned doing so could lead to attempts to tamper with witnesses. Prosecutors said in a court hearing in October that a superseding indictment in the case was 'quite likely.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjjotqoujl	2025-01-07T13:41:58-08:00	
Hamas exploits chaos in Syria, looks for Jewish targets around th...	While Hamas struggles to control Gaza, an Israeli senior official warns there is growing concern regarding the terror organization's attempts to carry out attacks against Israeli, Jewish targets abroad The war in Gaza has been going on for 15 months and the terrorist organizations are struggling to maintain their control. An Israeli senior official explained on Tuesday that Hamas is frustrated with the situation and is seeking achievements elsewhere. Israel is increasingly concerned about attempts by Hamas and Islamic Jihad to carry out terrorist attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets abroad. Alongside this threat, Israel is also seeing an increase in terrorism in the West Bank, directed and financed by Iran, which is smuggling large quantities of weapons into the West Bank through Jordan. Meanwhile, Israel is following with concern the 'establishment' of Hamas and Islamic Jihad members in Syria, who are taking advantage of the chaos created following the rebel-led coup and the fall of the Assad regime. Currently, there are approximately 2,000 Hamas members and approximately 7,000 Islamic Jihad members. Amid international criticism of the IDF's presence in the buffer zone between the countries, Israel fears that terrorist organizations will try to carry out terrorist attacks in the Golan Heights. The senior official explained that Israel does not have direct communication with the new Syrian leaders, but there is a backchannel for sending messages. In Israel, people are unimpressed by rebel leader Al-Julani's 'moderate messages,' saying they are focused on stabilizing the country. Do not be fooled. After they stabilize Syria, they will look at Israel. A global terrorist effort, without leaders While Israel fights Hamas in Gaza, several terror attacks against Israeli targets have been thwarted. The terrorist organizations, which draw inspiration from Iran, seek to harm Israeli and Jewish individuals, embassies and other Jewish assets. In January 2024, the Mossad and the Shin Bet revealed the identities of Hamas operatives in several European countries, following an arrest operation that took place a month earlier. On December 14, 2023, security and enforcement authorities in Denmark and Germany announced the arrest of suspects throughout Europe, who have since been prosecuted. The suspects were working for Hamas to attack Israeli, Jewish and Western targets. It was also reported at the time that the Mossad and Shin Bet had thwarted a Hamas attack in Denmark. A joint statement by the Prime Minister's Office, the Mossad, and the Shin Bet in January 2024 stated that a comprehensive picture of Hamas' terrorist activity has been revealed, including details about Hamas infrastructure, operatives and targets. It was also revealed that Hamas had purchased drones and activated criminal organizations in Europe to attack Israelis and Jews. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamas draws inspiration from the terrorist attacks carried out by the Iranian regime, and similar to the IGRC, it strives to hit Israeli, Jewish and Western targets at all costs.

Los Angeles wildfire prompts evacuations amid extreme winds	A wildfire burned about 200 acres (80 hectares) and threatened homes in an upscale section of Los Angeles on Tuesday, forcing evacuations after officials had already warned of extreme fire danger from dry, powerful winds. The Pacific Palisades fire between Santa Monica and Malibu led the Los Angeles Fire Department to issue a mandatory evacuation order for a large area from the hills of Topanga Canyon down to the coastline. 'Immediate threat to life. This is a lawful order to LEAVE NOW,' read one notice posted by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). Los Angeles Fire Department Captain Erik Scott urged against complacency because of cool winter weather, warning of 'explosive wildfire behavior' in a public service message.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by8h11ms81g	2025-01-07T12:49:57-08:00	
US shifts some military aid to Lebanon from Egypt, letter says	-US shifts some military aid to Lebanon from Egypt, letter says * Shift comes as Lebanon faces shift in Syria, enforces ceasefire U.S. President Joe Biden's administration will divert $95 million in military aid allocated for Egypt to Lebanon, which faces threats from Hezbollah and other non-state actors and is enforcing a cease-fire with Israel, according to a document seen by Reuters on Monday. The State Department notification to Congress of the planned shift calls the Lebanese armed forces 'a key partner' in upholding the Nov. 27, 2024, Israel-Lebanon agreement to cease hostilities and to prevent Hezbollah from threatening Israel. The move comes after some of Biden's fellow Democrats in Congress expressed deep concerns about Egypt's human rights record, particularly the arrests of thousands of political prisoners. In response to questions about the reprogrammed funding, a State Department spokesperson said the department was still moving forward with foreign military financing for Egypt and said the assessment that Cairo had made progress on political prisoners had not changed. In September, State said the Biden administration was overriding human rights conditions on military aid to Egypt, granting Cairo its full allocation of $1.3 billion, including $95 million tied specifically to Egypt's progress on the release of political prisoners. According to the State Department document, the funds would be made available to professionalize the Lebanese Armed Forces, strengthen border security, combat terrorism and address security requirements affected by the shift in power in Syria. 'The United States remains Lebanon's security partner of choice, and U.S. support to the LAF directly helps secure Lebanon and the wider Levant region,' the notification said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkkn9molje	2025-01-07T12:20:30-08:00

Incoming U.S. Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff says there is a lot of great progress and he is 'really hopeful that by the inaugural, we'll have some good things to announce'; IDF chief issues stern warnings to Hamas of relentless pressure until all hostages are freed Incoming U.S. Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff has announced plans to travel to Doha later this week to advance ongoing hostage negotiations. Witkoff stated Tuesday that a deal is nearing completion and emphasized that President-elect Donald Trump expects the agreement to be finalized before his January 20 inauguration, warning that 'all hell will break loose' in the region if it is not. 'We’re making a lot of progress, and I don’t want to say too much because I think they’re doing a really good job back in Doha. I’m leaving tomorrow to go back to Doha, but I think that we’ve had some really great progress, and I’m really hopeful that by the inaugural, we’ll have some good things to announce on behalf of the president,' Witkoff said during a press conference Tuesday at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. Trump joined the event briefly to provide an update on the talks. 'We’re working in tandem in a really good way, but it’s the president, his reputation, the things that he has said, that are driving this negotiation, and so hopefully it’ll all work out and we’ll save some lives,' Witkoff added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Pressed about the reasons for the delays in reaching an agreement, Witkoff refrained from detailing specifics. 'I believe we’ve been on the verge of [a deal]. I don’t want to discuss what’s delayed it — no point to be negative in any way,' he said. When asked if the parties were waiting for Trump to take office before finalizing the deal, Witkoff dismissed the suggestion. 'No, I think they heard him loud and clear. [This] better get done by the inaugural,' he said. Meanwhile, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi issued a stern warning to Hamas leaders during a visit to the Jabaliya area in Gaza, vowing relentless pressure until all Israeli hostages are released. 'We will not stop. We will bring them to the point where they understand they must return all the hostages,' Halevi declared during a briefing with commanders in the field. Speaking during an operational assessment in Gaza, Halevi emphasized the toll IDF operations are taking on Hamas. 'I want you to know, as I look at Hamas’ situation, they see daily what you are doing to them, and they understand this is nearing the point of being unbearable,' he said. The chief of staff praised the professionalism of IDF forces and underscored the determination to continue the mission. 'We will not stop. We will bring them to the realization that they must return all the hostages. Otherwise, the highly professional work you are doing will continue, resulting in more prisoners and more dead operatives. I know you are doing everything to minimize casualties on our side,' he added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjuzczoi1e	2025-01-07T11:54:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/SJgRoT1iLyx/SJgRoT1iLyx_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Man accused of killing woman in New York subway fire pleads not g...	The man accused of killing a woman sleeping on a New York City subway car by setting her on fire after what prosecutors say was a night of heavy drinking pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and arson at a court hearing on Tuesday. A grand jury has indicted Sebastian Zapeta, 33, of one count of first-degree murder, three counts of second-degree murder and one count of first-degree arson in the first degree for the killing of Debrina Kawam, 57. After his arrest, Zapeta told detectives that he often drinks heavily to the point of blacking out, and that he had done so just before Kawam was killed, according to a court filing by prosecutors on Tuesday. Many were horrified by a brief video of Kawam engulfed in flames near the open doors of a train car, recorded by a bystander on the platform. According to the police account, Zapeta used a lighter to ignite the clothes of Kawam, who appeared to be sleeping on a seat in a stationary F train car at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue subway station at about 7:30 a.m. on Dec. 22. He then used a shirt to fan the fire, the police complaint said. Kawam was pronounced dead at the scene. When police detectives showed Zapeta video of Kawam being set on fire, he told them that it was him in the video, but he did not recognize Kawam nor remembered it happening, according to the court filing by the Brooklyn district attorney's office.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjrki11ilje	2025-01-07T11:15:21-08:00	
Turkey says it will mount offensive against Kurdish YPG if demand...	Turkey will carry out a cross-border offensive into northeastern Syria against the Kurdish YPG militia if the group does not meet Ankara's demands, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said on Tuesday, while adding that Syria's new rulers must address the issue. Turkey considers the YPG, which spearheads the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), as a terrorist group linked to Kurdish militants waging a decades-old insurgency against the Turkish state. While repeatedly asking its NATO ally Washington to halt its support for the group, Ankara has carried out several incursions against the YPG in the past and controls swathes of territory in northern Syria. Since the ousting of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad last month by rebels, some of whom Turkey has supported, Ankara has demanded that the YPG disband, its non-Syrian militants and foreign terrorist fighters leave Syria or are repatriated to their source countries, and its leaders turn themselves in. Speaking to broadcaster CNN Turk, Fidan said Turkey believed the new Syrian administration must address the issue of the YPG's presence, but added this may take time as a transition period is underway in Damascus. Asked what Turkey would do if Damascus was unable to address the issue, Fidan said 'whatever is necessary'. When asked what that entailed, he said 'a military operation', while adding that the new Syrian leadership had the power to battle the YPG on its own as well.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syoh5zilkx	2025-01-07T11:11:47-08:00	
British minister says Musk knows 'absolutely nothing' about child...	A British minister who Elon Musk has described as a 'rape genocide apologist' said on Tuesday the U.S. billionaire knew 'absolutely nothing' about the child sexual abuse scandals he has recently been commenting on. Musk, an ally of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, has spent days posting messages on his social media site X accusing Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer of failing to prosecute gangs of men who raped young girls when Starmer was director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013. Musk has also attacked Starmer's safeguarding minister Jess Phillips, describing her as a 'rape genocide apologist' who should be in jail. Phillips has spent much of her career working with victims of domestic violence, sexual violence and human trafficking. Musk and opposition politicians have called for a new national inquiry into the scandals after Phillips told the council of a town where sex abuse cases were reported that it should hold its own investigation. Speaking to broadcaster ITV, Phillips said Musk's comments, which she described as 'ridiculous,' turned her 'world upside down.' Responding to Starmer's criticism, Musk said on X the prime minister was 'deeply complicit in the mass rapes in exchange for votes', adding: 'That's what the inquiry would show.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syinybsujx	2025-01-07T11:10:24-08:00	
Folk singer Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary dies at 86	American singer and songwriter Peter Yarrow, who found fame with the 1960s folk music trio Peter, Paul and Mary, died on Tuesday at the age of 86, his publicist said. Yarrow died in the morning at his New York home surrounded by family following a four-year battle with bladder cancer, publicist Ken Sunshine said in a statement. 'Our fearless dragon is tired and has entered the last chapter of his magnificent life,' Yarrow's daughter Bethany said in a statement provided by Sunshine.

Foreign minister Gideon Sa’ar visits Abu Dhabi in first since sta...	The visit, kept under wraps until the start of the meeting, marks the first by an Israeli foreign minister to the UAE since the war began and comes in shadow of reports of behind-the-scenes talks on the Gaza Strip, in which the Emirates were involved; The two ministers are expected to discuss 'regional developments and bilateral relations' Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar met with his Emirati counterpart, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday evening. The meeting, kept under wraps until it started, marks the second public visit by an Israeli minister to the UAE since the onset of the war and the first by a foreign minister. It follows a series of high-level secret meetings by Israeli officials during the war. The two ministers are currently meeting at a palace in Abu Dhabi, just hours after Reuters reported on behind-the-scenes talks involving the UAE and the United States about managing Gaza in the aftermath of the war. According to the report, the UAE and other nations, alongside the U.S., are considering a temporary governance role in Gaza until a reformed and 'strengthened' Palestinian Authority can assume control. In a statement, Sa’ar’s office confirmed his visit was at the invitation of Sheikh Abdullah, adding that the discussions are focused on 'regional developments and bilateral relations between the two countries.' The UAE’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying that 'Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan met with Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar. During the meeting, the two discussed regional developments, particularly the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and international efforts to secure a stable cease-fire.' Conditions for post-war Gaza governance The Reuters report, based on conversations with 12 diplomats and Western officials, outlines a proposal for temporary governance of Gaza involving the UAE, the U.S., and other nations. This governance would address administrative, security and reconstruction efforts until control could be transferred to a reformed Palestinian Authority. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has strongly opposed such plans, the report suggests the UAE, due to its peace agreement with Israel, holds a degree of influence over his government. However, officials noted that neither Israel nor the international community has presented a clear vision for Gaza’s future. The ideas emerging from Abu Dhabi are still in preliminary stages, lacking formal endorsement or detailed frameworks. The UAE’s vision, as conveyed by officials, includes a reformed Palestinian Authority leading Gaza, with the long-term goal of establishing an independent Palestinian state encompassing the West Bank and East Jerusalem—a prospect Netanyahu is unlikely to support. A senior Emirati official emphasized that participation in any post-war Gaza plan would hinge on conditions tied to Palestinian statehood. 'The UAE will not join any initiative that does not include substantial reforms to the Palestinian Authority, its empowerment, and a credible roadmap toward a Palestinian state,' the official said. 'These elements – currently absent – are critical for the success of any post-war plan for Gaza.' As discussions continue, the path to stabilizing Gaza and rebuilding its governance remains fraught with challenges, underscoring the complexities of forging a sustainable solution for the region. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjspmeji1x	2025-01-07T10:52:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/ByNXgyiLke/ByNXgyiLke_1_81_1068_601_0_small.jpg

Israel says no foreign courts have warrants issued against reserv...	Israel said on Tuesday pressure groups were pushing foreign courts to take action against Israelis over alleged war crimes in Gaza but described the actions as 'propaganda activity' and said no warrants had been issued. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri, over alleged war crimes in Gaza. The warrants sparked outrage in Israel but also drew fears that similar warrants could be issued against Israelis who served in the military in Gaza. On Sunday, an Israeli reservist on holiday in Brazil left the country after a Brazilian federal judge in Salvador ordered police to open an investigation into allegations that he had committed war crimes while serving with the military in Gaza. The Hind Rajab Foundation, the pro-Palestinian group which brought the action, said it had filed evidence of alleged war crimes with the ICC against 1,000 Israelis, including video and audio reports, forensic reports and other documentation. The ICC confirmed it had received a filing and said it would 'analyze the materials submitted, as appropriate'. Israel's foreign ministry offered assistance to the reservist singled out by the action but officials said the issue was not widespread. The military has warned reservists that they could face arrest abroad over alleged war crimes in Gaza, according to documents published by Israeli media.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sybeuxo8yl	2025-01-07T09:55:24-08:00

Danny Danon says other countries should fight the Houthis alongsi...	Danon, Israel's UN ambassador, says he constantly reminds the international body that Israel is in Gaza because 'we have no choice' and 'We will do whatever we have to do to bring all of the hostages back to Israel' As Trump's inauguration nears, Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, talks with Ynetnews about Israel's most pressing issues, including Iran, the Houthis, the hostages and Israel's relations with the U.S. Last week you asked for an urgent session of the UN Security Council to address the Houthi attacks against Israel. Any decisions or measures were taken in the council regarding this hostility? 'Well first I would like to thank the United States for calling for this session in the Security Council. In the debate, I told my colleagues there is no reason for the attacks from Yemen against Israel. We have no border with Yemen. We have no disputes with Yemen, and still they are sending ballistic missiles. Even my own school in my own hometown was destroyed completely from a ballistic missile coming from Yemen. I was very happy to hear the words of the U.S. ambassador and the UK ambassador. It's not only our responsibility to fight this radical organization. We expect other countries to take part in this fight.' Iran has denied any relations with the Houthis. Did Israel submit any documents or evidence that will expose this link? 'Absolutely. You know, they can deny it day and night, but when you look at the missiles, the UAVs, the technology, you understand it's all made in Iran. It's all funded by Iran. They cannot lie to the world. Everybody knows that Iran is behind the Houthis, and I think we should demand that Iran stop funding this organization.' Let's talk about the hostage deal. Are we close to bringing our 100 hostages home? 'We definitely hope so. I can tell you that both President Biden and President Trump are eager to see some development before January 20, before the inauguration of the new president. It's two weeks ahead. There's a lot of negotiations, and I hope we will hear good news, you know, we are praying for that.' Could you tell us about the special report document you have issued gathering the testimonies of the hostages that returned from Gaza? 'When you read this report and you understand what's happening in Gaza, the atrocities, you know, the tortures, the sexual abuse, starvation, you know, one cannot understand how the hostages are staying alive over there. We are praying for them, but we demand from the world not to be quiet. You know, at the UN, they always speak with me about the humanitarian aspects of the Palestinians in Gaza. What about our humanitarian rights? What about the hostages? I think it's a very important report, and we will distribute it to everywhere in the UN.' Do you feel the impact? I mean, was anyone who was exposed to the atrocities moved or changed his view? 'Absolutely, and we also bring a lot of families of hostages to the Security Council, to the General Assembly, you know, once they come and they interact with the ambassadors, you cannot sit idly by when you hear what they are going through. So we will continue to speak up and we will remind the world that we are in Gaza not because we want to be there. We are in Gaza because we have no choice. We will do whatever we have to do to bring all of the hostages back to Israel.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Security Council also heard family members of hostages who are still in captivity. Did it generate any reaction? 'Yes, you know, for the first time we were able to bring a family member to speak in the Security Council. You know, I think everybody will be moved from his words and no one can sit quietly when he sees a family member calling for the Security Council to take action and to bring his family members back home.' Where are we standing in the fight against and the efforts to close their activity in Gaza? 'So the law that passed the Knesset will be effective by the end of January, and we tell our colleagues at the UN we are willing to work with other UN organs and not with UNWA. It's about time to speak about that and to think about alternatives for UNRWA.' Last but not least, almost two weeks to the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Big hopes? 'Definitely when we see the people who nominated for different positions, Sharon: Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Ambassador Eli Stefanik to the UN, and here in Israel, Ambassador Mike Huckabee, they're all good friends of Israel, very knowledgeable, and we are looking forward to work with all of them.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkekuys8jg	2025-01-07T09:49:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/18/ryj4gqxB1x/ryj4gqxB1x_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
IDF and Palestinian Authority crack down on West Bank Palestinian...	IDF forces kill terrorists and arrest 18 suspects - and a reserve soldier is seriously injured - in the operation less than a day after the deadly attack near Kedumim in the northern West Bank IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari announced Tuesday that a reserve soldier was seriously injured during an operation in the Jordan Valley. 'The soldier was taken to the hospital, and his family has been informed,' the IDF said. The exchange of fire took place in the Palestinian village of Taluza, east of Nablus, and according to the IDF the forces killed a terrorist there in a close range fight. Also, two armed terrorists were eliminated who opened fire on the soldiers. During the operation, the security forces confiscated a large number of weapons, including AK-47 rifles, and arrested 18 suspects. The operation follows Monday's shooting attack near Kedumim, in which police officer Master Sgt. Elad Yaakov Winkelstein, 35; Rachel Cohen, 70; and Aliza Reiss, 73, were murdered. Defense Minister Israel Katz arrived at the scene of the attack on Tuesday and met the civilian who neutralized the threat. Katz also held a situation assessment in the Ephraim Brigade with senior IDF commanders. 'The despicable murderous attack that occurred here yesterday is an act of war in every sense of the word, and will be responded to accordingly,' the defense minister said. 'I have instructed the IDF to bolster forces in the West Bank. We will act forcefully against the perpetrators and those who sheltered them. We will not tolerate Palestinian terrorism,' Katz said. This operation joins a long-running counter-terrorism operation in the West Bank. In addition to the IDF, the Palestinian Authority's security forces also are operating against terrorism in the West Bank over the past month. The Palestinian security forces are operating against the terrorists in the Jenin Battalion, and during the operation six Palestinian security personnel were killed in action. On Monday, senior Palestinian Authority officials met with the head of Palestinian Intelligence, Minister Majed Faraj, and decided to continue the operation. 'The PA security forces will continue their activities in Jenin and will not announce the cessation of the operation. So far, about 700 lawbreakers and terrorists have been arrested,' they said. 'Most of the members of the Jenin Battalion fled the camp, the forces are arrested them everywhere,' a senior Palestinian security source said. According to the Palestinians, the operation led to the siege of the Jenin refugee camp, and caused power and water outages, along with obstructing the arrival of ambulances. In addition, they claimed that some of the houses were converted into military sites, which led to the displacement of residents. Meanwhile, Palestinian security mechanisms continue to operate throughout the West Bank. In the operation in Atil, north of Tulkarm, three Palestinians were injured by gunfire. One of the injured suspects is the released prisoner Yousef Mahana, one of the founders of the Tulkarm Battalion belonging to Islamic Jihad.

This is media propaganda that serves the extremist ministers to garner more votes from Israelis who are angry about the attacks.' Following the deadly attack in Kedumim, Smotrich met with West Bank officials. At the meeting, the minister said that the next cabinet meeting will deal with steps to eradicate terrorism in the West Bank. 'In Judea and Samaria, as in other arenas, we must move from defense to offense and launch extensive operations inside the terrorist nests until the weapons and terrorists are completely destroyed,' said Smotrich. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by0amcql1x	2025-01-07T09:37:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/BJ11vUyO5Lkl/BJ11vUyO5Lkl_8_49_1481_834_270_small.jpg
The Houthis have established a quasi-state in Yemen, modeled afte...	Decades of war have fractured Yemen, creating a dire humanitarian crisis and enabling the Houthis to assert themselves as a key regional force Yemen, once known as 'Arabia Felix' ('fortunate Arabia') for its cultural wealth and strategic location, now symbolizes the devastation wrought by prolonged war and division. The north remains firmly under the control of the Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, a group rooted in Yemen’s Zaydi Shiite minority that has established a quasi-state. Italian journalist Laura Silvia Battaglia, who has extensive experience in Yemen, says that the situation in Yemen 'is much worse than five years ago.' 'The Houthis have modeled their governance on Iran and Hezbollah, repurposing state structures to consolidate power over the past decade,' she explains. Hussein, a Yemeni journalist from Sanaa, agrees. 'The Houthis have built a self-sustaining financial system by exploiting the Yemeni population for over a decade. So even if the regime in Iran will fall, they will manage to survive anyhow and have clearly nothing to lose,' he says. The Houthis’ military actions, including recent missile attacks on Israel, align with Iran’s ideological vision of a Middle East without Israel, but do not appear to be directly coordinated. 'Their actions demonstrate alignment with Iran but also highlight their independent strategy. They have shown that they are not only an autonomous local actor but a regional one,' Battaglia said. Iran’s role in Yemen is significant but more complex than commonly depicted. While Tehran offers strategic and military support, the Houthis maintain high autonomy. Their financial resources are not solely dependent on Iran but are bolstered by an internal apparatus. 'The Houthis align with Iran’s broader geopolitical goals but have built their own funding streams through internal exploitation and international investments,' Battaglia said. 'Even before their attacks on Israel and gaining international recognition, they managed to terrorize and subsequently force a political dialogue with Saudi Arabia and the Emirates. Especially now, with other militias weakened, they have clearly positioned themselves as the most active and potentially dangerous militia in the region.' Despite their strength, the Houthis’ control has not garnered widespread public support. 'The population remains divided. Some admire their defiance, while others resent their exploitation and authoritarian control,' Battaglia explains. 'They’ve also built a Stasi-like control apparatus that surveils citizens and enforces loyalty to their regime, ensuring internal dissent remains minimal,' she adds, referring to the secret police of former East Germany known for their extensive surveillance and repression. The militia has proven to be a formidable force, particularly following the outbreak of the war between Israel and Hamas in 2023. Its actions have gone beyond aligning with the 'axis of resistance' to counter Israel, extending to disrupting international trade by damaging and halting ships in the Red Sea. 'They’ve been underestimated for years and considered to be only rebels in ‘slippers’ with Kalashnikovs, but their engineering skills and ability to repurpose drones and missiles demonstrate significant military capacity,' according to Battaglia. Hussein details the group’s ascent. 'They seized Saleh-era military assets, including weapons stockpiles and intelligence resources,' he says. And their rhetoric, which opposes U.S. and Israeli policies while supporting Gaza, has garnered them regional sympathy. 'They gain popular support by positioning themselves as defenders of major causes,' Hussein explains. Yemen’s dire humanitarian crisis is further exacerbated by deep political divisions. In the south, a fragile government supported by Saudi Arabia and the UAE struggles to maintain stability. 'The central government is heavily influenced by external powers, and its authority is fragmented by tribal and militant factions, but it is the only alternative to fight back the Houthis in the country,' according to Hussein. Battaglia adds that the central government, located in the south, is not a 'puppet.' However, she says, 'it strictly follows the directives of Arab nations, particularly the UAE, which has taken military and naval control of Aden’s coasts and city.' Over a decade of civil conflict has plunged the country into what the UN describes as the worst humanitarian crisis of the 21st century. Over 80% of Yemen’s 30 million people rely on humanitarian aid, but global support remains inconsistent and underfunded. In Al Hudaydah’s overstretched public hospital, staff serve over 2,000 patients daily. Funding from the World Health Organization barely covers fuel costs for six months. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hussein shared his sense of despair. 'Living conditions have significantly deteriorated because of the no-war, no-peace status the country has reached,' he says, noting that aid to Yemen has sharply declined as resources are being redirected to other global crises, such as the conflict in Ukraine, leaving Yemen further marginalized on the international stage. 'For example, Coca-Cola trucks entering from Oman face up to 50 checkpoints, with each checkpoint demanding a fee. The leadership also invests its profits internationally, with some Houthis owning businesses and assets in Dubai, China, and Russia. These investments sustain their operations and influence.' Yemen’s future hangs in the balance as its divisions grow deeper each year. Hussein expressed a glimmer of hope, saying: 'We can only hope that Yemen overcomes this ordeal, that peace prevails, and that the war ends.' Battaglia, however, paints a bleaker picture: 'Unifying Yemen into a single nation seems impossible now. The entrenched divisions and external influences have fractured the country beyond repair.' Both stress that without swift international intervention and meaningful action, Yemen risks becoming an enduring battleground for regional and global powers, with its people continuing to suffer the devastating consequences.

At least 901 people were executed by hanging last year in the Islamic Republic compared with 853 in 2023, UN human rights office says in report The number of people executed in Iran rose to 901 last year, including 31 women, some of whom were convicted of murdering their husbands after suffering abuse or being forced into marriage, theU N Human Rights Office reported on Tuesday. Most of the executions were for drug-related offenses, but political dissidents and people connected with mass protests in 2022 over the death in police custody of a 22-year-old woman were also among the victims, the UN statement said. 'It is deeply disturbing that yet again we see an increase in the number of people subjected to the death penalty in Iran year-on-year,' United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in a statement sent to journalists. 'It is high time Iran stemmed this ever-swelling tide of executions.' In total, at least 901 people were executed by hanging last year in the Islamic Republic, compared with 853 in 2023, the UN rights office said. This represents the highest number since 2015, when 972 people were executed. The 2022 protests, which sparked some of the worst turmoil since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, followed the death in police custody of Kurdish Iranian woman Mahsa Amini, who was arrested for allegedly flouting Iran's mandatory dress code. At least 31 women were executed in 2024, UN rights office spokesperson Liz Throssell told reporters at a Geneva press briefing, representing what she said was the highest number in at least 15 years. 'The majority of cases involved charges of murder. A significant number of the women were victims of domestic violence, child marriage or forced marriage,' she added.

Farewell to terror victim Rachel Cohen, as evil strikes again	A terrorist carried out a brutal massacre on Passover in 2002 in the home of my dear friends, the Gavish family, in Elon Moreh; In the aftermath of the tragedy, Rachel Cohen opened her home and her heart to the surviving children - yesterday she was murdered by terrorists I witnessed firsthand the boundless kindness of Rachel Cohen, a woman whose deeds of compassion made her a legend in her own lifetime - which ended on Monday at the hands of a terrorist. On that horrific night – Passover Eve 2002 – after a terrorist massacred my dear friends, the Gavish family, in Elon Moreh, Rachel Cohen opened her home to the survivors. The terrorists entered the Gavish home, firing indiscriminately, killing Rachel and David Gavish; their eldest son Avraham, a revered commander in the Sayeret Matkal; and their grandfather Yitzhak Kanner. Rachel Cohen was Rachel Gavish's closest friend. When the surviving Gavish children escaped the carnage – some climbing barefoot down a ladder from the second-floor windows while the terrorist continued his rampage – they found refuge in Rachel Cohen's home. I remember them gathered that night in her bedroom, stunned and grappling with the unthinkable task of deciding where to bury their parents, brother and grandfather, who had celebrated the Seder with them just a day earlier in that very home. During the shiva, as the family sat in their bullet-riddled living room, the Gavish children made a heartbreaking decision to leave Elon Moreh and relocate to Kedumim. How could they remain in a house that had become the site of such devastation? Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Rachel Cohen made her own decision at that moment: She left her meticulously kept home in Elon Moreh and moved to Kedumim to stay close to the Gavish children. While the Gavish family rented a home of their own, Rachel moved into a nearby house, always watching over them. Over the years, I saw her at their celebrations and memorials, steadfast in her role as a surrogate guardian. She stood by their side at weddings, as the children walked to the chuppah, and at every memorial, overlooking the graves of their loved ones. For 22 years, Rachel never wavered in her devotion. She remained an enduring presence, ensuring the Gavish children knew they were never alone. When I heard the news of a woman named Rachel Cohen murdered in a recent terror attack in Kedumim, I couldn’t believe it might be her. 'Rachel Cohen' is a common name, I told myself. There’s no way someone so dedicated to protecting her friend’s six orphaned children could meet such a fate. But when I messaged Yeshurun Gavish, my dear friend, and asked, 'Rachel Cohen? That Rachel Cohen?' his reply shattered me: 'Yes, Rachel. The finest woman we had in this land.' My brother, you’ve been orphaned yet again. We can no longer bear the evil that strikes at the heart of our infinite goodness, over and over.

Israeli iNitative in India aims to help tens of thousands of Israelis who left the country amid war and find themselves having to deal with emotional baggage and trauma It happened one day in Dharamshala, amid the narrow, colorful streets of the mountainous city in northern India, Eitan Langer recounted in an interview with Ynet. Langer, a father of two who served as a detective in the Ofakim police and a reserve combat soldier in Gaza, witnessed the traumatic collapse of a building that killed 21 soldiers. A few months ago, after completing another round of reserve duty, he found himself wandering the streets of India feeling lost. His post-trauma and the heightened alertness that had plagued him since the start of the war wouldn’t let go. 'I thought India would help me, lift me up,' he admitted, 'but in the end, I got lost.' Then, among the flyers posted on café walls in Dharamshala, he saw an ad for a lecture by a former IDF officer who had fought in Gaza, Hezi Shochat, offering to help soldiers make sense of their experiences. 'Seeing Israeli social workers in India was amazing and moving,' Langer said with a smile. Shochat, a reservist officer in an elite IDF unit, a trauma-specialized social worker and a rescue volunteer with Magnus, a company that locates and retrieves travelers abroad, recognized the distress of Israelis traveling to the East between rounds of reserve duty. Together with Tamar Friedman, a trauma-focused social worker, military psychologist and Magnus volunteer, he established Hamakom ('The Place') – a support and growth space in northern India for travelers grappling with emotional challenges related to the war. Why are so many young Israelis seeking refuge in India? Shochat: 'Since October 7, the extent of physical and emotional injuries has left Israel in a state of trauma. About 1.5 million residents suffer from trauma at varying levels and 10,000 soldiers have been diagnosed with stress reactions during the war. Around 80,000 young Israelis have flown to the East to escape, disconnect and forget amid overwhelming mental anguish.' Langer, for example, was diagnosed with post-trauma manifesting as hypervigilance and sleep problems. 'At first, I didn’t understand what was happening to me. It was something new, unfamiliar,' he shared. 'Hezi helped me realize that I’d gone through incredibly difficult experiences — ones that only someone who was there could understand.' When trauma travels with you Among the colorful alleys of Goa and the tranquil streets of Dharamshala, Hamakom, operating seasonally to align with travelers' movements, serves as a beacon of hope. 'We’ve reached a critical juncture,' Shochat said. 'We realized Israel had a kind of back yard where thousands of young people are seeking refuge.' Why do breakdowns often happen in the very places they escape to? 'There are various reasons, but the main ones include the foreign environment, disconnection from family and uncontrolled use of mind-altering substances. These factors pose a real danger to individuals who are already suffering from post-trauma or instability caused by the intense experiences they’ve faced. 'We’ve seen a 500% increase in rescues of young people from the East since October 7,' he added. 'Without professional care to process these experiences, escaping to the East can exacerbate post-traumatic symptoms, trigger emotional breakdowns and even lead to psychosis.' Daily resilience workshops, music and movement therapy and one-on-one conversations are held at Hamakom. 'We don’t just provide treatment,' Shochat explained. 'We create a supportive community. Sometimes it starts with a chat over coffee on the balcony, and from there a significant healing process begins. 'Our uniqueness lies in the combination — we can talk to soldiers about PTSD in professional terms, but we can also say, ‘I was there with you in the field; I understand.’ This creates an immediate trust that’s critical for recovery.' Why India? 'It’s a natural question — why not use the resources available in Israel? The fact is, we’re at a critical crossroads. We don’t aim to administer treatment here; we aim to provide immediate support to those who need help and are in a place where they’re unsure who to turn to. 'Our rationale is to be at this critical point, preventing them from seeking harmful alternatives and guiding them toward safe paths to recovery.' A legacy of support Hamakom is dedicated to the memory of Capt. (res.) Ron Efrimi, Shochat’s unit comrade who was killed in action in Gaza. 'Ron maintained a safe and supportive space for his soldiers and was an anchor for those dealing with stress and anxiety throughout the fighting,' Shochat recalled. 'We’re the second generation of Israelis in India,' Langer reflected. 'The reservists, the older crowd — we have things to lose back home: kids and family. But the younger generation I’ve seen here, they arrive and just break down.' Did you ever feel like you were on the verge of breaking down? Langer: 'The truth is I broke down too at the end of Hezi’s lecture. I got into bed and didn’t get out for two whole days — I just slept. It was like my body did some kind of restart. I realize now that I got a life lesson here.' Following the encounter, Langer decided to return to Israel and begin psychological treatment. 'I understood that I couldn’t keep raising my kids and functioning in this state,' he admitted. 'Thanks to Hezi and the space he and the team created, not only was I able to regain myself — I even returned to reserve duty. 'Hezi managed to normalize the abnormal state I was in,' he said. 'He told me it’s okay to feel how I feel and it’s okay to accept myself even when I’m not okay.' A bridge to long-term rehabilitation The numbers speak for themselves: Since the war began, nearly half of the calls to support hotlines have been from young people ages 20–30 in the IDF, reserves, bereaved families and survivors of the Nova Music Festival massacre. Over 3,000 travelers have received support and aid at Hamakom since its establishment.

'This allows us to ensure continuity of care even after they return to Israel. We’re not just offering immediate support — we’re serving as a bridge to long-term rehabilitation.' But to continue this vital work and provide a light for those searching for their way back to themselves, Hamakom needs support. 'We’ve launched a crowdfunding campaign,' Shochat said. 'Every donation enables us to reach out to another young man or woman, thousands of miles from home, in urgent need of help.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bk00wt59lkx	2025-01-07T06:42:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/06/rJAz00jKUyx/rJAz00jKUyx_0_291_1600_901_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu confidant: 'Stop the war in Gaza immediately'	Natan Eshel, a close confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a message he sent to his associates that 'there is no logic in continuing the fighting in the Gaza Strip, and therefore it must be stopped immediately.' According to him, 'it is a shame for every soldier's life to continue the unnecessary fighting in Gaza. The war is currently not bringing any hostages or military or security achievements.' He added that the solution for him to end the war is a siege: 'This is the only way that has surrendered Jerusalem and its surroundings, and throughout world history, all wars.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1vzu6c8jx	2025-01-07T06:29:20-08:00	
Trump asks New York appeals court to dismiss hush money case befo...	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump asked a New York court on Tuesday to throw out his conviction on charges stemming from hush money paid to a porn star, and to dismiss the case before his scheduled Friday sentencing. The request to a state appeals court marked a last-ditch effort by Trump to block a lower court ruling on Monday to proceed with the sentencing on Friday, 10 days before Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. In Monday's ruling, Justice Juan Merchan rejected a request from Trump's lawyers to delay the sentencing while they appealed two of his previous rulings upholding the Manhattan jury's May guilty verdict on 34 felony counts of falsifying records Trump has long argued that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, brought the case to harm his 2024 reelection campaign. Bragg has said that his office routinely brings felony falsification of business records charges. The hush money case made Trump the first U.S. president - sitting or former - to be charged with and convicted of a crime.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rku7pt98je	2025-01-07T06:25:50-08:00

Hostage families in purgatory between hope and despair as negotia...	As negotiations with Hamas continue over a potential hostage release, families protest government inaction, file legal petitions, and demand the immediate return of all hostages; Delays in Mossad Chief Dedi Barnea’s travel to Qatar highlight stalled proceedings Amid reports of a list of 34 hostages whom Hamas claims it is willing to release, tensions remain high among their families. Mossad Chief Dedi Barnea, who was scheduled to depart for Qatar on Monday for discussions, has yet to travel. Israel continues to await Hamas' response while professional teams in Doha carry on with negotiations. Qatar's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Majed Al-Ansari, stated Monday that negotiations are ongoing 'despite challenging conditions.' He explained that 'technical delegations are meeting regularly, and talks are progressing. However, it is impossible to determine a timeline for reaching an agreement regarding Gaza.' Meanwhile, senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan reiterated the organization’s position: 'A cease-fire, IDF withdrawal, and Gaza’s reconstruction without Israeli conditions are necessary. We address the issue of prisoners in Israeli jails as one unified matter, without referencing specific factions or groups.' Barnea was expected to join U.S. officials and mediators in Doha but has yet to travel, which some interpret as a sign of difficulties in the talks. Sources familiar with the negotiations said Monday that 'Barnea’s travel depends on sufficient progress. If he goes, it signals a decisive stage in the negotiations. Meanwhile, there is cautious optimism in Israel that talks are moving in the right direction.' However, others expressed skepticism. 'Barnea's travel should not necessarily be seen as a measure of Israel's seriousness,' a source said. He has traveled to Qatar before, merely to appease his superiors. A more significant indicator would be if CIA Director Bill Burns goes to Qatar, as he would not waste his time without tangible progress. The same gaps in the negotiations persist, particularly regarding IDF withdrawal and a return to the north, not just the names for the first phase of releases.' Families take legal action and protest against government inaction Separately, 112 family members of hostages filed a groundbreaking petition with the Supreme Court, accusing the government of violating two Basic Laws by 'abandoning their loved ones in Hamas tunnels in Gaza for 459 days.' The petition, filed against the government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, claims 'the government has unlawfully abandoned the hostages for 459 days, violating their constitutional rights to life, bodily integrity and human dignity.' Petitioners emphasized that their appeal to the Supreme Court is made on behalf of the hostages, requesting urgent interim and conditional orders requiring the state to explain 'why the Israeli government’s refusal to agree to a deal for the release of hostages held in Gaza by the Hamas terrorist organization does not unlawfully infringe on the constitutional right of the hostages to life, bodily integrity and human dignity. Consequently, the government must act to secure their release, including agreeing to a cease-fire and withdrawing from Gaza in exchange for the hostages’ freedom.' Kobi Ohel, the father of hostage Alon Ohel, expressed his efforts to remain optimistic. 'I constantly focus on the positive, visualizing Alon with me. I want to believe the prime minister and the negotiation team are doing everything to achieve a comprehensive deal to bring everyone home,' he said in an interview with Ynet. 'I am confident the prime minister can reach a comprehensive agreement – I don’t understand why it needs to be done in phases.' Conversely, Simona Steinbrecher, the mother of hostage Doron Steinbrecher, expressed her skepticism. 'I’m not optimistic about the negotiations,' she said. 'We’ve been in this situation many times before, and things always fell apart at the last moment. There’s nothing new in the list. They keep talking, but we need to get everyone out because the conditions are horrific. If the hostages all return in body bags, there’s no future for this country. Everyone must understand that if they or their children are taken hostage, they will receive no help.' During a cabinet meeting in Tel Aviv, hostage families protested, urging decision-makers not to 'miss the historic opportunity to reach an agreement that guarantees the return of all the hostages.' The families displayed a list of all 100 hostages at the protest site. Ella Ben-Ami, the daughter of hostage Ohad Ben-Ami, stated, 'On October 7, I lost my trust in the country. I lost my sense of security in my own home. The only thing that can restore my faith and safety is the return of all 100 hostages.' Sharon Calderon, the sister-in-law of hostage Ofer Calderon, shared the emotional toll, saying, 'For 459 days, we’ve had no day or night. We’re all stuck in the same safe room as that cursed Saturday. We just want our loved ones home. We want everyone back now, in one phase. We’re not giving up on anyone—not the soldiers, the young people, the women, the fathers, no one.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Doron Zekzer, the adoptive father of hostage Idan Alexander, emphasized: 'A true victory is 100 families reunited, closing the circle. One hundred families returning to life, breathing again, resuming normalcy, and starting their healing process. The cabinet’s only focus should be on how to bring them home. The real victory image is everyone back home.' Avivit Yahalomi, the sister of Hanan Yablonka, who was murdered on October 7 and whose body was returned from Gaza, shared her pain: 'Hanan came back as a corpse from Hamas tunnels. He came back in a bag. We don’t want our hostages to return like this. We’re broken. We stand here crying out to bring them home—both the living and the dead for burial. We don’t want bags; we want them back in a deal. No family should have to receive a bag like we did. We will continue to cry out that every single hostage must come back home.' Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, addressed the negotiations, expressing optimism about the involvement of President-elect Donald Trump. 'I believe the president-elect knows how to generate public opinion and apply pressure,' he said. 'The issue of the hostages is close to his heart. The incoming administration will back Israel, and we’ll receive more support from his government.' Danon also commented on footage of hostages in Hamas captivity recently released, saying: 'The evidence is harrowing. We are sharing these details at the UN to highlight the hostages' suffering.' Former Defense Minister and IDF Chief of Staff Moshe 'Bogie' Ya’alon criticized the government in an interview with Ynet, accusing it of being willing to 'abandon the hostages' and refusing to release them, stating: 'They don’t want to end the war.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryvdl39ukg	2025-01-07T06:02:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/06/BJWfMhKUyx/BJWfMhKUyx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
This is the Emirati version of 'Gaza, the day after'	In the shadow of the talks for a cease-fire deal with Hamas, officials in Abu Dhabi are discussing the question of managing Gaza after the war, and are ready to send forces for temporary joint management with the US, but are also demanding the promotion of a Palestinian state and hoping that peace with Israel will be a lever of pressure on Netanyahu. The United Arab Emirates has discussed with Israel and the United States participating in a provisional administration of post-war Gaza until a reformed Palestinian Authority is able to take charge, according to people familiar with the talks. The behind-the-scenes discussions, reported by Reuters for the first time, included the possibility of the UAE and the United States, along with other nations, temporarily overseeing the governance, security and reconstruction of Gaza after the Israeli military withdraws and until a Palestinian administration is able to take over, a dozen foreign diplomats and Western officials told Reuters. The UAE is a close security partner of the U.S. and, unlike most Arab governments, has diplomatic ties with Israel. The diplomats and officials said this provides the Gulf state with some leverage over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government. After more than a year of war, Israel remains reluctant to outline its own vision for Gaza and the international community has struggled to formulate a viable plan, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the conversations were private. The diplomats and officials stressed the ideas that had emerged from the UAE talks lacked detail and had not been distilled into a formal, written plan nor adopted by any government. In the behind-the-scenes talks, Abu Dhabi is advocating for a reformed Palestinian Authority (PA) to govern Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem under an independent Palestinian state, the sources said - something that Israel has publicly opposed. 'The UAE will not participate in any plan that fails to include significant reform of the Palestinian Authority, its empowerment, and the establishment of a credible roadmap toward a Palestinian state,' a UAE official told Reuters, in response to questions about the discussions. 'These elements - which are currently lacking - are essential for the success of any post-Gaza plan,' the official said. The PA was established three decades ago under the 1993-1995 Oslo Accords, signed by Israel and Palestinians, and given limited authority over the West Bank and Gaza. It still exercises some governance in the Israeli-occupied West Bank but was run out of Gaza in 2007 by Hamas after a brief civil war. A U.S. State Department spokesperson told Reuters there had been talks with several partners, including the UAE, on options for governance, security and reconstruction, and that various draft proposals, plans and ideas had been put forward by partners. 'These have been deliberative discussions that continue, as we seek the best way forward,' the spokesperson said, declining to comment further on 'private diplomatic conversations.' The prime minister's office declined comment for this story. The Palestinian Authority did not respond to Reuters' questions. In addition to reforming the PA, four of the diplomats and Western officials said that Emirati officials had suggested the use of private military contractors as part of a post-war peacekeeping force in Gaza. The other sources confirmed they were briefed on what they described as Emirati post-war proposals, which included the possible use of such forces. The diplomats and Western officials said any deployment of such contractors would spark concerns among Western nations. Private military contractors, hired by the United States and other governments, have faced accusations of torture, human rights abuses, and use of excessive force, among other allegations, including in Iraq and Afghanistan. The UAE official did not respond to questions about the use of military contractors. Reconstruction will take years Rebuilding Gaza, including its political institutions, is expected to take years and cost tens of billions of dollars, requiring substantial international support, following 15 months of Israel's devastating military campaign. While the UAE has criticized the conduct of Israel's military and Netanyahu himself, Israel still wants the oil-rich nation involved in post-war Gaza, according to two former Israeli officials, who declined to be identified. Like Israel, the Gulf state opposes Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group that led the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war. Abu Dhabi views Hamas and other Islamist groups as destabilizing forces. UAE officials have also expressed concern publicly over the war's impact on stability in the Middle East and on efforts toward greater regional integration and economic development. Asked whether Hamas was aware of proposals discussed by the UAE, Basem Naim, one of the organization's senior officials, told Reuters that after the war, Gaza must be 'distinctly Palestinian' and without 'foreign interventions.' Washington is pushing, alongside mediators Egypt and Qatar, for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Israel and Hamas traded blame in late December for delays in reaching a ceasefire – which both sides had said appeared to be close last month. On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington wanted to see a ceasefire deal concluded in the next two weeks. When asked about the future of Gaza, Brian Hughes, a spokesman for Donald Trump's transition team, said the U.S. president-elect - who is due to take office on Jan. 20 - would work in close coordination with Arab and Israeli partners 'to ensure that Gaza can one day prosper.' Reform of Palestinian Authority The Gulf state has said it would only send troops to a post-war multinational mission at the invitation of the Palestinian Authority and with the involvement of the U.S. Netanyahu, however, has said he is against the Palestinian Authority in its current form governing Gaza, citing his long-standing grievances over the PA's school syllabus, which he says fuels hatred of Israel, and its policy of giving salaries to families of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. The UAE has called for a new prime minister to lead the Palestinian Authority, which Emirati officials frequently criticized as corrupt and inept during the closed-door talks, the diplomats and officials said, without providing specifics. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa, who took office in March, has pledged to implement reforms within the Palestinian Authority whose finances have been in disarray for years as donor states have cut back funding until corruption and waste are tackled. Emirati officials have mentioned former prime minister Salam Fayyad, a U.S.-educated former World Bank official, as the type of person who would be credible to lead a revamped Palestinian Authority, according to the diplomats and officials. Fayyad served as prime minister from 2007 until resigning in 2013 after falling out with President Mahmoud Abbas, who remains in office. Reuters was unable to reach Fayyad for comment. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjxcon5lke	2025-01-07T05:50:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2021/03/10/ryVoGEU700/ryVoGEU700_0_0_640_360_0_small.jpg

No more favors from Uncle Sam: Elbit to manufacture munitions for...	Israel’s Defense Ministry signs a massive deal with Elbit Systems to produce heavy air munitions and establish a national raw materials facility; The agreements aim to strengthen domestic defense manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign imports The Israeli Ministry of Defense has entered into two major strategic agreements with Elbit Systems, amounting to a total of $276 million. These agreements include the production of thousands of heavy air munitions and the establishment of a national facility for manufacturing raw materials. The overarching goal is to enhance Israel's independence in defense production and reduce reliance on foreign imports, a key objective outlined in the Ministry of Defense's plan, which was first revealed by Ynet. This initiative stems from a significant lesson learned during the Gaza war. At certain points during the conflict, the Biden administration delayed the delivery of heavy air munitions to Israel due to sharp disagreements with the Netanyahu government. Additionally, difficulties in sourcing raw materials from foreign suppliers further underscored the urgent need to reduce Israel’s dependency on imported defense supplies. Strengthening domestic production capabilities As part of the first agreement, Elbit Systems will supply the Ministry of Defense with thousands of heavy air munitions. The second agreement, led by the ministry's Planning Directorate and MAFAT (Directorate of Defense Research and Development), focuses on establishing a national manufacturing facility for raw materials. This facility will produce energetic materials critical to Israel’s defense industries, including those required for 'explosive chemistry' processes essential to bomb production. 'Today, we are laying the foundation for expanding Israel’s production self-sufficiency in two critical areas that are essential for the long-term operational capabilities of the IDF,' said Eyal Zamir, Director General of the Ministry of Defense, during the signing ceremony at Elbit Systems’ plant in Ramat HaSharon. 'These agreements will secure Israel’s independent capacity to manufacture a wide range of bombs and munitions. This historic initiative began before the war but was accelerated during it. We expect to see initial production capabilities in the near future, which will continue to expand until full independence is achieved in both areas.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Bezhalel (Butzi) Machlis, President and CEO of Elbit Systems, emphasized the company’s commitment to this effort, stating: 'Elbit Systems is a full partner of the IDF and the Ministry of Defense in advancing the 'blue-and-white' (colors of the Israeli flag) production policy. We are dedicated to significantly strengthening IDF's self-reliance in munitions production. The deep and longstanding partnership between Elbit and the defense establishment not only contributes to national security but also supports the Israeli economy and provides livelihoods for thousands of families across the country.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkumeq98ye	2025-01-07T04:30:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/11/07/9583431/9583431_1_112_980_552_0_small.jpg

First sergeant Ido Samiach falls in Gaza fighting	The 20-year-old soldier from the Nahal Brigade's special forces unit was killed in Beit Hanoun; he is the 828th member of the forces to be killed since the war began; public invited to join flag parade honoring him The IDF said on Tuesday that Staff sergeant Ido Samiach, 20 from Ganei Tikva, a member of the Nahal Brigade's special unit, fell in Beit Hanoun, in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. He is the 828th IDF fatality since the war began. The Ganei Tikva municipality said he will be interned in the local cemetery on Wednesday and invited the public to join a flag parade along the road to the cemetery to honor him.

How Hebrew rose again: The revolutionary revival of Modern Hebrew	Comment: Today's Hebrew continues to grow, absorbing new words with the enthusiasm of a hungry IDF recruit The transformation of Hebrew from a dormant liturgical language into a vibrant modern tongue stands as one of history's most remarkable linguistic achievements. This revival wasn't just an academic exercise. It was a cultural revolution complete with street protests, family dramas, and eventually, a healthy dose of military humor. Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, the stubborn visionary behind modern Hebrew, took his mission so seriously that he forbade his wife from singing lullabies to their son in any language but Hebrew. This made their child, Ben-Zion (later Itamar Ben-Avi), the first native Hebrew speaker in nearly two millennia - though one has to wonder if he occasionally dreamed in Yiddish. The Language Wars of 1913-1914 centered around the Technion in Haifa, where the proposal to use German as the primary language of instruction sparked what might be called the world's most educated riot. Students and teachers staged walkouts that would make modern social media activists proud, armed with nothing but their conviction and strongly-worded pamphlets. Key figures like Ahad Ha'am (Asher Ginsberg) argued for Hebrew as a cultural necessity, while David Yellin developed educational methodologies. Hayim Nahman Bialik expanded the language's literary capacity through poetry, and Naphtali Herz Tur-Sinai tackled the challenge of scientific terminology. The pronunciation debate added another layer of complexity. Ashkenazi Jews maintained certain distinctions lost in Sephardic pronunciation, while Yemenite Jews preserved even more elaborate sound distinctions. The adoption of Sephardic pronunciation as the standard became both a linguistic and political statement, breaking with diaspora traditions. The Hebrew Teachers Union (established 1903) faced the monumental task of standardizing teaching methods and creating new terminology. Imagine describing a smartphone using biblical Hebrew - it required linguistic gymnastics worthy of an Olympic medal. Words like 'חשמל' (electricity) and 'מחשב' (computer) emerged through clever adaptation of ancient roots. The resistance came from multiple directions: Ultra-Orthodox communities viewed secular use of Hebrew as nearly blasphemous- they preferred having Yiddish as the day-to-day language, German-Jewish intellectuals insisted on German's superiority for science, and British Mandate authorities pushed for English administration. Parents worried about their children's future in a world where Hebrew wasn't exactly LinkedIn's most requested language skill. The IDF became an unexpected linguistic laboratory, generating colorful military slang. 'Jobnik' (the one who has a job) (ג'ובניק) emerged as the slightly teasing term for non-combat soldiers, while 'Achi' (אחי, 'my brother') became the universal term of address. 'Pazam' (פז'ם) became both a countdown to release and a state of mind. Modern Hebrew has evolved into a language equally comfortable with biblical prophecies and TikTok challenges. Take: 'על הפנים' (al ha-panim) literally translates to 'on the face' but is used colloquially to mean 'terrible,' 'awful,' or 'messed up.' Today's Hebrew continues to grow, absorbing new words with the enthusiasm of a hungry recruit at the mess hall. As soldiers say, 'Yalla Bye' (יאללה ביי) - a perfect linguistic mix of Arabic and English, that would make the 1920s purists spill their café botz (Turkish coffee, literally 'mud coffee'). One anonymous Israeli soldier quipped: 'If Moses heard us speaking Hebrew today, he'd probably need a translator - and a strong drink to cope with our slang.' But that's the beauty of a living language - it evolves, adapts, and occasionally makes the ancestors raise an eyebrow or two from above. The success of Modern Hebrew stands as a testament to human determination, cultural preservation, and the unwavering commitment of a people to achieve their national linguistic renaissance, transforming what others deemed impossible into reality. Through meticulous linguistic innovation, ancient Semitic roots have been ingeniously adapted to embrace modern concepts, from 'סלפי' (selfie) to 'מטבע מבוזר' (cryptocurrency, literally 'decentralized currency'), creating a seamless bridge between biblical heritage and contemporary life. This revival demonstrates how Hebrew serves not just as a means of communication, but as a powerful tool for national Jewish identity and cultural continuity, making Hebrew unique among the world's languages as the only successfully revived ancient tongue now serving millions in their daily lives.

Hamas uses Gaza hospitals for command, distribution of arms and s...	IDF releases footage of a captured Hamas terrorist describing how the terror groups launched attacks from the hospital in Gaza believing it safe from Israeli attack moving anti-tank missiles, grenades and small arms through the facility A captured Hamas terrorist who was employed at the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya said the facility was used by the terror group as a command center, a launch bad for attacks and a point for the distribution of arms to Hamas fighters. The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit published on Tuesday a clip of the interrogation of the terrorist, a 21-year-old cleaner at the hospital who was a member of the Nuchbah force since he joined the terror group in 2021. The IDF arrested some 240 individuals, the largest number of terrorists caught in one location, in the hospital compound and shut it down. 'They believe the hospital is a safe haven for them because the military cannot directly target it with an F-16 missile or destroy the building since there are civilians and patients there,' said 21-year-old Anas Muhammad Faiz Al-Sharif, who described working as a cleaning supervisor at the hospital. 'I joined the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades in 2021, serving in the Nukhba Force. I was arrested at the Kamal Adwan Hospital, where medical staff was staying alongside operatives from Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Al-Nassr Brigades and other organizations in northern Gaza.' When asked what the terrorists were doing at the hospital, he answered: 'They were transferring equipment and weapons, like AK-47s, bullets and pistols. The weapons were brought to and from the hospital, in and out. Reconnaissance units and patrols would leave the hospital late at night.' According to Sharif, 'They [terrorists] would arrive at the hospital in the morning and distribute grenade and mortar munitions for attacking tanks, whether at Kamal Adwan, Falouja (in the Jabaliya refugee camp), or areas with newly established (terrorist) presence.' Over 240 terrorists were arrested during the operation in Jabaliya and around 20 were killed in battle. IDF Naval commandos from Shayetet 13 discovered limited weaponry at the hospital but encountered an exceptionally large number of terrorists — the largest group apprehended in a single location in Gaza since the war began. Commanders from the 401st Brigade, which spearheaded the operation, noted that some Hamas terrorists wore fake bandages to disguise themselves as wounded or sick individuals.

Courtesy of Golani: A tour through ravaged Radwan Force stronghol...	Reporter's notebook: Golani troops in South Lebanon, where destruction looms large, Hezbollah’s tactics are exposed, and personal stories of resilience emerge; tasked with dismantling terror infrastructure, securing border and ensuring residents can safely return to north We are driving along the winding mountain road through the Shi'ite town of Al-Adisa. The scenery is breathtaking, with clear skies unbroken by clouds. Yet the weather is deceptive—stepping out of the jeep, the chill of the Lebanese winter is immediately felt, piercing even through ceramic body armor. The destruction here is absolute. According to satellite images analyzed by geo-analyst Ben-Zion Maklis, 80% of Al-Adisa's homes have been destroyed. No one remains in the town, but scattered remnants of the lives lived here can still be found: a school backpack with a blue elephant illustration, a child’s lone shoe, empty packaging for cellular equipment, a grocery store frozen in time. Suddenly, by the roadside, we see his face: Hassan Nasrallah, his thick beard, black turban, and smug grin staring at us from a pierced banner made of tarpaulin. To his left is Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, and to his right, Imad Mughniyeh. This is just 430 yards from Kibbutz Misgav Am. The night before, fighters from Golani Brigade’s 12th Battalion raided the town, which had been occupied just prior to the cease-fire. Their mission was to locate and destroy as much of Hezbollah's infrastructure and weaponry as possible before IDF withdrew from Lebanon. 'Al-Adisa was supposed to serve as a launch point for the takeover of Misgav Am by a Radwan Force company,' explains the battalion commander, Lt. Col. Miran Altit, who oversees the Rami Ridge sector on both sides of the border. 'Last night’s raid uncovered six crates of rockets, anti-tank missiles, IEDs, and RPGs in a residential home.' Civilians and combat Lieutenant Omer, a platoon commander in the battalion, describes how Hezbollah used civilians as shields. 'In one of the villages, we entered a children’s room and found a toy car, a baby swing, and a blue barrel containing a combat vest and the father’s combat gear. Weapons are everywhere.' This is the battalion’s sixth combat front since the war began. On October 7, they were urgently deployed to the Gaza border region and fought in its southern region; then they moved to maneuver combat in Gaza and Khan Younis. From there, they headed north to defend Mount Dov for over seven months. When the maneuver into Lebanon began, the battalion operated in both central and western sectors. 'We carried out three large-scale raids under the 188th Armored Brigade’s battle team—in the towns of Yaroun, Aita ash-Shab, and on the Shiite ridge,' says Altit. Now, they are stationed at the peak that has loomed over the Galilee Panhandle for years. We pass through the village of Kila, where one-third of the homes have been destroyed. Dozens of anti-tank missiles were fired from here at Metula since the start of the war. To the east rises Mount Hermon, its snowy peaks glistening. To the north stands the Beaufort Fortress. These valleys and dirt roads, I recognize from my own days as a soldier in the Security Zone 30 years ago. Michael, a battalion fighter and the company commander’s radio operator, is from Metula. His parents are divorced—his father lives in the center of the country, and his mother, a special education teacher, resides in Metula. 'On October 7, when we were deployed to the Gaza border region, they took our phones. Two weeks later, before we entered Gaza, they gave them back so we could update our families. That’s when I found out my family had been evacuated from Metula.' Initially, they lived in a Tel Aviv hotel. After a few months, they moved to a rented apartment in the city center. 'In recent weeks, when I’ve been on leave, I’ve been going back to our house in Metula to clean and organize. Of everyone in my family, our house suffered the least damage—just items knocked over by shockwaves, broken glassware, and overall neglect. My grandfather’s house was hit worse, and my uncle’s house was completely destroyed by an anti-tank missile.' For Michael, fighting in Lebanon, just a stone’s throw from his home, feels like the closing of a circle. 'Most of my friends in Metula are soldiers, and every one of them will tell you it’s been their dream since childhood. We’d see the houses in Kila, Al-Adisa, and Al-Khiam, and all we wanted was to one day go in there. It’s like a dream come true, seeing Metula from the other side of the border. I even got to see our house from inside Lebanon. I see it standing, relatively intact, and I see the destruction in the Lebanese villages from which they fired at us, and I think: ‘We’re winning.’ I hope we get to go home soon.' 'This is our ultimate mission,' says Lt. Col. Altit, 'to create the conditions for the residents to return. I see farmers rehabilitating fields, chicken coops resuming operations, and residents beginning to renovate their homes. It highlights the importance of our task. My dream is that by Passover, all the residents will return, and I’ll still be here to celebrate the Seder with them.' Altit, 32, lives in Haifa and is married to Talia, a medical student at the Technion. On October 7, he was still a trainee at the Command and Staff College. 'The war caught us on our honeymoon. Two days before it started, we returned from South Africa.' When asked if, as both a resident and a family man, he would return to Metula, Kiryat Shmona, or Misgav Am now, or wait, Altit responds: 'It’s a tough question. The villages that threatened Metula and Misgav Am are destroyed, and there are no more terrorists here. I believe that thanks to the IDF’s work, the conditions for the residents’ return will soon be ripe.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Last week, journalist Nahum Barnea wrote that the deployment of the Lebanese Army in the area has been slower than expected, which could delay the IDF’s withdrawal beyond the 60 days agreed upon in the ceasefire. 'That’s not my concern as a battalion commander,' says Altit. 'We’re here until we receive other orders. There’s still work to do.' Since the war began, 107 soldiers and commanders from the Golani Brigade have fallen, most from the 13th and 51st battalions, which were stationed in Gaza on October 7. The 12th Battalion has also suffered losses. 'I personally lost 15 friends and acquaintances, most from the brigade,' says Lt. Omer. 'Staff Sergeant Noam Israel Abdu was my radio operator. He fell in Gaza as a squad leader trainee on the anniversary of the October 7 attack. When we destroy a rocket launcher, we say: ‘This is for Noam.’' Michael adds: 'I want to honor two soldiers from my company who fell—Noam Abdu and Sergeant Maor Cohen Eizenkot. We think about them every day and honor them with flags, stickers, company evenings, and by staying connected with their families. When new recruits join the company after training, we tell them about Noam and Maor. We’re fighting here to continue their legacy.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hkwzodquye	2025-01-07T02:06:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/06/yk14214273/yk14214273_0_0_935_586_0_small.jpg

HRF files complaint alleging war crimes against IDF soldier in Ar...	Pro-Palestinian group sends alleged photos and videos of soldier in Gaza claiming he used civilians as 'human shields'; Brazilian police reconsiders similar charges against troop who fled country A complaint was filed in Argentina on Tuesday by the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) claiming an IDF soldier visiting the country committed war crimes. The pro-Palestine group presented photos and video clips showing the soldier posing for cameras with a blindfolded Palestinian detained by the troops, 'using him as a human shield.' The HRF claimed it was in possession of more photographic evidence that the soldier took clothes from displaced Gazans and organized attacks against civilian infrastructure including setting homes on fire. He was heard, they claim, instructing homes to be destroyed while residents were inside and tried to destroy evidence of his actions. The foundation’s leaders include Diab Abu Jahjah and Karim Hassoun, both based in Belgium. Abu Jahjah, a long-time supporter of Hezbollah, once described the September 11 attacks as 'sweet revenge' in a 2003 New York Times interview. He also founded the Arab League in Europe and continues to post inflammatory statements against Israel on social media. Hassoun, chairman of the Arab European League since 2005, has consistently refused to recognize Israel, describing it as a 'colonialist and racist state.' Following the October 7 Hamas terror attack, Hassoun wrote: 'The Palestinians are not invading Israel; they are returning home and reclaiming their property.' The Hind Rajab Foundation’s latest actions underscore a growing challenge for Israel, as legal threats against IDF personnel escalate worldwide. By acting swiftly, the Foreign Ministry demonstrated its commitment to protecting Israeli citizens from targeted legal and political campaigns. However, the case serves as a stark reminder of the risks Israeli soldiers face abroad. Meanwhile, Brazil's federal police on Tuesday appealed to the federal court and said further inspection is required in the case of an IDF soldier the HRF filed a complaint against for alleged war crimes in Gaza, to prove his connection to the alleged incidents and allow him to be prosecuted in the country. The foundation which was named for a six-year-old Palestinian girl who was claimed to have been killed by IDF fire during the war, said that the Brazilian government decided to take action after a complaint was filed against the Israeli who arrived in Brazil a week ago. In their complaint, the foundation said his actions were part of a broader effort that included genocide and crimes against humanity, according to international law. The Israeli soldier left the country with his friends before legal action could be taken against him, his family told Ynet, adding they were relieved after a tense period of time and were awaiting his return home. 'He's out of there,' his father said. 'Everything will be fine.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Against this backdrop, local news outlet Metropoles reported a disagreement among federal police officials regarding the legitimacy of such an investigation. A request for a review of the decision read that 'technical and legal issues' surrounding such a move need resolution. According to the report, some investigators in the Brazilian police argue that a war crimes investigation against the soldier could rely on Brazil's status as a signatory to the Rome Statute, which underpins the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Others, however, believe that this is insufficient for prosecution and that a local law defining such an offense is needed. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1l37oq8kx	2025-01-07T01:11:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/05/SyUVIsv8Jg/SyUVIsv8Jg_0_0_2048_1152_0_small.jpg

Death toll nears 100 and rising, in powerful Tibet quake	magnitude 6.8 earthquake rocked the northern foothills of the Himalayas near one of Tibet's holiest cities and 50 miles from Mount Everest; tremors felt in Nepal; A magnitude 6.8 earthquake rocked the northern foothills of the Himalayas near one of Tibet's holiest cities on Tuesday, Chinese authorities said, killing at least 95 people and shaking buildings in neighboring Nepal, Bhutan and India. The quake hit at 9:05 a.m. (0105 GMT), with its epicenter located in Tingri, a rural county known as the northern gateway to the Everest region, at a depth of 10 km (6.2 miles), according to the China Earthquake Networks Centre. The U.S. Geological Service put the quake's magnitude at 7.1. At least 95 people were known to have been killed and 130 injured on the Tibetan side, China's state-run television reported six hours later. There were no reports of deaths elsewhere. Southwestern parts of China, Nepal and northern India are frequently hit by earthquakes caused by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. Tuesday's epicenter was around 80 km (50 miles) north of Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain and a popular destination for climbers and trekkers. Winter is not a popular season for climbers and hikers in Nepal, with a German climber the lone mountaineer with a permit to climb Mount Everest. He had already left the base camp after failing to reach the summit, Lilathar Awasthi, a Department of Tourism official, said. Nepal's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) said the tremors were felt in seven hill districts bordering Tibet. 'So far we have not received any information of any loss of life and property,' NDRRMA spokesman Dizan Bhattarai told Reuters. 'We have mobilised police, security forces and local authorities to collect information,' he said. Many villages in the Nepalese border area, which are sparsely populated, are remote and can only be reached by foot. The impact of the quake was felt across the Shigatse region of Tibet, home to 800,000 people. The region is administered by Shigatse city, the traditional seat of the Panchen Lama, one of the most important figures in Tibetan Buddhism. Chinese President Xi Jinping said all-out search and rescue efforts should be carried out to minimise casualties, properly resettle the affected people, and ensure a safe and warm winter. More than 1,500 local firefighters and rescue workers have been dispatched to the affected areas, China's Xinhua news agency reported. Some 22,000 items including cotton tents, cotton coats, quilts and folding beds have also been sent to the quake-hit region, it said. Tremors, aftershocks Villages in Tingri, where the average elevation is around 4,000-5,000 meters (13,000-16,000 feet), reported strong shaking during the quake, which was followed by dozens of aftershocks with magnitudes of up to 4.4. Crumbled shop fronts could be seen in a video on social media showing the aftermath in the town of Lhatse, with debris spilling out onto the road. Reuters was able to confirm the location based on nearby buildings, windows, road layout, and signage that match satellite and street view imagery. There are three townships and 27 villages within 20 km (12 miles) of the epicenter, with a total population of around 6,900, and more than 1,000 houses have been damaged, Xinhua reported. Local government officials were liaising with nearby towns to gauge the impact of the quake and check for casualties, and China closed the Everest region to tourists after the quake, it added. The Tingri tremor was caused by a rupture in what is known as the Lhasa block in an area under north-south compression and west-east stress, CCTV reported, citing Chinese experts. Since 1950, there have been 21 earthquakes of magnitude 6 or above in the Lhasa block, the largest of which was the 6.9-magnitude quake in Mainling in 2017, according to CCTV. Mainling is located in the lower reaches of Tibet's Yarlung Zangbo river where China is planning to build the world's largest hydropower dam. A magnitude 7.8 tremor struck near Nepal's capital Kathmandu in 2015, killing about 9,000 people and injuring thousands in the country's worst ever earthquake. Among the dead were at least 18 people killed at the Mount Everest base camp when it was hit by an avalanche. On Tuesday, tremors were felt in Kathmandu, some 400 km (250 miles) from the epicenter, and residents in the city ran out of their houses. 'The bed was shaking and I thought my child was moving the bed ... I didn't pay that much attention but the shaking of (a) window made me understand that it's an earthquake,' said Kathmandu resident Meera Adhikarii. 'I'm still shaking out of fear and am in shock.' One person was injured in Kathmandu when he jumped off the top of a house after feeling the strong tremors, Nepal Police spokesman Bishwa Adhikari said. The man was being treated in hospital.

Terror victim's family wins court order to seize Palestinian Auth...	The Yaniv family, whose sons Hallel and Yagel were murdered in a terrorist attack in February 2023, secured a court order to seize $5.2 million from Palestinian Authority funds under a new law compensating terror victims and targeting terrorism financing Israel has seized $5.2 million from Palestinian Authority funds following a lawsuit filed by the Yaniv family, whose sons, Hallel and Yagel Yaniv, were murdered in a terrorist shooting at the Huwara junction in February 2023. The Jerusalem District Court approved the seizure based on a lawsuit submitted last week by the family, alongside a request for a temporary freeze of PA funds held by Israel. The lawsuit was made possible under the Compensation for Terror Victims (Exemplary Damages) Law enacted in 2024. The lawsuit targets the PA’s policy of paying stipends to terrorists and their families. The Yaniv family’s legal team argued that 'senior Palestinian officials openly declare that payments to terrorists are a supreme national value. They have even stated that if the PA had only one shekel left, it would be given to 'martyrs' and prisoners.' The legal filing also cited a previous court ruling, which rejected the PA’s defense that these payments were 'social benefits,' instead labeling them as a 'criminal incentive system.' The murder of Hallel and Yagel Yaniv Hallel Menachem Yaniv and Yagel Yaakov Yaniv, two brothers in their early 20s, were brutally murdered on February 26, 2023, in a nationalist-motivated terrorist attack near Huwara. According to the request submitted by their parents, Esther and Shalom Yaniv, through attorney Asher Shatov, founder of the Justice for Terror Victims organization, the attacker was a resident of Nablus, a city under PA control. The terrorist was killed during a firefight with Israeli security forces during an attempt to apprehend him. The lawsuit details the events of the attack, stating that the terrorist arrived at the main road in Huwara and waited for a vehicle carrying Israeli settlers. Spotting the victims’ car stuck in traffic, the terrorist approached on foot, reaching the front passenger window before firing multiple rounds at close range, killing both brothers instantly. The terrorist’s two sons allegedly assisted him in the attack and have been arrested, with legal proceedings ongoing against them. The lawsuit includes claims against these accomplices as well. The legal filing was made under the Compensation for Terror Victims Law, which came into effect in June 2024. This new legislation entitles the heirs of individuals killed in terrorist attacks to exemplary compensation of $2.6 million per victim. The law allows such claims to be made against both the perpetrators of terrorist acts and those who fund terrorism. Since the law’s enactment, Israeli courts have issued several temporary seizure orders targeting PA funds held by Israel. For instance, in November 2024, $44 million of PA funds were seized following lawsuits filed by families of victims of the Nova music festival massacre. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Adv. Asher Shetov, who represents the Yaniv family and heads the Justice for Terror Victims organization, said: 'The Compensation for Terror Victims Law, which we initiated and was passed in the Knesset this year, will lead to billions of dollars in compensation for families of terror victims. The Yaniv family’s lawsuit achieves two key goals: providing fair compensation for the family and striking a financial blow to the infrastructure that funds and incentivizes terrorist attacks. This lawsuit is part of a series of legal actions we are pursuing, and we are committed to continuing to support terror victims in filing claims to deplete terrorism’s financial sources and ensure justice for its victims.' Shalom Yaniv, the father of Hallel and Yagel, added: 'Nothing can bring back our sons or ease the pain in our hearts. However, the seizure of PA funds is a step toward justice for our family and for the victims of terrorism. It is a just and necessary action, and every family affected by terrorism should take similar steps to send a clear message that those funding terrorism will also pay the price financially. At the same time, Israel must take a firm stance on deporting terrorists. We are grateful to the Justice for Terror Victims organization for guiding us through this legal process.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjcaduqujl	2025-01-06T23:17:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/02/26/SyoRAxKAs/SyoRAxKAs_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Are Israeli soldiers at risk of arrest abroad?	Arsen Ostrovsky: Israel needs to make clear to every country that if they should try and indict or arrest an Israeli individual, that will severely harm their bilateral relations Israeli soldiers traveling abroad will need to exercise greater caution, following an investigation into alleged war crimes involving a soldier visiting Brazil, according to international human rights attorney Arsen Ostrovsky. 'So far, Israel has been able to stay ahead of this particular incident,' Ostrovsky noted. 'But that may not always be the case.' He emphasized the importance of Israel taking a strong stance to protect its citizens: 'Israel needs to make clear to every country that if they should try and indict or arrest an Israeli individual, that will severely harm their bilateral relations with the State of Israel.' Ostrovsky further stressed the need for cooperation with key allies, particularly the United States, to counter such actions. 'Israel, working with allies, primarily the United States, should make clear to other countries that if they should entertain lawfare campaigns to abuse the rule of law and international legal system for these vexatious and baseless claims, they too will suffer the consequences, including possible sanctions upon these countries,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjqckbqikx	2025-01-06T21:31:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/03/BJsqFUr8kx/BJsqFUr8kx_0_0_1601_901_0_small.jpg

What’s driving Biden’s last-minute arms deal with Israel?	The deal is said to include heavy bombs, precision munitions, artillery shells, and fighter jet supplies With less than two weeks until Donald Trump’s inauguration, a significant change has already reshaped Senate leadership. On Friday, John Thune officially replaced Mitch McConnell as Senate Majority Leader. McConnell stepped down after nearly two decades at the helm, making way for Thune to lead the Republican-majority Senate—albeit by a slim margin. One of Thune’s immediate challenges will be overseeing the confirmation of President Trump’s key nominees for top administration roles. Among the appointments are former Governor Mike Huckabee as U.S. Ambassador to Israel and Morgan Ortagus, recently nominated to serve as Deputy Mideast Envoy. While Huckabee’s nomination has garnered widespread support, several of Trump’s picks have sparked debate, even within Republican circles. In the House of Representatives, Louisiana Congressman Mike Johnson was re-elected as Speaker on Friday. Johnson’s leadership is expected to provide stability for Republicans as they pursue their priorities, including today’s formal count of the Electoral College votes. Johnson, a vocal supporter of Israel, previously spearheaded the House’s approval of $14 billion in aid to the Jewish state last spring. Meanwhile, reports in American media indicate that outgoing President Joe Biden plans to finalize a substantial arms package for Israel before leaving office. The deal is said to include heavy bombs, precision munitions, artillery shells, and fighter jet supplies. However, the production and delivery of some items, such as the heavy bombs, may face delays due to concerns about civilian impacts in Gaza. The State Department has already notified Congress of the proposal. Just five weeks ago, following the Lebanon ceasefire, Biden approved a $680 million arms package for Israel, signaling that additional support was forthcoming. Efforts by liberal Democrats to block arms transfers to Israel were defeated, with strong bipartisan support for Biden’s approach. In his final days, this move underscores the administration’s steadfast commitment to Israel. Biden, who often describes himself as a Zionist, leaves office with this significant gesture of support—a promising sign for the future of bipartisan backing for the Jewish state.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by00bbrq8jl	2025-01-06T20:57:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/06/06/B1gwA7LyHC/B1gwA7LyHC_0_95_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Israelis safe after being stranded in northern Japan blizzard	Rescue team manages to reach the three IDF soldiers after concerns for their health and safety; Japan embassy thanks efforts of local authorities Three young Israelis were rescued after they were stranded since Monday morning on Mount Shirouma, part of the Nagano prefecture in central Japan, suffering from severe hypothermia. A rescue team was able to reach the three and bring them safely down off the mountain where they were met by Israel's ambassador to Japan Gilad Cohen, before being transported to hospital for treatment of frost bites and examination. Harsh weather conditions complicated rescue efforts, and friends in Israel were deeply concerned that the three may not survive the night after they reported that they are 'freezing' and their mobile phone battery was rapidly running out. Israel’s Foreign Ministry, along with the Israeli Embassy in Tokyo and the Magnus rescue company worked diligently to assist in the rescue operation. The three men, all former combat soldiers in the IDF, had traveled to the area for a snowboarding trip. Straying off their designated trail, they became trapped in an area with no viable route forward. The sudden onset of harsh weather left them immobilized and in life-threatening conditions.

Venezuela claims arrested Israeli national allegedly working as U...	Minister announces arrest of 125 suspected mercenaries from 16 countries, including one Israeli national; Israel’s Foreign Ministry says investigating; Venezuela cut ties with Israel in 2009 Venezuelan authorities announced on Monday the arrest of an Israeli national suspected of working as a mercenary for the United States in an alleged plot to stage a coup against the government. Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said that a total of 125 mercenaries from 16 different nationalities had been detained as part of ongoing operations to thwart what the government described as destabilization efforts. According to Cabello, the suspects are nationals of the United States, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Peru, Spain, Italy, Ukraine, Switzerland, Lebanon, Albania, Germany, Yemen, Argentina, Guyana and Israel. Israel's Foreign Ministry confirmed it is investigating the report. The lack of diplomatic relations between Israel and Venezuela—severed in 2009 following Israel's Operation Cast Lead in Gaza—may complicate efforts to obtain more information. Cabello’s statement is the latest in a series of accusations by the Venezuelan government, which has frequently blamed the U.S. for attempting to undermine its leadership. Last year, Venezuelan authorities announced the arrest of three Americans, two Spaniards and a Czech national, alleging they entered the country to assassinate President Nicolás Maduro. Cabello claimed at the time that the individuals were part of a CIA-backed plot to overthrow the government and eliminate senior officials. Venezuela also claimed that one of the arrested Americans had served in the U.S. Navy. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In the past, Maduro has leveraged the detention of U.S. citizens to extract concessions from Washington. Last year, in a deal between the two nations, Maduro released 10 Americans and a fugitive wanted in the United States. In exchange, the U.S. granted clemency to Alex Saab, a close ally of Maduro arrested in Florida on charges of money laundering. U.S. prosecutors allege that Saab assisted Maduro in evading U.S. sanctions. Washington accuses Venezuela of rigging the vote in disputed elections held on July 28 last year and of committing human rights violations. Following the presidential elections, Maduro declared victory, but the opposition claimed it had won by a significant margin. The National Electoral Council refused to release detailed results. Many Western and Latin American countries recognized the opposition's claim and condemned Maduro's government. Since the elections and Maduro's declaration of victory, Venezuela has been gripped by unrest, with hundreds arrested during protests. Despite international condemnation and the lack of transparency from the Electoral Council, Venezuela's Supreme Court—which supports Maduro—confirmed his victory in August. Subsequently, the country's attorney general issued an arrest warrant for opposition leader Juan González, who refused to acknowledge the results and fled to Spain. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hku950yi1g	2025-01-06T13:44:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/15/BJNpNX4T0/BJNpNX4T0_362_113_1460_822_0_small.jpg

The U.S. on Monday issued a sanctions exemption for transactions with governing institutions in Syria for six months after the end of Bashar Assad's rule in an effort to ease the flow of humanitarian assistance. The exemption, known as a general license, also allows some energy transactions and personal remittances to Syria until July 7. The action did not remove any sanctions. Syria suffers from severe power shortages, with state-supplied electricity available just two or three hours per day in most areas. The caretaker government says it aims to provide electricity up to eight hours per day within two months. The U.S. Treasury said the move sought 'to help ensure that sanctions do not impede essential services and continuity of governance functions across Syria, including the provision of electricity, energy, water and sanitation.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skapd0t8ke	2025-01-06T13:26:47-08:00	
Fears mount for Israelis stranded in northern Japan blizzard	Three discharged IDF soldiers stranded on Japan’s snow-covered Mount Shirouma, battling hypothermia; rescue efforts face delays due to severe weather, as Israel’s Foreign Ministry and local authorities work urgently to secure their safe evacuation Three young Israelis have been stranded since Monday morning on Mount Shirouma, part of the Nagano prefecture in central Japan, suffering from severe hypothermia. Harsh weather conditions are complicating rescue efforts, and friends in Israel are deeply concerned they may not survive the night. The stranded men have reported that they are 'freezing' and their mobile phone battery is rapidly running out. The inclement weather in the area has made rescue attempts extremely challenging. Authorities are waiting for conditions to stabilize before deploying a local rescue team. According to a source familiar with the situation, only a Japanese military helicopter would be able to reach the summit and evacuate the group.

Israel signals reticence about incoming UN Middle East envoy	Israel rejects UN’s nomination of Finland’s Pekka Haavisto as Middle East envoy, citing concerns over bias and support for two-state solution; decision adds to tensions with UN as frustrations mount over diplomatic failures Tensions between Israel and the United Nations escalated after Jerusalem rejected UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ proposal to appoint Finland's former foreign minister Pekka Haavisto as the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East. Israel dismissed Haavisto’s nomination and requested alternative candidates, a decision that now awaits Guterres’ next steps, including consultations with the Palestinians and the UN Security Council. Israel reportedly opposes Haavisto’s candidacy due to his close ties with Guterres, his advocacy for a two-state solution, and past criticism of Israeli policies. Officials fear his appointment could exacerbate existing tensions between Israel and the UN. Haavisto, a seasoned diplomat with extensive international experience, has served in various high-stakes roles, including UN investigations in Kosovo and as the EU’s representative in Sudan and Somalia. Haavisto would replace Norwegian diplomat Tor Wennesland, who recently ended his four-year tenure. Wennesland played a crucial role in mediating between Israel and Hamas, notably averting conflicts through humanitarian measures. However, his efforts failed to prevent the October 7 attacks by Hamas, which marked a turning point in his tenure. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Before departing Israel in December, Wennesland candidly criticized the international community’s failure to achieve meaningful political solutions, citing a misplaced focus on short-term humanitarian relief over lasting political resolutions. In an interview with The New York Times, Wennesland admitted misjudging Hamas’ intentions, saying, 'Politics failed. Diplomacy failed. The international community failed. And the parties failed.' His remarks highlighted the growing skepticism among diplomats regarding the feasibility of a two-state solution, warning that such doubts could embolden opponents of Palestinian statehood. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjufhoy81x	2025-01-06T12:55:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/25/ByNJ9XWCR/ByNJ9XWCR_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
2 soldiers killed in northern Gaza battle, one identified	A man of truth and humility': Cpt. Eitan Shiknazi, 24, from Eli, killed by anti-tank missile in Beit Hanoun; IDF fatalities reach 827 since war The IDF announced Monday evening that Captain Eitan Israel Shiknazi, 24, from the settlement of Eli, was killed in combat in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza. Shiknazi, a deputy company commander in the Nahal Brigade and a former Egoz Unit commando, was struck by an anti-tank missile. Another soldier was killed in the same incident, though his name has not yet been released. Two additional soldiers from the 932nd Battalion were seriously wounded and are receiving medical care, with their families notified. Since the start of the war, IDF casualties have risen to 827, with hundreds more wounded. Shiknazi, a graduate of the Bnei David pre-army academy and the 10th soldier from Eli to fall in the war, was mourned by his local community. Binyamin Regional Council head Yisrael Gantz described him as a heroic leader. 'Eitan lived and died with dedication to his people and land. In this difficult hour, we embrace his wife, Hallel, his parents, and the entire family. All of Israel grieves with you.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Born in Hazor HaGlilit, where his parents still reside, Shiknazi was remembered as a symbol of courage and dedication. 'We have lost one of our best,' Hazor HaGlilit Mayor Michael Kabesa said. 'Eitan was a fourth-generation resident of Hazor, a fearless fighter, devoted husband and beloved son who gave his all to defend our country.' Educational leaders who knew Shiknazi described him as a natural leader, dedicated student and compassionate soul. 'Eitan was a man of truth and humility, passionate about learning Torah and a shining example of moral integrity,' said Boaz Yossefi, principal of Amit Hazor. The ongoing violence in Gaza has claimed numerous lives among Israeli forces. Last week, Sergeant Uriel Peretz, 23, from Beitar Illit, was killed by an anti-tank missile in Beit Hanoun, with seven others injured, three severely. He was laid to rest on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. The day prior, Staff Sergeant Yuval Shoham, 22, from Jerusalem, a tank operator in the 9th Battalion of the Iron Tracks Brigade, was killed during a Givati Brigade assault in Jabaliya.

Two weeks before inauguration, Trump warns of ‘hell’ over hostage...	US president-elect reiterates ultimatum to Hamas; criticizing Biden for inaction, Trump promised decisive measures to secure their release U.S. President-elect Donald Trump reiterated his warning Monday that if hostages held in Gaza are not released by his inauguration on January 20, there will be 'all hell to pay.' Speaking on conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt's show, Trump criticized outgoing President Joe Biden, saying he would not rely on words like 'DON'T' but instead on decisive action, referencing Biden’s warning to Hezbollah and Iran after the October 7 massacre, where he used the word 'DON’T' to caution against their involvement in the war. When asked to elaborate on his warning, Trump said, 'Exactly what it says. If those hostages aren’t released by the time I get to office, there will be hell to pay. I don’t think I have to go into it anymore. It won’t be the word 'don’t'... There will be hell to pay. Those hostages have to get out. They have to get out now. Trump emphasized his strong alliance with Israel, saying, 'I’m the best friend that Israel ever had. You look at what happened with all of the things that I’ve gotten, including Jerusalem being the capital, the embassy getting built. I got it built. And of course, the Abraham Accords. Every major event that’s happened to Israel over the last fairly short period of time has been given through me. So I’m with Israel. I think that’s pretty obvious to everybody.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Last month, Trump claimed he was working behind the scenes to assist Israel and secure the hostages’ release. 'We’ve been working hard to help Israel and the Middle East,' he said in a press conference, adding that he had spoken with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the situation. 'We had a very good conversation about what’s to come. I’ll be ready on January 20, and if the hostages aren’t home by then, hell’s gates will open, and it will be very strong.' Analysts suggest Trump’s ambiguous phrasing may hint at a reluctance to fully restart a large-scale conflict if a cease-fire takes hold before his inauguration. Hamas could interpret this dynamic as favorable, believing that a Trump administration may accept a non-active war state in Gaza rather than escalate the situation. Meanwhile, Israeli forces are reportedly preparing for intensified operations across Gaza if a deal for the hostages is not reached. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkidu3f8yx	2025-01-06T12:04:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/13/ryD00G8fG1g/ryD00G8fG1g_0_82_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
US Congress certifies Trump election victory with Harris presidin...	Democratic candidate concedes loss with call to uphold democratic norms; certification marks peaceful transfer of power amid heightened security The U.S. Congress formally certified Republican President-elect Donald Trump's election victory on Monday during a session presided over by Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost the November contest. The quadrennial ritual, clearing the way for Trump's inauguration in two weeks, went like clockwork and stood in sharp contrast to four years ago when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to block the certification of then-President Trump's 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden. Trump continues to claim that his 2020 defeat was the result of widespread fraud, and had warned throughout his 2024 campaign that he harbored similar concerns until his Nov. 5 defeat of Harris. Harris oversaw the roll call of the states in the vice president's ceremonial role as president of the Senate. Known for her broad smiles and upbeat demeanor in public appearances, she stood stoic with hands clasped on the dais as she handed off certificates of each state's electoral votes for Trump and herself. 'Today was obviously a very important day, and it was about what should be the norm and what the American people should be able to take for granted, which is that one of the most important pillars of our democracy is that there will be a peaceful transfer of power,' Harris told reporters at the Capitol. 'I do believe very strongly that American democracy is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it.' Four years ago, then-Vice President Mike Pence had to preside over Biden's victory. In 2001, then-Vice President Al Gore had the same dubious distinction following a bitter battle between him and George W. Bush that ended so close that the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately had to put a stop to the legal challenges, leading to Bush being declared the winner. Sitting in the House chamber was Senator JD Vance, whose vice presidential victory was also certified by Harris. Vance stood and waved to the members in the chamber when his electoral vote total was announced. 'Congress certifies our great election victory today - a big moment in history. MAGA!' Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social earlier on Monday. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The joint session of Congress proceeded even as a winter storm hovered over the nation's capital, dropping about 6 inches (15 cm) of snow and snarling travel. The final certification backed up preliminary findings that Trump won 312 Electoral College votes to Harris's 226. Republicans control White House, Congress Republicans also captured a majority in the U.S. Senate and held a narrow edge in the House in November's election, which will give Trump the party support he needs to implement his planned agenda of tax cuts and a crackdown on immigrants living in the country illegally. Democrats did not try to block the certification of Trump's victory on Monday. 'We must renew our commitment to safeguarding American democracy,' No. 2 House Democrat Katherine Clark said in a statement earlier in the day. 'As elected leaders, our loyalty must be to the Constitution, first and always. We are here to honor the will of the people and the rule of law.' Security inside and outside the Capitol was heightened in preparation for the certification and was expected to remain in place through Trump's swearing-in on Jan. 20. The Capitol grounds were ringed by metal fences hundreds of yards from the U.S. Capitol, and accessible only via checkpoints guarded by uniformed police officers. Convoys of black police vehicles were on hand, led by a 10-wheel Baltimore police mobile command center. New York Police Department reinforcements were also patrolling the area. Inside, extra teams of uniformed U.S. Capitol Police officers were checking IDs at entrance sites including doors and underground tunnels leading to the House and Senate chambers. Trump has said he plans to pardon some of the more than 1,500 people charged with taking part in the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol, when a mob fought with police, smashing its way in through windows and doors and chanting, 'Hang Mike Pence,' referring to Trump's then-vice president, in a failed bid to stop Congress from certifying Biden's victory. In the 2021 melee at the Capitol, rioters surged past police barricades, assaulting about 140 officers and causing more than $2.8 million in damage. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hybr9hf8kl	2025-01-06T11:32:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/06/ryxlGiFLJl/ryxlGiFLJl_0_23_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF wary of retreat amid Lebanese army stalled action in southern...	While US Mideast envoy Hochstein affirms full IDF withdrawal from southern Lebanon, Israeli officials hint at extending presence if Lebanese armed forces fail to meet cease-fire obligations The Lebanese Army announced on Monday it has begun deploying forces in the town of Naqoura in southern Lebanon. This development comes after reports in Lebanon claimed that Israeli forces have withdrawn from the area. While IDF officials are reportedly considering extending their presence in Lebanon beyond the timeframe stipulated in the cease-fire agreement, U.S. Middle East envoy Amos Hochstein clarified during his visit to Beirut: 'IDF will withdraw from all Lebanese territory.' Hochstein, following a meeting with Lebanese Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, stated, 'IDF has begun withdrawing from Naqoura in southern Lebanon, and will withdraw from all Lebanese territory. Implementing the agreement in southern Lebanon is not easy, but we are committed to supporting the Lebanese Army.' According to Lebanon’s LBCI news outlet, a convoy of Lebanese Army and UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) troops entered Naqoura for the first time since the cease-fire agreement was established. A subsequent statement by the Lebanese Army confirmed that its forces had taken positions around the town of Naqoura and begun deploying in coordination with UNIFIL and the Five-Nation Monitoring Committee overseeing the cease-fire. The Lebanese Army noted, 'The deployment occurred simultaneously with the Israeli enemy’s withdrawal from the town.' During Hochstein’s meeting with former Lebanese President Michel Aoun, U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Lisa Johnson was also present. Reports from the Saudi news channel Al-Arabiya quoted Lebanese Army sources stating that Hochstein supported the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon. The Lebanese Army reportedly informed Hochstein that full deployment along the border would only be possible once Israel completed its withdrawal. According to Lebanon’s MTV news agency, Hochstein told Aoun that efforts are currently underway to facilitate the withdrawal of IDF troops from villages in southern Lebanon before the 60-day deadline expires. However, Aoun argued that the Lebanese Army’s ability to fully implement the agreement remains hindered by the continued Israeli presence in these villages. Israeli actions raise concerns over cease-fire deadline Meanwhile, reports from Lebanon describe ongoing Israeli military activity in the south. The Qatari newspaper The New Arab reported the IDF demolished several homes and buildings in the town of Al-Jibeen. Similarly, the Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar claimed it had carried out bulldozing operations along Hamra Road, near a Lebanese military post, before advancing toward the village of Al-Mateet. Additionally, an Israeli Merkava tank reportedly targeted a house near the village of Ainata. The end of this month marks the expiration of the 60-day period stipulated in the cease-fire agreement with Hezbollah for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon. However, IDF has already stated it is not etched in stone. According to Al-Akhbar, a Lebanese military source accused Israel of gradually introducing new rules of engagement and attempting to solidify its freedom of movement as a permanent reality, even beyond the cease-fire period. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The source added that Lebanese military officials received indications from Jesper Jørgensen, head of the cease-fire monitoring mechanism in Lebanon, that Israel intends to extend the cease-fire period from 60 to 90 days. This extension, according to the Lebanese newspaper, would depend on Israel achieving key objectives, including ensuring that Hezbollah is unable to initiate attacks. Israeli military officials are currently considering the possibility of remaining in Lebanon beyond the cease-fire deadline. However, no final decision has been made. IDF is preparing for this option, explaining that the decision depends on Lebanon’s actions and whether its military can establish full control over southern Lebanon. Israel is hopeful that the U.S. will understand their position, emphasizing that withdrawing on time without Lebanon meeting its obligations would be problematic. It is likely the incoming Trump administration will work to prevent the collapse of the cease-fire arrangement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk1w59yi1x	2025-01-06T10:38:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/06/Sk6q00FYU1e/Sk6q00FYU1e_0_0_900_506_0_small.jpg
Minute-by-minute: Chilling details of deadly West Bank attack	3 gunmen open fire on cars and buses near Kedumim, killing police officer Elad Winkelstein, Rachel Cohen and Aliza Reiss; PM Netanyahu and IDF chief Halevi vow swift action Three Israelis, including a police officer and two women, were killed, and 11 others injured in a terror attack Monday morning near the Palestinian village of Al-Funduq, close to the settlement of Kedumim in the West Bank. The attackers, traveling in a car, opened fire on passing vehicles and buses along Highway 55 before fleeing toward Nablus. 9:10 a.m.: A vehicle carrying three assailants arrives from the west on Highway 55 in the Palestinian village of Al-Funduq. The attackers make a U-turn and wait in the car as other vehicles pass. 9:11 a.m.: The vehicle aligns with the traffic flow, positioning itself for the attack. 9:12 a.m.: The assailants exit the car and begin shooting at passing vehicles. Rachel Cohen and Aliza Reiss are shot at point-blank range from multiple directions and killed. The attackers also open fire on Elad Winkelstein’s vehicle. Winkelstein, traveling with his son, returns fire and attempts to flee with his child. 9:13 a.m.: The attackers fire at two buses passing through the area. One of the buses is bulletproof, mitigating casualties. 9:14 a.m.: A bystander, Ammi Barber, opens fire at the attackers but is unable to neutralize them. 9:15 a.m.: The assailants re-enter their vehicle and flee along Highway 55 toward Nablus. The IDF has launched a manhunt, sealing off nearby villages and conducting intelligence operations to locate the suspects and their accomplices. At least two of the assailants are known to Israeli security forces and are believed to be linked to Jenin and Qabatiya in the northern West Bank. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held an emergency meeting with defense officials, approving measures to apprehend the attackers and enhance security in the region. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi visited the scene, vowing to capture those responsible.

Canada PM Justin Trudeau says he will step down	Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation on Monday, telling the nation that 'internal battles' mean he 'cannot be the best option' in the next election. Trudeau said he has asked the president of his Liberal Party to begin the process of selecting a new leader. He has faced rising discontent over his leadership, and the abrupt departure of his finance minister late last year signaled growing turmoil within his government. Parliament will be suspended until March 24. It had been due to resume on Jan. 27. The timing will allow for a Liberal Party leadership race. Trudeau had been the second-youngest prime minister in Canada's history when he was elected in 2015, and he had been planning to run for a fourth term in next year's election even as discontent in his party grew. He said 'I have always been driven by my love for Canada' and repeatedly described himself as a fighter.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj7zc9tijg	2025-01-06T09:01:21-08:00	
France holds Algerian influencers on charges of urging violence	Two of 3 suspects facing terror charges for inciting violence in TikTok videos, amid rising France-Algeria tensions; influencers 'Imad Tintin' and 'Zazou Youssef' posted videos advocating attacks in France, prompting arrests and potential expulsions French authorities on Sunday held three Algerians suspected of inciting violence in TikTok videos, with at least two of them facing terror-related charges. The arrests come amid growing political tensions between Paris and its former North African colony. The three posted their videos on accounts named Sofia Benlemmane, Abdesslam Bazooka and Laksas06. A video blogger known as 'Imad Tintin' was arrested Friday outside Grenoble after publishing a video urging followers to 'burn alive, kill and rape on French territory.' The post was taken down after receiving 800,000 views but hardline right-wing Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau published a video grab on his social media accounts, condemning the publication as 'vile.' A judge on Sunday placed the 31-year-old blogger under judicial supervision, Grenoble prosecutors said. He was due to appear Monday in a fast-track trial on charges of 'direct incitement of an act of terrorism,' the state prosecution service said. 'Imad Tintin' entered France in December 2021 and applied for a residence permit in August 2023 after his marriage to a French woman. But his application was refused and he is also subject to an expulsion order. In a second case, a 25-year-old Algerian identified as Youcef A. but known on social media as Zazou Youssef was remanded in custody Friday in the western city of Brest, prosecutor Camille Miansoni said in a statement. He will stand trial there on February 24 on a charge of 'publicly advocating an act of terrorism' in posts to his hundreds of thousands of TikTok followers, she said. He faces up to seven years in jail and a 100,000-euro ($103,000) fine if convicted, the statement added. Zazou Youssef appeared in a video posted on TikTok on December 31, calling for attacks in France and violence in Algeria. He was living in France on a temporary residency permit. TikTok told AFP the account from which the video was posted had been banned for posting several videos that broke its rules on hate speech. Prosecutors announced the arrests of Imad Tintin and Yousseff on Friday and Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau on Sunday announced a third arrest.

Prosecutors told AFP local authorities had reported a video in which the influencer said of the activist: 'Kill him, let him suffer.' The regional prefect's office told AFP it was considering withdrawing that blogger's residence permit and issuing an expulsion order. Tensions have surged between France and Algeria after President Emmanuel Macron renewed French support for Moroccan sovereignty over the disputed territory of Western Sahara during a landmark visit to the kingdom last year. Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony, is mostly under the de facto control of Morocco. But it is claimed by the Sahrawi separatists of the Polisario Front, who are demanding a self-determination referendum and are supported by Algiers. French-Algerian novelist Boualem Sansal, a major figure in modern francophone literature, has meanwhile been imprisoned by the Algerian authorities since mid-November on national security charges. Mentioning Sansal's case on Sunday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said he had 'doubts' over Algeria's commitment to a roadmap set out by the two sides in 2022 to smooth post-colonial relations. 'Zazou Youssef' and 'Imad Tintin' have joined 'the war waged in France by the Algerian regime,' Chawki Benzehra, an Algerian dissident, told AFP. Benzehra took refuge in France after taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations in 2019. He accused the Algerian authorities of mobilizing a 'significant' number of influencers calling for 'violence.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1fnyffikl	2025-01-06T08:04:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/06/BJTvPHKI1l/BJTvPHKI1l_0_64_390_220_0_small.jpg

Tehran says detention of Iranian in Italy amounts to 'hostage-tak...	Iran slams Rome over detention of Iranian suspect accused of involvement in drone strike against US forces in Jordan Iran said on Monday the detention of an Iranian national in Italy at the request of the U.S. amounted to hostage-taking. Iranian businessman Mohammad Abedini was detained in Milan last month. He is wanted by the U.S. on suspicion of involvement in a drone strike against U.S. forces in Jordan. Iran has denied involvement. His arrest has been linked to the detention three days later of Italian reporter Cecilia Sala, who was seized in Tehran on Dec. 19 while working under a regular journalistic visa. 'We regard the pursuit or extradition of Iranian nationals in certain countries as a form of hostage-taking,' Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei told reporters. 'The main accusation against them is circumvention of unilateral U.S. sanctions,' he said in a televised news conference in Tehran. 'Fabricating a judicial cover to trap Iranian nationals is illegal, immoral, and a violation of human rights.' Asked if Sala's detention was linked to Abedini's arrest in Italy, Baghaei said: 'These matters are not related in any way.' Abedini was detained at Milan's Malpensa airport on a U.S. warrant for allegedly supplying drone parts that Washington says were used in the 2023 attack that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan. Abedini is currently being held in prison and a court is due to decide this month whether to grant him house arrest while judges consider the U.S. extradition request.

Elad Yaakov Winkelstein fired shots at the terrorists before being hit by a fatal bullet in front of his son Aliza Reiss and Rachel Cohen were identified as two of the victims murdered in the West Bank terror attack on Monday. Earlier Master Sgt. Elad Yaakov Winkelstein was identified as well. The three were victims of the murderous attack by a terror squad near the settlement of Kedumim. The terrorists opened fire on a bus and private vehicles on route 55 before escaping the scene. A manhunt was underway. Cohen and Reiss were both educators who lived in Kedumim. Cohen was 73, a retired school counselor. She was survived by her husband and five daughters. Naomi, her daughter said her mother was full of joy, positive energies and a giving person. 'She was God fearing and an active and loved grandmother,' Naomi said. 'She was who we went to for everything. A loving mother and wife and a special and moving person.'

Rising concerns about immigrants violence and political correctne...	Ynet’s Ze'ev discusses how political correctness hinders action. He notes that authorities’ reluctance stems from fear of stigmatizing immigrant groups while growing safety concerns fuel right-wing movements As Europe continues to address the troubling rise of crimes committed by certain immigrants and public safety concerns, we spoke with Ynet's correspondent based in Berlin, Ze'ev Avrahami, to explore the underlying issues and the role political correctness may play in hindering effective action by authorities. Why do you think these issues are often overlooked or underreported by authorities across Europe, including in Sweden, Germany, and France? First, let’s reflect on what occurred in the UK. This wasn’t an isolated problem—it happened in numerous places, and the scope and graphic details of the crimes are truly horrifying. But this isn’t confined to the UK; it’s a Europe-wide issue. If we examine the UK reports and investigations, it becomes evident that there was systemic negligence. Parents, institutions, the judicial system, and law enforcement all failed the victims—primarily white British girls from working-class backgrounds, aged 11 to 18. Meanwhile, the perpetrators were predominantly British citizens of Pakistani descent, aged 30 to 40. What’s even more distressing is that everyone knew what was happening. How much of a role does political correctness play in preventing authorities from addressing crimes committed by certain immigrant groups? It plays the central role. The reluctance to address these crimes stems from a fear of being labeled as targeting immigrants, particularly those from Pakistani Muslim backgrounds. Cultural factors also play into this—some of these groups view women as property or objects, regardless of whether they are 11 or 25 years old. The age and scope of the crimes make them particularly shocking, but the underlying issue is a reluctance to acknowledge the problem. Do you believe people in countries like the UK, France, and Sweden are growing frustrated with political correctness? Absolutely, but it’s a byproduct of deeper issues. Take Sweden, for example. It has long been considered a model of liberal democracy, with a strong welfare system and economy. Yet, today, 20% of Swedes are voting for a party with neo-Nazi roots. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: This shift is largely due to concerns over personal safety. Many Europeans no longer feel secure—whether it’s walking the streets at night or in certain neighborhoods. These fears are driving people toward the right wing, which poses significant dangers in Europe, given its history. To combat this, governments must address these concerns rather than dismiss them as overblown. There is a problem, and it needs to be taken seriously. So, in your view, this fear and frustration are key drivers behind the rise of right-wing movements across Europe? Without a doubt. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sypl1ntukg	2025-01-06T04:14:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/08/04/B1v1zgTF0/B1v1zgTF0_0_96_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
What can be learned from the list of hostages that may be release...	The 34 hostages that Hamas claimed it would release, whether alive or dead, in the humanitarian exchange, are the same named in an Israeli demand presented to mediators last July International media outlets published a list of 34 hostages on Monday morning, that they said was given to them by Hamas which includes 22 elderly men, 10 women, and two young children, Ariel and Kfir Bibas. According to Israeli officials, it is the list that Israel presented to mediators last July with the demand that they be among the first freed. Hamas now claims it is willing to release all 34 hostages Israel demanded, though it has not said who among them was alive and what their condition was. Hamas asserts that to verify the condition of the hostages, it requires a ceasefire of at least a week, to investigate their status. In contrast, Israel insists that Hamas must release some hostages as a 'good faith' gesture before the ceasefire begins, allowing the terror group time to find out the condition of the others. Officials also denied that any confirmation from Hamas regarding the identity of hostages to be freed, has been received. The publication of this list, one day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office categorically denied its existence, appears to be another move by Hamas to pressure Israel in the negotiations. The list, as of now, identifies 34 hostages under consideration for release as part of a humanitarian exchange. Notably, it excludes male soldiers and many young hostages, along with those officially declared dead by Israel, including Judy Weinstein, Inbar Hyman, and Ofra Kedar. As long as Israel does not agree to a full ceasefire, Hamas is expected to continue refusing to release the remaining 66 hostages not on the list, 34 of whom have been declared dead. The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said on Sunday that Israel had not received any acknowledgment or response from Hamas regarding the hostages’ conditions. 'Israel will continue to work tirelessly to bring home all of our hostages,' they stated. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Hostage and Missing Persons Directorate, led by Gal Hirsch, updated the families of the hostages about the list published today in the media. 'This is a 'humanitarian' list that Israel handed to mediators months ago, containing names of women, children, elderly over 50, sick, and wounded,' the directorate stated. 'Hamas has not responded to the status of those listed. Negotiations continue, and we are doing everything to bring back all hostages, both the living and the deceased.' The directorate also urged the public and the media to act responsibly and avoid publishing names or rumors that could harm families or the effort to secure the hostages’ return. The list, divided into four categories, includes a variety of hostages, some of whom are women, children, and elderly individuals. In the first category, there are seven women and children who are slated for release as part of the deal. These individuals are Roni Gonen, 24; Emily Damari, 28; Arbel Yehoud, 29; Doron Steinbrecher, 31; Ariel Bibas, 5; Kfir Bibas, 1; and Shiri Silberman Bibas, 33. The second category consists of five female soldiers who were kidnapped from the Nahal Oz outpost. These are Liri Albag, 19; Karina Ariev, 20; Agam Berger, 20; Daniela Gilboa, 20; and Naama Levy, 20. The third category lists eleven men aged 50 to 85. They are Ohad Ben-Ami, 55; Gad Moshe Moses, 80; Keith Shmuel Siegel, 65; Ofer Kalderon, 53; Eliyahu Sharabi, 52; Itzhak Elgaret, 69; Shlomo Mansur, 86; Ohad Yahalomi, 50; Yousef Yousef Alziadna, 54; Oded Lifshitz, 84; and Tsachi Idan, 50.

HFR seeks charges against IDF soldier in Thailand	Palestinian group looking for legal representation to go after troops visiting the country; Foreign Ministry mulls response to threats, issues warnings and advise to avoid danger The Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) was looking for legal representation to file complaints against Israeli soldiers vacationing in Thailand accusing them of war crimes. The group filed a first complaint recently against one such soldier. Foreign Minister Gideon Saar summoned a meeting on Sunday dealing with how to protect Jews and Israelis abroad. The discussion was held after the minister's involvement in the attempted arrest of the soldier in Brazil and his consequent escape. It was the first in a series of planned meetings, and it dealt with improving cooperation between all agencies to deal with the issue. The discussion dealt with a complaint lodged by HRF in the Brazilian federal court against an IDF soldier who was visiting the country. The court ordered the police to begin an investigation into alleged war crimes committed by the soldier during the war in Gaza. From the perspective of the Israeli authorities, managing such an event includes three stages: monitoring, assessing, and understanding the extent of the danger in traveling abroad. During the discussion, Saar instructed the participants to formulate procedures for similar cases and instructed the IDF to brief the soldiers and forbid them from posting any operational activities. Minister Sa'ar also instructed to establish a hotline for inquiries from soldiers and civilians. Sa'ar also instructed to monitor organizations that operate against IDF soldiers abroad. Since the October 7 massacre, there have been 12 cases of soldiers who have been legally persecuted around the world. Based on the details, it was learned that in the second half of 2024 there was a 63% increase in online antisemitic incidents, and a 104% increase in physical antisemitic incidents. The main danger posed to IDF soldiers in countries with a hostile stance towards Israel, including Ireland, Brazil, Spain, Belgium and South Africa. Since the beginning of the war, proceedings have been opened against IDF soldiers in the following countries: Morocco, Norway, Belgium, Cyprus, Sri Lanka, the Netherlands, Brazil, Thailand, Ireland, Serbia, France and South Africa, although in all those cases, the proceedings were the result of appeals to the legal authorities and not the initiative of the local governments. The discussion also revealed that IDF soldiers were smuggled under the radar from at least five countries. However, but no arrest warrant has been issued against IDF soldiers in any country. Anti-Israel organizations such as the Hind Rajab Foundation and the March 30th Movement have requested such warrants, but have failed in every country. Behind this activity are activists linked to Samidoun, which has been designated as a terrorist organization by Israel. The Hind Rajab Foundation claims to have provided the International Criminal Court in The Hague details of a thousand IDF soldiers. The foundation was established in February last year by several Palestinians living in Brussels in memory of the 6-year-old Palestinian girl Hind Rajab, who they claim was killed by IDF forces on January 29 last year along with all her family members while they were in their car. The main problem is the fact that IDF soldiers post incriminating videos on social media, in which they record themselves carrying out activities in Gaza and Lebanon. The soldiers also post their travel plans on their platforms. The foundation collects the videos, verifies them with additional data, and contacts governments when those soldiers travel abroad according to their social media. The IDF has trouble enforcing the social media ban on operational activities. However, most cases include reservists who ignore orders. Political sources said this phenomenon will only get worse. The Hind Rajab Foundation has so far published the names of the soldiers, giving Israel enough time to rescue the soldier. In the case of Brazil, they learned their lesson, filed the complaint, and the federal court reached the decision without reporting his name. Ultimately, the foundation's announcement was enough for Israel to locate the soldier and rescue him and his friends from Brazil. Not all countries are hostile and dangerous for IDF soldiers. Israel is in contact with friendly countries, such as Hungary, the Czech Republic and Italy, which most likely will not allow pro-Palestinian organizations to concoct their arrest.

In the Netherlands, wanted notices were even posted against IDF soldiers with local citizenship who returned to the country. No one is immune, and every young person who travels abroad must be careful everywhere. What can be done? First of all, delete all videos on the Internet that could incriminate you. In addition, before traveling, it is worth checking whether you are at risk of arrest. Keeping a low profile can help and there is no need to report where you are traveling. You can wait with the posting about your trip until after returning to Israel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyr1amt8je	2025-01-06T01:26:13-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/28/H1aUfgL71g/H1aUfgL71g_0_170_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Hamas fired at Israeli communities for nine consecutive days since last week and on Saturday, a mortar shell exploded near the Erez border crossing where trucks carrying humanitarian aid into the Strip, were waiting to pass. Some damage to the crossing was reported. The IDF said on Sunday that a member of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) who was the deputy commander of the rocket units in northern Gaza was killed in a targeted attack. According to the military he had participated in the October 7 massacre and carried out attacks on IDF troops in the Strip.

No hostages will be freed until the Gaza war ends’	Gershon Baskin: ‘There’s very little the international community can do to pressure Hamas to make a deal’ All of the Israeli hostages will not return home unless the war in Gaza ends, according to social and political activist Gershon Baskin. 'There’s very little the international community can do to pressure Hamas to make a deal,' Baskin told ILTV. 'Hamas’s main interest is to end the war, and they’ve been saying this for months.' Baskin highlighted that it remains unclear if Hamas would be willing to relinquish governmental control of Gaza. He emphasized that this issue must be addressed politically, not just militarily. 'The issue of Hamas’s weapons and troops is still undefined, and this is something that Israel has refused to address,' Baskin claimed. 'It must be dealt with at the political level, not only the military level, if we want a deal that will bring back all the hostages. All the hostages will not come back until the war is over.' Baskin spoke to ILTV shortly before a Hamas source told Reuters news agency that it had approved a list of 34 hostages for exchange and presented it to Israel. However, the Prime Minister’s Office denied the report.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkiiqzkiyl	2025-01-05T23:57:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/04/HJnTNbwLkg/HJnTNbwLkg_0_93_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Ágnes Keleti, Jewish Olympic legend, passes away at 103	Keleti made her Olympic debut at age 31, earning one gold and three additional medals The date for the funeral of Hungarian-Israeli Olympic champion Ágnes Keleti in Budapest has yet to be announced. A Holocaust survivor and the world’s oldest Olympic champion, Keleti passed away just one week shy of her 104th birthday. Widely regarded as one of the greatest Jewish athletes of all time, Keleti leaves behind an unparalleled legacy. As Hungary’s most decorated female Olympian, she achieved sporting excellence despite the immense challenges of her youth. Keleti lost her father in the Holocaust and survived by assuming a false identity and working as a maid in the home of a Nazi-sympathizing family. The war and a severe injury kept her from competing during her athletic prime. However, Keleti made her Olympic debut at age 31, earning one gold and three additional medals. Four years later, at the 1956 Melbourne Games, she captured four gold and two silver medals at the age of 35. During the Melbourne Games, the Soviet Union invaded Hungary, prompting Keleti to emigrate to Israel. She devoted her post-competitive career to developing Israeli gymnastics, teaching physical education at the Wingate Institute for 34 years, and coaching the national team until the 1990s. In 2017, Keleti was awarded the Israel Prize for her lifetime contributions to Israeli sport. Ágnes Keleti spent her later years nurturing the next generation of athletes, leaving an indelible mark on the global gymnastics community and Israeli sports development.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk25tmku1l	2025-01-05T23:54:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/06/ry3M5GKUJg/ry3M5GKUJg_0_78_492_277_0_small.jpg

Musk mingles in European politics, angering governments	Instigating against the UK, EU, Germany and other officials, world's richest man stirs controversy amid potential role in Trump's government and fostering connections with far-right leaders Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and a close ally of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, has been causing a stir in Europe in recent weeks. He has demanded new elections in the UK, expressed support for Germany’s far-right party, criticized its chancellor and voiced opposition to the European Union — all of this even before Trump’s inauguration. Musk’s support for far-right figures in Europe and his criticism of moderate governments have left European leaders wondering how to deal with him. Musk wields significant influence. As the owner of the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, he’s considered a close confidant of Trump and is set to hold an official role in the new U.S. administration. Recently, Musk has been making frequent comments about European politics, where governments are attempting to combat the rise of populists and far-right leaders — figures whom Musk openly supports. At times, he shares unverified content on his platform. '[Keir] Starmer must go and he must face charges for his complicity in the worst mass crime in the history of Britain,' Musk said about the British Prime Minister. The statement referred to a grave case of child sexual abuse committed by men of Pakistani origin, which authorities allegedly covered up during Starmer’s tenure as England and Wales’s chief prosecutor. Over the past few days, Musk has repeatedly commented on the matter and posted numerous posts about on social media. UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting responded by saying that Musk’s accusations were false and unfounded. In a series of tweets, after the issue resurfaced in the headlines, Musk claimed that Jess Phillips, the minister responsible for preventing violence against women and girls, 'deserves to be in prison' for refusing to investigate allegations of sexual exploitation in Oldham. Phillips clarified that the decision to investigate was the responsibility of Oldham’s city council. Musk alleged that Phillips’ refusal was aimed at shielding Starmer from prosecution. Streeting dismissed these claims as 'shameful defamation.' Musk has also called for the release of Tommy Robinson, a prominent far-right activist in the UK, and expressed support for the Reform UK party, which opposes immigration. He recently met with Nigel Farage, the party’s leader. UK media outlets have speculated whether Musk’s support for Farage’s party, which is currently considered a fringe political force, signals an intention to donate money to the party and help it compete for power against the Labor and Conservative parties. In a surprising turn, Musk called on Farage, one of the leading figures behind the Brexit campaign, to step down as party leader on Sunday. 'The party needs a new leader—Farage doesn’t have what it takes,' Musk wrote on X. Musk’s criticism of Farage followed the politician’s distancing himself from Musk’s support for Tommy Robinson. The British government is working to combat the spread of fake news on social media and Musk compared these efforts to actions taken by the authoritative regime of Soviet Russia. During the summer, amid heated far-right protests against migrants, Musk claimed that civil war in the UK was inevitable. Musk has also called for new elections in the UK, less than six months after a general election resulted in a landslide victory for the left. 'New elections are necessary,' he said, urging King Charles to dissolve Parliament in London. Beyond the UK, Musk has cultivated relationships with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a prominent far-right leader and outspoken opponent of immigration and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whom many consider a far-right figure. Meloni has described Musk as a 'genius.' Musk criticized the annulment of election results in Romania, where a far-right candidate had won. Judges invalidated the results, citing a Russian influence campaign. Musk called the judges 'dictators.' In Germany, Musk voiced support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, claiming it’s the only political force capable of 'saving' the country. He’s scheduled a live discussion with AfD leader Alice Weidel on X. Musk also called for German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to resign after a vehicle-ramming attack at a Christmas market, referring to Scholz as a 'fool.' Scholz dismissed Musk’s personal attacks but expressed concern over his support for a party advocating closer ties with Russia and a weakening of transatlantic relations. 'There are many people on social media seeking attention through extreme rhetoric. I don’t believe we should chase after Musk, and I’m happy to leave that to others. The rule is: don’t feed the troll,' Scholz added. In light of Musk’s support for the AfD, the German government accused him of meddling in the electoral system, while opposition leaders also criticized him. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Musk has also targeted the European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, advocating for increased authority for the European Parliament. Musk argued that the Commission is an undemocratic body. His remarks came as the EU is attempting to curb the spread of misinformation on social media and implement regulations governing content on X. In December, researchers from the European Council on Foreign Relations warned that Musk might exploit his social media platform to 'mobilize citizens and far-right parties in an effort to raise the political costs for decision-makers in Brussels,' who aim to regulate content on X. Former EU Commissioner Vera Jourova described Musk in October as a 'promoter of evil.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byzhpdul1e	2025-01-05T22:11:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/26/S1Edo57Qmyx/S1Edo57Qmyx_0_232_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

British broadcaster says obtained list from Hamas that does not specify who among the captives was alive and who wad dead; Saudi channel posts names, ages of hostages it claims Hamas provides Among the 34 names of hostages Hamas claims to include in the first phase of their release, if a deal is reached, are 10 women 11 people over the age of 50 and 2 children, the BBC reported on Monday. Hamas did not specify who among those listed were alive. The children include the two little babies of the Bibas family, Ariel and Kfir who were said to have been killed although Hamas provided no proof of their deaths. There are 10 women, 11 people between the ages of 55 and 85 and two small children among the 34 hostages Hamas was willing to release in the first stage of the deal being negotiated in Qatar, the BBC said on Monday. The British broadcaster said it had obtained the list of hostages to be freed in the humanitarian release but was not told who among those listed were dead and who were alive. The list includes Ariel and Kfir Bibas, which Hamas said had been killed in an Israeli strike in November of 2023 along with their mother Shiri, although the terrorists did not provide any evidence. The father Yarden is still being held in Gaza. Also on the list are hostages that Hamas defined as 'sick.' The Saud Asharq network posted a full list that includes names and ages but the list cannot be verified. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office (PMO) said in a statement on Sunday that no list has been received by Israel yet, though the Hamas official clarified that the list was merely 'approved.' According to reports, Israel insists on the release of at least 24 live hostages and has therefore requested that Hamas also release injured male hostages under 50 years old on humanitarian grounds. Reports also suggest not all individuals listed as hostages are necessarily alive. A Hamas official told Reuters news agency on Sunday that any agreement to return hostages would depend on a deal for Israel to withdraw from Gaza and a permanent ceasefire or end to the war. 'However, until now, the occupation continues to be obstinate over an agreement over the issues of the ceasefire and withdrawal, and has made no step forward,' the official who was not identified, said.

Move expected to ease supply of basic assistance to Damascus; West cautiously hoping for greater stability in Syria, a decade after the war triggered a major refugee crisis that shook up European politics. The Biden administration plans to announce Monday that it will ease restrictions on humanitarian aid for Syria, speeding delivery of basic supplies without lifting sanctions that restrict other assistance to the new government in Damascus, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. The step, approved by the administration over the weekend, authorizes the Treasury Department to issue waivers to aid groups and companies providing essentials such as water, electricity and other humanitarian supplies, the WSJ reported citing officials. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet his European counterparts Thursday in Rome on Syria, as the West looks to engage the new Islamist-led leadership. The State Department did not immediately specify the participants. Blinken, on a trip that will also take him to Japan and France, will later join President Joe Biden as he pays a farewell visit to Rome that includes an audience with Pope Francis. Islamist-led forces toppled longtime ruler Bashar Assad in a lightning offensive last month after 13 years of brutal war. Western powers have since been cautiously hoping for greater stability in Syria, a decade after the war triggered a major refugee crisis that shook up European politics. The French and German foreign ministers on Friday visited Syria, although the trip was overshadowed when new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa shook the hand only of France's Jean-Noel Barrot, a man, and not Germany's Annalena Baerbock, a woman.

The Hind Rajab Foundation claims to have filed arrest requests for 1,000 dual-nationality IDF soldiers across eight countries, including a soldier traveling in Brazil whose case made headlines on Sunday; It does not publicly name the soldiers so as not to warn them of their impending arrests; The group's actions highlight the growing global legal threats facing IDF soldiers, prompting swift responses from Israel to protect its citizens from targeted campaigns An IDF soldier was swiftly evacuated from Brazil after the anti-Israel group Hind Rajab Foundation initiated legal proceedings against him. The foundation claimed the soldier was involved in alleged war crimes. This prompted Israel’s Foreign Ministry to act urgently, coordinating with the IDF to identify and extricate the soldier from potential legal risks. The Hind Rajab Foundation, which has targeted IDF soldiers abroad, strategically avoided naming the soldier to prevent Israeli authorities from warning him. Upon learning about the situation, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar and top officials, including the ministry’s director-general, launched a coordinated effort with the IDF to identify the soldier. Within hours, consular officials contacted him and his family, emphasizing the need for immediate evacuation. The soldier, who was traveling in a small group, was flown out of Brazil early the following morning. Israeli consular staff in Brazil assisted in securing a flight, ensuring his safety. Officials determined there was no active arrest warrant against him, but the foundation’s efforts heightened concerns over his legal exposure. While no formal charges or exit restrictions were in place, the ministry conducted a 'quiet review' to ensure the soldier could safely leave the country. A local attorney had filed a request to open an investigation, but no arrest warrant or detainment order was issued. The Foreign Ministry moved preemptively, opting not to take any risks. The soldier and some of his companions have since relocated to a different country. Israeli officials emphasized the importance of avoiding unnecessary risks in such situations and urged IDF personnel to exercise caution when posting on social media, as public statements can lead to legal complications abroad. Behind the Hind Rajab Foundation The Hind Rajab Foundation, named after a six-year-old Palestinian girl allegedly killed in Gaza in January 2023, was established in February by Palestinian activists in Brussels. The organization, affiliated with the broader 'March 30' movement, claims its mission is to seek justice for alleged war crimes committed by Israel against Palestinians. The group has shifted its tactics, avoiding publicizing the names of targeted soldiers to increase their chances of successful legal action. Recent reports from the organization claim it has compiled information on over 1,000 dual-nationality Israeli soldiers involved in the Gaza war. Arrest requests have reportedly been filed in eight countries, including Spain, Ireland and South Africa. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The foundation’s leaders include Diab Abu Jahjah and Karim Hassoun, both based in Belgium. Abu Jahjah, a long-time supporter of Hezbollah, once described the September 11 attacks as 'sweet revenge' in a 2003 New York Times interview. He also founded the Arab League in Europe and continues to post inflammatory statements against Israel on social media. Hassoun, chairman of the Arab European League since 2005, has consistently refused to recognize Israel, describing it as a 'colonialist and racist state.' Following the October 7 Hamas terror attack, Hassoun wrote: 'The Palestinians are not invading Israel; they are returning home and reclaiming their property.' The Hind Rajab Foundation’s latest actions underscore a growing challenge for Israel, as legal threats against IDF personnel escalate worldwide. By acting swiftly, the Foreign Ministry demonstrated its commitment to protecting Israeli citizens from targeted legal and political campaigns. However, the case serves as a stark reminder of the risks Israeli soldiers face abroad. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkz6vpd8yl	2025-01-05T13:04:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/05/SyUVIsv8Jg/SyUVIsv8Jg_0_0_2048_1152_0_small.jpg
Italy in talks over $1.5 billion SpaceX security services deal	Italy is in advanced talks with Elon Musk's SpaceX over a 1.5 billion euro ($1.55 billion) deal for the company to provide secure telecommunications to the government, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday.

The report said the deal involves SpaceX supplying Italy with a full range of encryption for telephone and Internet services used by the government. It also includes communications services for Italy's military in the Mediterranean area and the rollout of satellite services in Italy for use in emergencies such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters, it said.

Syrian women journalists are in the field, documenting the truth	Facing arrests, bombings and loss, Syrian women have become vital voices for truth, paving the way for change and demanding a role in Syria’s future [Idlib] Since the beginning of popular protests against the deposed Syrian regime in 2011 and the development of the conflict into armed strife, women in Syria have played a significant role in conveying the realities of events to Arab and even global communities. Syrian female journalists were present in the field under highly complex security conditions in a society unaccustomed to seeing Syrian women as field reporters. They became guardians of truth, away from bias or misinformation. Activist journalist Sanaa Al-Ali said she can barely recall how it started, due to the overwhelming events she has covered over the years of conflict, which she says culminated in the fall of the regime and President-dictator Bashar Assad’s escape from Syria to Russia. 'I found myself as an activist journalist tasked with conveying the image, voice and pain,' Al-Ali stated, recounting her displacement journey in 2012, which continued until the fall of Assad. Al-Ali recalls how she was displaced from her home in Aleppo city in early 2012, fearing the security grip and arrest, moving to live in rural Idlib. 'There, in Idlib, I had neither a house, furniture, nor a source of livelihood with my three children. It was necessary to take a clear stand as the regime declared its war on us in every way – from intimidation to detention, to sporadic bombings and deploying its army across towns and cities,' she says. Amid the targeting of civilians by Russian and Syrian regime aircraft, Al-Ali decided to become an activist, using her Facebook account to report on massacres. As she describes, this was the beginning of making her a journalist who would convey the people's voice. With the escalation of events in Syria and the growing need to support and empower journalists, journalism training courses spread rapidly in Syria. Syrian female journalists were notably among those who attended. Alongside her news reporting, Al-Ali began taking a course in first aid. Working in the medical field exposes practitioners to numerous injuries, so she started reporting some incidents through the media. She wrote about a child killed by a Syrian regime airstrike in Idlib. This story earned her first place in a journalism competition. Today, despite their difficulties, Al-Ali reflects on the years that have passed. 'My ambitions never stopped. Curiosity led me to train in photography and report preparation, and I was selected among many to become a correspondent for the Syrian agency SY+ from 2019 until now,' she explains. Given the sacrifices they have made in media and other fields, Al-Ali hopes that female journalists in Syria will secure an important role in the country's future. Working as a journalist in Syria was not easy for women, especially amid the complexities of the Syrian situation. After Aleppo fell to the Syrian regime in 2016 and hundreds of thousands were displaced to Idlib, that phase remains unforgettable for Syrians and the world, given the harsh displacement scenes broadcast by media outlets. Under challenging circumstances, Salwa Abdul Rahman faced a significant responsibility to be both a mother and father to her three children after her husband’s death. 'At the beginning of the revolution, my media participation was limited due to the dangerous security situation in Aleppo. However, after being displaced from Aleppo, I started working more extensively,' she said. 'I used to see checkpoints and restrictions. The regime treated us poorly; there were tanks in the cities. My role was limited to reporting facts and documenting events in Aleppo,' Rahman said, recalling her life before Aleppo fell and her husband died in early 2015. This left her solely responsible for three children amid war and displacement. She expanded her journalism work, writing and transmitting reports and news stories to the world. Rahman worked as a correspondent for a television channel, continuing to write and striving to enhance her skills in producing media reports. She studied journalism ethics and emphasized that 'working on the ground provides broader and greater experiences.' Regarding the difficulties she faced, she said: 'Women’s work in field journalism in Syria is inherently challenging due to the complexities of the Syrian scene, including bombing, arrest, kidnapping and numerous restrictions. However, I, like many Syrian women, challenged these circumstances and persisted in writing and working until this regime fell.' However, the current phase is even more challenging, according to Rahman, who believes that access to information has become more difficult during this period due to some journalists monopolizing news due to their proximity to the current government. This undermines journalism and warns of an unfortunate monopoly on information. Similarly, Rana Totenji (not her real name) was displaced from Aleppo after years of journalistic work documenting events through sound and image. She began a new journey in Idlib and Afrin. 'My beginnings were in 2013 when I covered news in newspapers. In 2015-2016, after being displaced from Aleppo, I became a field reporter for the Syrian channel Al-Jisr, which I have continued to do until now. I have also worked with Radio and TV Al-Kul and the Hibr newspaper,' she said. Totenji did not limit herself to journalism. She published two literary novels about Syria, discussing the revolution, camps, displacement, shelling and Damascus. She also runs a media institution that produces journalistic reports and organizes training courses in photography and television presentation. The path has not been paved with roses for Syrian female journalists. They faced arrest, persecution and death at the hands of the ousted Syrian regime and other warring parties in Syria. The Syrian Center for Press Freedoms at the Syrian Journalists Association documented 47 violations against female journalists (both Syrian and foreign) in Syria from 2011 to the end of 2024. Mohammed Al-Sattouf, director of the Documentation and Monitoring Unit at the Press Freedoms Center, stated that seven female journalists, including two foreign journalists, were killed in Syria, and 10 were injured, among them two foreign journalists. Al-Sattouf said that 'the majority of violations against female journalists were of the nature of arrest, detention and kidnapping.' The center documented 18 such cases over various years, with the highest number occurring in 2016 when four arrests were made. Four of these cases involved the arrest and detention of foreign female journalists in Syria. All 18 cases ended with the journalists’ release, except for journalist Samar Al-Saleh, whose fate remains unknown. Other violations included bans on work, security persecutions, threats and more. According to the Syrian Center for Press Freedoms reports, the ousted Syrian regime was responsible for 13 of the documented violations against female journalists. The Democratic Union Party (PYD) and its affiliated security and military apparatus were responsible for 13 as well. The Syrian opposition (now in power) committed six violations, while the perpetrators of five violations remain unknown (unknown individuals or entities). Additionally, Turkish authorities were responsible for three violations, as was ISIS, while Hayat Tahrir al-Sham committed two violations against female journalists. Reviewing Syrian female journalists' activities from 2011 until the fall of the Syrian regime, it is evident that they began to work strongly alongside Syrian youth and activists in media, politics and relief efforts. However, the emergence of ISIS in 2013, coupled with its execution of journalists, led to a noticeable decline in journalistic activity (according to the Syrian Journalists Association). This trend reversed in 2017 and peaked with the fall of the regime. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Syrian Journalists Association, established in exile in 2012, said in a statement that: 'Since the start of the Syrian revolution, female journalists have faced multiple risks, including death, arrest, fleeing from place to place to avoid detention and abuse. The most challenging aspect of their work was documenting violations against civilians, moving between neighborhoods through security and military checkpoints, and navigating streets occupied by snipers. Journalistic work within regime-held areas was fraught with difficulty until some areas in Daraa were liberated, after which the danger of airstrikes intensified. Many female journalists worked under pseudonyms to protect their families in regime-controlled areas.' Today, many Syrian female journalists demand a prominent role in shaping Syria's future. After years of work resembling professional journalism, they highlight women's sacrifices at the expense of their homes and families. As Rana and her colleagues expressed, they believe the homeland belongs to everyone and that everyone must contribute to rebuilding it. -This article is written by Rizik Alabi and reprinted with permission from The Media Line >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hk11gqpd81l	2025-01-05T12:08:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/05/HkosmduLJe/HkosmduLJe_531_332_708_399_0_small.jpg
Hamas says sent list with names of 34 hostages, Israel denies cla...	Terror group official says hostage deal is conditioned on complete halt in fighting and Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip A Hamas official on Sunday commented on the ongoing negotiations for a hostage deal with Israel, telling Reuters that the terrorist organization 'approved a list of 34 hostages presented by Israel to be exchanged in a possible cease-fire deal.' According to the official, Hamas has stipulated that any agreement depends on a cease-fire and a withdrawal from Gaza, and a permanent halt to fighting, though the terror group sees no progress on these issues from Israel at this stage. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that no list has been received by Israel yet, though the Hamas official clarified that the list was merely 'approved.' According to reports, Israel insists on the release of at least 24 live hostages and has therefore requested that Hamas also release injured male hostages under 50 years old on humanitarian grounds. Reports also suggest not all individuals listed as hostages are necessarily alive. Meanwhile, Mossad chief David Barnea may travel to Doha, Qatar, on Monday for the ongoing talks. Most of the terms have reportedly been agreed upon, except for the number of hostages to be released in the deal's initial phase. Not all individuals listed as hostages are necessarily alive Hamas now claims to have finalized a list of those hostages. The sensitive and significant matter remains under heavy secrecy by both Israel and Hamas, leaving the agreement's viability uncertain. Barnea's trip to Doha isn’t confirmed at this time, as he has only traveled to Qatar previously during high-level summits which included CIA Director William Burns and Egyptian intelligence head Hassan Mahmoud Rashad. It's unclear if such a summit is currently planned. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden’s Middle East envoy Brett McGurk is in Doha, signaling heavy American pressure to finalize a deal. However, Washington remains skeptical, despite Biden directing his team to do everything possible to secure an agreement, given his desire to conclude his term with a deal — even a limited one. Israeli officials expressed cautious optimism on the talks, suggesting a deal could be reached this week but stressed the importance of not raising the hostages’ families' hopes prematurely. Sources close to a senior Hamas leader expressed surprise that the terror group’s leadership has adhered to mediator requests and refrained from leaking details about the negotiations to the media. However, these sources told Ynet that 'the direction of the talks remains unclear and we’re still at a critical juncture. The coming days will reveal more.' They added that senior Hamas officials remain cautiously optimistic. Sources told Egyptian TV channel Al-Rad on Sunday that 'disputes remain over the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released, though partial Israeli redeployment to northern Gaza has been agreed upon.' They also reported an understanding regarding partial Israeli presence along the eastern Philadelphi Corridor near the Kerem Shalom border crossing. A meeting between mediators and the Israeli delegation in Doha reportedly lasted only an hour. Separately, an Egyptian source denied Israeli media reports claiming Egypt was preparing for military intervention in Yemen, calling it 'baseless misinformation.' Palestinian officials told the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that there’s 'no discussion of a partial deal or the exile of Hamas leaders from Gaza. Talks are focused on a comprehensive agreement.' They added that the Israeli delegation must 'resolve matters with their political leadership,' noting that Netanyahu held a security meeting on Sunday, though his office denied that the discussion focused on the hostage issue. Earlier, Saudi newspaper Al-Hadath reported positive momentum toward an agreement between Israel and Hamas. The deal would reportedly unfold in phases over two to three months, with Arab and Western countries managing Gaza alongside Palestinian groups. According to the sources, the Palestinian Authority would govern Gaza in coordination with Arab and foreign countries, ensuring immunity for Hamas leaders while Israel refrains from targeting them. The agreement would include Hamas leaders' deportation from Gaza, with governance handed to an independent Palestinian body and possibly international Scandinavian forces stationed in Gaza. The U.S. would sponsor the deal between Hamas and Israel. A Palestinian source familiar with the negotiations told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that 'today is a decisive day for the fate of the negotiations between Hamas and Israel. The mediators managed to bridge gaps with compromise solutions and are awaiting the Israeli government’s response.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The main issue in the negotiations remains how many live hostages will be released. Israel reportedly aimed to secure the release of at least 24 hostages in the first phase of the deal, insisting that Hamas include injured male hostages under 50 as part of a humanitarian exchange phase. Hamas, however, opposes this demand, claiming it wasn’t part of the initial agreements and is requesting either the release of more high-profile terrorists or a greater number of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for younger hostages. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syeacluikg	2025-01-05T11:46:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/23/SJWMZsVDT/SJWMZsVDT_0_31_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
My rabbis support me': 50 Haredi men enlist to new IDF unit	Military opens new Hahashmonaim Brigade designed to be suited to ultra-Orthodox lifestyle and religious standards; Some were accompanied by family members, while others arrived alone. About 50 young ultra-Orthodox men arrived at IDF recruitment offices across the country on Sunday and enlisted in the new Hahashmonaim Brigade. The IDF marked the first recruitment day for the infantry brigade, designed specifically to accommodate the ultra-Orthodox community's religious standards. Some of the recruits, who are slated for combat roles, were accompanied by family members, while others arrived alone. According to the IDF, some 100 ultra-Orthodox men were set to complete their induction by the end of the day and begun a six-month infantry training program. Upon completion, they will form the brigade's first reserve company. Additional recruitment drives will be held later this month and new recruits will join the basic training phase. 'I always thought about enlisting, but until two months ago, I was planning to get an exemption,' Yaakov, 22, shared. 'When I was offered the Hahashmonaim, I was thrilled.' Uriel Cohen from Bnei Brak, who had been studying at a yeshiva in Afula, was one of the recruits who joined despite family opposition. 'Two or three years ago, I was in yeshiva,' he said. 'Enlisting wasn’t even something on my mind. But about six months ago, I decided, ‘Alright, I’m doing this.’' Addressing rabbinic opposition to enlistment, he added: 'Not all rabbis oppose it. My rabbis support me.' Eliyahu Brodner from Beit Shemesh explained his motivation to join. 'After October 7, I wanted to enlist. I saw young men my age falling in the war. I didn’t feel comfortable sitting in yeshiva. I’m not exactly studying all day. I didn’t feel right about it — they’re sacrificing their lives to protect me. 'But even then, I didn’t have an option until this unit was established. It’s a new place and my rabbis told me privately, ‘Go there.’ If an individual is fully committed to his yeshiva studies, he should stay there. But for someone like me, who isn’t, he should enlist.' Another recruit, a 26-year-old father of three selected for a staff role rather than combat, explained his decision to join after realizing he couldn’t continue yeshiva studies in the coming years. The young man, who studies in a kollel and teaches at a Talmud Torah, said: 'I teach my students to do what’s needed for the people of Israel – either study Torah or contribute to the nation. Right now, what’s needed is to enlist and it’s important to set an example. I decided to start working after 10 years in a yeshiva but to do that, I need to follow the path everyone else takes.' Yossi Hertz, a 32-year-old ultra-Orthodox man from the U.S. and one of the oldest recruits in the unit, had decided to enlist five years ago but was initially turned away due to his age. 'There’s an obligation to serve and I want to do my part and fulfill my responsibility. I tell every ultra-Orthodox man: if you’re sitting in the study hall all day — that’s fine. But if you’re not learning, do something with your life,' he said.

Hezbollah leader Nasrallah killed last year inside war operations...	Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike last year while inside the terror group's war operations room, according to new details Sunday disclosed by a senior Hezbollah official. A series of Israeli airstrikes flattened several buildings in Beirut's southern suburbs on Sept. 27, 2024, killing Nasrallah. The Lebanese Health Ministry said six people died. According to news reports, Nasrallah and other senior officials were meeting underground. The assassination of Nasrallah, who had led Hezbollah for 32 years, turned months of low-level strikes between Israel and Hezbollah into all-out war that battered much of southern and eastern Lebanon for two months until a U.S.-brokered cease-fire took effect Nov. 27. 'His Eminence (Hassan Nasrallah) used to lead the battle and war from this location,' top Hezbollah security official Wafiq Safa told a news conference Sunday near near the site where Nasrallah was killed. He said Nasrallah died in the war operations room. He did not offer other details. Lebanese media had reported that Safa was a target of Israeli airstrikes in central Beirut before the cease-fire but appeared unscathed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk4od8o8je	2025-01-05T10:12:34-08:00	
FBI looking into New Orleans attack suspect's visits to Egypt, Ca...	The FBI is looking into past visits to Egypt and Canada by the suspect in the New Year's Day attack in New Orleans that killed 14 people after a truck was rammed into a crowd of revelers, an FBI official told reporters on Sunday. Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a U.S. Army veteran, 42, who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State extremist group, was the suspect in the attack and the FBI says he acted alone. He was killed in a shootout with police after the rampage, which also injured dozens of people and has been labeled by the FBI as an act of terrorism. 'We have also tracked that Jabbar traveled to Cairo, Egypt, from June 22 until July 3 of 2023. A few days later he flew to Ontario, Canada, on July 10 and returned to the U.S. on July 13 of 2023,' Lyonel Myrthil, FBI special agent in charge of the New Orleans field office, said at a press briefing. 'Our agents are getting answers as to where he went, who he met with and how those trips may or may not tie into his actions in our city in New Orleans,' he added. The FBI also said Jabbar made at least two trips to New Orleans in the months prior to the attack, one in October and the other in November.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1c6i8o8jx	2025-01-05T10:06:06-08:00

Some 40% of Hamas tunnels’ still remain in Gaza, expert says	Israel intensifies its war on Hamas in Gaza, targeting terrorist while negotiating a cease-fire and hostage release deal; With heavy losses on both sides, the conflict remains unresolved, and Gaza's future remains uncertain Israel continued to pound Gaza over the weekend, as Palestinians reported tens of people killed in the ongoing war between the Hamas terrorist organization and the Jewish state. The Israel Defense Forces announced it had carried out airstrikes against over 100 targets, including Hamas terrorists and rocket launching sites. For over a year, Israel has staged a massive military operation against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Its stated goals are to remove Hamas as a governing power in the territory and release all the hostages. In what appears to be an intensification of the fighting and amid the war, Hamas and Israel are engaged in indirect talks aimed at reaching a cease-fire and releasing at least some of the 100 Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas since the beginning of the war. Thousands of Israelis rallied on Saturday evening to protest the government and pressure it to reach a deal with Hamas. Several weeks ago, there was initial optimism that a deal was imminent. Now, the talks mediated by the US, Egypt, and Qatar seem to be at yet another impasse. Israel’s continued military presence in the Gaza Strip and the refusal by the current government to withdraw from the territory, a pre-condition by Hamas for any deal, has so far blocked a cease-fire from being reached. The army is not only present in Gaza, but it also continues to fight at varying levels of intensity. On Friday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued evacuation warnings for areas in the center of the Gaza Strip ahead of an operation there. The IDF also continued to operate in the north of the territory. 'The area consists of structures overlooking Israeli territory and serves as a central terror hub containing anti-tank firing positions, booby traps, shafts, numerous explosives, and launch sites for targeting Israeli territory,' the IDF said in a statement. In addition, the army continues to control the Philadephi and Netzarim corridors in southern and central Gaza, respectively, aimed at blocking Hamas from being able to re-arm and re-position itself. Adopting a policy of incursions rather than operating in the whole of Gaza continuously, the IDF has found itself often re-entering areas it has already operated in several times. This policy of 'mowing the grass,' coined by Professor Efraim Inbar and Dr. Eitan Shamir, has entangled Israel in its longest war ever. It refers to a strategy of pinpointed military operations limited in time to quell a temporary threat, barring a more permanent political solution. But, according to Shamir, director of the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar Ilan University, Hamas’ military abilities cannot be defeated as quickly as critics of the IDF strategy would like to believe. 'Hamas had over 20 years to accumulate a massive amount of firepower, dispersing it in many areas, including in its widespread underground tunnel network,' Shamir said. 'Combined with other terrorist organizations, such as the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), it had approximately 30,000 fighters. This could take two to three years to get rid of.' Israeli forces are continuing to find weapons depots and to encounter Hamas terrorists and tunnels, in a testament to the continued Hamas presence in the territory. 'There is an estimated 40% of the tunnels still remaining, hundreds of kilometers of tunnels the Israeli intelligence was not aware of,' said Yoni Ben Menachem, an expert of Middle Eastern affairs from Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs. 'There are still very long tunnels that Israel has yet to have located, some of them with hostages inside. This requires a very big operation and a massive amount of explosives that Israel currently does not possess.' Hamas stunned Israel on October 7, 2023, when it attacked the south of the country in a rampage that killed approximately 1,200 Israelis and wounded thousands more. It also took approximately 250 people hostage, 100 still in captivity. In response, Israel launched a massive war against Hamas. According to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, over 45,000 Palestinians have been killed since and over 107,000 wounded. Some 390 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the ground invasion of Gaza. The war quickly developed into a regional, multi-front confrontation. The Lebanese Hezbollah organization and the Houthi rebels in Yemen began launching attacks against Israel, forcing it to respond and divert critical resources to other fronts. A fragile and temporary ceasefire with Hezbollah has been in place for a month now. Should it last, Israeli troops are expected to withdraw from southern Lebanon at the end of January. 'Israel does not have enough forces at this point to subdue Hamas both militarily and in its ability to govern Gaza,' Ben Menachem said. 'In order to do that, Israel needs to occupy the entire Gaza Strip and announce it is enforcing temporary military administration.' According to Ben Menachem, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government is waiting for major developments before progressing in that direction. One is the fate of the cease-fire and hostage deal talks, and the other is the upcoming change in the U.S. administration, with President Joe Biden's departure and Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20. Netanyahu hopes Trump, who has favored his policies during his previous term, will pose less of an impediment. 'The Israeli government has so far avoided discussing its plans for Gaza after the war because of the opposition from the Biden administration to an Israeli military rule there,' Ben Menachem said. Netanyahu has not ruled out military rule in Gaza, although he has shot down calls from within his coalition to re-settle Gaza with Jewish settlements. In addition to setting Hamas’ removal from power as one of the war goals, the Israeli premier has also voiced opposition to the return of the Palestinian Authority to rule Gaza, deeming it a supporter of terrorism. 'The alternative to incursions is military rule, which will enable complete control of Gaza,' said Shamir. 'It will prevent, not completely, Hamas’ ability to rise up. But it will require a lot of resources because it is essentially occupying Gaza.' Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005, ending 38 years of complete control of the territory. 'It will take a long time, but Israel’s presence in Gaza now, including its blockade on Gaza through the control of all of its entrances, is not the perfect option,' Shamir added. 'But it does meet the needs. There is not much different that Israel can do, and it will take time.' The Israeli leader is also facing calls to change the policy regarding the distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza. The aid, facilitated mainly by Israel through its control of all of Gaza’s entry points, has been an issue of contention within Israel since the beginning of the war in October of last year. It has also been subject to international scrutiny and critique. Some members of the government want to see the IDF distributing the aid as a means to weaken Hamas' hold on Gaza. Right now, Israel oversees the entrance of the aid but has humanitarian organizations responsible for its dispersal, a process often hampered by Hamas’ ability to take over the aid and control its distribution. Israeli media has reported that the IDF Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, plans to resign in the coming weeks. Halevi, who is seen by many in the Israeli public as partially responsible for the blunder that enabled Hamas’ surprise attack, is reportedly awaiting the conclusion of internal military inquiries into events that led up to the war. Halevi is believed to have been contrarian to the Netanyahu government on many issues, including humanitarian aid and the conduct of the war effort in Gaza. 'There are places in Gaza, especially in the center, which the army has not entered yet,' said Ben Menachem. 'The war in Gaza has been handled haphazardly, with a lack of strategy. Mowing the grass is not efficient and can only be done once Hamas has been won over in order to prevent it from re-grouping and not when it still has a standing army of 20,000 armed terrorists.' The presence of Israeli hostages is also believed to be one of the reasons behind decision-making in the war. 'The presence of hostages does not pose a major limitation on how the war is waged,' said Shamir. 'The IDF effort is limited by international law and the deep embedment of Hamas terrorists in the civilian population in Gaza.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: If the cease-fire talks fail, there could be an intensification of the fighting by Israel in an attempt to increase the pressure on Hamas. However, after 15 months of war, the terrorist organization has shown no flexibility in its demand from Israel to completely withdraw from Gaza and stop all military action against it. This is despite the massive price Palestinians have paid and the widespread damage in the Gaza Strip, which has rendered many areas unrecognizable. 'The hostages remain Hamas’ only leverage,' said Shamir. 'Unless Israel meets Hamas demands, only a partial deal that will ease some of the pressure off Hamas is possible.' -This article is written by Keren Setton and reprinted with permission from The Media Line >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bkf2zs008jx	2025-01-05T09:23:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/05/HyM7prEuLJe/HyM7prEuLJe_1_67_1601_901_0_small.jpg

I couldn't stop crying': Ex-hostage Dafna Elyakim recalls captiv...	After being released alongside her sister in the first hostage deal, Dafna Elyakim says seeing sign of life from IDF lookout over the weekend was a relief for her and stresses need to return all hostages home Dafna Elyakim, 16, who was released from Hamas captivity in the first hostage deal in November 2023 along with her sister Ela, recounted the days she spent in captivity with abducted IDF lookout Liri Albag at an event held on Sunday. Hamas released a video on Saturday showing a sign of life from Albag, who was abducted on October 7, 2023. 'Liri would smile, laugh and try to find the positive,' Dafna shared. 'She said that if we survived what happened on October 7, there's no way they'd kill us after a month. We'd sing songs, talk about restaurants and family — anything to pass the time while we were there.' 'When I saw proof of life and her name while I was on the bus, I couldn't stop crying. It was a relief — she's alive, she's okay — but at the same time, I thought about what she must be going through and what they were doing to her there,' she shared. 'I want to tell her that she's strong, to keep being strong and that she'll come home soon. We'll get her out of there soon and everything will be okay in the end,' Dafna said. She also recalled how she endured captivity herself: 'What helped me was having my younger sister with me. It meant there was someone else from my family with me. Even now, I don't feel like I've fully returned. It feels like a dream like I'm still there with the other hostages I was with.' Dafna explained why she chose to speak at the event. 'It was important for me to come and share the story so people would know what happened on October 7 and so it won't be forgotten. We mustn't forget the hostages. We need to keep mentioning them, talking about them and – for those who can – to join protests and shout what the hostages can't. 'It's really moving to see large crowds at protests, where you can't even move when people come to show they care about the hostages. It's uplifting to see that someone still cares. We can also keep praying, hoping and doing everything to bring them all back.' On May 19, the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit released a video filmed by Hamas terrorists showing Ela Elyakim, Dafna's eight-year-old sister, speaking to the camera from captivity.

A guide for IDF soldiers: Here's how to act if arrested abroad an...	Following the escape of an IDF soldier from Brazil and the arrest request for another soldier in Chile, concerns are growing about the legal threats IDF personnel face while traveling overseas; Are officers at greater risk? What should soldiers check before their flight? And how should they respond to questions after landing? Here’s what you need to know The escape from Brazil of an IDF soldier facing a court-ordered investigation and the immediate arrest request for another soldier traveling in Chile are just two examples of cases involving IDF personnel since the start of the war. Arrest warrants for Israeli soldiers have also been issued in European countries. So, what should a soldier do if arrested abroad? Are officers at greater risk? Which countries should soldiers avoid visiting? Here’s what you need to know. What should a soldier do if arrested abroad? Attorney Nick Kaufman, a defense lawyer at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, advises: 'According to Israel's Foreign Ministry guidelines, any detained Israeli – whether a civilian or a soldier – is entitled to consular assistance. A soldier arrested abroad must immediately request a visit from the Israeli consul.' Are officers at greater risk than soldiers? 'Absolutely,' Kaufman says. 'Officers are more closely linked to decision-making and policies, such as target selection and managing military operations.' Does sharing footage online increase legal risk? 'Definitely. Soldiers who post videos online provide hostile organizations with potential evidence to support suspicions against them,' according to Kaufman. Is it dangerous for a soldier who served in Gaza to travel abroad? 'The risk stems from the principle of 'universal jurisdiction,' which allows certain countries to arrest, investigate and prosecute individuals suspected of serious crimes, including war crimes and crimes against humanity.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Could I be arrested abroad for actions in Gaza? 'Evidence linking an individual soldier to illegal acts would be required. Simply serving in Gaza is not enough.' How can I check if my destination poses a risk before traveling? 'Human rights organizations publish reports online detailing the application of universal jurisdiction in various countries. Consulting an international criminal law expert is strongly recommended.' What precautions should be taken before traveling? 'Soldiers should avoid posting photos or videos from their service, especially content showing destroyed buildings, even if there’s a military justification. Such posts violate operational security and could harm Israel’s image. Some countries might treat seemingly minor content, such as racist songs, as incitement to genocide.' Which countries should soldiers avoid? 'The list of countries applying universal jurisdiction changes over time. Even friendly nations like the UK, France and Spain have applied it in the past. Procedures vary – some countries require a court’s approval for arrests, while others may act based on a simple police complaint.' What should I do if questioned by authorities abroad? 'Carefully consider traveling to countries where officials may raise such questions. Lying at border control is not an option and could lead to denied entry.' Should Israel fund legal defense for soldiers arrested abroad? 'If a soldier is wrongly detained for lawful service, the state should cover their defense costs. However, this becomes problematic when there’s credible suspicion of war crimes. Funding one soldier’s defense could set a precedent requiring similar support for others accused of serious crimes.' Does Israel maintain a 'blacklist' of soldiers at risk of arrest? 'The IDF’s International Law Department provides commanders with legal advice, including on battlefield conduct to prevent future legal issues. To the best of my knowledge, there’s no 'blacklist' of soldiers at risk of arrest.' What about international legal battles against Israel?

The IDF also conducts internal investigations when necessary and emphasizes legal training for active-duty and reserve soldiers.' Will traveling become safer after the fighting ends? 'The threat may not diminish and could even intensify as Gaza opens to human rights groups and foreign journalists.' Can insurance cover arrests abroad? 'I’m not aware of any insurance company that provides coverage for arrests abroad related to alleged criminal acts.

UNRWA denies reports it will stop operating in Gaza and West Bank	After NYT report that the UN agency for Palestinian refugees plans to end its activities in Gaza and the West Bank, the agency's communications director Juliette Thom says it is 'committed to continuing to provide essential services, calls report of agency's shuttering programs 'grossly inaccurate' UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, strongly denied today Sunday a report that it is preparing to end its activities in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, in light of Knesset legislation passed that bans the organization's activities on Israeli soil. The denial comes after the report in the New York Times on Friday, which claimed that the agency 'is preparing to close its activities due to new Israeli restrictions.' The report quoted Louise Wateridge, a senior UNRWA official, as saying that the law would undermine the necessary coordination with Israel to deliver aid to the territories. According to her, 'the lives of our staff will be at risk' if information is not shared with Israeli authorities. Closing the operation 'would be a massive impact on an already catastrophic situation,',' added Jamie McGoldrick, who was in charge of UN aid operations in Gaza and the West Bank until April. ' 'If that is what the Israeli intention is — to remove any ability for us to save lives — you have to question what is the thinking and what is the end goal?' UNRWA supporters claim that the cessation of operations would be a fatal blow to the Palestinian population. 'The world has abandoned us. We have nothing but the aid we get from UNRWA to survive,' Sami Abu Darweesh, 30, who lives in a refugee camp in southern Gaza run by UNRWA, told the newspaper. 'If that stops, what will we do?' Juliette Thom, UNRWA's communications director, rejected the report, describing it as 'grossly inaccurate.' Thom noted that the agency's director-general, Philippe Lazarini, had previously stressed the agency's commitment to continuing to provide essential services. She said, 'If someone has an opinion, that doesn't mean it's right.'

Pressure on UNRWA increased after many Western countries, including the US, Switzerland and Britain, froze or halted funding to the agency, citing 'fear of funds being used for terrorist purposes,' a move that further exacerbated the difficulties for the agency. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byerrz00uje	2025-01-05T06:38:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/29/By1DGQ0g1e/By1DGQ0g1e_0_289_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Palestinians release footage showing Israeli forces disembarking from a vehicle disguised as an ambulance during a raid on a Nablus refugee camp The Palestinians on Sunday released unusual footage showing armed fighters in the Balata refugee camp in Nablus disembarking from a vehicle disguised as an ambulance. According to Palestinian reports, the video was filmed approximately two and a half weeks ago during an IDF raid on the camp. On the day of the operation, Palestinians reported the deaths of two individuals, including an 80-year-old woman. The IDF also reportedly employed a 'pressure cooker' tactic against the terrorists.

Ten years since the Charlie Hebdo massacre: Cartoons, the far-lef...	A decade has passed since four million French people took to the streets and shouted 'Je suis Charlie' after the horrific attack on the magazine by Islamists after it published a cartoon of Mohammed France will on Tuesday mark the tenth anniversary of the attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo on January 7, 2015, which claimed the lives of 12 people, including the editor at the time, Stéphane Charbonnier, and wounded 11. That morning, Said and Cherif Kouachi burst into the office armed with guns and murdered those present, shouting as they left, 'We killed Charlie Hebdo. ' However, they did not kill the satirical periodical, which has been around for 55 years. As the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Gerard Bier, who survived the attack because he was in London that day, said this week, 'They didn't succeed, we want it to live for another thousand years.' On Sunday, as part of the tenth anniversary events, which led to the murder of a policewoman on the outskirts of Paris and the attack on the Kosher supermarket in the 20th arrondissement of Paris, the newspaper kicked off a competition for the most daring cartoons against God. The #Laughing at God competition received 350 cartoons from all over the world, of which 39 of the most successful illustrations were published. The cartoons, it should be noted, mock all religions. Among other things, the special issue includes an article dedicated to threats to secularism in Israel. And yet, times have changed since four million took to the streets after the massacre to shout 'JeSuisCharlie.' The Charlie Hebdo editorial office is now located in an undisclosed location, and its main writers still live under 24-hour guard. Just last weekend, the memorial plaque for the policeman murdered in the Charlie Hebdo attack was vandalized, with the graffiti 'Je suis Gaza' sprayed on it. The current editor, Laurent Sourisseau, known as Riss, accused the left of turning a blind eye to Islamic violence in a book published last month in memory of the victims of the attack: 'Politicians, journalists and intellectuals from the left continue to turn a blind eye to the threat of radical Islam in order to gain the support of Muslim communities, and in this way also fuel anti-Semitism.' Bernard Cazeneuve, the interior minister at the time of the attack, told the weekly Le Nouvel Obs magazine this week that 'part of the radical left cynically thinks that Muslims are 'potential clients' for election campaigns.' The special issue published this week features a survey showing that 76% of French people support freedom of expression through cartoons. Culture Minister Rachida Dati also announced this week the opening of the Museum of Journalistic Illustration in 2027, a project that has been in the works for many years. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Dozens of attempted attacks were foiled in France in 2024, three of which were during the Olympic Games, and the global wave of antisemitism and the recent terrorist attacks in the U.S. do not bode well. 'Our consolation all these years has been the support we have received. 'Lucky you're there,' they tell us,' Riss wrote in the editorial for the special issue: 'And we answer: 'Lucky you're there.' In these ten years, Charlie Hebdo has become more than a newspaper. Our struggle is for us to be free.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skl4ck008jg	2025-01-05T03:25:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2015/01/07/5802306/5802306_235_122_478_270_0_small.jpg

U.S. Special Mid-East envoy Brett McGurk also in Doha; Netanyahu summons ministerial consultation although claims it is not about hostages Mossad chief David Barnea is expected to travel to Doha on Monday for talks on a possible hostage release deal. American special envoy to the Middle East Brett McGurk is already in the Qatari capital, indicating the importance that the Biden administration attaches to the meetings and the efforts to reach a deal before Donald Trump takes office on January 20th. 'This is a critical day for the negotiations between Israel and Hamas,' a Palestinian source told the Qatari Al Araby Al Jadeed newspaper on Sunday adding that the mediators were able to bridge the gap between the sides and await the response of the Israeli government later on Sunday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu scheduled a security consultation for the afternoon on Sunday, a day after the Hamas released a video of IDF solder Liri Elbag who has been held hostage for 457 days, since the October 7 massacre. Netanyahu invited the members of the small forum of the cabinet for the meeting that was announced by the Prime Minister's Office earlier with a claim that it was not in regard to the hostages. The issues that were outstanding and prevented an agreement from being reached remain the number of hostages that would be released. The Israeli aim, according to published reports, was to have at least 24 hostages freed in the first phase of the deal including wounded men under the age of 50. Hamas insists that demand was not included in the 'agreements' thus far and demand a larger number of convicted murderers to be included in the Palestinian prisoners that Israel would release from prison, in exchange. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another obstacle was the Israeli demand to receive a list of all live hostages, which Hamas says it would not be able to supply unless there is a week of lull in the fighting.

Chilean lawyers demand the arrest of Israeli soldier hiding in Pa...	Members of the AbogadosxPalestina lawyer group call for 'the immediate arrest' of Israeli ex-soldier Saar Hirshoren, who is accused of committing war crimes in Gaza A pro-Palestinian group called AbogadosxPalestina, consisting of 620 Chilean lawyers demanded the arrest of a discharged Israeli IDF soldier Saar Hirshoren who is currently traveling in Chile for his involvement in 'crimes against humanity' and 'genocide' in the Gaza war. Earlier, a federal court in Brazil ordered an investigation into a visiting Israeli, who served in the IDF, for possible war crimes after the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) provided the court with documentation of the soldier's activity in the war in Gaza. The suspect was a survivor of the Nova music festival massacre on Oct. 7. According to reports he was able to leave Brazil before any legal action was taken against him. 'We have filed this complaint so that an investigation is carried out and as a preventive measure, the immediate arrest of this Israeli soldier is carried out so that he can be held accountable for the crimes committed and take responsibility before international criminal justice,' said lawyer and former Chilean ambassador Nelson Hadad at a press conference on Friday, who explained that the arrest must take place 'before the imminent escape attempt.' Hadad added that the 'issue is extremely urgent. We have to assume our responsibility and we cannot accept that after having massacred hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, mostly children and women, they can be allowed to come to Chilean Patagonia for vacation.' The former Chilean ambassador is one of the 620 lawyers who last year denounced the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The lawyers accuse Hirshoren of 'deliberately demolishing neighborhoods, cultural sites and essential facilities in Gaza with inhuman, cruel, degrading and abominable acts, causing ethnic cleansing and forced displacement of people,' said the senator of the conservative party Renovación Nacional, Francisco Chahuán, who leads the lawyers who filed the complaint along with Hadad. The complaint was supported by the testimony of a Palestinian woman living in Chile whose family was a allegedly a victim of the operations of the Israeli Army commando to which Hirshoren is said to belong, seeks, in the words of Hadad, 'to make international criminal justice prevail, regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator.' 'The principle of extraterritoriality based on Law 20357 (which classifies crimes against humanity and genocide and war crimes and offences), together with our ratification of the Rome Statute gives jurisdiction to Chilean courts to prosecute this type of crimes,' said Chahuán. According to the member of AbogadosxPalestina, Paula Abugattas, 'the importance of this complaint is that it can kick start additional legislation in other countries where there are soldiers who have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity.' The complaint filed with the Metropolitan Prosecutor's Office is added to the one filed by the Belgium-based Hind Rajab Foundation, which on December 26 requested the arrest of Saar Hirshoren after being located in Argentina and, later, in Chile. The exact whereabouts of the soldier are currently unknown. The lawyers have announced that, in addition to having filed this complaint with the Chilean Prosecutor's Office, they are going to file a 'criminal action' before the International Criminal Court for the same crimes. 'We advocate for a state solution where Israel and Palestine can live side by side with full respect for international law and international humanitarian law, with secure and internationally recognized borders,' said Chahuán regarding the position regarding this historic conflict of the lawyers and of Chile, a country that hosts the largest community of Palestinians outside the Arab world.

Soldier and his friends visiting Patagonia are able to leave the South American country before legal action is taken; family says is relieved and is awaiting his return; Knesset FA&D committee to discuss legal risk to IDF soldiers The Israeli soldier who was under investigation in Brazil for alleged war crimes in the war in Gaza, left the country with his friends before legal action could be taken against him, his family told Ynet, adding they were relieved after a tense period of time and were awaiting his return home. 'He's out of there,' his father said. 'Everything will be fine.' Chairperson of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Yuli Edelstein (Likud) said he would hold an urgent classified meeting to discuss the 'defense from legal persecution of soldiers abroad,' on Monday. 'For months members of the committee and I have warned, time and again, that the judicial persecution under false accusations of war crime would not stop at the prime minister and defense minister and would spread to include IDF troops,' Edelstein said. 'I am embarrassed for Brazil and its government which succumbed to the pro-Palestine legal terrorism,' he said. 'I expect to hear from representatives of the IDF and the Foreign Ministry, about their plans of action to defend our soldiers from sanctions and such criminal persecution.' Last November, the International Criminal Court in the Hague issued arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then defense minister Yoav Gallant on suspicion of war crimes committed in the fighting in Gaza. The Brazilian federal court ordered an investigation into the Israeli after a claim was made by the Palestinian Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) which provided the court with documentation of the soldier's activity in the war in Gaza. The suspect was a survivor of the Nova music festival massacre on Oct. 7. According to the claim, the soldier, who was on a trip in Patagonia, was documented placing explosives that were used to demolish buildings where displaced Gazan's were sheltering.

'On October 6 we were very much pursuing normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel,' the top diplomat of the Biden administration told the New York Times.

Brazil probes Israeli tourist for alleged war crimes	Brazilian federal court orders an investigation after Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) issues complaint including video, photographs showing IDF soldier during Gaza war A federal court in Brazil ordered an investigation into a visiting Israeli, who served in the IDF, for possible war crimes after the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) provided the court with documentation of the soldier's activity in the war in Gaza. The foundation that was named for a six-year-old Palestinian girl that was claimed to have been killed by IDF fire during the war, said that the Brazilian government decided to take action after a complaint was filed against the Israeli who arrived in Brazil a week ago. In their complaint the foundation said his actions were part of a broader effort that included genocide and crimes against humanity, according to international law. The foundation provided video clips, geographic locations and photos allegedly showing the Israeli placing explosives and participating in the destruction of 'entire neighborhoods' in Gaza that were claimed to have been housing displaced Gazans, last November. 'These materials prove beyond doubt the direct involvement of the suspect in these despicable acts,' HRF said. According to a report in the Metropoles online newspaper, a Brazilian lawyer explained that the investigation in Brazil was initiated because the country is a signatory of the Rome Statue. 'Any country that has signed the statue is compelled to ensure that crimes such as war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide must be investigated and their perpetrators must be brought to justice,' she said. It called on Brazil to immediately detain the suspect before he flees the country and 'destroys evidence,' adding that the families whose homes were destroyed have joined the complaint.

The IDF later clarified that the missile was intercepted before entering Israeli territory and that the alarms were activated due to concerns over falling debris. During that incident, an 18-year-old woman in Yavne sustained minor injuries while running to a shelter, and pieces of the interception fell in Beit Shemesh. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1e8f8vi1l	2025-01-04T15:39:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/03/rkhs7grU1g/rkhs7grU1g_141_91_676_381_0_small.jpg

Tragic irony': Two Israelis injured in New Orleans attack fought...	The two reservists decided to travel to the U.S. together following a year of war and were injured when the terrorist rammed them with his car; one's condition remains critical The two Israelis in their 20s who were seriously and moderately injured in the ramming and shooting attack in New Orleans this week had previously served together in reserve duty during the war, taking part in battles in both Gaza and Lebanon. Recently, they left on a six-week trip to the U.S. to recover from the past year's events. It appears they were injured by the vehicular ramming rather than the gunfire by the terrorist. They’re currently hospitalized in New Orleans and will only be flown back to Israel once their conditions stabilize. The two have known each other since their compulsory military service and had planned to conclude their U.S. trip with a visit to a relative of one of them in Florida. The Foreign Ministry aided their families to fly to Louisiana. One of them remains in critical condition due to head trauma and limb injuries, undergoing two life-saving surgeries so far. He's still in a life-threatening condition. His friend’s condition is more stable, though he sustained severe limb injuries and internal trauma. He's no longer in danger but has undergone two major surgeries as well. On Friday, his breathing tubes were removed and he was able to communicate with his family for the first time, recounting what he remembered of the attack. Israel's Deputy Consul General to the U.S. Elad Shoshan, told the New York Post: ' That’s the tragic irony. They left the terror of one country and never expected to be victims of it in another. They came here to relax, to travel. Now that’s interrupted in the most horrific way.' Shoshan mentioned that he managed to briefly communicate with the critically injured Israeli before his first surgery: 'He pressed my hand. He’s in severe pain all over his body. When people chant, ‘Globalize the intifada,’ it means importing violence from one region to another. 'And that’s exactly what’s happening. They want to bring violence and terror to America. Israel and the U.S. are fighting the same ideology, the same enemy, as on October 7. Hamas acted like ISIS, that was its inspiration—just like this terrorist.' The New Year’s Eve attack in New Orleans, which left 12 people dead and 35 injured, was carried out by Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old Texas resident and former U.S. Army serviceman. The FBI confirmed reports that an ISIS flag was found in his car and is investigating his ties to the terror organization. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The attack took place around 3:15 a.m. local time on Bourbon Street in the heart of the city’s French Quarter, a well-known entertainment district.

U.S. pessimistic on ongoing hostage deal talks in Qatar	Officials stress talks are still ongoing despite sounding skepticism amid widening gaps and release of video showing hostage Liri Albag in captivity U.S. officials briefed on the ongoing negotiations for a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas in Qatar, where the Israeli delegation arrived on Friday, expressed skepticism about progress on Saturday, saying, 'It'll be difficult to reach a deal by January 20,' the date of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. Despite the pessimism and following Hamas’ release of a video showing IDF lookout Liri Albag who’s been held captive in Gaza since October 7, the officials clarified: 'Efforts are still ongoing. According to the Americans, reports from Doha indicate skepticism and significant gaps that hinder progress before the set deadline. Trump issued a warning to Hamas last month notifying the terror group of serious consequences should the hostages not be released. The reported skepticism is unusual, as the Americans have typically projected optimism during the negotiations. However, all involved on the U.S. side appear doubtful at this time. Still, one U.S. official suggested that the skepticism could be a positive sign, noting that negotiations often fail when optimism is high. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden’s envoy to the Middle East Brett McGurk is expected to join the talks in Doha, likely to make a final push to secure a deal before Trump’s inauguration. In response to the U.S. skepticism, senior Israeli officials said, 'There’s still a chance for a deal,' though no guarantees exist. An Israeli source noted, 'Progress has been made but it’ll take more time. The outcome of the negotiations is unpredictable.' Additionally, Israel views Hamas’ release of Liri’s video at this time as an attempt at psychological warfare and public opinion manipulation aimed at extracting further concessions from Israel. The Israeli delegation, composed of Mossad, Shin Bet and IDF Military Intelligence officials, arrived in Doha on Friday morning. However, their mandate to conduct the talks was granted only in the afternoon, following a phone consultation between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his team. Netanyahu 'approved the continuation of the negotiations,' giving the delegation a mandate to advance. Nonetheless, gaps remain, despite Israel describing the process as 'slow progress.' The disparities between the parties center on several issues, the most pressing being the number of hostages to be released in the deal. Hamas is willing to release a very limited number of live hostages and refuses to provide a list of names upfront, which Israel insists on as a basis for progress. Currently, the gap between the number of hostages Hamas is prepared to release and Israel's demands for a humanitarian hostage release phase is substantial. Disagreements also persist over ending the war and the military presence along the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors.

Syria's international airport to reopen in bid to show stability	De facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa announces international flights to the country will resume soon as more countries decide to open routes to Syria Syria's main airport in its capital of Damascus will reopen for international flights for the first time since the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime next week, the country's new government announced on Saturday. The airport’s reopening, which was targeted multiple times by Israel according to foreign reports, is seen as an attempt by Jihadist rebel leader and de facto authority in Syria Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani), to project stability. 'We assure Arab and international airlines that we've begun the reconstruction of the airports in Aleppo and Damascus with the help of our partners so they can receive aircraft from around the world,' state news agency SANA cited Syria's Civil Aviation Authority head as saying. International aid planes have already landed in Syria since the coup and domestic flights within the country have resumed. According to the AFP news agency, the first flight since Assad's escape occurred on December 18, when a plane flew from Damascus Airport to Aleppo. Qatar Airways was quick to announce its return to flying to Syria for the first time in 13 years. Meanwhile, Egypt's Foreign Ministry reported that an Egyptian cargo plane landed at Damascus Airport on Saturday, delivering humanitarian aid from Cairo to Syria for the first time since Assad's ousting. The plane carried 15 tons of supplies and food as part of Egypt's 'commitment to support our brothers, the Syrian people.' The shipment, provided by the Egyptian Red Crescent Society, was handed over to its Syrian partners and included tents, blankets, food and medical supplies. Last week, Saudi Arabia launched a 'humanitarian airlift' effort to Syria, delivering food, tents and medical equipment.

Hezbollah chief: 'Our patience may run out before the cease-fire ...	Terror group's Secretary-General Naim Qassem warns in speech organization is ready to resume hostilities if cease-fire conditions aren't upheld including IDF withdrawal from Lebanon Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem claimed on Saturday that his terror organization successfully repelled Israel's actions in Lebanon during the war. 'For 64 days, Israel tried to advance into our territory but only managed to move hundreds of meters,' Qassem said. 'Israel failed to penetrate deeper into our land thanks to the strength of the resistance. The resistance is powerful, deterrent and effective, disrupting the enemy's objectives despite the extensive destruction and Israeli aggression,' he added. Regarding the fragile cease-fire, Qassem said, 'The resistance wielded significant power during the cease-fire. Israel was forced to request a cease-fire due to the resistance's capabilities. We faced unprecedented aggression, stood firm and broke Israel's strength. Sacrifice is the path to dignity and the resistance will continue.' 'There’s no specific timeline dictating the resistance’s actions — not in the agreement, nor with the 60-day timeframe,' he added. 'Our patience may run out before the 60 days, or it might last longer. The resistance's leadership will decide. Our patience hinges on our judgment about the right timing to confront aggression and its violations.' 'The cease-fire agreement obligates Israel to withdraw south of the Litani River. The Lebanese state is responsible for implementing the cease-fire agreement with Israel.' Qassem compared the current scenario to the 1982 Lebanon War. He noted that Israel reached Beirut easily back then, but 'during the 2024 aggression, Israel paid a heavy price without managing to advance more than a few hundred meters south of the Litani. This serves as a deterrent.' Talking about the fall of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria, Qassem said, 'What happened in Syria could have happened in Lebanon and I believe the Syrian people will play a role in the future confrontation with Israel. Resistance is our choice — to liberate the land, defend sovereignty, support Palestine and confront the spread of Israeli occupation. The resistance's leadership decides when and how to resist, using its methods and weapons of choice.' At the end of the month, the 60 days stipulated in the cease-fire agreement for the IDF’s withdrawal from Lebanon will expire. The IDF has already declared that the date wasn’t 'set in stone.' Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, cited a 'source,' on Saturday saying that the Lebanese army’s leadership claimed Israel is 'gradually imposing new rules of engagement and trying to establish its freedom of movement which will remain even after the cease-fire ends.' According to the source, Lebanese army officials received signals from General Jesper Jeffers, head of the U.S.-led cease-fire monitoring mechanism in Lebanon, during his visit to the country, about 'Israel’s intention to extend the cease-fire from 60 to 90 days.' The Lebanese outlet claimed this depended on Israel achieving its goals — ensuring that Hezbollah can’t initiate and launch attacks against the country. IDF officials have recently been considering staying in Lebanon beyond the period set in the cease-fire agreement. However, no decision has been made according to official sources and the matter remains undecided. The IDF is preparing for this possibility, explaining that the decision will depend on the Lebanese side, their conduct and whether their army achieves full control over southern Lebanon. Israel has made it clear that its decisions will be based on developments in Lebanon. If, at the end of the 60 days, the other side fails to uphold the agreement, there would be no reason not to remain deployed in the area. Israeli officials hope the Americans will understand their stance that a timely withdrawal, without Lebanon fulfilling its part, would be problematic. It’s likely the U.S. won’t allow this initiative to collapse.

IDF detains two Israelis crossing into Syria	Police report that two northern Israeli suspects were taken in for further questioning to determine the reason behind their attempted passage Two Israelis living in the northern part of the country were arrested by IDF forces on Saturday after crossing into Syrian territory in a vehicle, the Israel Police reported. They were apprehended driving on a road not far from the border. The two were detained for questioning and taken to the police to continue their investigation. The reasons for their crossing remain unclear, though it is possible they entered Syria out of curiosity or a desire to 'explore.' The possibility that the crossing was for the sake of criminal purposes is also being examined. 'Today, the Israel Police received a report from the IDF about two suspects who were apprehended inside Syrian territory after crossing the border in a vehicle in the northern region,' The police said in a statement.

Security forces report foiled drug-smuggling attempt across Gaza border via UAVs ready to ferry drugs; troops arrest Israeli suspect The IDF and police reported on Saturday foiling a drug-smuggling attempt from Israel into the Gaza Strip using a drone. Overnight, security forces stationed in the sector apprehended a suspect attempting to flee the site where he operated the drone. A search of his vehicle revealed another drone loaded with drugs, prepared for smuggling into Gaza. The suspect, an Israeli citizen of Bedouin descent, was taken into custody along with the confiscated evidence. He has been transferred for investigation by the police’s central unit in the southern district. Smuggling trends escalate Security officials disclosed that this incident is part of a broader trend observed in recent days. While overnight Saturday's attempt was successfully intercepted, 10 smuggling operations succeeded earlier this week. Officials estimate that the contraband likely included drugs or cigarettes, though the exact contents remain unclear due to the smuggled items not being recovered.

Blinken recounts Gaza war, reveals threat that made Netanyahu app...	Outgoing secretary of state in interview recounts October 7, disagreements with Netanyahu, efforts to complete hostage deal and how he thinks the war might end On Saturday, the New York Times published an interview with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken before his end of term on January 20. In it, he spoke among other things on disagreements with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, difficulties in reaching a hostage deal in Gaza and his disappointment of the world that he said forgot what happened on October 7, 2023, too fast. When Blinken assumed office, he believed he'd mediate a historic agreement—normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. 'On October 6 we were very much pursuing normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel. And in fact, I was scheduled to go to Saudi Arabia and Israel on October 10. Obviously, that didn’t happen.' Blinken told the outlet. 'The purpose of that trip was to work on the Palestinian component of any normalization agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel, because we believed and the Saudis also said it was hugely important to make sure that if there was going to be normalization, there was also a pathway toward a Palestinian state.' That trip never took place. Instead, Blinken arrived in Israel during the war's early days to support the embattled ally. 'Since October 7, we’ve had some core goals in mind. I was there. I was in Israel and then in the region five days later. I saw horrors beyond anyone’s imagination inflicted on men, women and children. And we were determined to do everything we could to help ensure that October 7 would never happen again.' Blinken noted that the U.S. aimed to prevent the war from spreading to other countries and fronts, a goal that, in retrospect, has seen limited success. ' We also wanted to make sure that the war wouldn’t spread, the conflict wouldn’t spread to other fronts, to other countries, because that would mean more death and destruction.,' he explained. He added that the U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration wished to protect civilians caught in a war they didn't start and had no power to stop, ensuring they received the aid necessary to survive the terrible conflict. Regarding the effort to prevent a recurrence of October 7, Blinken added, 'I think we’re in a good place. Israel has destroyed Hamas’s military capabilities. It’s eliminated the leadership that was responsible for October 7.' When the interviewer raised criticism of Israel's campaign against Hamas, Blinken responded, 'No one needs to remind me of the suffering, because it’s something that drives me every single day. It’s exactly why we’ve done everything in our power to find a way to get an end to the conflict through getting the hostages back and getting a cease-fire.' When asked if he believed Israel was complying with international law, Blinken noted, 'We, as you know, have looked and continue to look at that in depth. And we put out our own reports on this with our own assessments.' He added, 'When it comes to the actions that Israel has taken, in its just defense in trying to make sure that October 7 never happens again, we’ve said from Day 1 that how Israel does that matters.' 'An entire society that didn’t want any assistance getting to a single Palestinian in Gaza' Blinken recounted his first visit to Israel, just five days after the massacre, and how he 'convinced' Netanyahu to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza despite harsh domestic criticism. 'I spent with my team nine hours in the I.D.F.’s headquarters in Tel Aviv, six stories underground with the Israeli government, including the prime minister, including arguing for hours on end about the basic proposition that the humanitarian assistance needed to get to Palestinians in Gaza.' He explained that the heated debate stemmed from the Israeli public being in a state of total trauma in the days following the massacre. 'You had in Israel in the days after October 7 a totally traumatized society. This wasn’t just the prime minister or a given leader in Israel. This was an entire society that didn’t want any assistance getting to a single Palestinian in Gaza.,' he said. Blinken then shared the ultimatum he gave Netanyahu: 'President Biden was planning to come to Israel a few days later. And in the course of that argument, when I was getting resistance to the proposition of humanitarian assistance getting in, I told the prime minister, I’m going to call the president and tell him not to come if you don’t allow this assistance to start flowing. And I called the president to make sure that he agreed with that, and he fully did,' Blinken said. When he was asked why the U.S. continues to supply Israel with arms that harm Palestinians, especially since Hamas no longer poses a significant threat, he said, 'We have been and we remain fundamentally committed to Israel’s defense.' 'And that means that the support that the United States provides over many administrations, Republican and Democrat, over many years, that support is absolutely vital to making sure that Israel is able to defend itself, that it can deter aggression coming from many other quarters, whether it’s Hezbollah, whether it’s Iran, whether it’s the many Iranian-backed proxies, whether it’s the Houthis, you name it.' Obstacles on the way to a hostage deal Blinken added the fastest way to end the ongoing fighting in Gaza is through a cease-fire agreement that includes the release of hostages. 'There have been two major impediments, and they both go to what drives Hamas.' 'One has been whenever there has been public daylight between the United States and Israel and the perception that pressure was growing on Israel, we’ve seen it: Hamas has pulled back from agreeing to a cease-fire and the release of hostages. And so there are times when what we say in private to Israel where we have a disagreement is one thing and what we’re doing or saying in public may be another.' When asked whether he viewed Netanyahu as a partner — amid reports that he blocked a cease-fire deal in July that could have led to the release of hostages — Blinken responded, ' No, that’s not accurate. What we’ve seen time and again is Hamas not concluding a deal that it should have concluded.' He acknowledged, however, 'There have been times when actions that Israel has taken have, yes, made it more difficult. But there’s been a rationale for those actions, even if they’ve sometimes made getting to a conclusion more difficult.' Alongside his criticism of Israel’s conduct, Blinken also strongly condemned the global community for quickly forgetting what happened on October 7 and who was primarily responsible for the current situation. 'One of the things that I found a little astounding throughout is that for all of the understandable criticism of the way Israel has conducted itself in Gaza, you hear virtually nothing from anyone since October 7 about Hamas. Why there hasn’t been a unanimous chorus around the world for Hamas to put down its weapons, to give up the hostages, to surrender — I don’t know what the answer is to that.' 'Israel, on various occasions has offered safe passage to Hamas’s leadership and fighters out of Gaza. Where is the world? Where is the world, saying, Yeah, do that! End this! Stop the suffering of people that you brought on! Now, again, that doesn’t absolve Israel of its actions in conducting the war. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'But I do have to question how it is that we haven’t seen a greater sustained condemnation and pressure on Hamas to stop what it started and to end the suffering of people that it initiated.' Blinken added he believed the war would end under conditions outlined by Biden last year. ' If we don’t have the opportunity to start to try to implement it through a hostage cease-fire agreement in the next couple of weeks, we will hand it off to the incoming Trump administration, and they can decide whether to move forward with it,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk2tm08iyg	2025-01-04T07:09:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/12/SJZwuoErWa/SJZwuoErWa_1_21_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Hamas releases video showing sign of life from hostage Liri Albag	Terror group releases clip as attempts at psychological warfare after previous footage of the IDF lookout was released in May; Family prohibits publication of video Hamas on Saturday released a video on Saturday showing a sign of life from IDF lookout Liri Albag, who was abducted on October 7, 2023. At her family's request, Ynet isn’t publishing the video, an image from it or the statements made in it at this time. Liri was abducted from the Nahal Oz base during her first Saturday on duty after completing her basic training, alongside four other lookouts: Karina Ariev, Agam Berger, Daniella Gilboa and Naama Levy. Liri’s mother, Shira Albag, shared the moments of terror at the base and the last messages she received from her daughter in a previous interview with Ynet. 'At 6:30 a.m., she called me and said, 'Mom, there’s a crazy rocket attack here. We jumped out of bed, there wasn’t even an alarm. We’re in the shelter.' I also heard the explosions in the background; no one here knew anything yet. I asked her if she was okay and she answered, 'Everything's fine, people are alive here. We’re in the shelter.' 'She sent me a picture and I saw it was open on both sides. I told her it wasn’t a proper shelter. Liri responded, 'Mom, it’s fine. Everyone’s here, all the girls. Don’t worry.' In hindsight, I learned that most of the girls were saying their goodbyes to their families during that time. She didn’t say goodbye — she reassured everyone that everything was fine.' Last May, the hostages’ families allowed the public release of footage from the Nahal Oz base, as recorded by the body cameras of Hamas terrorists on October 7. The released version was edited, shortened and censored from the full footage. It shows the five lookouts being handcuffed by their captors. Later, the terrorists filmed themselves leading the five to a vehicle amid the sound of heavy gunfire in the background. The video released by Hamas, which the family has declined to authorize for publication at this stage, follows a series of footage and proofs of life shared by terrorist organizations in Gaza in recent weeks.

Biden's last hoorah: $8 billion weapons package to Israel is in t...	The U.S. plans to approve an arms package for Israel, including artillery shells, precision bombs, and GPS systems, though production and delivery could take years; Meanwhile, heavy bombs and bulldozer shipments face delays due to concerns over impact on civilians in Gaza In what may be one of President Joe Biden’s final actions before leaving the White House, the Biden administration announced its intention to approve an $8 billion arms deal with Israel. On Saturday morning, The New York Times reported that the U.S. State Department had 'informally' notified Congress of the proposed deal. The deal reportedly includes artillery shells, small-diameter bombs, munitions for fighter jets and helicopters, and GPS-guided bomb systems. However, many of the munitions in the package are not intended for immediate use, as production is expected to begin soon. Delivery to Israel could take years. In the coming weeks, congressional committees are expected to review the deal and raise questions with the U.S. State Department. If concerns arise, these committees have the authority to delay the arms transfer. Despite this announcement, the U.S. is still withholding the shipment of approximately 1,300 heavy bombs for the Israeli Air Force, which Israel had purchased from Boeing with Israeli funds rather than U.S. aid. Each bomb weighs close to a ton. The U.S. has expressed concerns that the Israeli military might use these bombs in ways that could harm civilian populations. While half of the shipment—previously frozen by the Biden administration—has been delivered to the Israeli military, the other half remains in storage in the United States. Just over a month ago, and less than 24 hours after a ceasefire agreement in Lebanon was announced, President Biden approved a $680 million arms deal with Israel. At that time, American officials informed Congress of plans to supply additional Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kits to Israel, which convert unguided bombs into precision-guided munitions, as well as small-diameter bombs. A week earlier, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly rejected three proposals introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders, a Jewish progressive leader in the Democratic Party (Technically independent, but caucuses with the Democrats) and a prominent critic of Israel. These proposals called for halting weapons transfers to Israel following the war in Gaza, including tank shells, mortar bombs, and JDAM kits. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: All senators who supported the proposals were Democrats, while members from both parties voted against them. The Biden administration opposed the measures, stating in a letter to Democratic senators prior to the vote that 'providing military equipment to Israel is an investment in its long-term security as it faces threats from Iran and elsewhere.' The letter also noted that 'the administration is continually working to improve conditions in Gaza.' Around two months ago, Ynet revealed new details about the freeze on U.S. arms shipments to the Israeli military. One of the items requested for ground forces—a shipment of 134 D9 bulldozers—has been delayed at Caterpillar factories in the United States, awaiting an export permit from the State Department in Washington. Israel had already ordered and paid for the shipment. The use of these bulldozers, primarily for demolishing structures in Gaza, has prompted significant internal criticism in the U.S., protests, and immense pressure on the Biden administration. As a result, the shipment has been frozen for several months. The impact is already being felt on the ground: according to Ynet inquiries, dozens of existing D9 bulldozers—heavily used in Israeli military operations in Gaza between November 2023 and mid-2024—are now in urgent need of maintenance. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r14mw888jx	2025-01-03T21:56:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/04/H1PSgL8L1g/H1PSgL8L1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

US General Jasper Jeffers praises LAF professionalism in cease-fi...	General Jeffers, who heads the cease-fire mechanism in Lebanon, praised the Lebanese army's dedication; Hezbollah announces it would refrain from escalation American General Jasper Jeffers, who heads the mechanism for supervising the cease-fire agreement in Lebanon, visited the south of the country on Friday and expressed satisfaction with the conduct of the Lebanese army. 'I am incredibly impressed by the professionalism and dedication of the LAF. They are working around the clock to provide security and dismantle unexploded ordnance so Lebanese citizens can safely return home.' In the last few weeks, the LAF cleared over 9800 pieces of explosive ordnance from more than 80 locations,' he said. Meanwhile, Lebanese media outlets reported an expected visit by the American envoy, Amos Hochstein, to Beirut on Monday. According to the Qatari newspaper 'Al-Arabi Al-Jadeed', Hochstein will be engaged in a dual mission: monitoring the implementation of the cease-fire agreement alongside discussions regarding the presidential elections in Lebanon. According to the Lebanese newspaper Al-Jumhuriya, an important meeting of the committee supervising the cease-fire agreement will be held this coming Monday in Naqoura. Sources said that the meeting will be chaired by Hochstein which may send a message of seriousness regarding the implementation of the agreement. At the same time, parliamentary sources told the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat that Hezbollah will continue to maintain self-restraint and will not be drawn into a military escalation against Israel. On Thursday, Air Force fighter jets destroyed Hezbollah medium-range rocket launchers in Lebanese territory. Arab media outlets reported three attacks in southern Lebanon. Earlier, an Iranian plane was reported to have landed at Beirut airport with money intended for Hezbollah and was detained by local authorities. In addition, the IDF reportedly attacked security facilities in Aleppo, Syria.

His suitcase, according to the report, was checked at the airport. The channel added that a US diplomat who landed in Beirut today was similarly checked. Lebanese Interior Minister Bassam Molawi later clarified in a conversation with the channel that the activities of the Interior Ministry and the airport security apparatus are intended to protect Lebanon. According to the minister, it was decided to carry out a check on all diplomats landing in the country, in a routine procedure.

The Prisoner’s Dilemma: The question of Marwan Barghouti	Amid the ongoing hostage and cease-fire negotiations with Hamas, Israel considers to release Marwan Barghouti in the prisoner exchange despite his deep involvement in Palestinian terrorism 'We are not familiar with the information provided by the media on the possibility that Marwan Barghouti will be released as part of the deal and exiled to Turkey', stated his son, Qassam in an interview. One week since his return from Qatar, where his family reportedly discussed the possibility of including his father in the deal with senior Hamas officials, he shared: 'We are comparatively more optimistic. As a family, we don’t care where he is released to, it can even be to Kuala-Lumpur'. An 'Israeli senior official' responded to the media reports on the subject swiftly and decidedly, stating: 'There is no discussion of Barghouti being released'. The dilemma whether or not to release Barghouti - One of the senior leaders of Fatah - has been deliberated for over two decades, and has received greater attention since October 7, as the chances of his release as part of a deal for the release of security prisoners in exchange for Israeli hostages held in Gaza seem to be growing. Over the years, it has been argued among in Israeli politics and media that Barghouti is a leader with considerable clout, and that, despite his involvement in terror attacks during the Second Intifada that killed 5, for which he has been sentenced to life in prison, he remains true to the peace negotiations, and is expected to pursue a two-state solution. Others claim that he is a 'mini-Arafat', whose loyalties lie with militarism, and who will surely advance a violent struggle upon his release. Barghouti is both a national symbol and a mystery. This 65-year-old leader, who was born in Kufr Kobar, a village near Ramallah, represents the generation that grew up in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the 1970s and 1980s, forming a defiant alternative for the founding generation headed by Arafat, who came from Tunisia and took over the Palestinian Authority. Like many of his peers, he too knows Israel well, speaks Hebrew, and has held many meetings with Israelis prior to the Second Intifada. The mystery stems from the fact that, although he has been absent for over two decades (nearly one third of his life), Marwan Barghouti remains the most popular candidate for leading the Palestinian system. Public opinion polls conducted over the past decade have consistently shown him to beat any other candidate in any election scenario, including Hamas representatives. Many Palestinians explain this strange phenomenon by claiming that the people look up to 'Barghouti the symbol', despite being unfamiliar with 'Marwan the man'. The public at large, and particularly the younger generation, born after he had been incarcerated, view him as the epiphany of national ideals, primarily resistance and sacrifice. Hamas is equally aware of the potential Barghouti harbors, and it is no surprise, therefore, that they, too, insist that he be released. In their view, this could yield two gains for the terror organization: establishing an image of the war spurred by Hamas as a national campaign that has led to achievements for all Palestinians; and the return to the playing field of a beloved leader who, unlike most senior Palestinian Authority officials, shares similar views to those of Hamas, and with whom reconciliation may be reached, which would enable the terror organization to gain much-coveted presence in the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority is fostering a more ambivalent approach toward Barghouti. Publicly, its senior officials support his release from Israeli prison, yet many in Ramallah are concerned about the possibility that he would become a dominant rival in the race for Abu Mazen’s throne, and worry that he will promote a reconciliation with Hamas. 'Barghouti’s release will be bad news for Israel, but also for many who enjoy his very presence', remarked a senior Fatah official in Nablus Hussam Khader sardonically, while Fadwa, Barghouti’s wife, chose her words carefully: 'The Palestinian Authority itself is interested in Barghouti’s release, but some parties are not so inclined, and are not true Palestinian patriots'. Israel’s primary concern over Barghouti’s possible release is that he will use his freedom to promote violence. The assessment that he will do so is based, inter alia, on statements he has issued while in prison glorifying the armed struggle. His son, Qassam, however, said: 'They are scaring you for nothing. My father is the ultimate partner for Israel, he is true to the two-state vision, has garnered support across the Palestinian public, and can serve as a stable, uniting, and agreed point of contact for the Palestinian side'. Although Israel denies it, Barghouti may indeed be released, and reintegrated once more into the Palestinian system very soon, whether he is exiled overseas, returns to the West Bank, or, in the less likely turn of events, ends up in Gaza. Israel fears that, upon his release, Barghouti will advocate violence, while pursuing reconciliation with Hamas, forcing Israel to take action, particularly if he will be back in the West Bank. Yet a more complex scenario will generate a second 'Jolani dilemma', meaning an attempt on Barghouti’s part to appear moderate like Syria`s current ruler - including engaging in direct talks with Western and Israeli officials - while keeping them wondering whether it is merely a smokescreen masking an extremist’s vision. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Even if Barghouti will not be included in the deal, he is expected to affect the Palestinian sphere, and, in turn, Israel too. He is determined to run for the presidency in any future Palestinian elections, even from within prison walls. In the seemingly likely event that he will win them; Israel will be subject to heavy international pressure. Such a development could also lead to protest and confusion within the Palestinian Authority as it finds itself being led by a man who is being imprisoned by the very country against which he is calling his people to fight, while engaging in close civil and security coordination with Israel. Be it from prison or the squares of Ramallah, it seems the name Barghouti will be on the lips of both nations, the Middle East, and the international community for a long time to come.

How Hamas uses hospitals for its benefit and the ensuing criticis...	Hamas uses Gaza hospitals as base of operations and interrogations as a tactic, 'They can suddenly take over a ward,' testifies a Gazan resident; Gazan reporter criticized Hamas Recently, Hamas' use of hospitals in the Gaza Strip has made headlines after the IDF exposed the terror organization. During the operation at Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya, about 240 terrorists were arrested, the largest arrest throughout the war, including the hospital director, Hussam Abu Safiya, who according to the IDF is suspected of being a Hamas operative. In a particularly unusual step, Israel decided to seal the hospital after the operation and put it out of use, preventing it from being used again by Hamas. On previous occasions when the IDF raided hospitals in Gaza, it allowed the continuation of operations there afterward. For example, on November 15, 2023, the IDF raided Shifa for the first time and found weapons, a tunnel shaft, explosives, and evidence that hostages were held there in the first days of the war. After the IDF withdrew from the site, the hospital returned to being used by Hamas and Islamic Jihad members. Immediately after the IDF withdrew for the first time, sources in the Gaza Strip say, Hamas called on a very large number of civilians to return to the hospital buildings and its courtyards, promising to distribute aid. During this time, hundreds of weapons were brought in under the assumption that IDF forces would not return to the complex. 'Specific rooms in the hospital buildings became military and security management centers,' sources in the Gaza Strip said. 'Daily meetings were held for Hamas and Jihad members in the hospital corridors. The Israeli forces monitored all these movements from the air, but Hamas continued military activity from the hospital.' On March 18 2024, IDF forces returned to Shifa in a surprise raid, in which more than 200 terrorists were eliminated and hundreds more were arrested. According to the IDF spokesperson, weapons were found hidden between patient beds in the maternity ward, along with mortar bombs, IEDs and sniper weapons. Since then, Hamas has reportedly restored the hospital which has resumed operations. Hussam Yahya, a presenter for the Qatari Al Jazeera network, admitted that Hamas used Shifa, but claimed that it emboldens the population. 'It is a living nightmare for Israel's goal of emptying Gaza and the north. The hospital miraculously returned to work after its destruction. A meeting of clan leaders was held there, which resulted in a 'statement rejecting cooperation with Israel.' In short, the very presence of Shifa is a defeat for Israel,' Yahya stated. In the comments, some wondered: 'Why gather in a hospital? You idiots.' There are currently 23 hospitals operating in the Gaza Strip, including 13 field hospitals established by the international community, in coordination with the COGAT unit. Also, 10 additional hospitals in the Strip receive supplies from Israel, including equipment and food. Hamas's use of hospitals was not limited to medical treatment. Throughout the war, the terror organization has repeated the transgression, without regard for the population that increasingly needs medical treatments that have been reduced in response to IDF raids. In Gaza, this fact is well known, but there is no one to rise up, for now. 'There are medical personnel who are related to terrorists. These are Hamas' key people in all the hospitals. On any day they can arrive, take over an entire ward without anyone objecting to it. They arrive, close a ward, and the doctor is one of their own,' a Gazan resident told Ynet. 'Before the war, everything was open to them, but the takeover of the hospitals was noticeable. At any given moment, it was possible to shut down an entire hospital without regard for mothers, the sick or the wounded. This is how a terrorist organization behaves, and there is no one to stop it.' 'Most government institutions have been destroyed and the hospitals are used for meetings of police, security and aid personnel. 'Everything is done there, it's the safest place.' Recently, the IDF disclosed Hamas has used Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. About a year ago, Hamas police summoned a man who heads an aid-smuggling gang in the Al-Qararah area of Khan Yunis for questioning. The summons was issued on October 16, and it was clearly stated that the place of questioning was the hospital. On social media, Fatah supporters wondered: 'Why does the enemy bomb hospitals or schools that house refugees? There are people in the Gaza Strip who give them an opportunity and an excuse. Summoning people to the Nasser Hospital is just a call for the enemy to bomb the patients.' These days, the use of hospitals has become more necessary for Hamas which has lost government infrastructure one after another. 'From Hamas' perspective, the air force will not bomb a hospital full of displaced and sick people. The population inside must first be evacuated, and Hamas knows this very well,' said sources in Gaza. 'Now that most of the government institutions that Hamas used before the war have been demolished, it is also using them for meetings of police officers, security personnel, and for aid matters. Everything is conducted there. This is the safest place for them.' Israeli security sources commented. 'The terrorist organizations, led by Hamas, are trying to deflect public criticism of the organization's cynical exploitation of civilian institutions and hospitals onto IDF forces,' they said, and claimed: 'Hamas fears public criticism and protests against it, and therefore it is spreading misleading and false narratives on social media to pressure Israel through the international community.' Unprecedented criticism from a journalist: 'People are dying of cold in tents' The IDF's activity at the Kamal Adwan Hospital began to sway Hamas supporters in the past week. In a recording published on social media, Al-Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif, who is considered one of Hamas's top aides, criticized the organization's negotiators, saying: 'The public could have prevented what is happening in the northern Gaza Strip and prevented the destruction and damage to the hospitals. But Hamas, which is conducting the talks, is not interested in the public, and the organization continues to use slogans.' Sharif criticized the ongoing rounds of negotiations, and mentioned the suffering of the residents of the Gaza Strip. 'Hamas' claims about being flexibile in the talks are not at all interesting to the public. It is impossible to continue dragging out the ceasefire talks. The public is suffering, stop haggling over the terms of the deal. We express opposition and protest against Hamas, which is making cynical use of the situation leading to the invasion of the IDF forces into the region.' In a tweet he later published, Sharif wrote: 'The war must end immediately. We do not want what happened in the north of the Gaza Strip to be repeated in Gaza City. Gaza is drowning in sadness, loss, oppression, and pain in the face of the world's abandonment. I swear, we are dying from the cold and the winds when we are in tents.'

UNRWA reportedly preparing to cease activities in Gaza, West Bank	U.N. officials say they are preparing to shutter UNRWA operations,' the New York Times reports Friday; Decision comes after Knesset passed two pieces of legislation that bars the agency's activities on Israeli territory, such as coordinating with the IDF; UNRWA supports say this will deal a fatal blow to the Palestinians UN officials told The New York Times that UNRWA , the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, is preparing to cease its activities in Gaza and the West Bank. The report comes about two months after the Knesset passed two pieces of legislation banning the organization's activities in its territory, and which went into effect this month. After the Hamas massacre on October 7, 2023, there was criticism in Israel against UNRWA over the involvement of some of its employees in the deadly attack. A UN investigation confirmed that nine of the organization's employees did indeed take an active part in the events and cooperated with Hamas. In light of the findings, the Knesset approved laws prohibiting UNRWA from operating in its territory. These laws, which will come into effect this month, prevent any cooperation with the organization. This will limit the organization's ability to continue its activities in the West Bank and Gaza, which require coordination with the IDF. 'It would be a massive impact on an already catastrophic situation,' Jamie McGoldrick, who oversaw the U.N. humanitarian operation across Gaza and the West Bank until April, told the New York Times. 'If that is what the Israeli intention is — to remove any ability for us to save lives — you have to question what is the thinking and what is the end goal?' UNRWA supporters claim that the cessation of operations would be a fatal blow to the Palestinian population. 'The world has abandoned us. We have nothing but the aid we get from UNRWA to survive,' Sami Abu Darweesh, 30, who lives in a refugee camp in southern Gaza run by UNRWA, told the newspaper. 'If that stops, what will we do?' 'We gave the government 90 days, and, actually, the entire world 90 days,' said Yuli Edelstein, the chairman of the parliamentary committee that drafted the UNRWA bills.

Knesset lawmaker Dan Illouz of the Likud, who was one of the initiators of the law against UNRWA, said: 'We succeeded! The historic law that I initiated to disconnect UNRWA from Israel is proving itself. The world is beginning to understand that UNRWA is an arm of Hamas and not an aid organization. Its employees were complicit in the October 7 massacre, its institutions hid weapons, and it educated generations of terrorists. Now, with its collapse, we are striking at the heart of the terror apparatus.' 'Israel has taken the first step – now the world must complete it. UNRWA must not only be reduced, it must disappear. This is a huge achievement for Israel’s security and the fight against terrorism!' said Illouz. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjpid8sike	2025-01-03T04:24:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/02/S1ec6Gj7kl/S1ec6Gj7kl_0_165_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Why isn’t Lebanon standing up to Hezbollah?	Alma Center’s Sarit Zehavi says the Lebanese army has not changed it approach to the terror organization The Lebanese army is not standing up to Hezbollah as Israel had hoped, according to Sarit Zehavi, founder of the Alma Center. 'We don’t feel the opponents to Hezbollah in Lebanon changed their point of view, changed their approach, and truly understand that Hezbollah is different, that Israel caused huge damages to Hezbollah, and now is the time to stand up against it,' Zehavi told ILTV News. 'We don't see this happening enough.' She noted that when the Lebanese want to stand up against something, they know how to do it. 'They know how to go out to the streets,' Zehavi said. 'It is happening mainly in the social media, but not in the streets and not by the Lebanese army itself.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjckfwhi1l	2025-01-03T04:15:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/BJGECHDZL1x/BJGECHDZL1x_1_157_1601_901_0_small.jpg
Gaza terrorists fire shoulder-launched missile at Israeli Air For...	The attack, which missed the helicopter, set off sirens at Kibbutz Be'eri for the first time in 10 months; 2 rockets also were launched from Gaza at Sderot and the vicinity; It is the eighth day in a row that sirens warning of rocket attacks have sounded in the Gaza envelope Rocket alert sirens sounded in Kibbutz Be'eri for the first time in 10 months on Friday following surface-to-air missile fired from Gaza; the shoulder-launched missile was fired at an Israeli Air Force helicopter over Gaza. This was followed Friday morning by two rockets launched at Sderot around noon. One of them exploded near Kibbutz Nir Am, the other fell in an open area. The Sderot municipality said that residents reported shrapnel on a local streets, and noted that there were no reports of any injuries or property damage. Footage from the municipal soccer stadium shows the explosions as many people watch the match there. An hour and a half before the sirens in Sderot, the alarms were sounded in Be'ari. They were triggered by a shoulder-launched missile fired by Hamas terrorists in the northern Gaza Strip at an Israeli Air Force helicopter. The missile did not hit or endanger the aircraft, which continued its operations, but since the missile was fired toward Israeli territory the alarm was sounded in Be'eri. This is the eighth consecutive day that an alert siren has sounded in the enclave. The last time there was a siren in Be'eri following rocket fire from Gaza was in March, almost 10 months ago. Since then, an alarm has sounded in the evacuated kibbutz only once, during the Iranian attack in early October.

Greenland's leader steps up push for independence from Denmark	Greenland's Prime Minister Mute Egede emphasised his desire to pursue independence from Denmark, its former colonial ruler, during his New Year speech, marking a significant change in the rhetoric surrounding the Arctic island's future. Egede's speech, which comes on the heels of comments by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump expressing his wish for 'ownership and control' of Greenland, also expressed a desire to strengthen Greenland's cooperation with other countries. 'It is about time that we ourselves take a step and shape our future, also with regard to who we will cooperate closely with, and who our trading partners will be,' he said. An independence movement has gained traction in Greenland in recent years in part due to revelations of misconduct by Danish authorities during the 20th century, including an involuntary birth control campaign launched in the 1960s. Greenland was a Danish colony until 1953 but is now a self-governing territory of Denmark and in 2009 achieved the right to claim independence through a vote. In 2023, Greenland's government presented its first draft constitution. While a majority of Greenland's 57,000 inhabitants support independence, there is division over the timing and potential impact on living standards. Greenland's government has twice rejected offers by Trump to purchase the island, in 2019 and again last year, with Egede asserting that 'Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjxkciblje	2025-01-03T03:37:49-08:00	
German, French foreign ministers meet Syria's new rulers in Damas...	The foreign ministers of Germany and France said they wanted to forge a new relationship with Syria and urged a peaceful transition as they met its de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus on Friday on behalf of the European Union. Germany's Annalena Baerbock and France's Jean-Noel Barrot are the first ministers from the EU to visit Syria since rebels seized control of Damascus on Dec. 8 and forced President Bashar al-Assad to flee after more than 13 years of civil war, ending his family's decades-long rule. The French and German ministers met Sharaa in the Damascus People's Palace, but so far no details of their talks have been made public. Barrot similarly expressed his hope for a 'sovereign and safe' Syria that would leave no room for terrorism, chemical weapons or malign foreign actors, during a meeting with representatives from Syrian civil society organisations. Germany and France plan to offer their technical help and advice to Syria as the country drafts a new constitution, Barrot told journalists, saying that hope for the country's democratic transition was 'fragile but real'. He called for a political solution for Kurdish fighters in Syria to be integrated into the Syrian state, adding that a permanent ceasefire must be achieved, but he did not respond when asked when the EU could lift sanctions on Syria. Barrot also visited the French embassy, which has been closed since 2012, where he said France would work towards re-establishing diplomatic representation in line with political and security conditions, diplomatic sources said. As part of their visit, the ministers took a tour of Syria's most notorious prison, the vast Sednaya complex. 'Now it's up to the international community to help to bring justice to the people who have suffered here in this prison of hell,' Baerbock said.

Take me, al Golani: New Syrian leader wooed by many	Ahmad al-Sharaa is least likely to align himself with Russia, and he needs legitimacy and funding from the West including the lifting of sanctions to allow trade and foreign investments Nearly one month after the fall of the Assad regime, the new leaders of Syria are facing many challenges as they prepare for the establishment of a committee for national dialogue that will compose a new constitution and government that they hope will unite Syria's fractured society. Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, is well aware of the need to present a clean image to the West if he hopes to receive legitimacy for his rule. But while he exhibits himself as someone who seeks peace, his past in al-Qaida still overshadows many of his promises for the future. Many countries are still involved in events in Syria and the flow of leaders to Damascus continues. On Friday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock arrived after representatives from Ukraine, the U.S., Turkey and Qatar, among others, visited the Syrian capital. Russia, which alongside Iran had propped up the Assad regime and was directly responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of Syrians, has also been trying to woo the new leadership even though it is hosting the deposed Syrian dictator in Moscow. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier this week that Syria is a 'sovereign nation' and has the right to end agreements signed with international partners, but added that there has been no request from the new leadership for Russia to remove its bases in Syria. He said the establishment of the Russian bases were agreed through international treaties and in accordance with international law but there was no doubt that the regime change in Damascus would require certain adjustments regarding Russia's military presence in Syria, which could be negotiated by the parties. Al-Sharaa said in an interview to Saudi media that Syria has strategic interests with Russia and that he hoped Moscow would not leave in a manner that was not compatible with the bilateral relations. But it does not appear that the new Syrian leader has doubts whether to align himself with the West or the Russians. Moscow is not a real option for him. Professor Eyal Zisser, an expert on Syria and Lebanon and the vice rector of Tel Aviv University, said he believes Al Sharaa will not lean on Russia but does not want a fight with the Russians. 'He wants to project himself as moderate,' Zisser said. 'He does not want confrontation and has enough troubles. Israel has deployed troops in Syria, Iran and Hezbollah are lurking in the corner. He wants to end things with Moscow on a positive note.' Zisser believes there is an open historic account for the Syrian opposition forces with Russia, which was quick to provide a sanctuary for Bashar Assad. 'The United States can more easily reach agreements with Al Sharaa than Russia, which is still weary of Islamist groups, can. The new regime needs money to rebuild and rehabilitate Syria. Assad relied heavily on revenue from the drug trade and a new source of income is now needed. 'He needs Qatar, the Gulf nations, the U.S. and the West,' Zisser says. 'He needs sanctions lifted so that there can be trade and investments as well as financial assistance.' Qatar, aware of those needs, began establishing its position in Syria soon after the Assad regime fell, by transferring funds and ensuring its involvement in any future process. Al Sharaa's rebranding as a moderate has been helpful to portray Islam as more than terrorism. As in its dealings in Gaza, Doha appears to be providing assistance, but has other interests as well and is using its close ties to Turkey to achieve them. Turkey, which has been fighting the Kurds in northern Syria for years, has two main interests. One is the return home of Syrian refugees that have sought shelter within its borders, and the other is the fight against the Kurds who under the auspices of the U.S. and Syrian opposition forces (SDF) have taken control of large areas in northern and eastern Syria. 'Our goal is to solve the crisis in the northeast,' Al Sharaa said in the interview. 'The Kurds are an inseparable part of the Syrian population and their forces will be incorporated in the Syrian defense forces.' Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Ankara would not accept the Kurds from the PKK Party – identified as a terror group, and a majority of Kurdish fighters in SDF as legitimate representatives of Syria. This will challenge Al Sharaa to decide where his alliances lie. 'The new Syrian regime is heavily reliant on Turkey to rebuild the country after Assad,' said Dr. Galia Lindenstrauss, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS). 'Al Sharaa would likely choose to establish his leadership before he takes on the Kurds in a fight. ' Turkey has financial problems of its own and cannot allot funds for the Syrians, but may rely on its alliance with Qatar, she said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Saudi Arabia is also working on its ties with the new regime. 'Riyadh wants stability in Syria and has a central role to play,' Al Sharaa said. 'I hope Iran reconsiders its involvement in the region. We are seeking balanced relations with everyone and Iran must align itself with the Syrian people.' Whether or not Al Sharaa has really changed is unclear even to the many diplomats who met with him. Officials in Israel are concerned that he may be fooling the West and insist Israel's hold on the Syrian part of Mt. Hermon and the buffer zone on the Golan Heights will continue until things become clear. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk08x8sljg	2025-01-03T03:30:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/03/S1IlMNrLyg/S1IlMNrLyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

How Israel’s biotech ecosystem is pioneering drug development	Noam Solomon: 'We have so many startups and IT companies succeeding, and we can tap into this, source amazing talent' Israel is not the global leader in biotechnology, but it is a major player in the field. According to two biotech entrepreneurs and experts, there are compelling reasons why people turn to the Jewish state for innovation. What sets Israel apart was a key theme of the 'Light of Innovation' panel at the Lights of Hope virtual event, presented this week by ILTV and Ynet News. One factor is Israel’s exceptional engineering talent, according to Noam Solomon, Co-founder and CEO of Immunai. 'We have technological units such as 8200 that create an amazing ecosystem. We have so many startups and IT companies succeeding, and we can tap into this, source amazing talent,' Solomon said. Another advantage, he explained, is Israel’s culture. Israelis have a strong mentality of 'getting things done.' The panel also featured Karin Noy, who leads the Emerging Science & Innovation in Israel portfolio for Pfizer. She highlighted Israel’s robust academic research and a well-integrated healthcare system. This system links medical providers and health insurance companies, creating a comprehensive and valuable patient data set. 'If you think about the drug development process, it's so complicated,' said Noy. 'We are starting from the discovery of new targets and then for those targets we need to validate them, we need to identify molecules and design them. And then on the translational side, to find how to match them to the right patients and then to take them to advanced clinical trials' until they are eventually commercialized. It’s a complex process, she emphasized, which is why Pfizer collaborates with small, innovative companies in Israel to address these challenges. Developing a drug today can take more than a decade and cost over $2 billion. Furthermore, 95% of investments fail. According to Solomon, the primary reason is that human immune systems respond differently to therapeutics than mice. Immunai addressed this issue by mapping and building an AI model of the immune system, allowing it to predict immune responses to therapeutics. AI, Solomon said, is unlocking insights that were previously unattainable in drug development and patient care. Using its model, Immunai has been able to determine the optimal dosage for drugs. 'Just knowing that a molecule could work is not enough; it's not a therapy. You need to decide what is the dose, what is the schedule [for taking it],' Solomon explained. 'With AI and our predictive modeling, we're able to optimize those.' For example, Immunai has used its model to find the best combination agent for oncology drugs. This includes determining which chemotherapy or anti-drug conjugate to pair with an immune agent. Pfizer is also involved in another groundbreaking AI initiative: AION Labs. AION Labs is an Israeli venture studio formed in partnership with AstraZeneca, Merck, Pfizer, Teva, the Israel Biotech Fund, Amiti Ventures, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Supported by BioMed X and the Israel Innovation Authority, its mission is to develop AI technologies that revolutionize drug discovery and improve global health. Since October 7 and the start of the regional war, eight companies have been launched through AION Labs. 'The majority are already in partnership with Pfizer, and we’re working on validating the technology,' Noy said. 'It's very impressive, especially in a small country like Israel… It's the only place where competitive companies like this could get together.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byg2aes8jl	2025-01-03T01:45:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/03/HJB5yBBUkl/HJB5yBBUkl_20_0_777_437_0_small.jpg

Israel's war in Iran's planetary mixers, producing solid rocket f...	Planetary mixers critical for Iran's missile production, averts the need for on-sight fueling of projectiles, enhances precision and range of missiles; IDF images of mixers in destroyed facility in Syria reveals them for the first time to the public The IDF's revelation of the Israeli commando raid on the Iranian missile production facility used by Hezbollah in Masyaf, located in Syria’s Hama province, was the first time an image a planetary mixer, a vital component used to blend solid rocket fuel components together, was exposed to the public. Solid rocket fuel enables missiles to be launched without the need for on-site fueling, a process requiring them to be removed from underground shelters and raised upright for nearly an hour—making them easily detectable by satellites and other intelligence tools. Solid fuel also significantly enhances a missile's range and precision. The planetary mixes precisely combine materials into a homogeneous compound for solid rocket fuel production. In the raid involving 100 commando special forces, the facility that was intended for the production of hundreds of precision missiles a year, was destroyed and with it, industrial mixers. Initially the forced did not plan to completely destroy the facility but only the planetary mixers without which solid fuel could not be produced. Israel has been on the hunt to destroy Iran's planetary mixers since 2019, when a drone attack was carried out on the Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut where it was awaiting transportation to one of the missile production sites the terror group had built in the area. According to Lebanese reports, a year later, the IDF navy attacked a vessel that was delivering an alternative planetary mixer to replace the one that was destroyed. Planetary mixers, that were almost exclusively in the possession of superpowers – have become some of Israel's main targets in its war against the Shiite axis. After Israel's strike on Iran on October 26, at least a dozen of them were destroyed, pushing Iran's missile production back at least two years. Each planetary mixer costs in the area of $2 million. Currently there are one or two planetary mixers estimated to be in use by members of the Shiite axis and are in the possession of the Houthi rebels.

Former US serviceman indicted for attempting to join Hezbollah	Jack Danaher Molloy, 24, travels to Lebanon and Syria in 2024 in effort to join terror group, charged with making false statement to FBI ; promotes hates, violence against Jews on social media; could face 20 years in prison A Pennsylvania man who previously served in the U.S. Army was indicted by a grand jury on charges of attempting to support Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and of making false statements to the FBI, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday. Jack Danaher Molloy, 24, was a dual citizen of the U.S. and Ireland and traveled to Lebanon and Syria in 2024 to attempt to join Hezbollah, which is designated by the U.S. as a 'foreign terrorist organization,' the Justice Department said in a statement. The department said Molloy returned to the U.S. in late 2024 and continued making attempts to join Hezbollah. He had also promoted hatred and violence against Jews, the Justice Department said, adding he was formerly enlisted as an active-duty soldier in the U.S. Army from mid-March to late April in 2019. The Justice Department said Molloy lied to the FBI about his intentions to join Hezbollah when questioned upon his return to the United States in late 2024. It said he was arrested on Dec. 6 in Chicago. If convicted, Molloy faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for a material support charge. For false statement charges, he faces a maximum penalty of eight years in prison, a $250,000 fine, or both. A representative of Molloy could not immediately be contacted.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkhx4wr81e	2025-01-02T21:52:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/27/Hyl2g3EQJe/Hyl2g3EQJe_0_277_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

The ground trembled': IDF unveils detail of heroic IDF commando ...	With heavy aerial cover and amid intense danger, 100 IDF commandos landed in Syria in order to dismantle an Iranian missile production facility that was on the verge of becoming operational The IDF’s daring commando operation to destroy a newly constructed underground missile production facility in Syria was revealed in full detail on Thursday. The IDF disclosed new and extensive information about the heroic operation carried out on the night of September 8. In a rare ground raid, Israeli Air Force (IAF) commandos from the Shaldag Unit targeted the massive facility built by Iran near the town of Masyaf, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) from Israel, deep inside Syria. 30 Syrian guards eliminated The facility was on the verge of full industrial production, capable of manufacturing 150 to 300 large, precision-guided missiles annually for Hezbollah, Bashar Assad’s regime and pro-Iranian forces in Syria. This development aimed to bypass the weapon smuggling routes from Iran through Iraq and Syria to Lebanon, which the IDF frequently targeted. Commandos discovered eight preliminary rocket engines already produced on-site but, as the facility had yet to begin full operations, its destruction at this stage was critical to prevent it from becoming a fortified and much harder target. On the night of the strike, approximately 30 Syrian soldiers guarded the facility. Most were eliminated in preliminary airstrikes by IAF fighter jets and helicopters seven minutes before the Shaldag commandos landed. Four more soldiers were neutralized at close range by the commandos on the ground. None of the IDF operatives were injured and the mission was deemed a resounding success. The mission was personally presented by Lt. Col. B., the Shaldag Unit’s commander, to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. After approval from IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and IAF Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar, the operation was launched. Lasting three hours under the cover of night, the takeover of the underground complex was executed in precisely 18 minutes from the moment the helicopters touched down in Syria. Dozens of additional Syrian soldiers were deployed to the site an hour later but were either attacked or fled after realizing the area was secured by a formidable force. Reinforcements included motorbike riders and troops in jeeps. Hundreds of additional Syrian soldiers arrived approximately an hour after the Israeli forces had withdrawn. That same night, the IAF carried out additional strikes on multiple targets across Syria including at nearby Syrian military industry sites. The IDF assessed that it took several days for the Syrian army and Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) to realize the magnitude of the attack on this strategic site, codenamed 'Deep Layer' by the IDF. Its construction began in 2017 as a safer alternative to similar above-ground industrial sites targeted by the IDF over the past decade. The fall of the Assad regime in the last month likely contributed to the IDF's decision to declassify and share the operation's details. IDF intelligence's critical realization The mission was meticulously planned over a year of war in which Shaldag commandos executed over 800 operations in Gaza and Lebanon, even during the war's first month, suffering the loss of 13 operatives and officers. Preparations and modeling were accelerated in the three months preceding September after senior military and political officials were convinced of the mission's importance, despite the risks involved — such as helicopters flying at dangerously low altitudes over Lebanon and Syria — sometimes as low as 60 feet — carrying over 100 Israeli soldiers. In recent years, the IDF Intelligence Directorate monitored Iran’s construction of the 'Deep Layer' facility. Last year, as attacks on Hezbollah intensified, the unit concluded that the facility would be central to restoring Hezbollah's firepower capabilities post-war. Left operational, it could have enabled Hezbollah to produce advanced precision missiles with ranges of 40 to 300 kilometers (25 to 186 miles), capable of accurately targeting central Israel in significant numbers. The intelligence team accurately predicted the facility's layout, which included 16 production rooms, laboratories, an assembly hall, offices and storage units. Constructed in a horseshoe shape, with raw materials entering from one side and completed missiles exiting the other, it maximized security and efficiency. Eight fuel mixers for rocket engines have already been installed in the production halls, but the plant has yet to be declared operational. Consequently, security was relatively low, with only dozens of guards stationed at various posts. At night, when the underground facility was empty, the entrances were locked. Only a simple rope marked the entrance at the compound's shabby gate, still under construction. This weapons factory was unique in Syria, as it was built underground, shielded by natural concrete and layers of 60 meters to 120 meters (197 feet to 394 feet) of rocky soil. Excavation work was completed in 2021 under the close supervision of Israeli military intelligence. The IAF waited weeks for favorable weather conditions to carry out the operation, as even a minute of low cloud cover could jeopardize the mission. The Masyaf area is one of the most heavily fortified in Syria after Damascus, protected by advanced Russian-made SA-22 air defense systems and other anti-aircraft measures, including shoulder-launched missiles. Helicopters nearly touched water The helicopters flew extremely low, along carefully chosen routes, with diversions and close escort by two Apache attack helicopters, allowing them to evade the Syrian radar systems deployed in the area to protect the site. 'The entire Air Force was on high alert that night, but it wasn't enough — intelligence personnel and the Navy provided operational support, fire cover and the most precise intelligence possible for every phase of the mission,' according to the IDF. The IAF skillfully coordinated the operation with the Russians, who are stationed at their major base in Syria and with their nearby S-400 missile batteries, ensuring there were no misunderstandings or early detection that could disrupt the mission. The helicopters carrying the troops flew very low over the Mediterranean Sea, almost skimming the water, and maintained this altitude over enemy territory en route to the target. 'We practiced numerous scenarios and responses, dealt with the topography and used the area's valleys to our advantage, despite the risks of flying through them,' the military described. 'We knew a full Syrian division might respond, so speed was essential. The most critical aspect was breaching the facility's locked doors quickly. The IDF Chief of Staff constantly stressed reducing the operation’s duration,' according to the IDF. The operation was directed on the ground by Lt. Col. B. and the highest-ranking officer to set foot in Syria that night —Col. G., commander of the IAF’s 7th Squadron. The Israeli Air Force allocated four control rooms to manage the operation and synchronize all its components. 'Scenarios like a drone failing to secure an infiltration route for a few minutes require immediate backup,' the IDF noted. 'Every extreme scenario was rehearsed in advance.'Shaldag operatives landed at two preplanned temporary landing zones, 700 meters and 1.5 kilometers (0.4 miles and 0.9 miles) from the target. Just minutes before their landing, they saw explosions resulting from fighter jet strikes that isolated the compound and eliminated dozens of its guards. Inside the facility, they found weapons-casting machinery, rocket fuel imported from Iran, Iranian avionics equipment and materials that reinforced assessments that the plant was on the verge of becoming operational. According to the IDF, a former officer who headed a Military Intelligence unit had advocated to take action against the facility for years. In the years leading up to the operation, the target became a high priority for decision makers. 'We avoided opening a front against Assad for strategic reasons for a long time,' the IDF said. 'But it was clear this was part of Iran's vision — encircling Israel with a ring of fire supported by advanced manufacturing capabilities in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria.' Initially, the mission seemed impossible: flying into a missile-laden, heavily fortified area, landing troops and safely extracting them. 'The critical phase was the extraction,' the IDF noted. In preparation, daily intelligence reviews were conducted on the site and its surroundings for months before the operation. When the ground shook In the nearby town of Masyaf, residents remained unaware, assuming the events were routine Israeli airstrikes elsewhere, as the IDF had conducted during the war. Four attack helicopters deployed no fewer than 100 Shaldag soldiers on the ground, equipped with heavy gear, explosives and a utility ATV left behind to facilitate the force's extraction at the mission's end. Additionally, 20 operatives from 669th Unit were deployed near the target, accompanied by an intensive care team and a mobile field operating room. This ensured immediate treatment for severe injuries without the need to evacuate troops to Israel mid-operation. The rescue unit's medics were prepared to stabilize the wounded on-site, enabling the mission to continue without jeopardizing its success. Within 90 minutes of covert, low-altitude flight, 100 Shaldag soldiers, most of them reservists, landed at the two sites. The first group swiftly breached the compound, clearing the remaining Syrian soldiers and breaking through the armored doors to the underground facility, while the second group simultaneously deployed explosives inside the factory. The first team sprinted 700 meters from the landing zone to the locked gates leading into the underground compound. 'Fifty minutes after landing, the forces were already inside,' the IDF described. 'The troops used Syrian forklifts found inside to expedite the placement of explosives. This was pre-planned and practiced back in Israel, knowing those forklifts were there,' the statement added. IDF combat engineers had meticulously prepared a special demolition plan to ensure the site's complete destruction: a quarter-ton of Israeli explosives was strategically placed, augmented by roughly 700 tons of local rocket fuel that completed the task. As the demolition expert, S., activated the trigger, the troops took cover and say they could swear that 'the ground beneath them trembled at that moment.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The operation involved 120 commandos, six helicopters, 14 transport planes, 21 fighter jets and five UAVs. In total, 49 munitions were fired, with 70 aircraft in the air for over three hours, supported by thousands of officers and soldiers on the ground in Israel. Upon the mission’s completion, IAF Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar said: 'Amid this justified war, this was a crucial event for the nation's security. As we return safely, we can take pride and tell future generations about the significant step we took for Israel's security.' 'The Shaldag Unit’s operation deep inside Syrian territory joins a series of courageous missions the IDF has conducted over the past few months in Gaza, the Dahieh in Beirut and Iran, with the goal of destroying the Iranian Axis’ missile manufacturing capabilities,' IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said. 'For years, Iran formed a ring of rocket and missile fire around Israel’s borders, and we have struck both the ring and its head.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1unwse8yg	2025-01-02T11:55:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/02/ryUfTi7EIke/ryUfTi7EIke_0_0_1600_901_0_small.jpg

Israeli delegation to leave for Doha to continue hostage deal neg...	Israeli officials express careful optimism following Netanyahu's approval to send the team to Qatar; Arab media reports Hamas willing to complete 'one-phase' deal Israel is set to send a delegation to Doha, Qatar, on Friday to continue negotiations on a hostage deal with Hamas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement Thursday evening that he approved dispatching 'a professional delegation from the Mossad, Shin Bet and the IDF to continue the negotiations.' Earlier, Israel's envoy for hostages and missing citizens Gal Hirsch told the hostages’ families in a meeting that reports of an alleged 'deadlock' in the talks were inaccurate and that negotiations were ongoing under strict confidentiality and extensive efforts. Hirsch, who left the room during the conversation to take an urgent call regarding the negotiations, stressed that the current agreement being worked on aims to bring all the hostages home, despite Israel's refusal to meet Hamas' demand to end the war in Gaza. Senior Israeli officials reported slow progress in the talks but clarified that 'there's no breakthrough yet and gaps still remain.' They noted that mediators are increasing pressure on both sides and are pushing for an Israeli delegation to attend talks in Doha or Cairo. However, Hamas continued to refuse to provide lists with the names of the living hostages. Earlier on Thursday, Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported that a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo on Wednesday, met with senior Egyptian intelligence official Major General Ahmed Abdel Khalek and discussed the negotiations for the hostages' release and 'the new conditions set by the Israeli government.' According to the report, these conditions allegedly include replacing the names of 12 elderly, ill civilian hostages with those of 12 soldiers. Israel consistently claimed that Arab media reports regarding the negotiations are distorted. The Qatari newspaper further reported that the Hamas delegation's meeting with Egyptian officials included discussions on deferring contentious points to a later stage after the first phase of the agreement. The proposal will reportedly be presented to the Israeli side in an attempt to reach a resolution before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20. Egyptian sources told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that Hamas is open to a 'one-phase' agreement for all hostages on the condition that Israel withdraws from Gaza and ends the war within an agreed timeframe. According to these sources, Egyptian mediators aim to implement the first phase of the agreement, believing that 'the opening move' is the most challenging, after which remaining obstacles can be addressed and the war could conclude. The outlet also noted that a Hamas delegation traveled to Doha on Thursday to discuss recent developments in the negotiations. Hamas politburo deputy head Moussa Abu Marzouk told the newspaper that 'there’s a significant opportunity for the negotiations to succeed this time.' 'The delegation's visit aims to overcome obstacles and conditions recently set by the Israeli side to continue its aggression in Gaza,' Hamas spokesperson Jihad Taha added. 'Hamas approaches all matters positively and openly, prioritizing the needs of the Palestinian people and will spare no effort to halt the aggression in the Strip. We hope for an agreement but Israel refuses to compromise on its recently imposed conditions.' The remaining gaps in the negotiations mainly concern the number of hostages to be released. Hamas is willing to release a double-digit number of live hostages, while Israel is pushing to increase the figure. The terror organization is receptive to closing the gap by returning hostages already declared dead in the first phase. Sources familiar with the details estimated that if a deal is reached, fallen Israeli soldiers and murdered civilians also will be returned early in the process. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Territorial disagreements concerning the IDF's positioning along the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors also were discussed. Hamas demanded a more significant Israeli withdrawal in the initial phase, while Israel is only willing to consider withdrawal in subsequent negotiation stages. Further disagreements revolve around Hamas' hopes to end the war versus Netanyahu's conflicting statements. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1n5c8vljx	2025-01-02T10:34:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/BJHn7VJ8Jx/BJHn7VJ8Jx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Despite cease-fire, IDF destroys Hezbollah rocket launchers in so...	IDF said the attack on the medium-range rocket launchers was carried out by the Israeli Air Force under the direction of the Intelligence Directorate only after the Lebanese Army did not respond to a request to neutralize the weapons Israeli Air Force fighter jets destroyed Hezbollah medium-range rocket launchers in Lebanese territory Thursday evening, with the direction of the Intelligence Directorate. Arab media outlets reported three attacks in the Jbaa area and Jabal ar-Rihan in southern Lebanon. Watch the footage: There have been reports coming out of Lebanon in recent days of IDF attacks that are being carried out intermittently in the south of the country, but the footage from Thursday evening seems unusual compared to those attacks in recent weeks. An IDF spokesman said in a statement that 'The Israeli Air Force, with the direction of the Intelligence Directorate, struck Hezbollah medium-range rocket launchers at a military site belonging to the terrorist organization. Hezbollah rocket launchers adjacent to an additional military site in the area of Nabatieh were also struck..' The IDF Spokesperson's Office also stated: 'As part of the enforcement of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon, prior to the strike a request was sent to the Lebanese Armed Forces to neutralize the launchers that posed a threat to Israeli civilians and IDF troops. The launchers were struck only after the request was not addressed by the Lebanese Armed Forces. The IDF continues to act to remove any threat to the State of Israel in accordance with the ceasefire understandings.' Even after the cease-fire began in late November, the IDF continued its ground operations to remove terrorist infrastructure from villages in southern Lebanon. On Saturday, the IDF announced that the 300th Brigade Combat Team, under the command of the 146th Division, together with engineering forces, destroyed a 100-meter-long underground tunnel leading to a Radwan force position. 'With the assistance of the Yahalom Unit, who investigated and cleared the tunnel route of explosives and threats, the troops located rifles, machine guns, anti-tank missiles, and observation systems inside the tunnel. All the equipment was confiscated and destroyed, as well as the underground tunnel route itself. An anti-tank missile stockpile and heavy machine gun positions aimed at IDF posts were also found in the vicinity of the tunnel,' according to the IDF.

Hezbollah launches 'reconstruction campaign' with Iranian backing	Terror group announces start of official efforts to fix war damages of in southern Lebanon while thanking Tehran for its extensive funding of the project; Iraq and Yemen also provided support; Among the benefits: $400 for each displaced family, $8,000 for furniture, and an annual allowance for rent On December 5, Hezbollah's Secretary-General Naim Qassem delivered a relatively brief televised speech lasting about half an hour that was meant to give hope to the average Lebanese citizen suffering from the lastest war with Israel. Behind him, on a blue backdrop, was a portrait of the terror group’s former leader Hassan Nasrallah, accompanied by the slogan 'Promise and Commitment - The Reconstruction Campaign,' a campaign aimed at assisting Lebanese residents whose homes were destroyed by Israeli airstrikes. During the speech, which followed the implementation of the cease-fire on the Lebanon border, Qassem expressed gratitude to those who hosted displaced Lebanese individuals during the conflict and to various parties that supported the government and citizens. 'We thank Iran, under [Ali] Khamenei's leadership, its government, its people and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) for providing this generous aid,' he said. He announced Hezbollah's decision to grant displaced families financial aid ranging between $300 and $400 and elaborated on the reconstruction campaign. 'If a home was completely destroyed and served as the primary residence, the owner will receive $8,000 for furnishing a new home and $6,000 for one year's rent if they reside in Beirut or the Dahieh district. Outside Beirut, the rental aid amounts to $4,000 annually.' Qassem thanked Tehran, 'as most of this funding was provided by them,' as well as support from Iraq and Yemen. He called on 'Arab brothers and friendly countries to assist in the reconstruction.' According to a Lebanese report, however, only Iran appeared to have answered his call. Lebanese outlet Al-Diyar reported on Wednesday that Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati informed the U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Dorothy Shea that Iran was the only country offering reconstruction aid. According to the report, he advised the ambassador not to obstruct the process, asserting that the funds would reach Hezbollah via other channels if they weren't processed by the state. Shea reportedly promised to present the matter to American officials. In recent months, numerous reports have surfaced about aid shipments arriving in Lebanon from various countries, though these don’t appear to involve reconstruction efforts. It seems that Iran, despite its own need for donations, is the primary donor to the reconstruction efforts which Hezbollah officials claim are progressing. Diplomats commented on the reconstruction issue, telling Lebanon's Al-Jadeed outlet that Arab countries including Saudi Arabia have expressed interest in aiding reconstruction efforts but won’t transfer funds without oversight or control. Hezbollah's Deputy Executive Council Chair Ali Daamoush addressed the stages of the reconstruction campaign this week, saying: 'The secretary-general established a committee tasked with supervising the reconstruction.' 'Technical teams are conducting surveys in affected areas, prioritizing families whose homes were completely or partially destroyed and allowing them to return as quickly as possible,' he added. 'To our people along the border, we say: We will rebuild the villages. Aid will promptly reach everyone in need.' 'I assure the people that the funds for the reconstruction are secured,' he promised. 'Misleading campaigns will not shake public trust in the resistance — the funding is guaranteed by the Iranian people, who extended a helping hand to the Lebanese people. Thanks to Khamenei for his love and affection for Lebanon. Thanks to Iran, its citizens and its leadership, as well as to Iraq's leadership and people and to all nations willing to assist in reconstruction.' 'The project has begun and we will complete it. We’ll return to our homes with our heads held high. We’re demonstrating the victory of reconstruction over destruction and the triumph of resistance over aggression. Those who doubted Hezbollah's ability to compensate the victims were mistaken,' he concluded. Hezbollah's Deputy Political Council Chair Mahmoud Komati also addressed the reconstruction campaign this week, stressing the terror organization's dedication to it. 'There are red lines we won’t allow to be crossed, including the resistance's weapons, finances, reconstruction and shelter,' he said. 'We don't want the help of anyone offering aid to Lebanon with conditions that affect the resistance. The residents of southern Lebanon will return to their homes and no one will stop them. We pledged patience for 60 days. The 61st day will be different,' he warned. 'The situation will change, existing forces will be treated as occupiers and we will address them accordingly.' Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese outlet Al-Manar has been covering the reconstruction campaign extensively, documenting the distribution of funds and providing updates on its progress. Over the weekend, the channel's website reported that Hezbollah's real estate organization, Jihad al-Binaa ('Jihad of Construction'), identified 185,000 damaged housing units. 'The Jihad al-Binaa Development Fund, in line with Hezbollah and Nasrallah's promise, continued its efforts to identify structures damaged by Israeli aggression through its teams, swiftly working to restore residents to their homes,' the report read. An accompanying graphic shared on the channel's X account detailed the affected buildings' locations.

The report mentioned the reopening of Hezbollah's bank, Al-Qard al-Hassan, while a Hezbollah source clarified that reconstruction and housing subsidies would not come from the bank's funds, but from Iranian money recently delivered to Hezbollah. According to the source, Iran transferred $1 billion to Hezbollah via a regional state on the first day of the cease-fire with Israel, which then began assessing damages in preparation for compensation payments. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sku7aqeuye	2025-01-02T08:13:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/02/BJfMFXE8ye/BJfMFXE8ye_0_0_649_366_0_small.jpg

Finland power grid operator asks court to seize tanker over cable...	Finland's national power grid operator said on Thursday it had asked a Helsinki court to seize the Eagle S oil tanker in a bid to secure the company's claim for damages related to the breakdown of the undersea Estlink 2 electricity interconnector. The cable between Finland and Estonia was damaged on Dec. 25 along with four telecoms lines, and Finnish authorities the next day boarded the tanker, which carries Russian oil, on suspicion that it caused the damage by dragging its anchor along the seabed. Baltic Sea nations are on high alert after a string of outages of power cables, telecom links and gas pipelines since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. NATO said last week it would boost its presence in the region. Fingrid said in a statement on Thursday it had asked the Helsinki District Court to formally seize the Eagle S to help secure its financial claim. Finland's customs service has said it believes the Eagle S is part of a shadow fleet of tankers used to circumvent sanctions on Russian oil, and has formally impounded its cargo although the cargo is still on board the ship.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjnlhr4lke	2025-01-02T07:57:54-08:00	
Italy summons Iranian ambassador, demands release of journalist	Italy's foreign ministry summoned the Iranian ambassador on Thursday to demand the immediate release of reporter Cecilia Sala, who was seized in Tehran on Dec. 19 while working under a regular journalistic visa. The ministry said in a statement it had relayed 'serious concern' over Sala's detention and stressed the need for humane treatment and respect for her human rights. The Iranian embassy in Rome later said Sala was being given all the humanitarian care necessary and, for the first time, linked her case to that of an Iranian national, who was arrested last month in Milan at the request of the United States. Italian media have reported that Sala is in solitary confinement in a freezing cold cell with a neon light left on night and day.

Netanyahu released from hospital, but corruption trial testimony ...	Four days after successful prostate surgery, the prime minister was released from Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital; Doctors recommend two-week rest, which may lead to changes in the testimony schedule in the corruption trial against him; 'He still has a recovery period ahead of him' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was released from Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital late Thursday afternoon after undergoing successful prostate surgery on Sunday, and has remained hospitalized since then - although he left the hospital on Wednesday to cast a vote in the Knesset. The hospital said in a statement that 'the prime minister's doctors reported upon his discharge that his condition is stable and he is recovering satisfactorily from the surgery. He still has a recovery period ahead of him. Medical monitoring as necessary after such surgery will continue as usual. Upon his release, the prime minister expressed his 'deep gratitude to the Hadassah specialists and the entire team, to specialists from Assaf Harofeh hospital, and his personal physician, Dr. Zvika Berkowitz, who cared for him with dedication.' Doctors have recommended that Netanyahu spend two weeks recovering and resting at home following the surgery. Therefore, those close to Netanyahu estimate that his defense attorney, Amit Haddad, will file a request with the court to cancel all or part of next week's hearings. Netanyahu and Haddad have not yet made a final decision on the matter. On Tuesday, when the prime minister realized that the coalition did not have a majority to pass the trapped profits law, which is critical to approving the budget, Netanyahu decided to leave the hospital while he was recovering from surgery and vote in favor. In the end, the law was approved by a narrow margin, with, among others, Itamar Ben-Gvir's Otzma Yehudit faction voting against and members of Agudath Israel not participating. The doctors at Hadassah strongly opposed Netanyahu leaving the hospital for the vote, and a doctor at Hadassah told Ynet: 'It's not healthy for him.' His personal physician was present at the plenary session.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1d4mnelje	2025-01-02T06:52:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/B1mq11ObLJl/B1mq11ObLJl_0_75_1280_720_0_small.jpg
Musk planning to host German far-right leader for online chat	Elon Musk looks likely to host the leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party ahead of Germany's Feb. 23 national election in a live interview on X, his social media platform. In December, the Tesla mogul endorsed the AfD, an anti-immigration, anti-Islamic party labelled as right-wing-extremist by German security services, causing consternation in Berlin, where all other parties have ruled out working with a party they regard as dangerous and undemocratic. A spokesperson for the AfD said on Thursday that party leader Alice Weidel was in touch with Musk's office, but said he could give no further details at present.

How are these Israeli organizations helping drive change for olim...	Eilon Gilad: Making Aliyah is 'essential' for securing Israel's future Making aliyah is a life-changing decision, but according to Eilon Gilad, CEO of Belong, it’s also essential for securing Israel’s future. To support new olim, Belong works to remove as many obstacles as possible and ensure they feel embraced. 'We're here to support them with any aspect of their life, whether it's housing, employment, or learning Hebrew,' Gilad told ILTV during its Lights of Hope event. Gilad explained that his organization helps bridge the gap between a new immigrant’s culture and Israeli culture. For example, if someone is looking for housing, Belong will connect them with an Anglo-centric agent to assist. If they’re searching for a job, Belong helps them identify their strengths, refine how they present themselves, and showcase the value they bring as new immigrants. These are just a few of the ways Belong supports olim. Gilad participated in a panel at the event called 'The Light of Community,' which highlighted organizations helping individuals navigate significant life changes. Another organization featured was Nechama and Hatzala, which focuses on supporting Israeli soldiers. For over 15 months, Israel has been at war, and soldiers are struggling in numerous ways. Nechama and Hatzala has stepped up to meet their needs. Nechama and Hatzala is dedicated to making a meaningful impact by providing essential resources and emotional support to those on the frontlines. Through their initiatives, they help soldiers face challenges while building connections that strengthen the broader community. Shmulik Moskowitz, board member and co-founder of Nechama and Hatzala, shared how his organization 'brought as much IDF gear as we could' to the country immediately after October 7 to help save lives. Since then, their mission has expanded to include small but meaningful gestures, like delivering ice cream or soup to soldiers on the frontlines. A warm bowl of soup on a cold day can 'warm the hearts' of IDF soldiers, Moskowitz said. 'It is also a symbol of our support.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjijjxn8yx	2025-01-02T05:19:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/02/HJe8gQNLJl/HJe8gQNLJl_218_0_658_371_0_small.jpg

What Is judo star Peter Paltchik’s real dream?	Peter Paltchik: 'I have a dream that Olympic athletes will not struggle any more' Israeli Olympic medalist Peter Paltchik has one clear dream: that Olympic athletes no longer have to struggle financially. Judo star Paltchik immigrated to Israel with his mother as a baby. At just 23 years old, his mother worked tirelessly to make ends meet, eventually traveling to the U.S. to earn a living. During her absence, Paltchik was raised by his grandparents. It was his grandfather who introduced him to judo. However, Paltchik recalls the early days of his career being incredibly challenging due to the financial strain of pursuing sports full-time. 'It does not matter if you come from a rich family or from a poor family,' Paltchik said. 'At the end of the day, the individual Olympic athlete is poor because he needs to finance himself, he needs to support himself financially. It's flights to training camps, even to some championships, and it's full time – food, psychologists, everything in the first year is the toughest.' To address these challenges, Paltchik recently launched a foundation aimed at supporting athletes across multiple Olympic sports. He described the initiative as the 'light of my life,' adding that he feels like he is 'all of a sudden, able to give back.' The foundation raises funds to provide sports scholarships, helping young athletes achieve their dreams without the financial burdens he faced. 'I have a dream that Olympic athletes will not struggle any more,' Paltchik said. Paltchik was interviewed by ILTV as part of its Lights of Hope event.

What role does higher education have in driving the AI revolution...	Prof. Ami Moyal: Artificial intelligence is set to revolutionize teaching and learning in higher education, according to Prof. Ami Moyal of Afeka Academic College of Engineering in Tel Aviv. Moyal highlighted four key roles that higher education institutions can play in this transformation: 1. Training Engineers, Computer Scientists, and Data Scientists Universities must provide education at all levels—bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees—while focusing on research and technology transfer to the industry to develop advanced products. 2. Training Skilled STEM Teachers Higher education must prepare educators who can implement the necessary changes in the classical education system. 3. Providing Lifelong Learning Opportunities 'When engineers enter the industry, they need updates with regards to their skills or areas of knowledge,' Moyal said. 'Academia can play a major role here.' 4. Strengthening Connections with the Education System This includes collaborative courses and partnerships between high school teachers and college professors. Speaking at the Lights of Hope event alongside David Perlmutter, Chairman of the Israeli High-Tech Human Capital Committee, Moyal emphasized the importance of the high-tech sector as Israel’s primary economic growth engine. He stressed that its role in post-war recovery will be critical, ensuring Israel has the human capital needed to sustain growth. This preparation, he said, begins with education—specifically the national STEM education continuum, which feeds the technology workforce both in quality and quantity.

High Court curtails Ben-Gvir’s police oversight powers	Justices uphold law expanding national security minister’s authority over police but issue restrictive interpretation, effectively hollowing it out; 'Once again, the court positions itself as the sovereign, trampling on the will of the voter,' Ben-Gvir protests The High Court of Justice unanimously upheld on Thursday a law that expands National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir’s authority over police operations but struck down, in a narrow 5-4 decision, a key provision allowing him to delineate general policy on police investigations, ruling it unconstitutional. The majority of justices ruled the clause posed a significant risk to suspects’ rights and failed to meet the legal standards for restricting fundamental rights. A minority dissented, arguing the clause did not violate constitutional principles. The broader legislation, which places police under the government’s authority and requires the police commissioner to follow the minister’s policy guidelines, was upheld. However, the court imposed strict limits, clarifying that the law permits only general policy directives and prohibits any operational interference by the minister. The court emphasized that its interpretation ensures no shift in the balance of power between the government and the police, effectively maintaining the status quo before the law’s enactment. Critics have argued that the law, a cornerstone of the coalition agreements forming the current government, undermines police autonomy and risks politicization. The court’s decision represents a compromise, preserving most of the law while addressing concerns over excessive government control in police investigations. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ben-Gvir sharply criticized the ruling, accusing the court of overstepping its authority. 'Once again, the court positions itself as the sovereign, trampling on the will of the voter. This grave decision to neuter the Police Ordinance is designed to strip the minister of his authority and give control of the police to the attorney general and state prosecutor. In a democratic state, the minister in charge sets policy for the police, but the court obviously doesn’t care about that,' he said. Justice Minister Yariv Levin also condemned the ruling, describing it as undemocratic. 'In what other country can judges, who appoint themselves, strike down a law passed by parliament in three readings by a single-vote margin? Only in Israel is democracy being replaced by the rule of a handful of judges,' he said, calling for urgent judicial reforms. The law has faced legal challenges since its passage. A coalition of organizations and Knesset members petitioned the court in January 2023. The petitioners, backed by Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, warned that the law effectively turned Ben-Gvir into a 'super commissioner,' allowing undue political interference in police decision-making. They warned that a politically controlled police force is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes. In June 2023, the court issued a conditional order requiring the government to justify the amendments. Baharav-Miara said in January 2024 that Ben-Gvir had overstepped his authority, including directing police actions during public protests. The court later issued an interim injunction barring him from giving operational directives to the police, particularly regarding protest management. Despite these rulings, petitioners alleged that Ben-Gvir continued to interfere in police operations, including efforts to suppress anti-war protests. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkspt1e8kx	2025-01-02T02:24:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/04/03/BkEc00jBdWn/BkEc00jBdWn_312_203_1009_569_0_small.jpg

IDF releases official casualty numbers from war: 891 fatalities, ...	Military reports most fatalities in single conflict since Yom Kippur War and expresses concerns with upward trend in suicides, recruiting hundreds of mental health professionals to address crisis The IDF announced Thursday that 891 soldiers have been killed since the Hamas-led assault on October 7, 2023, marking one of the deadliest conflicts in Israel’s history. The toll includes deaths from combat, accidents and suspected suicides and is the largest since the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Of the 891 fatalities, 528 occurred in 2023, with 512 attributed to operational activity. Most deaths happened around October 7, when 329 soldiers were killed, including local rapid-response teams. Another 226 deaths were recorded in 2024. Suicide cases have also surged, with 17 suspected cases in 2023—seven conscripts, four career soldiers and six reservists—compared to 14 in 2022. In 2024, suicides increased to 21 cases, including seven conscripts, two career soldiers and 12 reservists, all men. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Accidental deaths also rose during the war. Nine soldiers died in traffic accidents in 2023, including five on duty and four in civilian incidents. By 2024, 20 more soldiers were killed in traffic accidents, 17 in civilian settings. Operational accidents claimed 65 lives, 60 in Gaza and five in Lebanon, involving incidents such as friendly fire and weapon mishandling. To address the mental health crisis, the IDF has recruited 800 mental health officers, established a new mental health center with clinics nationwide, and expanded psychological support for soldiers, especially combat units. However, challenges remain, particularly in assessing the mental and physical readiness of older reservists, many aged 40-60, returning after years away from service. 'The strain of war has created unprecedented burdens on soldiers, levels we haven’t seen in decades,' an IDF official said, adding that the military expects a long-term rise in mental health challenges as the war ends and combatants transition back to civilian life. The war's toll far surpasses the decade before it, which saw 152 fatalities, including those during the 2014 Gaza war. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk6zi1e8ke	2025-01-02T01:24:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/05/16/B1ELBq00Xm0/B1ELBq00Xm0_0_133_1280_721_0_small.jpg
As world focus shifts to Gaza, what is happening in Ukraine?	Ukraine’s chief rabbi describes Jewish resilience amid Russian attacks, with many displaced or making Aliyah to Israel; community continues to aid those remaining, providing food, medicine and Hanukkah events for children, elderly and soldiers With global attention focused on the war in Gaza, Ukraine continues to endure relentless Russian attacks, including missile strikes and drone assaults targeting critical infrastructure. 'Just a few minutes ago, Just now a few minutes ago there were a few explosions in Kyiv—ballistic rockets and other missiles,' Ukraine's Chief Rabbi Moshe Reuven Azman told Ynet in an interview. He described how daily strikes by Iranian drones have further exacerbated issues with electricity and heating, creating dire conditions as winter sets in. Despite the war, Ukraine’s Jewish community marked Hanukkah with events for children, the elderly and wounded soldiers. 'We continue our obligation to bring light to the people during the war and bring help—humanitarian, spiritual and other kinds to the people in depression and darkness,' Azman said. According to Azman, many members of the Jewish community remain displaced, with some having made Aliyah to Israel, others relocating to Europe, and a few returning to Ukraine, often at great personal risk. 'They risk their lives but prefer to be in their own homes. Most old people live in their apartments even if they hear explosions. That's why we bring them food and medicine,' he added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: When asked whether he feels like the global focus has shifted away from the fighting in Ukraine to the Middle East, Azman highlights a shared threat between Israel and Ukraine, identifying Russia, Iran and North Korea as common adversaries. 'It’s the same enemy, the same evil,' he said, pointing to Iran’s provision of weapons to Hamas and Hezbollah, and Russia’s destructive role in Ukraine. 'I was in the U.S. a few weeks ago and I tried to explain to the administration about the evil of Russia. With this war, they would like to destroy not only Ukraine but help enemies of Israel too.' Azman noted that he saw strong U.S. support for Israel in Washington under the incoming Trump administration but highlighted mixed attitudes toward Ukraine. 'Some of them have problems with this and don't understand the real situation. Some understand but say they have problems and would like not to involve the U.S. in inside problems. I explained that it's not just Ukraine's problem, it's an American interest to support Ukraine because it's the same evil that is against Israel,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjywcimiye	2025-01-02T01:01:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/09/15/BkZQyNDW1T/BkZQyNDW1T_0_48_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
