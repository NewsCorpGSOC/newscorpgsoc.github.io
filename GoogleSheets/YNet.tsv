Military spokesperson dismisses Hamas claims children killed in Israeli airstrike, says captors mutilated bodies to cover up the crime and demands return of their mother Shiri Bibas The captors of Ariel and Kfir Bibas, the two Israeli children taken hostage by Hamas during the October 7 terrorist attack, 'brutally murdered them with their bare hands,' not by gunfire, IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Friday. In a televised statement, Hagari dismissed Hamas' claims that the Bibas children and their mother, Shiri, were killed in an Israeli airstrike. He reiterated that intelligence and forensic evidence confirm the children were not executed by gunfire but were killed in a particularly violent manner by their captors, who then mutilated their bodies to cover up the crime.

Niva Wankrat has kept a suitcase ready in her living room for her son Omer since he was abducted on October 7 from the Nova festival, regularly updating it with clothes and essentials for him Niva Wankrat, the mother of hostage Omer Wankrat, who is expected to return Saturday as part of the planned releases, can no longer wait. In a special video shared by the family, she goes through the suitcase she prepared for her son, who will return to Israel after 505 days in captivity. Along with Omer’s close friend, Adi Taub, they go over the clothes packed for him and the items they bought, including a new phone to replace the one that was found shattered at the site of the Nova music festival, from which he was abducted on October 7. The family also packed perfume and an electric razor in the suitcase, which, according to his mother, has been waiting in the living room for 503 days. In the video, Adi films everything so she can show it to Omer when he returns. 'I've been waiting for this day since the moment we realized Omer had been kidnapped,' Niva shared. 'The suitcase has been sitting in our living room for 503 days.' Throughout the months, she replaced the new clothes in the suitcase according to the changing seasons. '503 times, we took out and put in items that Omer loves so much. Summer clothes were swapped for winter ones. On Saturday, when my Omer returns, our new mission as a family will be to help him get back to normal life, alongside the crucial mission of bringing all the remaining hostages home.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Along with Omer Wankrat, five other hostages—Tal Shoham, Omer Shem Tov, Avera Mengistu, Hisham al-Sayed, and Eliya Cohen—are also expected to be released tomorrow. Despite the fact that Shiri Bibas will not be returned along with the bodies of her children, Ariel and Kfir, Israel is not expected to jeopardize the release of the six living hostages. However, the defense establishment is reportedly considering recommending that the government issue an ultimatum to Hamas in the coming day. Earlier, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed retaliation in response to what he called Hamas’ 'cruel and malicious violation' of agreements. He stated that the terrorist group’s brutality 'knows no bounds' and promised: 'Hamas will pay the price.' Omer Wankrat arrived at the Nova festival just an hour before Hamas launched its attack. The last message he managed to send his family at 7:01 a.m. on October 7 was: 'I’m terrified.' Since then—504 days—he has been in Hamas captivity. Tomorrow, at long last, he is expected to be freed from his nightmare. Omer, 23, from Gedera, is the eldest of three children, the son of Shay and Niva. At age 14, he was diagnosed with colitis. Describing her son’s character, his mother said, 'He’s a wonderful brother. He has a very special bond with his siblings. He’s always smiling, loves people, very social—a magnet for others. His dream is to be a restaurant critic. He’s independent and hardworking—he started working to support himself at 17. He managed a chef’s restaurant and worked hard to get there.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sjwmcei5jl	2025-02-21T04:18:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/21/SJzRw8AHcyx/SJzRw8AHcyx_2_0_1279_720_0_small.jpg
US: Hamas 'going to face total annihilation'	Adam Boehler, President Donald Trump's envoy for hostage affairs, called terror group's failure to provide Shir Bibas' body 'horrific' and 'clear violation' of cease-fire While the Trump administration did not issue an official statement following the revelation that what was believed to be the body of Shiri Bibas was a Gazan woman, Adam Boehler, President Donald Trump's envoy for hostage affairs, called Hamas’s actions 'horrific' and a 'clear violation' of the cease-fire. 'If I were them, I’d release everybody or they are going to face total annihilation,' he warned in an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN. Boehler added that Israel had informed senior U.S. officials in advance that the remains were not those of Shiri and that forensic evidence confirmed her sons, Ariel and Kfir, were brutally murdered in November 2023 in captivity.

Condemnations for the murder of the children arrived from across the globe. Germany’s ambassador to Israel Steffen Seibert said: 'The unbearable has been confirmed: Ariel and Kfir Bibas, two small German citizens, were taken by ruthless terrorists and killed in captivity.' Kfir and Ariel's father, Yarden, is a German citizen. 'Let us remember them as they were—alive, young, radiant, and full of promise. What happened to Shiri? On top of everything else, Hamas are cruel liars,' he added British Ambassador to Israel Simon Walters said: 'The Israeli authorities have now confirmed from forensic evidence that the little Bibas children were murdered in captivity. This is a gruesome new low, compounded by the failure to return the body of Shiri, their mother. May Kfir and Ariel rest in peace.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1hrlju51e	2025-02-21T02:56:16-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/14/ryvRnm6Kkg/ryvRnm6Kkg_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Counterterrorism units tracked Uzbek national, gaining access to his email, where they found evidence of planned attacks on potential targets included synagogues and Jewish schools Turkish security forces have arrested an Uzbek national with ties to an Islamic State affiliate in Asia who was allegedly planning attacks on Jewish institutions in Turkey, authorities said on Friday. The suspect entered Turkey legally from a European country and was not previously known to local authorities, according to reports. Counterterrorism units tracked him and gained access to his email, where they found evidence of ongoing communication with a foreign national as the two planned the attacks. Security officials said the suspect was found hiding in an apartment in Istanbul, where he was taken into custody. Authorities did not specify when the attacks were planned to take place but said potential targets included synagogues and Jewish schools in Turkey and other unnamed countries. Following the arrest, Turkish police increased security around Jewish institutions and issued warnings to community leaders about a possible threat from ISIS.

Six hostages set for release Saturday as Israel weighs response t...	Security officials mulling retaliatory measures for terror group's failure to return the body of Shiri Bibas, mother of Kfir and Ariel - who the IDF says were brutally murdered while in captivity Despite Hamas failing to transfer the body of Israeli hostage Shiri Bibas, with the received remains later identified as a Gazan woman, Israel's priorities remain the same: Ensure that the first phase of the cease-fire deal proceeds as planned and as smoothly as possible. Six living hostages are scheduled to be released during Saturday's exchange. Families notified that their loved ones are set to return include the relatives of Tal Shoham, Omer Wankrat, Omer Shem Tov, Avera Mengistu, Hisham al-Sayed, and Eliya Cohen. In addition, four more hostage bodies are planned to be handed over next week - which will mark the end of the first phase of the agreement with Hamas. Once that phase is complete—assuming it proceeds smoothly—Israel is expected to hold a critical discussion on the second stage of the deal. Meanwhile, security officials are likely to recommend retaliatory measures in response to what they consider a serious violation of the agreement regarding Shiri Bibas. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: One option under consideration is advising the government to issue an ultimatum to Hamas within the next 24 hours regarding the return of Shiri Bibas, which could include halting some of the concessions Israel has made as part of the deal. Hamas claimed Friday morning that Bibas' remains appear to have been mixed with other human remains from the rubble after an Israeli air strike hit the place she was held in. The IDF stated that per intelligence, Ariel and Kfir were brutally murdered in captivity sometime around November 2023. Earlier Friday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed retribution over the perceived violation of the agreement. Hours after the bodies of Oded Lifshitz and the two Bibas children were identified, Netanyahu did not clarify what had happened to Shiri Bibas but confirmed that instead of her, the body of a Gazan woman was returned to Israel. 'The State of Israel bows its head in mourning for two small children, innocent babies, brothers—Ariel and Kfir Bibas, of blessed memory—and for Oded Lifshitz, of blessed memory, one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz. All three were brutally murdered in Hamas captivity in the early weeks of the war. The cruelty of the Hamas monsters knows no bounds,' Netanyahu said. He continued, 'Not only did they abduct the father, Yarden Bibas, the young mother, Shiri, and their two small babies. In an unimaginable act of cynicism, they did not return Shiri alongside her little angels. Instead, they placed the body of a Gazan woman in the casket.' Netanyahu vowed to 'act decisively' to bring Shiri home, 'along with all our hostages—both the living and the fallen.' He also issued a direct warning to Hamas, one day before the next hostage release, stating: 'We will ensure Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and wicked violation of the agreement.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1anr6h5jl	2025-02-21T01:37:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/Sy37JEf9kx/Sy37JEf9kx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Two of the four bodies handed over on Thursday were identified as infant Kfir Bibas and his four-year-old brother Ariel, while a third body that was supposed to be their mother, Shiri, was found not to match with any hostage and remained unidentified, the military said. 'The ICRC does not participate in sorting, screening, or examining the deceased - this is the responsibility of the parties to the conflict', it said in a statement on Friday, while expressing concern that the releases had not been conducted privately and in a dignified manner.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkivfch5kl	2025-02-21T01:15:47-08:00

U.S. and Russian participants have met in Switzerland for unofficial talks about the Ukraine war in recent months, including as recently as last week, three sources with knowledge of the matter said. While the attendees have diplomatic and security experience, they are not government officials and it was not immediately clear if any were sent by their governments, two of the sources said. The sources declined to identify the attendees. The sources described the talks as a side channel with some contacts occurring during the transition period following U.S. President Donald Trump's Nov. 5 election victory. At least a small number of advisers to Trump are aware of the encounters, said one of the sources, who had direct knowledge of the matter. Many other details remain unclear, including whether Ukrainians were present, when the encounters began and what the meetings' agendas covered.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkm7rthc1l	2025-02-21T00:58:10-08:00

Four explosive devices, each weighing about five kilograms and equipped with a timer, were placed on at transportation depots in the Tel Aviv area It was reported on Friday that the Shin Bet arrested three suspects for allegedly assisting in planting explosive devices on buses in the Tel Aviv area, in what authorities believe was a botched terror attack. It was also reported that some of the detainees identified as Jewish Israelis. While security forces continue investigating the suspected attack—in which bombs exploded on three buses at two Bat Yam depots—extensive searches were conducted Friday morning on public buses across major cities, with the IDF deployed three reinforcement battalions to the West Bank. Four explosive devices, each weighing about five kilograms and equipped with a timer, were placed on several buses. Three detonated Thursday night in Bat Yam, while a fourth was discovered and neutralized near Wolfson Hospital in Holon. No injuries were reported. One of the bombs bore the inscription 'Revenge from Tulkarm,' with Hamas’ terror branch in the West Bank city later hinting at its involvement. In response, the Transportation Ministry ordered overnight inspections of all bus depots, with security reinforcements extended to the Jerusalem light rail and increased police presence across public transportation hubs. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi directed forces to intensify operations along security zones based on intelligence findings. As part of these efforts, three additional IDF battalions from the Kfir, Nahal, and Commando brigades were deployed to the West Bank on Friday morning. Meanwhile, the IDF confirmed that the main phase of Operation Iron Wall, aimed at dismantling terrorist networks in northern West Bank refugee camps, has concluded. While forces completed sweeps in Jenin and other key locations, a permanent Kfir Brigade unit remains for ongoing raids, particularly in Tulkarm and Nur Shams. Following a late-night security briefing, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the suspected attack and vowed a forceful response against West Bank terror networks. Defense Minister Israel Katz ordered a ramping up of operations in West Bank refugee camps, stating: 'We will hunt down the terrorists relentlessly and dismantle the terror infrastructure that serves as an outpost for Iran’s axis of evil. Any residents who harbor terrorists will pay a heavy price.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkh500ascje	2025-02-21T00:46:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/21/rkGpY3rckl/rkGpY3rckl_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Lebanon's Hezbollah to bury Nasrallah in mass funeral	Terror group's leader was killed on September 27 in an Israeli airstrike as he met fellow commanders in Beirut, a stunning blow in early phase of offensive that left the Iranian proxy a shadow of its former self Lebanon's Hezbollah will bury its former leader Hassan Nasrallah on Sunday nearly five months after he was killed in an Israeli airstrike, in a mass funeral aimed at showing political strength after the group emerged badly weakened from last year's war. Nasrallah was killed on September 27 in an Israeli airstrike as he met commanders in a bunker in Beirut's southern suburbs, a stunning blow in the early phase of an Israeli offensive that has left the Iran-backed group a shadow of its former self. Revered by Hezbollah supporters, Nasrallah led the Shi'ite Muslim group through decades of conflict with Israel, overseeing its transformation into a military force with regional sway and becoming one of the most prominent Arab figures in generations. The funeral in Beirut's southern suburbs will also honor Hashem Safieddine, who led Hezbollah for one week after Nasrallah's death before he was also killed by Israel, underlining how deeply Israeli intelligence had penetrated the paramilitary group. He will be buried in the south on Monday. 'The funeral is a launchpad for the next phase. A great funeral that draws hundreds of thousands is a way of telling everyone that Hezbollah still exists, that it is still the main Shi'ite actor in Lebanon,' said Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center. Israel killed thousands of Hezbollah fighters and inflicted huge destruction in Beirut's southern suburbs and other areas of Lebanon where its supporters live. The impact on Hezbollah was compounded by the ousting of its ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria, severing the supply route to Iran. Its weakened stature has been reflected in Lebanon's post-war politics, with the group unable to impose its will in the formation of a new government and language legitimizing its arsenal omitted from the new cabinet's policy statement. Sheikh Sadeq al-Nabulsi, a cleric close to Hezbollah, said adversaries in Lebanon and abroad believed the group had been defeated, but the funeral would be a message that this was not the case. It would be a 'battle to prove Hezbollah's existence'. The ceremony will be held at Lebanon's biggest sports arena - Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium on the outskirts of the Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs. Nasrallah will then be buried at a dedicated site nearby. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi will attend, an Iranian official said. Several leaders of Iraqi Shi'ite militias are also expected to attend. Iraqi Airways has added flights to Beirut to cope with extra demand from Iraqis who want to travel to Beirut for the funeral, a spokesperson for the Iraqi transportation ministry said. Nasrallah's death was a huge blow to Iran, whose Revolutionary Guards established Hezbollah in 1982. Supporters remember him for standing up to Israel and defying the United States. To his foes, he was head of a terrorist organization and a proxy for Iran's Shi'ite Islamist theocracy in its tussle for influence in the Middle East. After he was killed, Nasrallah was buried temporarily next to his son, Hadi, who died fighting for Hezbollah in 1997. His official funeral was scheduled to allow time for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from south Lebanon under the terms of a U.S.-backed ceasefire which ended last year's war. Though Israel has largely withdrawn from the south, its troops continue to hold five hilltop positions in the area, which Hezbollah battled for years to liberate from Israeli forces before they withdrew in 2000. The conflict spiraled after Hezbollah opened fire in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas at the start of the Gaza war, on October 8, 2023. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkqzpnh9ke	2025-02-21T00:06:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/06/HkzHdEad11kg/HkzHdEad11kg_0_66_2200_1239_0_small.jpg

Al-Mujahedeen: The fringe terror group behind murder of Bibas chi...	Radical Salafi organization operated independently in Gaza for over two decades; faction falsely claims Bibas family was killed in Israeli airstrike, though intel confirms execution while in captivity The extremist Salafi organization Al-Mujahedeen ('Lords of the Wilderness') is the group that held Shiri Bibas and her two young children, Ariel and Kfir, after they were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Hamas-led October 7 attack. According to Israeli assessments, the group murdered them in captivity as early as November 2023. Al-Mujahedeen was founded at the start of the Second Intifada in 2001, breaking away from Fatah. It initially operated as a faction of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades before becoming an independent militant group. The organization follows a radical Salafi ideology, which seeks to return to what it considers the fundamental roots of Islam, advocating extreme measures to achieve its goals. The group was initially led by Omar Abu-Sharia, whom Israel attempted to eliminate in 2006. He succumbed to his injuries six months later. Over the years, Al-Mujahedeen has carried out numerous attacks and has positioned itself as a violent extremist faction within Gaza. Unlike Hamas, which governs the enclave, Al-Mujahedeen maintains a distinct identity, often aligning with global jihadist movements. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: During the ongoing war in Gaza, the organization claimed to have suffered significant losses, including key members of its leadership. In April 2023, it announced the deaths of several senior operatives, including the commander of its rocket unit in central Gaza, a senior figure in the Deir al-Balah battalion, and a member of its elite unit in the same area. After the October 7 attack, Hamas transferred some hostages to smaller armed factions, including Al-Mujahedeen. Shiri Bibas and her children were among those handed over. According to Israeli intelligence, they were held in Khan Younis before being murdered. The group falsely claimed that the Bibas family was killed in an Israeli airstrike, but IDF officials have confirmed that the children were brutally executed in captivity. Al-Mujahedeen's actions underscore the fragmentation of militant groups within Gaza and the brutality faced by hostages held by factions beyond Hamas itself. Israeli authorities continue to demand the return of Shiri Bibas' body, along with all remaining hostages. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hjtwd3hcjg	2025-02-20T23:36:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/18/Sk7kExKDkx/Sk7kExKDkx_0_76_1024_577_0_small.jpg
Israel braces for 'Coral' winter storm: Tempartures bellow freezi...	Snow expected in northern Israel, with the possibility of spreading to Jerusalem and Negev Highlands, but estimated to not be signifcant due to lack of rainfall Israel is bracing for the 'Coral' winter storm, set to bring with it a significant drop in temperatures and the possibility of snow in higher elevations. According to the Meteorological Service, local showers, mostly light, are expected on Friday from northern Israel to the northern Negev. Snow will fall on Mount Hermon, and light snowfall may occur in the highest peaks of northern Israel. Precipitation will be accompanied by unseasonally cold temperatures. On Saturday, intermittent rain is expected in northern and central Israel, with isolated thunderstorms possible, mainly in the north. Snow will continue on Mount Hermon, and light snowfall could occur in the highest peaks of the northern mountains. Strong winds are also expected, particularly in the south. At night, light snow may fall in the higher elevations of central Israel, including the Samaria and Judea regions, as well as the Negev Highlands, including Jerusalem. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sunday will be cloudy, with temperatures dropping even further. Light rain is expected, and there is a possibility of light snowfall in the mountains. The highest chance for snow in Jerusalem and the Negev Highlands will be late Sunday night into Monday morning. However, due to limited precipitation, only a thin accumulation is expected—perhaps 1 to 3 centimeters. Any snow that does settle is unlikely to cause road closures. Monday will remain particularly cold, with occasional light rain in some areas. Dr. Amir Givati, director of the Meteorological Service, stated, 'The cold wave is already on its way, and we will begin to feel the temperature drop on Saturday, with further declines on Sunday and Monday. This system is bringing heavy snowfall to neighboring Turkey and Greece, causing disruptions there. However, in Israel, it is primarily expected to bring extreme cold rather than significant snowfall. Any snow that does fall in the central mountains is unlikely to accumulate significantly.' From Saturday night into Sunday and throughout Sunday, the cold wave is expected to bring near-freezing temperatures in the mountains, with possible ice formation and frost, though no significant snowfall. According to the Meteorological Service forecast, temperatures on Sunday night into Monday are expected to drop sharply, reaching -8.2°C on Mount Hermon, -4.1°C in Merom Golan, -3.9°C in El Rom, -3.3°C on Mount Bental, -2.4°C in Kidah, and -2°C in Bar’am. Temperatures will be unseasonably cold across the country. In Jerusalem, temperatures will range from 5 to 10 degrees Celsius, while Tel Aviv will see a range of 11 to 16 degrees. Haifa will experience temperatures between 10 and 14 degrees, and Safed will drop to between 3 and 9 degrees. Katzrin will range from 5 to 12 degrees, and Tiberias from 13 to 17 degrees. In Nazareth, temperatures will be between 8 and 12 degrees, while Afula will range from 8 to 15 degrees. Beit She’an is expected to range from 9 to 17 degrees, Lod from 9 to 16, and Ashdod from 10 to 16. In Ein Gedi, temperatures will be between 12 and 18 degrees, while Beersheba will range from 7 to 13 degrees. Mitzpe Ramon will see temperatures between 5 and 13 degrees, and Eilat will be the warmest, ranging from 11 to 19 degrees. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk9zgnhcjl	2025-02-20T23:07:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/11/24/S1lv49XTLo/S1lv49XTLo_0_133_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Prime minister accuses terror group of transferring body of a Gazan woman; despite violation, Saturday exchange to take place as planned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday condemned Hamas for returning the body of an unidentified woman instead of that of Shiri Bibas, the mother of two young boys whose remains were identified late Thursday night. Hours after Israeli authorities confirmed the identities of Oded Lifshitz and brothers Kfir and Ariel Bibas, Netanyahu accused Hamas of transfering a Gazan woman’s body instead of Shiri’s. He did not comment on her fate. 'The State of Israel bows its head in mourning for two small children, innocent babies, brothers—Ariel and Kfir Bibas—and for Oded Lifshitz, one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz,' Netanyahu said. 'All three were brutally murdered in Hamas captivity during the first weeks of the war. The cruelty of Hamas monsters knows no bounds.

'Instead, they placed the body of a Gazan woman in the coffin,' he said. The prime minister pledged to work 'resolutely' to bring Shiri home, 'along with all our hostages—both the living and the fallen.' His remarks came a day before six Israeli hostages were expected to be released in a new round of negotiations. They include Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, along with four hostages classified as ill or wounded—Omer Wenkert, Elia Cohen, Tal Shahem, and Omer Shem Tov. Netanyahu warned that Israel would make Hamas 'pay the full price' for what he called a violation of the agreement. 'The sacred memory of Oded Lifshitz and of Ariel and Kfir Bibas will be forever enshrined in the heart of the nation,' he said. 'May God avenge their blood. And we will remember them.' The military confirmed that the identification of Kfir and Ariel Bibas was swift and conclusive. 'We can say with certainty that they were murdered in a brutal manner, a fact supported by intelligence,' the IDF said. Officials emphasized that Israel would make sure the world knows 'the baby and the child were murdered based on solid intelligence, not just forensic examination.

Trump, Putin meeting depends on progress toward ending Ukraine wa...	US top diplomat says he discussed such meeting with Russian counterpart Lavrov in Saudi Arabia, telling him: 'There isn't going to be a meeting until we know what the meeting is going to be about' A possible meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin 'will largely depend on whether we can make any progress on ending the war in Ukraine,' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday. Rubio said he discussed such a meeting when he met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, telling Lavrov and Russian officials: 'There isn't going to be a meeting until we know what the meeting is going to be about.' 'I think when that meeting happens will largely depend on whether we can make any progress on ending the war in Ukraine,' Rubio told journalist Catherine Herridge in an interview broadcast on X. Following the talks in Saudi Arabia, Trump - who spoke on the phone with Putin last week - said on Tuesday that he would probably meet with Putin before the end of the month. Rubio said: 'I don't know the timing of it.' Rubio said Trump wants to know if Russia is serious about ending the war in Ukraine, triggered by Moscow's invasion of its neighbour three years ago. 'The only way is to test them, to basically engage them and say, 'Okay, are you serious about ending the war? And if so, what are your demands? Are your public demands and your private demands different?'' Rubio said. 'The only thing we agreed upon is that we're going to talk about peace. What they offer, what they're willing to concede to, what they're willing to consider, will determine whether they're serious about peace or not,' he said. 'We're just not at that stage yet.' Trump's bid to try and end the war left Ukraine and European allies concerned they would be cut out of any peace talks, but Rubio said the U.S. has consulted with all. Trump 'Very Upset' Rubio spoke amid a widening rift between Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Trump denounced Zelenskiy as 'a dictator without elections' on Wednesday after Zelenskiy said Trump was trapped in a Russian disinformation bubble, a response to the U.S. president suggesting Ukraine started the war. 'President Trump is very upset at President Zelenskiy,' Rubio said. 'We care about (Ukraine) because it has implications for our allies and ultimately to the world. There should be some level of gratitude here.' Washington is also pushing Kyiv to quickly negotiate a deal to open up Ukraine's natural wealth to U.S. investment. The United States has provided tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine during the war and Trump has said U.S. investment in Ukrainian minerals could ensure 'that we're going to in some form get this money back.' Rubio discussed a deal in a meeting with Zelenskiy and U.S. Vice President JD Vance in Munich last Friday. 'We explained to them, 'Look, we want to be in joint venture with you, not because we're trying to steal from your country, but because we think that's actually a security guarantee, because we're your partner in an important economic endeavor',' Rubio told Herridge. 'We get to get paid back some of the money ... and also now we have a vested interest in the security of Ukraine,' he said. 'And he said, 'Sure, we want to do this deal. It makes all the sense in the world. The only thing is, I need to run it through my legislative process. They have to approve it.' Rubio said he was upset to then see Zelenskiy saying he had rejected the deal, because 'that's not what happened.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjxjhqbckx	2025-02-20T21:33:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2020/05/07/9954785/9954785_0_125_1300_732_0_small.jpg
Israel: Failure to return Shiri Bibas - gross violation of cease-...	Despite breach, Jerusalem says next phase of hostage deal to continue as planned, with six living hostages to be released on Saturday Israel said Friday that Hamas had violated the hostage release agreement by failing to return Shiri Bibas. The Bibas family was informed that she was not among the four bodies transferred Thursday to Israel’s Institute of Forensic Medicine in Abu Kabir. 'The body of the woman was examined multiple times, with several cross-checks. It does not match the DNA of any hostage and was also found with clothing. Multiple experts reviewed the findings repeatedly,' the IDF said. Following the breach of the agreement, the IDF stressed, 'Our demand to Hamas is clear—return Shiri Bibas. This message is being conveyed directly to Hamas and will also be released publicly in English and Arabic.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The military confirmed that the identification of Kfir and Ariel Bibas was swift and conclusive.

Jund al-Sham, an extremist Salafi group, held the Bibas family, and their murder took place in November 2023.' The United States has been briefed on the findings, which Israel described as 'evidence of a horrific and brutal murder.' The IDF said the forensic identification process was thorough and included determining the causes of death. 'Oded Lifshitz was murdered, and so were Ariel and Kfir,' the statement said. Despite the violation, Israel said the next phase of the hostage release deal would continue as planned. Six living hostages to be released on Saturday and five bodies next week, Shiri Bibas not included. Israel’s Coordinator for Hostages and Missing Persons, Gal Hirsch, arrived at Kfar Maccabiah overnight with IDF officials to update the Bibas family. Later, he held an urgent call with Adam Boehler, the U.S. special envoy for hostage affairs, to brief him on the latest developments. Israel has sent urgent messages to mediators, demanding Hamas uphold the deal. 'We don’t know why they did this. This is a gross violation,' an Israeli official said. 'We are demanding her return. It is critical that Saturday’s exchange proceeds as scheduled.' Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon condemned Hamas’ actions, saying, 'Hamas not only murdered Ariel and Kfir Bibas in cold blood—a four-year-old child and a ten-month-old baby—but continues to violate every basic moral principle even after their deaths. There are no words to describe such horror.' 'Instead of returning Shiri, Hamas sent an anonymous body, as if it were a worthless shipment,' Danon said. 'This is a new level of evil—unmatched cruelty.' He called on the UN Secretary-General, the Security Council, and the General Assembly to 'break their silence in the face of Hamas’ brutality.' Israel, he said, 'demands a clear and unequivocal condemnation of this heinous crime and an urgent call for Shiri’s return to her family. History will remember who stood by in silence while Hamas trampled on human dignity.' As part of the next phase of the deal, six living hostages are expected to be freed Saturday. They include Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, along with four hostages classified as ill or wounded—Omer Wenkert, Elia Cohen, Tal Shahem, and Omer Shem Tov. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjgqicbcke	2025-02-20T21:13:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/20/SJl00DMAE5ke/SJl00DMAE5ke_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Hamas indoctrination is 'atrocious,' says expert as hostages are ...	Ruth Wasserman-Lande: 'They are manipulating and quite literally kidnapping their own population' The level of Hamas indoctrination throughout the Gaza Strip is 'atrocious,' according to Ruth Wasserman-Lande, a senior fellow at the Misgav Institute. 'They are manipulating and quite literally kidnapping their own population for over 16 years already in order to indoctrinate them and incite them in mosques, in cultural centers, in the media, in every aspect of human life, of course, including the curriculum and the educational system,' Wasserman-Lande told ILTV News on Thursday, as crowds—including children—gathered in Khan Yunis to watch the release of four Israeli hostages. Hamas released Kfir and Ariel Bibas and Oded Lifschitz. It also returned a woman’s body, which was supposed to be that of the Bibas children's mother, Shiri Bibas. However, a forensic evaluation revealed that Hamas had sent a different body instead. 'All of this was done throughout the years with the help and the aid of foreign money that was funded and channeled through Hamas and through UNRWA,' Wasserman-Lande continued, explaining how Hamas was able to indoctrinate its population. 'These [Gazan] kids that are watching this absolutely preposterous theater of manipulation and cynicism—they're learning to kill, they're learning to murder babies, they're learning to really abuse human lives. 'And I cannot but wonder who, in their right mind, can justify any of this horrific human behavior,' Wasserman-Lande concluded.

Syrian Jews revisit Damascus after Assad’s fall	Inside the last remaining synagogue in Damascus, Rabbi Joseph Hamra and his son Henry read from a Torah scroll When President Bashar al-Assad was overthrown in December, the Hamra family began organizing a visit to Damascus—something that had once seemed unimaginable. With assistance from the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a U.S.-based advocacy group, they set out to reconnect with their roots. During their visit, they met with Syria’s deputy foreign minister at the ministry, now overseen by caretaker authorities appointed by the Islamist rebels who ended more than 50 years of Assad family rule. The new leadership has pledged that all of Syria’s communities will have a role in shaping the country’s future. Inside the last remaining synagogue in Damascus, Rabbi Joseph Hamra and his son Henry read from a Torah scroll, reliving a piece of Syria’s lost Jewish history. Once home to thousands, the Jewish community in Damascus now numbers fewer than ten. 'I want to see my kids come back and see this beautiful synagogue. It’s a work of art,' said Henry Hamra, son of Rabbi Joseph Hamra. But much of that history has been erased. The ancient Jobar Synagogue—believed to have been built in honor of the prophet Elijah—was looted and reduced to rubble during Syria’s civil war. 'We need the government’s security, and it's going to happen. We spoke to the foreign minister yesterday, and he promised us that it's going to be his priority,' Hamra said. The delegation met with Syria’s new leadership, who pledged to protect Jewish heritage. But as the country reshapes its future, questions remain: Will Syria’s Jewish past truly be safeguarded? And could this visit signal the beginning of something new? For now, it remains a return to the past—one filled with hopes for what the future might bring.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkfvycscyx	2025-02-20T20:37:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/21/S1DJWcS9kl/S1DJWcS9kl_0_41_680_383_0_small.jpg
Why Did Netanyahu not take Trump up on his offer to have 'all hel...	Ruthie Blum: 'Anyone who suggests that Netanyahu only cares about his coalition and keeping his seat and doesn't care about the hostages is being immoral' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not take U.S. President Donald Trump up on his offer to return to war but instead secured the release of three hostages from Gaza last week. He made this choice because he was 'stuck between a rock and a hard place,' according to Ruthie Blum, senior contributing editor for JNS. Blum explained that had Netanyahu refused the three hostages and sent the army back into Gaza to 'blitz the crap out of everybody,' Hamas would not have returned any captives. He would then have been blamed for endangering lives he could have saved. 'Anyone who suggests that Netanyahu only cares about his coalition and keeping his seat and doesn't care about the hostages, I think, is being immoral because that isn't true,' Blum said during ILTV’s Insider earlier this week. 'He's actually trying to satisfy as much of the Israeli public as he can, and that is an impossible task.'

Should Israel Consider a Nuclear Strike on Iran? Will Trump’s Return Rewrite Middle East History? On Thursday, Hamas returned the bodies of four hostages to Israel. However, DNA tests confirmed only three of them: Kfir and Ariel Bibas, who were found to have been brutally murdered in captivity, and Oded Lifshitz. The body of Shiri Bibas, Kfir and Ariel’s mother, did not match the expected DNA. The IDF condemned the act, stating, 'This is a very serious violation by the terrorist organization Hamas, which is required by the agreement to return four dead hostages. We demand that Hamas return Shiri home along with all of our hostages.' Another six hostages are expected to be released on Saturday, including two who have been held since 2014 and 2015: Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed. The other four—Tal Shoham, Omer Shem-Tov, Omer Wenkert, and Eliya Cohen—were kidnapped on October 7.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjoz5ksqyg	2025-02-20T20:16:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/BkKUHcDYJe/BkKUHcDYJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

The IDF announced early Friday that it is deploying three additional battalions to the West Bank, following a series of coordinated bus bombings in the Tel Aviv area. The decision, made by IDF Central Command, comes amid heightened security concerns after multiple explosive devices detonated on Israeli buses Thursday night. While no casualties were reported, the incidents have been linked to Palestinian terrorist groups. 'The IDF continues to conduct ongoing assessments and is prepared to expand offensive operations. Counterterrorism operations in northern Samaria are ongoing,' the military said in a statement. 'The IDF will continue to operate both defensively and offensively to ensure the security of Israeli civilians.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered security forces to 'carry out an intensified operation against terror strongholds,' though details of the planned response have not been disclosed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by3kirr9kg	2025-02-20T15:39:53-08:00	
Report: Egypt to present alternative Gaza plan, aiming to counter...	Proposal includes 10-year reconstruction plan, population redistribution, international oversight of weapons and eventual Palestinian statehood; alternative to Trump’s controversial displacement proposal to be discussed at upcoming summits in Riyadh, Cairo Egypt is advancing a two-stage plan for the Gaza Strip, which it aims to present to U.S. President Donald Trump after gaining approval at upcoming summits in Riyadh and Cairo, the Qatari newspaper The New Arab reported Thursday, citing Egyptian diplomatic sources in Washington and Arab League officials. The Egyptian initiative is reportedly designed as a practical alternative to Trump's controversial proposal, which includes the relocation of Gaza’s 2 million residents. An Egyptian diplomat in Washington detailed the first stage of the plan, which is expected to last 10 years and focus on reconstruction, development and infrastructure projects, while preparing for a broader long-term solution to the Palestinian issue. The plan envisions a redistribution of residential areas, reducing population density in northern Gaza and establishing low-population 'safe zones' near Israeli border communities. The proposal also includes restrictions on Palestinian armed factions, aiming to monitor but not completely disarm them. According to sources, Egypt proposes designated weapons storage sites in Gaza, to be overseen by European and Egyptian monitors. To manage local security and governance disputes, Egypt intends to establish an Arab-led committee, which would function as an extension of the existing Egyptian-Qatari committee overseeing the return of displaced Gazans to the north. Additionally, the continued operation of an American security firm currently active in the area is envisioned, though limited to three key contact points between Gaza and Israel. The second stage of the plan would move toward establishing a Palestinian state, with discussions on connecting Gaza, the West Bank and Jerusalem. According to an Arab diplomat, a Gulf state recently consulted Israeli and American officials about the plan, expressing concern that Egypt's refusal to encourage Gaza’s depopulation could entrench armed resistance and jeopardize long-term investment efforts. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israeli officials have also reportedly voiced opposition to the plan’s exclusion of Israeli oversight in Gaza's reconstruction, fearing it could facilitate a resurgence of Hamas’ military strength. Sources cited by The New Arab said the primary obstacle to implementing the Egyptian plan is Israel’s insistence on supervising Gaza’s reconstruction, amid security concerns. Egypt’s plan reportedly calls for construction materials to enter Gaza through Rafah instead of Kerem Shalom, with Egyptian firms playing a central role in rebuilding efforts. To push the plan forward, Egypt is seeking Arab backing to pressure the U.S. into influencing Israel's position. Discussions on the matter are expected to take place at the Riyadh summit on Friday, while Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has reportedly raised the issue in talks with Western and Arab leaders. Meanwhile, reports indicate that Arab states are developing a $20 billion counterproposal to Trump’s Gaza evacuation plan. At a recent investment conference in Miami, Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff defended Trump’s plan, clarifying that the relocation of Gaza’s residents was meant to provoke discussion rather than promote forced displacement. He added that Gaza's reconstruction would require a complete redesign and could take more than five years. Arab leaders are expected to present their own alternative framework at a Cairo summit in early March, offering an investment-driven approach to stabilizing and rebuilding Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk0keqscjx	2025-02-20T15:32:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/12/H19xR4qKyl/H19xR4qKyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Quick-thinking passenger prevents mass casualties in coordinated ...	Vigilant passenger helps avert potential tragedy in one of Bat Yam bus explosions; spotting suspicious bag in back seat, she alerts driver, who immediately drove to terminal and called police; moments later, device detonated, but by sheer luck, bus already empty A vigilant passenger in Bat Yam helped prevent a potential mass-casualty attack Thursday night when she spotted a suspicious bag on a public bus and alerted the driver—just minutes before an explosive device detonated inside the empty vehicle. The driver, acting swiftly on the warning, diverted the bus to a terminal, called police, and evacuated the area. Shortly after, a powerful blast tore through the bus, but no one was hurt. The explosion was part of a coordinated and premeditated attack targeting three buses in different locations. Officials confirmed that improvised explosive devices (IEDs), each weighing around 5 kilograms (11 pounds), had been placed on multiple buses. The explosives were marked with the phrase 'Revenge for Tulkarm.' A Hamas-linked group in the West Bank later hinted at responsibility. Dan Bus Company CEO Ofir Karni praised the passenger’s awareness and the driver’s decisive actions, saying they had prevented a catastrophic loss of life. 'This was a well-organized attack across multiple locations,' Karni said. 'Fortunately, in two other cases, security teams discovered and neutralized the devices before they could go off.' Shmuel Malka, a first responder from United Hatzalah, arrived at the scene of the first blast on Menachem Begin Street: 'I saw a bus with its rear section blown apart. We started searching for casualties, but thankfully, the vehicle had already been emptied. Just as we finished, another explosion hit Ha’amal Street, and then a third bus exploded nearby within minutes.' Eran Carmel, a paramedic with Magen David Adom’s emergency motorcycle unit, called it a miracle that no one was injured. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We were searching the first blast site when we heard another explosion and rushed over. Then a third bus blew up. We’re staying on high alert for any further threats.' Following the attacks, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was briefed and held an emergency security assessment. Transportation Minister Miri Regev ordered a temporary halt to all public transportation nationwide for safety inspections. Police urged the public to remain alert and report suspicious objects as the investigation continues. Police Commissioner Dani Levy visited one of the blast sites to oversee the response. A senior Tel Aviv police official said the devices were timer-based and resembled those commonly used in the West Bank. Israeli Railways also increased security at overnight parking lots, and heightened security measures were enacted across the country. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkw1ehb51g	2025-02-20T15:17:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/20/H1kkqfHqyl/H1kkqfHqyl_272_204_2615_1472_0_small.jpg

Sabrina Ajmechet's criticism follows images of Hamas and other terrorist groups staging a 'ceremony' for hostage bodies before their transfer to Israel Argentine lawmaker Sabrina Ajmechet on Thursday criticized human rights organizations for their lack of response to images showing Hamas and other terrorist groups staging a 'ceremony' before transferring the bodies of four murdered hostages to Israel. Photos from Gaza earlier in the day showed armed terrorists carrying coffins they claimed contained the remains of Kfir and Ariel Bibas—both Argentine citizens—before handing them over to Israeli authorities. '‘Date of arrest: 07/10/2023’—this is what these evildoers wrote on the coffins,' Ajmechet, who chairs Argentina’s Human Rights Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, wrote on X. 'This was not an arrest: they were kidnapped. They were torn from their homes and returned in coffins.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Drawing a parallel to Argentina’s history of forced disappearances under military rule, Ajmechet condemned what she described as a double standard. 'We are a country with a painful history, where babies were taken alive from their mothers—never to be heard from again. Human rights organizations have dedicated decades to these cases. And today, those same institutions and individuals are silent. Or worse—they defend the murderers of Kfir and Ariel, turning the attackers into victims.' Ajmechet also questioned the broader public’s response. 'I cannot understand the silence of most Argentines in the face of what is happening. I do not want to think it is because these babies were Jewish. I would like to understand why they remain silent in the face of such barbarism, such inhuman cruelty.' Earlier Thursday, Argentine President Javier Milei announced a national day of mourning after Hamas confirmed the deaths of the Bibas mother and children. Milei also shared images of the Bibas family, emphasizing their Argentine citizenship. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkk4b11hckg	2025-02-20T12:44:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/06/Hkf6tPJPw0/Hkf6tPJPw0_0_65_768_433_0_small.jpg

Putin thanks Hamas for release of Russian Israeli hostage, ignore...	Russian president praises terror group for releasing Sasha Troufanov but sidesteps return of 4 Israeli hostages' bodies; Israeli officials condemns Russian media for falsely blaming Israel for their deaths Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday praised Hamas for the release of Russian-Israeli hostage Alexander 'Sasha' Troufanov but made no mention of the bodies of four Israeli hostages, including a mother and her two young children, who were returned to Israel earlier in the day. During a meeting at the Kremlin with Russia’s Chief Rabbi Berel Lazar, Putin said he wished to send 'best regards to Alexander Troufanov and his loved ones on his release from captivity.' He credited the development to Russia’s 'consistent policy in ensuring Middle East stability, which has earned the trust of many partners in the region.' Putin went on to thank Hamas leaders, saying, 'I know the efforts were not easy, but he and his family endured this period. Thank God he is home, surrounded by his loved ones.' His remarks were in stark contrast to Russian state media’s coverage of the return of four Israeli hostage bodies earlier in the day. The Russian television network RT posted on social media that 'Hamas carried four coffins, including those of small children, who were killed by war criminal Netanyahu.' Another report by RT described Hamas gunmen at the transfer as 'resistance fighters carrying weapons in Gaza.' The Israeli Embassy in Moscow issued a sharp rebuke, condemning the reports as 'not only entirely unprofessional but also deeply antisemitic and malicious.' The embassy called on RT to 'immediately correct the damage to its credibility.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The broadcaster later removed to posts. 'We have deleted two posts from earlier today, concerning the hostage handover in Gaza,' it wrote on X. 'While we do not shy away from difficult subjects, these posts misrepresented the events in question. We remain committed to unflinching but fair coverage of the conflict.' Israeli Ambassador to Russia Simona Halperin commended RT for its decision. 'On this sad day for us in Israel, I appreciate the decision of @RT to do the right thing - correct what needed to be corrected, a horrible misrepresentation of the brutal yet another Hamas demonstrations of cruelty, and uphold its role as a media outlet. [A]appreciated,' she wrote. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, Russian state media—largely under government control—has repeatedly accused Israel of war crimes while aligning itself with Palestinian factions, including Hamas. Moscow’s stance comes despite years of Israel maintaining a careful diplomatic balance with Russia under Netanyahu, refraining from criticism even amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Analysts have pointed to Israel’s past efforts to preserve coordination with Russia, particularly regarding Israeli airstrikes targeting Iranian weapons shipments in Syria. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkfjjgb91g	2025-02-20T12:29:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/20/BJGJQxScyx/BJGJQxScyx_0_91_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Authorities report no casualties in both incidents as police and Shin Bet investigate; one explosion sparks fire, quickly contained by firefighters Two explosions rocked bus depots in the central city of Bat Yam on Thursday evening in what authorities suspect was a failed terror attack.

Police spokesperson Aryeh Doron said that all possible leads are being investigated and emphasized the importance of public vigilance. The first blast occurred at a bus parking lot near the city's stadium, followed by a second explosion at another nearby lot.

Vance to hostage families: 'Trump's going to fight every single d...	You need a president who is able to pick up the phone and say: ‘You’ve got to bring these people home,' US VP tells CPAC; Witkoff says president's Gaza plan not about evicting Palestinians, but create better future for them U.S. Vice President JD Vance told to the families of the hostage held in Gaza on Thursday that President Donald Trump will 'fight every single day' to bring their loved ones back. 'Our message to the hostages is that President Trump loves you, he hasn’t forgotten your loved ones and he’s going to fight every single day to bring them home. That is exactly what he has been doing, and that’s what he’ll keep on doing,' Vance told the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington, DC, which had several relatives of hostages in attendance. 'It’s just a question of leadership. You need a president who is able to pick up the phone and say: ‘You’ve got to bring these people home. No, no no no. We’re not focused on that crap right now. We’re focused on bringing hostages home.’ 'And then, when negotiations hit a wall because they always do, you need a president who gets on the phone and says: ‘Cut this crap out. You’ve got to make progress. You’ve got to keep that pace going.’ It’s leadership. I saw it behind the scenes.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Vance also acknowledged the crucial role Trump's Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff played in the latest rounds of negotiations. 'What the president did was empower… his dear friend Steve Witkoff as an emissary of the United States,' he said. 'He said: ‘Steve, you speak for me. Get it done. And if there are problems, call me.’ Steve Witkoff, with the president’s leadership, got it done.' Earlier today Witkoff said that Trump's plan for Gaza was not about evicting Palestinians, and the conversation about Gaza's future was being shifted towards how to create a better future for Palestinians. Trump proposed on February 4 that the U.S. should take over Gaza, with Palestinians resettled in other places including Egypt and Jordan, a suggestion that caused an international outcry. However, speaking at a Miami conference hosted by a non-profit linked to the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund, Witkoff said that Trump's comments on Gaza were more about trying different solutions to those proposed over the previous 50 years. He said that the war between Israel and Hamas has left much of Gaza destroyed and littered with unexploded ordnance, and it was impossible to see how people could return. 'It's going to take a lot of clean-up and imagination, and a great master plan, and that doesn't mean we're on an eviction plan, when the President talks about this,' Witkoff told the FII Institute event. 'It means he wants to shake up everyone's thinking, and think about what is compelling and what is the best solution for the Palestinian people. 'For instance, do they want to live in a home there, or would they rather have an opportunity to resettle in some sort of better place, to have jobs, upside and financial prospects,' he added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk8szeh91e	2025-02-20T10:07:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/Bkx00IGOTFJe/Bkx00IGOTFJe_1_14_800_451_0_small.jpg

The Russian president noted that efforts to secure Tropunov’s release 'were not easy' and added, 'Thank God he is home, surrounded by his loved ones.' Putin claimed that Tropunov’s return was, in part, 'thanks to the Russian Federation’s consistent policy of stabilizing the Middle East, which has fostered trust among many partners in the region.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byavclbc1e	2025-02-20T09:55:26-08:00

UN envoy says inclusive Syrian government could help lift sanctio...	Geir Pedersen says remains concerned over Israel's presence in on Syrian Hermon; 'The solution is very simple: the Israelis need to withdraw' Creating an inclusive government in Syria in the coming weeks will help determine whether Western sanctions are lifted as the country rebuilds after the ouster of former President Bashar Assad, the UN special envoy to Syria said Thursday. 'What I’m hoping is that with a truly new inclusive government in place on the 1st of March, this will help us in lifting sanctions' imposed on Syria by Western countries during Assad’s rule, Geir Pedersen told The Associated Press in an interview during a visit to Damascus. After Assad was toppled in a lightning rebel offensive in December, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the main former rebel group now in control of Syria, set up an interim administration comprising mainly members of its 'salvation government' that had ruled in northwestern Syria. The country’s de facto authorities said at the time that a new government would be formed through an inclusive process by March. In January, former HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa was named Syria’s interim president after a meeting of most of the country’s former rebel factions. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In recent weeks, a committee has been holding meetings in different parts of Syria in preparation for a national dialogue conference to chart the country’s political future, the date of which has not yet been announced. Pedersen said that in his first meeting with al-Sharaa in December, al-Sharaa had insisted that the interim government would rule for only three months, although Pedersen warned him the timeline was tight. 'I think the important thing is not whether it is three months or not, but it is whether they will deliver on what they have said all along, that this is going to be an inclusive process where all Syrians will be included,' Pedersen said. The U.S. and European countries have not lifted sanctions that were imposed on the Syrian government under Assad’s rule, which the new authorities have said is handicapping their ability to rebuild the country after nearly 14 years of civil war and restore essential services like state electricity. Officials from some Western countries have said they want to see if the interim rulers will follow through on their promises of inclusive governance and protecting minorities. Organizers of the national dialogue have said the conference will include all segments of Syrian society except for Assad loyalists and the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led force in the northeast that has so far refused to dissolve and be absorbed into the new national army. The SDF is currently in negotiations with the central government, and Pedersen said he hopes to see a 'political solution' to the impasse. Pedersen said he is also concerned about a security vacuum following the disbanding of the former national army and security services by the country’s new rulers. 'It’s very important that the new structures of the state are coming in place quickly and that there is an offer to those who are no longer in service of the army or the security services, that there are other job opportunities and that people do not feel that they are excluded from the future of Syria,' he said. The UN envoy said he also remains concerned about Israel’s incursions into Syrian territory since the fall of Assad. The IDF has seized a UN-patrolled buffer zone in the Golan Heights established by a 1974 cease-fire agreement with Syria and has also made forays beyond the buffer zone. The UN has said that Israel is violating the agreement. Israeli officials have said they took the action to protect Israel’s security and that their presence would be temporary. Pedersen said the security concerns are being addressed and 'there is really, in my opinion, no argument for why the Israelis should be staying.' 'The solution is very simple. The Israelis need to withdraw,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hktntre5yx	2025-02-20T09:33:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/17/SyXt4l1HJg/SyXt4l1HJg_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Father of Tanzanian student killed by Hamas honors son with Hebre...	Clemence Mtenga, 22-year-old Tanzanian agricultural student, murdered by terrorists at Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7, just weeks after arriving in Israel for training program; Hebrew verse from Book of Deuteronomy inscribed on his gravestone in his home village In a small village in the Rombo region of Tanzania, near the Kenyan border, Felix Mtenga made a heartfelt request to members of the Imagine Israel Africa association: to choose a Hebrew phrase to inscribe on the gravestone of his late son, Clemence Mtenga. Clemence, just 22 years old, was brutally murdered outside his room at Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7, only three weeks after arriving in Israel. He had come to study agriculture as part of a program aimed at improving his family’s financial situation. Clemence was one of 260 Tanzanian students participating in an agricultural training initiative as part of a cooperation program between Israel and Tanzania. The association fulfilled the grieving father’s request, selecting a verse from the Book of Deuteronomy: 'When you besiege a city for a long time, making war against it in order to capture it, you shall not destroy its [fruit-bearing] trees by swinging an axe against them; for you may eat from them, and you shall not cut them down. For is the tree of the field a man, that it should be besieged (destroyed) by you?' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On that fateful Saturday—his day off—Clemence chose to remain at the kibbutz. Initially feared to have been taken hostage, his body was later found outside his room and identified 41 days later through DNA testing. Liraz Madar, a board member of the association and coordinator of delegations to Tanzania, visited the bereaved family. 'The family received us warmly, with immense respect and gratitude,' she wrote in an emotional Facebook post. 'The father is a hardworking man who raised successful, educated children.' Honoring Clemence’s legacy The association has committed to supporting the Mtenga family, who are now receiving a victims-of-terror stipend from the State of Israel, and to memorializing Clemence in his home village and the schools supported by the association. 'We promised to establish an excellence fund in his name so that every delegation promoting excellence in various fields will award prizes to two outstanding students,' Madar explained. As early as October, two seventh-grade students received a mathematics excellence scholarship in Clemence’s memory, and two more students are expected to receive the scholarship in April. 'The phrase inscribed on the gravestone comes from the Book of Deuteronomy,' Madar elaborated. 'One interpretation is that it is forbidden to harm an innocent person, just as it is forbidden to harm a tree that bears fruit and is not part of the conflict.' A father’s faith Clemence’s father, a devout Christian, shared a moving perspective: for his family, Clemence has returned to his ancestors in Israel, and they believe his death in Israel was no coincidence. Recently, Felix, who now works as a welder for the association, sent a photo of the gravestone with the Hebrew inscription prominently displayed. 'The verse from Deuteronomy 20:19-20 reminds us of the sanctity of life,' Madar emphasized. 'It highlights the principle that one must not harm the innocent, just as one must not harm a tree that is uninvolved in the conflict.' 'I cannot explain the odds that, out of 65 million people, the student who was killed happened to be the son of a man known to our association, in a village where we volunteer,' Madar reflected. 'The pain of October 7 transcends continents and religions. I hope this tragedy will come to an end, that the hostages will return, the war will cease, and we will find a way to heal and grow from what remains.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hkwwn6nq1x	2025-02-20T09:27:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/18/rkXFBGLEa/rkXFBGLEa_0_126_400_226_0_small.jpg

After Oded Lifshitz’s body identified, process continues for three others—whom Hamas claims are Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas; hundreds of Israelis gather near forensic institute, holding orange balloons, Israeli flags and 'Sorry' signs The National Center for Forensic Medicine is set to make an official announcement Thursday evening regarding the identification of three of the four bodies transferred from Hamas custody. Earlier in the day, the family of 85-year-old Oded Lifshitz confirmed his identification, while the Bibas family anxiously awaits confirmation on whether the other remains belong to Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, as Hamas has claimed. Hundreds of Israelis gathered along the roads without any formal call to do so, lining the route taken by the convoy carrying the hostages' remains from Gaza to the forensic center in Tel Aviv. Silent and solemn, they held Israeli flags, orange balloons symbolizing the red-haired Bibas children, and signs reading 'Forgive us.' Elderly women recited Psalms, teenagers stood with tear-streaked faces and a man clutching a balloon watched in silence. Political debates and media controversies surrounding the hostage deal were absent in the quiet crowd. As the procession passed, a man shouted, 'Wherever the convoy goes, the rain starts. The heavens are crying, believe me, the heavens are crying.' Dark clouds rolled in, muting the colors of the balloons and ribbons tied to trees in a symbolic moment. 'We came to pay our final respects to the babies murdered by these monsters. We couldn’t stay home,' said Uri, one of the mourners. Another attendee, Nava, expressed her anguish: 'I came to ask for forgiveness. This is the least we can do. My family lives in Nahal Oz; by chance, they survived. I feel terrible.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Many spoke of an overwhelming sense of duty, explaining that they could not go about their daily routines on such a day. 'A colleague called me from work, and I couldn't understand how he could even sit at his computer,' said Nirit from Tel Aviv. Eli and Anat from Rishon Lezion added, 'The entire country should be here today. This is a national day of mourning. Everything should have been shut down.' As the convoy reached its destination, a heavy silence filled the air. 'We abandoned those babies. It’s unbearable. We left them for over 500 days,' said Osnat, struggling to hold back tears. Others recounted how they had been watching the news at home but felt compelled to come in person. 'We couldn’t just sit there anymore,' said Eli. 'We had to be part of this moment.' Then, as the vehicles carrying the hostages' remains approached, the mourners broke into an impromptu rendition of Israel’s national anthem, Hatikvah.

Oded Lifshitz - A man of peace and of the land	The 85-year-old grandfather and great-grandfather, who died in Gaza captivity after he was abducted on October 7, was one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz After over 500 days in Gaza captivity, the family of Oded Lifshitz said in a statement on Thursday that the body of their father and grandfather, who was returned to Israel this morning from the Gaza Strip, has been positively identified at the Institute for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv. '503 agonizing days of uncertainty have come to an end,' the family said. 'We had hoped and prayed so much that our end would be different. Now we can mourn the husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather we have been missing since October 7. Rebuilding our family will begin now and will not end until the last hostage is returned.' The Hostages, Missing Persons and Returnees Directorate of the Prime Minister's Office extended condolences to the Lifshitz family, stating, 'We bow our heads and send our sympathies; we will continue to support the family. We pray for the swift return of all hostages.'

As he returns home, my heart is with his family. May the memory of this gentle man and his life be a blessing.' Lifshitz, 85, was one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz and had ten grandchildren and one great-grandchild. He was abducted from his home along with his wife, Yocheved Lifshitz, who was later released in a hostage deal in November 2023. Yocheved recounted that on the morning of the October 7 massacre, Oded tried to close the door to their safe room, but the attackers shot him in the hand. She was taken away on a motorbike while Oded lay unconscious and bleeding at their doorstep. It was later revealed that the captors dressed him in a galabiya and held him for 20 days with fellow hostage Hanna Katzir, who was also later freed. Oded and Yocheved Lifshitz created a renowned cactus garden in Nir Oz. Their grandson, Daniel, said, 'My grandfather came to Nir Oz in 1956. The kibbutz was the life’s work of both him and my grandmother.' Oded was also a longtime peace activist who transported Palestinian cancer patients from Gaza to receive treatment in Israeli hospitals. His son, Yizhar, said this week that his father 'ended his life in a tragic, humiliating, and degrading way—unworthy and disgraceful. This was the fate of so many in Kibbutz Nir Oz. His home was burned, his wife was kidnapped and beaten before his eyes. Horrific. He was left without family, without children, without closure.' Describing the tragedy experienced by many families, he said, 'Hostages lived through an entire existence in there without us, under terrible conditions, and that void will always remain.' He also spoke of the painful sense of loss: 'When some come back alive and others don’t, you feel the missed chance. But I don't compare myself to parents who lost children—my father was 84 when he was kidnapped. He had grandchildren; he lived a full life.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/skbpkp49yg	2025-02-20T07:21:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/20/B19I00pV5yg/B19I00pV5yg_0_371_591_333_0_small.jpg

Israel, UN slam Hamas for 'abhorrent' display of hostage remains	Israel protests to mediators and Red Cross over 'sickening ceremony,' which it says violated prior agreements; UN human rights chief also condemns act The United Nations and Israeli officials condemned Hamas on Thursday after the terror group publicly displayed the bodies of four Israeli hostages before handing them over to the Red Cross. UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk called the act 'abhorrent' and a violation of international law. 'Under international law, any handover of remains must comply with the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, ensuring respect for the dignity of the deceased and their families,' Türk said in a statement. The hostages, including Israeli infant Kfir Bibas, his 4-year-old brother Ariel, their mother Shiri Bibas and 85-year-old Oded Lifshitz, were transferred to Israel on Thursday as part of the cease-fire agreement reached last month.

Israel confirms remains of hostage Oded Lifshitz identified as fa...	Forensic teams begin identification after thousands gather to honor convoy carrying 4 hostages’ remains; 85-year-old's family confirms his identity, mourning the loss; Hamas claims other victims are Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas The remains of Oded Lifshitz, 85, have been officially identified at the National Center for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv, his family confirmed Thursday, hours after his remains were returned to Israel from the Gaza Strip. 'After 503 agonizing days of uncertainty, we have received the devastating news,' the family said in a statement. 'We had hoped and prayed for a different outcome. Now, we can finally mourn our husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather, whom we have missed since October 7. Our family’s healing begins now and will not be complete until the last hostage is brought home.' Earlier Thursday, the bodies of four hostages—Lifshitz, along with Shiri, Kfir and Ariel Bibas, according to Hamas—were transferred to Israel from the Gaza Strip. Their remains were delivered in a Red Cross convoy and received by Israeli forces, including members of the IDF’s 50th Battalion and Chief Military Rabbi Brig. Gen. Eyal Krim, in a brief military ceremony. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the nation following the announcement, saying: 'My dear brothers and sisters, citizens of Israel, today we are all united in unbearable grief. Every home in Israel bows its head in sorrow. We mourn the terrible loss of our four hostages, and we all share in a pain that is mixed with rage. We are all outraged at the monsters of Hamas.' Netanyahu vowed that the tragedy reinforced Israel’s commitment to ensuring such atrocities never happen again. 'The blood of our loved ones cries out to us from the earth. It demands that we hold these vile murderers accountable—and we will. Our hearts are broken, but our spirit remains unshaken. With this resolve, we will bring all our hostages home, eliminate the murderers, destroy Hamas and—God willing—secure our future.' Defense Minister Israel Katz also offered condolences while warning Hamas of its fate. 'The heart of the entire nation mourns today. Hamas kidnapped, Hamas murdered and Hamas will be destroyed. We will avenge our enemies and secure our future.' The Hostages and Missing Persons Directorate also expressed condolences to the Lifshitz family, pledging continued support. 'We bow our heads in sorrow and send our deepest sympathies to the family. We will continue to stand by them through these difficult moments and pray for the swift return of all the hostages.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Thousands of Israelis lined the roads to honor the convoy, waving national flags, while crowds gathered outside the forensic institute in Tel Aviv, singing Israel’s national anthem, Hatikvah. Health Minister Uriel Buso said forensic teams would work diligently to confirm the victims’ identities and determine their causes of death, a process that 'may take time.' DNA samples had been collected from families early in the war to assist in identification, and forensic experts will use additional imaging, microscopic analysis and autopsies where necessary. 'The goal is to provide definitive identification and, where possible, information about how they died,' said Dr. Chen Kugel, head of the forensic institute. He noted that prolonged captivity complicates such determinations but pledged to do 'everything possible to provide clarity for the families.' The transfer of the bodies was marred by controversy, with Israeli officials condemning Hamas for what they described as a 'cruel and grotesque spectacle' during the handover, which was also denounced by the United Nations. Israel has formally protested the incident to mediating nations and the Red Cross, accusing Hamas of violating prior agreements. The Prime Minister’s Office confirmed the arrival of the bodies and urged the public to respect the privacy of the grieving families. 'This is a painful moment. We ask the public to avoid spreading unverified information and rely only on official updates,' the statement read. The Israeli public, deeply shaken by the hostage crisis, continues to rally for the return of those still held in Gaza. 'All the hostages must come home,' the Lifshitz family emphasized. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyyzdnv5yl	2025-02-20T05:36:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/20/SybX43NcJx/SybX43NcJx_133_14_561_316_0_small.jpg

Rescued hostage Luis Harr says transfer of hostages' bodies 'was ...	Harr, who was rescued from Rafah in an IDF operation, tells Ynet that, despite the tragedy of the return of dead hostages, 'the circle is closed - and the families can begin to live and move on with the loss'; He has worked in the struggle to bring the hostages home: 'When I was rescued and they gave me my life back I realized I had a mission.' Former hostage Luis Harr, who was rescued from Rafah in Operation Golden Hand in February 2024 after 129 days in captivity, spoke with Ynet Thursday and shared his feelings regarding the return of the killed hostages Oded Lifshitz and Shiri Bibas along with with her children Kfir and Ariel. 'It's hard to accept this,' he told Ynet, 'We were hoping for a miracle.' Harr, who was kidnapped from Gaza border Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak along with Fernando Marman - who was rescued with him, shared: 'It's a strange feeling. As if we should have been prepared for this, and yet it's not enough. We constantly had the fear that the four were really not among the living, but we wanted to believe that maybe a miracle would happen, maybe something that would change reality.' He said, 'We need to understand that, even if it's about the fallen, it closes the circle, it reassures the families that it's final. There's no more 'maybe yes-maybe no,' which is what's so difficult for families during this time, that there's no end to it. The circle is closed and these families can start living a more normal, quieter life - without expectations - and move on with the loss. It's a loss for all of us, for the entire family of the hostage. We feel sorry for everyone. At least we know they're not suffering anymore.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Harr explained his decision to take part in the struggle to return the hostages, in which he appears at rallies and is interviewed by the media. 'It came from within,' he said. 'When the soldiers from the Yamam unit rescued me and gave me my life back, I realized that I also have a mission. This is my mission: to help everyone, to give hope to everyone, to give light, as if I was chosen for getting my life back, and I fulfill it as much as possible. I can't sit quietly at home and do nothing.' We heard Avital Dekel-Chen talk about Sagui's feelings of guilt, and she said that he reads a story to his daughters and some fathers can't 'We are divided, our hearts are divided. One half is with the joy: I was rescued, I'm here, I'm alive, with my grandchildren and children. The other half is constantly thinking about all the kidnapped people who are still there. They want to end it, and everything revolves around that. How can I rehabilitate myself, if I constantly think about those who haven't returned yet? I haven't returned home yet, I'm not in a normal life, it will never go back to what it was. I need to learn about my new life. I want to do it together with everyone, which means everyone will be here. And for the families' suffering to end.' We are at the end of Phase I of the deal, and on Saturday six hostages will return alive. According to estimates, 24 hostages remain alive in captivity in horrific conditions. What goes through your mind when you hear the testimonies? 'I say that we need to bring everyone home as quickly as possible. The price doesn't matter, nothing matters. First of all, bring everyone home. That's why I agree with everything we talked about before. The peace of the families, starting to return to a more normal life, because we can't continue with the not knowing. Whether they come or not, fallen or not, we need to get it over with, bring everyone. Either for rehabilitation or to a proper Israeli burial, everyone.' Harr said that he never received a visit or a phone call from the decision-makers. 'I did not even receive a phone call from any of those who actually make decisions. It is very strange to me, because without their signature I could not be here, so it is not that they do not know. I should thank them for this, I can only thank them, but I have no one - because I have no contact with anyone.' When asked what he thought was the explanation for not contacting him, he replied: 'I try not to explain to myself or anyone. I live my life, I am at peace with myself. I do my own thing and work for all the hostages, giving hope, giving light, if someone does not want to talk to me, that is their problem, not mine.' F>ound an error?

A new Lebanon opens up, 20 years after assassination of Rafic Har...	His assassination — along with the killing of 21 others in the explosion of a 1,000-kilogram TNT bomb — marked a breaking point in Lebanon The sky opened up for the Hariris. After two weeks of relentless rain, Beirut awoke to a sunny day for the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. Thousands of people from across Lebanon gathered to honor the memory of the late prime minister, who was killed on a cold Valentine’s Day in 2005. His assassination — along with the killing of 21 others in the explosion of a 1,000-kilogram TNT bomb — marked a turning point in Lebanon. A large segment of the population aligned with the anti-Syrian camp, blaming the Syrian regime for orchestrating the attack. Lilian Abdelrahman was nine years old when she heard the explosion that shook Lebanon. 'I was at school, and we were shocked and very upset,' she recalled from Martyrs’ Square in Beirut during the commemoration of that tragic day. 'It was terrifying, and it was a very ugly day for Lebanon because Rafic Hariri was a very great person, and there will be no one like him again,' she said. Rafic Hariri, a towering political figure, had resigned as prime minister nearly four months earlier. He was Lebanon’s first post-civil war premier and was widely credited for his role in drafting the Taif Agreement, which ended the 15-year conflict. As a businessman, he played a major role in rebuilding Beirut and became the most influential and wealthiest Lebanese politician of his time. During his two terms (1992-1998 and 2000-2004), he sought to strengthen Lebanese sovereignty and limit foreign interference, particularly from Syria and Iran. But he paid for it with his life. His efforts to curtail Hezbollah’s military presence created tensions with both Damascus and Tehran. When the massive bomb detonated in Beirut on that cold February Monday, many were already convinced that his assassination was tied to his attempts to disarm the Lebanese militia and steer Lebanon away from Syrian and Iranian influence. Four years after his assassination, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon was established to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the attack. Under United Nations authority, the court applied Lebanese criminal law and had primacy over the country’s judiciary. In 2022, it sentenced two Hezbollah members in absentia to life imprisonment for the bombing that killed Hariri and 21 others, though the group has refused to hand them over. In the immediate aftermath of the assassination, thousands took to the streets in grief. Since the civil war, Syrian troops under the Assad family had occupied Lebanon. Hariri’s killing triggered a political crisis, sparking mass anti-Syrian protests and mounting international pressure. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Cedar Revolution had begun. 'Twenty years ago, in this square, you demanded justice, and by your own will, you expelled the criminal regime of Bashar Assad from Lebanon,' said Saad Hariri, Rafic’s son and twice Lebanon’s prime minister, speaking Friday from the stage in Martyrs’ Square. On March 8, 2005, pro-Syrian parties — most notably Hezbollah and Amal — responded with a mass demonstration in downtown Beirut against the Cedar Revolution. Christian leader Michel Aoun’s Free Patriotic Movement joined them, forming the March 8 Alliance. Six days later, a counterprotest of nearly a million people demanded 'Freedom, Sovereignty, Independence.' This alliance, which included the Maronite Phalangist (Kataib) Party, the Lebanese Forces, Walid Jumblatt’s Druze Progressive Socialist Party, and the Future Movement — then led by Saad Hariri —became known as the March 14 Movement. Despite the withdrawal of Syrian troops after 29 years of occupation, a new era of Hezbollah dominance and Iranian influence began. 'There was nothing; no one could breathe,' said Lilian. Now, after two months of brutal war between Israeli forces and Hezbollah — during which nearly 4,000 people have been killed in Lebanon — the country has changed dramatically. Hezbollah has been significantly weakened, and Lebanon has a new government and a new president. 'If we continue on this path, God willing, we are going to a better place, and Lebanon will return to being the Switzerland of the East,' said Omar Saadi, a 22-year-old from Beirut. 'We will stay away from these wars and get rid of the sectarian problems, especially us as Sunni people, so we will be part of the state again and can rebuild this country,' he said. In recent years, Lebanon’s Sunni community has seen its political influence wane. The Future Movement abstained from the 2022 legislative elections, and Saad Hariri retired from politics shortly before, relocating abroad. 'Just as you have been by my side for 20 years, I, in turn, will remain by your side and will not leave you,' Saad Hariri told thousands of Future Movement supporters in his speech. A new Lebanon, indeed.

BBC apologizes for airing film featuring senior Hamas official’s ...	The film 'Gaza: How to Survive in a War Zone' depicts the lives of four boys in Gaza during the war with Israel - but it failed to disclose to viewers that one of the film’s protagonists was the son of a senior Hamas official, 13-year-old Abdullah al-Yazouri Three days after airing a documentary about the lives of children and teenagers in Gaza, the BBC has apologized, admitting it was unaware that one of the film’s protagonists is the son of a senior Hamas official and failed to disclose this to viewers. The teenager, identified as Abdullah al-Yazouri, was named by independent journalist David Collier, who shared his findings on X. According to Collier, al-Yazouri also appeared in a Channel 4 News report last November under the name Abdullah Abu Shamala. Collier revealed that 14-year-old Abdullah, who narrates the documentary in his own voice, is the son of Ayman al-Yazouri, a high-ranking Hamas official currently serving as the group’s agriculture minister which was not mentioned in the BBC’s documentary 'Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone.' The film, directed by Jamie Roberts and Yusuf Hammash, aired Monday on BBC Two. It follows the lives of four young Gazans during the ongoing war with Israel. The directors were not present in Gaza during filming; instead, they coordinated remotely with local Palestinian videographers and crew members. In a statement issued, the BBC said that since the documentary aired three days ago, it had 'become aware of the family connections of the film’s narrator, a child called Abdullah.'

For future broadcasts and availability on iPlayer, the film will now clarify: 'The narrator of this film is 13-year-old Abdullah. His father has worked as a deputy agriculture minister for the Hamas-run government in Gaza. The production team had full editorial control of filming with Abdullah.' The statement has been added to the BBC’s Corrections and Clarifications page, and the broadcaster said it will also issue a direct response to the letter. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1vm3kncyl	2025-02-20T02:27:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/20/BJbp1KP4ckx/BJbp1KP4ckx_435_232_1721_968_0_small.jpg

The Kremlin said on Thursday that any plan to send European troops to Ukraine as part of a potential peacekeeping mission would be unacceptable for Russia and that it was monitoring such proposals with concern. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said he is 'ready and willing' to put UK troops on the ground in Ukraine, with U.S. backing, as a security guarantee in the event of some sort of a cease-fire deal between Moscow and Kyiv. Starmer is planning to present a plan to U.S. President Donald Trump to send fewer than 30,000 European servicemen to Ukraine in exchange for American protection of the troops, the Telegraph newspaper reported. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the reported proposal was unacceptable because it would involve forces from a NATO member state and therefore have ramifications for Russia's own security.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkke0knc1g	2025-02-20T02:13:19-08:00

Israelis line streets to honor dead hostages as they return home:...	It is a show of solidarity on one the war's most difficult days since Hamas attack on October 7; 'There’s a lot of sorrow and anger because we wanted to see them alive' Dozens of residents of Kibbutz Nir Oz gathered Thursday ahead of the return of four deceased hostages: kibbutz members Oded Lifshitz, Shiri Bibas, and her children Kfir and Ariel. The residents wore stickers of broken hearts and stood for a moment of silence. 'There’s a lot of sorrow and anger because we wanted to see them alive — we could have seen them alive,' said Ilai, a kibbutz resident. 'We can’t be certain they’re identified and the family confirms it. The disregard for the families' dignity must stop. It's a sad day — and even today, there are still hostages in hell.' Renana Yaakov, whose sons Or and Yigal were freed in the first hostage deal, added, 'People need to be reminded that, at every moment, there are people rotting in tunnels in Gaza. We know what the tunnel looks like, entire lives have passed while they're stuck there. One of my children was there and the thought that others still are doesn’t let me rest.' She expressed anger at the 'abandonment — that it took over 500 days to bring them back, and they returned in coffins. It could have been different. It’s sad, frustrating, infuriating. But at the same time, there's relief, acceptance, even hope — because when deceased hostages are returned, it means we can bring back others so they can be laid to rest.' Emily Damari, who was freed after 471 days in Hamas captivity, posted an image in solidarity with the Bibas family. Inbal and Itay Zeidenberg, also from Kibbutz Nir Oz, described the day as a 'difficult, heartbreaking, and shattering day that highlights the scale of the abandonment. There’s always hope, and many hostages still need to return. There are also deceased hostages held there and we're anxiously waiting for them.' 'We have hope because so many people in this country stand with us and agree that human dignity, life, mutual responsibility and the state's duty to its citizens are what truly matter.' Itay added, 'Being part of this community means being prepared for devastating news every day, every minute.'

One of them, Nitai Faust from Tze'elim, said:'Everyone is connected here. Families are connected, friends are the same. We studied at the same schools. And Yarden (Bibas) is from Tze'elim.' 'The government ministers aren’t here at all,' Faust added. 'So it's important for us to show that we're here with the hostages, both the living and the dead. It’s clear that we need to recognize the victims of this atrocity. They're part of us. We are them.' Neta Geva from Ein HaBesor and Sarit Kani from Kibbutz Magen stressed:'There’s no choice but to stand here. Oded was a friend. It’s natural for us to come and say we’re sorry. We feel we didn’t scream enough, didn’t do enough. This area is like one big family. Everyone knows everyone. Everyone is together and the absence is enormous. The anger is great — the neglect continues because not everyone is coming home by the end of this week.' Michal Bilia, whose brother-in-law Ariel Bilia was murdered on October 7 while defending his family in Ofakim, also came out to the streets. 'It was clear to us that we needed to come and escort the deceased with dignity,' she said. 'We wanted to show the families that we're with them in their hardest moments, and in some way, to show Hamas that against their ridiculous and cynical displays, we stand here with pride, with Israeli flags, proving that we're the complete opposite — that we honor our dead and don’t give up on anyone.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj6jd0045yg	2025-02-20T01:17:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/20/rkz6dZPEc1x/rkz6dZPEc1x_0_282_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Meet the Israeli robotic system set to transform warfare	Developed by Plasan in Israel’s north, the ATeMM robotic system is redefining battlefield mobility, reducing risks for soldiers and increasing operational efficiency A new electric robotic system could transform the battlefield in the coming decades—at least, that’s what its creators believe. Israel-based defense company Plasan recently introduced the All-Terrain Electric Mission Module (ATeMM), a cutting-edge system designed to enhance military mobility and efficiency. The system supports a wide range of battlefield applications, including logistics, energy, munitions and sensors. For over a decade, modern warfare has become increasingly automated and precise, relying less on human soldiers in some cases. The past 16 months of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) operations in Gaza, Lebanon, and other fronts have highlighted this shift, with drones dominating the skies and AI-powered combat systems playing a growing role. Plasan, however, sees the future of military technology in integrated, multidisciplinary systems like the ATeMM. 'This is basically an electric driveline with two wheels that is connected to a leading vehicle—connected in such a way that it becomes part of the vehicle drive itself,' explained Duby Cohen, vice president of Integrated Systems for Plasan, who gave The Media Line a tour of Plasan’s Galilee factory earlier this month. Traditional trailers struggle with battlefield mobility, making them difficult to maneuver. In contrast, the ATeMM offers far greater agility. 'This platform drives itself, connected to the computer of the vehicle, so it actually does what the vehicle does. So, if the driver turns the wheels of the vehicle, then the wheel of the ATeMM goes the same way,' Cohen said. 'When you are doing reverse again, it’s doing the same, so it’s not like doing a reverse with a trailer. It’s like doing a reverse with a six-by-six vehicle.' By integrating ATeMM with a lead vehicle, military units can significantly reduce the number of trucks and drivers required for a mission. A 4×4 can instantly transform into a 6×6 or even an 8×8, increasing payload capacity while maintaining maneuverability. 'Today, if I have six vehicles working in my battalion, I need six vehicles, six drivers, with a total payload of 10 tons,' explained Gilad Ariav, Plasan’s vice president of marketing and business development. 'But if I attach two tandems, I can reduce that by 50%—from six to three vehicles—and still carry the same load. 'We want to decrease the number of drivers and vehicles,' he stressed. Beyond reducing manpower, ATeMM can also operate independently. It can be detached from the lead vehicle and remotely controlled in the field, effectively transforming into an autonomous robotic unit. 'Once it’s disconnected from the vehicle, you can change it to a robot,' Ariav explained. 'There is a remote control in the field.' This autonomous capability allows the ATeMM to operate independently for up to 100 kilometers on a single charge—an advantage Ariav claims no competitor currently offers. ATeMM is also a highly adaptable platform that can be equipped for various battlefield needs. 'You can put any kind of system on it,' Ariav said. 'Guns, missile systems, attacking drones.' It can even serve as a mobile docking station for soldiers. 'You just have some kind of huge battery that can charge everything,' he said. 'So, the soldiers, once his battery is empty, it does not stop his mission. He goes to the docking station, puts the battery inside, takes a fully charged one, and continues his mission.' Cohen said that Israel’s Ministry of Defense has already adopted the technology, with four ATeMMs currently in use in combat and more expected to be deployed. The vehicle-robot resembles a massive open trailer with oversized wheels and two black, tentacle-like rods. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ariav added that the vehicles have been able to operate for about two weeks without needing to recharge. When recharging is necessary, it can be done either by driving—though the rate of charging is uncertain—or by using an external power source, which fully recharges the unit in under six hours. Operating under fire What’s striking is that this cutting-edge military technology was developed in Israel’s periphery — on Kibbutz Sasa in northern Galilee. Plasan also operates a subsidiary in nearby Dalton. 'Our slogan is protecting those who protect us,' said Ariav. 'That’s what we do. That’s why we wake up in the morning—to make sure that our soldiers protecting us are being protected.' Plasan’s workforce reflects the diversity of the Galilee, with employees from Jewish, Muslim, and Christian communities. Today, the company’s sales to the Israeli market account for 20-30% of its total revenue, Ariav said. Since its founding in 1985, Plasan has manufactured over 40,000 armored kits for platforms and soldiers in more than 50 countries, including several NATO members. When war broke out on October 7, 2023, the IDF immediately contacted Plasan to acquire all available armored vehicles, Ariav recalled. The military also requested the company to rapidly produce as many armored plates as possible to protect Israeli soldiers. Kibbutz Sasa, located near Israel’s Lebanese border, was evacuated due to the escalating conflict. Meanwhile, about 20% of Plasan’s employees were called up to the reserves. Although the company had the necessary machinery to manufacture armored plates, it had not focused on this type of production for years. Despite these challenges, the factory continued operating, with more than 350 employees reporting to work daily from wherever they had been relocated. The ballistic plate production line ran 24/7, including on Shabbat, producing approximately 35,000 armored plates for IDF soldiers. All this was done while still fulfilling orders for Plasan’s international clients. Ariav takes great pride in Plasan’s work, emphasizing what sets the company apart—above all, its innovative, customer-focused approach. 'If you have a special problem, come to us,' he said. 'We’ll solve it.' One notable example of Plasan’s problem-solving expertise was its work for the U.S. Army during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. As a subcontractor for the Wisconsin-based company Oshkosh, Plasan provided thousands of vehicle protection kits for Oshkosh’s Mine Resistant Ambush Protected All-Terrain Vehicles (M-ATVs). Designed specifically for Afghanistan’s rough terrain, the M-ATV is a highly mobile armored vehicle built to withstand roadside bombs and other threats. Plasan’s armor system was engineered to absorb and deflect blast energy from mines or explosives, reducing the impact on both the soldiers inside and the vehicle’s critical components. This not only increased the troops’ chances of survival but also ensured they could quickly exit the vehicle if needed. Ariav said Plasan developed these armor kits in less than a year—a rapid turnaround that, he believes, ultimately saved thousands of American soldiers’ lives. Made 100% in Israel Ariav explained that one of the biggest challenges in designing armored vehicles is finding the right balance between protection, weight, and cost. Steel provides strong protection but is too heavy, while titanium is lightweight and highly effective but prohibitively expensive. To address this, Plasan has developed proprietary composite materials that he believes offer the best solution. Cohen demonstrated how these composite materials are made inside the factory. The process involves combining steel, ceramic, specialized adhesives, and other elements to create protective armor. These components are mixed, pressed, and shaped into tiles. The shape of each tile—whether hexagonal, circular, triangular, or another form—depends on its intended use. Once formed, the tiles are carefully pressed and assembled into the final protective armor. Despite being smaller than major Israeli defense companies like Elbit Systems, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, and Israel Aerospace Industries, Plasan manages the entire lifecycle of its products—from initial design to final production. The company’s engineering team specializes in ballistic protection, system engineering, composite materials, and automotive technology. 'We know how to design the armor of the vehicle, how to integrate stuff on the vehicle and mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and so on,' Ariav said, adding that Plasan has its own prototyping department and conducts field simulations to test its designs. According to Yaron Roded, marketing director of armored vehicles for Plasan, the company produces around 10 vehicles per week. A crew of three workers assembles each vehicle before passing it along to different teams responsible for interior, exterior, and final assembly. Roded pointed to a vehicle currently used by the IDF to carry specialized mission equipment and proudly noted, 'The quality and level of performance of those vehicles are identical to any European or American vehicles,' yet they are made entirely in Israel. From a pricing standpoint, he explained that Plasan aims to remain competitive, and as demand increases, production costs naturally decrease. Cohen acknowledged that operating in northern Israel poses logistical challenges, particularly when transporting raw materials. However, he believes the location offers a key advantage: 'We are like a family. Everyone lives nearby, everyone knows each other, and we are really taking care of the area’s economic health.' The future of warfare Ariav believes Plasan is 'on the right path,' particularly with the ATeMM. He emphasized that no army wants to unnecessarily endanger its soldiers, and robotic systems are becoming an integral part of modern warfare. 'There is a virus of robots in the field now,' he said, predicting even greater advancements in the coming decade. Yet, despite the increasing use of robotic technology, he has not seen any system that addresses logistical challenges as effectively as Plasan’s ATeMM. 'We don’t see any competitors that attach the robot to a simple vehicle,' Cohen said. 'Each one of them has his own robots,' each designed for a specific task. In contrast, ATeMM offers unmatched flexibility, seamlessly transitioning from one mission to another. 'This is going to be a revolution,' he said.

Residents of Kibbutz Misgav Am share their thoughts on returning home: 'Most people are not feeling safe' Israel’s northern communities have been evacuated since the start of the Gaza war, when Hezbollah began firing rockets at civilian areas. Homes were heavily damaged, acres of farmland were set on fire, and—worst of all—30 Israelis lost their lives due to Hezbollah’s hostilities. Now, the residents of Kibbutz Misgav Am share their thoughts on returning home. 'I'm not feeling safe,' said Ofer Moskovitz Poshko, a displaced citizen of Misgav Am. 'Most people are not feeling safe because nobody knows what will happen. Now, the army has left Lebanon. So people, I think, will wait to see what happens at the border.' He added, 'You can see on the other side, all the Lebanese are coming home. We're not coming home yet.' Another resident, Daniel Malik, shared: 'The ceasefire with Lebanon is not ideal. It doesn't give us the full meaning of peace. And I still have my concerns. But I believe things will not be as they were before. We have our concerns, and we hope the army will be here with a greater presence and much more power.' Despite suffering devastating losses, the community of Misgav Am remains hopeful.

Hostage handover will start with cruel 'ceremony' before 4 bodies...	One of the most difficult days since October 7 has begun: The bodies of Shiri Bibas, her young children Kfir and Ariel, and Oded Lipshitz will be transferred to Israel from the town of Bani Suheila near Khan Younis. Israel said that a 'ceremony' is a violation of the cease-fire agreement The 503 days of hope for a different ending are shattered, as Israel begins of one of the most difficult days since October 7. Four killed hostages - who according to Hamas are Shiri Bibas, her young children Kfir and Ariel , and Oded Lipshitz - will be handed over to Israel Thursday morning, as part of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. Israel confirmed the names of the hostages Wednesday evening. At the request of the families, Ynet will not publish the harsh photos of the stage and the expected cynical 'ceremony' that Hamas is planning in Bani Suheila, a suburb of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. On the stage at the ceremony, pictures of the four are displayed, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu depicted as a bloodthirsty vampire above them. The horrific caption alongside it, which also includes many errors in Hebrew, reads: 'The war criminal murdered them, with the missiles of fighter jets.' Alongside it, against a background of pictures of coffins covered with Israeli flags: 'Return to war - return of the hostages in coffins.' The Red Cross, to which the dead hostages will be transferred, will hand over the bodies to the IDF inside the Gaza Strip. Upon receiving the fallen hostages, they will be transferred to coffins covered with Israeli flags. At the handover ceremony, there will be a military rabbi who will read Psalms and and the El Moleh Rachamim prayer for the dead. From the Gaza Strip, the coffins will be transported in military vehicles directly to the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Abu Kabir for identification. An Israeli official referred to the intention to perform a 'ceremony' and said that it would be a violation of the agreements between Israel and the mediators, under which Israel insisted that there would be no ceremonies and showpieces. 'We talked about handing over the bodies in a dignified and appropriate manner. We made it clear that we do not agree to ceremonies and that the handover will be carried out in a dignified manner, and this is coordinated between us, the Red Cross and the mediators,' the official said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF spokesman will document the arrival status of the coffins, and the distribution of the photos will be the responsibility of the families of the fallen. As part of a secret annex to the agreement, the killed hostages will be transferred to Israel Thursday instead of on Saturday, the official day of the next round of returning hostages, because the process of identifying them can take up to 48 hours. This will ensure that Hamas complies with the agreement and handed over the dead Israelis. Only after there is official identification will Israel be able to confirm that the terrorist organization did indeed comply with the agreement, and only then will the security prisoners be released. On Saturday, the last six living hostages set to be returned in Phase I will be released - Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen, Tal Shoham, Avraham Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed - and next week four additional hostages will be handed over. To meet the deadlines, the remaining hostages will also be handed over next week on Thursday, the 40th day of the deal. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjfjsnv9kg	2025-02-19T20:36:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/S161Tj75kx/S161Tj75kx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Trump warns Zelensky to quickly negotiate war's end with Russia o...	President Donald Trump on Wednesday warned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he 'better move fast' to negotiate an end to Russia's invasion of Ukraine or risk not having a nation to lead. The rhetoric from Trump toward Ukraine comes amid an escalating back-and-forth between the two presidents and rising tensions between Washington and much of Europe over Trump's approach to settling the biggest conflict on the continent since World War II. Trump's harsh words for Zelensky drew criticism from Democrats and even some Republicans in the United States, where Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression has had bipartisan support. Zelensky said Trump was falling into a Russian disinformation trap - and was quickly admonished by Vice President JD Vance about the perils of publicly criticizing the new president. Trump, who is trying to bring the fighting to a close on terms that Kyiv says are too favorable to Moscow, used an extended social media post on his Truth Social platform to lash out at Zelensky and call the Ukrainian a' dictator without elections.' Due to the war, Ukraine did delay elections that were scheduled for April 2024.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1swrn45kx	2025-02-19T19:54:51-08:00

Yemeni minister calls for arrest of Houthi officials attending He...	Yemeni Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani called on Wednesday for the arrest of a group of leaders from Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis who he said will attend Lebanese Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah's funeral in Beirut. Nasrallah, who had served as Hezbollah's secretary general for more than 30 years, was killed on September 27 as Israel ramped up its attacks on southern Lebanon. His funeral is scheduled for February 23. Eryani demanded that the Lebanese government arrest the Houthi leaders and hand them over to the rival internationally recognized government in a post on X. He did not name the Houthi officials. The Houthis did not officially announce a delegation was attending the funeral, but the Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported a delegation from Yemen would participate.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skkp9cqckl	2025-02-19T13:26:38-08:00	
Freed hostage Agam Berger talks about her religious observance - ...	The IDF lookout freed in the third round of hostage releases under the current deal shared her captivity ordeal: 'The terrorists said, 'Take it.' We used it a lot; it gave us strength,' she said of the prayer book she received; she also recalled tracking Jewish holidays: 'We fasted on Yom Kippur' Agam Berger, who was released two weeks ago as part of the third round of the current hostage deal, recently met with Rebbetzin Tzili Schneider, chair of Kesher Yehudi, and journalist Shneor Webber. During their conversation, she shared chilling details of her captivity in Gaza, the challenges of maintaining her faith, and the unwavering belief that sustained her through unimaginable hardship. Berger revealed that, nearly a year ago, the hostages were surprised when Hamas terrorists provided them with various items, including a Jewish prayer book, or siddur. 'We have no idea how it happened, but they simply handed us prayer books,' Berger recalled. 'They showed them to us and said, ‘Take them.’ We used them constantly. It gave us strength.' The siddur was not the only item found. Berger said that the captors also discovered personal belongings of Israeli soldiers, such as military dog tags. However, she found the delivery of the prayer book particularly unusual. 'It wasn’t random,' she said with certainty. 'It arrived exactly when we needed it most.' Holding onto faith in the darkest times Despite the dire conditions, the hostages made efforts to track the Hebrew calendar and observe Jewish holidays to the best of their ability. 'We roughly knew the dates from the radio and sometimes from segments shown on television,' Berger said. 'That helped us understand when the holidays were approaching.' However, not all holidays could be observed. 'We missed Hanukkah, but during Passover, I managed to avoid eating leavened bread,' she recalled. 'I used corn flour because that’s what was available. The captors didn’t really care about it.' She noted that while the captors harbored deep hatred toward Jews, they showed a level of respect toward religious individuals. 'They hate Jews, but to them, it’s better to be religious than to have no faith at all.' One of the most significant moments of her captivity was Yom Kippur. 'We managed to fast, and I remember praying a lot that day,' she said. 'I also fasted on the Fast of Esther. It was something I felt I had to do, especially given our circumstances.' Uncertainty and separation For most of her captivity, Berger was held alongside fellow hostage Liri Albag and, at times, with other women. 'There were moments when we were together, and it was easier. But then they separated us,' she said. The day before Albag was released was especially difficult. 'They told her on a Friday that she was going to record a video in the middle of the day, but they didn’t tell me she was being sent home,' Berger said. 'For two days, I had no idea.' When she was finally informed of her own impending release, Berger asked about the others. 'They told me, ‘Your friends are already home,’' she recalled. 'It was an overwhelming moment. I knew I was going to be freed, but I wasn’t certain until the very last second.' In the final days of her captivity, Berger and another hostage, Arbel Yehoud, were among the last remaining women. 'By that point, we understood that Shiri Bibas was in a different situation. We didn’t know her exact condition, but we knew she had to be released first.' Looking back, Berger expressed deep gratitude for those who supported her throughout her ordeal. 'I don’t know how I would have survived without my faith,' she said. 'In the end, that’s what gave me hope.' Schneider, who accompanied Berger’s family throughout the ordeal, described meeting her as a profound and moving experience. 'It was an incredible honor to hear firsthand about Agam’s unwavering dedication to her faith under such impossible conditions,' Schneider said. 'She sanctified God’s name in public and inspired the entire Jewish people.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjz36tmcje	2025-02-19T13:17:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/ByVnuo791l/ByVnuo791l_0_180_961_540_0_small.jpg

The source said that ''This was a grave mistake on the part of the IDF liaison officers communicating with the Bibas family, which resulted from an unfortunate human error.' According to him, 'the officers approved publishing the names to reporters, even though no confirmation had been received from the family.

As the news broke, host Chris Kenny struggled to hold back tears, saying: 'If you need clarification of Hamas' sheer brutality, today’s announcement makes it painfully clear'; He added that: 'These cowardly murderers deserve no mercy. Hamas must be eliminated' Sky News host Chris Kenny fought back tears while reading an announcement that Hamas will return the bodies of four hostages, including members of the Bibas family. 'If you need any clarification about the horrors of the Middle East conflict and the sheer brutality of Hamas and its supporters, today’s announcement makes it painfully clear,' Kenny said. 'Hamas has announced it will return the bodies of four hostages, including the two youngest captives. According to the BBC, the group’s negotiator, Khalil Al-Hayya, stated that the bodies include those of Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Kfir and Ariel, who were just 9 months and 4 years old when Hamas kidnapped them during the October 7, 2023, attack.' Kenny struggled to speak through the tears as he talked about the dead children. 'The return of their bodies confirms the devastating news we had feared since the earliest days of this tragedy. More than 16 months ago, the world saw footage of Hamas terrorists and their supporters abducting Shiri at gunpoint as she clung to her children. They were alive and well when taken. Now, they are dead.' 'While the circumstances of their deaths remain unclear, one fact is undeniable: they would still be alive if Hamas had not kidnapped them. The terrorists used them as human shields, exploiting their innocence in their campaign of slaughter and destruction.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Shiri Bibas, a devoted mother, refused to let go of her boys. Now, she and her children are among Hamas’ many victims. Ask yourself: How often did world leaders, politicians, or activists demand the Bibas family’s release? How often did the media highlight their plight while broadcasting Hamas propaganda?' 'Hamas commits crimes against humanity day after day, for over 500 days, yet some still justify its actions. As a cease-fire takes effect, these terrorists discard their civilian disguises and parade as soldiers, pretending to show goodwill. Just weeks ago, they released Shiri’s husband, Yarden Bibas, while now preparing to return the bodies of his wife and children.' Kenny pointed to the yellow ribbon pin he wore and explained that he wears it to remember the plight of the hostages. 'These cowardly murderers deserve no mercy. Hamas must be eliminated, not negotiated with. Now, they trade the bodies of kidnapped children to secure the release of their own terrorists from Israeli prisons. They can sink no lower.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syhew3xqkl	2025-02-19T12:20:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/B11TzTm9kx/B11TzTm9kx_8_0_1427_803_0_small.jpg

Ceremony with a rabbi in the Gaza Strip, coffins wrapped in the I...	In a first since the outbreak of the war, Hamas will transfer the remains of killed hostages to the Red Cross on Thursday morning, which will pass them to the IDF in Gaza; A ceremony will be held, and families will be notified only after formal identification Israel is bracing for one of the most difficult days since the start of the current hostage deal, as four hostages who were murdered in captivity are set to be returned on Thursday. Security officials are preparing for their dignified repatriation, identification and burial. According to Hamas, the bodies will be handed over to the Red Cross at 8 a.m. From there, they will be transferred to Israeli forces inside Gaza. The military rabbinate will hold a solemn ceremony at the transfer site, where the remains will be placed in caskets draped with Israeli flags. Military personnel and a rabbi will be present before the caskets are transported to Israel for forensic identification. 'Tomorrow will be a very difficult day for the State of Israel. A wrenching day, a day of grief,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. 'We embrace the families, and the heart of the entire nation is torn. My own heart is torn. So is yours. And all of the world's heart should be torn, because this demonstrates who we are dealing with, what we are dealing with — with such monsters,' Netanyahu added. 'We are grieving, we are in pain, but we are also determined to ensure that such a thing never happens again.' The IDF acknowledged the painful reality in a statement: 'The military did not succeed in bringing them home alive, but we will ensure they receive a proper burial.' Some identifications may be completed quickly at the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute, while others could take up to 48 hours. Military rabbis urged patience and cautioned against the spread of rumors. A formal notification will be delivered to each family only after official identification, and not based on Hamas' statements. Military officials anticipate that Hamas will claim the hostages were killed in Israeli airstrikes, but stress that the exact cause of death will only be determined following a thorough examination. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to Jewish law, families who had previously observed the seven-day mourning period (shiva) without burying their loved ones will mark a single day of mourning after the burial. Those whose loved one’s death was not officially confirmed until now will begin the full seven-day mourning period. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum issued a statement ahead of the transfer: 'This is a heartbreaking moment as four hostages who were taken alive return to us in death. We will gather in Hostages Square from the morning, standing shoulder to shoulder with the families, bearing this grief together. We say clearly: Time has run out for those still held captive. They must be returned immediately—survivors for rehabilitation, and the fallen for a proper burial.'

The end of Oded Lifshitz's life was 'tragic,' his son says: 'He l...	Yizhar Lifshitz, Oded's son, who received the news that his father was one of the dead hostages who will be repatriated Thursday, tells Ynet: 'The feelings are difficult. I would prefer to know that he was murdered on October 7th and not that he had to go through all the suffering and torture' Yizhar Lifshitz, son of Oded Lifshitz, said Wednesday evening that the family members first learned Wednesday afternoon from the terrorist organizations in Gaza that their father would be included in the release of the four killed hostages on Thursday morning. With the families' approval, Israel later announced that the hostages who would be returned were Shiri Bibas and her children, Kfir and Ariel, and Oded Lifshitz. 'Until he is identified, nothing will be determined, but we are prepared for it to happen tomorrow,' he told Ynet. Even before Israel's announcement of receiving the list, Yitzhar Lipshitz said, 'We saw a statement from Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Everything shows that it's going to happen tomorrow, but until they actually pass the body over, and until we know that they didn't make some mistake then we will get the answer and that's it. We have known for a long time that there is fear for his life.' 'The feelings are difficult,' Yitzhar described. 'The feeling is that he left alive, was kidnapped alive, and returned dead. The kibbutz is burned, the community is slaughtered, so what feelings can there be? Not simple feelings.' He spoke of the many hostages from the kibbutz who were murdered in captivity, including Haim Perry, Alex Danzig and Yoram Metzger. 'We miss them. Members of Kibbutz Nir Oz who were murdered in the tunnels and were returned. There are five of them. That's part of the tragedy here, but it's closing a circle.' He said he wanted to join the celebrations of the families of the hostages who will return on Saturday, but right now 'there is no appropriate time for such things, and it will come. We will deal with it.' As the son of your father Oded, how do you feel? 'I feel like an orphan. The story of the kidnappings is one of the most difficult, because there is no orderly separation from the kidnapped. We know that my father lived in an apartment for at least two or three weeks after he was kidnapped. He was wounded, in pain, bruised from the beatings and with gunshot wounds in his hand – alone, miserable, in some apartment in Khan Younis, without knowing what happened to his friends from the kibbutz or to my mother.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Yizhar Lipshitz said there was evidence that his father was looking for her, and asked if anyone knew what happened to her. 'But my mother was kidnapped straight into the tunnels, and he was kidnapped later to another place. He tried to figure out what happened to her - but they had never met since the moment they broke into the protected room.' He added that 'as his son, I would have preferred to know that he was murdered on October 7th outside his home in Nir Oz rather than that he had to go through all this suffering and torture and be alone and die like a dog there in Gaza. It's a sad story, his life ended in a tragic and humiliating, undeserved, despicable way. So did many from the Kibbutz Nir Oz community. His house was burned down, his wife was kidnapped with beatings that he must have seen. Terrible. Without the family, without children, without closure.' According to him, this is a tragedy that accompanies many families: 'Hostages who lived their entire lives inside there without us, in terrible distress, and this hole will always remain.' He also spoke about the feeling of loss that accompanies those who have lost a relative: 'When some return alive and some dead, you feel the loss. But I don't compare myself to parents who lost children - my father was 84 years old, he had grandchildren, he lived a full life.' Arrived at Nir Oz in 1956: 'His life's work' Oded was kidnapped from his home on the kibbutz. His wife, Yocheved Lifshitz, was also kidnapped from their home and was released in October 2023 along with Nurit Cooper. Yocheved said that on the morning of the massacre Oded tried to close the door to the protected room but the terrorists shot him in the hand. She was taken by the terrorists on a moped while Oded lay in the doorway of the house, unconscious and bleeding. It later emerged that the kidnappers had dressed Oded in a galabiya and that he had been held captive for 20 days with Hana Katzir, who was also kidnapped and released. Yocheved and Oded Lifshitz established a magnificent and unique cactus garden in Nir Oz. Daniel, their grandson, said: 'My grandfather arrived in Nir Oz in 1956, the kibbutz is his and my grandmother's life's work.' Oded was a former peace activist who transported Palestinian cancer patients from Gaza to receive treatment in hospitals in Israel. The Lifshitz family asked to convey through the Hostages and Missing Families Forum: 'These hours are not easy for us, after we were informed that our beloved Oded is on the list of thedead hostages who will return to Israel tomorrow, after being kidnapped alive from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. For 502 days we hoped and prayed for a different ending, but until we receive absolute certainty, our journey will not end, and even after that we will continue to fight until the last hostage is returned.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk1ln3q5kg	2025-02-19T11:11:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/HJfDkiQc1g/HJfDkiQc1g_0_0_850_1000_0_small.jpg
HIAS, Jewish American group helping refugees, scrambles after Tru...	A Jewish American organization, long supported by the U.S. government to assist those escaping conflict and oppressive regimes, is set to scale back significantly its operations after U.S. President Donald Trump's order to stop refugee admissions and almost all development assistance spending. HIAS President Mark Hetfield described the aftermath of Trump's orders, part of a broader 'America First' realignment of the government, as 'complete chaos,' saying that there had been limited engagement by U.S. officials. Trump's January 20 executive orders paused nearly all foreign aid spending for 90 days, hitting humanitarian groups hard, and indefinitely suspended the intake of refugees. Many faith-based groups like HIAS have for decades relied on U.S. funding to provide lifesaving assistance. HIAS, established in 1903 as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, says it helps some 1.4 million refugees and displaced people annually, including providing meals, mental health services and legal protection. The U.S.-based group assists people around the world and helps resettle several thousand refugees each year, mostly to the United States.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjfw7hmqkx	2025-02-19T10:38:44-08:00	
Egypt announces first discovery of pharaoh's tomb in more than 10...	A joint Egyptian-British mission has identified an ancient tomb near Luxor as that of King Thutmose II, marking the first discovery of a pharaonic royal tomb in more than 100 years, Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said on Tuesday. Located west of the Valley of the Kings, Thutmose II's tomb was the last lost tomb of the kings of Egypt's 18th dynasty, and the first royal tomb discovered since King Tutankhamun's in 1922, the ministry said.Archaeologists were able to identify the tomb due to alabaster vessels found on site and inscribed with the name of King Thutmose II and his wife Queen Hatshepsut, one of a small handful of women to have ruled Egypt. They also found pieces of his funerary furniture, as well as pieces of mortar with blue inscriptions, yellow stars and religious writing, the statement said. However, due to flooding soon after the king's death, the tomb was generally not well preserved, the ministry statement added. There were indications that most of its contents had been moved, and work to recover them was under way, it said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1jaz3791e	2025-02-19T10:36:53-08:00

Hostages Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas are dead, and their bodies w...	Shiri and her red-haired children, who have become one of the most prominent symbols of Hamas' cruelty, were included on the list of the killed hostages who will be handed over by Hamas; Yarden Bibas, their extended family and the entire nation hoped and prayed that they would return alive The entire country was shocked on October 7 by the photo of Shiri Bibas, 32, hugging her two red-haired sons, 9-month-old Kfir and 4-year-old Ariel, as they were surrounded in Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas terrorists who were leading them to captivity in Gaza. All three were declared kidnapped, as was husband and father Yarden Bibas, who was released from captivity on February 1 after 486 days - and the entire country and world hoped for the return of all the family members alive. Now that hope has been dashed with the announcement that the bodies of Shiri and her children will be repatriated on Thursday morning. The Bibas family on Wednesday night issued a clarification after the announcement that their loved ones bodies would be returned saying that 'we should receive the bitter news, if it comes, in the customary way after all identification procedures are completed. We ask that we not eulogize our loved ones until there is confirmation after final identification.' Hamas claimed in late November 2023 that Shiri and her two children were not alive. The terrorist organization did not provide any proof of this, and Israel did not signal at any point that there was an indication of this. Among other things, it was claimed that they were being held by another organization. Hamas later even released a video of Yarden Bibas from captivity, after allegedly being informed of their deaths. The IDF spokesman then responded to the harsh video and the terrorist organization's claims, saying that 'Hamas continues to act in a cruel and inhumane manner. The IDF is examining the reliability of the information.' Following the announcement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assured the family members that the matter was being investigated and that they would be updated on any information on the subject. News sites around the world followed the images of the children who remained captive, as well as the images of the reunion of the kidnapped who returned with their families as part of the first hostage deal less than two months after the Hamas attack. In February 2024, the IDF showed the Bibas family a security camera video showing Shiri and the two children in eastern Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on the day of the kidnapping. The three were recorded in the video while still alive, however, even when the footage was shown to the family, it was not clear what their condition was at that time - 136 days after their kidnapping. IDF spokesman Brigadier General Daniel Hagari revealed the video to the public after receiving the family's consent, and clarified at the time: 'We are very concerned about the condition and well-being of Shiri and the children.' Hagari also revealed that the family members were kidnapped by an organization called 'Lords of the Desert' but clarified: 'Hamas is responsible and holds all the details related to the Bibas family. It is the address for this family.' Earlier this month, Yarden Bibas was released from captivity, as part of the fourth round of first phase of the second hostage deal , along with the hostages Ofer Calderon and Keith Siegel. At the reception point in the Re'im camp, he was reunited with his father Eli and his sister Ofri Bibas-Levi, who hugged and kissed him. About a week later, Yarden issued a statement referring to Shiri and their children Ariel and Kfir: 'Unfortunately, my family has not yet returned to me. They are still there. My light is still there and as long as they are there, everything is dark here.' A few days later, when he was released from Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer, his family said that 'the road to rehabilitation is still long, and it will not be complete until Shiri, Ariel, Kfir and all the hostages return home.' In an interview with Ynet, Yarden's sister, Ofri, shared that his first question after his release was about the fate of his wife and children, and referred to her brother's video released by Hamas: 'Ever since the terrorists told him about Shiri and the children, he has been trying to understand if this is psychological terrorism.' Regarding his acclimatization, she said that 'he is still there, on October 7,' and about his days in captivity, she shared that he 'slept most of the time and woke up for food, if it came.' In an earlier interview with Ynet's 'Headline' podcast, Ofri said that the family planned to move to live in the north of the country within a few months. 'They saw that life on the Gaza border was already affecting them, the anxiety was penetrating them. They didn't want to raise the children under this pressure and started thinking about the north. Since we moved to the moshav in the Golan, we had been sending them photos of houses all the time, but they didn't have time to move.' Kfir was kidnapped from his home when he was only 9 months old. On January 18, 2024, people across the country, and even around the world, marked his first birthday . At the event, which was dubbed 'The Saddest Birthday in the World,' several child stars appeared and dedicated their well-known songs to Kfir and Ariel. 'I went to Google to see what a child is supposed to do from the age of nine months to a year. He is supposed to see many colors, but instead he only sees darkness,' said Yossi Schneider, Shiri's cousin, at the time. ( Photo: Roy Rubinstein, Roy Castro ) Less than a month earlier, hundreds of orange balloons were released at the end of a children's literature ceremony for 2023, dedicated to the Bibas family, and especially to the brothers Kfir and Ariel. The balloons were released at the end of the ceremony, as singer Yuval Dayan finished singing 'Until You Come Back.'

We walk around all day with pain and sadness that is always there, and every now and then it rises and overflows.' Bibas-Levy later wondered: 'What is this reality that we are here and they are there, maybe in an underground tunnel? It's a nightmare and unrealistic and our strength is running out. But who are we in the face of their fight there?' Almost nine months after her family was kidnapped, Ofri gave birth to her third son, Afik. She discovered she was pregnant a few days after October 7, the day the terrorists kidnapped Yardan. 'My baby symbolizes nine months that have passed,' said Bibas Levy at the time, when she participated in the mothers' march for the release of the kidnapped. In a conversation with Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth, she said: 'Throughout my pregnancy, I hoped they would be here by the time it ended and I gave birth. By the eighth month, or a little before, I came to terms with the fact that they probably wouldn't be. After the birth, there was a small hope they might somehow be there for the bris. My mind is never fully where I am; no joy is complete, something is always missing. When I left the delivery room, I wanted to send messages to everyone, but I had nothing to send to the family group because they’re not there. Now it's just me, Dad and Mom.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjukyj7q1g	2025-02-19T10:28:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/06/10/B1eXjc2VBC/B1eXjc2VBC_9_260_760_765_0_small.jpg
Herzog: 'The days ahead will be especially heart-wrenching'	President Isaac Herzog, speaking on Wednesday evening at the Great Synagogue in Rome siad of the announcement of the names of the dead hostages that will be returned on Thursday: 'Yesterday, it became apparent to all of us that the days ahead will be especially heart-wrenching. They will hold both pain, grief, and sorrow—as the bodies of hostages are returned to us tomorrow—but also relief and even hope, as living hostages, our brothers, are freed on Shabbat. But these heart-wrenching and overwhelming days also highlight two absolute truths. The first: it is our highest duty to bring every last one of our hostage brothers home. Every moment that they are in the hands of the terrorist monsters is a direct threat to their lives. We must use every means and every measure to bring them home urgently. Every single one of them. The second is the understanding that we really are dealing with absolute and cruel evil. Evil that murders, tortures, and kidnaps mothers and babies, motivated by a murderous jihadist ideology. Evil that butchers whole families. Evil that is continuing its crimes against humanity at these very moments.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hye11qi7ckg	2025-02-19T10:00:57-08:00

Oded Lifshitz's family issued a statement Wednesday night saying, 'These are not easy times for us, after we were informed that our beloved Oded is on the list of deceased hostages who will return to Israel tomorrow, after being kidnapped alive from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz.' It also said, 'For 502 days we hoped and prayed for a different ending, but until we receive absolute certainty, our journey will not end, and even after that we will continue to fight until the last hostage is returned.

The heart of an entire country is breaking: Bodies of Kfir, Ariel...	Israel confirms the names of the dead hostages whose bodies will be repatriated on Thursday morning; The entire country was shocked on October 7 by the photo of Shiri Bibas, 32, hugging her two red-haired sons, 9-month-old Kfir and 4-year-old Ariel, as they were surrounded in Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas terrorists who were leading them to captivity in Gaza. All three were declared kidnapped, as was the father, Yarden , who was released from captivity after 486 days - and the entire public hoped for the return of all the family members alive. Now that hope has been dashed - with the announcement that their bodies will be handed over by Hamas on Thursday morning. The body of Oded Lifshiz, 84, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, also will be repatriated. Hamas claimed in late November 2023 that Shiri and her two children were dead. The terrorist organization has not provided any proof of this, and Israel has not signaled at any point that there is any real indication of this. In addition it has been claimed that they were being held by another organization. Hamas later even released a video of Yarden Bibas, while still in captivity , after allegedly being informed of their deaths. News sites around the world followed the images of the children who remained captive, as well as the images of the reunion of the kidnapped who returned with their families as part of the first hostage deal. Yizhar Lifshitz, son of Oded Lifshitz, told Ynet on Wednesday evening that the family members were informed in the afternoon by the terrorist organizations that their father would be included in the release of the four kidnapped victims. 'Until he is identified, nothing will be decided, but we are prepared for it to happen tomorrow,' he told Ynet. 'The feelings are difficult. He left alive, was kidnapped alive, and returned dead. The kibbutz was burned, the community was slaughtered, what feelings can there be? Not simple feelings,' Yitzhar said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1zwpqxcjl	2025-02-19T09:23:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/S1AaCc7qyl/S1AaCc7qyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

The Red Cross on Wednesday called for privacy and dignity ahead of the expected release of hostages' bodies from Gaza under the terms of a cease-fire. Thursday's handover is expected to include for the first time the bodies of four hostages. 'We must be clear: any degrading treatment during release operations is unacceptable,' the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a statement. The Hamas-directed hostage releases since the January 19 cease-fire have been characterised by large public ceremonies among Gaza's ruins and have come under growing criticism, including from the United Nations, which denounced the 'parading of hostages.' T he ICRC, a neutral intermediary responsible for releasing hostages and Palestinian prisoners under the terms of the ceasefire, has repeatedly called for improvements.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skfo11qq5kl	2025-02-19T08:16:17-08:00	
Trump administration freezes funding for Palestinian Authority se...	Trump’s aid freeze leaves Palestinian security forces underfunded and struggling to maintain order in the West Bank, especially as wayward factions like the Jenin Brigades lurk in the shadows, vying for influence and control The Trump administration halted funding for the Palestinian Authority's (PA) security forces as part of its efforts to freeze U.S. international aid, according to a report by The Washington Post citing American and Palestinian officials. The funding freeze comes during a challenging and complex period for the Palestinian Authority, which is struggling to maintain its rule in the West Bank while claiming it has the capacity to govern Gaza in the aftermath of the Gaza war. Palestinian Authority and Jenin Brigades clash The Palestinian security forces, characterized by chronic underfunding and a lack of support from many Palestinians, play a critical role in the PA's ability to maintain law and order in the West Bank, even if they are not always successful. The PA, led by the 89-year-old President Mahmoud Abbas, is currently only able to pay partial salaries to its employees, including members of the security forces. During Donald Trump’s first term, the U.S. stopped direct aid to the Palestinian Authority but continued funding training programs for the security forces. These exercises and courses are conducted through the U.S. Security Coordinator’s Office (USSC), which mediates between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Anwar Rajab, a spokesperson for the PA security forces, told The Post that the U.S. is considered 'a major contributor to PA projects,' including training programs for the forces. A former Israeli official, speaking anonymously to the American newspaper, said the USSC 'was not significantly affected' by the aid freeze, as 'other donors stepped in to fill the gap.' However, a Palestinian official, equivalent in rank to a lieutenant colonel, told The Post that the funding freeze has already led to cuts in some training programs. The Palestinian official noted that a planned meeting with the Americans this month, intended to assess the PA’s operation against terrorists in the Jenin refugee camp — which was halted following the Gaza war — was postponed, with no new date set. Washington also halted funding for a virtual shooting range, which the official said the PA needs because Israel does not allow it to import live ammunition for training. Although the project was nearly completed, the official stated that the PA is now seeking alternative funding sources due to the aid freeze. Biden administration’s position Former President Joe Biden has supported the return of the Palestinian Authority to power in Gaza. However, The Post noted that this move is opposed not only by Israel but also by Hamas, which expelled PA officials from Gaza and executed officers from the PA security forces. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1eufom9jl	2025-02-19T07:48:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/22/HJN8D5SrJe/HJN8D5SrJe_1_132_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Austria foils terror plot: 14-year-old ISIS supporter planned Vie...	A 14-year-old Austrian citizen of Turkish descent planned a knife attack at Vienna’s Westbahnhof station, Austrian authorities say Austrian police have arrested a 14-year-old boy suspected of planning a terrorist attack at Vienna’s Westbahnhof train station. According to the Interior Ministry, authorities found knives and extremist materials in his possession, indicating his support for the Islamic State group. The teenager, an Austrian citizen of Turkish descent, was taken into custody on Feb. 10, but authorities only announced his arrest now. The investigation began after officials detected a TikTok user spreading Islamist propaganda across multiple accounts. Police identified the suspect and, during a raid on his home, discovered jihadist literature, a flag with an Islamic oath, and handwritten instructions for making explosives. They also seized several sharp objects, including a knife with a 16.5-centimeter (6.5-inch) blade and a 7-centimeter (2.7-inch) razor. News of his arrest comes just days after a deadly terrorist attack in the Austrian town of Flach, where a Syrian extremist fatally stabbed a 14-year-old boy and wounded five others before sitting by the roadside and smiling for a photo. The attack was Austria’s deadliest since the 2020 Vienna shooting, which left four people dead. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Authorities said the Flach attacker was rapidly radicalized through TikTok videos and had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State before the attack. Just last week, Germany saw a similar Islamist-inspired attack when an Afghan asylum seeker, whose application had been rejected, drove a car into a labor protest in Munich, killing a woman and her 2-year-old daughter. He had a criminal record for drug and theft offenses, and officials later found signs of his radicalization. The recent attacks in Austria and Germany come as far-right parties in both countries experience a surge in support, partly due to their hardline stance on Muslim immigration. Germany is set to hold nationwide elections next week, where the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is expected to make significant gains. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rklkodq9yg	2025-02-19T07:43:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/HkbbsIm5Jl/HkbbsIm5Jl_1_105_1000_563_0_small.jpg

Indian delegation visits Israel: India and Israel can learn from ...	The members of the Sharaka delegation, which included military officials and leading journalists from India, expressed sympathy for Israel’s struggle for security and highlighted the extensive military cooperation between the two countries In recent years, the relationship between India and Israel has transformed from a distant diplomatic connection to a robust partnership marked by significant collaboration in trade, defense and technology. Once limited by political complexities, this evolving bond reflects shared interests in security, innovation and regional stability, signaling a new era of cooperation. Earlier this month, a delegation of leaders from Indian society traveled to Israel to visit important sites and speak to Israeli counterparts, proving that ties between the two nations extend to the personal level as well. The visit was organized by Sharaka, a nonprofit organization that aims to reshape the Middle East according to the values of dialogue and cooperation. Devang Bhatt, head of the major Indian news channel GTPL, aid he was excited when a representative from Sharaka asked him to join the delegation because he recognized the importance of educating younger Indians about the reality in Israel. After this recent visit, his first to Israel, he’s now planning on devoting one show a month on his channel to the situation in Israel. Many of the delegation members described significant parallels between the situations in Israel and in India. For Lt. Gen. Satish Dua, who served in the Indian army for nearly four decades, a pin on his uniform calls to mind those similarities. The pin is shaped like the leaf of a chinar tree, a common species in India’s conflict-ridden Jammu and Kashmir region. 'You know, Jammu and Kashmir, we have a situation nowadays with Pakistan, and we’re dealing with terrorists, as are you,' Dua said. 'So I was the core commander there. That means all the army, all the paramilitary forces there in Kashmir Valley. And the emblem that the formation, the core headquarters, the whole core that is adopted there is a chinar leaf. So that’s why I wear it here proudly.' He said that both Israel and India are dealing with 'difficult neighbors' — in India’s case, Pakistan, which has been a significant source of terrorism. India admires the way Israel has handled both enemy states and nonstate proxy groups, Dua said. 'There’s a lot to learn from the Israel Defense Forces for our forces. And I’m sure there are some lessons that your forces can also take away from our forces, because we also have been in the same, ever since our independence, we’ve had some kind of insurgency or the other,' he said. The Shakara trip was the first visit to Israel for many of the participants, including Lt. Gen. Rajendra Ramrao Nimbhorkar. But as a longtime officer in the Indian military, Nimbhorkar was no stranger to Israel’s military history. 'This being a very militarily dependent country, we in the Indian army have studied various wars and campaigns which the Israeli army has fought,' he said. He recognized 'a lot of similarities between India and Israel,' especially in regard to Jammu and Kashmir, where he served for 17 years. Learning about Israel’s military history is actually part of the military curriculum for India, Dua said. For that reason, 'there is a great deal of awareness, especially among the Indian army officers, about what has been the military history of Israel,' he said. One of the highlights of Dua’s trip was visiting the border with Gaza. 'It was very nice to learn about the Gaza border, because we have similarities in the India-Pakistan border, because the way the terrain is, though our terrain is much higher mountainous terrain, but the similarities of a porous border and terrorists getting across using the sensors,' he said. 'We actually use sensors that we actually procured from Israel. We also use the same in our border fencing.' Those are just a few examples of military cooperation between Israel and India. The Drishti-10 Starliner used by the Indian military, for example, is a variant of an Israeli drone. Bhatt noted that his own news company relies on Israeli systems. 'In each corner of the world, they have to get support from Israel. Even I’m talking about my own company,' he said. 'My company has 10.5 million subscribers and the security system we have got from Israel only.' Dua said that India relies on Israeli weapons to fill any 'critical voids.' As far back as three decades ago, when he was serving as colonel on the border with Pakistan, the first handheld thermal imagers the military had were sourced from Israel, Dua said. 'The best measure of our support and trust in each other is the fact that there have been a couple of times when we needed something very critically, very urgently because of the operational situation. In fact, the conflict was ongoing, and Israel came to our help,' he said. 'You know, sometimes it takes, there are long gestation periods to actually get defense equipment and weapons and ammunition. But when we needed it, we got it in real quick time.' India and Israel’s militaries also carry out regular joint exercises and delegations to each other’s countries, Dua added. 'Both our armies, that is India and Israeli army or armed forces, are involved in combating the same scourge. So there is again a lot of give and take,' he said. 'I’m sure that India and Israel will only enhance their cooperation in the new emerging fields, especially in the world of cyber and space,' Dua continued. 'Here, Israel has a lot of strengths. India also has some strengths in the software skills, but in the cyber world, the Israeli capabilities are fairly unmatched, and we look forward to cooperating in that.' The members of the delegation all expressed that the Indian people have a positive view of Israel. 'Forget about Indian politicians, forget about Indian media, but once we are on the ground, Indians are in favor of Israel,' Bhatt said. Snehesh Alex Philip, a journalist at ThePrint, India’s largest and fastest growing digital news agency, said that one challenge in terms of communicating about Israel is that young Indian news consumers don’t have patience for involved stories. 'It’s like a quick two-minute noodles, right? They want everything in, in just a matter of two minutes,' he said. Philip described the Indian population as supportive of Israel overall. 'As far as the whole issue of Israel, Hamas, and this region is concerned, I think back in India, there’s a huge support as far as Israel is concerned,' he said. Neha Khanna, deputy editor and senior anchor with India’s TV9 network, said that Indians’ experience with terrorism makes the population sympathetic to Israelis’ struggles. 'We had horrific attacks in Mumbai in 2008, for instance, perhaps one of the worst attacks, if not the worst, on Indian soil,' she said. 'And what happened in Israel on October 7 was something like that.' But alongside that sympathy is a sense that the war needs to come to an end, Khanna said. 'I think a lot of people believed that the war had gone on for too long and just too many people had died,' she said. 'A lot of Palestinians have suffered; too many lives have been lost in Gaza. So, you know, one really hopes that calm heads can prevail and that a lasting peace can be found.' 'I have covered this war extensively and brought news about it to my Indian viewers, not just in India, but also abroad. And I have, in fact, had multiple Israeli guests on my shows to talk about various dimensions of the war,' she said. 'And I think we can all agree that it’s been a very challenging situation for Israel, for the Palestinians, and for the Middle East and indeed the entire world, because everybody just kept wondering if this was going to, in fact, degenerate into some sort of a regional conflagration. I’m glad it hasn’t got to that point, and I certainly hope that the cease-fire holds. But I can tell you that pretty much like everyone else, the people of India are watching this situation very closely with a lot of interest.' She noted that India supports a two-state solution, which raises questions about President Donald Trump’s plans to relocate Gazans and support Israeli presence in the West Bank, both of which seem to preclude a two-state solution. 'Indians, as much as anyone else, want to see a return of peace and normalcy in the region. And, at the end of the day, if the people of India believe that we need to see peaceful coexistence and cohabitation between the two peoples, then I guess what is being suggested by President Trump is not really likely to find many supporters, could in fact cause alarm,' she said. Philip, too, highlighted the importance of achieving a two-state solution. 'Without a two-state solution, I don’t see any long-lasting peace that is going to be there. No matter how much you can militarily take over a region, there has to be a conflict resolution. It can’t be a prolonging of conflict,' he said. He did praise Trump for his actions so far, noting that the president applied pressure to both Hamas and to Israel to reach a deal. 'Had Trump not won the elections, had Trump not come in, I don’t think the cease-fire would have really worked out,' he said. Philip also noted the importance of the Abraham Accords, normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab nations signed during Trump’s first term. But he said that Israel’s increasingly normalized place in the Middle East was likely one of the catalysts for the October 7 attacks. Like Khanna, Philip described the conflict between Israel and Hamas as a war fought for a just cause but one that has gone on too long. 'What Hamas did was nothing but a pure form of terrorism. Israel had every right to hit back at Hamas, which it did, but the war prolonged too long,' he said. 'There were a lot of civilian casualties that came up. There was the whole question of the hostages that were there.' Dua described the ongoing hostage crisis as a 'damned if you do, damned if you don’t' situation of a kind with which India is unfortunately familiar. 'We’ve had an aircraft that was hijacked in 1999, taken to Kandahar in Afghanistan, and we were told to release a few dreaded terrorists languishing in our jails, in our prisons,' Dua said. 'One of them, Masood Azhar, eventually formed the Jaish-e-Mohammed, whose signature tactics is suicide squads, and they’ve started perfecting that technology, and they’ve harmed not only India, even Pakistan and other places. So what I’m trying to say is that it’s a tough call that Israel has had to make.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He said that the countries of the world ought to learn from each other about terrorist negotiations, but not necessarily establish hard and fast rules for such negotiation that all will abide by. 'If you formulate a few bigger countries, U.S., India, Israel and other countries who are affected by terrorism, we sit down and formulate some rules. How can we hold a signatory to that? Because the circumstances in which that country will be called upon to negotiate with a particular situation will be different,' he said. 'To my mind, I don’t think it’s going to be an easy thing. A better way would be to learn from each other’s experiences, to form their own national policies, and then act on it.' Nimbhorkar commended Israel for its response to the October 7 attacks. 'Whatever the solution Israel has done, I think is the correct solution,' he said, explaining that Hamas will now think twice about committing more terror attacks. He called on the international community to more harshly condemn Hamas and to support Israel’s response. Relocating Gazans to neighboring countries, as Trump has proposed, 'is desirable, but I think it’s not practical,' Nimbhorkar said, noting that doing such a thing might require a ground invasion into Egypt. 'Personally, I feel Israel should not let go the control of the Gaza Strip,' he said. 'Because the moment you let it go, then again you come back to square one. And therefore, after that, the rest of the thing, as you say, giving a soft touch, subsequently can be done. First, you have to have an iron hand and then have a soft touch.' That duality was also present in the advice Bhatt had to offer to Israel. He said he would like Israelis to internalize the Hindu concept of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which means 'the world is one family.' 'Even Narendra Modi, prime minister, whenever he goes to any country, he delivers the same message, Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,' Bhatt explained But that message must be taken together with another piece of Indian wisdom. 'There is a god, Krishna. He always says, whenever an enemy is there, then please use your weapon,' Bhatt said.

I’m OK, don’t worry, I love you': Nimrod Cohen’s message to his ...	As the first phase of the hostage deal concludes, families of those still in captivity express growing concern over delays in negotiations; Saturday’s upcoming release will include six hostages, leaving 59 hostages behind in Gaza Yehuda Cohen, the father of abducted soldier Nimrod Cohen, said on Wednesday that he received a message from his son through a relative of one of the recently released hostages. 'I’m OK, don’t worry, I love you,' Nimrod conveyed through the freed hostage. Nimrod is not expected to be released during the first stage of the deal. In an interview with Ynet last month, Yehuda shared: 'Over a year ago, we met with two pilots who had been released from captivity in Egyptian and Syrian prisons. They told us that while they were in captivity, they worried about their families worrying about them,' he recounted. 'I believe this is also the case with Nimrod. Nimrod was with two of the hostages who were released in one of the last rounds — it gives us some insight into the conditions in which he is being held. They walked on their own feet, which gives me hope that my son will return to us in the same way. I know him; he’s young and strong. I trust him to hold on and endure.'

In wake of reports that Israel fears a violation of the peace agreement with Egypt, the IDF is investigating whether interested parties are connected to publications intended to sabotage relations between the two countries; In Cairo, there were protests over videos in which an IDF spokesman is seen thanking Sisi in Arabic for assistance in the war in Gaza and Lebanon; Israel says it is a fake The IDF is examining whether regional stakeholders are behind publications intended to sabotage relations and incite tensions between Israel and Egypt , Ynet has learned. Israeli sources are convinced that stakeholders are trying to undermine relations between the countries, and are therefore promoting false information about Egypt's preparations for war with Israel, using influencers. In addition, Ynet has learned that in recent days Israel received a protest from senior Egyptian officials, following several videos distributed on social media, in which an alleged IDF spokesman is seen thanking Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in Arabic for the assistance he is providing to Israel in its war in Gaza and Lebanon. Egyptian officials have appealed to official channels for an explanation. The IDF clarified that these are fake videos produced using AI technologies, and even issued an official denial, calling it 'Suspicious attempts to distribute fake videos through dubious and false accounts. ... Be vigilant and aware of these attempts.' In recent days, additional false videos have been distributed, including some which show military exercises carried out by the Egyptian army in 2017 and 2020, and which were presented as if they were taking place now, as well as photos allegedly taken in Sinai. Tensions between the countries intensified following statements by Israel's ambassador to Washington, Yechiel Leiter, who sharply accused Egypt of 'deliberately violating the peace agreements with Israel,' and even added that it was building military bases in the Sinai, in an address late last month in a meeting with the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. A video of the remarks surfaced earlier this week. Shortly after Leiter's remarks were published, World Jewish Congress President Ron Lauder arrived with extraordinary speed in Cairo for a meeting held at the Presidential Palace. The meeting was attended by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Egyptian Intelligence Chief General Hassan Rashad. According to a statement from the presidential office in Cairo, the conversation focused on Egypt’s efforts to promote regional peace and establish a Palestinian state. Sisi made it clear that he expects 'all parties involved, including Israel, to act with full responsibility to ensure that the cease-fire lasts.' Lauder, for his part, praised Sisi for his 'responsible leadership.' Although Leiter's remarks were deleted from the Internet, they were published by American and Israeli media outlets, which emphasized that this was the first time that a senior Israeli official had accused Egypt of such a blatant violation of the peace agreements. Since October 7, 2023, the IDF has been more vigilant about regional threats. The Southern Command is taking a more cautious and suspicious approach to any potential threat, and the Intelligence Directorate is working to improve its control and analysis mechanisms.

They believe that the purpose of spreading the rumors may be to increase fear and panic among the Israeli public, which has already been traumatized since the October 7 massacre. 'From our investigations, these rumors did not originate from the Egyptian side. When Cairo wants to convey messages, they know how to do it well,' an Israeli official said. The official added that the IDF’s main concern is not the border with Egypt, but rather the eastern border with Jordan, given Iran’s efforts to destabilize Amman and strengthen Palestinian elements in the country. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s11rnwm9je	2025-02-19T05:32:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/Hkza4JP75Jg/Hkza4JP75Jg_0_708_1080_608_0_small.jpg

'Two weeks ago, the prime minister set the goal of securing the release of the remaining living hostages from the first phase in a single wave.

Suez Canal Authority Chairman Osama Rabie said on Wednesday that the Red Sea crisis did not create a sustainable route to replace the canal, adding that there were positive indicators for the return of stability in the region. Iran-backed Houthi militants have attacked vessels in the Red Sea area since November 2023, disrupting global shipping lanes by forcing vessels to avoid the nearby Suez Canal and reroute trade around Africa, raising the costs for insurers. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said in December the disruption cost Egypt around $7 billion in revenue from the Suez Canal in 2024. That's a drop of more than 60% from its revenue a year before from the canal, Sisi said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy1ochxc1x	2025-02-19T03:28:38-08:00

The Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar reported that the strike was carried out by an Israeli drone in the village of Aita al-Shaab. The vehicle targeted was carrying a suspected Hezbollah operative, marking the first such strike since the Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon while maintaining a presence at five military outposts near the border fence. Later, reports from Lebanon identified the victim as Mohammad Sarour, the son of the mayor of Aita al-Shaab, who was targeted outside his home. On Tuesday, the IDF completed the withdrawal of its forces from the area where it had remained for the past two and a half months—during the implementation of the cease-fire that officially took effect following the pullback between Israel and Hezbollah.

Pro-Palestinians clash with Jewish residents in Brooklyn's Boroug...	Palestinian activist Pal-Awda organizes protest yelling Zionists go to hell'; break police lines in violent confrontation; Local congressment says it was a 'deliberate harassment of one of the largest Orthodox communities in the U.S' Tensions escalated in Brooklyn's Borough Park on Tuesday night as an anti-Israel protest turned into a heated confrontation with local Jewish residents, leading to at least one arrest. The demonstration, organized by the activist group Pal-Awda, was aimed at a real estate event that protesters claimed was involved in selling Palestinian land to Israel. Dozens of protesters gathered in a designated area set up by police, while across the street, dozens of local residents and pro-Israel activists held Israeli flags and responded with counter-chants. Clashes broke out after some protesters crossed police barriers and approached the Jewish and pro-Israel group, leading to pushing, shouting, and physical confrontations. NYPD officers intervened, arresting at least one demonstrator. Videos from the scene showed protesters chanting 'Zionists go to hell' and 'settlers go back home,' with some raising their hands in a triangular gesture associated with Hamas. Counter-protesters shouted back 'terrorists' and 'Nazis go home.' The demonstration, which lasted over an hour in freezing temperatures, eventually dispersed as police maintained a heavy presence. Some protesters continued shouting slogans as they walked toward a nearby subway station, while local residents observed from the sidewalks. Pro-Israeli New York lawmakers swiftly condemned the protest. Congressman Ritchie Torres wrote on X: 'The pro-Hamas mob that vowed to ‘flood’ Borough Park quickly descended into violence. Violence is not a bug of the ‘Free Palestine’ movement—it is a feature.'

Since Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, New York has seen hundreds of anti-Israel protests, but demonstrations specifically targeting Orthodox Jewish communities have been rare.

Senior official accuses Mossad, Shin Bet chiefs for 'only made co...	The unamed official claimed that the change in the negotiating team removing security chiefs and replacing them with allied minister directly resulted in the planned release of six hostages on Saturday A senior Israeli official on Wednesday praised Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to sideline Mossad director David Barnea and Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar from the hostage negotiation team, claiming it directly contributed to the expedited release of six hostages on Saturday. The official said that the successful agreement to free all live hostges named in the first phase of the cease-fire deal, along with the planned return of the bodies of fallen hostages on Thursday—which had already been scheduled as part of the agreement—was a result of Netanyahu’s decision to restructure the team. The new negotiation team is led by Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a close confidant of Netanyahu. 'The new team changed the dynamics and led a true negotiation instead of simply making concessions,' the official said. 'They also ended the practice of biased, regular briefings against the prime minister and political leadership, which only encouraged Hamas to harden its stance and raise its demands.' Netanyahu had previously criticized the security chiefs and their team in private discussions, accusing them of mishandling the talks. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Netanyahu appointed Dermer to lead negotiations for the second phase of the hostage deal, working alongside Steve Witkoff, special envoy for Middle East affairs under U.S. President Donald Trump. Until now, negotiations had been led by Bar and Barnea. While Barnea will remain involved, the new team also includes Gal Hirsch, Israel’s coordinator for hostage and missing persons affairs, and a former deputy Shin Bet chief, identified only as 'M.' Opposition Leader Lapid: 'A Cowardly and Completely False Statement' Opposition leader Yair Lapid criticized the Prime Minister’s Office following the senior official’s remarks. 'This statement raises serious concerns about Netanyahu’s judgment,' Lapid said. 'It is cowardly and a complete lie. Netanyahu keeps blaming others for his failures and is exploiting the hostage families for political gain,' Lapid said. 'Anyone working for him should know that, sooner or later, they will be publicly sacrificed for half a headline. This is a matter of life and death, yet he is focused on claiming credit. He should stop hiding behind anonymous briefings and focus on bringing all the hostages home.' Following Tuesday’s announcement that six hostages—Omer Ankret, Omer Shem Tov, Tal Shahem, Elia Cohen, Avera Mengistu, and Hisham al-Sayed—would be released on Saturday, an Israeli official described it as 'a significant achievement for Netanyahu, carried out in full coordination with the United States.' The official added: 'The prime minister once again succeeded in expediting the release process, securing an agreement to bring back all the living hostages from the first phase this week, along with the return of the bodies of fallen hostages. If this agreement is implemented, Israel will have completed Phase A of the deal—an achievement that few believed possible.' Preparations for the Second Phase The official noted that as part of the negotiations, Israel had approved the entry of 'a very limited quantity' of mobile shelters and heavy equipment into Gaza. 'This does not affect the feasibility of implementing Trump’s voluntary migration plan or creating a new reality in Gaza, which Prime Minister Netanyahu is fully committed to,' the official claimed. Israel is now preparing for negotiations on the second phase of the cease-fire, which, according to the official, 'will focus on the political conditions for ending the war.' Dermer will lead these discussions with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. 'Israel will present its security demands in the negotiations, based on the war objectives set by the security cabinet. If Hamas refuses to comply, Israel will resume military operations in Gaza with full force, backed by the Trump administration, a replenished stockpile of munitions, fresh troops, and an entirely new combat strategy,' the official said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy6uge7cke	2025-02-19T02:47:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/HJPvoQXcJg/HJPvoQXcJg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Military indicts reservists for severe abuse of Nukhba terrorist;...	According to the indictment, the accused - among them two officers - subjected a prisoner to extreme violence, including stabbing him in the buttocks with a sharp object that penetrated near his rectum, resulting in severe injuries Five IDF soldiers in the reserves were indicted on Thursday for aggravated abuse and severe bodily harm against a Palestinian security detainee at the Sde Teiman detention camp. Two of the accused are reserve officers, holding the ranks of lieutenant colonel and captain, while the remaining three are of lower ranks. The lieutenant colonel served as a team commander in 'Force 100.' Initially, there were suspicions of sexual offenses by those involved, but the indictment makes no mention of such allegations. According to the indictment, the accused subjected the detainee to extreme violence, including stabbing him in the buttocks with a sharp object that penetrated near his rectum. The indictment further states that the abuse resulted in severe injuries, including fractured ribs, a punctured lung, and internal rectal tears. The incident occurred on July 5, 2024, while the reservists were serving at the detention facility. They had been instructed to search the detainee, who was handcuffed, shackled, and blindfolded with a cloth when they led him to the search area. 'The investigation gathered extensive evidence, including detailed medical documentation and authentic security camera footage from the detention facility,' the military said in a statement. 'IDF soldiers and commanders operate in accordance with the law and the army’s values, and any exceptional incidents or suspicions of criminal behavior are addressed accordingly.' The indictment says two reservists forced the detainee against a wall, lifted his cuffed hands upward, and pressed them against the surface while the others stood nearby. Moments later, the detainee was seen on the floor, writhing in pain, with the accused standing around him, occasionally bending over him. Over the course of approximately 15 minutes, the reservists allegedly kicked the detainee, stomped on him, stood on his body, shoved him, including with a baton, dragged him across the floor, and used a Taser on him—including on his head. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Additionally, the indictment states that during the attack, the detainee’s blindfold fell off, after which one of the accused stabbed him in the buttocks with a sharp object, causing a rectal tear. Another reservist then ordered the detainee to put a baton in his mouth. The abuse continued throughout and after this assault. According to the indictment, 'Throughout the ordeal, the detainee cried out in pain.' It further states that two of the reservists led the detainee to a mattress in the detention area, where one of them pulled his shirt down over his pants to cover his buttocks. Soon after, the detainee began bleeding from his wounds. About an hour later, he reported difficulty breathing and a headache. Several hours after the attack, detention facility staff noticed significant bleeding on his pants, prompting medics to rush him to the on-site clinic. A doctor then ordered his immediate transfer to a hospital. The military prosecution said that the detainee suffered severe bodily harm, including fractures in seven ribs, a punctured left lung, a rectal tear, and multiple injuries to his body and face. Due to the stabbing, he required emergency surgery, which involved a colostomy (diverting the colon to an external stoma) and the insertion of a chest drain. He also received blood transfusions and was hospitalized under extended medical supervision. After about three and a half months, he underwent another procedure to reverse the colostomy. Defense Attorneys: 'The Blood Libel Has Collapsed' 'The blood libel against these soldiers—accusing them of gang rape and sodomy—has completely collapsed,' Defense attorneys, Avi Amiram and Lior Porat, from the Military Defense Counsel, said. 'This slander, along with malicious leaks and a falsified, ‘doctored’ video, caused immense damage to our client, to all IDF soldiers, and to Israel’s security. Not to mention, it recklessly harmed our hostages held by Hamas terrorists.' Regarding the remaining charges of aggravated abuse and severe bodily harm, they said, 'During the pretrial hearing, we presented compelling arguments refuting these allegations, and we have no doubt that once the facts emerge in court, these charges, too, will be dismissed. The indictment was rushed through just a day after we requested the military prosecution to delay proceedings until the source of the severe leaks was investigated—leaks that could have significantly influenced the investigation and those making decisions in the case.' Attorneys Adi Keidar, Moshe Polsky, and Nati Rom, who represent two of the accused on behalf of the Honenu legal organization, said the indictment marks another disgraceful low for the military prosecution and is a stain on Israel’s judicial system. 'Despite our thorough pretrial hearing proving there was no basis for the outrageous sexual allegations initially made against the defendants, and despite the stark difference between the indictment’s details and the initial accusations of rape and extreme violence that tarnished their reputations, we still believe this indictment should never have been filed. A proper legal system would have rejected this case outright, as the investigation was biased, tainted by leaks, and involved coercing a vile terrorist into filing a complaint against our heroic soldiers.' Attorney Efraim Damari, who represents another defendant called for an independent commission to ivestigate the legal process. 'This is not a case of ‘much ado about nothing’—it’s far worse. The way this indictment was filed requires an immediate independent investigative commission, today—not tomorrow,' he said. 'This commission must examine all those involved in this disgraceful legal process, from the attorney general and state prosecutor to the military advocate general and anyone else connected to this corrupt investigation. Who will compensate Israel, the IDF, and our brave soldiers for this irreparable damage? Who will repair the harm done to national security by the reckless publication of this case as a so-called ‘rape by our heroic soldiers’?' Protests and Political Fallout The arrest of the reservists sparked widespread outrage, leading dozens of protesters—including coalition Knesset members—to storm a military base in southern Israel. Later that day, another unprecedented breach occurred when a large group of demonstrators forced their way into the military court complex in Beit Lid. Outgoing-IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi swiftly condemned the intrusion into the Shde Teiman base and the resulting chaos, calling it 'a severe and illegal act.' He stated: 'This behavior is entirely unacceptable. We are in a time of war, and such actions endanger national security. I fully support the military prosecution and investigative authorities in thoroughly examining every incident that comes to their attention, regardless of rank or role. These investigations safeguard our soldiers at home and abroad while upholding the IDF’s values. They are conducted with full respect for our troops, whom we, as their commanders, are responsible for.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant took several hours to respond to the unrest. 'I have the utmost appreciation for the soldiers carrying out the complex and critical mission of detaining Hamas terrorists—despicable criminals whom we will bring to justice with the harshest measures. The IDF will continue operating within the law, Gallant said. 'We must allow the proper authorities to conduct their investigations while respecting our soldiers. Even in times of anger, the law applies to everyone—we do not storm IDF bases, and we do not break the laws of the State of Israel.' Minutes after Gallant’s statement, the Prime Minister’s Office released a statement condemning the base breach: 'Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calls for immediate calm in Shde Teiman and strongly condemns the intrusion into an IDF base.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryjumq7cje	2025-02-19T01:46:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/11/r111iogaD0/r111iogaD0_0_110_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Israeli Navy’s new missile ships in an expanding battlefield	INS Nitzachon missile ship features stealth technology that reduces radar signature, making it appear lightly armed at first glance while advanced weapjonry such as Iron Dome aerial defense systems is revealed only in launch Thousands of kilometers separate the Israeli Navy’s missile ships, requiring Flotilla 3 Commander Col. A. to simultaneously hold a satellite communication device with one hand while speaking with a patrol crew near Syria with the other. As the Israeli military establishes five new outposts along the Lebanese border, the navy is tightening its grip on Hezbollah from the west, operating with full freedom to surveil, observe, and strike. In recent months, Israeli Navy vessels have played a central role in the military’s enforcement strikes in Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah infrastructure and operatives with precision fire from formidable Sa’ar 6-class corvettes. Weighing 2,000 tons, these are the navy’s largest and most advanced ships. During a special operation in September to destroy an underground missile production site in Masyaf, Syria, the missile boat flotilla played a key role in clearing the way and providing remote cover for Israeli Air Force units. Throughout the sensitive operation, the ships launched attacks deep inside Syria from distances of over 100 kilometers, securing safe passage for Israeli commando forces. Since the October 7 massacre, the Navy’s operational scope has quadrupled. It has intercepted dozens of attempts to target Israel’s offshore gas rigs with drones and missiles launched from Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq. Additionally, it has carried out daily strikes in support of ground forces in Gaza, launched hundreds of attacks against Hezbollah, and even neutralized 15 Syrian naval vessels while crippling military ports in Tartus and Latakia. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: It has also been engaged in countering the Houthi threat from Yemen, an ongoing challenge for Israel. Amid the fighting, the navy successfully integrated four new German-made corvettes into operational service. Looking ahead, it is preparing to receive Reshef-class ships, recently approved for production, which will replace aging Sa’ar 4.5-class vessels in about two years. Patrolling the Lebanese Front The Lebanese town of Naqoura, located in the western sector near the Israeli border, is hidden from view due to the region’s topography. However, its buildings are clearly visible from navy missile ships patrolling kilometers offshore. Recently, Israeli forces from the 146th Division withdrew from the area as the Lebanese army moved south. These troops remain under constant naval cover, even in deeper inland areas with no direct line of sight. 'We’ve hit reset with Hezbollah, collecting new intelligence and refreshing our target database, even from the sea,' Col. A. told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth. One of the navy’s newest missile ships, the INS Nitzachon, stands six stories tall. Throughout the war, all types of missile boat weaponry have been deployed, including the cutting-edge and highly expensive ALRAD missiles, which cost tens of millions of shekels per unit. 'One of our greatest achievements in this war has been protecting Israel’s energy independence,' said Col. A. 'Gas production from offshore rigs never stopped. Had they been hit, Israel would have experienced widespread power outages.' He noted that unlike the 2006 Lebanon War, cargo shipments to Haifa continued uninterrupted. 'That’s not something to take for granted. Hezbollah has significantly upgraded its arsenal since 2006, but our missile boats are executing both powerful defenses and lethal offensives simultaneously.' A Stealthy Naval Force The missile ships’ weaponry remains mostly concealed. These vessels feature stealth technology that reduces their radar signature, making them appear lightly armed at first glance, with only a 76mm cannon up front and two missile batteries at the rear. However, the ships were designed by German engineers to hide their advanced weaponry, including special Iron Dome launchers, inside the hull, revealing them only during launch sequences. This stealth capability helps evade enemy radar detection. INS Nitzachon also employs state-of-the-art electronic warfare systems, with a powerful 360-degree radar that remains stationary, unlike older rotating models, and can detect launches as far away as Turkey. 'Our ship is like a microcosm of the air force, equipped with an air control unit, Iron Dome, and deadly weaponry, all at sea,' the flotilla commander explained. Inside the ship’s Combat Information Center, dimly lit screens flicker with orange, green, and red indicators. The room is divided into three sections—detection, defense, and offense—where 19- and 20-year-old female operators monitor the battlespace. In contrast, similar positions in Western navies, such as in France or the United States, are typically manned by seasoned personnel in their 30s or 40s. 'When a shift commander steps down from the bridge, their eyes take a minute or two to adjust to the light or darkness. That’s a long time in combat,' Col. A. explained. The ship’s exercises highlight just how crowded the skies and waters of the Mediterranean have become. If an unidentified airborne target suddenly appears, operators must first classify it, confirm its identity, and then determine the best response—whether to engage from their own ship, another naval vessel, or rely on air force or missile defense systems. 'In one operation, we were launching strikes on a key Hezbollah asset when a hostile drone suddenly appeared,' a crew member recalled. 'One section of the combat center focused on intercepting the drone, while another continued the attack—both simultaneously, without pausing.' The Battle at Sea During the war, Israeli naval forces even intercepted drones launched from Yemen under surreal circumstances. 'We were in the Red Sea, hearing party music from hotels in Eilat, watching fireworks and celebrations in the distance—while at the same time, we knew a drone was en route. But we intercepted it far from Israeli shores, ensuring safety without disruption,' a sailor recounted. Despite the relative calm following the ceasefire, vigilance remains high. For Col. A. and his subordinates, a Hezbollah coastal missile launch is a constant threat. The commander recalled a mission two months ago when his unit obliterated the Syrian navy. 'We reached just a few kilometers from the Syrian coast and watched their ships sink as their ports burned. When we returned to Haifa, Navy Chief Vice Adm. David Saar Salama was waiting on the dock. He congratulated us and immediately ordered us back out to protect the gas rigs.' INS Nitzachon is also led by Deputy Commander Maj. A., and soon, the Israeli Navy is set to appoint its first-ever female missile boat commander. The navy is preparing to integrate more female combatants, not only in officer roles but also on the upcoming Reshef-class ships. 'They’re the backbone of the ship—brilliant and exceptional,' said Col. A. 'At the height of the war, we had an entire armada at sea, with over 1,000 navy personnel operating simultaneously, from Syria to the Red Sea.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/h1gn7g7qke	2025-02-19T00:46:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/yk14265816/yk14265816_0_75_912_514_0_small.jpg

Dozens of Hasidim clash with IDF while attempting to cross into L...	Group traveled to the area to visit the tomb of Rabbi Ashi in second similar incident within less than a week; four arrested facing remand; Two IDF soldiers were lightly injured Dozens of ultra-Orthodox Jews clashed with IDF soldiers overnight Tuesday after they attempted to reach the tomb of Rabbi Ashi, a Jewish sage, located in Lebanese territory. Four were arrested after throwing stones at Israeli soldiers who arrived to disperse them. Two IDF soldiers were lightly injured during the clashes. The soldiers received medical treatment and were evacuated to a hospital. Members of the Hassidic Breslov sect succeeded to cross into Lebanon last week near the tomb complex and were later returned to Israel. Some were detained for questioning. 'Upon the arrival of IDF troops at the site, several individuals in the group began disturbing the peace and even threw stones at the soldiers,' the police said in statement. 'Northern District officers arrived at the scene, and after coordinating with the military, arrested four suspects on suspicion of crossing the border and disturbing the peace. The rest of the group was returned to Israeli territory by the IDF and removed from the area.' The police said that they would consider requesting an extension of the detainees’ remand at the Kiryat Shmona Magistrates' Court. They also emphasized that crossing into Lebanon was illegal and carries a prison sentence of up to four years. The tomb of Rabbi Ashi, a key figure in the compiling the Babylonian Talmud and considred one of the greatest sages of the Talmudic era, has become a major destination for members of the Breslov sect, which seeks out and visits the graves of revered rabbis in Israel and abroad. These visits have occasionally led to security incidents. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The group entered the tomb site on Mount Senan, which straddles the Israeli-Lebanese border. Until Israel’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000, the entire complex was within Israeli territory. However, as this location was a point of dispute between the two countries, the border was redrawn through the site following a recommendation by UN envoy Terje Rød-Larsen. Due to its proximity to the border, even the Israeli section of the site is now designated as a closed military zone. According to Hasidic tradition, praying at the grave of a revered rabbi is believed to bring spiritual merit. Rabbi Natan, the foremost disciple of Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, wrote in Likutey Halakhot: 'The righteous are greater in death than in life. In death, they rectify the souls of Israel even more than in life. They subdue the forces of impurity that cling to fallen souls due to their sins, for the righteous overpower and nullify these forces more in death than in life.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj3vj11xqkg	2025-02-19T00:01:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/16/r1W2srmkcJg/r1W2srmkcJg_55_0_901_507_0_small.jpg

Rehabilitation still an everyday reality for the wounded of Octob...	Survivors battling physical and emotional wounds; stories of perseverance highlight the long road of rehabilitation, marked by pain, resilience, some even find love 'As soon as I can kneel, I’ll propose' At first glance, he may seem out of place—a large man in his late 40s standing among a group of young people, the age of his soldier daughter. But then you notice the portable vacuum pump connected to him by a tube, and it makes sense. Later, during the photo shoot for this article, Superintendent Mati Tsarfati lifts his shirt to reveal a long scar running down his back, marking where the AK-47 bullet pierced him. Tsarfati, who was the operations officer of the Sderot police station, is one of the few injured from October 7 who is still in rehabilitation. Eight of his subordinates fell that morning. His story, and the stories of others—like Ron, who was injured in Gaza on December 8, 2023, and has been in recovery for over a year and two months, and Eran, who completed his rehabilitation after being injured in Khan Younis and transitioned to outpatient treatment—highlight the continuing struggles of those injured in battle. Their war persists, fought through countless challenges, not all of which end in victory. Superintendent Tsarfati was wounded by sniper fire after neutralizing several terrorists. He vividly recalls the circumstances of his injury. 'I arrived at the station, and just as I was pulling into the parking lot, a Nukhba terrorist appeared in front of me and fired five bullets, hitting my car.' Tsarfati recounts the battle in great detail, but he emphasizes the bravery of the officers who fell, some of whom fought right by his side. 'After the first encounter, where we neutralized two terrorists, I met with the district commander at the time, Deputy Commissioner Amir Cohen. Together, we charged toward the station and eliminated five more terrorists. Then I saw that one of the terrorists we had hit was still alive and trying to lift his weapon toward the district commander, so I shot him in the head. At that moment, another terrorist shot me—one bullet hit my chest, and another hit my leg. The community security officer, Ronen Gabai, along with a National Counter-Terrorism Unit officer, dragged me behind a shelter.' He lay there for three hours, bleeding but fully conscious. 'I called my wife on video, told her I was injured, that I love her and the kids, and that I would do everything to stay alive.' He kept his promise. Superintendent Tsarfati was evacuated to Barzilai Medical Center, where the medical team fought to save his life. 'When I woke up, they tried to shield me from the magnitude of the loss. But for me, the loss was overwhelming. These were my subordinates, and losing them hit me hard.' When his condition stabilized, Tsarfati was transferred to Soroka Medical Center in Be’er Sheva. 'I underwent a very complex surgery led by Dr. Shlomo Yaron Yishai, Professor Yael Refaeli, and Dr. Assaf Aker. They stitched up my lung, replaced six ribs with titanium ones, and also replaced my shoulder blade. From there, I was transferred to rehabilitation at Soroka under the supervision of Dr. Yuli Trager.' The first chapter of his rehabilitation ended on January 1, 2024. 'I was discharged from Soroka, transitioned to outpatient rehab, and simultaneously, Commander Yogev Attias, head of the Sa’ar Division (Public Order, Defense, and Sovereignty), appointed me as the operations officer.' In April of that year, Tsarfati began his new role. In August, he went on a Mediterranean cruise with his family. During the trip, he experienced unbearable pain in his wounded leg. 'When we returned to Israel, they opened up my pelvis to take a piece of bone to place in my leg. As a result, I developed a severe pelvic infection and had to undergo 23 surgeries. I’ve been here at Soroka for four months now, attached to a VAC device that drains the wound, so I can’t leave the hospital.' Tsarfati is both physically and mentally strong. In the past, he completed two full marathons. 'I know I won’t be running marathons again, but as soon as they remove the tube, I’ll get back to training.' Love formed amid rehabilitation Rehabilitation is often misunderstood as a steady path of improvement, but the reality is far from that. 'Rehabilitation is one step back, two steps forward,' says Ron Sapir, 22, from Moshav Zitan, a commander in the 603rd Engineering Battalion of the IDF. Sapir was injured by an explosive device on December 14, 2023, in southern Gaza. The incident claimed the life of Sergeant Oz Shmuel Ardi, who was sitting beside him in the Namer APC. 'I looked at my leg and realized it was barely attached, just a small piece of quadriceps muscle. My bone flew off in the explosion.' Ron was classified as critically injured. He spent a month at Soroka, where doctors saved his leg from amputation. 'When I woke up five days later, I saw my mom beside me. I asked her, ‘Do I still have my leg?’ She said, ‘Yes.’ Then I fell asleep again.' He was later transferred to the 'Back to Life' rehabilitation wing at Sheba Medical Center. 'Rehabilitation lifts you up when you’re surrounded by other injured soldiers, but when they start getting discharged and you’re left behind, it’s hard. You’re happy for them, but at the same time, you think, ‘What about me?’ It burns you up. Triple amputees who arrived after me were discharged before me. I also struggled with infections and was on antibiotics for nearly a year. I held on thanks to my family, especially my twin sister Shai, who was with me throughout rehab, and my girlfriend Maya. She’s the best thing that came out of this experience.' Ron met Maya Dimri, a law student his age, during rehab. 'I had a crush on her back in high school,' Ron admits. 'Back then, I wasn’t so interested,' Maya laughs, recounting how they reconnected. 'My mom came to Sheba to visit injured soldiers and bring gifts. She happened to pass by Ron’s room. He recognized her and shouted, ‘Maya’s mom! Maya’s mom!’ Suddenly, I get a picture of Ron from my mom.' Ron: 'I thought to myself, ‘What do I have to lose?’ I messaged her and asked her to visit me.' The rest is history. They’ve been a couple for six months now. 'But because of everything we’ve been through together, it feels like ten years.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ron: 'We’re looking for an apartment. Mention in the article—three rooms with an elevator or on the ground floor, close to Sheba.' So when’s the wedding? 'As soon as I can kneel, I’ll propose.' Eran, a 22-year-old reservist in the Yahalom Engineering Unit, is also undergoing rehabilitation at Soroka. While attached to the 13th Battalion of the Golani Brigade, he was wounded during a maneuver on the second night of Hanukkah. 'We were clearing a building in northern Gaza, preparing it for use, when I got hit in the leg by a bullet.' Eran’s injury, while seemingly minor, turned severe. He ended up at Soroka with a shattered bone, a torn artery, and recurring infections. 'I’ve had 12 surgeries so far. They took bone from my pelvis to replace the missing bone, muscle from one area, an artery from another, and skin from somewhere else,' he says, pointing to the scars on both legs. 'Two months ago, they did another bone graft, this time from my thigh. You see the light, and then you go back.' In October, Eran began studying civil engineering at Ben-Gurion University, near the hospital. Beyond pursuing a profession, the studies are part of his rehabilitation. 'I wake up at seven in the morning, do an hour of physiotherapy, and start classes at nine. Until last week, I was getting around campus on a mobility scooter; now, I use crutches. Studying distracts me from constantly dwelling on the negative.' Before enlisting, Eran was a professional athlete in tumbling (acrobatic gymnastics practiced on mats). He placed second in Israel and represented the country at the world championship in Russia. He shows a video of himself doing nine consecutive flips in the air. 'I’ll get back to it, even if not at the same level,' he promises. Watching him fight to reclaim his life, it’s hard not to doubt his determination. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bywg6hf91x	2025-02-18T23:49:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/BygLMGBe9Jx/BygLMGBe9Jx_0_46_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Can the IDF and UNIFIL prevent a future Hezbollah attack on Israe...	While daily life in northern Israel has improved—with no sirens, no shelter runs, and schools operating as usual—concerns linger As tensions persist along Israel’s northern border, residents of the region remain cautiously optimistic about the withdrawal from Lebanon, according to Avraham Levine, the ALMA Research Center media manager. While daily life has improved—with no sirens, no shelter runs, and schools operating as usual—concerns linger. 'Are we counting on these other forces and agreements, or do we still have to rely on the IDF? I think the answer is obvious,' Levine said. Despite renewed efforts to deploy the Lebanese Armed Forces and UNIFIL in southern Lebanon, experts remain skeptical about their ability to curb Hezbollah’s influence. Levine noted that similar measures taken after the 2006 war largely failed, and recent reports of attacks on UNIFIL forces further highlight the fragile situation. Meanwhile, the U.S. has ramped up pressure, with reports that U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing for Hezbollah’s full demilitarization. To mitigate immediate threats, the IDF is holding key strategic outposts along the border, securing high vantage points that allow surveillance and deterrence against potential Hezbollah attacks. 'If the IDF is there, Hezbollah is not there,' Levine emphasized, pointing to the critical role of these positions in preventing incursions similar to the October 7 attack. While these measures offer short-term security, the long-term stability of northern Israel remains uncertain, he said.

Hamas says open to new Gaza leadership, but refuses to disarm or ...	Terror group's spokesperson says that the issue of governance in the enclave will be discussed in the second phase of negotiations, set to begin in the coming days Hamas said that it does not see a necessity to govern the Gaza Strip in the future, but the group made it clear that withdrawing from Gaza or disarming was not an option. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told the Al Arabiya network late on Tuesday that the issue of governance in Gaza will be discussed in the second phase of negotiations, which are set to begin in the coming days. 'Any future arrangement will be reached through national (Palestinian) consensus,' Qassem added. 'There is no need for Hamas to be in Gaza's government in the future. We have made concessions regarding the future of governance, but we have every right to remain part of the political landscape,' Qassem said. In practice, it appears that Hamas is attempting to replicate Hezbollah’s model in Lebanon: the group would not assume civil control over the Strip or be responsible for the welfare and needs of its residents. Instead, it could focus its resources entirely on 'resistance'—meaning preparations for war with Israel. Since Hamas remains the dominant military force in Gaza, it would dictate the reality on the ground, while civilian officials could effectively act as its proxies. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Meanwhile, the Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar cited Egyptian sources claiming that 'Israel has no desire to accelerate the pace of negotiations in the coming days.' According to the report, Cairo perceives this as an attempt to maintain the current situation, in which aid shipments to Gaza remain restricted, slowing efforts to rebuild. There were also concerns in Egypt that Israel may renege on an agreement to allow caravans into Gaza on Thursday. According to the sources cited in Al-Akhbar, Israel's measures stem from a 'desire to open the door for voluntary migration from Gaza and render the Strip uninhabitable.' Another report, in the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, quoted different Egyptian sources who said that Cairo has been consulting with European Union representatives to establish a joint oversight mechanism for a temporary committee composed of independent Palestinian figures unaffiliated with Hamas, Fatah, or the Palestinian Authority. According to the report, this committee would manage Gaza under direct Egyptian supervision with European monitoring. The sources told the newspaper that The Egyptian government had reached understandings with Hamas regarding its removal from all aspects of civilian and security governance in Gaza, and noted that Hamas had shown flexibility and cooperation. Such a committee could theoretically align with Israel’s demands, as outlined on Monday by Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar. The negotiations on the second phase of the agreement are expected to begin this week, led by Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, who will engage in talks with U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff. On Monday, Israeli officials emphasized that the requirements for the next phase include the demilitarization of Gaza. Additionally, Israel made clear that any form of Hamas, Fatah, or Palestinian Authority rule over the Strip would be unacceptable. 'We will not agree to the continued presence of Hamas or any other terrorist organization in Gaza,' Sa’ar said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjrynwxqjg	2025-02-18T22:50:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/rylgkGJ0Kyg/rylgkGJ0Kyg_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Israel, India accelerate free trade talks	The latest push comes as Israel sent its largest-ever business delegation to India, marking a major step in strengthening economic ties Israel and India are moving toward a historic free trade agreement, with negotiations expected to conclude by the end of the year. The latest push comes as Israel sent its largest-ever business delegation to India, marking a major step in strengthening economic ties. Over 100 Israeli companies—spanning cybersecurity, smart agriculture, renewable energy, and AI—participated in more than 600 business meetings with Indian counterparts. The goal? Expanding Israeli exports, securing investments, and fostering bilateral trade. India’s commerce and industry minister highlighted the vast opportunities for collaboration and announced plans to lead a delegation of Indian executives to Israel next year to advance partnerships in key sectors. With bilateral trade already reaching $5 billion in 2024, both nations see immense potential for growth. Israel is India’s fourth-largest supplier of military hardware, and cooperation is expanding in water systems, healthcare, and solar energy. The momentum also aligns with U.S. efforts to establish a new trade corridor linking India, Israel, and Europe. Officials say the free trade agreement will serve as a key pillar in this ambitious economic initiative. As both nations prepare for next year’s business delegation to Israel, expectations are high that this partnership will shape the future of trade and innovation in the region.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyysbwq5jg	2025-02-18T22:22:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/SyGtU11m5yx/SyGtU11m5yx_78_0_947_533_0_small.jpg
Scramble to avoid crisis after Israeli envoy accuses Egypt of pea...	WJC president Ron Lauder rushes to meet President el-Sisi to ease tensions and reaffirm diplomatic ties after Israeli US Ambassador Yehiel Leiter accused Egypt of undermining peace agreements with Israel, bolstering military presence in Sinai World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder arrived in Cairo on Tuesday for a swiftly arranged meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and the country’s intelligence chief, General Hassan Rashad after Israeli Ambassador to Washington Yehiel Leiter accused Egypt of 'deliberately undermining its peace agreements with Israel.' Leiter claimed that Cairo was 'building up an enhanced Egyptian force in Sinai.' According to statements from the Egyptian presidency, the discussion focused on Egypt’s efforts to achieve regional peace and establish a Palestinian state. El-Sissi emphasized his desire for 'all involved parties,' including Israel, to 'act with full responsibility' to ensure that the ceasefire remains in place. Lauder, in turn, praised el-Sissi for his 'proper leadership.' However, two senior Egyptian officials revealed that Lauder had rushed to Cairo in an effort to ease tensions following Ambassador Leiter’s blunt statements. In a broadcasted conversation with Jewish leaders in the United States, Leiter had claimed that 'the Egyptian bases established in Sinai are primarily for offensive weapons, which constitutes a blatant violation of the peace agreements'—and questioned: 'Who is the Egyptian army preparing to attack?' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Although Leiter’s remarks were quickly deleted from online platforms, they had already been reported by American and Israeli media, which noted that this was the first time a senior Israeli official had accused Egypt of such a significant violation of the peace accords. In response, ten of Egypt’s most prominent television hosts took to the airwaves to 'defend the nation’s honor,' ridiculing the ambassador’s statements. One after another, they declared, 'No one wants to go to war—but if we must, we are ready and prepared.' Lauder sought to reassure his Egyptian counterparts, emphasizing his commitment to the president’s position, highlighting the strong relationship between Egypt’s presidential palace and American Jewry, and praising Egypt’s efforts—under el-Sissi’s leadership—to achieve peace in the Middle East. He also expressed anticipation for Egypt’s forthcoming proposal at the Arab summit regarding Gaza’s future and reconstruction plans. El-Sissi confirmed that he would participate in the upcoming mini-Arab summit in Riyadh over the weekend and would expand on these issues at the full Arab League summit in Cairo, where 22 Arab leaders are expected to attend. He stressed that 'reconstruction plans will proceed without displacing Gaza’s residents.' Lauder, in turn, congratulated the Egyptian president on his 'wise counsel.' A senior Egyptian official told Ynet and its sister publication Yedioth Ahronoth that Lauder appeared embarrassed when presented with a transcript of Ambassador Leiter’s remarks. The transcript included el-Sissi’s statements asserting that Egypt 'is committed to establishing a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders, with its capital declared in East Jerusalem.' Lauder did not respond. 'It was clear to us,' the Egyptian official said, 'that Lauder understands Egypt’s role as a mediator between Israel and Hamas, and he repeatedly emphasized Israel’s appreciation for the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. There is no doubt that Lauder came to defuse the tensions sparked by the ambassador’s comments. It was important for him to reaffirm the respect the U.S. holds for the peace agreements.' This is not the first time Israel has accused Egypt of violating the peace accords, but tensions have escalated due to President Donald Trump’s request that el-Sissi absorb a significant portion of Gaza’s population into Egyptian territory. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'gave the impression' that he was open to the American plan. Meanwhile, a mini-Arab summit is set to take place this week in Riyadh, attended by leaders from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and the Gulf states, with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas also expected to participate. The meeting is intended to prepare for the full Arab League summit in Cairo, originally scheduled for February 27. On Monday, the event was postponed to March 4. Arab League Deputy Secretary-General Hossam Zaki attributed the delay to 'logistical issues.' Behind the scenes, however, it was made clear that the U.S. administration had expressed strong dissatisfaction with the summit’s agenda, prompting the postponement to allow for a more moderated final statement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjmifl75yl	2025-02-18T22:12:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/BJGNpZ11cyg/BJGNpZ11cyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

The pope has pneumonia in both lungs but remains in good spirits,...	Holy See says 88-year-old pontiff's respiratory infection also involves asthmatic bronchitis, which requires the use of cortisone antibiotic treatment, adding that his condition continues to be 'complex' ROME (AP) — Pope Francis has developed pneumonia in both lungs, the Vatican said Tuesday, after new tests showed a further complication in the condition of the 88-year-old pontiff that raised concerns about his ability to fight off the infection. The Vatican said Francis’ respiratory infection also involves asthmatic bronchitis, which requires the use of cortisone antibiotic treatment. 'Laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and the Holy Father’s clinical condition continue to present a complex picture,' the Vatican said. Nevertheless the pope, who had the upper lobe of his right lung removed as a young man, is in good spirits and is grateful for the prayers for his recovery, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a late update. Francis was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital in a 'fair' condition on Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. On Monday, medical personnel determined that he was suffering from a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, meaning a mix of viruses, bacteria and possibly other organisms had colonized in his respiratory tract. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The follow-up chest CT scan which the Holy Father underwent this afternoon ... demonstrated the onset of bilateral pneumonia, which required additional drug therapy,' Bruni said. Bronchitis can lead to pneumonia, which is a deeper and far more serious infection of the lungs’ air sacs. Pneumonia can develop in part of one lung or an entire lung or both lungs. It tends to be more serious when both lungs are affected because there isn’t healthy lung tissue to compensate. Treatment varies by severity but can include providing oxygen through a nasal tube or mask, intravenous fluids – and treatment of the underlying cause of the infection. To date Francis is not known to be using supplemental oxygen, and he has eaten breakfast every day, read the newspapers and done some work from his hospital room. The Vatican hasn’t provided any information about how Francis is responding to any of the drugs he has been given other than to say he isn’t running a fever. Dr. Carmelo D’Asero, an infectious disease and geriatric disease expert in Rome, said Francis’ lack of a fever was not necessarily a positive thing, given the seriousness of his infection. 'A high fever is a sign of an immune response to a pathogen,' he said. 'Having a low fever and having a serious bronchial infection ... is a sign of a decreased immune response and that makes us worry a little bit more, let’s say. Maybe if he had a fever, it would have been better.' The Vatican has given no indication of how long the pope might remain hospitalized, only saying that the treatment of such a 'complex clinical picture,' which has already required several changes in his drug regimen, would require an 'adequate' stay. Despite the less than positive news about Francis’ condition, a rainbow appeared over the Gemelli hospital on Tuesday afternoon and Francis received get-well drawings and cards from children being treated in the hospital’s oncology ward. In a sign that other Vatican business was proceeding as usual Tuesday, the Vatican No. 2, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, continued his delicate visit to Burkina Faso and another top Vatican cardinal, Cardinal Michael Czerny, prepared to leave Wednesday for a five-day visit to Lebanon. But other business had to be canceled. There will be no weekly general audience Wednesday, and it’s not clear if Francis will miss his Sunday noon blessing for a second week in a row. His hospitalization has also forced the cancellation of some events surrounding the Vatican Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century ceremony in which millions of pilgrims flock to Rome. This Holy Year weekend was dedicated to deacons, the ministry that is a necessary step for men who are preparing to become priests. Francis had an unrelated audience Saturday and was supposed to have ordained the deacons during a Mass on Sunday. The Vatican on Tuesday announced his audience was canceled and that the archbishop who is organizing the Jubilee would celebrate the Mass in the pope’s place. It’s a similar arrangement that the Vatican announced last weekend when artists in town had to settle for a scrapped papal audience and a cardinal presiding over their special Mass. The next Jubilee events on the calendar that would typically involve the pope are the March 8-9 weekend dedicated to volunteers. Francis had part of one lung removed after a pulmonary infection as a young man and is prone to bouts of bronchitis in winter. He has admitted in the past that he is a non-compliant patient, and even his close Vatican aides have said he pushed himself too far even once his bronchitis was diagnosed. He refused to let up on his busy schedule and ignored medical advice to stay indoors during Rome’s chilly winter, insisting on sitting through an outdoor Jubilee Mass for the armed forces on Feb. 9 even though he was having trouble breathing. Francis’ hospital admission this year has already sidelined him for longer than a 2023 hospitalization for pneumonia. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyggulq5yx	2025-02-18T21:25:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/rJUUs2g5Jl/rJUUs2g5Jl_0_195_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Florida hate crimes unit probes shooting of Israelis thought to b...	After Mordechai Brafman is charged earlier with two counts of attempted murder Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava thanks prosecutors on X for 'pursuing hate crimes charges' Local prosecutors in Florida said on Tuesday their hate crimes unit was probing a shooting by a male suspect who, according to police, fired on two men he thought were Palestinians but turned out to be Israeli visitors. The Miami-Dade state attorney's office said its hate crimes unit 'reviews every criminal offense that has the potential of being motivated by hate.' Rights advocates note a rise in anti-Muslim, anti-Palestinian and antisemitic hate since the start of U.S. ally Israel's war in Gaza following an October 7, 2023, Hamas massacre. The website of Miami-Dade County Corrections says the suspect, 27-year-old Mordechai Brafman, was charged earlier with two counts of attempted murder and booked on Sunday for the shooting on Saturday. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava thanked prosecutors on X for 'pursuing hate crimes charges.' According to investigators, Brafman overtook the victims' car in Miami Beach, made a U-turn, exited his vehicle and fired 17 shots at them. Local authorities said there was no prior confrontation between Brafman and the victims, who did not know each other. Brafman, when interviewed by police, said that while he was driving his truck in Miami Beach, he saw two people he thought were Palestinians. He said that he then stopped, shot at and killed them, according to police. However, the victims survived. One was shot in the shoulder and the other had a wounded forearm. They turned out to be Israelis and not Palestinians, police said. Dustin Tischler, a lawyer for Brafman, told the Washington Post they were 'fully cooperating with law enforcement' and 'acknowledge the seriousness of the allegations.' He added Brafman had been 'experiencing a severe mental health crisis which caused him to be in fear for his life.'

Incidents raising alarm over antisemitism include threats of violence against Jews at Cornell University that led to a conviction and sentencing, an unsuccessful plot to attack a New York Jewish center and physical assaults against a Jewish man in Michigan, a rabbi in Maryland and two Jewish students in Chicago. Also in Florida, a local chapter of one of North America's largest fraternities, Pi Gamma Delta, at the University of Central Floriday (UCF) came under investigation into alleged 'antisemitic hazing rituals.'

The incident has drawn strong condemnation from university officials and Jewish organizations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1gwxfg5je	2025-02-18T20:04:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/rywmrwxcJe/rywmrwxcJe_1_0_975_548_0_small.jpg

Marian Turski, Holocaust survivor and 'guardian of memory' who wa...	He survived two Nazi death marches, and was a co-founder of the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews and an advocate of Polish-Jewish understanding; Marian Turski, a Holocaust survivor who became a journalist and historian in postwar Poland and co-founded Warsaw’s landmark Jewish history museum, died on Tuesday. He was 98. The POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews announced his death, describing him as a person of exceptional moral and intellectual qualities who always stood on the side 'of minorities, the excluded, the wronged.' 'An authority of global importance, an advocate of Polish-Jewish understanding, a publicist, a historian. A Polish Jew. A person without whom our museum would not exist,' the museum director, Zygmunt Stępiński, wrote in a statement. Turski survived the Lodz ghetto, where he and his family were forced to live, two death marches and imprisonment at the Nazi German concentration camps Buchenwald and Auschwitz-Birkenau, which was in German-occupied Poland. In all, he lost 39 relatives in the Holocaust. Unlike many Jewish survivors who left postwar Poland, Turski chose to remain. He was on the political left his entire life, and was a member of the communist party. While on a scholarship to the United States in 1956, he marched from Selma to Montgomery with Martin Luther King Jr. in support of civil rights for Black Americans. Turski was among a dwindling number of Holocaust survivors and spoke during observances last month marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. Turski called on people to not remain indifferent when minorities are discriminated against, when history is distorted and when 'any authority violates the existing social contract' It was a stark warning about the dangers of indifference at the 75th anniversary that brought him international attention and raised his moral profile among his supporters. Turski said at the time that the Holocaust did not 'fall from the sky' all at once but took hold step by step as society’s acceptance of small acts of discrimination eventually led to ghettos and extermination camps. With world leaders in the audience, Turski called on people to not remain indifferent when minorities are discriminated against, when history is distorted and when 'any authority violates the existing social contract.' Many in Poland interpreted his words as a critique of the right-wing government in power at the time. Some who felt targeted criticized him for using the Auschwitz anniversary to comment on the political situation, or suggested that Turski lacked the moral authority for such a warning because of his past support for communism. Citing the words of another survivor, Roman Kent, Turski described what should be the Eleventh Commandment of the Bible: 'Though shalt not be indifferent. 'Because if you are indifferent, before you know it, another Auschwitz will come out of the blue for you or your descendants,' he warned. Poland’s chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, said members of the Jewish community would miss him greatly. 'Marian was our teacher, he was our moral voice and mentor. He was steeped in Jewish wisdom and used it to guide us on how to face today’s problems. We are so blessed that we had Marian with us for so many years,' Schudrich said. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Tuesday after Turski’s death that those words had become 'a motto for us,' adding on X: 'The 11th Commandment for these difficult times.' Poland’s conservative President Andrzej Duda also paid tribute to Turski, saying: 'He consistently spoke about the need to cultivate sensitivity to evil. May his memory be honored!' Turski was born on June 26, 1926, as Mosze Turbowicz and spent his childhood and teenage years in Lodz, where he attended a Hebrew language school. In 1944, his parents and brother were deported to the German Nazi camp Auschwitz, and he arrived there two weeks later in one of the last transports. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: His father and brother died in the gas chambers, while his mother was sent to work at the Bergen Belsen camp in northern Germany, and Turski was dispatched to work on roads in the Auschwitz-Birkenau area before being sent on two death marches. He was liberated at Terezin, close to death from exhaustion and typhus. In September 1945, he returned to Poland, a committed communist who rejected an offer to go to the West and wanted to help build a socialist Poland. When a communist official recommended that he change his name to adopt one that didn’t sound Jewish, he complied, a biography published by the POLIN museum said. He used his last time on the stage at last month’s Auschwitz anniversary observance to warn of the dangers of hatred and to recall that the number of those murdered was always far greater than the smaller group of survivors. 'We have always been a tiny minority,' Turski said. 'And now only a handful remain.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyfticfcke	2025-02-18T14:38:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/ByQEm7SOyx/ByQEm7SOyx_0_41_941_529_0_small.jpg
After a decade in Hamas captivity, hostages Avera Mengistu, Hisha...	After over 3,500 days in captivity the two Israeli civilians are set to be released as part of the hostage deal; Their long-awaited return brings relief to their families, who have spent years fighting for their release while grappling with uncertainty over their fate Two Israelis who have been held captive in Gaza for nearly a decade are set to return home as part of the latest hostage deal — Avera Mengistu, who will be released after 3,821 days in captivity, and Hisham al-Sayed, who has been held for 3,595 days. For Mengistu’s family, the news brings an end to more than 10 years of uncertainty. 'We are overwhelmed with emotions,' said Gil Elias, 48, a relative who has led efforts to bring Mengistu home. He said that Mengistu’s mother, Agarnesh, received the long-awaited phone call confirming his release. 'His parents, siblings, and the entire family will be there to welcome him. These are joyous and surprising news that we have been waiting for over a decade,' Elias told Ynet. 'I believe he’s okay. If he has survived all these years, he must have found a way to endure,' Elias added. 'Maybe when someone is taken out of their comfort zone, they discover strengths they never knew they had. We don’t know for sure — but we will soon. We just want him back.' Years of waiting and uncertainty Mengistu, a man with mental health issues, crossed into Gaza on Sept. 7, 2014. His family has fought for years to prove he did not enter of his own free will. 'At first, people didn’t understand what we were saying. They told us, ‘It’s your problem, he went on his own,’' Elias recalled last month, when reports surfaced that Mengistu had been included in the first phase of the hostage deal. 'It was hard to explain the situation and the military failure that allowed it to happen.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In the family’s living room in Ashkelon, a photo of Mengistu from a Hamas-released video sits at the center of the room. 'As time went by, many assumed he was no longer alive, but I always believed he was,' Elias said. Last May, the family received another confirmation that Mengistu was still alive. 'We know his mental and physical health are in terrible condition, but we don’t know exactly what state he will be in when he returns,' Elias said at the time. Hisham al-Sayed’s family: ‘A decade of waiting’ Al-Sayed, a Bedouin resident of southern Israel, was born on Feb. 15, 1988. Just three days ago, he marked his 37th birthday in captivity — his ninth in Gaza since he crossed the border on April 21, 2015. 'Hisham will be home after 3,595 days — almost a decade of waiting,' his family said in a statement. 'But the news of his release will not feel complete until every hostage returns. This deal must not stop. No one should endure a decade in captivity.' The last proof of life his family received was in 2022 when Hamas released a video showing him in Gaza, connected to an oxygen mask. 'Seeing that footage didn’t give us hope — it just told us he was still alive,' his father said. Since the October 7 Hamas terror attack, al-Sayed’s father has found himself supporting families who are now experiencing the same pain he has lived with for nearly a decade. 'We met Ethiopian families, families of soldiers — it didn’t feel like there were any differences between us,' he said. 'After October 7, the number of hostages was overwhelming. It took me two weeks just to process what had happened. We try to support as many families as we can, regardless of politics. This is about bringing people home.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkcw00yzc1g	2025-02-18T14:21:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/01/18/r1G4HISsi/r1G4HISsi_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
As Lebanese celebrate return to border villages, Hezbollah terror...	Residents celebrated Israel's withdrawal from border villages, but returning locals were shocked by the destruction: 'No houses, no plants, nothing'; In Kila, where '90% of buildings were destroyed', two Hezbollah operatives reportedly emerged from the rubble after contact with them was cut off 3 months ago; Supporters of the terror group claimed the IDF lied: 'South Lebanon hasn't been cleared of terrorists' Israel has almost completely withdrawn from southern Lebanon, with the Lebanese condemning the continued 'occupation' in five strategic points along the border. At the same time, they are celebrating the return to their villages in the south, but are still reeling from the immense destruction left behind. 'What I’m seeing is unbelievable. I’m in shock,' said Khoddo Suleiman, a construction worker who returned Tuesday to the village of Kila. Pointing to his destroyed home on a hill, he added, 'There’s no house, no vegetation, nothing. I feel a mix of joy and sadness.' Suleiman had fled Kila about six months ago due to the intensification of battles at that time. The IDF on Tuesday completed its withdrawal from the last of the villages near the border that it still controlled, in accordance with the cease-fire agreement with Hezbollah that came into effect in late November. The withdrawal was originally scheduled for two weeks ago, but the deadline was extended in coordination with the U.S. after Israel called for increased Lebanese military activity in the area south of the Litani River, where Hezbollah was prohibited from operating. Despite the withdrawal, Israel maintains a presence at five strategic points along the border in the hills, where military outposts were established to ensure better protection for northern Israeli communities. In Lebanon, there have been calls for a complete withdrawal, with criticism of Israel’s continued 'occupation,' but there is also hope that the cease-fire will hold. Hezbollah has not issued any significant threats, though tensions remain. The IDF has already withdrawn from numerous villages where it had been engaged in operations to dismantle Hezbollah’s vast terror infrastructure. The result was widespread destruction in these areas, and in recent weeks, clashes have occurred between Lebanese residents trying to return to these areas and Lebanese forces. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On Tuesday morning, the Lebanese military announced that following the completion of the Israeli withdrawal, its forces had been deployed in 11 additional southern Lebanese villages: Al-Abbasiya, Al-Majidiya, Kila, Al-Adisa, Markaba, Houla, Miss Al-Jabal, Blida, Muhaybib, Maroun al-Ras, and parts of Yaroun. Israeli drones hovered overhead as destruction remained on the ground. 'We’ll rebuild from scratch,' said 36-year-old mechanic Atif Arabi, who returned to Kila with hopes of discovering whether his home had survived the fighting. He added, 'I’m very happy to return to finally find out if my house is destroyed. If it is, I will rebuild it.' Hussein Fares, another resident who fled in October 2023, said he had waited a year and a half for this moment. 'I counted the seconds until today,' he said, though he acknowledged the rebuilding process would be long and complex. The mayor of Kila, Hassan Sheit, told The Associated Press that the devastation in the village is enormous, with 90% of homes destroyed and the remainder damaged. 'There is no house or structure standing,' he said. He noted that reconstruction would have to start 'from zero.' Photos from Kila show the widespread destruction, but reports also emerged Tueday of a surprising discovery in the village: Two young men were found alive under the rubble. Their families had lost contact with them three months ago, and they were presumed dead. They were rushed to the hospital. Although not explicitly stated in the reports, the two men are believed to be Hezbollah terrorists, and one was filmed being welcomed home with Hezbollah flags in Kila. Ali Murtada, a well-known reporter for the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen network, posted a video on X, referring to the two men as 'fighters' of Hezbollah. 'Hello, my enemies. I hope you have a very bad day,' he said in English, addressing Israelis. This appears to be part of psychological warfare aimed at deterring residents from returning to villages in northern Israel. Murtada claimed that the discovery of the two men proves that the IDF and the Israeli government 'are lying' to the public. 'After bombing Kila for a year with more than 2,000 airstrikes, after fighting inside Kila and occupying it for two months, after staying there and bombing houses and all infrastructure, and searching under every stone to find or kill Hezbollah fighters, now, after your withdrawal, two Hezbollah fighters were found alive in Kila,' Murtada said. 'Your army needs an eye exam. It lies to you, saying all of southern Lebanon is now clear of Hezbollah fighters. But when they were in Kila, two Hezbollah fighters were there, and you didn’t know.' The credibility of these claims is unclear, but the fear remains that Hezbollah could operate in the shadows to rebuild its capabilities, taking advantage of the reconstruction efforts in the destroyed villages. Israel has promised to act decisively against any violation of the ceasefire, and throughout the truce, IDF strikes in deep southern Lebanon have continued, although far less frequently than before and without significant Hezbollah retaliation. Hezbollah has refrained from issuing any real threats as part of its demand for Israel to withdraw completely from the five strategic points along the border. A prominent Hezbollah member of parliament, Hassan Fadlallah, who returned Tuesday to the village of Yaroun, told Reuters that 'the main responsibility' for the 'liberation' of these hills rests with the Lebanese government. The Lebanese government has indicated that only Lebanon should make decisions regarding 'war or peace,' a likely signal that Hezbollah, whose internal strength has diminished due to the war and the decimation of its leadership, does not want to drag Lebanon into another destructive conflict as it did on October 8, 2023, when it launched a 'support front' for Hamas, just a day after the massacre. Fadlallah also spoke to Hezbollah’s Al-Manar channel, saying, 'Every day of liberation is a day of pride, honor and humanity. The government has a great national responsibility, beyond expelling the enemy from the land it occupies. From these borders, we salute our supreme leader (Nasrallah) and tell him that even if his body is absent, his spirit is present.' The Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper Al-Akhbar also published a defiant cartoon Tuesday morning, depicting a blood-stained hand emerging from the rubble, holding a rifle. The caption read, 'We will not lay down our weapons.' However, in a parallel report, Al-Akhbar acknowledged that Israel had managed to secure through the cease-fire agreement what it had failed to achieve during the fighting. Cited sources indicated that Israel would continue to 'occupy five points, just like the 13 points it occupied since 2006'— referring to 18 points that 'may not be part of the land demarcation that the U.S. promised after the war.' Lebanese President Michel Aoun, according to the sources, requested international support from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, the U.S. and France to change the decision allowing Israel to maintain its presence in certain southern villages. He argued that 'Israel’s continued presence in the south means the possibility of war again,' and that it cannot be guaranteed that Hezbollah 'won’t resume its activities.' He added, 'Lebanon has committed to the agreement it signed, but Israel insists on violating it, and the countries that guaranteed the agreement must intervene.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy4luvz51g	2025-02-18T14:17:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/SJggh77fckx/SJggh77fckx_0_191_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Some hostage families are still waiting to learn if their loved o...	Families anxiously await confirmation of whether their loved ones are alive or dead, as six hostages are set to be freed Saturday; Meanwhile, Israel prepares to identify and bury victims whose remains will be returned in the coming days; 'How can they not tell us anything? How can they leave us to figure it out on our own?' The families of Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen, Tal Shoham, Avera Mengistu, and Hisham al-Sayed have been informed that their loved ones will be released alive on Saturday. These will be the final living hostages released as part of Phase I of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. However, 14 hostages remain to be released in Phase I, and for some no official information has been provided. The Bibas family stated on Tuesday evening they are aware of Hamas' announcement that Shiri, Kfir and Ariel Bibas will be returned during the exchange of bodies on Thursday. However, they clarified that they have not received an official confirmation on the matter from Israeli authorities. The same applies to the family of hostage Itzhak Elgarat and to Shlomo Mansour, who the IDF recently confirmed was killed on October 7. According to the agreement, four deceased hostages will be returned this Thursday, and four more next week. Danny Elgarat, Itzhak’s brother, said: 'I was contacted this morning and informed that six living hostages will arrive on Saturday, and four bodies will be returned on Thursday. They didn’t tell me anything beyond that, nor did they give me names. It’s not my job to calculate or draw conclusions about whether my brother is alive or not.' 'If they’re publishing the names of six living hostages, it means the rest are not alive — but no one in our family has been officially informed,' Danny added. 'The last update I have about Itzik is that there are serious concerns about his life, and until the state tells me otherwise that’s the situation as far as I’m concerned. But how can they not tell us anything? How can they leave us to figure it out on our own? This is a systemic failure — it’s an issue of emotional intelligence. We’ve been turned into objects. We’re no longer human beings.' The list of 14 hostages remaining in Phase I includes, in addition to Itzik Elgarat, Shlomo Mansour (who the IDF recently reported was killed on October 7), Oded Lifshitz (whose son said, 'The chances of him being alive are slim'), as well as Ohad Yahalomi and Tsahi Idan. Hadasa Lazar, Shlomo Mansour’s sister, told Ynet: 'We haven’t been informed about anything. We’re hearing rumors and updates about names being published. I contacted our officer, and she said they don’t know anything either — it might even happen on Thursday. Families of the living have already received their notifications, and Saturday feels so far away. But with the deceased, with the dead, we hear nothing. We’re stretched like a spring. They say four bodies are supposed to be returned, so I start planning —burial, shiva. It’s all so heartbreaking.'

They don’t have even a few more minutes to wait there,' she added. 'The prime minister should make a brave decision and bring them out. As long as the hostages are still there, I don’t see any victory. The prime minister said we’re on the brink of victory? Then I want to see them here. Then we can start rebuilding.' As part of the preparations for receiving the last six living hostages in Phase I of the deal, Israel is also preparing for another process: the identification and burial of those who will not return alive. According to the plan, Hamas will transfer the bodies to the Red Cross, which will hand them over to IDF. Bodies transferred to Israel will be taken to the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Abu Kabir, where they will be identified using advanced methods, including DNA sampling and dental imaging. Only after the identification process and definitive confirmation of the victims’ identities will military casualties be transferred to military rabbinate, and civilian casualties will be transferred to the Ministry of Religious Services. Once the dead have been identified, the 'bitter notification' team will be activated. This team, consisting of welfare professionals, police officers and IDF representatives, in collaboration with the Ministry of Religious Services and local authorities, will officially inform the families of the victims that their loved ones have been identified. Burial locations and funeral dates will then be arranged with the families according to their wishes. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkdl8ozc1e	2025-02-18T14:02:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/Hyb36QDSdkg/Hyb36QDSdkg_0_37_1280_721_0_small.jpg
The couple who adopted Abigail Edan and her 2 siblings after thei...	Zuli and Liron Mor, who survived the October 7 massacre in Kfar Aza along with their children, adopted Abigail, Michael and Amalia the children of Smadar and Roy Edan, who were killed by the terrorists; 'Maybe one day we’ll return to normal life, but right now, we live with grief every single day. We have three orphans in our home' 'When hostages return home, the ordeal doesn’t end with their release,' according to Zuli and Liron Mor of Kibbutz Kfar Aza. The couple, who adopted the three children of Ynet photographer Roy Edan and his wife, Smadar, who were both murdered on October 7, 'believe this reality will be evident in those now returning from captivity.' Liron, Smadar’s sister, and her husband, Zuli, have taken in Michael, 10, Amalia, 7, who survived October 7 by hiding in a closet during the massacre, and Abigail, 5, who was kidnapped during the Hamas terror attack and later freed in the first hostage deal. They are now raising them alongside their own three children — 13-year-old twins Zohar and Inbar, and 11-year-old Daniela — all of whom survived the massacre with their parents. Abigail was three when she was abducted and after her parents were murdered she became one of the enduring symbols of the October 7 events. Months after her release in a hostage exchange, a photo of her in the arms of U.S. President Joe Biden touched hearts worldwide. 'The state tends to think that a year and three months after their return, people should just move on — but that’s light-years away from reality,' Zuli said. 'Maybe one day we’ll return to normal life, but right now, we live with grief every single day. We have three orphans in our home.' The couple stressed that even after a year or two, the government must recognize that the trauma doesn’t simply end. 'But amid all the sorrow and tragedy, these six children give us a reason to wake up every morning,' Liron asserts. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The couple also described the complexities of their blended family. 'There’s jealousy among the siblings — because that’s how they see themselves, as full siblings,' Liron explains. 'For example, when people ask about Abigail on the street, of course, she’s a symbol, but she also has five siblings who have endured unimaginable hardships. Everything revolves around her. But she’s just one piece of our family puzzle. It’s important for people to understand — we are a family with six children.' The Mors have learned to deflect difficult or insensitive questions, but they say five-year-old Abigail cannot. 'Even with the best intentions, a five-year-old doesn’t know how to handle certain questions. And some of them are completely inappropriate — like when people ask her, ‘What did you eat in Gaza?’' Zuli said. 'Still, most of the responses we get from people are warm and supportive.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1exjog51x	2025-02-18T13:44:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/23/yk14160987/yk14160987_0_40_945_532_0_small.jpg
Holocaust survivor Marian Turski dies aged 98	Holocaust survivor Marian Turski, who became a journalist in Poland and headed an international committee of Auschwitz survivors, has died at the age of 98, said the Polish weekly magazine Polityka, where he worked as a columnist. In an article on Tuesday announcing Turski's death, Polityka described him as 'an exceptional guardian of memory, an outstanding man whose voice was heard all over the world. He was sent to the Lodz ghetto at the age of 14 and in 1944 he was transported to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp where both his father and brother died. In 1945 he survived two death marches, first from Auschwitz to Buchenwald, Buchenwald to Theresienstadt, where he was liberated by the Soviet Red Army. After World War II Turski lived in Lower Silesia, southern Poland, before moving to Warsaw, where he worked as a historian and journalist. He started working at Polityka in 1958 and was the author of several books. In January, Turski gave a speech at the commemorations of the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz in which he warned against rising antisemitism. 'Let us not be afraid to convince ourselves that we can solve problems between neighbours.' Over 3 million of Poland's 3.3 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis. In all, between 1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically killed 6 million Jews across German-occupied Europe, along with gypsies, sexual minorities, disabled people and others who offended Nazi ideas of racial superiority.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkbpfuz9jg	2025-02-18T12:24:07-08:00

The younger generation has proven what the future could hold the...	Five Fingers pre-military academy in Zichron Yaakov is training the next generation of leaders, instilling values of combat, leadership and community service. 'We have the best youth with us,' says Dror Yanai, head of the academy, which has lost 17 of its graduates in the Iron Swords War. 'They will be the leaders of the future' 'The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again' once said Theodore Roosevelt (1910). On a chilly, slightly rainy morning, the dedicated trainees of the Five Fingers pre-military academy are already hard at work. Some set out early for a run in the surrounding hills of Zichron Yaakov, others clean facilities in Jerusalem, and soon they will leave for a week-long leadership and training program. No one is idle — everyone contributes, whether by preparing breakfast, handling laundry or organizing the day’s activities. Founded in 2014, Five Fingers is an educational-social movement with a mission to empower youth to reach their full physical and mental potential through training. With 2,500 members, the organization collaborates with the Ministry of Education, the IDF, and various business and sports organizations. Many of its graduates have taken on officer roles in the military. The movement was founded by Amir Menachem, a former Navy SEAL officer, along with his father, Yoram, a professional fitness coach who trained Israel’s top basketball teams. Their vision was to develop leadership among Israeli youth through resilience and physical activity. Training for leadership and excellence Dror Yanai, 34, a former Navy SEAL, runs the academy alongside Menachem. The two are deeply involved in shaping its programs and ensuring its graduates leave prepared for elite military service. 'This movement is about developing excellence, resilience and leadership among Israeli youth,' Yanai explains. 'We operate informally and formally, reaching thousands of trainees every year.' Established in 2018, the academy in Zichron Yaakov works closely with various institutions, including military units, schools and volunteer organizations. 'I get to meet incredible young people who are eager to contribute and give their all every day,' Yanai says. The academy receives over 2,500 applications annually, but only 60% are accepted. About 40% of participants are young women. The trainees go through rigorous physical training, leadership workshops, and educational programs covering history, sports science and Zionism Preparing for military and civic leadership One of the academy’s core programs, 'Carmel,' operates from August to March, providing an additional year of training for graduates who wish to lead social change. These young leaders integrate into 'Five Fingers' as coaches and facilitators, guiding younger participants in fitness and community initiatives. The academy’s headquarters is adorned with motivational quotes, including one from former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt: 'Run, touch the point, and give your best.' Yanai explains, 'The name 'Five Fingers' comes from the idea that if you can control all five fingers, you can maximize your potential.' The movement is built on five key values: professionalism, perseverance, adaptability, leadership and national commitment. 'We aim to instill a deep sense of responsibility and initiative in our trainees, ensuring they become proactive members of Israeli society,' Menachem emphasizes. Yanai, who is waiting for a meeting with donors for the new campus, adds: 'The 'Five Fingers' work method is based on a 'body-mind' approach, which develops physical and mental abilities in parallel. This is sometimes expressed through extreme and unexpected changes in the type of training, introducing mental exercises mid-intense workouts that test motivation, adaptability, and the ability to withstand challenges.' The movement operates in various fields and is divided into the youth program, the pre-military academy, and the alumni program. The youth program runs year-round in several groups across different locations in the country. It consists of 10 monthly sessions that include both individual and group work. These sessions feature physical training, lectures and enrichment activities, with a focus on building mental resilience, instilling values, enhancing physical fitness and promoting awareness of a healthy lifestyle. 'Look at the trainees here — they are all enjoying themselves together, and, most importantly, they are succeeding in contributing. That is what truly matters to all of us here,' Yanai proudly adds. 'At the beginning, the movement relied on the personal financial investment of its founders. Gradually, as it grew, it became more established and is now funded through participation fees from its members. There is immense demand to join us.' Menachem adds: 'Most of those who join are driven by the desire to prepare for combat service, with the goal of strengthening themselves physically and mentally, and above all, being ready for selection and elite unit tryouts.' The war’s impact and rising motivation Following the October 7th attack and the Iron Swords war, the academy rapidly mobilized a volunteer operation to support evacuees and soldiers. 'We established an emergency command center to aid displaced families and reservists in combat zones. At first, one operations center was set up at the movement’s headquarters in Herzliya, and another at the academy in Zichron Yaakov. Later, the academy relocated its main activities to Eilat to support children from evacuated families in the Gaza border communities, providing them with a social framework during this period,' explains Yanai. 'During the war, there was a sharp increase in the number of applicants to the movement. Most of the trainers were called up for reserve duty, and the movement quickly trained new instructors from among its graduates. At the same time, as mentioned, throughout the war, the movement mourned the loss of 17 of its graduates — officers and soldiers who fell in battle, most of them from elite units. They were the first fallen members of Five Fingers since the movement began operating.' 'From the moment the war began, they didn’t think about themselves — they only thought about how to help,' Menachem says, his voice heavy with emotion. 'I knew most of the fallen personally. It’s heartbreaking, but we’re committed to honoring them by continuing their mission. And now, we are establishing the campus in their memory. It will include a large memorial site alongside content creation and current affairs.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Yanai continues: 'We have the most outstanding and value-driven youth here in the country. They will be the future leaders of society. As someone who works extensively with young people, I see teenagers who are eager to make a meaningful impact — they are hungry and curious. The reality of the war, as well as the situation in the country before it, has awakened them. I see an incredible level of enthusiasm among the youth. There is a massive number of boys and girls who want to train. I’m talking about trainees from 6th grade to 12th grade who come to training sessions with extremely high motivation.' Despite the war’s toll, interest in Five Fingers has surged. 'More young people are stepping up, eager to train and serve,' Yanai notes. 'We see an incredible shift — youth who once aimed for technology units are now focused on combat service, aspiring to join special forces and infantry battalions.' 'This is a generation with immense motivation and a deep sense of care,' according to Menachem. 'The moment this war began, we saw the mobilization of civil society across the entire nation, and just as importantly, we saw it in the younger generation. They are strong, value-driven, and willing to pay the price. I believe this generation has also proven what kind of future this country can have — once they are given the reins to lead and guide the nation forward.' 'The people are living in a much more united way. We want to contribute, to share the burden, but in the political world, there are interests that overshadow what is truly happening on the ground,' he continues. 'In the end, we look at ourselves — where we can make an impact, where we can contribute. Our responsibility, our sense of giving, and our commitment to continue serving remain strong. Here, we have trainees with incredible mental resilience. They go through extraordinary experiences, learning and gaining deep self-awareness, and then they go on to serve in the IDF’s top units, making an even greater and more meaningful contribution to our country.' A generation ready to lead Dikla Zarko, 18, a former ballet dancer from Kfar Saba, joined the academy after her cousin, a Five Fingers graduate, was killed in combat. 'At first, I just wanted to dance, but after his death, I knew I had to be here and contribute to the country,' she shares. These days, while setting goals for her future service in the IDF, she is also considering continuing for a second year. 'When Rif arrived at the academy and loved it so much, he told me about all the activities they do here — the enrichment, the volunteer work,' Zarko recalls. 'I realized that dancing is important, but coming here and contributing to the country is far more meaningful. And then the tragedy struck—dear Rif was killed in Gaza. At that moment, I knew I had to be here and dedicate myself to serving our people.' 'We spent a week of activities in Eilat, learning a lot and volunteering. Now, we are preparing for a week of activities in Jerusalem,' she adds. 'We come here with a deep desire to give, to serve the country, and to develop our values. That is truly what matters most — to give back, especially after the devastating tragedy that struck us all on October 7th.' In closing, she adds: 'I will always remember Rif as a kind-hearted, caring, friendly, and sensitive person who was deeply connected to those around him. I am here because of him — because it was important for me to continue his path in the place he loved so much.' Adam Meital, 18, from Tel Aviv also found new purpose at the academy. 'I didn’t know much about this place before, but I looked into it and decided to join. The experience here is tough but incredibly rewarding,' he says. 'I feel ready to serve and make a difference.' 'The young generation has proven itself,' Menachem concludes. 'They are determined, values-driven and ready to take on the future. The moment they are given the reins, they will lead this country forward.' While political divisions exist, Five Fingers fosters unity through service. 'In the end, it’s about looking at where we can contribute, how we can build resilience, and how we can strengthen our country together,' Yanai says. 'These young men and women are experiencing incredible personal growth and are preparing to give back in the most meaningful way possible — through dedicated service to Israel.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/r1syhlm5yl	2025-02-18T11:45:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/12/BJgVkL8qYkl/BJgVkL8qYkl_0_108_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Pope Francis has pneumonia in both lungs, Vatican says	Pope Francis has shown the onset of double pneumonia, further complicating treatment for the 88-year pontiff, the Vatican said on Tuesday. 'The laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and clinical conditions of the Holy Father continue to present a complex picture,' said a statement. '(A) chest CAT scan which the Holy Father received this afternoon ... showed the onset of bilaterial pneumonia that requires further pharmacological therapy,' it added. 'The laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and clinical conditions of the Holy Father continue to present a complex picture,' said a statement. '(A) chest CAT scan which the Holy Father received this afternoon ... showed the onset of bilaterial pneumonia that requires further pharmacological therapy,' it added. Bilaterial pneumonia is an infection that affects both lungs, and can make breathing difficult. Francis has been suffering from a respiratory infection for more than a week and was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on February 14. He is especially prone to lung infections because as a young adult he developed pleurisy and had part of one lung removed. A Vatican official speaking on background earlier in the day, said the pontiff had not been put on a ventilator and was breathing on his own. Ahead of the latest statement, the Vatican announced that all public events on the pope's calendar had been cancelled through Sunday. The Vatican has said Francis will stay in hospital for as long as necessary. It has not specified whether the pope is suffering from a bacterial or viral infection.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s10z1wf9yl	2025-02-18T10:30:40-08:00

These are the 6 living hostages to be released on Saturday | Read...	The families of the six remaining living hostages from Phase 1 of hostage deal have been notified their loved ones will be released on Saturday; Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed will be released after more than a decade in captivity; Eliya Cohen, Omer Wenkert, Omer Sham Tov, Tal Shoham have endured 505 days in what their families describe as hell The families of Eliya Cohen, Omer Wenkert, Omer Sham Tov, Tal Shoham, Avera Mengistu, and Hisham al-Sayed have been informed that they will be released alive from Hamas captivity this Saturday. Here are their stories as they prepare to leave the horrors of captivity behind. Eliya Cohen kidnapped from the 'shelter of death' Ziv Abud, the girlfriend of hostage Eliya Cohen, celebrated the news of his return Tuesday, writing on Instagram, 'Eliya is coming home!' Cohen had attended the Nova music festival with Abud, his nephew Amit ben Avida, and Amit’s girlfriend, Karin Shwarcman. When the Hamas terror attack began, the four took cover in a rocket shelter that later earned its grim nickname the 'shelter of death'. Ben Avida and Shwarcman were murdered, and Cohen was taken hostage. After the abduction, Abud learned that Cohen had planned to propose and had already purchased a ring. Last week Abud revealed that testimony from former captives suggested Cohen was unaware she was still alive. Cohen’s mother, Sigi, recently expressed horror over the dire conditions in which her son and Alon Ohel were being held. After the previous hostage release two weeks ago, Ahiel’s family received proof of life from him and disclosed the appalling conditions he and Cohen endured, including being chained. In March, Abud walked through the streets of Tel Aviv while much of Israel celebrated Purim. She wore a yellow dress adorned with iron chains and pictures of hostages. At the center of the dress was a bleeding heart with Cohen’s photo. 'Instead of standing under a wedding canopy in a white dress, I’m wearing yellow and holding a sign — my fiancé is a hostage in Gaza,' she said at the time. Omer Wenkert’s last message to his family Omer Wenkert and his friends arrived at the Nova music festival just an hour before the Hamas attack began. His final message to his family sent at 7:01 a.m. on Oct. 7, read: 'I’m terrified.' The eldest of three children, Wenkert was diagnosed with colitis at 14, making him particularly vulnerable in captivity. His mother described him as 'a wonderful brother with a special bond with his siblings —always smiling, friendly, and a people magnet.' Passionate about food, he invested both time and money into learning the industry, working his way up to managing a fine-dining restaurant. His dream was to become a food critic. Eight grenades were thrown into the shelter where Wenkert was hiding. Kim was murdered, and Wenkert was among the few who survived.

Omer Shem Tov was held with freed hostages Omer Shem Tov, 22, from Herzliya, was kidnapped from the Nova festival and held in captivity alongside Itay and Maya Regev, who were freed in the November 2023 hostage deal. His father, Malachi, told Ynet, 'I hope he knows we’re moving heaven and earth for him, that he’s not alone. I imagine him imagining it, sensing that we’re making enormous efforts. I wish I could send him a message to give him strength, some kind of sign.' When humanitarian groups arranged for medication to be sent to hostages, his family ensured an inhaler was included for him. 'I kept imagining that if he suddenly received an inhaler, he’d know — it would be the biggest sign that we’re doing everything to bring him home,' his father said. Tal Shoham was taken with his family Tal Shoham was abducted into Gaza along with his wife, Adi, their two young children, Neve and Yahal, his mother-in-law, and two other relatives. All were released in the previous hostage deal in 2023, but Shoham remained in captivity. On his birthday, his relative Shira Baron wrote: 'For 116 days, our lives have been defined by a relentless countdown, each day a battle to keep shouting for the hostages' immediate return. Every day is a challenge for them — a real life-or-death situation. And they are our people, our family, the ones who are essential to our lives.' Avera Mengistu: A decade in captivity On Sept. 7, 2014 — two weeks after the end of the Israel-Gaza war—Avera Mengistu crossed the border near Zikim Beach into Gaza and was taken captive. Last August, for his 38th birthday, supporters released yellow balloons in Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square in his honor. His father, Aylin, told reporters, 'For nearly 10 years, I have prayed for my son to come home.' Gil Elias, a family member, described Mengistu as a shy and reserved man with a kind heart. 'People don’t know that Avera is someone who always smiled, someone his friends loved. He would do anything for them. What many don’t realize is how deeply he was affected by his brother’s death — it left him in a state of confusion. That’s when we first saw signs of his mental struggles.' Hisham al-Sayed: Years without a sign of life Hisham al-Sayed, who has struggled with mental health issues, has been held by Hamas since 2015 after crossing the border into Gaza. His family and Israeli officials confirmed that he had crossed the border multiple times before. In 2022 — seven years into his captivity — Hamas released a video of him for the first time. His mother, Manal, recalled, 'I was relieved to see him, but I could tell he wasn’t well.' His father, Shaaban, added: 'In Islam, people with mental illnesses are not held accountable under religious law. Even God does not judge them.' Since then, the family has been demanding his unconditional release. 'He has nothing to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,' they said. 'He should be freed immediately.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1mp7eg91e	2025-02-18T09:42:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/Sy37JEf9kx/Sy37JEf9kx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Miraculously, the crash resulted in no fatalities, with only 18 injured out of the 80 passengers and crew members on board. In one video from Toronto's Pearson International Airport, the plane is seen approaching the runway covered in heavy accumulated snow. Upon contact with the ground, sparks can be seen, followed by flames engulfing the aircraft, thick smoke rising, and then the plane flipping over. Another video, filmed by a passenger inside the plane, shows the evacuation process: a woman is seen exiting through the aisle, supported by people waiting outside, followed by the person filming. Once outside in the snow, the passenger looks around and exclaims, 'Oh my God! Wow, I was on that plane!' The plane is shown flipped on its back with some scorch marks, as more passengers continue to evacuate one by one. The crash occurred on Monday at 2:23 p.m. local time, at the end of an 86-minute flight from Minneapolis. The plane carried 76 passengers and four crew members. Only 18 were injured, three of them seriously, including a child. In total, 15 required hospitalization, though some were released home within several hours.

Following the incident, dozens of flights scheduled to depart from or land at Pearson Airport were delayed. Prior to the crash, there were already flight delays due to severe weather conditions and heavy snow in the area. Around the time of the crash-landing, the airport and its surroundings experienced strong winds and freezing temperatures. Over the past few days, a snowstorm has hit the region, resulting in 8.6 inches of snow accumulating at the airport. One of the passengers, John Nelson, who shared a video of the crash aftermath, told CNN that there was no indication of anything wrong before landing. 'We hit the ground and then flipped over,' he said. 'I managed to release my seatbelt and kind of fell and pushed myself toward the ground. People were sort of hanging and needed help to get down, while others managed to get down on their own.' Michael J. McCormick, an aviation management expert, stated that a situation in which a plane flips completely and lands on its roof is extremely rare. He emphasized that the fact that 80 people survived such an event is a testament to the advancements in aviation engineering and technology. According to him, not long ago, an incident like this would have resulted in multiple fatalities. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1uubvg91x	2025-02-18T09:23:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/SJivBbM5yl/SJivBbM5yl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu confidant Ron Dermer to lead Phase II of cease-fire, ho...	He will replace the heads of the Shin Bet and Mossad, according to a political source; Hamas will free 6 living hostages on Saturday as Israel opens negotiations on the next phase, which will end the war; 'We have raised demands based on the goals of the war - if Hamas refuses we will return to fighting in a forceful and deadly manner, and with full backing from Trump' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has appointed his close confidant, Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, to lead negotiations on the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage-return deal, alongside President Donald Trump's special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. Prior to this, Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and Mossad chief Dedi Barnea led the talks. After the announcement that the last six living hostages set to be released in Phase I - Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, Tal Shoham, Eliya Cohen, Avraham Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed - would be freed on Saturday, an Israeli official said Wednesday evening that this was 'an important achievement by Netanyahu, which was done in full coordination with the United States.' The same source said that 'the prime minister once again managed to shorten the pace of the release and reach an agreement on the return of all the living hostages for Phase I as early as this week, in addition to the return of the dead hostages. If the agreement is realized, Israel will complete Phase I of the agreement and guarantee the return of all the hostages from this stage, an achievement that not many thought would happen.' He said that as part of the negotiations, Israel had approved allowing 'only a small number' of caravans and heavy equipment into Gaza. 'This will in no way change the feasibility of implementing Trump's plan for voluntary immigration and creating another Gaza, to which Prime Minister Netanyahu is fully committed,' he claimed. The source added that Israel will enter negotiations on Phase II in the coming days, which is - as he put it - 'a political phase that deals with the question of the conditions for ending the war. Accordingly, the one who will lead the efforts on behalf of Israel is the Minister of Strategic Affairs, Ron Dermer, and he will do so with the U.S. president's special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff.' He further noted that 'Israel will raise its security demands during the negotiations, based on the war goals determined by the political-security cabinet. If Israel is forced to return to fighting in Gaza in light of Hamas' refusal, it will do so forcefully and lethally and with the full backing of the Trump administration, a renewed stockpile of weapons that has been released, fresh forces and a completely different way of fighting.' The source's announcement came after the breakthrough achieved Tuesday, in which Hamas agreed to release the six remaining living hostages as part of Phase I on Saturday. In addition, on Thursday, Hamas will return four dead hostages - with four more dead to be returned in another round of relelases next week. Israel has been pressing in recent days to bring forward the release of the live hostages; according to the original outline, only three were supposed to be released on Saturday and another three next week Sources among the mediators told the Wall Street Journal that this was made possible after Israel agreed to open negotiations on Phase II and to allow the entry of caravans to provide shelter for displaced Gazans. In recent days, there has been talk in Israel that hundreds of caravans will be agreed upon, even though the original agreement stipulated that 60,000 caravans (in addition to 200,000 tents) would enter Gaza in Phase I. Hamas has so far accused Israel of violating the agreement due to the delay in providing shelters for the displaced, and the caravan issue was at the center of the crisis last week. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: For Hamas, the advance release of the living hostages is also a prelude to Israel's release of Palestinian terrorists: Hamas claimed Tuesday evening that 602 Palestinian prisoners will be released on Saturday. Some 445 of them are residents of the Gaza Strip who were arrested after October 7, 50 who were sentenced to life imprisonment, 60 who were sentenced to long prison sentences, and 47 who were released in the Shalit deal. Another 108 prisoners will be deported to Egypt as a first stop, before being transferred to other countries, including 13 prisoners who suffer from serious medical problems. Negotiations on Phase II of the deal are expected to be very complicated, and Israel has already made it clear that it will demand the demilitarization of the Strip and a guarantee that Hamas will not be able to control it. Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said that Israel will demand in the negotiations that the Palestinian Authority also not be present in the Strip 'the day after.' Hamas has signaled that it will agree to formally give up control of the Gaza government, but according to estimates it is not expected to make demands such as disarmament or the exile of its leaders - so it is unclear how an agreement can be reached on Phase II, in which all the remaining living hostages are supposed to be released. Trump's envoy to the region, Witkoff, made it clear that the U.S. is determined to reach the second phase . 'We intend to succeed, we are leaving no one behind,' he said Sunday night at an event in Miami alongside captivity survivor Noa Argamani. So far, as part of Phase I of the deal, 19 Israeli hostages have been released and, in addition - as part of a separate agreement with the Thai government - five Thai citizens who were kidnapped on October 7 have also been released. After the release of the remaining 14 hostages as part of Phase I - six living who will be released on Saturday and eight dead who will be released in two additional stages on Thursday and next week - 59 hostages will remain in Gaza, including at least 28 dead hostages. The dead who remain in Gaza after Phase I are supposed to be handed over to Israel as part of the deal's outline only in Phase III, which also includes the long-term reconstruction of the Strip. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkd5urmqke	2025-02-18T09:05:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/03/BJcMzhROyl/BJcMzhROyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Fearing it would lose a drone inside Lebanese territory, the IDF launched an interceptor on the day its forces withdrew from most of southern Lebanon An interceptor was launched Tuesday afternoon from the Mount Hermon area, apparently targeting an Israeli Air Force drone that experienced a malfunction and was at risk of crashing in Lebanese territory. The incident occurred on the same day the IDF completed its full withdrawal from nearly all of southern Lebanon. After a two-month cease-fire and an extension, the last remaining Israeli troops are expected to finalize their withdrawal — except from five strategic locations. Earlier in the day, Lebanese media released footage showing IDF troops preparing controlled demolitions in villages they were vacating. Meanwhile, the Lebanese military began moving into the devastated areas left behind by withdrawing Israeli forces.

US, Russia agree to restore diplomatic missions	The U.S. and Russia agreed on Tuesday to restore the normal functioning of each other's diplomatic missions, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said after talks between senior U.S. and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia. The move appeared to signal a significant easing of restrictions on Russian diplomatic missions in the United States that were imposed by past U.S. administrations over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and other Russian actions. The Riyadh talks were aimed as a step toward ending Russia's war in Ukraine after President Donald Trump, who took office last month, ordered top officials to begin negotiations. Rubio said the sides agreed as a first step to appoint teams of officials to 'work very quickly to re-establish the functionality of our respective missions.' The two countries have expelled diplomats and limited the appointment of new staff at each other's missions in a series of tit-for-tat measures over the past decade, leaving their respective embassies thinly staffed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rylesvgqjx	2025-02-18T07:53:51-08:00

Former chief rabbi Yona Metzger investigated for indecent act wit...	Metzger, previously convicted of bribery and fraud, is being investigated for a new complaint of indecent acts involving a minor; Police are also revisiting past sexual misconduct allegations, though no formal charges have been filed Former Chief Rabbi Yona Metzger was questioned on Tuesday on suspicion of committing an indecent act against a minor under the age of 16. The investigation against Metzger, a 71-year-old resident of Tel Aviv, was initiated by the Fraud Unit of the Tel Aviv District Police following a complaint received by the police. In November 2020, Metzger was investigated on suspicion of sexual offenses, but the case was closed by the prosecution. On Tuesday, he was questioned again regarding that case as well as a new complaint received recently. At the end of the investigation, Metzger was released on bail, and the investigation into his case is ongoing. Metzger’s questioning coincided with Election Day for the Chief Rabbinate Council. In the past, he was convicted as part of a plea deal for bribery and fraud offenses and was sentenced to prison. Additionally, he was fined $1.4 million. During his tenure as Chief Rabbi of Israel, from 2003 to 2013, and subsequent to that, Metzger allegedly accepted significant financial benefits from private individuals in exchange for actions related to his position, according to the indictment. These benefits were received on numerous occasions, both during private events and as compensation for his participation in events organized by those providing the benefits. For example, during the wedding of his son in July 2010, financial benefits were allegedly provided. In a conversation that took place before the wedding between Metzger's driver and two invited guests, it was agreed that the two individuals would provide a substantial benefit to Metzger in the form of a 'gift' for the wedding. Accordingly, a payment of $500,000 was transferred directly to Metzger in ten cash installments. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: While serving as Chief Rabbi of Israel, allegations of sexual harassment against Metzger were published in the media. Reports at the time included testimonies from men who had met with him and claimed that he had touched them against their will. However, this information was never filed with the police as an official complaint and was not investigated. At the time, Metzger’s associates claimed he had undergone polygraph tests at two separate institutions and was found truthful. 'Prominent rabbinical figures are willing to stoop to any level, fabricating blatant lies and false accusations. After failing with allegations regarding women, they moved on to allegations concerning men, and the next step will likely involve accusations concerning animals,' an associate said. 'Only a police investigation will expose those behind these complaints and reveal the truth.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h15ptxzqje	2025-02-18T07:37:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/03/06/9103217/9103217_0_0_1280_853_0_small.jpg

South Tel Aviv residents petition court to end Eritrean asylum-se...	Petition to the Jerusalem District Court calls to end policy and deport regime supporters, citing evidence that many Eritreans have returned home safely Dozens of South Tel Aviv residents, along with the Israeli Immigration Policy Center, have filed a precedent-setting petition with the Jerusalem District Court demanding the cancellation of Israel’s group protection policy for Eritrean asylum-seekers and the deportation of regime supporters. The petition follows a report by Ynet that revealed an 80,000-shekel bond paid by the Eritrean Embassy in Israel to secure the release of pro-regime detainees — raising serious doubts about claims that Eritreans face danger if they return to their home country. The petition argues that for nearly 20 years Israel has allowed thousands of Eritrean asylum-seekers to stay, despite evidence that many have returned to Eritrea safely. According to data from the Population and Immigration Authority cited in the petition, more than 4,000 asylum-seekers have returned home with state assistance. The petitioners claim the group protection policy is illegal, 'contrary to common sense,' and lacks any legal foundation. The petitioners point to what they call the absurdity of the policy, highlighted by violent clashes between pro- and anti-regime Eritreans in September 2023. Despite openly declaring their support for the regime — from which they supposedly fled — pro-regime asylum-seekers were released from detention. One notable case mentioned is that of Eritrean national Dawit Debes, who admitted in court that he came to Israel for work, supports the Eritrean regime, and only remained due to financial constraints, not security concerns. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Following Ynet's exposé, the petitioners demanded the re-detention and deportation of pro-regime asylum-seekers, arguing that their release was unlawful and that the group protection policy itself contradicts Israeli law. They further allege that the policy has allowed violent criminals to be released without proper risk assessments and has encouraged migrants from other African countries to pose as Eritreans to secure protected status. Meanwhile, Knesset member Yulia Malinovsky of the Yisrael Beiteinu party has advanced a bill to deport regime-supporting asylum-seekers. The bill passed a preliminary reading in the Knesset last week with 51 votes in favor and none opposed. 'The first step toward restoring security and peace for South Tel Aviv residents began today,' Malinovsky said after the vote. 'Israeli citizens should not have to fear leaving their homes after dark. I visited South Tel Aviv this week and saw the chaos firsthand. Pro-regime Eritrean asylum-seekers are the main drivers of crime in the area. They are here as asylum seekers while supporting the regime — so there is no threat to their safety if they return home.' According to the proposed legislation, an asylum-seeker who directly or indirectly supports their home country's regime could be deported if the interior minister is convinced of their affiliation after giving them a chance to respond. Attorney Yonatan Jakubowicz, founder of the Israeli Immigration Policy Center and one of the petition’s initiators, said: 'It’s time to end this outrageous absurdity, enforce the law, and restore logic to Israel's immigration policy. The state has documented conversations with hundreds of infiltrators who returned to Eritrea and confirmed they were not harmed. The fact that pro-regime supporters are being released based on a supposed fear of persecution while their own government posts bail for them is the height of absurdity. We hope the court will order their deportation, bringing back some sense of security to South Tel Aviv residents and strengthening the rule of law in Israel.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sywcgkg51e	2025-02-18T06:11:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/09/02/B1grOngR3/B1grOngR3_0_133_2560_1442_0_small.jpg

Older brothers of captives Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Eviater David say watching hostages unite with their families prompts mixed emotions and joy will never be complete until both little brothers return Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Eviater David have been best friends from early childhood. They were at the Nova music festival when the Hamas massacre began on Oct. 7, they hid together, were discovered by the terrorists together and were abducted by together to Gaza. Gal, Guy's brother was also at Nova. He managed to escape. Now he and Eviatar's brother Ilay, see it as their life's mission to bring their younger brothers back home. 'We are now connected by our common goal and it is the strongest connection possible,' they say. 'We are fighting for the lives of our little brothers.' Ilay travels around the country to meet Israelis who do not come to Hostage square. He speaks of the abduction and of Ron Tzarfati and Idan Haramati, also friends, who were murdered in the massacre. Gal focuses on the international arena. 'We each do what we can do best,' Gal says. Now both are in the United States to meet with officials in the administration and urge them to push for a completion of the cease-fire deal. 'We understood that that is where we should concentrate our efforts.' Their journey has made the two older brothers very close. 'Of all the family members we are the most connected,' Gal says. 'Sometimes we talk about what we would do if one of them returns first. Even if we could be certain that the other would follow, it would be insanely tough. We don't want half of a celebration. We want real happiness, knowing they are both home and we can begin to heal.' From the evidence they had gathered, Gal and Ilay now know that Guy and Eviatar reached their car when the terrorists were already battling police forces and were in the line of fire. 'The managed to reach the open fields past highway 232 but had to abandon their car when they came under gunfire from terrorists. There were people there who were running and falling, and the two friends were able to help some of them escape until they themselves were shot,' Gal says.

Ilay adds that they were there for over an hour. 'They heard and saw everything. The masses of terrorists, the screams, shootings explosions,' he says. 'At 9:30 AM they were discovered, bound, blindfolded and put on a pick up that took them to Gaza. By 11 AM, a video of them inside the Strip, already spread on social media.' The cease-fire deal is critical to both. 'I always try to be realistic,' Gal says. 'With all the pain involved, I understood that the two would not be included in the first phase of the deal because they are young men who would be considered worthwhile assets to Hamas.' But watching hostages reunite with their families has prompted mixed emotions. 'There are days that are more difficult, and I struggle to function,' Gal says. 'I am happy and also angry.

Cleaning house: Musk fires FDA employees overseeing Neuralink	Cutting comes as part of Musk's U.S. Department of Government Efficiency position aimed at improving processes under Trump's new administration Several U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) employees who reviewed Elon Musk’s brain implant company, Neuralink, were fired over the weekend as part of a broader federal workforce purge led by the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which Musk heads. Two sources told Reuters that about 20 employees from the FDA’s office of neurological and physical medicine devices, some involved with Neuralink-related matters, were among those let go. However, the sources did not believe the employees were targeted specifically for their work on Neuralink approvals. The cuts raised concerns about the FDA’s ability to efficiently and safely process medical device applications, including those from Neuralink. 'It’s intimidating to the FDA professionals who are overseeing Neuralink’s trial,' said Victor Krauthamer, a former acting director in the agency’s brain implant trials division. 'We should be worried about the whole trial, and the protection of the people in the trial,' he added. The FDA, the White House and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Musk, who spent over $250 million supporting U.S. President Donald Trump’s reelection bid, has led efforts to slash government spending, including at agencies regulating his companies like Tesla and SpaceX. His involvement in mass federal layoffs and access to federal databases have sparked criticism, particularly from Democrats, who accused him of lacking transparency regarding his businesses while shutting down agencies such as USAID, which resulted in halting HIV medication shipments to third-world countries. Trump, asked multiple times about Musk’s role, assured that Musk would address any conflicts of interest. The two developed a close relationship during his election campaign. Reports even suggested Musk had moved into a rental home linked to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The layoffs affected FDA scientists reviewing experimental medical device applications. Employees on probation — typically with less than one or two years of service — were hit hardest, as they have fewer legal protections. Neuralink is testing its brain implant, which would allow paralyzed patients to control digital devices with their thoughts. The company is also developing an implant to restore vision. Last year, the FDA designated the device for expedited review. Musk previously announced the first implantation of Neuralink’s chip in a human, although months later, the company reported electrode malfunctions reducing signal reception. 'The chip would enable control of your phone or computer, and through them almost any device, just by thinking,' Musk said. 'Initial users will be those who have lost the use of their limbs.' Neuralink received FDA approval for its first human clinical trial in May 2023. A month later, Musk said the company planned to implant its chip in a quadriplegic patient. He previously demonstrated successful implantation in a monkey, saying the animal could play video games using only its mind. The FDA termination letters cited performance-related reasons, though the employees had received top evaluations weeks earlier, according to sources. Musk’s team did not consult the FDA managers of the fired employees, who only learned about the dismissals afterward. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1r0jtw51e	2025-02-18T01:34:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/02/01/r1QD8Fjuca/r1QD8Fjuca_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
We're here for you': Israeli project provides therapy for Jews a...	Planetherapy, launched by Ilana O’Malley after the Hamasmassacre gives Jews and Israelis abroad who are affected, the help they need to face trauma and restore mental health In the wake of Hamas’ October 7 attacks, Ilana O’Malley, founder of Planetherapy, saw the urgent need for emotional support. Initially, she made phone calls to comfort those affected, including a friend’s daughter whose boyfriend went missing after the Nova music festival massacre. During one such call, O’Malley’s husband, who doesn’t speak Hebrew, unexpectedly joined the conversation. 'Oh, hello,' he said, unaware of the gravity of the situation. Yet, his presence had a profound impact, showing the power of human connection. As he spoke, the girl straightened up and started talking. A mission born from tragedy 'I looked at my husband and he was sweating. He said to me, ‘Oh my God, I get it now. I understand.’' The moment inspired O’Malley to gather professional therapists from around the world to offer support. 'It just started with, ‘Let’s get five people,’ and it went viral. Now we have hundreds of therapists from 35 countries, speaking 22 languages — Jews, non-Jews, Israelis living abroad. It’s amazing.' One of Planetherapy’s therapists, London-based psychologist Bat-Chen Shahar offers speech therapy tailored to individual needs. 'I was trained in Israel, but I’ve been in London for the last eight years,' she said. 'Therapy really depends on the specific client and what they need, but usually it’s around trauma. Sometimes it’s something directly from October 7 or it’s something from before that has resurfaced. Everything just feels too much.' O’Malley noted an increasing demand for mental health services, citing Israeli reports marking a 900% rise in cases. 'We spoke about it last night in one of our group sessions. I keep seeing articles from Israel on the rise of the mental health crisis. Channel 13 reported a 900% increase.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Despite this, many people remain unaware of Planetherapy’s services. 'It’s crucial to spread the word. We’re here for you. We’re giving six sessions for free and even after that, it’s so cheap — only 25 euros.' Sessions are available in multiple languages, including Hebrew and English, catering to Israelis and Jewish communities abroad. 'Even if they haven’t reached out to us yet, we want them to know we’re here whenever they’re ready.' Shahar stressed that Planetherapy serves as a reminder that people are fundamentally good and willing to support one another. 'We want to connect. We are here for each other, regardless of where you are, what language you speak, what your religion is or where you live. Planetherapy is a place where you can speak about everything.' Planetherapy benefits from the expertise of Prof. Craig Katz, a mental health professional with experience from the 9/11 terror attack. 'In our first conversation, he told me, ‘Wow, you’re throwing me back to 23 years ago.’ And I said, ‘Craig, you know what? We’re going to be your little sisters. Just guide us and tell us how to do it.’' Katz advised a step-by-step approach, cautioning against rushing to help everyone at once. 'When you’re a therapist, you want to help everybody. You want to go big. But he keeps me grounded — ‘Slow down. Step by step. Make sure it’s perfect.’' O’Malley, who resides in Spain, actively promotes Planetherapy worldwide. 'I speak everywhere — even when I go in the sauna!' she laughed. 'I was going to talk about the leaders of Spain — the King and everyone.' She also met with Spain’s leadership, including King Felipe VI, who deeply acknowledged the impact of the attacks. 'He was lovely. He actually said the names of the Spanish-speaking people who were killed on October 7. I was blown away by how much he knew and how he spoke about it in front of everyone. His heart was with us. It was really felt.' With hundreds of therapists volunteering from around the world, Planetherapy continues to expand its reach. O’Malley and Shahar remain committed to ensuring those affected by trauma receive the support they need, wherever they are. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bk600r0w5kx	2025-02-18T01:27:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/B1gkYRZ5ke/B1gkYRZ5ke_88_0_346_195_0_small.jpg

Terror group demands heavy equipment, caravans enter Strip; cabinet decides to concentrate on completing 1st phase and not to mandate delegation to move toward the second phase since there is no agreement among ministers regarding an end to the war A Hamas official six Israeli hostages would be freed on Saturday. The official told Ynet that the decision depends on what price Israel was willing to pay. 'Our demand now is that Israel enters phase two negotiations and commits to the humanitarian protocol including caravans and heavy machinery into the Strip.' According to the official the commitment must come from the Egyptian and Qatari mediators. But the security cabinet in its meeting late on Monday, decided to concentrate on completing the first phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal and not to mandate the Israeli delegation to the negotiations to move toward the second phase because there is no agreement among ministers regarding an end to the war. The delegation was given a 'general mandate' to prevent the first phase from being disrupted. Israel is seeking a weeks-long extension of the phase. Arab media reported that heavy equipment began moving from Egypt toward the Kerem Shalom border crossing into Gaza. They are meant to be used to remove rubble and open roads. Egyptian media said the heavy machinery was destined for the rebuilding of Gaza and would enter the Strip through the Rafah crossing. Israel has not confirmed the reports. Hamas was expected to transfer the remains of four dead hostages on Thursday, through the Red Cross. At least three live hostages are to be released on Saturday but Israel has sought to increase that number to six. In exchange Israel would allow caravans in, that could house Gaza residents whose homes were destroyed in the war.

Free my brother, bring Matan home'	Moshe Or, brother of hostage, travels the world, meeting officials and activists in France, England, and even Qatar to push for Avinatan’s release. 'This has become my real job now, he says. 'I’ll do whatever it takes.' Moshe Or remembers Oct. 7, 2023, with painful clarity. It was supposed to be a day of joy, Simchat Torah, a holiday celebrating faith and tradition. Instead, it became a day of horror for his family. As news of that day’s attacks in southern Israel trickled in, he had no idea that his brother, Avinatan Or, was at the Nova music festival, one of the first targets of the Hamas assault. The first sign that something was wrong came through social media. Friends were searching for Avinatan. Frantic, Moshe scoured Instagram and Telegram, joining Hamas-linked channels in a desperate bid for information. Hours later, his worst fears were confirmed—a video emerged showing his brother being taken hostage. 'I saw this video, and then I realized that Avinatan was kidnapped,' Moshe recalls. A Life Full of Promise Avinatan, now 32, is an electrical engineer, a graduate of Ben-Gurion University, and an employee at Nvidia. He is a family man, a devoted uncle, and a passionate cook who delights in preparing elaborate dishes. 'He never misses a family event,' Moshe says. 'No matter how far he has to travel, he is always there.' Avinatan and his girlfriend, Noa Argamani, had spent the night before the attack at her father’s home in Be’er Sheva before heading to the Nova festival. Both were kidnapped and taken to Gaza. While Noa was later rescued, Avinatan remains in captivity. 'The video of the kidnapping is also the last moment Noa saw Avinatan,' Moshe shares. 'When she was released, we came to her and we wanted to hear if she saw Avinatan. And she really wanted to hear if we had any information about him.' Since her release, Noa has become an outspoken advocate for the remaining hostages, tirelessly meeting world leaders in an effort to secure their freedom. A Family’s Struggle The Or family is large and deeply connected. With seven siblings, their home is always full—especially on Shabbat, with big meals and lively conversations. But since Oct. 7, 2023, their lives have been consumed by a different kind of gathering: a campaign to bring Avinatan home. Moshe has traveled extensively, meeting officials and activists in France, England, and even Qatar to push for his brother’s release. 'This has become my real job now,' he admits. 'I’ll do whatever it takes.' Their efforts have been met with frustration. The families of male hostages have been largely sidelined in the current negotiations, leaving them in a painful limbo. 'People talk about ‘Phase A’ and ‘Phase B’ of the hostage release deals, but it’s not true. There is no ‘Phase B.’ There is no plan in place for the young men still held captive,' Moshe says. 'They don’t talk about them. It really stresses us out.' Moshe also highlights a troubling reality: 'Nobody knows where the young men are. Nobody. We have no information. It’s as if they have disappeared. And that is the most terrifying part—there are no details, no updates, just silence.' A Message of Hope Despite the uncertainty, Moshe refuses to lose hope. 'Avinatan, if you can hear me, know that we are fighting for you. You will be released—it’s just a matter of time. Stay strong. Keep your head up. Imagine the moment you return home—what you’ll eat, who you’ll hug, the joy that awaits you. That day will come.' 'I want you to think about how your release day will look like,' Moshe continues, directing his words toward his brother. 'What will you wear on your release day? Who will you meet? What will you say to people? How will mom react when she sees you? What food do you want her to cook for you? What beer do you want to drink? What kind of meat do you want on the grill? Think about all these things, let them occupy your mind, and they will give you strength,' Moshe continues. As global negotiations continue, Moshe’s message to world leaders is clear: 'There is no price too high for their freedom. The Israeli government must do whatever it takes. We won’t stop fighting until every last hostage is home.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He also places hope in international intervention, particularly in the United States. 'We really hope that [US President] Trump will help us,' Moshe says. 'We hear his rhetoric. It’s very militant, and he wants the deal to be signed and all the hostages to return.' The Or family’s struggle is far from over, but they remain united in their determination. 'We are strong because we have to be,' Moshe says. 'For Avinatan, for all the families waiting for their loved ones—we won’t give up.'

Turkish police detained 282 suspected members of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, militant group in raids over the last five days, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on Tuesday. The raids came as Turkey continues to remove elected pro-Kurdish mayors from their posts over militant ties in a crackdown coinciding with hopes for an end to a 40-year conflict between the PKK and authorities. Jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is expected to make a statement on such efforts, four months after an ally of President Tayyip Erdogan urged him to call on the militants to lay down their arms. Police carried out this week's counter-terror raids in 51 provinces, as well as in the capital, Ankara, and the largest city of Istanbul, the minister said on X. The suspects were accused of conducting PKK propaganda, providing financing for the group, recruiting members and joining in street protests, he said. The police seized two AK 47 rifles among other weapons.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1gbas11qyx	2025-02-17T21:49:56-08:00	
IDF to withdraw from South Lebanon, keeping military presence in ...	Troops continued to destroy terror infrastructure along the border; military deployment along the frontier, three times larger than before the war; IDF says Hezbollah increasing efforts to launch drones for intelligence purposes The IDF will on Tuesday complete its withdrawal from Lebanon under the terms of the cease-fire agreement, leaving forces in five strategic locations, with the approval of the United States. As forces left South Lebanon villages, the Lebanese army was seen taking up positions. Forces continued their lastminute efforts to destroy remaining Hezbollah infrastructure in the morning hours after a car loaded with explosives was discovered on Thursday, likely to be used against the IDF during their ground offensive. The car was buried under the rubble of a building that was bombed earlier on in the fighting. The IDF does not anticipate an immediate Hezbollah response to the pullback because of the positions that the military would hold on to, to protect the Israeli communities on the border. But the military says provocations such as Hezbollah flag r aisings are to be expected and would be responded to if there is any danger to the troops. The IDF deployed a significant military presence to the border area, three times the size of the force that was there before the war. This is expected to provide some sense of security for residents returning to the north after nearly a year and a half away. 'We are determined to foil any effort to reconstruct infrastructure of bring in armaments that would allow Hezbollah to rebuild its military capabilities,' the IDF said.

Preparation s for next hostage releases including remains	Bodies of four to be delivered by Hamas to the Red Cross before tranfer to Israel for positive identification; Cabinet convenes to discuss cease-fire's second phase including an end to the war and return of all live hostages Israel is preparing for the next releases of hostages as the first phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal nears its completion. Six live hostages and eight bodies are expected to be returned. On Thursday, Israel will receive the bodies of four of the hostages who have not survived and on Saturday, at least three live hostages would be freed, although negotiations are continuing for the release of a total of six live hostages. If that is not accomplished, three more would be freed the following week. The remains of the hostages would be examined for DNA before they are returned. Hamas will deliver the remains to the Red Cross who will transfer them to the IDF. Official announcement would not be made before a positive identification is complete although Hamas is likely to release their identity earlier. When identification is completed, the bodies would be then prepared for burial either by the military rabbinate or the Religious Affairs Ministry. Among the remaining hostages included in the first phase of the deal are two civilians who crossed into Gaza on their own volition over a decade ago and have been held since by Hamas. They are Avera Mengiso and Hisham a Sayad. There are four hostages abducted in the Oct. 7 massacre who are either injured or ill: Omer Wenkert, Eliya Cohen, Omer Shem Tov and Tal Shoham.

Also named were Ohad Yahalomi, Oded Lifshitz and Tsahi Idan. Under the terms of the cease-fire deal, negotiations for the second phase were already to begin. Israel denied that they had been in process but on Monday the security cabinet met to discuss the next phase after U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff revealed that they had begun. Witkoff said in an interview with Fox News that the talks would continue for a week at a location to be determined. The second phase of the deal includes an end to the war and a complete withdrawal of troops in exchange for the return of all of the live hostages including the IDF soldiers being held by Hamas. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy8ft511qyg	2025-02-17T20:34:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/SylidNql9kg/SylidNql9kg_0_308_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

U.S. official: All hostages will leave Gaza under Trump	Exclusive: All of the hostages will be coming out of Gaza, as per U.S. President Donald Trump’s instruction ILTV News had a conversation on the sidelines of the events happening in Israel this week with a senior U.S. official who shared that, despite all the discussions about going back into Gaza and the Phase I and Phase II negotiations, all of the hostages will be coming out of Gaza, as per U.S. President Donald Trump’s instruction. The message received was clear: When Trump means business, he means business—this is non-negotiable. So, Israelis can feel confident that their loved ones will come home. Period. Over the weekend, Trump told reporters, 'If it was up to me, I would take a very hard stance, but I can't tell you what Israel is going to do.' However, before taking office, Trump vowed that every hostage would leave Gaza or 'hell would break loose.' When Hamas threatened to cancel the hostage deal, Trump issued an ultimatum that forced the organization back into compliance. Since November, when Israel secured the release of around 115 hostages as part of the first hostage-for-ceasefire deal, negotiations with Hamas have stalled. The remaining captives have now been in the terror group’s hands for more than 500 days. Currently, 73 hostages remain in Gaza, including some who are confirmed dead. Among them are American citizens. Israel is expected to receive four bodies on Thursday and three live hostages on Saturday. A report by The Jerusalem Post indicated that more than three hostages might be released on Saturday, citing an Israeli official.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkm2itzq1g	2025-02-17T19:13:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/S1Vs86bWqyg/S1Vs86bWqyg_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Israel is exhausted, traumatized, and still fighting'	Fleur Hassan-Nahoum describes situation in Israel as one of trauma, exhaustion, sadness, and disbelief The Israeli people are suffering from trauma and disbelief that, more than 500 days after the worst attack ever seen on Israeli sovereign territory, the hostages remain in captivity and the war against Hamas continues, according to Fleur Hassan-Nahoum, former deputy mayor of Jerusalem. 'There are still hostages that haven't returned home,' Hassan-Nahoum told ILTV. 'Hamas is still on its feet. It's almost unbelievable that we've destroyed, practically destroyed, Hezbollah, the Syrian government of [Bashar] Assad has toppled down, and yet here we still are trying to get our hostages home.'

How did American Jewish leaders react to Netanyahu?	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a powerful message on Sunday to the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a powerful message on Sunday to the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. He emphasized that Israel is stronger than ever and expressed full support for U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan for Gaza and the region. 'We see eye to eye with the US administration, with President Trump and his administration, first of all, on accomplishing the immediate three goals that we have in Gaza,' Netanyahu said. 'One is to achieve the release of all our hostages. The second, as I said, is to destroy Hamas. The third is to ensure that Gaza has a different future.' The prime minister added that 'President Trump has presented a bold new vision, and the only plan that I think can work to enable a different future for the people of Gaza, for the people of Israel, for the surrounding areas, why not give Gazans a choice?' Netanyahu highlighted Israel’s successes in Lebanon and Syria but acknowledged that more work remains in Gaza, likely referencing his earlier discussions with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, signaling that Israel may need to return to Gaza in the near future to fully eliminate Hamas, which still controls the territory. He also delivered strong remarks on Iran, calling it the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism. 'The greatest threat that Iran poses is that this decrepit regime would have achieved nuclear weapons, and we are committed, as President Trump has said many times, and as Secretary Rubio said today, we are committed that Iran never gets nuclear weapons,' Netanyahu said. The prime minister left the room energized and committed to working with Israel to turn this vision into reality. 'The prime minister coming here is an indication of his commitment to maintaining the dialog and making his voice heard and helping to explain the policies to the leadership of the American Jewish community,' said Malcom Honlein, former CEO of the Conference of Presidents. 'I believe we are on the cusp of major changes in the Middle East.' Former Trump antisemitism envoy Elan Carr said, 'I think the Prime Minister is 100% correct to say we stand with the United States and with President Trump in this bold new vision of the Middle East.' The five day conference brought around 65 delegates to Israel, fewer than in recent years, but including top leaders from North America's Jewish community. Along with site visits, delegates will meet with Genesis speaker Amir Ohana and other MKS to discuss key issues important to us Jews. 'What's weighing on the American Jewish community ... is number one, is making sure that the hostages can be brought home,' Deborah Lust Zaluda, chair of JNF-USA told ILTV. 'Also, how is the country going to come back from this? And what can we do to help that country come back from this?'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjxxltwqyg	2025-02-17T18:51:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/SJGvfYb9ye/SJGvfYb9ye_0_399_2048_1153_0_small.jpg
500 days of war: The cost, the silence and the fight ahead	Comment: Let’s not forget the Houthis, Islamic Jihadists in Iraq and Syria, and, of course, the head of the octopus—the Islamic Republic of Iran—which attacked Israel in the largest ballistic missile strike in history Monday marked 500 days of war. Five hundred days since our world was turned upside down. Let’s not forget how this war began. It began on October 7th, when Hamas broke the existing ceasefire, committing the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. 1,200 people—Israelis and nationals from countries around the world—were raped, tortured, and murdered. Hundreds were taken hostage into Gaza. Five hundred days later, 73 hostages remain in captivity, held in the darkest dungeons of Gaza. Without food. Without sunlight. Tortured. Injured. Their time is running out. Hamas orchestrated and perpetrated these acts, but it was not alone. Thousands of Palestinian civilians from Gaza also took part. And one day after October 7th, Israel was attacked again—this time from the north, by Hezbollah in Lebanon. And let’s not forget the Houthis, Islamic Jihadists in Iraq and Syria, and, of course, the head of the octopus—the Islamic Republic of Iran—which attacked Israel in the largest ballistic missile strike in history. And throughout this seven-front war—throughout Israel’s existential war—the world was silent. Silence from the United Nations. Silence from many Western leaders. Silence from human rights groups. Silence from women’s rights groups. Just silence. And worse than silence—condemnations. Condemnations from the UN. From kangaroo courts. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets—not to call for the release of the hostages. Not to demand that Hamas and Hezbollah surrender. No. But to accuse Israel of genocide. To call on Israel to stop defending itself. To lose this war. And with these calls—and the weak leadership displayed by world leaders—came the rise of antisemitism. The age-old phenomenon in a new form. And Jews are once again being targeted around the world—simply for being Jews. But despite all of this. Despite everything. In these 500 days of war, the IDF and Israel’s security forces launched incredible operations—who can forget the Be’eri attack? But these came at a heavy price. Over 800 soldiers—brothers, sons, husbands, fathers—killed in combat. We don’t forget their heroic sacrifices. For the most part, Israel has stood alone. It has had some help from allies—but not enough. And 500 days later, we continue to see the strength of the people of Israel. We see their resilience. Israel is beginning to rebuild. To rehabilitate. A change in leadership has finally brought the moral clarity that was so sorely lacking since October 7th. Our allies—especially the United States, led by President Donald Trump—are standing alongside Israel unequivocally and demanding change. Not from Israel, but from Hamas and its allies. Demanding an end to the status quo that brought us to this day. Five hundreds days in, we are in the midst of a ceasefire. The Axis of Resistance is severely weakened. But the war is far from over. It will not end—we will not be able to move on—until Israel sees the return of all the hostages and Hamas is eliminated once and for all. But 500 days later there is finally optimism. And there is hope.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkbctdz9kx	2025-02-17T18:33:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/06/ByCXmFe4Jl/ByCXmFe4Jl_0_166_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
He tried to finish us off,' say Israeli tourists attacked by Jew...	Ari and Yarin Rabey, a father and son on vacation in the US, narrowly escaped a shooting by a Jewish gunman who mistook them for Palestinians; 'He came toward us and fired 17 bullets—it felt like an eternity,' says Ari, 20, who was shot in the shoulder An Israeli father and son on vacation in Miami Beach narrowly escaped death when a gunman opened fire on their car, firing 17 bullets in what they initially believed was an antisemitic attack. Yarin and Ari Rabey, from Ra’anana, were driving through an upscale neighborhood on Saturday night when Mordechai Brafman, a 27-year-old Jewish man, overtook their vehicle, exited his truck, and began shooting. Ari, 20, was struck in the shoulder. Speaking from his hospital bed, he recounted the terrifying moments. 'The shooting lasted about a minute and a half. He came toward us and fired 17 bullets—it felt like an eternity,' he said. 'Two bullets grazed my father’s face. He tried to finish us off, approaching the car doors.' Brafman was arrested shortly after the shooting and told police: 'I killed two Palestinians.' Ari described the moments leading up to the attack, explaining that he and his father had stopped briefly to admire a mansion. 'We looked at it and said, ‘Wow, how gorgeous,’ and were there for about a minute. Suddenly, a massive truck appeared, overtook us, made a U-turn, and stopped in front of us,' he said. Sensing danger, Ari urged his father to drive forward. 'As we approached the truck, the driver opened the door and started shooting at us with an automatic weapon,' he said. The two managed to flee while under fire. 'When he started shooting at us, we jumped around inside the car. My father kept control of the wheel, driving onto sidewalks so the shooter wouldn’t be able to hit us. We hit speed bumps at 93 mph,' Ari recalled. Yarin, the father, described how he managed to accelerate away while lying low in the car. 'The smell of gunpowder filled the car. He chased us and fired two more bullets, which passed right by my head and, miraculously, didn’t hit me,' he said. After escaping, they sought help at a nearby hotel, but the staff refused to let them in upon seeing their bullet-riddled car. 'We ran down the street to another building, where a security guard armed with a weapon came out and protected us. Soon after, police and ambulances arrived and evacuated us to the hospital,' Ari said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: At first, the Rabeys had no idea why they had been targeted. Hours later, the FBI informed them that Brafman had been looking for Arabs and mistook them for Palestinians. 'They brought us into a room and were very kind,' Ari said. 'They explained that the shooter thought we were dead when he was arrested. He told the police, ‘I killed two Palestinians.’' Despite surviving, both father and son remain deeply shaken. 'I’m not okay; I’m terrified,' Ari said. 'A Jew almost killed me. No one should harm anyone, and no one has the right to take another person’s life—whether they’re Arab or Jewish. Someone tried to murder us, and we were given our lives back as a gift.' Yarin emphasized how close they came to being killed. 'This was an attack in every sense, even if it was a case of mistaken identity,' he said. 'It lasted a minute and a half—he was firing nonstop, and the smell of gunpowder filled the car. The fact that we survived 17 bullets from an automatic weapon is a miracle.' The two showed remarkable presence of mind during the attack. After fleeing, they abandoned the car and ran for help. 'During the attack, we ran toward a building we saw, but the security guard didn’t want to let us in because we were covered in blood and he was scared,' Yarin said. 'We ran to another building, where a security guard armed with a weapon came out and helped us get assistance.' He described the overwhelming trauma of the incident. 'We were absolutely terrified. I’m not in good mental shape and am traumatized by what we went through,' Yarin said. Ari echoed that sentiment. 'All the police officers said it’s unbelievable that we survived,' he said. 'The shooter fired 17 bullets at our car, and only one hit. It’s truly a miracle.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkktx411cyl	2025-02-17T15:37:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/Skx9O1xW9Je/Skx9O1xW9Je_0_433_480_271_0_small.jpg
Bring back my brother,' ex-hostage Iair Horn says in emotional p...	Two days after his release, Horn shares poignant video from hospital, pleading for 73 hostages still in Gaza, including his younger brother Eitan; 'The hostages have no time,' he says Iair Horn who was released from Hamas captivity on Saturday after 498 days, shared a video message on Monday evening in which he pleaded for the return of all hostages, including his younger brother Eitan. 'The hostages have no time,' the 46-year-old said in his first public remarks since being released from Gaza, where he was held in Hamas tunnels. 'I experienced it with my own body,' he added. 'I’m telling you—there’s no time for the hostages; we don’t have time. We must bring them back now.' Struggling to continue, Horn broke down in tears, pleading: 'Bring back my brother. Bring back my brother and all the hostages.' Horn was released alongside Sagui Dekel-Chen and Sasha Troufanov. His mother, Ruthie Strom, said Saturday that while she was relieved to see Iair, the family remains focused on securing Eitan’s release. 'Until Eitan and all the hostages are back, we keep going,' she said. 'Seeing Iair was amazing—I was so happy to see him on his feet. He’s a bit thin, but he’s here, and he’ll get the treatment he needs.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On the helicopter flight to Sourasky Medical Center, where he remains under medical supervision, Iair sent a message to his brother: 'Eitan, you’re next.' However, Ruthie noted that he had not yet spoken about his brother’s captivity. She described the emotional reunion between Iair and his other brother, Amos, saying, 'The moment they opened the door and we saw Iair, I stayed back a little because I wanted them to hug first.' The three brothers share a deep bond, she said, as fans of Hapoel Be’er Sheva and the Rolling Stones. In a statement following Iair’s release, the Horn family said, 'We can breathe a little now. Our Iair is home after surviving hell and torment in Gaza. Now we need to bring Eitan home so our family can truly breathe again.' They thanked IDF soldiers and security forces, expressed condolences to families who lost loved ones, and pledged to continue working to secure the release of all hostages. Horn, known as 'the beating heart' of Kibbutz Nir Oz, was born in Argentina and immigrated to Israel in 1999 with a group from the Habonim Dror youth movement. He moved to Nir Oz in 2014 during Operation Protective Edge and became a central figure in the community, managing the local pub and organizing events. He was abducted alongside Eitan, who had been visiting him for Simchat Torah. Eitan is set to be released in the second phase of the hostage deal. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjvmemwqye	2025-02-17T12:46:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/rJxkXe11Z9yg/rJxkXe11Z9yg_41_0_1006_566_0_small.jpg

Israeli ambassador accuses Egypt of violating peace treaty, raisi...	In rare accusation, Yechiel Leiter tells Jewish groups issue has been 'shoved to the side,' but Egypt’s military buildup in Sinai continues, with bases that 'can only be used for offensive operations'; video deleted amid growing concerns Israeli Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter accused Egypt of a 'very serious violation' of its peace treaty with Israel, stating that Jerusalem will soon raise concerns over Cairo’s military buildup. 'There are bases being built, and they can only be used for offensive operations and offensive weapons,' Leiter said. 'This is a clear violation. For a long time, this issue has been shoved to the side, but it continues. This is an issue that we are going to put on the table – very soon and very emphatically.' Leiter made the remarks late last month in a meeting with the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, shortly before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. A video of his comments was published last Friday but was later removed from online platforms. This marks the first time an Israeli official has publicly accused Egypt of violating the peace agreement by expanding its military presence in the Sinai Peninsula. In recent weeks, videos have circulated online showing Egyptian military vehicles deployed in northern Sinai near the border with Gaza. While the authenticity of some of these videos is unclear—some are reportedly old—their widespread dissemination has also drawn attention from Arab media. Prominent Egyptian television host Amr Adib addressed the growing speculation on his Al-Hekaya program on MBC Egypt on Sunday, dismissing claims that Egypt is preparing for war with Israel. 'No one wants to enter a war, but if we are forced to fight, we are ready,' he said. Meanwhile, Saudi broadcaster Al Arabiya recently published a report on the circulating videos, featuring comments from Egyptian military expert Mohammed Rifaat Jad. He stated that Egypt is reinforcing security along its borders in accordance with national security needs and existing threats. According to Jad, Egyptian reinforcements have been deployed periodically since the start of the war in Gaza, adding that military movements in Sinai fall under Egypt’s sovereign right to maintain internal stability. While he acknowledged that any deviation from established agreements could raise concerns for Israel, he emphasized that Cairo remains committed to the peace treaty and does not seek escalation in the region. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Former Israeli minister Yuval Steinitz, now chairman of defense contractor Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, warned last week about Egypt’s growing military capabilities, saying Israel should closely monitor the developments. 'There is definitely reason to view Egypt’s military buildup with concern,' Steinitz told Ynet. 'Relations between Israel and Egypt are currently stable, but if one day we become weak, everyone in the region will seize the opportunity.' David Govrin, Israel’s former ambassador to Egypt, has also previously raised alarms over Egypt’s expanding military infrastructure in Sinai. He detailed the expansion of military airfields east of Cairo, including in Sinai, Rafidim and El-Arish; the construction of new bunkers and ammunition depots; the doubling of fuel reserves; the building of seven tunnels under the Suez Canal—four near Ismailia and three near Port Said; and the widening of key roads in Sinai into highways, despite low civilian traffic in those areas. The concerns come as tensions between Israel and Egypt have intensified since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, particularly regarding the Philadelphi Corridor, where Egypt has demanded Israel withdraw its forces. Additionally, U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to relocate Palestinians to Egyptian territory has further strained relations between Jerusalem and Cairo. This is not the first time Israel has accused Egypt of violating the 1979 peace treaty. In 2012, Egypt deployed fighter jets and tanks into Sinai for the first time since the 1973 Yom Kippur War, a move that breached the Camp David Accords. At the time, Egypt denied violating the agreement, stating it remained committed to the peace treaty. Meanwhile, Leiter, who was appointed by Netanyahu after Donald Trump’s election, has also been vocal about Egyptian military expansion. Leiter, a former chief of staff to Netanyahu during his tenure as finance minister, was widely regarded as a skilled English-language spokesperson. Netanyahu initially sought to appoint Ron Dermer as ambassador, but he declined. The role was later offered to Netanyahu’s foreign policy adviser, Ophir Falk, who also turned it down. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skophmbcyg	2025-02-17T12:18:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/BJGNpZ11cyg/BJGNpZ11cyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Amid fragile truce, IDF division that led Gaza offensive prepares...	IDF’s 162nd Division hands control of northern Gaza’s security zone to 252nd Division, preparing for possible offensive if cease-fire talks fail; after 15 months of combat dismantling terror infrastructure, division now shifts to future missions The IDF 162nd Division formally transferred command of the security zone in northern Gaza to the 252nd Division on Monday, preparing for a possible offensive if talks on the next phases of the cease-fire agreement collapse, military sources told Ynet on Monday. The handover comes after 15 months of continuous combat operations since the IDF launched its ground offensive in Gaza on October 27, 2023. During its deployment, the 162nd Division played a key role in dismantling terrorist infrastructure, neutralizing terror tunnel shafts and eliminating thousands of terrorists, including many involved in the October 7 attacks. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The division suffered the loss of 265 soldiers and commanders in combat. 'The IDF embraces the bereaved families and will continue to accompany them,' the military said in a statement. With the transition of command, the 162nd Division will now prepare for future missions based on operational requirements and political decisions. While the troop rotation does not necessarily indicate an imminent escalation, it underscores serious preparations. The shift follows an extended high-level meeting last Thursday at IDF Southern Command, attended by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Israel Katz, outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, incoming Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir, Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar and other senior officials. The meeting, which lasted over six hours, focused on detailing new war plans. Security officials say that if fighting resumes, the IDF is expected to operate with even greater intensity, without munitions restrictions and with full U.S. backing. Despite the military's failure to dismantle Hamas’ armed wing after more than a year of operations, officials remain confident in the updated strategy. 'With a new plan and no limitations, we will achieve our objectives,' a military source said. Brig. Gen. Itzik Cohen, the division’s commanding officer, reflected on its achievements: 'For 15 months, we fought on the frontlines of the IDF’s war—engaging in fierce combat deep within terror strongholds with unmatched determination. The 162nd Division has always been, and will always remain, at the forefront of the IDF, ready for any challenge. 'Throughout our journey, we carried with us the memory of the soldiers and commanders who fell—they were our spirit and gave us the strength to keep fighting. Alongside those we lost, we embrace the wounded—those who gave their bodies and souls for Israel’s security. We honor their strength, their resilience, and their daily struggle. You, the soldiers and commanders who fought with bravery—you are the victory generation.' Meanwhile, Steven Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, signaled that the White House supports transitioning to the next phase of negotiations to secure the release of all remaining hostages. Witkoff previously said that discussions on this phase were already underway, contradicting denials from Netanyahu’s office. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sygugf11qye	2025-02-17T10:50:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/SyQtMUZ1Lye/SyQtMUZ1Lye_0_0_1601_901_0_small.jpg
UK reviews UNRWA funding after ‘concerning’ allegations by Emily ...	Downing St says government will be looking at outcome of probe into claims made by former hostage she was held captive in UNRWA facilities The UK is to review its funding to UNRWA following claims made by freed hostage Emily Damari that she was held by Hamas terrorists at sites belonging to the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA. Downing Street confirmed that funding to the Palestinian relief agency would be among those commitments reviewed against UK taxpayer priorities. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the government would be looking closely at the findings of a UNRWA investigation into 'concerning' claims made by Damari that Palestinian armed groups, including Hamas, were misusing their facilities. In a phone call with Starmer last month, Damari alleged that while being held at an UNRWA facility, her captors only provided her with an out-of-date bottle of iodine to treat gunshot wounds in her leg and her left hand, on which she lost two fingers. On Monday, asked about the government’s forthcoming spending review across all departments, a No.10 spokesperson confirmed UNRWA funding was under review as part of the 'principle that all government spending should be assessed against taxpayer priorities.' Asked about moves by the U.S. and Italian governments, who have stopped their funding to UNRWA, Downing Street said it was 'right' that UNRWA investigates 'the concerning allegations in relation to Emily Damari.' The spokesperson added: 'We will obviously be looking at the outcome of that.' In December, the PM had committed an additional £13 million to UNRWA to support vital services for Palestinian refugees in the West Bank and Gaza, following a meeting with Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini. The previous Conservative government had paused £35 million of funding for UNRWA in office following allegations that members of its staff were linked to Hamas and involved in the October 7 atrocities on Israel. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The agency fired nine staff members in August after an internal investigation found they may have been involved in the Hamas-led attack. Labour restored funding on the basis that the agency had carried out a thorough review of its operations and allegations that employees were linked to Hamas. In a statement last July, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said: 'We are lifting the pause on UK funding to UNRWA. 'The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is devastating and no other agency can get aid into Gaza at the scale needed.' But Chancellor Rachel Reeves has subsequently committed to a second part of her spending review and Plan for Change. Reeves has said: 'All government departments will be expected to find savings and efficiencies in their budgets, in a push to drive out waste in the public sector and ensure all funding is focused on the government’s priorities.' Responding to the review of UNRWA funding, Phil Rosenberg, Board of Deputies president said: 'This is a welcome development. The Board has been raising concerns about funding to UNRWA with the government in recent weeks. Particularly important in light of the testimony of Emily Damari.'

Rubio and Saudi crown prince discuss Gaza after Trump proposal	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman discussed plans for Gaza during a meeting on Monday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said. Rubio is visiting the Middle East after President Donald Trump infuriated the Arab world with a proposal for the Palestinian residents of the war-torn strip to be resettled in other Arab nations and for the U.S. to lead reconstruction of the enclave. 'The Secretary underscored the importance of an arrangement for Gaza that contributes to regional security,' State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a readout of the meeting between Rubio and the crown prince. The two also reaffirmed their commitment to the cease-fire agreed last month between Israel and Hamas and discussed Syria, Lebanon and the Red Sea, Bruce said.

Freed hostage Agam Berger urges national unity in first video mes...	In her first video since returning from Gaza, freed IDF lookout urges Israelis to unite and help bring hostages home, noting Hamas welcomed internal divisions; she recounts refusing to cook for Hamas terrorists on Shabbat while in captivity Agam Berger, an IDF lookout soldier held captive by Hamas for 482 days, appeared in her first video statement Monday, urging Israelis to maintain unity and strength. Berger, who was abducted during the October 7 attack from an IDF operations room in Nahal Oz, said division among Israelis had emboldened their captors. 'When they saw our division, it made them happy,' Berger said. 'They told us that when we are united, we are strong. Let’s preserve our unity and strength as the people of Israel.' She also called on Israelis to take action to help secure the release of the remaining hostages. 'I truly believe that each and every one of us has the power to do something to help bring the hostages home. I ask you to take on just one good deed. It really brings everyone’s return home closer.' Berger thanked Israeli soldiers and security forces for risking their lives in efforts to rescue the hostages. 'Thank you to all the people of Israel who have stood by our families, fought, struggled, supported them, prayed and did everything possible to bring us home.' Berger was freed in January alongside fellow hostages Arbel Yehoud and Gadi Mozes, as well as five Thai nationals. She was released five days after four of her fellow IDF lookouts—Daniella Gilboa, Liri Albag, Karina Ariev and Naama Levy. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On Friday, Berger, Albag, Ariev and Levy met with outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi at the IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv, where Halevi apologized for the military’s failure to protect them on Oct. 7. 'Soldiers dreamed of the privilege of being able to come and rescue you,' Halevi told them. During the meeting, the freed lookouts shared details of their prolonged captivity and expressed feeling abandoned by the IDF during the attack. Halevi praised their performance on Oct. 7, telling them, 'You should never have been underestimated. You are excellent soldiers, and what you did on that day was commendable.' He assured them that the defense establishment was conducting an in-depth investigation into the failures of that day and emphasized their role in the process. 'You have a place in these investigations,' he said. In an interview with Ynet and its sister publication Yedioth Ahronoth, Berger’s mother, Meirav, shared insights into her daughter’s experience in captivity. She said Agam, who grew up secular, fasted on Yom Kippur and Tisha B’Av while in Gaza. 'She told me, 'On Passover, I accidentally ate bulgur; I didn’t know it was chametz,'' Meirav recounted. She also said Agam had found comfort in a prayer book left behind by IDF soldiers. 'She prayed constantly, and it was clear to her she would get through it. She even kept Shabbat there, something she had never done before. When the terrorists told her to cook for them, she said, ‘I don’t light fires on Shabbat.’ As a Haredi woman from generations of religious observance, I don’t know if I would have had such strong faith in a situation like that.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/b1w2pxbc1x	2025-02-17T10:20:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/Skxa7GAxckl/Skxa7GAxckl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Trump's Gaza displacement plan reignites Red Sea shipping concern...	Proposal to relocate Gaza’s population fuels regional tensions, delaying Red Sea shipping recovery; Houthi threat persists, forcing ships to bypass Suez Canal, dealing major economic blow to Egypt’s vital waterway revenues Egypt had been anticipating the cease-fire in Gaza for several reasons, with one of the primary ones being economic: the Suez Canal, one of the country’s most vital sources of income, has suffered significant setbacks since October 7 due to the Houthi threat. With the cease-fire agreement in Gaza and the cessation of Houthi attacks, Cairo hoped that activity in the canal would begin returning to normal. However, statements by U.S. President Donald Trump disrupted these expectations. Trump’s proposals regarding control of the Gaza Strip and relocating its residents to other countries not only provoked outrage across the Arab world—particularly from Egypt and Jordan, two nations that have opposed the relocation of Palestinians to their territories since the war’s outset—but also had indirect consequences, such as disrupting global shipping routes. The Houthis, who naturally oppose Trump’s declarations, renewed their threats to intervene, claiming they would 'support Gaza against displacement' by launching drones and missiles toward Israel. Shipping companies, which had been optimistic about resuming routes through the Suez Canal, once again pulled back, leaving Egypt to deal with ongoing challenges it had hoped were nearing resolution. Chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, Osama Rabie, gave an interview last week on the Egyptian ONtv program The Last Word and stated, 'Trump’s statements and the uncertainty they caused regarding the second phase of the cease-fire agreement have affected maritime traffic in the Red Sea.' He added that there had been expectations for significant improvement in the region following the halt of attacks from Yemen. According to him, there were signs of progress, such as the passage of six U.S. and British ships through the Red Sea in January. Rabie also mentioned that an oil tanker attacked by the Houthis in July passed safely through the route in early February. He expressed optimism that the region was moving toward calm, but noted that shipping companies still preferred to avoid risks and opted for the Cape of Good Hope route instead. When the interviewer, Lamis Al-Hadidi, asked whether Trump’s recent statements had increased regional tensions and potentially created further problems for the Suez Canal, Rabie replied, 'That’s an accurate statement. The signs indicate ships are supposed to return to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal.' Al-Hadidi further noted that there were no guarantees the Gaza cease-fire would hold, and asked, 'Does this statement add to the concern?' Rabie responded, 'Of course, it increases anxiety.' He predicted that maritime activity in the region would gradually recover by the end of March, with operations likely returning to normal by midyear. Since the start of the war, the Houthis have targeted shipping routes through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, the Red Sea, and the Arabian Sea. They consistently claimed to attack vessels linked to Israel, owned by companies working with Israel, or heading to Israeli ports. This created a significant threat in the region, leading to a sharp decline in the number of ships choosing to sail through the Red Sea. Many companies opted for the alternative route around Africa via the Cape of Good Hope. While this route is longer, it is considered safer. However, in March 2024, the threat to Israeli ships expanded to this route as well. Houthi leaders in Yemen, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, and Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree, threatened to target Israeli vessels heading toward the Indian Ocean and the Cape of Good Hope. The British Financial Times recently published an article titled 'Trump’s Gaza proposal shatters hopes for Red Sea shipping recovery.' The article included interviews with senior shipping industry officials who stated that Trump’s plan had heightened regional tensions and increased the likelihood of renewed Houthi involvement. It noted that the Houthis’ January announcement—stating they would only attack Israel-linked ships—had led to a slight uptick in vessels passing through Yemen, but many ships were still waiting for confirmation of regional stability before resuming their routes. Lars Jensen, CEO of a company providing consulting services to shipowners and traders, was quoted in the article as saying, 'Early hopes for a return to Red Sea shipping have been dashed. A week ago, there was light at the end of the tunnel, but now the likelihood of resuming Red Sea traffic is diminishing.' Vincent Clerc, CEO of shipping giant Maersk, also spoke to the Financial Times, stating, 'Returning to the Suez Canal is a complex process, and we need to ensure it’s not just for a few months. As long as there’s uncertainty about what the situation will look like in the coming weeks, we’ll wait.' According to Maersk, Red Sea trade could resume by mid-2025 in the best-case scenario, but in the worst-case scenario, it could remain limited until the end of the year. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The war has severely impacted Suez Canal revenues. According to Rabie’s latest report, losses are estimated at 61–62% of the canal’s projected revenue for the fiscal year ending in June 2025. Over the past 15 months, total losses are estimated at $6.8 billion, and if the current situation continues, the losses will grow further. He noted that the daily number of ships crossing the canal currently stands at 30–32, compared to 72–75 in the past. Rabie also pointed out that since November 19, 2023, 10,517 ships have opted for the alternative Cape of Good Hope route: 'All of these would have passed through the Suez Canal if not for the security threats.' Despite the tense situation, economic crisis, and concerns about the future, Rabie announced last week the inauguration of the 'Suez Canal Duplication Project,' allowing an additional 6–8 ships to pass through the canal daily. The project, which involves expanding the canal and creating a 6-mile dual section, is part of a broader plan to develop its southern sector. The initiative was implemented following the Ever Given container ship incident in March 2021, which halted traffic for a week. Egypt hopes the expansion will boost the canal’s revenues, but for this to happen, ships need to return to the route. The Suez Canal Authority has been actively promoting the canal on social media to attract more shipping companies to resume their routes. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy5cikz5je	2025-02-17T09:59:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/19/rJ54lOyD6/rJ54lOyD6_1_230_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Yarden Bibas defies Hamas, fights for his wife and children’s fat...	Despite claims his wife and children killed, ex-hostage clings to hope, inspiring those around him; other freed hostages, like Eli Sharabi, face devastating realities, while families demand urgent action to bring all remaining hostages home without delay Yarden Bibas and Eli Sharabi, both survivors of captivity, were confronted with devastating news upon their return to Israel. For Sharabi, it was the confirmation that his wife Lianne and their daughters, Noiya, 16, and Yahel, 13, were murdered in the October 7 terrorist attack and that his brother Yossi died in captivity. For Yarden, the uncertainty surrounding the fate of his wife Shiri and their children, Kfir and Ariel, remains unbearable. While Hamas claims they are dead, Israeli authorities have yet to confirm this. 'Grave concern for their fate' is the prevailing sentiment, and despite the slim chances, Yarden’s family says he remains driven by faith and determination. Jimmy Miller, Shiri Bibas’ cousin, shared with Ynet that the family draws strength from Yarden’s unwavering belief. 'Yarden isn’t focusing on himself or what he went through,' Miller explained, 'but on bringing his family back to Israel. He believes Hamas’ claims about Shiri and the children’s deaths are speculative. If he believes, who are we to doubt him?' Miller added, 'We gain strength from him—his resilience, his faith and the hope he carries. We truly hope Yarden will one day smile again, both in body and in spirit. We pray Shiri and the children return soon. They deserve it, Yarden deserves it and so do we all. Every hostage must be brought home.' Miller also spoke about the condition of returning hostages, saying, 'We see them walking on both feet, but no one sees the scars beneath their clothes or the wounds in their souls. Beneath their clothes are countless bruises, scars and injuries. On the surface, they may smile, hug and seem in good spirits, but that’s just adrenaline. After being chained, abused and barely fed for so long, this is a natural reaction. Their bodies are broken, their souls even more so, and it will take a long time before they can resume anything resembling a normal life.' He continued, 'The last three hostages who were released were taken from the area near Khan Younis and kidnapped from Nir Oz, just like Shiri and the children. Have we received any indication or news? The army comes to us directly with updates. As far as I know, there’s been no new information about Shiri and the children. We remain in the dark. There’s heavy uncertainty about their fate, their whereabouts, or even if they’re alive. But we hold on to hope—that’s all we have—and we pray we won’t be disappointed.' When asked what message he wanted to send decision-makers about continuing the release efforts, Miller stated, 'I want to believe that we don’t need a Phase II or Phase III of this process. We need to do everything in one phase—continue Phase I without delay. We don’t want phases II and III to get stuck. We know there are people still in dire conditions, and we can’t let this stall. I hope decision-makers unanimously agree this operation must continue until every hostage is brought back home. President Trump fully supports this. Even he doesn’t understand why we aren’t pushing harder or demanding it outright, and I hope this momentum continues.' Meanwhile, Emily Damari, who was released from captivity in the first round of the current hostage deal, visited the Western Wall on Monday, marking 500 days since the abduction of her friends, Gali and Ziv Berman, the twin hostages still held captive. 'At the holiest place for our people, I prayed for Gali and Ziv, and for all the other hostages who have been in Hamas captivity for 500 days. They must return as soon as possible,' she wrote in an Instagram post. In another post she shared, Damari included a note: 'All of Israel’s hostages held by Hamas will return in the coming days. May God grant Gali ben (son of) Talia and Ziv ben Talia complete healing and strength to endure, and may they hold on to their faith that they will soon be with us again.' Osnat Sharabi-Matalon, sister of Eli and Yossi, whose body remains in Gaza, told Ynet, 'Eli is beginning to process the bitter news of what happened during those 500 days. He’s taking it one step at a time, at his own pace. Every day there’s a little progress, even if it’s small. That’s why we remain optimistic.' She continued, 'I believe the time will come when Eli will be able to share his story. We’ll leave that space for him. For now, we must keep going, especially for the 73 remaining hostages. We are overjoyed for every family that is reunited with their loved ones, giving them the chance to care for them and be with them.' Osnat emphasized that Eli returned with a mission: 'He came back determined to help rescue everyone still there. He passed on critical information to the relevant authorities to assist in saving those left behind. I believe those who received this information are acting on it, and Eli believes that too.' Speaking about Eli’s physical condition, she remarked on his fragile and emaciated appearance, which reminded many of Holocaust survivors. 'That image was so stark,' she said. 'It spoke louder than any words we could use to describe his ordeal. We must understand that time is running out. This isn’t fabricated—it’s real, and we have no time to waste.' In recent days, a crowdfunding campaign for Eli has gained traction, sparking widespread anger among citizens questioning why the government isn’t providing for him. Osnat explained, 'This initiative was started by close friends, childhood friends of Eli. He’s a social person with many circles of friends. I think people didn’t know how else to help. His image shook the entire country, and even the diaspora, and people just wanted to do something for him. This campaign isn’t about what the state provides or doesn’t provide. We’re not there yet. We’re taking things one step at a time, and more will become clear as we go.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Yehuda Cohen, father of Nimrod Cohen, who remains in captivity in Gaza, shared his thoughts after receiving proof of life from his son through one of the returning hostages. 'We received what Ron Dermer didn’t want us to have—what he tried to convince the Americans of: That they’re all dead and there’s no point in fighting for their return. Yes, the hostages are coming back, and they’re bringing information. They show us there’s still a fight worth fighting to bring everyone back.' When asked about his stance, despite the ongoing release process, Cohen said, 'This deal is happening because Trump made it happen. It’s not because Netanyahu wanted it or his government did. Trump told him, ‘Enough is enough. You won’t play games with me—I’m not Biden.’ That’s why this deal moved forward.' Cohen expressed hope, saying, 'With the help of Trump, Steve Witkoff, and the American administration, we’ll move on to the next phase and bring all the hostages home. Yesterday, we saw Witkoff at the Nova memorial event in Miami, and he’s committed. Unlike Netanyahu, who sits in his ivory tower trying to survive another day as prime minister, we’ve had to rely on outside forces to compel the Israeli government to do what it is legally obligated to do: protect and save Israeli lives.' When asked about the returning hostages’ accounts of Nimrod’s condition, Cohen said, 'They were with him until their release. The proof of life we received confirms that he is alive, healthy, and stable after 500 days. He’s there, and he will return alive—we’ll make sure of it. The message is clear: we have proof of life for Nimrod, and we’re making it public as his life insurance, to protect him and prevent Netanyahu and Dermer from spinning false stories that they’re all dead, that there’s no urgency, and that no deal is needed.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyybjae91e	2025-02-17T09:47:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/S1KdwKi00ye/S1KdwKi00ye_141_47_1408_793_0_small.jpg

Cunio, 33, of Kibbutz Nir Oz, is alive, recently released hostage tells his wife; Cunio kidnapped after holding his family’s shelter door shut for 5 hours to protect them; his wife and daughters freed in November 2023 hostage deal A recently released hostage has informed Sharon Aloni-Cunio that her husband, David Cunio, who was kidnapped by Hamas during the October 7 terrorist attack, is alive, a family source said on Monday. Sharon and their two daughters, Emma and Yuli, were also abducted but were released in the first phase of a prisoner exchange in November 2023 after 52 days in captivity. David Cunio, 33, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, held the door of the family’s safe room shut for five hours as Hamas terrorists attempted to break in. While he remains in captivity, his young daughters recently celebrated their fourth birthday, blowing out candles on their cake with a wish for their father’s return. David’s brother, Ariel, 26, was also kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz along with his partner, Arbel Yehoud. The two grew up together in the kibbutz. Their mother, Silvia Cunio, participated in a march marking nine months since her sons were taken hostage, saying at the time: 'They have been there for 273 horrific days, so close yet in hell. My strength is gone. There isn’t a day I don’t cry, not a second I don’t think about what they are going through.' Arbel was released in late January as part of the first phase of the hostage deal after 482 days in Gaza. Meanwhile, Israel is preparing for the possible return of four bodies of hostages on Thursday as part of ongoing negotiations, according to Israeli officials. The bodies are expected to be transferred to Israel two days earlier than planned for DNA testing, a process that must be completed before the Sabbath. As part of the agreement, three living hostages are expected to be released on Saturday.

Claims Conference launches program to expand support for Holocaus...	The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany (Claims Conference) has launched a new initiative to provide direct support for Holocaust survivors in Israel, the organization announced on Monday. The program, developed in collaboration with the Veterans Administration within Israel’s Ministry of Social Welfare and Social Security, is already operational with the backing of local authorities across the country. The initiative includes special funding from the Claims Conference to hire social workers dedicated exclusively to assisting Holocaust survivors. These professionals play a critical role in helping survivors, many of whom are in advanced age, access their rights, secure services, and utilize available support systems. 'The Claims Conference is fully committed to ensuring that every Holocaust survivor in Israel can access the rights and services they deserve—we can’t allow even one survivor to be alone,' said Tziona Koenig-Yair, the Claims Conference’s Associate Executive Vice President in Israel. 'Some survivors have no family and require more individual attention. Social workers can step in like family and provide this much-needed care.' Koenig-Yair noted that the program has already shown success, crediting its impact to the partnership between the Claims Conference, the Ministry of Social Welfare, and an increasing number of Israeli municipalities. The organization funds a wide range of services, including food assistance, mobile health vans, income supplement food cards, community support programs, friendly visitation, psychological services, and senior day centers. 'Creating an appropriate care plan and matching each survivor’s needs with the right programs is essential,' she added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hykuzgb5ye	2025-02-17T08:30:37-08:00

Lebanon extends ban on flights from Iran amid Hezbollah funding a...	Ban extended indefinitely after blocking Tehran-Beirut plane over Israeli warning, sparking Hezbollah-led riots near airport; Iran retaliates by barring Lebanese flights, while Beirut scrambles to bring home stranded citizens from Tehran Lebanon’s Cabinet on Monday approved an extension of the suspension of flights between Lebanon and Iran, which was initially set to expire Tuesday. It remains unclear when flights will resume. The decision follows last week’s ban on an Iranian Mahan Air flight scheduled to land in Beirut, which Lebanon’s newly formed government blocked at the last minute. The move came after IDF Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned that Israel would act against civilian flights allegedly used by Iran to transfer cash to Hezbollah—an implicit threat against Beirut’s international airport. Sources told Ynet that Israeli intelligence had identified millions of dollars in cash aboard the Iranian aircraft, reportedly intended to help Hezbollah recover from recent military losses. The flight ban sparked protests from Hezbollah supporters, who blocked roads leading to Beirut’s airport and attacked a UNIFIL convoy. The unrest drew widespread condemnation within Lebanon and across the Arab world. Seeking to balance public outrage with political pragmatism, Hezbollah announced a 'silent protest' on the airport road Saturday, stating it opposed violence while rejecting what it called an unjust decision. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In response to Lebanon’s move, Iran announced it would block flights from Lebanon from landing on its soil until the flight restrictions to Beirut were lifted. Lebanese presidential spokesperson Najat Charafeddine said Foreign Minister Joe Rajji was overseeing efforts to facilitate the return of Lebanese nationals stranded in Iran and ensuring compliance with aviation inspection requirements. The Mahan Air flight was carrying 300 Lebanese passengers returning from religious pilgrimages in Iran, who are now stuck in Tehran. Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese broadcaster Al Manar aired footage Monday purportedly showing stranded Lebanese travelers protesting in the Iranian city of Qom, demanding their government allow their return. According to the report, the passengers called the flight ban 'an unjust and unpatriotic decision.' Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said Tehran's position was 'clear' and that Lebanese and Iranian foreign ministers had engaged in 'constructive talks' aimed at resolving the dispute. He emphasized the importance of making decisions 'without external interference.' Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, leader of the Shiite Amal movement, was quoted by Lebanese daily Al Joumhouria as calling for direct negotiations between Lebanon and Iran to resolve the issue. 'We cannot allow the enemy to dictate our decisions as they are trying to do. We are not an Israeli colony, and we will not become one,' Berri said, rejecting any external influence over Lebanese sovereignty. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjjdcjbqyx	2025-02-17T08:07:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/16/r1qYsnycJg/r1qYsnycJg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Hamas expected to return remains of 4 hostages; Jerusalem demands terror group doubles number of living hostages slated to be released Saturday Israel is preparing for the potential return of four hostage bodies on Thursday as part of the ongoing hostage deal with Hamas, Israeli officials said Monday. The transfer, initially scheduled for next week, was moved up to allow time for DNA testing and identification procedures before the Sabbath. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Meanwhile, the Security Cabinet is set to convene Monday evening amid growing concerns that the deal could collapse, coinciding with the 500th day since Hamas’ October 7 attack. The meeting is expected to focus on the second phase of negotiations, which were supposed to begin on the 16th day of the cease-fire. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich is expected to raise U.S. President Donald Trump’s controversial proposal for the relocation of Palestinians from Gaza, though it remains unclear whether a vote will take place. Under the current deal, three living hostages are scheduled for release on Saturday. However, Israel is demanding the release of six hostages instead, in exchange for the delivery of hundreds of mobile housing units to Gaza. The Cabinet meeting was announced on Sunday shortly after Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, disclosed in an interview with Fox News that talks on the second phase had already begun—contradicting previous denials from Israeli officials. Witkoff said negotiations would continue this week and that further discussions would determine how to successfully complete the second phase, though its initiation remains uncertain. The second phase of the agreement is expected to involve an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza in exchange for the release of all remaining living hostages. While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office acknowledged Witkoff’s remarks, it clarified that an Israeli delegation set to depart for Cairo on Tuesday has been authorized only to discuss the ongoing implementation of the first phase of the agreement. *This is a breaking news story.

Six of us lived in a 6-square-meter space': Ex-hostage Ohad Ben ...	Freed captive meets president and calls on Israeli public and government to continue fighting for hostages' release; Herzog thanks IDF's efforts and calls for reconstruction and completing deal Former hostage Ohad Ben Ami on Monday described the conditions of his captivity alongside President Isaac Herzog. 'Six of us lived in unbearable conditions in a 6-square-meter (65-square-foot) space. I got out, they’re still there,' he said. 'You can't rest for a minute. We won’t stop until everyone is home with their families.' He urged the Israeli government and the public to continue efforts to secure the hostages’ release. 'Today is the 500th day. Keep going, fight. No one can just sit at home watching TV, hoping someone else will do the job. The moment we were aware people were fighting for us, it gave us strength. That’s our Israeli-Jewish spirit.' Ben Ami — whose wife Raz was also kidnapped and released in the first hostage deal in November 2023 — was held captive for 491 days. He addressed IDF soldiers directly: 'When we were 30 meters [98 feet] underground, we always knew you were above, searching for us, doing everything to find us. You came with a sense of mission.' On Saturday, a video of Ben Ami was screened at the weekly protest at Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square, in which he called for those still in Gaza, 'Stay strong. God willing, you’ll get out.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Today marks the 500th day since the outbreak of this terrible war and Hamas’ barbaric attack on October 7,' Herzog said. 'We have brothers and sisters still there in Gaza, and we want every last one of them home as soon as possible. I am expressing here the deepest sentiments of the people of Israel — to bring them home as quickly as possible and complete the deal.' He thanked IDF soldiers and reservists, saying, 'For 500 days, countless Israeli citizens have been in uniform, serving in reserve duty, risking their lives alongside our courageous regular soldiers and commanders. When they went into battle, they carried pictures of you and the other hostages in their vests. 'They did everything they could. We have lost many brave sons and daughters who fought with heroism, incredible families. Michal and I have met over a thousand bereaved families this year—both soldiers and civilians—amazing people. And all of them went into battle to bring the hostages home. Herzog also addressed displaced Israeli residents: 'We have displaced residents in the north and south who need to return home as soon as possible. We must rebuild the Gaza border communities, restore the northern border, and take pride in our people, who fought this war and achieved remarkable successes. This is a massive regional change. But in the end, everyone in this nation carries deep scars, and all of us want to see the hostages home.' 'I do not take this lightly—not the cost of the deal, nor the risks it entails. I fully understand these pains, and as a security and governmental system, we will have to address all these challenges. But ultimately, we know that our brothers and sisters in Gaza are calling out to us from the depths. We want them home,' he added. He turned to Ben Ami and concluded, 'When I look at you, I think of the saying, 'Whoever saves one life, it is as if he saved an entire world.' Truly, one life was saved—by the people of Israel, by the government’s decision, by the negotiations, by the deal. 'And we want to see them all come home. On this 500th day, we must remember and remind the world every single second of the unimaginable suffering of our brothers and sisters in Gaza. We want them all back—some for rehabilitation, others to be laid to rest in dignity.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1tesil91g	2025-02-17T07:19:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/Sy3agcg91g/Sy3agcg91g_0_49_2560_1441_0_small.jpg

Israel sets up security buffer outposts inside Lebanon ahead of w...	IDF to maintain 5 company outposts near border to protect exposed communities and control infiltration routes; military praises Lebanon’s army deployment for 'exercising governance in Hezbollah-controlled areas like never before' The IDF is establishing a limited security buffer zone inside Lebanese territory along the border, maintaining five forward outposts that will remain manned by hundreds of soldiers after the army completes its withdrawal from southern Lebanon. The Israeli withdrawal follows a two-and-a-half-month interim period which saw the military remain in southern Lebanon after months of fighting as part of Operation Northern Arrows, launched last year amid ongoing clashes with Hezbollah. However, Israel’s military presence across the border marks a partial return to a security posture not seen since its full withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000. The new defensive positions—each staffed by company-sized units—will be located a few hundred yards inside Lebanese territory. While they will remain outside Hezbollah-dominated villages, they are strategically placed to oversee key terrain that posed security challenges before the war. The five outposts stretch from west to east along the border: Sullam Ridge, overlooking infiltration routes from Wadi Qataiya near the Israeli town of Shlomi; Jabal Balat, a former IDF stronghold near the towns of Shtula and Zar’it, controlling access to Zibqin in southern Lebanon; Shaked Ridge, providing oversight of the Saluki River valley, as well as the towns of Aitaroun, Bint Jbeil and Maroun al-Ras; Tzivoni Ridge, situated above Kibbutz Margaliot in the Upper Galilee; and Hamamis Ridge, near the historic French fortress, positioned to monitor Khiam, Kfarkela and the Ayoun Valley near Metula. The decision mirrors Israel’s approach along its southern border, where similar buffer measures have been implemented adjacent to Gaza. Military officials emphasized that while the arrangement does not constitute a full-fledged security zone, it enhances control over border areas. According to the IDF, the redeployment follows months of ground operations that penetrated 5 to 8 kilometers (3 to 5 miles) into Lebanese territory, dismantling Hezbollah military infrastructure. 'We have cleared most border areas of Hezbollah positions and pushed them back from locations where we did not even conduct ground operations,' a military official said. Despite the withdrawal, Israeli forces stationed along the border will now be three times larger than they were before the October 7 attack, when Hezbollah began its attacks in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. Officials also said Israel will maintain its ability to strike beyond the border if deemed necessary. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In anticipation of the cease-fire, Israel has begun efforts to allow tens of thousands of displaced residents of northern communities to return to their homes. However, IDF officials warned that Hezbollah supporters may soon be seen raising the terrorist group’s flags in villages along the border. 'Flags are not a threat,' one official said. 'We have created a strip of land where no Lebanese presence will be permitted.' Meanwhile, the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has begun deploying to areas from which Israeli forces are withdrawing. IDF officials expressed cautious optimism about the LAF’s recent actions, citing its increased enforcement against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and its involvement in recent unrest in Beirut. 'They are doing things they have never done before, exercising governance in Hezbollah-controlled areas,' a military source said. 'We would like to see them act more decisively, but we remain committed to enforcing violations beyond the Litani River, and that is clear to the international enforcement mechanism.' Israeli forces have also reinforced routes to the newly established outposts and said that their placement was coordinated with American and French mediation teams, despite Lebanon's objections. Additionally, Israel remains focused on preventing Hezbollah from receiving cash smuggled from Iran, which officials say is aimed at financing the group's reconstruction efforts. 'We have updated offensive plans for Hezbollah at multiple levels, depending on future developments,' an IDF official added. 'Hezbollah has been significantly weakened, but it still exists in Lebanon.' Even after the cease-fire takes effect, Israeli military operations will continue in certain areas, including near the Lebanon-Syria border. Military officials confirmed that targeted strikes would continue against illicit Hezbollah financial operations, particularly efforts to smuggle Iranian cash into Lebanon. Israeli officials have not ruled out additional escalations, with security analysts warning that Hezbollah's long-term military intentions remain uncertain despite the truce. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj3gmcgcjg	2025-02-17T06:41:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/03/HyQV6G0dkl/HyQV6G0dkl_1_129_1601_901_0_small.jpg

Gush Etzion resident, 17, arrested for spraying graffiti with hostile messages toward Israelis; investigators suspect he was recruited by a foreign entity via Telegram Israel Police have arrested a 17-year-old from Gush Etzion on suspicion of spraying graffiti linked to Islamist terror organizations and carrying hostile messages toward Israelis. Authorities believe the teen was acting on behalf of a foreign entity that had contacted him through the messaging app Telegram. According to police, the graffiti—discovered at multiple locations—was intended to intimidate Israelis. The slogans included 'Children of Ruhollah' and 'Conquerors of Khaybar.' The term 'Ruhollah' is commonly associated with religious and nationalist figures in Shiite Islam, while 'Conquerors of Khaybar' has been used in anti-Jewish contexts, primarily by Islamist groups. Investigators allege that the suspect received cryptocurrency payments from an unidentified foreign source in exchange for his actions. Police say he sprayed between 10 and 15 graffiti messages as part of the arrangement. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Authorities also uncovered evidence that the same foreign source had urged the teen to commit more serious offenses, including setting fire to vehicles and targeting electrical and communications infrastructure. The investigation remains ongoing, with police working to identify additional individuals involved. While no direct evidence links Iran to the case, investigators are exploring the possibility given the nature of past incidents. However, officials stress that, at this stage, there is no confirmation of involvement by any specific country or organization. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byu99tx9ye	2025-02-17T06:05:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/r1AC65xqJg/r1AC65xqJg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Arab media outlet report vehicle targeted in southern part of the country resulting in the death of terror group's commander; strike comes one day before IDF forces withdraw from Lebanon At least one person was killed in a drone strike attributed to Israel on a vehicle in southern Lebanon’s Sidon, Lebanese media reported on Monday. Footage from the scene showed a burning car and a panicked crowd. Hezbollah-affiliated outlet Al-Akhbar reported one fatality, while Saudi outlet Al-Hadath claimed the target was senior Hamas commander Muhammad Shahin. 'The Israeli strike targeted a vehicle at Sidon's northern entrance. Initial reports indicate one casualty. The Lebanese army has sealed off the area,' Hezbollah-linked agency Al-Mayadeen reported. Israeli officials later said the target was a senior Hamas commander but didn't provide additional details. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu interrupted his testimony in the corruption court case against him after receiving an envelope and telling judges, 'I have to leave.' The session was paused, but it's unclear if the incident was related to the strike. Netanyahu had earlier requested a brief recess to speak with Defense Minister Israel Katz. The Israeli Air Force struck Hezbollah military sites in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley on Sunday in response to cease-fire violations. The attack coincided with a televised speech by Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem.

'Terrorist activity at these sites constitutes a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon,' the military said. According to Lebanon's Al Jadeed, two strikes hit the southern villages. In his speech, Qassem criticized a U.S. plan to evacuate Gaza, calling U.S. President Donald Trump’s stance on Palestine 'extremely dangerous.' He accused Trump of trying to 'erase Palestine and its people,' calling it 'political genocide.' 'Israel’s actions are driven and supported by the U.S. We reject any forced displacement to Egypt, Jordan or elsewhere.

Steve Witkoff tells crowd the US intends to succeed in Phase II of cease-fire deal as it did in Phase I and bring all of the hostages home; says US president holds hostage plight close to his heart; 'We will not leave anybody behind' U.S. President Donald Trump's special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said on Sunday that the United States insists on the release of all of the hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza. Witkoff visited the closing of an exhibit in Miami in memory of the victims of the Nova music festival who were murdered in the Hamas massacre or abducted by the terrorists. He came at the invitation of rescued hostage Noa Argamani 'I told the president that I will be here tonight and he was thrilled because this situation holds a special place in his heart. We have to get everybody home,' Witkoff said. He shared his own life experiences when he lost his son to an addiction 13 years ago. 'There are people here who have children in Phase II and they are hopeful that we can be successful in Phase II as we were in Phase I. And I can tell you that we intend to be. We will not leave anybody behind.' Argamani's partner Avinatan Or, who was also also taken hostage during the massacre, is still held in Gaza. 'Standing here today after being rescued by the IDF soldiers is no less than a miracle. But there are 73 hostages who are still there, including my partner who is waiting to be rescued.'

Israel issued a tender for the construction of nearly 1,000 additional settler homes in the West Bank, an anti-settlement watchdog said Monday. Peace Now says the development of 974 new housing units would allow the population of Efrat to expand by 40% and further block the development of the nearby Palestinian city of Bethlehem. Hagit Ofran, who leads the group's settlement monitoring, said construction can begin after the contracting process and issuing of permits, which could take another year at least.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1ruekl51g	2025-02-17T00:44:10-08:00	
If the strong Jewish nation cannot get the hostages home what wa...	Hostages who returned bring signs of life from Alon Ohel and Matan Angrest, and describe horrific conditions of captivity and neglected injuries, while other families still have no clue about their loved ones' conditions; 'I expect each and every one to stop for minute and imagine what it means to be underground for 500 days' Reaching 500 days with hostages still being held captive in Gaza is an abomination,' says Idit Ohel, whose son Alon has been a hostage since he was abducted from what has been called the 'shelter of death' at the Nova music festival during the Hamas massacre on October 7, 2023. 'We have to determine whether we as a society can continue to normalize this and support it.' The family first received sign of life from Alon from hostages who were released, but also were told of the terrible condition he was in and that he had been injured in his eye and had not received treatment. 'It is sad,' Alon's mother says. 'The strong Jewish nation is unable to save innocent people going through a Holocaust. What was this state established for?' Ofir, hostage Matan Angrest's younger brother, says Israelis have become accustomed to the situation. 'On day 500 of this anguish, I expect each and every one to stop for minute and imagine what it means to be underground for 500 days.' He says it has been hard on the family to know they still have a long road ahead before they might be reunited. 'We hear terrible comments in the Knesset from people who do not think that Phase II of the cease-fire should be implemented. They even want to stop this first phase and that is very frightening,' he said. While some families have been reunited with their loved ones, others are still waiting. 'I cannot watch the release of hostages,' Herut Nimrodi, the mother of Tamir, who is held hostage in Gaza, says. 'It is difficult because there's a chance that we may not have such a resolution. I fall apart in anger and tears, but I have to watch because they are coming back alive and they survived the horrors.' Yael, whose son is American-Israeli Edan Alexander, draws strength from the images of hostages being freed. 'I cry and am moved with the families. This could happen to us. If the negotiations continue, it could happen to all of the families. We've asked here and in Washington, in every meeting to please not stop the cease-fire. They are running out of time.' The families of those who would be freed only if Phase II of the deal is implemented, say the cease-fire must not be stopped. 'I think they don't understand the urgency,' Herut Nimrodi says. 'All we can do is hope and have faith in our government and in Prime Minister Netanyahu that he puts the hostages ahead of other considerations.' The testimonies of those who have returned leave no doubt that the captives who were left behind are experiencing hell. 'Hostages who returned told us they saw Matan and that he was seriously injured in his hand and in a bad way,' Ofir says. 'Despite the relief that he is alive, I cannot feel joy. Matan is still there and, until he returns, I have failed. People go to work, fly abroad while he is in the tunnels of Gaza.' Idit says she was told that Alon has been in the tunnels for nearly 500 days and does not receive enough food. 'He has shrapnel in his eye and may loose his sight completely. He only sees shadows now and needs medical care. We know he is bound in chains on his legs and sometimes on his hands as well. These are very difficult and inhumane conditions.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: But Tamir Nimrodi's family knows even less. 'We've had no sign of life,' Herut says.

I am afraid of the certainty but cannot wake up everyday as if it were Oct. 7 again.' There has been no sign of life from Edan Alexander either.

Footage shows Mordechai Brafman, 27, stopping his car in Miami Beach and firing toward two men attempting to flee; suspect tells police he 'killed two Palestinians' Florida police arrested a 27-year-old Jewish man, Mordechai Brafman, on suspicion of attempting to murder two men he believed were Palestinian. The victims were an Israeli father and son visiting from Israel. According to investigators, Brafman overtook their car in Miami Beach, made a U-turn, exited his vehicle and fired 17 shots at them. Local authorities said Brafman didn’t know the victims and there was no prior confrontation between the sides. The shooting took place Saturday at 9:30 p.m. local time (early Sunday in Israel).

The victims and the defendant do not know each other,' Police added that he told investigators he had killed them. Brafman, a married plumber, was interviewed last year by Florida media after vandals targeted a Miami Beach bagel shop displaying an Israeli flag. 'It's just horrifying,' he said at the time. 'I’d like to see more unity, for people to fight less with each other and be more together.'

Iran has defended its nuclear program and will not hesitate to continue doing so, Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said on Monday, a day after Israel and the U.S. vowed to counter Iran's nuclear ambitions.

Hostages and Missing Families Forum says 500 minute-long fast to symbolize the days in captivity is in order to echo the cry of those who cannot be heard; Following march to Knesset, the families are participating in Knesset discussions and sharing information about the condition of their relatives Family members of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, will begin marking day 500 of their captivity on Monday with a fast that will last 500 minutes from 11:40 a.m. to 8 p.m. The 500th day of protests was opened by the headquarters of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum with a special statement from the relatives from the protest camp on Gaza Street in Jerusalem, before a march that began outside the home of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem to the Knesset. The statement of the families of the hostages began with Levi Ben Baruch, the uncle of the kidnapped Idan Alexander, reciting the 'Shema Yisrael' prayer while wrapped in a tallit and tefillin on his hands. 'Today, at 11:40 a.m., we will fast for 500 minutes to show solidarity with the kidnapped men and women, who have been imprisoned for 500 days. We invite the entire people of Israel to join and strengthen the struggle for their return,' said Ben Baruch. At the Knesset, the families are participating in Knesset discussions and sharing information about the condition of their relatives. In the Health Committee, which began at 9:00 a.m., the Ministry of Health has revealed new details about the condition of the returned hostages and their treatment. Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, head of the Medical Division at the Ministry of Health, said: 'We have seen the difficult pictures of people who have lost weight throughout this period. I must point out that it is not only those who are visible to the eye, there are also those who appeared to all of us to be fine - and I cannot say that they are fine until their tests are conducted at the hospital, and only then can I say what their condition is.' On Saturday, three hostages were released from captivity as part of the first phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal and 14 others are to be released. Hamas is still holding 73 captives both dead and alive. 'We announce a day of fasting that is nothing compared to the suffering of those still there. It is a day of solidarity that would strengthen the hostages and echo the cry of those who are not heard,' the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said at the start of the 500th day on Monday.

Trump's direct talks with Russia on end to war could sideline Ukr...	US president sending envoys to Saudi Arabia for direct talks with Russian officials and it is not clear if Europe and Ukraine will have a seat at the table in discussions to end the three-year-long war; There are concerns in Kyiv and other European capitals that the Trump administration wants a quick resolution to the conflict with minimum input from Europe President Donald Trump’s approach to ending Russia’s war against Ukraine has left European allies and Ukrainian officials worried they are being largely sidelined by the new U.S. administration as Washington and Moscow plan direct negotiations. With the three-year war grinding on, Trump is sending Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and special envoy Steve Witkoff to Saudi Arabia for talks with Russian counterparts, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to publicly discuss the upcoming diplomatic efforts and spoke on condition of anonymity. It is unclear to what extent Ukrainian or European officials will be represented in discussions expected to take place in Riyadh in the coming days. The official said the United States sees negotiations as early-stage and fluid, and who ultimately ends up at the table could change. In an exchange with reporters Sunday, Trump said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky 'will be involved' in the negotiations. Trump offered no further explanation. The outreach comes after comments by top Trump advisers this past week, including Vice President JD Vance, raised new concerns in Kyiv and other European capitals that the Republican administration is intent on quick resolution to the conflict with minimum input from Europe. 'Decades of the old relationship between Europe and America are ending,' Zelensky said in an address Saturday at the Munich Security Conference. 'From now on, things will be different, and Europe needs to adjust to that. White House officials on Sunday pushed back against the notion that Europe has been left out of the conversation. Trump spoke by phone in recent days with French President Emmanuel Macron and is expected to consult with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer this week. During his visit to Munich and Paris, Vance held talks with Macron, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte as well as Zelensky. 'Now they may not like some of this sequencing that is going on in these negotiations but I have to push back on this ... notion that they aren’t being consulted,' Waltz told 'Fox News Sunday.' 'They absolutely are and at the end of the day, though, this is going to be under President Trump’s leadership that we get this war to an end,’’ Waltz said. Rubio, who was in Israel on Sunday before heading to Saudi Arabia, said the U.S. is taking a careful approach as it reengages with Moscow after the Biden administration’s clampdown on contacts with the Kremlin following the February 2022 invasion. Trump spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week and the two leaders agreed to begin high-level talks on ending the war. They were initially presented as two-way, but Trump later affirmed that Ukraine would have a seat — though he did not say at what stage. It was not immediately clear whether any Ukrainians would take part in the upcoming Riyadh talks. A Ukrainian delegation was in Saudi Arabia on Sunday to pave the way for a possible visit by Zelensky, according to Ukraine’s economy minister. Starmer, the U.K. premier, wrote in an op-ed for Monday’s Daily Telegraph that Ukraine must be involved in any negotiations on its future 'because anything less would accept Putin’s position that Ukraine is not a real nation. > Starmer also recalled the U.S. disastrous troop withdrawal from Afghanistan under President Joe Biden. 'We cannot have another situation like Afghanistan, where the U.S. negotiated directly with the Taliban and cut out the Afghan government,' Starmer said. 'I feel sure that President Trump will want to avoid this too.' Trump on Sunday said he believed Putin is eager for a deal, while also noting that Russia has historically impressed on the battlefield. 'I think he wants to stop fighting,' Trump said. 'They have a big powerful machine, you understand that. they defeated Hitler and they defeated Napoleon. They’ve been fighting a long time.' Heather Conley, a deputy assistant secretary of state for Central Europe during Republican President George W. Bush’s administration, said that with Trump’s current approach to Moscow, the U.S. appears to be 'seeking to create a new international approach based on a modern-day concert of great powers.' 'As in the 11th and early 20th centuries, it is only for the great powers to decide the fate of nations and to take — either by purchase or force — that which strengthens the great powers’ economic and security interests,' Conley said. 'Each of these powers posit claims or coerce countries in their respective regional spheres of influence.' There is some debate inside the administration about its developing approach to Moscow, with some more in favor of a rapid rapprochement and others wary that Putin is looking to fray the Euro-Atlantic alliance as he aims to reclaim Russian status and wield greater influence on the continent, according to the U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Trump said last week that he would like to see Russia rejoin what is now the Group of Seven major economies. Russia was suspended from the G8 after Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region. 'I’d like to have them back. I think it was a mistake to throw them out. Look, it’s not a question of liking Russia or not liking Russia,' Trump told reporters. 'I think Putin would love to be back.' The anticipated Saudi talks also come amid tension over Trump’s push to get the Ukrainians to agree to give the U.S access to Ukraine’s deposits of rare earth minerals in exchange for some $66 billion in military aid that Washington has provided Kyiv since the start of the war, as well as future defense assistance. Zelensky, who met on Friday with Vance and other senior U.S. officials in Munich, said he had directed Ukraine’s minister to not sign off, at least for now. He said in an interview that the deal as presented by the U.S. was too focused on American interests and did not include security guarantees for Ukraine. The White House called Zelensky’s decision 'short-sighted,' and argued that a rare-earth’s deal would tie Ukraine closer to the United States — something that Moscow doesn’t want to see. European officials were also left unsettled by some of Vance’s remarks during his five-day visit to Paris and Munich last week in which he lectured them on free speech and illegal migration on the continent. He warned that they risk losing public support if they don’t quickly change course. Vance also met while in Munich with Alice Weidel, the co-leader and candidate for chancellor of the far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party in this month’s election. Throughout Europe, officials are now looking to recalibrate their approach in the face of the Trump administration’s unfolding Ukraine strategy. Macron will convene top European countries in Paris on Monday for an emergency 'working meeting' to discuss next steps for Ukraine, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said Sunday. 'A wind of unity is blowing over Europe, as we perhaps have not felt since the COVID period,' Barrot told public broadcaster France-Info. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1smdlxcjl	2025-02-16T21:54:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/07/H1BPotqZyg/H1BPotqZyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Home Office set to block extremist preacher from entering UK for ...	Lebanon born Mohamed Hoblos who expresses support for Hamas is invited to speak at a mosque in Middlesbrough; Germany and the Netherlands ban his entry over his inflamitory comments Lebanese born preacher Mohamed Hoblos was due to appear on February 23 in Middlesbrough to give a talk at a new mosque. Labour MP Luke Myer urged Security Minister Dan Jarvis to look into the preacher’s previous record of inflammatory statements in the Commons on Wednesday. Sources told Jewish News on Thursday that the Home Office were 'ready to block' Hoblos from entering the UK on the grounds that his presence was 'not conducive to the public good.' Hoblos has already been banned from Germany and the Netherlands after his record of making hugely inflammatory comments was raised, including claims that last November in a speech at a rally in Sydney, Australia he ridiculed those who call on Muslims to condemn Hamas terror and the massacre of Israelis, stating, 'Don’t forget that Israel is the oppressor.' In a further rant in praise of the people of Gaza, he suggested Palestinian deaths were honorable while Israel victims were sent to 'hellfire'. The preacher, who lives in Australia has also faced claims he has suggested non-practicing Muslims should be punished. A YouTube video from 2017 shows him stressing the importance of prayer – known as Salah – in a two-minute speech. He asks his followers if someone who sells drugs, murders someone and rapes a child is 'good or bad'. 'This person, one person who commits all these sins on a daily basis – but he prays – is better in the eyes of Allah than the one who doesn’t commit any of these sins, but doesn’t pray,' he says.

Mideast analyst: Washington and Jerusalem in 'total alignment' on...	Dr. Dan Diker, president of the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs said it is understood by both America and Israel that Israel will resume fighting against Hamas in Gaza and that there may not be a second stage of the hostage-for-ceasefire deal The release of weapons to Israel by Washington, alongside the visit of newly appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to the country, shows there is 'total alignment' between Washington and Jerusalem, according to Dr. Dan Diker, president of the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs. Diker said it is understood by both America and Israel that Israel will resume fighting against Hamas in Gaza and that there may not be a second stage of the hostage-for-ceasefire deal. Rather, the first phase may be extended to get as many hostages out as possible before the fighting resumes. 'Marco Rubio has been saying now for two years that the Hamas terror organization must be destroyed,' Diker noted. 'He said it scores of times on the record.' Diker highlighted that, in addition, Rubio has said 'so clearly, so articulately, immediately after taking office' that the Iranian regime is the source of all subversion, instability, and terror in the Middle East and around the world. 'You couldn't have a clearer statement by a secretary of state,' he said. 'So what he has done is to integrate the Hamas tentacle of the Iranian octopus with the head of the octopus itself, which is in Tehran, so you have an alignment strategically.'

More freed Israeli hostages detail torture, starvation and isolat...	Israel's Ministry of Health said the released hostages are now in the early stages of a long rehabilitation process After 498 days in captivity, Israeli hostages Sagui Dekel-Chen, Iair Horn, and Alexander 'Sasha' Troufanov are back in Israel, receiving care at Sheba and Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Centers. Their release has revealed the brutal conditions they endured. Held in Hamas tunnels, they faced relentless interrogations, physical torture, and near-starvation. They drank salty, undrinkable water and lived among lice, bedbugs, and mold. Many, including Dekel-Chen, suffered untreated injuries that may now require surgery. Horn, who was held for a time with his brother Eitan—who remains in captivity—provided Israeli authorities with crucial signs of life for other hostages. Meanwhile, Troufanov spent much of his captivity in solitary confinement. Held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, like hostages Gadi Moses and Arbel Yehud, who also endured captivity completely alone. Troufanov was cut off from the outside world and only learned of his father’s murder upon his return. Dekel-Chen was held in a Gaza hospital for his first few weeks in captivity and tortured during interrogations. He carries scars from it, including a shoulder wound he suffered on October 7. He had no connection to the outside world and didn’t know if his family had survived. He learned just three days ago that he would be released. The Ministry of Health said the men are now in the early stages of a long rehabilitation process. Despite their physical and emotional scars, they are reunited with their families, surrounded by Israel’s top medical teams. The strength of these survivors echoes the stories of previously released hostages, like Karina Ariev, who endured horrific abuse and returned home with severe physical and psychological wounds. 'They broke her nose, beat her, burned her with the butts (of their weapons), threw her on a scorching jeep that stood in the sun all day, and she has burns from it,' said Ariev's father, Albert Ariev. 'And she was injured, and they pushed and pulled her and tore her hair. Indescribable abuse.' With at least 73 hostages still in Gaza—half declared dead in absentia—their testimonies are a painful reminder of why Israel must continue fighting to bring everyone home.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy11zj7l5kx	2025-02-16T18:26:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/16/HkNd5hsJq1g/HkNd5hsJq1g_0_47_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Hispanic Christian delegation in Israel amid growing Evangelical ...	The 30 pastors on the trip collectively reach millions of Latino Evangelical Christians in America A delegation of prominent Hispanic-Evangelical Christian leaders has just completed a 10-day mission to Israel with Eagles’ Wings, aimed at strengthening Christian support for the Jewish state. Led by Bishop Robert Stearns, founder of Eagles’ Wings, and Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, the visit was one of the largest faith-based Hispanic delegations to Israel in recent years. These leaders are growing in influence across the U.S., including within President Donald Trump’s circle. The 30 pastors on the trip collectively reach millions of Latino Evangelical Christians in America. 'This past election that we just saw in America, I think, indicated the growing power of the Latino vote in America,' Stearns told ILTV. 'Forty-six percent of Latinos voted for Donald Trump, 54% of Latino males, and arguably the most influential figure in Latino evangelical circles is Pastor Sam Rodriguez.' Rodriguez added that 78% of Latino Evangelicals, the largest demographic in America, 'that community voted for President Trump, and again his stance on Israel, on pushing back against this constant angst in the region and what we tolerate. 'The last four years unfortunately demonstrated that when America is weak, adversity will arise,' Rodriguez said. 'Weakness attracts adversity, and Latinos said, ‘There's a new sheriff in town.’' The Christian leaders said they came to Israel not just to pray, but to stand in solidarity through action, education, and advocacy. They visited holy sites like the Western Wall, historic landmarks such as Yad Vashem, and met with top political leaders. Rodriguez, recently appointed to Pastor Paula White’s team in the White House Faith Office, and Stearns said they hope to use their platforms to advocate for Israel and the Jewish people. 'The issue of the faith office dealing with domestic issues also arises with the antisemitism that is arising in America, which is an absolute outrage that we're seeing all across American culture, and the need for us as Christians to address antisemitism and to stand with our Jewish brothers and sisters,' Rodriguez added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry7x00mlcje	2025-02-16T18:17:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/SkgvFme51l/SkgvFme51l_0_266_1440_811_0_small.jpg
Trump sends bombs and bulldozers to Israel	The MK-84 is an unguided 2,000-pound bomb, which the Biden administration had blocked from being sent to Israel over concerns that it would be used in Gaza Israel has received a shipment of heavy MK-84 bombs from the United States after U.S. President Donald Trump lifted an embargo imposed on these weapons by the previous Biden administration. According to a statement from Israel's Defense Ministry on Sunday morning, the shipment of over 1,500 MK-84 bombs arrived on Saturday night through the Ashdod seaport and was transferred to Air Force bases across the country. The MK-84 is an unguided 2,000-pound bomb, which the Biden administration had blocked from being sent to Israel over concerns that it would be used in Gaza. In one of his first acts as president, Trump lifted the weapons embargo. Another shipment containing 132 D9 bulldozers is also en route to Israel. The bulldozers were purchased by Israel, but the Biden administration had frozen their transfer. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz thanked President Trump and the U.S. administration for their unwavering support of Israel, stating that the shipment represents a significant asset for the Air Force and the IDF. He added that it serves as further evidence of the strong alliance between Israel and the United States. Katz also noted that during a recent conversation, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth reaffirmed America’s commitment to providing Israel with all necessary tools to ensure its security.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjwxumgcyx	2025-02-16T18:03:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/BJdyD7eq1g/BJdyD7eq1g_606_120_324_183_0_small.jpg
Trump: Hostages have to come back now but Netanyahu can do what h...	US president says he had given Israel the freedom to decide how to respond and claimed that his threat alone caused terror group to walk back its announcement that the deal was off US President Donald Trump said Hamas failed to meet his demand to release 'everyone,' delivering only three hostages on Saturday, but Israel accepted this outcome in accordance with the agreed-upon terms of the phased deal. Trump addressed the situation on Sunday evening, acknowledging that the deadline he set had passed without being met. He explained that he had given Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the freedom to respond as they saw fit and claimed that his threat prompted Hamas to back down from its announcement that the deal was off. Speaking to reporters before boarding Air Force One, Trump said he told Netanyahu, 'You do whatever you want.' He said he made the demand for the release of all the hostages because Hamas initially refused to release the three individuals scheduled for Saturday under the deal. Trump said Hamas ultimately complied after he made that statement: 'They eventually agreed, and when I made that clear, they released everyone plus an American citizen,' referring to Sagui Dekel-Chen. Trump noted that the hostages released this weekend appeared to be in better condition compared to those freed earlier, whom he said 'looked like Holocaust survivors.' As for the next phase of the deal, Trump said, 'That’ll be up to Israel in consultation with me.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Trump's remarks came as Netanyahu announced he would convene the security cabinet on Monday to discuss negotiations for the second phase of the deal, which had been set to begin two weeks ago. Netanyahu also said an Israeli delegation would travel to Cairo with a limited mandate to discuss only the implementation of the current phase, adding that instructions for the next stage would come later, after the cabinet meeting. Netanyahu made the announcement after speaking with Trump's envoy to the region, Steve Witkoff, who had already revealed to Fox News that talks on the second phase had begun. The timeline for the second phase, which is supposed to end the war and secure the release of all remaining living hostages, remains unclear. Netanyahu is reportedly pushing to extend the current phase with additional hostage releases, but Hamas has little incentive to agree while Netanyahu refuses to commit to halting the fighting. The prime minister reiterated Sunday that Israel would 'finish the job' and destroy Hamas. So far, 19 hostages have been released under the first phase, along with five Thai nationals who were not part of the original deal. Of the 33 hostages covered by the current stage, 14 remain, six of them alive. Another 73 hostages are still being held in Gaza. Monday will mark 500 days since the hostages were taken. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syco11jeckg	2025-02-16T13:45:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/SkRN2ZWFye/SkRN2ZWFye_0_96_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Saudi Arabia wants to mediate new US-Iran nuclear deal, report	Saudis are concerned that after loosing its regional proxies including Hezbollah and the Assad regime, Tehran may advance its nuclear capability; Trump says a deal is always the better option Saudi wants to mediate between the United States an Iran in their efforts to reach a new nuclear deal, CNN reported on Sunday, claiming the Saudis are concerned that the severe blows to Iran's proxies in the Middle East in the past year, could encourage the regime in Tehran to achieve nuclear capability. The U.S. State Department did not comment on this report. 'Saudi officials see the current regional landscape as a historic opportunity to de-escalate tensions with Iran and improve ties, insisting that they want no part in any American or Israeli confrontation with the country,' CNN said. U.S. President Donald Trump has said he hoped that a deal could be made with Iran that would prevent further escalation. 'It would really be nice if that could be worked out without having to go that further step,' he said amid reports that Israel was planning to attack Iranian nuclear sites. 'I want Iran to be a great and successful Country, but one that cannot have a Nuclear Weapon. Reports that the United States, working in conjunction with Israel, is going to blow Iran into smithereens,’ ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED,' Trump posted on Truth Social last week. The Washington Post reported on Friday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed potential American backing for an Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities with the president. The discussions reportedly covered a range of U.S. support options, from direct military assistance—including intelligence sharing and aerial refueling—to political backing for an Israeli ultimatum demanding Iran abandon its nuclear program. The Post reported earlier that US intelligence assessments indicated Israel planned to strike Iran early in 2025, taking advantage of the compromised air defenses following the IDF strike last October and the changed balance of power in the Middle East after the blows to the Hezbollah terror group in Lebanon and the fall of the Assad regime.

Families of hostages to mark 500 days of loved ones in captivity	Hostages and Missing Families Forum says 500 minute long fast to symbolize the days in captivity is in order to eccho the cry of those who cannot be heard Family members of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, will begin marking day 500 of their captivity on Monday with a fast that would last 500 minutes from 11:40 AM to 8 PM. A march would begin outside the home of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem and end at the Knesset. On Saturday, three hostages were released from captivity as part of the first phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal and 14 others are to be released. Hamas is still holding 73 captives both dead and alive. 'We announce a day of fasting that is nothing compared to the suffering of those still there.

43 million seconds of hell never seeing daylight': family of fre...	Israeli-American Sagui Dekel-Chen was unaware that his wife and daughters survived the Hamas massacre until a day before his release; Wife Avital, describes their emotional reunion and urges continued efforts to bring home the remaining hostages Sagui Dekel-Chen an American Israeli, never saw daylight the entire time he was held hostage and did not know if his wife and daughters survived the Hamas massacre of October 7, when he was abducted from their home, to Gaza. 'After 498 days in Hamas captivity, Sagui is here — just upstairs, standing on his feet with a big smile and joy in his heart,' his wife Avital said. 'The first time he found out we were alive was a day before he was freed.' Avital, who gave birth to their third daughter while her husband was held captive, spoke to reporters at the Sheba Medical Center where her husband was taken for medical evaluation and treatment. '498 Days — or 43 Million Seconds of Hell' She said her husband told her not to refer to his time in the hands of Hamas as nearly 500 days but to understand that he was held captive for 43 million seconds of hell. Looking back, she described the terror of the attack and its aftermath. 'On October 7, I stood in the safe room with my two daughters while heavily pregnant. For hours, I waited for Sagui to come back, open the door and take us out. A day later, I found myself boarding a bus alone — without Sagui — with two little girls, heading into the hardest journey of my life.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'How did he survive? Through love,' she said. 'We discovered that, without knowing, we were each doing things exactly as the other had hoped. When I saw Sagui yesterday, I finally felt like I could step out of that safe room and start healing. We are finally together as a whole family — three daughters, a mother and a father.' After more than a year apart, Sagui finally met his daughters again. 'As Gali and Bar ran toward their father, and as Shachar saw him in real life for the first time — not just in pictures — I couldn’t help but think of the children still waiting for their fathers to come home.' She turned to the plight of the other families: 'There are children in Israel who wake up every morning and ask, ‘When is Daddy coming back?’ We must do everything to ensure that no child ever has to ask that again.' Avital then addressed the families of those still in Gaza. 'To all who are listening — don’t lose hope. We will bring everyone home. There is no other option. Sagui told me yesterday, ‘Milly, people say 498 days, but really, it felt more like 43 million seconds of hell.’ They don’t count days or hours — they count seconds.' 'A Shattered Community Still Waiting' Sagui’s father, Jonathan, spoke next, describing the impact of the kidnapping not just on his family, but on their entire kibbutz. 'I stand here as a father whose son has come home — a son who is a father to three daughters and a husband to a courageous woman who spoke before me,' he said. 'He is part of the Nir Oz community, which is shattered and still waiting for 20 more hostages to come home.' He thanked those who supported the hostage deal that led to his son’s release and urged continued efforts to bring the rest of the captives back. 'It took courage to reach this deal. We can all agree it isn’t perfect, but it brought Sagui and two more friends from Nir Oz home — and it must continue. Only then will true healing begin.' He concluded with words of solidarity: 'My deepest condolences to the families of the fallen. We stand with you, knowing that we are here because of your sacrifice. I wish a swift recovery to all the wounded soldiers. And I’ve seen firsthand the power of prayer. Sagui survived because of love — the love and energy from across the nation.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syvton1c1e	2025-02-16T11:54:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/BJJeneAtkx/BJJeneAtkx_112_0_656_369_0_small.jpg

How IDF failed Kfar Aza on October 7, Kibbutz to receive military...	Exclusive: While military set to present full report to kibbutz members next week, details suggest soldiers left area before clearing it allowing terrorists to resume massacre The IDF will next week, release findings on its failures during the October 7 massacre including an internal report on the attack on Kibbutz Kfar Aza, where 64 residents were murdered and 19 kidnapped. The report will be presented to the community, including the families of the victims. The presentation is expected to be highly charged, with investigators acknowledging that 'the IDF failed to defend the kibbutz,' and taking responsibility for the failures. Among the key findings were the killing of at least three civilians by troops. One of the victims had been abducted in his vehicle; soldiers mistakenly believed he was a terrorist and opened fire. The victim’s family was recently informed of the findings, although they had long suspected that he was killed byfriendly fire. Families of those mistakenly killed requested that their names be withheld until the full investigation is completed. Delayed response and tactical failures The report details critical IDF failures, including forces who arrived at the kibbutz who hesitated to engage Hamas terrorists as they awaited further orders. Despite this, the kibbutz community said that 'the soldiers who eventually entered, fought like lions, some knowing they wouldn’t make it out alive. IDF troops saved lives and evacuated civilians.' Another failure was the lack of security after troops initially cleared areas of terrorists but later withdrew, allowing them to return and continue murdering, kidnapping and destroying property. Civilians were also evacuated without proper documentation, making it difficult to track who remained in their homes. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The decision to evacuate residents to a gas station outside the kibbutz also proved to be a mistake, as terrorists were still present in the area. Soldiers stationed at the gas station focused on civilians rather than securing the perimeter. Another lapse in judgment was the unprotected evacuation of kibbutz residents by bus along Route 232. The buses, traveling through an active combat zone, escaped harm by sheer luck. Lack of leadership and coordination At the height of the fighting, at least 20 different IDF units, including elite forces, were deployed in Kfar Aza. However, there was no senior officer overseeing the operation or coordinating units. A full section of the report is dedicated to the attack on one of the kibbutz’ neighborhoods, where some residents were murdered and others abducted. Among those kidnapped from Kfar Aza, Emily Damari and Doron Steinbacher were freed after 471 days in captivity, while Keith Siegel was released after 484 days. 'The reported findings do not portray the official IDF investigation. The investigation has yet to be presented to the kibbutz community, the military told Ynet in a statement. 'The IDF urges the public to refrain from spreading unverified information before an official announcement and to respect the affected communities, bereaved families and the families of the hostages. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1xfv2151g	2025-02-16T11:13:13-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/27/SJGg9pdFfT/SJGg9pdFfT_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
Flying blind: Insights from IAF probe into Oct. 7 failures	Findings show Israel assumed a multi-front offensive when massacre began, deploying most aircraft o the north while struggling to establish situational awareness in the south; key lessons include: implementing new readiness protocols, granting pilots more autonomy, doubling missile defense stockpiles and acquiring light gun-equipped planes The Israeli Air Force (IAF) on Sunday released an internal investigation into the events of the October 7 attack that highlighted both the effectiveness and challenges of its operations during an unforeseen emergency. The assault, which began early that morning, was the largest massacre against Jews since the Holocaust. The following key insights emerged from the probe: Early morning response and delays At 7:10 a.m., IAF commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar arrived at the situation room. In the absence of a clear overview, he decided to raise the Air Force to a state of the highest readiness, meaning full war mode. Transitioning a large, complex force like the Air Force from routine operations to this heightened state took time, requiring logistical and technical adjustments. By 1:00 p.m. on October 7, the Air Force had achieved complete readiness. A primary concern at the time was that then-Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah may have coordinated the attack with then-Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, with forces from Hezbollah’s Radwan Unit and missile systems potentially joining the fighting within hours. At 7:15 a.m., a combat drone above Gaza targeted terrorists near the border fence close to Netiv HaAsara. Shortly after, Air Force fighter jets, on short notice, attacked a tunnel identified by IDF Southern Command intelligence. The tunnel, which was expected to be used by attackers to infiltrate Netiv HaAsara, was destroyed — but no terrorists were found inside. The attack was a result of a broader intelligence blindness, as no on-the-ground guidance was available. In the early critical hours of the day, the Air Force struggled with a lack of clear objectives and insufficient personnel on the ground. Coordination challenges and limited engagement By 7:30 a.m., the first Apache attack helicopter strike targeted terrorists near Kibbutz Re'im, followed by additional attack helicopters from the Ramon Air Base. Delays occurred as pilots, navigators and ground crews needed time to prepare for missions. Furthermore, drone deployments were delayed due to rocket attacks on Air Force bases and the slower speed of drones, which took over an hour to reach battle zones. At 8:10 a.m., the first medical evacuation took place, with 157 casualties airlifted by CH-53 Yas'ur and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, alongside the 669th Airborne Medical Evacuation Unit. By 8:18 a.m., three drones, five helicopters and six fighter jets were all engaged in strikes across Gaza and the border fence area. Combat and expanding rules of engagement At 8:47 a.m., Air Force elite Shaldag troops was deployed by helicopter near Kibbutz Be’eri, immediately entering combat. The intense fighting at Be’eri, in which Shaldag played a significant but controversial role, is under investigation. By 9:30 a.m., a decision was made to expand the rules of engagement to allow strikes on any targets near or west of the border fence, including those suspected of holding hostages. Senior Air Force commanders referred to this as a 'Hannibal Procedure,' where anything moving near the border, without clear identification of friendly forces, would be engaged. Despite this, concerns remained about the possibility of Israeli hostages being involved in the attacks. In one incident, a drone operator hesitated before striking a vehicle, waiting until terrorists abandoned the car and he confirmed no hostages were inside. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Continued air strikes and the Air Force's impact By 10:30 a.m., lacking on-the-ground information, the Air Force continued to follow pre-existing plans, launching strikes on Hamas command centers across Gaza using MK84 bombs. The operation involved continuous Air Force strikes, with 945 bombings and 11,000 shells fired by helicopters by noon. The investigation revealed that out of the 6,000 terrorists involved in the attacks that day, 1,600 were eliminated. Between 700 and 1,000 of these casualties were directly attributed to Air Force strikes, despite operating under heavy uncertainty. Air Force intervention helped mitigate the scale of the disaster in certain cases. Notably, in the Nahal Oz base, 54 soldiers and several female soldiers were killed and some of the female soldiers were abducted. In one instance at Nahal Oz, 11 soldiers were hiding in a building when terrorists attempted to enter. A drone strike forced the terrorists to flee, saving the soldiers. Similarly, early morning Air Force strikes around the 'Black Arrow' memorial neutralized hundreds of terrorists planning to advance deeper into Israeli territory. Key lessons and operational changes The investigation’s main conclusion was that the Air Force’s centralization in such a critical event worked against its effectiveness. The most important lesson was decentralization. On October 7, any Air Force assets in the air — whether drones or helicopters — were responsible for directing all aerial operations, which limited effectiveness. The decision was made to decentralize command in future incidents. The Air Force’s operational logic involves the commander or, in their absence, the deputy commander, directing pilots in the cockpit. As a result, the shift to operational decentralization is almost revolutionary for the Air Force. The idea is to allow pilots and operators in the field to exercise judgment and, in some cases, manage fire operations independently. This change also led to the renaming of the Air Force’s operational wing, which will tailor operations and tools to specific missions and sectors. The new structure allows pilots to take charge of border defense operations in a more integrated manner. The probe’s second key lesson was the need for readiness for large surprise attacks, even with low probability. The Air Force plans to implement a new state of alert that will allow more air assets to be mobilized more quickly in response to emerging crises. The goal is to have significantly more aircraft available in a shorter time frame. This will require more pilots, more ground crews and faster alert systems — though it comes with a significant cost and demand for manpower. The third major lesson was the need for the Air Force to develop the capability to independently gather operational intelligence during a crisis. This would involve acquiring new aircraft which can provide real-time intelligence and striking capabilities. The move would resemble the early days of the Air Force when aircraft were used for observation and targeting. In addition, the Air Force plans to further expand its air defense systems, including Iron Dome and the Arrow missile defense systems, ensuring quicker resupply and maintenance of missile batteries. This will be crucial for the future defense of Israel’s borders. The Air Force is already implementing changes in the way it engages in border defense operations as a result of the probe. The deployment of more drones and helicopters by regional Air Force divisions is now more integrated, alongside improvements in intelligence and communication, which will better connect ground forces and Air Force assets. While these changes will require substantial investment, they are crucial for ensuring the Air Force’s readiness for future unexpected conflicts or wars. The Air Force is now prepared to fulfill its new operational needs, presenting its updated budgetary requirements to the Ministerial Committee on National Security. The Air Force has stressed that the slogan 'never again' must translate into clear actions — more personnel, more aircraft, more intelligence and the resources needed to operate them. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj8mxik5yl	2025-02-16T10:24:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/SkPblKjK1x/SkPblKjK1x_1_0_1920_1080_0_small.jpg
IDF strikes Lebanon as Hezbollah chief warns against delaying wit...	Military says it attacked terror group's sites in the Bekka Valley in response to violations of the ceasefire agreement; Qassem says Lebanese people have the right to confront the Israeli enemy Israel carried out strikes on Hezbollah military sites in the Bekaa Valley, deep inside Lebanon, on Sunday evening, in what it claimed was a response to violations by the terror group of the ceasefire agreement. The strikes took place as Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem delivered a televised speech on Lebanese TV. The operation was conducted with precision, based on intelligence provided by Military Intelligence, and targeted several military sites containing rocket launchers and weapons, where Hezbollah activity had been detected,' the IDF said in a statement. The military said the presence and activity of operatives at these sites constitute a violation of the understanding between Israel and Lebanon. The Lebanese news outlet Al-Jadeed reported that two strikes were carried out in the villages of Khirbet and Halbata. At the same time, and shortly before the deadline for the IDF’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon, explosions were heard in the areas of Shlomi and Nahariya as part of ongoing operations to demolish structures. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In a televised speech, Qassem addressed the U.S. administration's plan to evacuate Gaza’s residents and described President Donald Trump’s stance on the Palestinian issue as 'extremely dangerous.' He accused Trump of seeking to 'end Palestine and the Palestinian people' and labeled these policies 'political genocide.' Qassem further claimed that 'everything Israel does is driven and supported by America' and vowed that displacement to Egypt, Jordan, or any other location would never be accepted, declaring, 'We believe that Palestine stretches from the river to the sea.' Qassem also asserted that 'the Lebanese people have the right to confront the Israeli enemy' and insisted that Israel must complete its withdrawal by February 18. 'It is Lebanon’s responsibility to take all necessary measures to ensure Israel withdraws on time without leaving any presence behind.

The IDF is scheduled to complete its withdrawal from Lebanon by the coming Tuesday. While the military is expected to meet the deadline to withdraw from the villages themselves, Israel has reportedly demanded to retain control of five strategic positions along the border. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syxf2jk5ke	2025-02-16T10:10:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/HklmzIBru1e/HklmzIBru1e_2_0_2999_1688_0_small.jpg

List of alleged 'collaborators' with police spreads in Arab secto...	Security forces warn people mistakenly detailed on document could be ostracization and even murdered; as murders continues to rise in Arab society A list of alleged 'collaborators' with the Israel Police was circulated in Arab communities on Sunday, mainly in central Israel, accusing those named of aiding the police. The list was accompanied by calls to boycott them, refuse to pray or marry them — and even harm them. Some of the individuals named are innocent residents with no ties to crime or law enforcement. 'We're very concerned about this list,' A police source told Ynet. 'We don't know what the anonymous distributors based it on or where they got the names. There's a serious fear that those listed will be harmed. These are innocent people who might pay with their lives due to incitement. A target was painted on their backs.' Arab communities in Israel face high crime rates, largely due to the rise of organized crime and longstanding mistrust between residents and law enforcement. Many crimes go unsolved because witnesses were reluctant to cooperate, fearing retaliation. The term 'collaborator' carries a heavy stigma, historically used against Palestinians accused of aiding Israeli authorities. In the context of crime, it refers to those suspected of providing information to the police, whether true or not. Accusations can lead to severe consequences, including social ostracization, violence or even murder. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The list includes police officers and volunteers, whose security — and that of their families — has been increased. Police have classified them as 'under threat' and are working to track down those responsible for spreading the list which also names known criminals, who are reportedly taking independent action to find those who distributed it. Police have long struggled to solve serious crimes in the Arab sector due to a lack of cooperation. Now they fear the list will deter even those who are willing to assist in investigations. 'This list will intimidate anyone who helps, even if their name isn't on it,' the source added. The police has come under criticizm for failing to control the surge of crime on Arab streets and have accused then National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir of allowing Arabs to be killed and neglecting their safety. Since the beginning of the year, 31 people in Arab communities have been murdered and three others have been killed by police. None of the murders have been solved and no arrests have been made. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1130fkcyg	2025-02-16T09:12:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/09/15/rkvlEqu111T/rkvlEqu111T_0_64_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Regarding U.S. President Donald Trump’s reported plan to relocate Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, Qassem said: 'His positions on the Palestinian issue are extremely dangerous and aim to end Palestine and the Palestinian people.

Cabinet to discuss phase 2 of Gaza deal, Witkoff says it 'is abso...	U.S. special envoy says phase two includes return of 19 live IDF soldiers among others and while it contemplates an end of the war it also contemplates Hamas not being involved in Gaza Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff that he will convene the security cabinet on Monday to discuss phase 2 of the cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said on Sunday evening. The announcement came shortly after Witkoff said in an interview that the talks on phase 2 have already begun and are expected to continue. The next phase of the cease-fire agreement includes the return of all hostages held by Hamas in exchange to an end to the war and a complete withdrawal of IDF troops from Gaza. 'Phase two is absolutely going to begin,' Witkoff told Fox.'I've had very productive and constructive talks on Sunday with Netanyahu, Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Al Thani and Egypt's director of intelligence about the sequencing of phase two, setting forth positions on both sides, so we can understand ... where we are today, and then continuing talks this week at a location to be determined so that we can figure out how we get to the end of phase two successfully,' Witkoff said.' 'Phase 2 Includes 19 IDF soldiers we believe all of them are alive and some others as well, it includes Edan Alexander who of course we've been pressing for because he is an American and Israel citizen as well so it includes all of these people it also includes getting the families back the bodies of family members of their families who have died.' Witkoff said the next phase of the deal was more intricate and complicated. 'Phase 2 contemplates an end of the war but it also contemplates Hamas not being involved in Gaza and being gone from Gaza.' The PMO also announced that a delegation would leave for Cairo on Monday to discuss the hostage deal's second phase. 'The delegation will receive guidelines for further talks after the Security Cabinet convenes on Monday.' Last week Netanyahu denied reports that negotiations had begun, even contradicting Likud chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Yuli Edelstein who told the families of hostages that Israel was discussing the next phase of the deal. Netanyahu's coalition partner Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has warned that such an agreement would result in his party's resignation from the government. Earlier Netanyahu met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. After the meeting Netanyahu said he and U.S. President Donald Trump were working in full coordination. 'We have a common strategy and we can’t always share details of this strategy with the public,' he said, 'including when the gates of hell will be opened, as they surely will if all our hostages are not released, until the last one of them.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1kst5k9kl	2025-02-16T08:21:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/16/ByzE78k9yl/ByzE78k9yl_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Israeli musicians arrested in thailand for 'illegal performance'	Incident in Northern city of Pai during raid on Jazz club hosting foreign performers without propoer permits; Thai authorities have arrested four foreign musicians, including two Israelis, for performing without the required permits at a club in the northern town of Pai, officials said. The arrests took place during a Thursday night raid on the Jazz House Pai club, conducted by Immigration Police Region 5 in Chiang Mai, the Mae Hong Son Provincial Police, the local employment office, and the Internal Security Agency. Authorities said the musicians tried to flee through the club's back exit but were quickly apprehended. Last month, four Israelis faced deportation after they were accused of disruptive and violent behavior at the Pai hospital. Daniel, Aviv and Or Emanoel and Dan Nisko admit to charges of causing public nuisance, intimidation, harassment and disgraceful conduct. The group included an Israeli drummer and guitarist. One of the detainees, Shai Deri, identified himself in a Facebook post, saying he had been held for several days. 'I was arrested after playing music with some friends,' Deri wrote. 'I've been in jail for four days already, and next week I'll probably be deported from Thailand. Life has its reasons; we'll find out more later. Thank you all for the support and love in this unfair situation. It is what it is. We only have access to a phone for one hour a day, so I'm unavailable most of the time.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Authorities said the club had been hosting performances by three foreign bands: Walk the Dog 2, Pink Fraud, and Mizu and Branda. All four musicians were charged with working without permits and failing to report their employment within the 15-day window required by Thai labor law. The club owner is also expected to face legal action for employing foreign workers without authorization. The raid followed a meeting last month between the Mae Hong Son immigration office and community representatives in Pai, a popular tourist destination known for its laid-back atmosphere and live music scene. Residents at the meeting voiced concerns about the illegal employment of foreigners and its impact on local tourism. Authorities said they urged locals to report suspected cases of unlawful employment, except for workers from neighboring countries. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjasrujqyx	2025-02-16T06:48:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2018/08/30/8744671/8744671_0_0_1000_667_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu and Rubio: Israel is coordinated with Trump, including ...	Prime minister and US secretary of state meet in Jerusalem and issue joint statement; Netanyahu emphasizes that he has 'made it clear Iran must not have nuclear weapons' and that Hamas must not pose a threat to Israel; Rubio says Iran is the major source of instability in the region and Hamas cannot remain dominant force in Gaza In the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's ultimatum to Gaza terrorists 'to release all the hostages,' which expired Saturday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Sunday morning in his office in Jerusalem with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The two later held an extended meeting, which was attended by, among others, government ministers Ron Dermer and Gideon Saar, National Security Council Chairman Tzachi Hanegbi, and Aryeh Deri. After the extended meeting, the prime minister and the U.S. secretary of state issued a joint statement. At the beginning of the statement, Netanyahu emphasized that he and U.S. President Donald Trump 'are working in full coordination. We have a common strategy and we can’t always share details of this strategy with the public,' he says, 'including when the gates of hell will be opened, as they surely will if all our hostages are not released, until the last one of them.' He added that Israel is 'committed to freeing all of our hostages, eliminating Hamas' military and governing capabilities, and ensuring that Gaza will never again constitute a threat to Israel.' Netanyahu also addressed the situation in Syria and Lebanon, adding: 'Israel will act to prevent any threat from emerging in southwest Syria,' and said that 'Israel is committed to the cease-fire and the understandings we reached in November with Lebanon, and expects the government of Lebanon to be equally committed.' Regarding the Iranian threat, Netanyahu said: 'We have made it clear that Iran must not have nuclear weapons.' Rubio referred in his opening remarks to Trump's ultimatum to the terror groups in Gaza, which has already expired, and emphasized that Trump was very clear that the 'hostages need to come home, they need to be released.' 'This is a shared goal, and we are working on it very closely,' Rubio said. Regarding the president's plan to evacuate Gaza, Rubio said that the president has also been very bold about his view of what the future of Gaza should be, says Rubio, referring to Trump’s proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza and have the U.S. take over the Strip. 'Not the same old tired ideas of the past,' he continues. 'Something that is new, something that frankly took courage and vision in order to outline. It may have surprised and shocked many, but what cannot continue is the same cycle to repeat over and over again and wind up in the exact same place.' Trump, Rubio says, ' 'has been very clear that Hamas cannot continue as a government or military force, and frankly as long as it stands as a force that can govern, as a force that can administer, or as a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible.' 'It must be eradicated, it must be eliminated,' Rubio added. Regarding the president's plan to evacuate the Strip, he added: 'This vision will surprise many. It is impossible to continue on the same path over and over again. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Rubio also noted that he also spoke with Netanyahu about the situation in Syria: 'If you replace one armed force with another, that is not a positive development. We will examine this very closely.' Regarding the cease-fire in Lebanon, the U.S. secretary of state said that it is necessary to ensure that Hezbollah disarms. Regarding Iran, he added: 'Iran is the greatest single force of instability in the region.' Iran is 'behind every terrorist group, behind every act of violence.' Rubio's visit to Israel will also focus on talks to continue the hostage deal, a program to encourage voluntary migration of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, the cease-fire in Lebanon, and the Iranian threat. Ahead of his visit, the State Department said Rubio would also focus on 'the release of American citizens and all other hostages held by Hamas, and advancing the second phase of the Gaza cease-fire agreement.' Rubio, who arrived in Israel for a two-day visit, will then fly to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where Arab countries are expected to present him with an alternative plan for the Gaza Strip, in place of the one proposed by Trump. On Saturday night, Netanyahu held a security consultation with the participation of Defense Minister Israel Katz, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, and representatives of the negotiating team. All heads of the defense establishment support the continuation of the implementation of Phase I of the deal, including Minister Katz. He supports this position, according to which we should continue on track and remove as many hostages alive from Gaza as possible. At the same time, the senior officials say that in the event of Hamas violating the agreement, the fighting will be different and much more intense. The latest discussions focused on trying to return the six remaining living hostages who are set to be freed during from Phase I in the coming week, and perhaps even expanding the deal to include hostages who are supposed to return in Phase II, in exchange for sending humanitarian aid during Ramadan. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyg3gw15jg	2025-02-16T04:52:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/16/rkLSBUy5ye/rkLSBUy5ye_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Herzi Halevi will arrive in the US for an official and final visit as he concludes his term, where he will meet with senior Pentagon officials and discuss coordination with them against threats led by Iran The IDF spokesman announced that outgoing Chief of Staff, Maj. Gen. Herzi Halevi, will depart Sunday night for an official visit to the United States through Thursday. During the visit, he will meet with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Commander of CENTCOM, and senior US military officials. They will discuss 'key strategic and operational issues,' according to the IDF spokesman. The position of the Chief of the General Staff will be filled by Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Maj. Gen. Amir Baram, during the visit. 'During the Iron Swords War, cooperation between the two militaries has been exceptional. The Chief of the General Staff will take the opportunity to express his gratitude to his counterparts for their support, commitment and personal ties. Additionally, he will explore ways to further enhance this cooperation,' the IDF said in a statement. The visit to the US will be the last official visit by Halevi, who announced his resignation last month. About a week and a half ago, the commander of the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), Gen. Michael E. Kurilla, visited Israel and met with Halevi. An IDF spokesman said at the time that, during the visit, the commanders held a discussion with the participation of senior army officials, which dealt with assessing the regional strategic situation and examining courses of action to continue dealing with the threats in the Middle East, while cooperating between the armies. Even before that, ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's inauguration in January, Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, Kurilla's deputy, landed in Israel. At that time, the parties discussed critical weapons shipments that the U.S., under former President Joe Biden, had frozen, as well as improving preparedness for a possible joint US-led attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. Meanwhile, two days ago, the Washington Post reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had discussed with Trump several options for American support for Israel in the fight against Iran's nuclear program . Among other things, the two discussed backing an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities - from active military support such as intelligence, refueling or any other assistance - to a more severe diplomatic ultimatum than today.

Ignatius quoted American and Israeli officials who said that if Iran does not agree to abandon its nuclear facilities 'Libyan style,' Israel intends to bomb them 'with or without U.S. support.' Even before that, American media outlets published intelligence reports according to which the U.S. estimates that Israel will attack Iranian nuclear facilities in the first half of 2025.

Israeli Air Force strike near Philadelphi Corridor kills two Hama...	An Israeli airstrike near the Philadelphi Corridor kills two and injures three, according to Gaza sources; IDF stated the strike targeted 'armed individuals' advancing toward troops, reiterating warnings for Gaza residents to avoid approaching deployed forces Israeli Air Force jets struck several armed Palestinians who were moving toward IDF troops near the Philadelphi Corridor in the Gaza Strip on Sunday morning. According to reports from Gaza, two of the terrorists were killed and three others injured in the strike, which the reports claimed targeted Hamas-affiliated police officers securing the entry of aid trucks in eastern Rafah. The IDF Spokesperson Unit said in a statement that 'Several armed individuals moving toward IDF troops in the southern Gaza Strip were struck by an IAF aircraft. Hits were identified.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Before the airstrike occurred, the Gaza Ministry of Communications claimed that 'Israel has still not committed to bringing the essential equipment into the Gaza Strip.' Officials in the Hamas-run ministry told the Qatari channel Al-Araby that 'Israel's failure to meet the terms of the agreement puts the mediators in an embarrassing position.' The Qatari channel’s report referred to caravans waiting at the Rafah crossing, which were supposed to enter Sunday, as well as heavy equipment. According to Hamas, the delay in allowing the equipment to enter is holding up the agreement. 'Pressure must be applied on Israel to commit to the agreement, particularly regarding the humanitarian protocol,' officials from the organization said. Hamas had previously announced a unilateral suspension of the hostage deal but later reversed its decision. Hamas conditioned the continuation of the deal on Israel's commitment to ensuring the flow of humanitarian aid would continue beyond Saturday. Mediators assessed that the crisis was resolved. Hamas senior official Mahmoud Mardawi told Al-Araby at the time, 'The cease-fire agreement does not require further negotiations, only implementation. We do not want to add anything to the agreement, and we will adhere to everything we signed.' Mardawi added: 'There have been guarantees from the outset, and what we need is the enemy's commitment to fulfilling its obligations. The resistance is committed to the agreement, contrary to Israel's claims. There are positive signs, but we want practical steps to ensure the implementation of the agreement. Forced displacement and expulsion will not happen, and our people will not leave the Gaza Strip.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkdcknkqjg	2025-02-16T02:14:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/06/03/r1Lq2Sj4A/r1Lq2Sj4A_230_496_2433_1370_0_small.jpg
Stabbing 'linked to ISIS': Attack in Austria by Syrian migrant wa...	Austrian investigators have confirmed that Saturday's attack in the city of Villach, in which a 14-year-old boy was killed and five other bystanders were injured, was an Islamist-inspired stabbing attack. The attacker, a 23-year-old Syrian asylum seeker, shocked Europe when he was filmed smiling broadly in aftermath of attack The perpetrator of a stabbing attack on Saturday in the southern Austrian town of Villach in which a teenage boy was killed was a suspected Islamist who was radicalized online, Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said on Sunday. Police have identified the perpetrator of the attack as a 23-year-old Syrian asylum seeker. Speaking at a press conference, Karner said the stabbing rampage, in which five people were also injured, was linked to Islamic State. The stabbing suspect was arrested yesterday afternoon after killing a 14-year-old boy and wounding five others. Witnesses said he grabbed a knife and stabbed passersby at random in the heart of the city. In a photo after his arrest, which shocked Europe, he is seen smiling broadly. Two of the five injured are hospitalized in serious condition. A police spokesman said that one of the injured is a Turkish citizen and the rest hold Austrian citizenship. 'This is an Islamist attack with links to ISIS,' Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Kerner said Sunday afternoon. In a statement to the media, he said that the Syrian terrorist had been radicalized online 'in a short time' and was not known to the authorities.

Hezbollah condemns attack by its supporters on UN peacekeeping mi...	Hezbollah on Sunday condemned an attack on a United Nations Interim Force (UNIFIL) convoy in Beirut that took place on Friday which the U.S. State Department has said was reportedly carried out by supporters of the terror group. UNIFIL said on Friday its outgoing deputy force commander was injured when the convoy, which was taking peacekeepers to Beirut airport, was 'violently attacked. Lebanese authorities have detained more than 25 people as part of an investigation into the attack, which the U.S State Department said was carried out 'reportedly by a group of Hezbollah supporters.' In Sunday's statement, the Iran-backed terror group expressed firm rejection to any targeting of UNIFIL forces. Separately, it also denounced the Lebanese army for firing tear gas on Saturday at protesters of the group who were protesting against Lebanon blocking an Iranian flight to Beirut this week after accusations by the Israeli military that Tehran was using civilian aircraft to smuggle cash to Beirut to arm the Lebanese group. It called on the Lebanese military to open a probe into what it described as an 'unjustified assault on peaceful civilians.' Iran barred Lebanese planes from repatriating dozens of Lebanese nationals stranded in Iran on Friday, in a standoff between the two countries following what Tehran described as an Israeli threat to attack it.

President Gustavo Petro has linked the signs of life received from Israeli-Colombian hostage Elkana Bohbot with the Palestinian issue, once again condemning Israel for its military campaign in Gaza and dismissing idea of Palestinian relocation: 'Humanity cannot allow the displacement of people after genocide' Colombian President Gustavo Petro addressed the proof of life received from Hamas-held hostage Elkana Bohbot, who also holds Colombian citizenship, while expressing solidarity with the Palestinians and their right of return to Israel, which would essentially mean the end of the Jewish state. 'Information has been obtained regarding the condition of Israeli-Colombian citizen Elkana Bohbot. We hope for his imminent release. His freedom is a tribute to Colombia and its solidarity with the Palestinian people,' Petro said in a post on the X social media platform. Additionally, Petro posted a video on the X platform from a hospital for Gazan children in Qatar, where he is seen holding a picture of the map of Israel, featuring a key symbolizing the Palestinian right of return. Petro added: 'I hope his (Elkana's) reunited family can come to Colombia. I hope his son, whom I met in my office, experiences very happy days. May his pain fade away.' In a tweet posted on X on Friday, the Colombian president mentioned his visit to the hospital and said: 'I embraced their broken and healing bodies, looked into their eyes and saw hope in them. The hope of the world after genocide.' 'Together with our ambassador in Qatar, a descendant of a Palestinian father, we are working on a pathway to bring children from Gaza to Colombia so they can fully recover,' he added. 'Humanity cannot allow the displacement of a people after genocide. All of humanity must contribute in solidarity to the rehabilitation of Gaza, which includes rebuilding homes, streets and buildings, but fundamentally involves restoring the social fabric of a nation, an ancient culture, a specific part of humanity called the Palestinian people. Gaza is Palestine, period. On Saturday, during an event at Hostages’ Square, Rivka Bohbot, the wife of Elkana, spoke and said: 'I am speaking tonight on behalf of him and our son, Re'em David, who is four and a half years old.' According to her, 'Elkana wanted a happy life for us. He worked hard to save money and worked in production for the Nova festival. Even in his last moments of freedom, instead of fleeing, he chose to help others. Only after dozens of lives were saved because of him, was he kidnapped.' She added: 'This week, we received proof of life — Elkana is alive but suffering under inhumane conditions. I promise you, we won't stop until you come back.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In May of last year, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu clashed with the Colombian president on X, where Petro has taken a very harsh line against Israel since the outbreak of the war, culminating earlier this month in the severing of diplomatic relations between the two countries. During the Gaza campaign, Petro frequently attacked Israel, calling its leaders — particularly Netanyahu — 'monsters' and 'genocidal murderers.' Israel’s embassy in Colombia responded to these accusations on several occasions. In the same month, Petro tweeted that 'Netanyahu is genocidal. The world's court of justice says so and his ruling must be obeyed.' In November, the ICC indeed issued arrest warrants against Netanyahu and then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Petro also added at the time: 'The Security Council must begin considering the establishment of a peacekeeping force for the territory in the Gaza Strip.' Netanyahu did not remain silent and, in response, tweeted in English to his 2.4 million followers: 'Israel will not be lectured by an antisemitic supporter of Hamas, a genocidal terrorist organization that massacred, raped, mutilated and burned alive 1,200 innocent people on October 7.

Trump administration talks with the Kremlin spark Ukrainian fears...	White House officials meet Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia to discuss ending the war in Ukraine; Ukrainian leaders worry about being sidelined in talks that could lead to agreements lacking strong security guarantees and mean territorial concessions for Kyiv U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff are expected to meet this week with official Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia to discuss a path to ending the war in Ukraine, according to The New York Times. The report noted these are the first significant talks between the two world powers regarding the conflict. Senior Trump administration officials will hold meetings with Russian delegates, even as Ukrainian leaders express concern over a potentially problematic agreement. The meeting will occur less than a week after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Following their conversation, Trump told reporters that discussions on ending the war in Ukraine would be held in Saudi Arabia. The plans for this week’s meetings in Riyadh were provided by someone familiar with the schedule. On Friday, Rubio and Vice President J.D. Vance met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. On Saturday, Rubio also spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov while Rubio was en route to Israel. Their conversation marked the final step in the Trump administration’s effort to counter former President Joe Biden’s attempt to diplomatically isolate Russia. Rubio 'confirmed President Trump’s commitment to finding an end to the conflict in Ukraine,' said Tammy Bruce, spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, summarizing the call. 'In addition, they discussed the possibility of working together on several other bilateral issues.' According to the Russian summary of the conversation, the two foreign ministers agreed to address obstacles to cooperation on a range of topics created by the Biden administration. It was also noted that Rubio and Lavrov will hold regular talks and prepare for a summit between Presidents Trump and Putin, with both governments working to restore the operations of their respective diplomatic missions. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Russian summary further stated that both sides are committed to engaging on current international issues, including settlements near Ukraine, the situation in the Israel region, the broader Middle East, and other areas. On Wednesday, Trump announced that he had spoken by phone with Putin — the first time he unambiguously and in detail confirmed that he had spoken with the Russian leader. This call comes after years during which Western leaders, including Biden, avoided direct conversations with Putin following the invasion of Ukraine. In recent weeks, officials on both sides had hinted at such discussions without giving specific dates or further details. In a post on his social network, Truth Social, Trump stated that the two leaders discussed issues concerning Ukraine. 'Deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine.

We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations,' Trump wrote in the post. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryofwz1qye	2025-02-15T23:33:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/07/H1BPotqZyg/H1BPotqZyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

'Represents a significant asset,' said the defense minister, who thanked the Trump administration for the 'unwavering support of the State of Israel'; Another shipment is now on its way to Israel, now that the embargo has been lifted - 132 D9 bulldozers The Defense Ministry announced Sunday morning that a shipment of heavy bombs released by the Trump administration has arrived in Israel. The shipment, which contained approximately 1,600 MK-84 heavy munitions, was transferred to Air Force bases throughout the country. Defense Minister Israel Katz said that this 'represents a significant asset for the Air Force and the IDF,' and thanked U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration for their 'unwavering support of the State of Israel.' The Defense Ministry spokeswoman said that the shipment to Israel was carried out in a joint operation, led by the Israel Ministry of Defense (IMOD) Mission to the United States and the International Transportation Authority Unit of the Ministry’s Defense Procurement Directorate. The Israel Ministry of Defense continues to procure and transport munitions for the IDF,' the Defense Ministry said in a statement. 'To date, over 76,000 tons of military equipment have arrived in Israel via 678 airlifts and 129 sea shipments. This represents the largest air and sea bridge in Israel's history.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​.' Defense Minister Israel Katz said that 'the munitions shipment that arrived in Israel tonight, released by the Trump Administration, represents a significant asset for the Air Force and the IDF and serves as further evidence of the strong alliance between Israel and the United States.' Katz added that he recently spoke with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who 'reaffirmed America's commitment to continue providing Israel with all necessary tools to ensure its security.' 'I thank President Donald Trump and the U.S. Administration for their unwavering support of the State of Israel. We will continue working together to strengthen our security,' Katz also said. ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Another shipment containing 132 D9 bulldozers, from which the embargo also has been lifted, is now on its way to Israel. Those bulldozers were purchased from Caterpillar Inc. and the Biden administration froze their transfer. Last month, after Trump entered the White House, the embargo on the two shipments in question was lifted. Trump wrote on his Truth Social account that 'many things that were ordered and paid for by Israel, but not shipped by Biden, are now on their way.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The bombs for the Air Force, which the defense establishment had already purchased from Boeing - in shekels and not in aid dollars - weighing close to a ton per bomb, were frozen by the Biden administration on the grounds that the IDF might harm the local civilian population with them. The decision to freeze them was made shortly before the start of the ground operation in Rafah, due to American concerns about the use of these bombs in such a densely populated area. The use of the D9 bulldozer to flatten buildings in the Gaza Strip led to major internal criticism in the U.S., protests and tremendous pressure on the Biden administration, which then froze the move for months. The results on the ground were evident in both theaters of war: An investigation conducted by Ynet in November revealed that many dozens of existing D9 bulldozers, which were most active during the IDF's operations in the Gaza Strip for months between November 2023 and the beginning and middle of last year, require maintenance. These bulldozers were also needed in southern Lebanon. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syhxpw15yl	2025-02-15T22:35:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/16/BJ113SKb1qkg/BJ113SKb1qkg_100_0_1120_630_0_small.jpg

4 Israelis injured in Brooklyn apartment fire, 1 critically	Fire broke out in a rented apartment near the Chabad World Center, where 19 Israeli yeshiva students were staying, apparently caused by a radiator plugged into an electrical outlet; The fire injured four Israelis, one critically, and three firefighters. An Israeli who survived the fire said he was traumatized: 'The only thing that survived was the tefillin and the passport' Four Israeli yeshiva students were injured in a fire that broke out on the second floor of an apartment they rented near the Chabad World Center in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. One of them, a 20-year-old from Lod, is in critical condition after fainting and being trapped in the burning apartment for about 20 minutes. In addition to the yeshiva students, three firefighters were also slightly injured. Eyewitnesses who were at the scene told Ynet that the fire department initially declared the 20-year-old dead, but rescue teams managed to revive him, and he is now hospitalized in a Manhattan hospital in critical and life-threatening condition. Another yeshiva student, a 20-year-old from Jerusalem, was moderately injured, and two other young men were lightly injured and are hospitalized in a Queens hospital. The fire, which was apparently caused by an outdoor radiator plugged into an electrical outlet, started while the students were sleeping and spread quickly. The apartment, where 19 students were living, was completely engulfed in flames, and all their personal belongings were burned. 'We are all still in shock,' one of them said. 'It all happened so fast.' One of the students who survived said that it was a 'total trauma. Three guys jumped out of the window into the yard, and one fell on his face. Two were completely covered in soot, one had his face completely peeled off. It was terrible.' The student added that 'I saw someone trapped for 15 minutes as the roo burned. It was just terrible, A neighbor poured a bucket of water on him, that may have saved his life. They took him out of the room after 20 minutes, passed out. He looked like a piece of coal.' The student who survived the fire added that 'it's a three-apartment building with 19 guys - including the four who were injured. All my clothes were destroyed, the only thing that was saved was the tefillin and the passport. We were given half an hour to take what we could take, to save what we could. We were on the first floor, which somehow suffered the least damage, and everything was still black, everything was sooty. I tried to lift the mattress of the bed and it was impossible. Everything was gone - the mattress, the clothes.' 'The consulate is taking care of new passports for us, because there are guys flying this week,' he explained.

These are the 14 remaining hostages to return in Phase I of the d...	Sasha, Yair and Sagui were released, but 73 hostages are still held captive by Hamas; Israel wants to bring the current phase to an end early, in the belief that Hamas will blow up the agreement; In addition, expanding Phase I to include additional humanitarian aid during Ramadan is being considered Two final rounds of hostage release remain until the end of Phase I of the current cease-fire and hostage deal release, but Hamas still holds 73 hostages, including 36 who have been declared dead. And it is not at all clear whether Phase I will be fully implemented, and it is certainly not known whether Phase II will be implemented at all. After the ultimatum that U.S. President Donald Trump issued to Hamas, to release 'all the hostages', the terrorist organization released only three - Sasha Troufanov , Sagui Dekel-Chen and Iair Horn - and Israel did not object. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Saturday night that he will convene the political-security cabinet 'as soon as possible, to decide on Israel's next steps.' At least according to the heads of the defense establishment, these next steps should be the implementation of Phase I of the deal. Defense Minister Israel Katz also supports this position, under which the path should be continued and as many hostages as possible should be taken out of Gaza alive. At the same time, senior defense officials said that, in the event of Hamas violating the agreement, the fighting would be different and much more intense. Discussions are now focused on attempting to return the six hostages identified as alive in Phase I in the coming week, and perhaps even expanding that phase with hostages who are expected to return in Phase II- by providing additional humanitarian aid during Ramadan. A senior government official said, 'The goal right now is to fight for the return of the six hostages alive in one go instead of two, with the expectation that Hamas will blow up the agreement toward the end. We are already on chicken legs. The goal is to return six hostages alive and also several bodies before the first phase is even over.' If, despite the Israeli will, there is no change in the next stages - then this coming Saturday three living hostages will be released. The following Saturday, in the last week of Phase I, nine additional hostages will be released - one living hostage and eight more who have died, as well as Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who have been held in Gaza for more than a decade. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The list of 14 hostages included in Phase I and who have not yet been released includes - in addition to Mengistu and A-Sayed - four more hostages who are defined as sick and wounded: Omer Wenkert, Eliya Cohen, Tal Shoham and Omer Shem Tov. Also included are Shiri Bibas and her children Ariel and Kfir, whom the IDF emphasizes that there is grave concern for their fate; Shlomo Mansour, who the IDF announced last week was murdered on October 7; Itzik Elgert, whose brother Danny said that there is great fear for his life; and also Ohad Yahalomi, Oded Lifshiz and Tsahi Idan. The hostages who were released in recent weeks have returend with signs of life from many hostages who are still in captivity - and who are not included in the list in the first phase of releases. The list of hostages who are defined as alive and are to be released in Phase II includes Eitan Horn - the brother of Iair who was released Saturday; Matan Zanguaker; Ziv and Gali Berman, Ariel and David Cunio, Elkana Buhbot, Bar Kuperstein, Segev Kalfon, Eitan Mor, Alon Ohel, Yosef Haim Ohana, Avinatan Or, Maxim Harkin, Rom Braslavski, Eviatar David, Guy Gilboa Dalal, Idan Alexander, Matan Angrest, Nimrod Cohen, Tamir Nimrodi and Omri Miran. In an attempt to appease U.S. President Donald Trump, Netanyahu said in an official statement - his only since the release of the hostages - that he 'greatly appreciates President Trump's leadership and the ongoing coordination with the United States. The combination of the reinforcement of IDF forces around the Gaza Strip and President Trump's firm stance led to the release of three of our hostages today - despite earlier Hamas' refusal to release them. The prime minister also appreciates the president's full support for Israel's decisions regarding the Gaza Strip going forward.' Netanyahu held a security consultation Saturday night, as the deadline set by Trump for Hamas expired. On Sunday, after the cabinet meeting, another security discussion is expected, this time about Ramadan, which will begin in about two weeks. On Sunday afternoon, the prime minister will meet with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who landed in Israel Saturday night for his first visit since taking office. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skka8qrf1x	2025-02-15T14:29:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/Bkwz000Atkx/Bkwz000Atkx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

The extension of the cease-fire agreement with Hezbollah will expire in three days, and the defense establishment is optimistic about the implementation of the rest agreement, and estimates that the withdrawal of forces from southern Lebanon will be completed in the coming days, parallel to the deployment of the Lebanese army in these areas under the supervision of the U.S. mechanism. A critical meeting was held between the two sides over the weekend, with the participation of American officers and UNIFIL leaders. The sides described it as successful, with agreement on the IDF's withdrawal from the Shiite villages on the demarcation line. At the same time, Israel insists on militarily controlling five strategic points along the border, on the Lebanese side, because they have control over observation sites and lines of fire, as well as infiltration routes into nearby Israeli communities. The sides are expected to hold final negotiations on this in the coming days, and Israel has not ruled out the possibility of a further extension of the cease-fire. The IDF has already been gradually withdrawing from most areas in southern Lebanon in recent weeks, parallel to the withdrawal of Lebanese army forces into the area. Either way, the effort to complete the negotiations and withdrawal corresponds with the plan at the political and military levels to return the population evacuated from the Galilee in the north to their homes in as little as two weeks. At the same time, the IDF is expected to continue its aggressive enforcement of the cease-fire, as it has been in recent days deep inside Lebanon and north of the Litani River, and also to prevent the transfer of weapons or support from Iran to Hezbollah.

'The IAF conducted a precise and intelligence-based strike on a central terrorist in Hezbollah’s aerial unit in the area of southern Lebanon,' the IDF said in a statement. 'The terrorist was targeted after repeatedly violating the understandings between Israel and Lebanon over the past few weeks, including his role in leading the launch of UAVs toward Israeli territory.' Lebanese media confirmed that Hamoud was killed in a car attack in the village of Jarjua, in the Nabatieh region in southern Lebanon, and reported that Ahmed Farhat was also killed alongside him. Lebanon's Ministry of Health claimed that five people, including two children, were injured in the attack. Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Israel would consider to strike back against attacks from Lebanon. 'As I warned - if there are drones, there will be no Hezbollah,' Katz said. 'We will not allow the reality of drone launches toward the State of Israel. The launch of the drones constitutes crossing a red line and a blatant violation of the cease-fire agreement between Israel and Lebanon. We will continue with the policy of strong enforcement against any violation of the cease-fire and protect the security of the residents of the Galilee; We will not allow a return to the reality of October 7.' His office reported that 'the minister instructed the IDF to act firmly against those responsible for the drone launches from Lebanon.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h11p1k0k1e	2025-02-15T12:11:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/r14mUOoY1l/r14mUOoY1l_0_136_1601_901_0_small.jpg

Of course, there is a desire for revenge – but is it the right p...	After 15 months of excruciating pain in Hamas captivity, Romi Gonen returned to her mother’s arms in an emotional embrace that became a national symbol; Her mother, Merav Leshem Gonen, reveals the relentless agony, the untreated wounds, and the harrowing fight to reclaim her life To the untrained eye, it was hard to see the pain she carried from captivity. But after a year and three months in Gaza’s darkness, Romi Gonen managed to keep her composure on the day of her release, gritted her teeth, and refused to show the world how much she was truly suffering. Her injury alone attests to the immense pain she endured and the extent to which her captors ensured she experienced repeated episodes of agony and prolonged abuse. 'As a result of the gunshot wound, Romi's right hand was paralyzed and is nonfunctional,' says her mother, Merav Leshem Gonen. She will now require a very complex and intricate surgery, followed by a long and difficult rehabilitation. 'No one knows if her hand will regain function or in what condition it will be. Romi is still in pain today. For a year and three months, my daughter suffered excruciating pain. She wasn’t given any painkillers or medication – nothing. She endured it all, raw, until she returned. Romi is right-handed, and now she has switched to writing with her left hand. We are hoping with all our hearts that her hand will recover, and right now, we are entirely focused on that goal.' Emotional turmoil in the fight to bring her daughter home Merav Leshem Gonen endured countless emotional upheavals during her journey to secure the release of her daughter, Romi, from Hamas captivity, which ended two and a half weeks ago during the first phase of the hostage release deal. But one particular, sweet emotional shock arrived a week after her daughter’s return: Romi’s name appeared on her mobile screen for the first time since October 7, 2023. An incoming call from Romi Gonen – who could have imagined? 'I looked at the screen and didn’t know what to do with myself,' she smiles. 'I was in total shock. It took Romi about four days before she even touched the new phone. She didn’t want to deal with it since her old phone was taken to Gaza. It took a week before she called me. And then I thought, 'what a moment. It’s the first time she has called me since the captivity.'' 'I heard her being kidnapped, and she heard my helplessness at that moment' The last time before that was during her abduction from the Nova music festival. Her release from captivity revealed new details that she shared with her mother about moments when her life was on the line, between Israeli soil and Gaza. 'Literally, I heard her being kidnapped, and she heard my helplessness at that moment,' Leshem Gonen recalls. 'We haven’t fully gone through everything that happened, but today I know that during that phone call at the time of the abduction, Romi lost consciousness several times. I didn’t know that then. With her was Ofir Sarfati, of blessed memory, who was gravely injured. Romi used one hand to cover the large wound he had from the gunfire. These are things we only know now – how heroic Ofir was and how he protected the girls he didn’t even know. That is mutual responsibility at its finest.' And Ben Shimony also tried to help there. 'Right. There was incredible bravery. No one knew about Ofir’s role except Romi. Everyone was waiting for her to come back to tell his story. I also know now that Romi’s injury, as we all suspected without proof, was severe. Her right hand was immediately paralyzed due to the gunshot wound and completely nonfunctional.' We’ve heard about the ongoing abuse suffered by Yarden Bibas, Keith Siegel, Ofer Calderon, and other hostages who were released in the previous deal. What can you share from what Romi has told you about her captivity? 'It’s all still very preliminary. Romi is an incredibly funny person, so even the hardest things – she tends to tell them with humor. She downplays things, which is sometimes awful (laughs). But it makes it easier to listen, and it helps her open up. She lost about 10 kilograms in captivity – an extreme amount for someone like her, who was already light to begin with. She lost muscle mass to an alarming degree, returning with almost no body fat. All the things we are so concerned about in daily life. She suffered from severe malnutrition in captivity, meaning deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals, which dramatically increase the risk of heart complications – even for a completely healthy 24-year-old. At any moment, she could have gone into cardiac arrhythmia and simply died just from the malnutrition she endured in captivity.' 'The sanitary conditions were horrifying, and we’re talking about women. Showering was rare, and when it happened, it was with a single cup of water – just pouring it over yourself. It’s surreal. The terrorists hid food from them and deliberately starved them. Romi had no exposure to sunlight at all, whether she was held in tunnels or houses. She never saw daylight, never stepped into the sun. She came back completely pale. Today, she’s finally regained some color, and most of the time what she enjoys most is taking sun baths outside—just sitting and absorbing vitamin D, fresh air and open spaces. For us, this seems natural, but to her, it’s a gift. It’s also the ability to appreciate what she has and to say thank you for it.' We keep hearing more and more accounts of the psychological torment the hostages endured. 'Romi has mentioned that as well. While her wound was still open, they would give her something to disinfect it – but they would stand there laughing as she suffered. I think these stories are eerily similar across all the hostages. These are horrors we still cannot fully comprehend.' And yet, that mischievous spark in her eyes hasn’t faded. 'No. She came back incredibly determined to be strong and to create a life she experiences with joy. You can see it in her. Romi is someone who finds joy in daily life. But today, I see something different in her maturity. For example, she decided that, even in frustrating situations, she chooses to breathe and try to accept things.' 'We used to joke that when Romi was frustrated or angry it was best to keep your distance. But she’s not like that anymore. Now, even in moments of frustration, she chooses a different path, and that’s incredible. If she can do it, so can we.' Being held together in captivity turned Romi Gonen and Emily Damari, who was released alongside her, into true sisters. 'They were together almost all the time,' says Leshem Gonen. 'I heard the Chief Medical Officer say that those who were held in captivity alongside other hostages returned in better condition — or at least, less deteriorated — compared to those who were alone. As someone observing from the side at times, I can say that Emily and Romi are incredible together.' So you’ve essentially gained another daughter. 'I absolutely feel that way. It’s wonderful. But hey, it’s not just another daughter — it’s also Emily’s siblings. It’s amazing to see how they protect and care for each other. You can also see the deep need that Romi and Emily have to stay connected even now. It’s incredible. They have such a funny dynamic, and they’ve learned to do so many things together that we would never have imagined were possible. My children and Emily’s siblings share a bond that can’t even be put into words because these two girls went through all those days together, alone, with only each other. This is exactly the unity that we, as a nation, need to reach — like our soldiers in battle who don’t ask who is left or right on the political spectrum.' What did Romi know? I first met Merav Leshem Gonen a few days after October 7, at the emerging Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, where she played a major role in an initiative that became a symbol and a pilgrimage site. Those were the days of utter chaos. As expected, her expression was tormented, filled with worry, her face clouded, and it was impossible not to be drawn into the pain she radiated. But even then, she was resolute. 'Romi will come back, that’s not the question. The only question is when,' she kept saying. But from that moment, Leshem Gonen had to endure 471 unbearably long days. She met thousands of people, traveled to the smallest places in Israel and the biggest ones in the world. She never stopped —day after day, through the heavy rains, through the scorching heat of July and August. Merav Leshem Gonen led a remarkable, patient and unwavering campaign for her daughter’s release. She believed all along that the day would come. And when it did, hearts burst with emotion. 'Where’s my mom?' Romi cried out, running toward the loving arms that awaited her at Israel’s border, before leaping into her mother’s embrace — a moment immortalized in an iconic image that encapsulated everything: the struggle, the tears, the highs and lows, the endless waiting. A mother cradling her 24-year-old daughter, whispering: My baby is back. 'We knew that’s how it would be,' says Leshem Gonen. 'It was clear that the first thing she would look for was me, and of course her siblings and her father as well. Romi knew I was waiting for her there, and there was a long discussion with the authorities about it. In previous releases, families were not flown to the border; they were brought to the hospital. My family and I said: That’s not happening. I needed to be there waiting for Romi — just as on October 7, I was the last person she spoke to. The last person to experience the abandonment she felt.' Was that moment of embrace what you imagined? 'I knew for certain that she was coming back alive. Of course, that’s not something to be taken for granted, but deep down I was always sure it would happen. And yet, to actually feel her physically, to hug her, to be so close, to stroke her head — all those little things that seem so obvious to us, we didn’t have them.' Did you plan the 'cradle' photo? 'She just curled up into me, and it was clear to me that I would gather her as much as I could to create a sense of protection. Our name is Leshem Gonen — Gonen means to protect. We protect each other.' The whole country is eager to know what she went through, but there’s also the other side — how do you fill in a year and three months for her? What do you tell her? What do you shield her from? 'It’s extremely complex. On the one hand, we want to give her the full picture. On the other hand, we understand that she is already overwhelmed with so much new information, so we have to go slowly. Just as it will take us a long time to piece together a complete picture of the year and three months she spent in captivity.' 'Maybe we will never truly be able to show her the full picture of what happened here, and maybe she will never be able to give us the full picture of what she went through in Hamas captivity. No doubt — that's the title of a book.' Or even a series, or a movie. 'Absolutely — and there would still be gaps to fill.' What, for example, did she not know? 'For instance, she didn’t hear from her father at all throughout captivity. Her father isn’t a man of many words to begin with, and I’m not exactly talkative either, but something bigger than us happened here. During captivity, she feared something had happened to him. There are many small details she still doesn’t know about us because we’ve been living our reality here, and we assume everyone knows it — but that’s not the case.' 'In captivity, they only saw fragments of information — nothing more. They weren’t heavily exposed to the media, but she did get glimpses of what was happening here. She barely saw us. Her hope was that we remained true to ourselves in the midst of the struggle, that we hadn’t lost our essence as a family, as people. I’m happy to say that when Romi came back, she discovered that her hope had come true.' Don’t say 'cost', talk about 'possible consequences' Although she endured captivity alongside another hostage from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, even Romi Gonen’s family is still unsure how much she truly grasped about what happened in the Gaza border communities on October 7 and the scale of the massacre. 'She was aware of some things, but not everything,' says her mother. 'I still don’t know exactly what she knows. She also didn’t realize how hard we fought for her. She had no idea, for example, why her picture wasn’t displayed as much in public spaces.' Why was that? 'Because it was hard for us. We simply asked that Romi’s picture be displayed in places of unity, places that bring people together. We specifically requested that those who hold up her image do so in spaces of connection. And I must say — I’m not specifying where not to.' So let me suggest — Kaplan Street in Tel Aviv, for instance? 'You know, a stigma has been attached to that place, but there are a lot of good, moral people there. The people of this country knew how to make the distinction themselves, and I find that amazing. They understood on their own where to raise Romi’s picture and where not to. So it’s not about singling out any specific location but rather what people understood from our request.' The country embraced you, surrounded you with love. 'The people. The people embraced us deeply.' You’re making a distinction between the people and the state, I see. 'Absolutely. I make that distinction because I believe that the gap between elected officials and the public has grown wider and wider in recent years. The disconnect between politicians and the people has existed for a long time, even before October 7. The people, however, have closed that gap rather quickly since then.' 'The support we received from the entire nation, from every part of society, from every corner of the country – it was immense. This past May, I started traveling to more and more towns and cities. I visited over 140 communities. I personally met around 30,000 people. And everywhere I went, the first thing people told me was that they wanted all the hostages to come home. That embrace, that care — it was overwhelming. I think that in this way, the politicians learned... along the way. And ultimately, we reached the second hostage release deal.' Meaning? 'This agreement didn’t just happen. The government caught up to the public’s demands. And at the same time, there is an enormous complexity here that I believe must be discussed, remembered, and emphasized. This is a real conversation — we can’t ignore it. There are potential consequences to this deal. But without a deal, there are guaranteed consequences: The hostages will die.' The cost could be heavy. 'I fully understand the cost of the deal, no question. But you know what? Maybe ‘cost’ isn’t the right word in this context. We need to talk about possible consequences. When we define them, we can build strategies to address them. We constantly talk about cost as if it’s a certainty. It’s not, and we need to be cautious here.' But the concern isn’t just about terrorists returning to terror. Some bereaved families are watching the murderers of their loved ones walk free. That’s painful and infuriating. 'You’re right, and that nuance is crucial. I also think it’s unbearable. Our natural and justified desire is to punish those who harmed us. It’s not just a need — it’s about justice and fairness. I want to say to the bereaved families that our hearts are with them. We understand the pain some of them feel. It’s a punch to the heart.' There are claims that efforts are being made to sabotage the hostage deal again. 'There is a responsibility to fully implement the agreement because the state is committed to bringing back all the hostages, just as it is committed to ensuring the safety and security of border communities.' When I hear Keith Siegel’s daughter speak about what he endured, I also feel a desire for revenge. Do you feel that way about what was done to Romi? 'Absolutely. I think we all feel the urge to retaliate. First, because they deserve it — from our perspective. They targeted the most vulnerable among us — children, the elderly, women, partygoers, people who were sleeping. This wasn’t a battle between their tanks and ours. Of course, there’s a desire for revenge. The question is: what serves us as a nation? It’s important to acknowledge that these emotions exist and that the urge for revenge is real. At the same time, the question is whether that feeling should guide us. We need to carefully weigh our options and consider the possible consequences.' On the other hand, maybe there’s no issue of ‘cost’ here at all, because the State of Israel abandoned people to be kidnapped and must be strong enough to handle the consequences of bringing them back. There are no good deals in hell. 'There is one guaranteed outcome if the agreement isn’t carried out: The hostages will be murdered. That’s not a maybe' 'I wouldn’t phrase it that way. What happened to us on October 7 was the result of many factors, if we take a moment to look at it from a broader perspective. One of those factors was our descent into bitter internal conflicts. We were so preoccupied with these fights that we weren’t available to listen to each other’s needs. When you’re arguing with someone, you don’t hear what they need — you focus only on what you want.' And the lesson? 'Now, we need to look at the possible outcomes of a deal to release all the hostages and work to neutralize as many negative consequences as possible. But again, there is one guaranteed outcome if the agreement isn’t carried out: The hostages will be murdered. That’s not a maybe. And in that case, we might not even recover most of their bodies.' Politics? Me? Why? Merav Leshem Gonen’s approach in her fight to free her daughter was highly dignified, noble, even gentle and polite. When asked if this was a deliberate strategy, she responds: 'I think it reflects who I am. Just yesterday, in a conversation with Romi, I reacted to something, and she said, ‘Ugh, Mom, I can’t deal with how much you take everything in stride.’ Now, she didn’t see what I did over these past year and three months, but she knows me. I think that, in general, I sometimes have this need to see the other side. But sometimes, not at all. Sometimes I’m not receptive, sometimes I think my opinion is the absolute truth.' 'Look, once you realize this isn’t a simple situation, you have to listen to others. Maybe they’re right from their perspective? And then you listen and say, ‘Wow, there’s something to what they’re saying, even if it’s not my way.’ We need to be able to hold onto this complexity moving forward because there are such vastly different realities within Israel.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: But when did you tell yourself: This is my way — patient, statesmanlike, restrained? Einav Zangauker took her own approach, which is also well-reasoned but has drawn a lot of criticism. 'I followed my own path fairly early on and received a lot of criticism for being too statesmanlike. People told me I needed to flip tables, to burn roads. I heard these things from others who thought a different approach was the right one, and I respect that because I have no idea what the right way is. But I did understand that there are many ways to express what we believe in. Some people respond to one kind of message, while others respond to something completely different.' 'The support we received from the entire nation, from every part of society, from every corner of the country – it was immense. 'I knew that if I lost myself in the process, then this entire fight wouldn’t be worth anything. Just like if we, as the people of Israel, lose who we are, then everything happening now won’t be worth it. What’s important is to keep fighting together, even if each of us does it in our own way.' At the same time, I barely saw you criticizing others. 'For almost the entire time, I didn’t see the point in commenting on how others chose to act. It’s much more complicated to explain why my way was the right one for me. At some stage, I also realized that if I started attacking political figures — like the prime minister — how exactly would that help me? The precise realization I had was that, at a certain moment, I recognized, or even physically felt, that the right thing to do was to mobilize the people. I understood that, ultimately, the ones driving action are the people and their grassroots leaders. I didn’t focus my efforts primarily on social media, even though we were active there, too. I met with everyone. I visited communities I don’t think many people even know exist. Do you know a place called Kida?' Were there attempts to politically influence your campaign for Romi’s release? Did anyone ever hint that it would be wise not to upset the prime minister or the defense minister since the hostage deal ultimately depended on them? 'Not at all. Only after Romi was released did I hear someone say that because I didn’t criticize the prime minister, she was freed. But that’s simply not true. Romi was released because she was the most severely wounded civilian hostage. She was the only one in captivity with such a serious injury — I’m not referring to those who were murdered, of course. That’s why she was the first to be freed. There’s no other reason.' Will we see you in politics? 'Why does everyone think I’m going into politics?' Because we might benefit if you were in the Knesset. 'Oh, really?' Yes, yes. 'But I’m not suited for politics — It’s a profession in its own right. I’ve never studied it in my life, and I have no interest in politics. But social activism? Absolutely.' In what direction? 'Reaching every corner of the country and figuring out how to build these connections. How to bring different realities closer together. Because the truth is, when you visit a place like Eli, they have their own reality, their daily experiences, their fears — and those fears are real. We need to bring people closer to one another.' Have you already received job offers? 'Not really. But a lot of people told me along the way: ‘When Romi comes back, we’ll reach out to you.’' She still hasn’t adjusted to food Her most important and long-term mission now is to support Romi’s extensive rehabilitation, aimed at restoring function to her right hand and recovering — both physically and mentally — from her prolonged captivity. 'It’s going to be a long rehabilitation process at the hospital, and we will be there every minute she needs us.' Night falls, Romi is asleep. Don’t you feel like checking on her every minute? 'Only at night? I feel like following her all the time. Right now, we’re in a hotel, and there’s a door separating us. My room follows an open-door policy, and hers — whenever Romi wants, she opens it. I’m not sitting around waiting for her all the time, there’s a lot to do, but she knows we’re here. Me, Yardi, her siblings who come by, her father.' What about Romi’s famous favorite bolognese? 'That was the first thing she asked for when she got back, but I haven’t made it yet. I told her that before anything, her stomach needs to get used to food again. She’s not there yet. She’s still eating very little and very carefully, and I just can’t wait for her to enjoy it again.' Has she already encountered people in the streets? 'She hasn’t really been outside in public yet. She had a hospital check-up — we took her in through a back entrance and out through a back entrance. We barely met anyone there. We’re protecting her. Right now, when she walks with me, I’m somehow more recognizable than she is. People don’t recognize her yet. We have to remember that until now, she was just a picture on a poster — people didn’t see her in person. It’s different. Honestly, I also wish people wouldn’t recognize me, but it is what it is.' Eventually, of course, she will return to her life, and everyone — literally everyone — will want to embrace her. 'That’s why I think it’s really important to remind people that not only is Romi a private person, she’s a private person who doesn’t even fully grasp how public she has become. This is her new reality now. Imagine being thrown into a massive crowd, where everyone knows who you are, and each person wants something from you. It’s an incredibly overwhelming, even frightening, feeling.' There will also be questions people might ask her. 'Just as I don’t ask Romi anything, I truly expect the people of Israel not to ask her questions. Just to respect her dignity. After all, that’s why we fought to bring her back — to restore her stolen dignity and freedom. So I am really asking that the people of Israel protect Romi’s freedom and her privacy. This is something we can and must all take part in.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syhwapmy1x	2025-02-15T11:38:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/H1RaJ0xY1g/H1RaJ0xY1g_1_32_630_355_0_small.jpg
The goal is the return of 6 living hostages this week: This is th...	Trump's ultimatum to return 'all the hostages' has passed and Netanyahu is holding consultations; All heads of the defense establishment support the implementation of Phase I of the cease-fire deal, but the deadline and pressure from the right were the source of embarrassment in the Prime Minister's Office; Tonight: Secretary of State Marco Rubio will arrive in Israel and put Trump's plan in focus Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is holding a security consultation on Saturday night, which is being attended by Defense Minister Israel Katz, Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer and representatives of the negotiating team, just as the ultimatum set by U.S. President Donald Trump to Hamas - 'to release all hostages' - has expired. All heads of the defense establishment support the continuation of the implementation of Phase I of the cease-fire and hostage release deal, including the defense minister. He supports this position, under which Israel continues with the original agreement and returns as many living hostages from Gaza as possible. At the same time, the senior officials say that, in the event Hamas violates the agreement, the renewed fighting will be different and much more intense. Discussions are now focusing on an attempt to return the six remaining living hostages slates for Phase I in the coming week, and then attempt to expand the deal to include hostages who are supposed to return in Phase II, by providing additional humanitarian deliveries during Ramadan. The U.S. is also working to return the six from Phase I this week. In addition, the Prime Minister's Office announced Saturday evening that Netanyahu 'will convene the political and security cabinet as soon as possible to decide on Israel's next steps.' The office also stated that 'Prime Minister Netanyahu greatly appreciates President Trump's leadership and the ongoing coordination with the U.S. The combination of the reinforcement of IDF forces around the Gaza Strip and President Trump's aggressive stance led to the release of three of our hostages today - despite Hamas' earlier refusal to release them. The prime minister also appreciates the president's full support for Israel's decisions regarding the Gaza Strip going forward.' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will arrive in Israel Saturday night for a two-day visit to Israel. The visit will focus on talks to continue the hostage deal, in light of Trump's ultimatum , a plan to encourage voluntary immigration of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, the cease-fire in Lebanon, and the Iranian threat. Ahead of his visit, the State Department said that he will deal, among other things, with 'the release of American citizens and all other hostages from Hamas captivity and the promotion of the second phase of the Gaza cease-fire agreement.' Rubio and Netanyahu's meeting will be held on Sunday at noon at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem. Before that, Netanyahu will hold an extended meeting with cabinet ministers. During the day, Rubio will visit the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial and museum with Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, and the two are expected to speak there. Rubio is arriving in Israel from the annual security conference in Munich. On Monday morning, he will conclude his visit and continue with a series of diplomatic meetings in the Middle East. After Israel, his next destination is expected to be Saudi Arabia. The U.S. secretary of state will arrive in Saudi Arabia amid reports that the Saudis and other Arab countries are formulating an alternative to Trump's Gaza plan, which involves a U.S. takeover of Gaza and the removal of the local population. Trump's plan has caused consternation in the Arab world. Ahead of an Arab summit to be held at the end of the month, Rubio said of the plan: 'Right now the only plan - they don't like it, but it's the only plan - is Trump's plan. So if they have a better plan, now is the time to present it.' The ultimatum Trump issued on Monday which called for the release of all the hostages led to a great deal of confusion in the Prime Minister's Office. This could be seen in the Friday statement which announced the names of the three hostages that were released on Saturday. The first statement which published the names of the three hostages stated: 'This list is acceptable to Israel and is being forwarded with the families' approval.' About 20 minutes later, a revised statement was issued reading: 'Instead of 'this list is acceptable to Israel,' it should have stated that 'this list was accepted in Israel.'' The statement added that: 'There was an unfortunate spelling error. This is a purely factual description that does not reflect Israel's attitude toward the issue.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: But a senior source on the negotiating team told Ynet that the amendment by the Prime Minister's Office was intended to reduce the growing pressure on the right on Netanyahu's behavior in recent days. From an explicit threat of a massive war - to agreement (which was denied) with the list of hostages that Hamas handed over. The reactions from the right and the announcement by Otzma Yehudit chairman Itamar Ben-Gvir ('You have the full backing of the president of the world's greatest power to demand all the hostages by Saturday - and you're satisfied with three?!') make it clear that the Prime Minister's Office was under pressure. Two events influenced the PMO's conduct: Hamas' announcement of a freeze on the hostage releases and Trump's ultimatum to Hamas that if all the hostages (with emphasis on 'all') are not released by noon, the gates of hell will open on Gaza. To a large extent, Hamas' unilateral announcement allowed Netanyahu to prove to the right that he is not giving in and that he is seriously threatening to renew the war in Gaza, and even more so with greater intensity. But according to a senior government official, Trump's announcement actually 'complicated' things in Israel without Trump intending to do so at all. The fact that Trump issued an ultimatum to Hamas that Israel did not demand or intend to demand put Netanyahu's office in a bad position. That is why Netanyahu and his people refused to deal with the numbers of hostages or even demand the release of more than three hostages at this time. A senior right-wing source said that Netanyahu came out on the bottom of this incident. Trump set a high bar for the release of all the hostages, while Netanyahu, after all the threats and reports of reservist mobilization and increased security preparedness, ultimately was content with Hamas' list of only three hostages. 'It seems that in the end Israel is coming out of this story looking like a sucker,' says a political source. 'At first, there were voices that agreed with Trump's ultimatum, and in the end, they are content with three hostages. Hamas was already deterred. American pressure worked. Israel failed to leverage this opportunity.' This situation is politically binding on Netanyahu. Netanyahu wants Ben-Gvir to return to the government, but in the meantime he is only flanking Netanyahu on the deep right and claiming that his policy on the deal exudes 'weakness.' Religious Zionist leader Bezalel Smotrich has already smelled the scent of gunpowder in the skies over Gaza, but in the end he too discovered that Israel is returning to dealing with Hamas as it did yesterday or the day before. This is also why the words of Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Chairman Knesset member Yuli Edelstein caused great anger in the Prime Minister's Office. Edelstein claimed during a Knesset meeting that Israel is already engaged in Phase II of the hostage deal - the political significance of which is the dissolution of the government. Therefore, Netanyahu's media advisor Omer Dostri was quick to publish: 'Contrary to Edelstein's claim - Israel is not currently negotiating phase two of the deal.' How will this end? Netanyahu is walking a tightrope. Public sentiment is to continue the hostage deal to the next stage. According to the polls, there is a majority in the public for this. Politically, Netanyahu has lost this round. He is in a big dilemma: how to continue the hostage deal without losing the government and his political survival. These two things do not necessarily go together. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1vn9iat1x	2025-02-15T11:11:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/BJX311o5DYye/BJX311o5DYye_0_28_1280_720_0_small.jpg
Mother and child die from injuries after car ramming attack in Mu...	A 37-year-old woman and her 2-year-old daughter died on Saturday from injuries they sustained when an Afghan national drove a car into a crowd in Munich on Thursday, German police said on Saturday, the first fatalities from the incident. Prosecutors had said on Friday that at least 39 people were injured, some of them critically, when the car ploughed into trade union activists demonstrating for higher pay. Authorities said they were treating the incident as a religiously motivated attack. The attack has brought security issues back into focus in campaigning for Germany's federal election on February 23. The attack also came hours before the arrival of international leaders in the southern German city for the annual Munich Security Conference.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjp6iw0fjl	2025-02-15T10:12:59-08:00

The 'gifts' that Hamas terrorists sent back with released hostage...	Earrings for Sagui Dekel-Chen wife and an hourglass for Einav Zangauker with a photo of her son, Matan, who still remains a hostage; Released hostages begin to describe their captivity; Sasha Troufanov was held alone by Islamic Jihad One of the hostages spent almost 500 days in captivity alone. ​​Sasha Troufanov, who was released from Hamas captivity on Saturday along with Sagui Dekel-Chen and Iair Horn, was held alone without other hostages by the Islamic Jihad terror organization. He suspected that his father, Vitaly, had been murdered in the October 7 massacre. After his release, IDF forces informed him of the death of his father and he immediately burst into tears. Meanwhile, it has been reported that Sagui Dekel-Chen and Iair Horn were held captive together in recent days, alongside other hostages. Yair's mother said that he was in the tunnels, and the two other hostages who were released were also with them. They recently were also held in apartments and even taken outside, seen from the undated video released on Friday by the Palestinians Islamic Jihad of Troufanov walking on the Gaza beach. All three spent the entire period of captivity in Khan Younis, the place from which they were released, located hundreds of meters away from Kibbutz Nir Oz, from where they were kidnapped. The treatment of the hostages at the beginning of the captivity was violent, and they were not spared psychological terror. Hamas terrorists informed Sagui Dekel-Chen that a daughter had been born to him while he was in captivity, and brought earrings for him to give to his wife. He asked upon meeting with the IDF representatives following the handoff from the Red Cross if he truly had a new daughter, because he did not believe them.

The British couple were arrested in Iran for 'security offenses'; Their family says they are 'in distress'; Lindsay wrote before the visit: 'Yes, we're aware of the risks. But we also know the rewards of meeting incredible people, hearing their stories, and seeing the breathtaking landscapes of these regions could far outweigh the fear' Iranian state media reported the arrest of two British citizens in the southern city of Kerman on Thursday. Iran said they were arrested on charges of 'security violations.' State media published a photo of the two, their faces blurred, meeting with the British ambassador. The names of the two detainees were released in Britain on Saturday: Craig and Lindsay Foreman, a couple in their 50s. Their identities were revealed following a statement issued by their family, through the British Foreign Office. The Foreign Office in London said in a statement that the two are in distress, and that the family is in contact with the relevant authorities to ensure they return home safely. 'We are actively engaging with the British government and relevant authorities, working diligently to navigate the complexities of this matter. The family are united in our determination to secure their safe return,' said relatives of the detained couple. Craig and Lindsay were arrested during a motorcycle trip around the world. On December 30, 2024 they crossed the border from Armenia into Iran. Their next stop was supposed to be Pakistan. They arrived in Iran despite the British government warning its citizens against visiting the country.

These things, she believes, 'could far outweigh the fear' involved in visiting Iran. Iran did not elaborate on the 'security offenses' attributed to the Formans. In recent years, Iran has arrested dozens of foreign citizens and dual nationals, often accusing them of espionage and security offenses. These foreigners, mainly Americans and Europeans, are arbitrarily detained, and in exchange for their release, Tehran demands the return of regime supporters imprisoned around the world. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sybvb80y1l	2025-02-15T09:01:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/HyxO00fBRFyx/HyxO00fBRFyx_0_167_1280_720_0_small.jpg
France, allies discuss possible informal Ukraine summit	France is discussing with its allies the possibility of holding an informal meeting among European leaders on Ukraine, although nothing has been decided at this stage, a French presidency official said on Saturday. Speaking on a panel at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said that French President Emmanuel Macron had called for a summit of European leaders in Paris. 'President Trump has a method of operating, which the Russians call reconnaissance through battle. You push and you see what happens, and then you change your position, legitimate tactics. And we need to respond,' Sikorski said. 'And I'm very glad that President Macron has called our leaders to Paris tomorrow, and I expect them to relate to this in a very serious fashion.' The French presidency official said that if there were to be any such summit, it would not be on Sunday. 'I am glad that the (Polish) Prime Minister @donaldtusk will go on Monday at the invitation of the President @EmmanuelMacron to a meeting of European leaders. We need to show our strength and unity,' Sikorski later said on Twitter. It was not clear whether the invite would only be sent to European Union member states or more broadly and whether Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky would be invited.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkzcj8rtkx	2025-02-15T08:32:58-08:00

The Lebanese army fired tear gas on Saturday at Hezbollah supporters protesting around Beirut airport against Lebanon blocking an Iranian flight to Beirut this week after the Israeli military accused Tehran of using civilian aircraft to smuggle cash to Beirut to arm the Lebanese group. Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah called on the army to hold those who fired at the protesters to account. The Lebanese army and government 'should have held immediate meetings to prevent the Israeli enemy from imposing its dictates on the airport and from continuing its occupation of Lebanese territory ... instead of using force against a peaceful sit-in on the airport road,' Fadlallah added in a statement. Iran barred Lebanese planes from repatriating dozens of Lebanese nationals stranded in Iran on Friday, in a standoff between the two countries following what Tehran described as an Israeli threat to attack it.

Freed hostage Sasha Troufanov reunites with family after 498 days...	Troufanov reunited with mother Elena and partner Sapir Cohen in emotional embrace; 29-year-old abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7; his father was murdered, and his mother, grandmother and partner were released in 2023 Nearly 500 days after being abducted by Hamas, Sasha Troufanov reunited Saturday with his mother Elena and partner Sapir Cohen in an emotional embrace after his release from captivity in Gaza. 'I’m okay,' he reassured them upon their first hug. Troufanov, 29, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7 along with Cohen, his mother and grandmother Irena Tati. His father, Vitaliy, was murdered in the attack. Elena and Irena, both Russian citizens, were released in November 2023 as part of an earlier hostage deal, while Troufanov remained in captivity for nearly 500 days. In November, when Elena and Irena were handed over to the Red Cross in Khan Younis, they were surrounded by a jeering crowd. Footage from the release showed Irena smiling as she met a Red Cross representative. The two women were later transferred to Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv, where they were reunited with family and friends. Following her release, Elena provided a rare sign of life from captivity when she appeared in a Hamas video alongside freed hostages Daniela Aloni and Rimon Buchstab-Kirsht. On October 7, Cohen and Troufanov had traveled to Nir Oz to visit his family. Cohen later recalled that he had an inexplicable feeling of dread. 'Sasha didn’t want to go. He told me, ‘I don’t know why, but I feel like I want to cancel.’ I convinced him, and we went,' she said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: That morning, they awoke to a rocket barrage with no bomb shelter to take cover. 'We got a message about a terrorist infiltration. We didn’t even know what that meant,' Cohen said. They hid under the bed, clinging to one another as they heard Hamas terrorists storming homes, executing residents and setting houses ablaze. 'I just kept repeating my prayer over and over,' she recalled in an interview with Ynet. 'The fear was unbearable. My whole body was shaking, I was sweating. I kept thinking, God, how is this how my life ends? I haven’t even done anything meaningful yet. Then, when they pulled me out, I saw Sasha on his knees, his face covered in blood. I thought that was the end.' The couple was separated, and Cohen was forced onto a motorcycle and taken into Gaza. 'As we drove, people in the streets came to hit me, to touch me,' she said. After an hours-long trek—barefoot over nails and debris—she was forced into Hamas’ underground tunnel network, where she remained in total darkness. 'There’s no light at all,' she described. 'Sometimes a terrorist would turn on a flashlight, and still, I couldn’t see anything. The air was so thick it felt like I couldn’t breathe.' Humidity made conditions unbearable. 'The mattresses were soaked with moisture and covered in mold. The stench was overwhelming. You couldn’t sleep.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjw00vrcyyg	2025-02-15T07:59:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/r1mxJrRtJg/r1mxJrRtJg_1_132_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Saudi Arabia spearheads Arab scramble for alternative to Trump's ...	Arab world furious about Trump's plan to 'clean out' Gaza; Arab nations to meet in Riyadh to discuss alternative Gaza plans; Egyptian proposal currently most likely candidate; Saudi crown prince expected to play key role in discussions Saudi Arabia is spearheading urgent Arab efforts to develop a plan for Gaza's future as a counter to U.S. President Donald Trump's ambition for a Middle East Riviera cleared of its Palestinian inhabitants, 10 sources said. Draft ideas will be discussed at a meeting in Riyadh this month of countries including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. Proposals may involve a Gulf-led reconstruction fund and a deal to sideline Hamas, five of the people said. Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies were aghast at Trump's plan to 'clean out' Palestinians from Gaza and resettle most of them in Jordan and Egypt, an idea immediately rejected by Cairo and Amman and seen in most of the region as deeply destabilizing. The dismay in Saudi Arabia was aggravated, sources said, because the plan would nix the kingdom's demand for a clear path to Palestinian statehood as a condition to normalize ties with Israel - something that would also pave the way for an ambitious military pact between Riyadh and Washington, shoring up the kingdom's defenses against Iran. Reuters spoke to 15 sources in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and elsewhere to build a picture of the hurried efforts by Arab states to pull together existing proposals into a new plan they can sell to the U.S. president - even potentially calling it a 'Trump plan' to win his approval. All the sources declined to be identified because the issue involves international or domestic sensitivities and they were not authorized to speak in public. One Arab government source said at least four proposals had already been drafted for Gaza's future, but an Egyptian proposal was now emerging as central to the Arab push for an alternative to Trump's idea. The Egyptian proposal The latest Egyptian proposal involves forming a national Palestinian committee to govern Gaza without Hamas involvement, international participation in reconstruction without displacing Palestinians abroad, and movement towards a two-state solution, three Egyptian security sources said. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Palestinian representatives will review and discuss the plan in Riyadh before it is presented at a scheduled Arab summit on February 27, the Arab government source said. The role of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, widely known as MbS, is shaping up to be key. 'We are telling the Americans we have a plan that works. Our meeting with MbS is going to be critical. He is taking the lead,' said a Jordanian official. The crown prince had a warm relationship with the first Trump administration and is increasingly central to Arab ties with the United States during the new Trump era. Long a major regional partner of the United States, the crown prince is expanding Saudi Arabia's relationship through business and global power politics. Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund is holding a conference in Miami this month that Reuters revealed Trump is expected to attend. Riyadh is also expected to host his coming talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to try to end the Ukraine war. The White House did not respond to several requests for comment on this story. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking on Thursday, referred to the coming Arab meeting, saying: 'Right now the only plan - they don't like it - but the only plan is the Trump plan. So if they've got a better plan, now's the time to present it.' Spokespeople for Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE and Israel did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Buffer zone Clear plans for Gaza's post-war future have already proven hard to develop as they require positions on contentious debates regarding the territory's internal governance, security management, funding and reconstruction. Israel has already rejected any role for Hamas or the Palestinian Authority in governing Gaza, or ensuring security there. Arab countries and the United States have also said they do not want to put troops on the ground to do that. Gulf states, which have historically paid for reconstruction in Gaza, have said they do not want to do so this time without guarantees that Israel will not again destroy what they build. Jordan's King Abdullah emphasized to Trump on Monday at their meeting in the White House that he was working with Saudi Arabia and Egypt on a Gaza plan that would work, a Jordanian official said. Abdullah said in televised comments after the meeting that the countries would review an Egyptian plan and 'we will be in Saudi Arabia to discuss how we can work with the president and the United States.' Reuters could not immediately reach Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi for comment. After Abdullah's meeting with Trump, Safadi said: 'We are now working on crystallizing the Arab plan.' Initial proposals shared by the three Egyptian security sources relating to reconstruction and financing appear advanced. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: A buffer zone and physical barrier would be erected to stop tunnels being built across Gaza's border with Egypt. As soon as the rubble is removed, 20 areas will be established as temporary living zones. Around 50 Egyptian and other foreign companies would be brought in to carry out the work. Financing would involve international and Gulf money, said a regional source with knowledge of the matter. A potential fund could be named the Trump Fund for Reconstruction, the Arab government official said. However, the most difficult issues around Gaza's governance and internal security remain to be decided, the official said. Forcing Hamas out of any role in Gaza would be critical, said the Arab official and the three Egyptian sources. Hamas has previously said it is willing to cede government in Gaza to a national committee, but it would want a role in choosing its members and would not accept the deployment of any ground forces without its consent. The three Egyptian sources said that while nothing in the plan was very new, they believed it was good enough to change Trump's mind and that it could be imposed on Hamas and the Palestinian Authority under Mahmoud Abbas. 'Not pleased' Saudi annoyance over Gaza had already been building before Trump's announcement. The kingdom had repeatedly said normalization with Israel was conditional on a path to creating a Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem. That stance hardened as Saudi public anger grew at the destruction and death in Gaza. In November, the crown prince publicly accused Israel of genocide during an Islamic summit and doubled down on the need for a two-state solution. Frustration was running high in the kingdom over the ongoing war, two regional intelligence sources said. Washington appeared ready to push past Riyadh's demand for two states. The day before his Gaza announcement, Trump was asked whether a normalization deal could go ahead without a two-state solution. He said: 'Saudi Arabia is going to be very helpful.' Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had held meetings in Riyadh in late January. Two senior diplomats said Witkoff laid out a three-month timeline for the normalization process. But Saudi frustration quickly turned into surprise and then anger when Trump announced his Gaza idea. 'He is not pleased,' a source close to the Saudi royal court said of Prince Mohammed's reaction. The level of anger was quickly evident in state media broadcasts - which analysts say are often a measure of official Saudi viewpoints - with television news reports personally excoriating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'They are outraged,' said Aziz Alghashian, a Saudi analyst familiar with official thinking, describing the mood among senior Saudi officials. 'This is outrageous. More than frustration, this is on another level.' Many experts say Trump may be using an old bargaining ploy from his diplomatic playbook, setting out an extreme position as an opening gambit for negotiations. During his first term, he often issued what were widely seen as over-the-top foreign policy pronouncements, many of which never came to fruition. Still, it has complicated the normalization talks. Former Saudi intelligence head Prince Turki al-Faisal, who holds no current role in the government, said in a CNN interview last week that if Trump visited Riyadh, 'I'm sure he will get an earful from the leadership here.' Asked if he could see any prospect of normalization talks advancing with Israel, he said: 'Not at all.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byrk11bck1l	2025-02-15T07:38:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/SyI6mN0KJg/SyI6mN0KJg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Waiting for dad: The fathers still held captive by Hamas	While Sagui Dekel-Chen reunited with his daughters, many children are still waiting for their fathers; Tal Shoham, Tsachi Idan and Ohad Yahalomi are set for release, while David Cunio, Elkana Bochbot and Omri Miran remain in captivity; many fathers' remains are also still held in Gaza After 498 days in Hamas captivity, Sagui Dekel-Chen was reunited with his daughters Bari, Gali and newborn Shahar-Mazal, whom he had never met. But dozens of other fathers remain in Gaza, nearly 500 days after they were abducted, with some expected to be released in the remaining phases of the current hostage deal. Tal Shoham: Father of Neveh and Yahel Tal Shoham, 39, from Ma’aleh Tzvi, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7, along with his wife, Adi, their children, Neveh, 8, and Yahel, 4, his mother-in-law, and two other family members. While his entire family was freed after 50 days in captivity, Tal remains in Gaza. He is on the release list for the ongoing hostage deal, with two more exchange rounds still pending. In June 2024, Adi shared a heartbreaking 'question sheet' written by their children after their return from captivity. 'These are just fragments of our daily life. This has been our reality for far too long. We must bring Tal home to his grieving children—this is the most urgent, humane and just action to take,' she wrote. Their questions ranged from when their father would return to why they kept seeing other fathers reunite with their families while theirs was still missing. They also continued to process the horrors they witnessed, asking questions like: 'Why was that man outside shouting? Is it happening again like in Be’eri? Why did they come into the kibbutz and do this? How did they kill Grandpa? Did he see it coming, or was he surprised? Mom, are we about to die?' David Cunio: Father of Yuli and Emma David Cunio, 33, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, was kidnapped with his wife, Sharon Aloni-Cunio, and their three-year-old twin daughters, Yuli and Emma. On October 7, he held the door of their shelter shut for five hours as terrorists tried to break in. Sharon and the girls were freed after 52 days, but David remains in captivity. His brother, Ariel Cunio, was also abducted with his partner Arbel Yehoud, who was released in the current hostage exchange after being held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. While David remains in Gaza, his daughters celebrated their fourth birthday without him, blowing out candles and making a single wish: that their father returns home. Sharon recently released a video in Arabic, pleading with Hamas for proof of life. 'David and I marked our anniversary while he was in captivity. We’ve been together for almost 11 years. He is the love of my life, and I cannot imagine a future without him,' she said. Tsachi Idan: Father of Ma’ayan, Sharon, Yael and Shahar Tsachi Idan was kidnapped from his home in Nahal Oz, after terrorists stormed in and murdered his eldest daughter Ma’ayan. His house became a makeshift command center for the attackers, who rounded up other families from the kibbutz before taking Tsachi and fellow hostages Omri Miran, Judith and Natalie Raanan into Gaza. The Raanans were later released, but Tsachi remains in captivity. A devoted soccer fan and Hapoel Tel Aviv supporter, Tsachi has been married to Gali for 18 years, and the couple has four children: Ma’ayan, who was murdered on October 7; Sharon, 15.5, who was in Tel Aviv with relatives at the time of the attack and Yael, 12, and Shahar, 10, who were home when the attack happened.

Would he approve of the new pergola we built outside the caravan? I try to take his place, but I refuse to do so permanently. I miss my partner in life. The little things—listening to music at night, sharing a drink—are gone. There is now a gaping hole where he used to be.' Omri Miran: Father of Alma and Roni Omri Miran was kidnapped in front of his wife, Lishay, and their two daughters, Roni, 2, and Alma, 1. Terrorists stormed their home, forcing Omri, his wife and their daughters into the house of their neighbors, the Idan family. The attackers then separated the men from the women and children, dragging Omri into captivity while his daughter Roni ran after him, crying, 'Dad, Dad!' In April 2024, Hamas released a hostage video featuring Omri alongside Keith Siegel, another captive who was released last week. Lishay said her younger daughter Alma knows her father only from posters, photos and stories her older sister tells. Now relocated to Kibbutz Kerem Shalom, Lishay waits for news on Omri’s fate. 'Roni remembers more details every night. She saw her father tied up. She woke up to guns pointed at her face. She screams in her sleep, 'Good night, Dad!' I just want her to stop screaming. I want him here. I want to scream for the hostages—don’t forget us.' Ohad Yahalomi: Father of Eitan, Yael and their younger sister The Yahalomi family was kidnapped together. Bat-Sheva and her two young daughters were taken on one motorcycle, while her son Eitan was taken separately. Ohad, their father, was left behind injured, only to be abducted later. At the Gaza border, the terrorist driving Bat-Sheva and the girls panicked and fell, allowing her and the girls to escape. Eitan, however, was taken into captivity with his father. After 52 days in Gaza, Eitan was released—but Ohad remains missing. A nature reserve inspector, Ohad's whereabouts remain unknown. 'We have no news about him,' said Bat-Sheva. 'The uncertainty is unbearable. I don’t want to imagine what this time is doing to the hostages. Every day is another weight of despair on their shoulders. I don’t know how they survive this.' Elkana Bohbot: Father of Re'em David Elkana Bohbot, a production worker at the Nova music festival, had the chance to flee but chose to stay behind and help the wounded. He was last seen assisting in the evacuation of injured civilians before being kidnapped. His wife, Rivka, and their four-year-old son, Re’em David, continue to wait for his return. 'He could have run, but he decided to stay and help,' Rivka said in a speech to Knesset. 'At 8:00 a.m., we spoke for the last time. He promised he would come home. I believe him. We have a son who waits for him every day.' While some fathers remain alive in captivity, the remains of others are still being held by Hamas. Among them: Ronen Engel, Aviv Atzili, Meny Godard, Ilan Weiss, Col. Asaf Hamami, Tal Chaimi, Yair (Yaya) Yaakov, Eitan Levi, Eliyahu 'Churchill' Margalit, Shlomo Mansour, Lior Rudaeff, Amiram Cooper and Yossi Sharabi. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjru8eaf1e	2025-02-15T07:26:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/rkKshy0Fke/rkKshy0Fke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

US president says 'Israel will now have to decide what they will do' about US deadline for release of all hostages U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday welcomed the release of Israeli-American Sagui Dekel-Chen, Iair Horn and Israeli-Russian Alexander 'Sasha' Troufanov from Hamas captivity, noting that unlike previous releases, the freed hostages appeared to be in 'good shape.' In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said that the U.S. had set a deadline for the release of all hostages by 12:00 p.m. He added, 'Israel will now have to decide what they will do about the 12:00 O’CLOCK, TODAY, DEADLINE imposed on the release of ALL HOSTAGES. The United States will back the decision they make!' Trump did not specify a time zone, but his post was published after 12:00 p.m. Israeli time, suggesting he was referring to Eastern U.S. time (7:00 p.m. in Israel). Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was set to hold a security consultation at 7:00 p.m. local time on the next phase of negotiations, according to his office. The meeting, attended by Defense Minister Israel Katz, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and senior members of Israel's negotiating team, would discuss the possibility of expanding the deal. Trump also pointed out that Hamas’ decision to release the hostages contradicted earlier claims by the terrorist group. Last week, Hamas announced it would halt hostage releases, accusing Israel of violating the agreement, only to reverse its stance after further negotiations.

The Prime Minister’s Office also reaffirmed full coordination with Washington. 'We are working in full coordination with the United States to recover all of our hostages—both living and deceased—as quickly as possible, and we are fully prepared for what comes next, in every possible aspect,' the statement read The office added that the freed hostages were being welcomed 'with open arms,' and that Israel, alongside their families, would support their rehabilitation after their prolonged and grueling captivity. Meanwhile, Hamas politburo member Basem Naim said that the terrorist group seeks to see the deal implemented in full and called for further negotiations. 'Israel has not yet opened negotiations on the second phase of the cease-fire agreement.

Freed Palestinian prisoners wear Star of David shirts	Israel Prisons Service changes release attire of freed Palestinian prisoners including Jewish symbols and Arabic phrase in warning The Israel Prison Service (IPS) changed the release attire of Palestinian prisoners freed in Saturday's hostage-prisoner exchange, dressing them in tracksuits emblazoned with a Star of David, the IPS logo, and the phrase 'We will not forget, we will not forgive', Israeli officials said. In previous prisoner releases, Palestinian inmates were given bracelets with the IPS logo and shown videos of destruction in Gaza before their departure. As in previous exchanges, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners were released from Israeli prisons in exchange for the return of hostages Sagui Dekel-Chen, Iair Horn and Alexander 'Sasha' Trupanov. Palestinian media broadcast footage of celebrations in the West Bank’s Ramallah following the release of prisoners.

Sagui, Sasha and Iair reunite with families in Israel	After 498 days in Hamas captivity, Sagui meets his wife and learns his newborn daughter’s name, while Sasha informed of his father’s death in October 7 attack; hostages taken to hospitals for medical evaluation Sagui Dekel-Chen, Iair Horn and Alexander 'Sasha' Trupanov arrived in Israel on Saturday after 498 days in Hamas captivity, with the IDF confirming they were transferred to hospitals for medical evaluation following their release as part of the hostage-prisoner exchange. The three men, kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the October 7 attack, were first brought to a military reception center in Re’im, near the Gaza border, where they underwent initial health assessments before being airlifted to Sheba and Sourasky hospitals. 'IDF personnel from the Medical Corps and Manpower Directorate are accompanying the freed hostages, providing medical evaluations and support,' the IDF said in a statement. Military representatives also remained in close contact with their families, who were waiting for updates at the hospitals. Horn’s family, overjoyed but still anxious, said they could 'finally breathe' after more than a year of uncertainty. 'Iair is home after surviving hell in Gaza. Now, we need to bring back Eitan, so our family can truly breathe again,' they said, referring to his younger brother who remains in Hamas captivity. As he arrived in Israel, Horn, a devoted fan of the Hapoel Be’er Sheva soccer team, was gifted a team jersey and requested to fly over the club's Turner Stadium in the southern city. Meanwhile, Dekel-Chen met his wife Avital and parents at the Re’im reception center for the first time since his abduction, learning that he had become a father for the third time during his captivity. His daughter, Shahar, was born four months after he was kidnapped, and he had never met her. Avital revealed their daughter’s name to him, explaining that she had followed through with a name he had chosen before his kidnapping. 'Do you remember what you wanted to name her? That’s her name—Shahar Mazal,' Avital told him. 'Perfect. What a name,' Dekel-Chen responded, moved by the moment. On his way to the hospital, Dekel-Chen sent a heartfelt message to his daughters: 'Bari, Gali, Shahar—thank you for watching over me. Dad is on his way.' His wife Avital, overwhelmed with relief, expressed gratitude to everyone who supported her throughout the ordeal. 'I have been waiting so long for Sagui, and I am so proud of him for holding on through this nightmare,' she told Israeli media. 'We are about to begin a new chapter together.' She recalled how one of their daughters had told her with confidence: 'I told you Dad would come home.' For Trupanov, the joy of freedom was shadowed by devastating news. On his way back to Israel, he was informed that his father, Vitaliy Trupanov, had been murdered by Hamas during the October 7 attack. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Trupanov’s family, anxiously awaiting his return, had no idea whether he knew about his father’s fate before crossing into Israel. 'This revelation will turn what should be a day of joy into a day of deep mourning,' they said. 'On October 7, Sasha was violently kidnapped from his home and shot in both legs,' his family said in a statement. 'Seeing him today gives us immense strength and hope for his long road to recovery. This is a moment of immense relief for us, his friends, and everyone who never stopped hoping and praying for his return.' Defense Minister Israel Katz welcomed the freed hostages back, vowing to continue efforts to secure the release of all captives still held in Gaza. 'Iair, Sasha, Sagui—welcome home. The entire nation embraces you and celebrates your reunion with your families,' Katz said. 'The IDF remains fully deployed and prepared for any scenario, ensuring Hamas cannot violate the deal or obstruct future hostage releases.' He also thanked U.S. President Donald Trump for his firm support of Israel, saying: 'We will continue working with him to ensure that all hostages return home as soon as possible, and that the Palestinian terror threat is crushed and eradicated from Gaza.' So far, 19 hostages have been freed as part of the latest exchange, while 14 more remain on the list for the first phase of the agreement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sywrogrkjg	2025-02-15T02:52:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/ryJdigAtye/ryJdigAtye_0_0_1279_720_0_small.jpg

Following the release of Alexnader Trupanov, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Yair Horn, Prime Minister's Office condemns terrorist group's attempts to derail deal Following the release of hostages Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn, and Alexander 'Sasha' Trupanov on Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement, 'Hamas once again attempted to violate the agreement and create a false crisis. Thanks to our forces inside and around Gaza and U.S. President Donald Trump’s clear and unequivocal statement, Hamas backed down and the hostage release continued.' The statement stressed full coordination with the U.S. to secure the return of all hostages, both living and deceased, 'as quickly as possible' and added, 'We welcome them with open arms. We have prepared for their return and, together with their families, will support their rehabilitation after their long and harrowing captivity.' 'Israel has yet to open negotiations on the second phase of the cease-fire agreement. We seek to implement the deal in full,' Hamas politburo member Basem Naim said. Netanyahu has remained vague regarding Israel’s stance on the deal, which includes the release of 369 Palestinian prisoners. Pressure from his far-right coalition partners led his office to issue contradictory and unclear statements throughout the week. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On Friday, the Prime Minister’s Office was forced to correct a statement regarding Israel’s acceptance of the list of hostages slated for release, changing 'accepted by Israel' to 'received by Israel' 20 minutes later, clarifying that it was 'a factual description, not a policy statement.' President Isaac Herzog also addressed the release, condemning Hamas’s 'cruel spectacle' and calling for the deal’s completion: 'Sagui has yet to meet his daughter, born after his abduction; Sasha's father was murdered, and his mother, grandmother and partner were kidnapped and later released; Yair returns while his brother Eitan remains captive. These are not horror movie scripts — this is the reality of innocent civilians abducted by terrorists and freed today after 498 days in the depths of hell. 'Sagui, Sasha, Yair — we waited so long for you! After the cynical and repulsive show you were forced to endure, we are relieved that you are on your way to reunite with your families. Completing the hostage deal is a moral, humane and Jewish imperative. We will continue doing everything in our power to bring home all our brothers and sisters still held in Gaza — until the last one is returned.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjn9wyryjg	2025-02-15T01:25:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/H1FPqcwF1e/H1FPqcwF1e_0_90_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Abbas slams ‘delusional’ Trump over Gaza displacement plan	Palestinian Authority chairman calls Trump plan 'attempt to erase the Palestinian cause,' warns of Israeli 'war crimes' and accuses settler groups of undermining the two-state solution Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday rejected any attempt to impose a new U.S.-backed peace proposal, warning that efforts to forcibly remove Palestinians from their land were 'delusional.' 'Anyone who believes they can impose a new 'Deal of the Century,' displace our people and seize every inch of our land is delusional,' Abbas said in a speech at the African Union Summit in Ethiopia. His remarks were seen as a direct rebuke of U.S. President Donald Trump, who in his previous term attempted to advance a peace plan involving territorial swaps and Israeli sovereignty over parts of the West Bank. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The comments also follow Trump’s recent statements about his intent to relocate Gaza’s population, a move Abbas claimed was designed to erase the Palestinian cause and divert global attention from what he described as 'war crimes, genocide, settlement expansion, land theft and attacks on holy sites in the West Bank and Jerusalem.' Abbas accused Israel and settler groups of systematically undermining the two-state solution, saying, 'These actions are carried out by the occupation forces and settler terrorist gangs, with the aim of dismantling the Palestinian Authority and burying the two-state solution.' Abbas’ remarks come just days after he issued a presidential decree repealing Palestinian laws that had authorized payments to families of prisoners held in Israeli jails and to relatives of terrorists killed in attacks. The move was viewed as a signal to Washington, but it quickly drew condemnation from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, who accused the PA of capitulating to U.S. and Israeli pressure. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjpdy1cf1x	2025-02-15T01:22:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2017/09/20/8048675/8048675_0_0_1300_732_0_small.jpg

Trupanov, 29, from Tel Aviv, was kidnapped while visiting his father, mother Yelena and grandmother Irena Tati with his girlfriend Sapir Cohen at Kibbutz Nir Oz. His father was among the over 1,200 people killed when Hamas launched its coordinated assault on southern Israel. His mother, grandmother and girlfriend were released in the November 2023 hostage exchange, but Sasha remained in captivity under Palestinian Islamic Jihad. His release on Saturday came after 498 days in Gaza as part of the sixth phase of the hostage-prisoner exchange deal. Trupanov was previously featured in multiple propaganda videos released by his captors, in which he spoke under apparent duress about poor conditions in captivity. After his release, he was transferred to IDF forces inside Gaza before crossing into Israel, where he is expected to undergo medical evaluations and reunite with his family—now learning the devastating news of his father’s fate. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy06dc6k1g	2025-02-15T00:12:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/S10BwRTK1x/S10BwRTK1x_0_78_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

The three men, held captive for 498 days after being kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7, were first transferred to Red Cross custody before being escorted to an IDF meeting point inside Gaza. They will undergo initial medical assessments after returning to Israeli soil. Their release follows a highly choreographed handover by Hamas in Khan Younis, where the group staged a propaganda event, parading the hostages on a platform adorned with banners in broken Hebrew.

Report: Hamas will 'consider' releasing hostage Maxim Herkin at R...	Russian news agency notes terror group is mulling Herkin's release in the deal's first phase but doesn't provide details; Hamas official tells Moscow release hangs on deal's second phase Hamas said it would 'consider' Russia's request to release hostage Maxim Herkin, whose daughter and mother hold Russian citizenship, Russian news agency TASS reported Friday. No further details were provided. Earlier this month, senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk visited Moscow and said Herkin's release would be decided in the negotiations of the deal’s second phase with Israel. He added Hamas was willing to prioritize him, after previously promising that Sasha Trupanov would be freed soon. A week earlier, Israeli Ambassador to Moscow Simona Halperin revealed that Israel and Russia were working together to secure the release of three hostages held in Gaza who are not included in the first phase of the deal and do not hold Russian citizenship. In an interview with Russian news outlet RBC, she identified one of them as 36-year-old Maxim Herkin, originally from Donbas and living in Tirat Carmel. While he is not a Russian citizen, his daughter was born and resides in Russia and his mother received Russian citizenship after his abduction. The names of the other two hostages were not disclosed. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We truly hope the Russians can help. I sincerely believe that Russia could facilitate the release of these three hostages if it demands it persistently enough,' Halperin said. Russia's diplomatic efforts began in March 2024, according to Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov, President Vladimir Putin’s envoy to the Middle East and Africa. In June, reports said that 'Hamas leadership promised Russia it would release two Russian citizens still held in Gaza, but this requires a cease-fire' to allow their transfer to the Red Cross. 'As early as March, we actively raised these issues with Hamas to release Russian citizens without an agreement,' Bogdanov said. Activist Alex Tenzer suggested Hamas might make a 'gesture' toward Russia and release 34 hostages in the deal’s first phase, including Herkin, adding that failing to release the two Russian citizens would be a slap in the face to Moscow. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjzn4pafke	2025-02-14T23:02:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/17/B1vix112116/B1vix112116_1_34_400_225_0_small.jpg

Hamas terrorists arrived at the hostage release site in Khan Younis on Saturday morning wearing stolen IDF uniforms and military vests, while carrying Israeli weapons seized during the October 7 attack, according to footage in Arab media. The three Israeli hostages—Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn and Alexander 'Sasha' Trupanov—were reportedly transported to the release point in a vehicle also stolen by Hamas during the October 7 massacre. The highly choreographed handover is part of a wider propaganda display by Hamas, aimed at reinforcing its psychological warfare tactics against Israel. This release marks the sixth phase of the ongoing hostage deal, with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad jointly freeing captives for the first time. In exchange, Israel is set to release 369 Palestinian prisoners.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sycqxapfkx	2025-02-14T22:34:41-08:00	
Hamas stages propaganda event as 3 hostages released in Gaza	Terror group to release hostages in propaganda-filled handover in Khan Younis, featuring stolen IDF uniforms, weapons and banners in broken Hebrew; hourglass with Israeli hostage’s image displayed, as Hamas warns Israel to uphold cease-fire deal The sixth round of the hostage release deal is underway, with Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn and Alexander 'Sasha' Trupanov set to be handed over by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) on Saturday. As in previous exchanges, Hamas used the event for a highly staged propaganda display, reinforcing the brutality of Gaza’s terrorist factions. This marks the first time that both Hamas and PIJ have jointly released hostages. In previous exchanges, PIJ conducted its own separate handovers, including the recent release of Gadi Mozes and Arbel Yehoud, during which the two hostages were placed in serious danger from an angry crowd surrounding them. At the release point in Khan Younis, Hamas erected large banners in broken Hebrew, and the stage was decorated with images of the Al-Aqsa Mosque alongside Hamas propaganda footage showing attacks on Israeli communities on October 7 and clashes with Israeli forces. One sign referenced former U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to evacuate Gazans, reading: 'No migration except to Jerusalem.' Adding to the spectacle, Hamas terrorists arrived dressed in stolen IDF uniforms and vests, carrying Israeli weapons, and according to reports, the hostages were transported to the release point in a vehicle stolen during the October 7 attack. As part of its propaganda drive, Hamas placed an hourglass on the stage featuring images of hostage Matan Zangauker and his mother Einav, one of the most prominent advocates for the release of the captives, with the caption: 'Time is running out.' Reports suggest that Hamas intended to hand the hourglass to one of the released hostages to deliver to Zangauker’s family. Additionally, Hamas reportedly gave Sagui Dekel-Chen a 'gift' in reference to the birth of his daughter, Shahar, whom he has never met. Shahar was born four months after Dekel-Chen’s abduction on October 7.

Flags of Arab nations opposing the displacement of Gazans were displayed as a symbolic gesture. A Hamas spokesperson claimed on Saturday that the group was 'waiting for Israel to implement the humanitarian protocol' agreed upon with mediators before proceeding with further releases. 'The release of the hostages in this phase was confirmed only after we received guarantees that Israel would uphold the agreement,' the spokesperson said. He warned that Israel 'has no alternative to releasing all hostages other than implementing all clauses of the cease-fire agreement.' The release is part of an ongoing deal negotiated with international mediators, under which Israel is expected to free 369 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the return of three Israeli hostages. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkmcrnpk1e	2025-02-14T22:21:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/S1ejsC2aYkl/S1ejsC2aYkl_0_241_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Terrorists with blood on their hands: 36 convicted killers among ...	Israel readies to free 369 prisoners in exchange for release of hostages Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn and Sasha Trupanov as part of deal As part of the ongoing hostage release deal with Hamas, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners are set to be freed from Israeli jails on Saturday in exchange for the release of hostages Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn and Sasha Trupanov. According to Hamas' Media Office for Prisoners, 369 prisoners will be released — 36 serving life sentences and 333 Gazans who were arrested after October 7. This is the largest batch of Gazan prisoners released in the first phase of the deal so far. One of the prisoners reportedly set for release is Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in the Jabaliya refugee camp. He was arrested in December 2024 on suspicion of working for Hamas during an IDF raid on the facility. Also on the list is Ahmed Barghouti, an aide to terrorist Marwan Barghouti, who was Fatah’s secretary-general in the West Bank. He was arrested on April 15, 2002, and Hamas reportedly demanded his release as part of the deal. Marwan Barghouti orchestrated attacks that killed five Israelis and injured many others. In 2004, he was sentenced to five life terms and an additional 40 years. Israel has denied he will be freed. Another prisoner set for release is Mohammed Shra’iya, a Palestinian Authority intelligence officer from Bethlehem, who shot and murdered Superintendent Moshe Dayan on March 2, 2002, while Dayan was riding a motorcycle in the Judean Desert. Dayan, 46, left behind a wife and three children. Shra’iya, originally from Za’atra, was arrested two months later by the Shin Bet after being wounded in a clash between Israeli forces and wanted terrorists holed up in a Bethlehem church. He later admitted to carrying out the attack, saying he targeted Israeli hikers. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another terrorist expected to be released is Mansour Muqada, who murdered Dr. Mordechai Shafir on February 26, 2001. Shafir, a 56-year-old Kfar Saba resident, was found dead in his orchard, and his death was mistakenly believed to be an accident for over a year and a half. In August 2002, IDF forces arrested Muqada, a resident of Zawiya, who admitted to the murder, saying he set out to kill Jews 'as revenge for Intifada casualties,' referring to the mass uprising of Palestinians against Israel in the early 2000s. He was also linked to other attacks in the West Bank. In February 2003, a Tel Aviv court sentenced him to life with an additional four years. Another terrorist slated for release is Samir Aite, who participated in the murder of Moran Amit in 2002 in Jerusalem. He was part of a seven-man terror cell he had formed. Aite, 19 at the time, worked as a janitor at an East Jerusalem school where other cell members studied. According his the indictment, he founded the terror cell to carry out attacks against Jews. Amit, 25, from Kibbutz Kfar Hanassi, was a law student at the University of Haifa and managed an online singles forum. She was hiking with a friend in the forest when masked terrorists ambushed them. The two fled, but Amit tripped. The terrorists caught her, stabbed her repeatedly and fled. She was rushed to the hospital where she succumbed to her wounds. In January 2003, a Jerusalem court sentenced Aite to life plus 20 years. He was also convicted of prior attempts to carry out attacks in Jerusalem, including a stabbing. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byksmnaykx	2025-02-14T21:58:57-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/18/ByK8c300Pyg/ByK8c300Pyg_0_0_794_443_0_small.jpg
Red Cross en route to collect 3 hostages for release in Khan Youn...	The Red Cross is currently making its way to the designated pickup point in Khan Younis to collect the three Israeli hostages set for release, an Israeli security source said Saturday. According to intelligence received by Israeli authorities, the transfer process is now underway, marking a critical moment in the latest phase of the hostage release deal. The three hostages—Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, Yair Horn, 46, and Alexander 'Sasha' Trupanov, 29—were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the October 7 attack and have been held in Gaza for 498 days. The hostages are expected to be handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which will transport them out of Hamas-controlled territory before their return to Israel. This release comes as part of an ongoing agreement, in which Israel is expected to free 369 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the return of the three captives.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b15kph6tje	2025-02-14T21:43:34-08:00	
Senior UN peacekeeping officer injured as Hezbollah supporters at...	Terror group's supporters attack UNIFIL convoy near Beirut airport amid protests over Lebanon blocking an Iranian flight allegedly carrying cash for Hezbollah; UN and US condemn violence as Lebanon’s army warns of escalating unrest A senior UN peacekeeping officer was injured Friday as Hezbollah supporters attacked a UNIFIL convoy near Beirut’s international airport, in a second consecutive night of violent protests over Lebanon’s decision to block an Iranian flight suspected of carrying funds for the terrorist group. Videos circulating on Arab media show dozens of Hezbollah supporters gathering at the scene, where UN peacekeepers were forced to flee. Protesters also torched one of the UN vehicles, and a child was filmed boasting about stealing equipment from a UN officer. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) confirmed that the injured officer was a Nepalese deputy commander, condemning the attack as a 'blatant violation of international law' that could constitute a war crime. The violence comes amid growing tensions in Lebanon following Israel’s warning against Iranian flights allegedly transferring millions of dollars to Hezbollah. The Iranian Mahan Air flight, scheduled to depart Tehran for Beirut on Thursday, was grounded after the IDF issued a rare public threat against civilian flights suspected of smuggling funds to Hezbollah. According to Israeli intelligence reports, the plane was carrying millions in cash to help Hezbollah recover from losses sustained in the recent war with Israel. On Wednesday, Israeli fighter jets conducted a sonic boom over Beirut, a move seen as a direct warning to Hezbollah operatives. Following the Israeli warning, two separate Mahan Air flights to Beirut were canceled, sparking Hezbollah-backed protests outside Rafic Hariri International Airport in the Lebanese capital. Lebanese security forces dispersed the initial demonstrations on Thursday night, but violence escalated on Friday, targeting both the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL peacekeepers. UN Secretary-General António Guterres issued a strong condemnation, saying: 'I strongly condemn the attack on a UNIFIL convoy near Beirut airport, where several peacekeepers were injured by demonstrators. A UN vehicle was also set on fire. Such attacks are absolutely unacceptable, and those responsible must be held accountable. UN personnel and property must be protected at all times. Attacks against peacekeepers violate international law and may constitute war crimes.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The U.S. State Department also denounced the violence, blaming Hezbollah supporters for the attack on UN forces. 'The United States condemns the violent attack on a UNIFIL convoy in Beirut, reportedly carried out by Hezbollah supporters, injuring multiple UN peacekeepers. We commend the Lebanese Army’s swift response to prevent further violence and urge the Lebanese government to take all necessary measures to bring the perpetrators to justice.' The Lebanese Army, which has been struggling to maintain stability amid Hezbollah’s growing influence, warned that the unrest could spiral into broader internal conflict. 'Several areas, including the airport zone, have witnessed violent protests involving assaults on soldiers, attacks on UNIFIL vehicles, and attempts to block airport roads,' the Lebanese military said in a statement. 'The army will act firmly to prevent further disturbances and safeguard public order. We caution against actions that could inflame tensions and destabilize the country during this critical period.' Following the violent clashes, the Hezbollah-affiliated network Al Manar initially distanced itself from the demonstrators, describing them as 'unruly elements'. However, the wording of the report was later removed, raising questions about Hezbollah’s role in orchestrating the protests. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sktdnnafyl	2025-02-14T21:38:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/14/HJY67GpY1g/HJY67GpY1g_0_236_406_229_0_small.jpg
Hamas and Islamic Jihad stage propaganda event ahead of hostage r...	Terror groups prepare propaganda-filled hostage release, set to free Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn and Sasha Trupanov after 498 days in captivity; Trupanov’s mother lobbied Russia for his release, while Dekel-Chen meets his daughter for the first time; Israel to free 369 Palestinian prisoners in exchange Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) are preparing a highly choreographed release of three Israeli hostages in Khan Younis, with a stage already set featuring propaganda banners in broken Hebrew, according to footage published in Arabic media on Saturday morning. Dozens of Hamas and PIJ operatives were seen gathering at the site, which prominently displays images of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem alongside Hamas footage of the October 7 attacks on Israeli communities and clashes with Israeli forces. One banner references U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed evacuation plan for Gaza, declaring: 'No migration except to Jerusalem.' The sixth round of the hostage-prisoner exchange deal will see Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, Yair Horn, 46, and Alexander 'Sasha' Trupanov, 29, freed. The three men were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz and have been held captive for 498 days in Gaza. The location of the handover ceremony appears to have been carefully chosen to showcase the destruction in Khan Younis, allegedly just feet from the house of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was killed in a clash with Israeli forces last October. Flags of Arab states that have opposed the displacement of Gazans have also been displayed at the site. Trupanov, a 29-year-old from Tel Aviv, was kidnapped while visiting his mother Yelena and grandmother Irena Tati with girlfriend Sapir Cohen at Kibbutz Nir Oz. His father, Vitaliy Trupanov, was murdered in the October 7 attack. His mother, grandmother and girlfriend were freed in the November 2023 hostage exchange, but Sasha remained in captivity, held by PIJ. Russia had been actively lobbying for Trupanov’s release, as he holds Russian citizenship, and Hamas had assured the Kremlin he would be freed. PIJ released a new video of Trupanov on Friday, purportedly showing him walking and fishing on a beach in Gaza. However, previous propaganda videos showed him pleading for food and water under clear signs of duress. 'A year that I have been here in captivity, a year in which there is a shortage of food and water, no electricity,' Trupanov said in an earlier video. 'Please, please, don’t forget about us. Go out and demonstrate.' Brothers Yair and Eitan Horn were both abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, where Eitan had been visiting from Kfar Saba. Their mother, Ruthie Horn, has spent nearly 500 days awaiting news of their fate. While Yair, 46, is set for release on Saturday, Eitan, 38, remains in captivity, as he is not included in the first phase of the release deal. In the lead-up to the exchange, Ruthie said she tried to shut out the noise of the media: 'I don't listen, I don't hear, it's not healthy. I just hope that this time things will happen. That Bibi [Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] will fix what hasn't been done yet—and bring them all home.' As she prepares to reunite with Yair, she remains focused on the son still missing: 'I'm waiting for both my children to be here,' she said. 'We've thought about what to bring him, what to do, but honestly, it's different for us—because I'm still waiting for both my boys.' Dekel-Chen, 36, from Nir Oz, is expected to experience a deeply emotional reunion—meeting his newborn daughter for the first time. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: During the attack on October 7, 2023, Sagui’s wife, Avital, was seven months pregnant. She hid in the safe room with their two daughters, Gali and Bar, while Sagui was abducted. Before being taken, he told his wife there was no way to survive, as no Israeli forces had arrived to defend the kibbutz. In the 498 days since, Avital gave birth to their daughter, Shahar, who is now over a year old. On Friday afternoon, Avital shared a post on social media featuring her and their daughters, playing together at home. 'Updating everyone—Daddy is coming home,' she wrote. In the video, their middle daughter, Gali, excitedly shouts, 'Daddy!' when asked who is returning. Dekel-Chen was known for walking barefoot and working in Columbus, a convenience store built into a bus. His daughter Bar recalled: 'He’s really sweet and such a good dad. He always wears torn shirts and never wears shoes. I love going with him to the store because it’s fun there, and you can eat candy.' In exchange for Sagui, Sasha and Yair, Israel will release 369 Palestinian prisoners, including 36 convicted of crimes serious enough to have received life sentences. Among those set for release: Ahmed Barghouti, former aide to the Fatah secretary-general in the West Bank; Mohammed Sharaia, a Palestinian Authority police officer who murdered Israeli officer Moshe Dayan in 2002; Mansour Muqada, who murdered Dr. Mordechai Shafir in 2001; and Samir Aite, who orchestrated a terrorist attack that killed Moran Amit in 2002. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjr7ts6yyx	2025-02-14T21:16:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/ryXLProTY1e/ryXLProTY1e_0_172_1280_721_0_small.jpg

The terror group holding Sasha Trupanov captive for 497 days has released a video of him walking along a Gaza beach without specifying when it was filmed, just hours before expected release along with Sagui Dekel-Chen and Yair Horn The Islamic Jihad released a video Friday showing a new sign of life from Sasha Trupanov, just hours before he is set to be freed on Saturday as part of the sixth phase of the hostage deal. Trupanov is set to be released alongside Sagui Dekel-Chen and Yair Horn who have been held by Hamas. The video, which does not specify when it was filmed, shows Trupanov 'walking' on a Gaza beach and fishing. At the family's request, Ynet has not published the video. The video appears to be aimed at portraying Trupanov as healthy, amid public outrage over the release of three malnourished hostages last week—Eli Sharabi, Or Levy, and Ohad Ben-Ami—following the previous phase of the deal. These hostages, along with others released earlier, testified about the severe deprivation they faced in captivity. It should be noted that both they and previously freed hostages reported receiving significantly more food in the days leading up to their release, likely part of a deliberate display by terrorist organizations to suggest that hostages were held under better conditions.

Yelena and Irina were released in the November 2023 prisoner exchange. Sasha’s father, Vitali, was killed in the massacre. Sasha remains in the custody of Islamic Jihad, which has previously released two videos of him during captivity. In these videos, Sasha is seen speaking to the camera, presumably reading statements dictated by his captors. 'I've been here for a year, a year with food and water shortages, and no electricity,' he said in one of the videos. Yelena, a Sabbath observer, arrived earlier in the day at the forward reception point where she will reunite with her son at the Re'im camp on Saturday. She called on the people of Israel to pray for the safe return of all hostages. 'Pray for their safe return, and ask for peace, tranquility, and safety for Israel and the people of Israel,' she said. Sasha also holds Russian citizenship, and throughout the war, Hamas has assured Russia that he will be freed. A young engineer at Amazon, Sasha had moved to Ramat Gan with Sapir a month before the massacre. Friends describe him as a humble, quiet person who enjoys sports and has a regular routine of meeting friends for coffee. His mother, Yelena, has previously said, 'I am waiting to hug my only son. He is my heart and soul. Without him, I have no life.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r111kfn6kjg	2025-02-14T12:31:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/23/rJ11SyrEMa/rJ11SyrEMa_1_57_574_323_0_small.jpg

Freed hostage Ofer Calderon re-hospitalized due to pneumonia	Ofer Calderon contracted the flu, which progressed to pneumonia, but his condition is improving, and he remains under close medical supervision, his family says; Calderon was freed from captivity in Gaza two weeks ago and discharged from Sheba Medical Center only days ago Ofer Calderon, who was freed in the fourth part of the hostage deal two weeks ago, has been rehospitalized with pneumonia, his family said Friday. 'A few days after being discharged from Sheba Medical Center, Ofer contracted the flu, which developed into pneumonia, requiring readmission,' the family said in a statement. 'He is under close observation and receiving care from the wonderful medical staff looking after him.' To protect his recovery, Calderon is limiting contact with people outside his immediate family. He spent Friday dinner in his hospital room with his brother Nisan and sister-in-law Sharon. His condition is improving, and he is expected to be discharged soon. Professor Hagai Levine, head of the health division at the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, stressed the vulnerability of former captives. 'Survivors of captivity suffer from suppressed immune systems due to malnutrition and extreme stress,' he said. 'Ofer is receiving dedicated care, and we wish him a full recovery. Caregivers should be vaccinated against the flu and avoid contact if they are sick. But who is protecting those still held hostage? We need a complete deal now.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On Monday, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum released Calderon’s first public statement since his release: 'After the first deal ended, my conditions—and those of many other hostages—became even worse. We cannot stop this deal. Hamas is a cruel enemy that will not hesitate to harm those left behind. 'I was freed after 484 days in Hamas tunnels without sunlight, without access to news, enduring severe hunger and months without a shower or proper care. We must bring everyone home as soon as possible.' Calderon, 54, was kidnapped alongside his children, Sahar and Erez, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. The children were freed in a previous deal in November 2023. After Calderon’s release earlier this month, he was finally reunited with all four of his children. His 16-year-old daughter, Sahar, who had been separated from him in Hamas tunnels, wrote on Instagram at the time: 'I promised him I would fight for him and that he would come home—and I kept my promise. I won.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry3cdztfyl	2025-02-14T10:36:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/14/SyVfqWTtJg/SyVfqWTtJg_0_66_423_238_0_small.jpg
Arab proposal for Gaza in works, but Jordan can't take more Pales...	Arab countries are putting together a plan that would rebuild Gaza without displacing its people, and guarantee security and governance, Jordan's foreign minister said on Friday, adding that his country could not take more Palestinians. Arab countries were dismayed earlier this month after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a plan to 'clean out' Palestinians from Gaza and resettle most of them in Jordan and Egypt, an idea immediately rejected by Cairo and Amman and seen in most of the region as deeply destabilizing. 'Just to answer you unequivocally, 35% of our population are refugees, we cannot afford any more, we cannot have Palestinians coming to Jordan. They don't want to come to Jordan and we don't want them to come to Jordan,' Ayman Safadi said at the Munich Security Conference.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkpgpg6t1x	2025-02-14T10:22:17-08:00

Their daughter, Shachar, was born while he was still in captivity. Bar, their other daughter, fondly described her father as 'cute' and 'a really good dad' who loves working with buses. 'He likes fixing them and making them cool for other people,' she said. Shachar’s return is the culmination of tireless efforts by her family, including lobbying the U.S. government for his release.

Hamas to release 3 hostages from Khan Younis on Saturday morning	Hostages, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn, and Sasha Trupanov will be released from Gaza’s Khan Younis as part of the sixth prisoner exchange; They will be transferred to Israeli authorities, with medical care and reunions with their families planned afterward Hostages Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn, and Sasha Trupanov are expected to be released from a single location in Khan Younis, the same site where two hostages, Ofer Calderon and Yarden Bibas, were released two weeks ago. The hostages are expected to be handed over to the International Red Cross in the morning, between 8 and 10 a.m., with Hamas and the Islamic Jihad likely using the transfer as a display of power, as they have done in previous exchanges. After being handed over to the Red Cross, the hostages will be transferred to Israeli forces in Gaza and reunited with their families at the initial reception point in the Re’im Camp. Following a medical evaluation, they will be flown by helicopter to the Sheba and Sourasky medical centers in Israel.

'These are sensitive moments for the hostages and their families, and we ask for privacy to be respected to ensure their safe return, recovery, and rehabilitation.' Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, while his wife, Avital, then seven months pregnant, hid in the safe room with their two young daughters. Before Hamas terrorists reached him, Dekel-Chen managed to tell his wife that no Israeli forces were coming to defend the kibbutz. Avital and their daughters remained safe, and in his absence, their third child, Shahar, was born. His family has been at the forefront of U.S. lobbying efforts, advocating for his release. Sasha Trupanov, 29, from Tel Aviv, was visiting his mother, Yelena, and grandmother, Irena Tati, at Kibbutz Nir Oz when Hamas launched its attack. His father Vitaliy was murdered, and Trupanov, along with his mother, grandmother, and girlfriend Sapir Cohen, was taken hostage. The women were freed in the November 2023 hostage deal, but Trupanov remained in captivity under Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Yair Horn, 46, was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz alongside his younger brother, Eitan, who had come to visit from Kfar Saba. Their family had immigrated to Israel from Argentina, and their mother, Ruthie Horn, said they only received confirmation of Yair being alive from freed hostages in November 2023.

Israeli warning grounds Iranian flight suspected of carrying Mill...	Iranian Mahan Air flight to Lebanon was halted in Tehran after an Israeli warning, as it allegedly carried millions in cash for Hezbollah; The move, backed by US pressure, led Lebanon to deny landing rights, sparking protests and diplomatic tensions with Iran An Iranian Mahan Air flight bound for Lebanon was grounded in Tehran after an Israeli warning, as the plane was reportedly carrying millions in cash from Iran to Hezbollah. The funds were intended to help the terror group recover from the blows it has sustained in its ongoing war with Israel, according to a report on Friday. The incident follows a sonic boom over Beirut by Israeli fighter jets two days ago, intended to intimidate Hezbollah operatives and reinforce Israel’s stance against ceasefire violations. Israeli intelligence identified the Mahan Air flight in advance, prompting a warning late Wednesday night from IDF Arabic-language spokesman Avichay Adraee. He cautioned that Israel would act against civilian flights used to transfer Iranian funds to Hezbollah—an implicit threat that Beirut’s airport could become a target. As a result, the Mahan Air flight, originally scheduled to depart Tehran for Beirut at 2:30 p.m. Thursday was canceled. Another flight by the airline, scheduled for Friday, was also postponed. The disruption sparked protests by Hezbollah supporters outside Beirut’s airport, leading to rare clashes with the Lebanese army, which forcibly dispersed demonstrators blocking access roads. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to Lebanon’s Al-Akhbar, a newspaper aligned with Hezbollah, the United States alerted Lebanon’s government—via the ceasefire monitoring committee—that Israel had intelligence indicating the Mahan Air flight was carrying cash for Hezbollah. The U.S. reportedly warned that Israel was determined to prevent the plane from landing, leaving Lebanon with little choice but to comply. Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam instructed Transport Minister Faiz Rasami to deny the aircraft landing rights, forcing the cancellation. The plane had around 300 Lebanese passengers, mostly returning from religious pilgrimages in Iran. Hezbollah’s media outlets condemned the move, accusing the government of 'surrendering to Israeli threats and American dictates.' To resolve the crisis, Lebanon’s national carrier, Middle East Airlines, planned to send planes to retrieve the stranded passengers. However, Lebanese reports indicated that Iran had not approved the request, insisting that it be processed through diplomatic channels. As of Friday, the passengers remained stranded in Tehran. Iran condemns Israel’s actions Iran’s government reacted angrily, issuing a formal condemnation of Israel. 'The threat against an Iranian civilian aircraft carrying Lebanese citizens is a continuation of Israel’s violations of international law and Lebanon’s sovereignty,' Iran’s Foreign Ministry said. Tehran urged international aviation organizations to take 'serious action' against Israel’s 'dangerous conduct' toward civilian air travel. This is not the first time a Mahan Air flight has been caught in such a controversy. In January, Lebanese authorities delayed unloading cargo from a Mahan Air flight suspected of carrying Iranian cash for Hezbollah. Security forces also searched the luggage of an Iranian diplomat on board. That incident led to protests in Hezbollah strongholds in Beirut, with motorbike convoys waving the group’s flags in defiance. Throughout the ongoing war, several Mahan Air flights bound for Lebanon have reportedly been forced to turn back mid-flight, underscoring the growing pressure on Hezbollah’s supply lines. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjtzjchkjl	2025-02-14T06:33:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/07/27/HkD3kmJT9/HkD3kmJT9_0_146_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
IAEA chief sees time running out to revive Iran nuclear deal	Time is running out to get an accord to rein in Iran's nuclear program as Tehran continues to accelerate its enrichment of uranium to near weapons grade, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said on Friday.

Afghan national confesses to Munich car ramming, prosecutor cites...	Assailant leaves vehicle shouting 'Allahu akbar' (God is great) after wounding dozens; under investigation for 36 counts of attempted murder An Afghan national has admitted to purposefully driving into a crowd in the German city of Munich and authorities have determined an Islamist motive for the crime, a prosecutor said on Friday. At least 36 people including a toddler were hurt on Thursday when the 24-year-old man ploughed into demonstrators gathered in the city centre, putting security back in focus before next week's federal election. 'He has admitted that he deliberately drove into the participants of the demonstration,' lead prosecutor Gabriele Tilmann said, adding that the suspect, under investigation on 36 counts of attempted murder, had spoken German in a two-hour interrogation. 'I'm very cautious about making hasty judgements, but based on everything we know at the moment, I would venture to speak of an Islamist motivation for the crime,' she added. Officers fired on his car after the attack, but the suspect was not hit. According to Tilmann, he subsequently said the words 'Allahu akbar' ('God is greatest') and prayed in the presence of police. The attack came hours before leaders including U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy arrived in the southern city for the Munich Security Conference, but police said there was no link between the two events. Store detective Tilmann said there was no evidence to suggest the suspect, identified as Farhad Noori, was affiliated with any Islamist or terrorist organisations. She added that there was no indication of accomplices, but that investigators were evaluating his communications - mostly in Dari, a language spoken in Afghanistan - and items obtained during searches to ascertain whether anyone had prior knowledge of the crime or was involved. A Munich court was to decide later on Friday whether Noori would remain in investigative custody. German authorities say the Afghan national arrived in Germany as an unaccompanied minor in 2016, and that he was in Germany legally and had been working as a store detective. Tilmann said Noori had used social media to present himself as a bodybuilder and an athlete, and had also posted religious content. He did not have any prior convictions and had not been due for deportation, deputy police chief Christian Huber said, correcting false police statements from the day before that were seized upon by conservative and far-right politicians. That false information had been announced 'in the chaos of the early hours,' he said.

All four were abducted by the terrorists. The women were later freed in the November 2023 deal, but Sacha remained in the hands of his captors from the Islamic Jihad. In a video posted by the Islamist group Sacha described his condition. 'A year that I have been here in captivity, a year in which there is a shortage of food and water, no electricity,' he said in the psychological warfare clip. 'I want to remind the citizens of Israel, every time you eat something or drink something, remember us hostages, we don't have this opportunity to enjoy the food and water you eat or drink,' he said. 'Please, please, don't forget about us. I am asking you, citizens of Israel, please, please, go out and demonstrate.'

Netanyahu, Trump discuss level of US support for Israeli strike o...	Support could range from active military support - such as intelligence, refueling or other assistance, to political backing for a coercive ultimatum; After Biden administration rejects Israel's requests, decision now in the hands of Trump Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed the levels of American backing in an Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites, ranging from active military support - such as intelligence, refueling or other assistance, to political backing for a coercive ultimatum, according to a report by the Washington Post's David Ignatius in an article published late on Thursday. According to the report the United States has already provided Israel with bunker-busting bombs that could severely damage Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges and other equipment buried in a mountain fortress in Fordow, near Qom. Ignatius quoted American and Israeli officials who said that if Iran refuses a 'Libya-style abandonment' of its nuclear facilities, Israel would strike them with or without American support. The decision of the Biden administration not to support Israel's ultimatum, is now put to Trump. According to reporting in major U.S. media outlets in recent days, American intelligence reports claimed that Washington believed an Israeli strike on Iran would come in the first half of 2025. CNN also said that Israel intended not only to attack Iran's nuclear capabilities but to bring down the Iranian regime. The network quoted European intelligence sources who said Iran had received a shipment of over more than 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate, the main precursor in the production of the solid propellant that powers Iran’s mid-range conventional missiles. The arrival of the shipment at the Bandar Abas port in Iran was reported on Thursday, and the materials would be enough for 260 solid rocket motors for Iran’s Kheibar Shekan missiles or 200 of the Haj Qasem ballistic missiles, the network said citing the intelligence sources.

‘Clock is ticking’ on Iran, say military expert	A U.S. intelligence report indicating that Iran has significantly resumed uranium enrichment. According to the report, the country is now just steps away from obtaining as many as five nuclear bombs Former U.S. President Donald Trump has stated his commitment to preventing Iran from ever becoming a nuclear state, warning that such a development would pose the gravest existential threat to Israel. However, instead of opting for a military strike, Trump has chosen to impose sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Or Yissachar of Israel’s Defense and Security Forum told ILTV News that he believes Trump will soon realize that Iran is merely stalling for time. 'The Iranians will try to fudge things up and to sort of buy time like they always do, and we are just minutes away from a nuclear weapon,' Yissachar said. He pointed to a U.S. intelligence report indicating that Iran has significantly resumed uranium enrichment. According to the report, the country is now just steps away from obtaining as many as five nuclear bombs, should it choose to do so. 'I think we’re running out of time, and the clock is ticking right now,' Yissachar warned. 'The decision is the president’s to make, but Israel will always reserve the right to strike Iran, if so it chooses, in order to deny it from a nuclear weapon.'

The ministry spokesperson said Australia was spreading 'false narratives'.

What does hell look like?	According to Dan Perry, former chief editor of the Associated Press in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, Trump could authorize Israel to resume the war with even greater force than before Hamas backtracked on its threat not to release any more Israeli hostages after former U.S. President Donald Trump warned that if the hostages were not freed by Saturday, 'all hell would break loose.' What does Donald Trump's hell look like? According to Dan Perry, former chief editor of the Associated Press in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, Trump could authorize Israel to resume the war with even greater force than before. 'I suppose in some version of the universe that might terrify Hamas, but not in my version of the universe, because these are nihilist jihadis who thrive off the destruction of their own territory, the suffering of their own people,' Perry said Tuesday on ILTV News' Insider. 'I think Trump's greater leverage might be on the Arab states that, to various degrees, support, enable, acquiesce to, or maybe even are fearful of taking on Hamas.' Perry suggested these states could include Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and especially Qatar, which maintains a delicate relationship with the United States while hosting an important American military base. 'It’s not clear who has leverage over whom in this situation, but Qatar does like to make nice with the world,' Perry said. 'They like to pretend they’re a normative country, and that doesn’t really go hand in hand with supporting a terror group.' Watch previous episodes of Insider: Should Israel Consider a Nuclear Strike on Iran? Will Trump’s Return Rewrite Middle East History? Netanyahu or Hamas: Who’s Really to Blame for the Ceasefire Delays? In contrast, Pesach Wolicki, executive director of Israel365 Action, told Insider that the real power of Trump’s warning lies not in an actual threat of destruction or war but in the speculation it creates. 'This whole speculation, the whole doubt, is really part of what Donald Trump’s game plan is,' Wolicki said. He called it 'refreshing' to see a U.S. president navigate Middle East negotiations more effectively than most Western leaders. He added that one of the great ironies of Trump’s presidency is that, despite entering office in 2016 with no foreign policy experience, he seems to handle the region better than many of his predecessors. In the past, Wolicki noted, Arab leaders would stake out extreme positions, knowing that over time, Israel would shift closer to their demands. They would simply wait it out. But Trump changed the paradigm. When Hamas threatened to stop releasing hostages, he didn’t return to the negotiating table or plead for the deal to continue. Instead, he issued an ultimatum: release them all by Saturday at midnight—or else. 'It is a negotiating ploy that I think is the right way to play,' Wolicki said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkfkmvntyx	2025-02-13T21:38:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/SkOTAFvF1g/SkOTAFvF1g_0_194_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Here's how Israelis celebrated Tu Bishvat on Thursday	This unique holiday highlights Israel’s vibrant nature—everything from trees to flowers—symbolizing renewal and restoration Thursday was Tu Bishvat in Israel, a holiday marking the new year for trees and a celebration of the country's natural beauty. This unique holiday highlights Israel’s vibrant nature—everything from trees to flowers—symbolizing renewal and restoration. Traditionally, Israelis celebrate with a Tu Bishvat Seder, a meal featuring dried fruits, nuts, and other early-season foods. Each item is accompanied by a special blessing, recited together. Many Israelis also mark the occasion by planting trees, strengthening their connection to the land. Tu Bishvat symbolizes renewal and rebirth, as trees in Israel begin to recover from winter, filling with fresh green leaves and colorful blossoms ahead of spring. Israel’s history is deeply tied to nature. In the early 20th century, much of the land was covered in swamps and disease-ridden pools. However, determined Jewish pioneers transformed the landscape, turning it into the agriculturally rich tapestry we know today. Tu Bishvat is a holiday for all Israelis to enjoy—a time to celebrate nature, honor history, and savor the fruits of the Holy Land.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1herinyke	2025-02-13T21:12:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/17/Skn1RKLa0/Skn1RKLa0_0_234_1280_721_0_small.jpg

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio referred to the 'day after' in the Gaza Strip, saying that his upcoming visit to the Gulf is intended to examine an alternative plan by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, instead of that of President Donald Trump. According to him, if the Arab countries do not have a concrete proposal, Israel will be forced to act on its own. 'All the countries in the region say how much they care about the Palestinians, but none of them want to take them,' Rubio said. 'If the Arab countries have a better plan for Gaza, that's great. But obviously any plan that leaves Hamas there will be a problem.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjoeqenykx	2025-02-13T14:04:27-08:00	
Donkey food, poor hygiene and fear of the IDF': Parents of relea...	Parents say hostages endured unimaginable hardships: cursed by captors, sharing rooms with terrorists, n electricity and wearing the same pair of underwear since October 7; The parents of Karina, Liri and Naama recount how their daughters struggle to speak of the horrors Weeks after returning to Israel following 477 days in captivity, a stark contrast remains between the relative openness of the released IDF lookouts about their time in Gaza and their silence regarding the events of October 7. While they have spoken in detail to their families about their conditions in captivity — the constant life-threatening danger, their captors' treatment, hunger and poor hygiene — they avoid discussing what happened in the shelter at the Nahal Oz base that Saturday. During those hours, they waited in vain for help, were beaten by terrorists and watched their comrades killed before their eyes. 'She just doesn’t talk about it,' said Albert Ariev, father of Karina Ariev. 'What happened in that shelter was horrific. It makes her rehabilitation even harder — I can see it. Something terrible happened to my daughter on October 7. The captivity wasn't easy but the nightmare is split into two parts.' Why is what happened in the shelter off-limits, while she discusses more than a year in captivity? 'She says she saw and experienced terrible things there. She was severely wounded and told us that she wanted to die on that day. She wished for an airstrike to end her suffering. They abused and beat her endlessly. That’s it — she won’t go further. She just says, 'I went through hell that day and wished to die.' It was the worst day of her entire period in captivity.' Since the second hostage deal began, Israelis have struggled to process the harrowing accounts of those who returned. The challenge is even greater for their families, mixing relief with the horror of what they endured. Ynet spoke with three parents of the five released observers: Albert Ariev, father of Karina; Shira Albag, mother of Liri Albag and Yoni Levy, father of Naama Levy. They all agreed: The wounds from October 7 have not begun to heal yet. Shira Albag: 'October 7 is as much a trauma as captivity and we haven't even begun addressing it. They saw their friends murdered and then sat there for four hours. Liri told me, 'Mom, we’ll have to process that later.' She hasn't spoken about what happened there. 'At the time, they thought it had only happened at their base — they had no idea of the scale. Only after four days, when they met other hostages, did they start to grasp the full picture. It took time for them to realize how many people were kidnapped.' 'Liri heard radio broadcasts and watched TV, mostly Al Jazeera. When she and her friends learned Arabic, they understood the situation — there was a war. They knew about the first hostage deal because people held with them were released. 'The captors made sure to hide anything relevant from them, except for negative news about Israel — saying there were no agreements, no efforts to bring them back. They used psychological terror, telling them, 'We’ll marry you off and convert you to Islam.'' 'October 7 is as much a trauma as captivity and we haven't even begun addressing it. They saw their friends murdered and then sat there for four hours.' Yoni Levy: 'Naama was exposed to the famous image of her from October 7. People told her about it — there was no way around it. She became famous against her will. From what little she’s shared, the real trauma, the breaking point and the most horrifying scenes were on October 7. Her world collapsed on that day.' Bread made of donkey food The upright posture and piercing gaze of the four lookouts released on January 25 gave the impression they had been together the entire time, but in reality, they were often separated. 'Liri was with Agam Berger from day one and, at times, with Naama,' said Shira Albag. 'She wasn’t with Daniella Gilboa or Karina. They have a deep connection. They experienced something we will never understand. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'They don’t talk about it — when they meet, they just hold hands in silence and understand each other. Each of them went through it alone but their bond gave them strength. Even now, outside of captivity, being together helps them cope.' Did they see the Hamas videos of them? 'They saw them on TV. Their captors made sure they did. But Liri told me, 'Mom, it passed quickly.' They didn’t dwell on it. Not like us, who watched them over and over for days.' Where was Liri held? 'She was in both houses and tunnels. Mostly homes. The tunnels drove her crazy with the silence, even though they technically had more freedom to move. But they were humid and eerily quiet — total silence. At least in the houses she could hear movement outside, which helped her feel that something was happening.' 'The houses she was in belonged to families with children and those kids cursed at her, spat on her and threatened her. We’ll have to deal with these kids when they grow up to be terrorists. That’s our reality in the Middle East.' What did they eat? How did they maintain hygiene? 'Sometimes they got two meals a day; sometimes they had nothing for days. At times, they ate food meant for donkeys. They made pita bread from it because there was no flour. Hygiene was minimal. Liri wore the same underwear from October 7. As women, we understand what that means — it’s not easy. They got sick a lot.' How did they pass the time? 'With a lot of thoughts and imagination. They played word-association games. They all kept diaries but weren’t allowed to take anything out of captivity. They also sang — rewriting lyrics to familiar songs.' Anger at the state Karina, on the other hand, preferred staying in tunnels. 'She had a logical explanation,' said Albert Ariev. 'Being above ground in Gaza was a death trap. She preferred to be underground because there were constant airstrikes above. 'Some days, they were moved while buildings collapsed around them, with shrapnel flying everywhere. She just wanted to be somewhere safe — even if it was a tunnel. She didn’t care as long as she survived.' 'Sometimes they got two meals a day; sometimes they had nothing for days. At times, they ate food meant for donkeys.' What were the conditions like? 'They only had cold water and washed with a funnel. She had no spare underwear but asked for a toothbrush and got one. There was no electricity. Some days, she didn’t leave her bed. They could move between locations, but they were stuck in a room for a month at times.' How was the food? 'She said it was 'not tasty,' but she forced herself to eat. She ate whatever the terrorists ate. During tough times, they gave them their own food.' Karina spent more than a year with Daniella Gilboa. How did they pass the time? 'My daughter came back speaking fluent Arabic. It’s surreal. She translates Al Jazeera for us. They also wrote songs. They enlisted together, served at the Nahal Oz base for nine months and were among the few lookouts who knew exactly what was happening that morning. When Karina called us, she simply said, 'War broke out. Dad, don’t come here.' That’s how she said goodbye.' 'They were a trio — Karina, Daniella and Aviv Hajaj, who was murdered in the shelter before their eyes. They were always together in the operations room, deeply bonded. That helped them survive, despite the occasional arguments in captivity.' Yoni Levy: 'Naama was held with other hostages and, at times, with some of the lookouts. There were many relocations, separations and regroupings. She’s mostly angry at Israel. She feels the state tried to kill her because it bombed the houses she was in. In one case, they barely escaped and a collapsing wall injured her. Her biggest fear was our own bombings.' How were they treated by their captors? Shira Albag: 'Liri reads people well. The moment she was taken, she understood: 'This is my reality now. I’m in Gaza and I need to survive like a Gazan.' She knew how to handle them — not by fighting, but by playing their game. 'It worked well beyond our expectations. At the same time, the terrorists slept in their room 24/7, always watching them. Every moment was a threat — one wrong word or a captor in a bad mood and everything changed.' Albert Ariev: 'The captors explained why they carried out October 7—it was the blockade, the food shortages, the power cuts. They were both angry and emotional. Karina kept her distance, avoiding debates.' 'She saw firsthand what happened when Israel bombed. She’s furious that people, including her, weren’t evacuated before the airstrikes. She knows Hamas is a terrorist group responsible for October 7, but she’s also angry at Israel because she lived through the war on both sides—as an abandoned target on October 7 and as a captive under bombardment in Gaza.' 'At the same time, the terrorists slept in their room 24/7, always watching them. Every moment was a threat — one wrong word or a captor in a bad mood and everything changed.' 'Every little thing brings them back' Even now, surrounded by loved ones, captivity lingers. Albert Ariev: 'Karina told us there were constant bombings in Gaza. Even today, she covers her ears when a helicopter flies overhead. We hope it passes with time.' Yoni Levy: 'We were at home when a passing car made some noise — something we didn't even notice — but she got terribly scared. She watched a bit of the release on Saturday and you could see it shook her. She doesn't understand what it means — whether there will be another round or not. 'We can't even explain to her what a 'humanitarian phase' means and that young people and soldiers would come later. She keeps saying, 'Everyone needs to get out of there, what don't you understand?' Even on a personal level, her recovery can't begin until it ends and everyone comes back.' Shira Albag: 'Liri said right after she was released, 'We were in hell and the boys are in an even worse hell.' We see the girls now and they look strong, like they're okay and they laugh — but nothing is okay. People need to understand that. 'We need to get everyone out urgently just so they can get close to being okay. There's no set formula for their recovery and we still don't know how to approach it. No one in this country does — not even the therapists. Everyone is learning, us and Liri too.' Did she watch the hostage release on Saturday? 'I didn't watch TV. I only looked at Liri and when I saw her reaction, I quickly told them, 'Turn it off.' I saw it wasn't good for her. She froze. Every little thing like that brings them back. I saw that even though she was home, at that moment, she was still in captivity. 'Liri said that more than once that the terrorists told them, 'When you're united, we fear you. You're strong.' They kept repeating it. That's something everyone needs to take in — the leaders and the people. Over these 15 months, I've realized the people are very united but our leadership isn't.' Albert Ariev: 'Karina also thinks about the hostages still there a lot. She said, 'Our hearts are split into 255 pieces.' Every person who doesn’t return shatters her heart. She was only with Daniella throughout captivity, but she heard from others about different hostages and knows the horrors they're enduring.' 'You can't be fully happy' The returning lookouts have modest dreams: waking up and making coffee, eating breakfast at home, opening their own closet, sleeping in their own bed and showering in their own bathroom. The small things that were taken from them for 15 months now bring them immense joy. Shira Albag: 'Everything is in her hands now and those little things do her good. Even just sitting with us and watching TV — not that we get to do much of it. Yesterday, she got a tattoo she dreamed of while in captivity and even drew it — a postage stamp with hearts and a phrase that gave her strength throughout. The funny thing is, I don't even remember what it says.' Yoni Levy: 'In her first days back, Naama really wanted to go to the sea. She said she had dreamed about it for a long time underground. Even in the hospital, there was a window and every afternoon, when there was nothing else to do, she would go look at the sunset over the sea. 'So, when we had the chance, we took her for half an hour — to see the horizon, to hear the waves. She and I are trying to figure out when she can run a few kilometers again. Sports was a big part of her life and we're looking for the first opportunity for her to reconnect with herself, with her body.' Albert Ariev: 'Karina has a long rehabilitation ahead of her. She was injured in the head and lower limbs. Her legs are full of shrapnel, which makes standing and walking for long periods difficult. She also has shrapnel in her face, so it'll take time.' What would you say to the hostages’ families still waiting? Shira Albag: 'Three weeks ago, I was in their place. Nothing I say can help — they’re at their lowest point. But you can't lose hope and faith. You have to hold onto them. Talk to the hostages, on the radio and TV. 'We don’t know who’s listening. It strengthens them. Liri didn’t hear us, only other families, and still, it gave her strength. Just by reaching out, they don’t lose hope. We're in a battle to bring them home. Liri is here, but for me, this war isn’t over until the last hostage returns.' Albag can’t hold back her tears. 'It's still hard for me,' she says. 'I see Idit, Alon Ohel’s mother, and I cry with her. Just a moment ago, Liri was in his place. You can’t be fully happy. Even Liri isn’t fully happy as long as there’s a hostage still in there.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sywga0iy1g	2025-02-13T13:47:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/25/r1zs8pHMdyl/r1zs8pHMdyl_0_99_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Crowdfunding for ex-hostage Eli Sharabi's rehabilitation raises o...	Friends of Sharabi, who returned from captivity and discovered that his family had been murdered, are leading a fundraising campaign to help him get back on track. Within hours, over a million shekels were raised: 'We can't change what happened, but we can promise Eli a new start' Eli Sharabi was held captive by Hamas for 491 days. Upon his return to Israel less than a week ago, he discovered that his family had been murdered at their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, and his brother, who was kidnapped with him, had been murdered in Gaza. Now, his friends and supporters are leading a crowdfunding campaign aimed at helping him rehabilitate and rebuild his life. Within a few hours, more over 1 million shekels had been raised. The campaign states that its goal was to raise one million shekels within 24 hours, in order to finance Sharabi's physical and mental rehabilitation, provide him with financial support, and assist him in finding suitable housing. 'Eli is coming back to life – and we are here to build him a new future,' the campaign states. 'Eli has returned to a reality that is hard to even imagine. The home he had is gone. His beloved wife, Liane, and his daughters, Noya and Yahel were murdered. His brother Yossi, who was kidnapped with him, was murdered in captivity and his body is still in Gaza. But amidst all the pain, there is one thing that is invincible: Eli's spirit.' The message from the campaign also said: 'We cannot change what was, but we can guarantee Eli a new beginning. Physical and mental rehabilitation, a life with meaning, real support – it is in our hands. The goal: one million shekels in 24 hours. The time: now. There is no later. The power: you. Everyone who donates, everyone who shares changes Eli's fate. Eli belongs to all of us. Today, we are all his family. Donate now, share, be part of this great thing.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sharabi's friend, Sharon Adam, one of the project's initiators, told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth about the idea of ​​raising money for his rehabilitation 'Eli's friends and I thought about what could be done for him and we realized that there was also a desire from the people to help him recover after everything he went through, and we don't know what will happen to him. It's also not clear what he is supposed to receive from the state, so we decided to raise money for him to help him with the long rehabilitation that awaits him,' she explained. The campaign that went live on Thursday morning, on Sharabi's birthday, has so far raised over 1.2 million shekels. 'I'm surprised by the pace,' said Adam. 'There are amazing people in the country. Eli is aware of the extent of the support he receives and he is shocked by what he sees. He doesn't understand why he receives this love and he gets excited about everything. He tears up many times from small gestures and is grateful to the team that is taking care of him. He is very excited.' Aden added that 'from the moment I saw him get out of the Hamas car and he was thin and emaciated and everyone here was crying, I smiled because he arrived in relatively good condition compared to what he could have been and in a condition that was relatively easy to fix physically. We told him we thought they would break him and he said 'they don't have a chance'. He is sad and it will take time to recover, but he is a strong man.'

Texas measles outbreak hits at least 22 children and two adults	At least 24 cases of measles have been reported in an outbreak in Gaines County, Texas, state officials said, warning that more cases of the highly contagious disease were likely to surface. None of the infected people in the community, about 90 miles southwest of Lubbock, Texas, and near the New Mexico state line, were vaccinated, the Texas Department of State Health Services said in an alert on February 11. Twenty-two were children and two were adults. Nine people have been hospitalized. The outbreak marks a jump in the known measles cases in the U.S., with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reporting only 14 other cases in the country so far this year. Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, meaning there was no continuous transmission of the disease for a year. The virus can spread via travelers from countries where measles is common.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjdiurikje	2025-02-13T11:33:17-08:00

Educator says she intended to show fifth grade students footage of Magen David Adom activities but mistakenly played emergency service reels from murderous attack A teacher at a school in central Israel’s Tzur Yigal exposed fifth-grade students to a graphic video from the October 7 massacre during a lesson. The footage included severed limbs, gunshot victims and the screams of the wounded. Some students panicked, with several breaking down in tears and later experiencing anxiety. A school probe found that the teacher had intended to show a video about Magen David Adom’s (MDA) activities but mistakenly played a different video from the MDA depicting the October 7atrocities. She was unaware of the mistake as she had left the classroom after starting the video. Parents reported their children were in shock and distress. 'This is exactly what we’ve tried to shield them from for the past year and a half. The kids are severely traumatized,' one mother said. 'This is a serious incident that occurred during an extracurricular lesson taught by an external instructor not employed by the ministry,' The Education Ministry said in a statement.

IDF spokesman reveals Iran’s Quds Force attempted to transfer funds to Hezbollah via civilian flights, prompting Lebanon to block an Iranian plane from landing; Terror group supporters protest decision IDF spokesman in Arabic Col. Avichay Adraee said on Wednesday that Israel located Iran's Quds Force transferring funds to Hezbollah via civilian flights in order to 'carry out attacks against Israel.' He warned that the IDF would prevent such arms transfers. Following the Israeli warning, Lebanon’s Al-Jadeed news outlet reported that Lebanese authorities refused to accept an Iranian Mahan Air passenger plane scheduled to fly from Tehran to Beirut. In protest, Hezbollah supporters blocked the road to the Beirut airport, burned tires and clashed with security forces. Stranded passengers in Iran also expressed anger.

Family of hostage Segev Kalfon says received a sign of life from ...	Segev was kidnapped from the Nova festival and has spent 496 days in Hamas captivity; released hostages told his family that he is still alive; Despite his medical problems, Segev is not on the list of hostages to be released in the first phase of the deal; The family found out he had been taken to Gaza when they saw a video clip showing him being loaded into a van by terrorists Another sign of life has been received for a hostage who is not included on the list of those to be released in phase one of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. The family of Segev Kalfon said that hostages who were released from captivity in the Gaza Strip have provided them with a sign of life from him. Kalfon, 27, from Dimona, was kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7 and has been in Hamas captivity for 496 days. His family discovered that he was kidnapped into Gaza after footage showed him being loaded into a pickup truck by Hamas terrorists. Segev's sister-in-law, Rotem, shared: 'We received a sign of life and we are waiting to hug him.' In an interview with Ynet this week, his family said that Segev suffers from medical problems; but despite this he was not included in the humanitarian deal, and does not appear on the list of 33 hostages whowill be released in the first phase of the deal. 'He suffers from anxiety disorders and is on medication, he has post-traumatic stress disorder from an accident he had at a young age, and he underwent surgery where he had platinum plates inserted into his leg,' said his sister-in-law Rotem. 'We understand that they could get infected, and he could need another surgery. How can you determine that someone in captivity is not a humanitarian case? We saw how they came out of captivity, extremely malnourished. How can you even sort out who is and who is not?' Galit, Segev's mother, also failed to understand the criteria used to determine who was eligible for release in the first stage and who was not. 'What we saw on Shabbat was like a punch in the stomach,' she said, referring to the sight of Ohad Ben Ami, Or Levy and Eli Sharabi, who were released emaciated and pale, and later testified to severe abuse in captivity, which included starvation and being held in chains.

My son has already marked two birthdays in captivity. He is 27 years old, and Hamas still sees him as a soldier. I don't understand how this happens - we are in a country that studies history, how come we don't learn from our past?' asks his mother. The sign of life from Segev is added to a series of signs of life received in recent days, following the return of the three hostages in the lastroundh: Or Levy, Ohad Ben Ami and Eli Sharabi. On Wednesday, another sign of life was received from a hostage who is not included in the list of those who are supposed to be released in the first phase of the deal. The Tikva Forum reported that the family of the kidnapped Eitan Mor recently received a sign of life from him. 'We are praying for the return of all the hostages, including our son Eitan,' they said. Yesterday it was learned that signs of life were recently received from the kidnapped soldier Matan Engerst and hostage Yosef Haim Ohana. Hagai Engerst, Matan's father, said that the family received a sign of life from him through kidnapped people who were released in the last few days. The evidence that the armored soldier is alive, but is injured and being held in difficult conditions, was received six months after he was seen in a psychological terror video found in Gaza. In addition, Ynet reported for the first time that Yosef's aunt, Hanna Mastronov, said: 'We have a clear indication that he is alive . There are signs of life that indicate that he is alive.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rko2r3styx	2025-02-13T10:22:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/01/07/SkbQMzV00006/SkbQMzV00006_0_140_831_468_0_small.jpg

France proposes plan to speed up Israeli troop withdrawal from Le...	France has put together a proposal for United Nations peacekeepers, including French troops, tp replace Israeli forces at key points to ensure those forces leave Lebanon by a February 18 deadline, Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Thursday. Israel's public broadcaster said on Wednesday the U.S. had authorized a 'long term' Israeli troop presence in southern Lebanon, after sources told Reuters Israel had sought an extension to a Feb. 18 deadline to withdraw its forces. Under a truce deal brokered by Washington in November, Israeli troops were granted 60 days to withdraw from southern Lebanon where they had waged a ground offensive against fighters from Lebanon's armed group Hezbollah since early October. Hezbollah combatants were to leave the zone and Lebanese troops were to deploy in the area within the same period. 'We have worked to formulate a proposal that can satisfy the security expectations of Israel which planned to stay longer at certain points on the blue line,' Barrot told reporters after a conference on Syria in Paris. He said that the proposal would see UNIFIL peacekeepers, including French forces, substituting Israeli forces at observation points and that the United Nations backed the idea.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkcyw6ofkl	2025-02-13T10:00:09-08:00

RFK Jr. to take top US health post after Senate confirmation	Robert F. Kennedy Jr, a vaccine critic who has pledged to tackle chronic disease, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as Health Secretary on Thursday, after overcoming resistance from the medical establishment and members of Congress with promises to limit his role in vaccine policy. After Kennedy is sworn into the position later on Thursday, President Donald Trump will sign an executive order to establish a MAHA commission, named for Kennedy's 'Make America Healthy Again' movement, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said on Fox News on Thursday. The order will direct the new secretary of the Health and Human Services Department 'to investigate this chronic crisis plaguing our country,' she said. The vote to confirm Kennedy was 52-48, with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the lone Republican joining all 47 Democrats to vote against Kennedy, who had made pledges to protect existing vaccination programs in a bid to secure votes of hesitant lawmakers. Once sworn in, Kennedy will oversee multiple high-profile agencies, including the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkn7ohjfjl	2025-02-13T09:23:02-08:00	
US imposes sanctions against ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan	Trump administration blocks international court official's assets and visitation rights; Khan responsible for issuing arrest warrant against Netanyahu and Gallant before being faced with sexual harassment charges Less than three months after issuing arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, which had announced plans to sanction the ICC, designated Khan, a British citizen, as its first target. He was added to a blacklist signed by Trump last week with Reuters confirming the decision to impose sanctions. The sanctions freeze Khan’s U.S. assets and bar him and his family from entering the country. The ICC condemned the move, saying, 'We will continue to provide justice and hope to millions of innocent victims worldwide.' In November 2024, after the warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant were approved, Khan said: 'With respect to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and former Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant, the judges of the International Criminal Court have found that there are reasonable grounds to believe that each has committed the war crime of using starvation as a method of warfare and crimes against humanity of murder, persecution and other inhumane acts, as a direct perpetrator, acting jointly with others. 'The Chamber also found reasonable grounds to believe that they are each responsible for the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against civilians as a superior.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Khan added, 'I appeal to all states parties to live up to their commitment to the Rome Statute by respecting and complying with these judicial orders. We count on their cooperation in this situation, as with all other situations under the court’s jurisdiction. We also welcome collaboration with non-states parties in working toward accountability and upholding international law.' After the warrants were issued, Khan became embroiled in a sexual harassment case. The British Daily Mail reported that a staff member who was allegedly assaulted by Khan told a colleague, who then reported it to senior ICC officials. Reuters later reported that the court would launch an external investigation and in a letter to member states, Khan was urged to suspend himself during the probe. Khan faced further controversy after hiring the British law firm Bindmans Lawyers, which represents several Palestinian organizations — some of which had petitioned him to issue the arrest warrants against Israeli officials — raising concerns over a clear conflict of interest. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjdkqsofkg	2025-02-13T09:10:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/21/HyU2E63fyg/HyU2E63fyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Rocket fired from Gaza at Israel lands inside strip , killing tee...	Launch during cease-fire is first since January and comes amid tensions ahead of sixth hostage handover set for Saturday; IDF sees incident as infringement on agreement A rocket was fired from Gaza toward Israel on Thursday for the first time in weeks despite the cease-fire with Hamas in Gaza and ahead of the sixth hostage exchange set for Saturday. It exploded inside the Strip’s Al-Bureij refugee camp, killing a 14-year-old boy. 'A rocket launch was identified in the Gaza Strip. The rocket fell inside the Gaza Strip. The IDF is committed to fully implementing the conditions of the agreement for the return of the hostages,' the military said in a statement. Shortly after, the Israeli Air Force carried out an airstrike on the launch site. Security officials consider the presence of the launcher in the area a violation of the agreement. Palestinian sources claimed the rocket was made from 'remnants of an Israeli missile.' The last known launch from Gaza was on January 11, with subsequent sirens proving to be false alarms.

Meanwhile, Defense Minister Israel Katz held a security assessment ahead of a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the IDF Southern Command joined by IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, incoming Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir and other senior officials.

Israel seeks to expedite release of six hostages amid cease-fire ...	International outlet reports that mediators are working to accelerate the release of six hostages set to remain in captivity after Saturday’s exchange, as Israel and Hamas trade accusations over aid delays Mediators in the hostage release and cease-fire deal with Hamas — at Israel’s request — are working to expedite the release of six living hostages included in the first phase of the deal, who will remain in captivity after the next exchange on Saturday when three more hostages are set to be freed, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. According to the report, Hamas agreed to release the three hostages as scheduled after reaching an understanding that more tents, caravans and heavy equipment for clearing rubble would be sent into Gaza. The report, citing mediator sources, did not explicitly link the efforts to accelerate the release of the six hostages to the agreement on aid deliveries. Israel has not officially confirmed the agreement, but officials previously indicated that one potential resolution could involve releasing three hostages on Saturday, followed by an expedited release of the six others rather than spreading it over two weeks. The report also detailed that Israel requested additional hostages be added to the original 33 set to be released in the first phase amid speculation that Jerusalem may seek to extend this phase rather than proceed to phase two, which involves ending the war in Gaza and securing the release of all remaining living hostages. Hamas’ response to this request remains unclear. So far, 16 hostages have been freed in the deal’s first phase along with five Thai nationals released outside the deal. Of the 33 hostages included in this phase, 17 remain — nine alive and eight dead. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a security assessment at the IDF Southern Command amid the reinforcement of Israeli forces in the south. The meeting included Defense Minister Israel Katz, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi, IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, incoming Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir, Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and other senior security officials. The crisis over the deal’s first phase remains unresolved, while tensions in Netanyahu’s coalition have emerged over its second phase. Responding to pleas from hostage families, Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Chairman Yuli Edelstein said Israel is 'unequivocally' addressing the second phase. However, Netanyahu’s spokesperson Omer Dostri contradicted him, saying: 'Contrary to Edelstein’s claim, Israel is not currently negotiating phase two of the deal.' Earlier this week, Hamas threatened to derail the deal, saying it would not release the three hostages in the sixth handover round on Saturday, citing Israeli violations of the cease-fire, particularly delays in delivering shelters for displaced Palestinians. The terror group also reportedly was angered by former U.S. President Donald Trump's call for the relocation of Gazans and delays in launching negotiations for the deal’s second phase, which were set to begin last week. In response, Israel threatened to resume the war and reinforced troops in the south, while Trump demanded all hostages be freed by Saturday at noon, suggesting Israel 'let hell break out' on Gaza if Hamas failed to comply. Amid right-wing pressure to adopt Trump's deadline, Netanyahu sent mixed signals about the number of hostages Israel expects to be released but ultimately appears to accept that only three will be freed. A message sent to ministers by Israel’s National Public Diplomacy Directorate stressed; 'We insist on upholding the agreements as they stand,' meaning three hostages released in the next exchange. Egypt and Qatar have intensified mediation efforts to salvage the release deal and cease-fire. According to Hamas and reports in both mediating countries, Hamas agreed to the hostage release after receiving assurances that caravans and medical supplies would enter Gaza immediately. While thousands of tents already have been sent in, no caravans had been delivered before now. The deal originally stipulated that Gaza would receive at least 200,000 tents and 60,000 caravans. Dozens of trucks carrying caravans and tractors were seen near the Rafah crossing Thursday morning. Netanyahu’s office denied any coordination regarding their entry but didn’t rule out their possible delivery through other border crossings, such as Kerem Shalom, after Israeli inspections. Egyptian media also reported that the equipment would enter only after security checks, as is done for all humanitarian aid trucks. Signs of a compromise emerged Wednesday, with reports of dozens of trucks carrying tents reaching northern Gaza. A total of about 800 trucks entered Gaza that day, 200 more than required by the agreement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h100l15otyg	2025-02-13T08:07:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/HJbsQHXotke/HJbsQHXotke_0_98_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

At least 28 people were hurt when a car driven by an Afghan asylum seeker ploughed into a crowd in Munich on Thursday in what the state premier said was probably an attack, putting security back in focus before next week's federal election. The suspected attack came hours before international leaders including U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy were due to arrive in the southern German city for the Munich Security Conference. Police said a white car had approached police vehicles that were accompanying a demonstration of striking workers, before speeding up and slamming into people. One shot was fired at the suspect and it was unclear if he was wounded, police added. Officers detained the 24-year-old driver. They said his motive was unclear. 'It was probably an attack,' Bavaria state premier Markus Soeder told reporters. Bavarian interior minister Joachim Herrmann said the suspect had been known to police for drug and shoplifting offences. His asylum application had been rejected, said Herrmann, but he had not been forced to leave due to security concerns in Afghanistan.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjklf5jf1e	2025-02-13T07:10:48-08:00

In a speech in Yemen, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi threatened that if the US and Israel 'attempt to implement the Trump plan by force or agree to it with the Arab regimes, we will intervene with missiles, drones, naval operations and other means'; He defiantly said that 'if Trump wants to take care of the Jews, let him give them one of the states in the US' The Houthi leader threatens in a speech in Yemen that if the United States and Israel try to implement U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for Gaza by force, 'we will intervene militarily, using missiles and drones,' and defiantly says that if 'Trump and the Americans want to take care of the Jews, let them transfer them to the United States.' In a speech, terrorist leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi said that 'Trump's plan to uproot the Palestinian people from their land and homeland is an expropriation of rights. Trump is a criminal and insists on his criminal plan that denies rights and justice. His plan is wrong and unjust, and it seems that he is serious about putting pressure on several Arab countries to accept it. We are not surprised by the plan, there is no limit to the ambitions of the American president who believes in the unjust Zionist project.' 'I call on the armed forces to be prepared for military intervention if Trump carries out his threats. We will be monitoring and coordinating with the fighters in Palestine and the resistance axis,' he said. 'Trump, who in his first term brought the 'deal of the century', has committed the 'crime of the century' in his current term,' the Houthi leader accused. 'If Trump and the United States want to take care of the Jews, they should transfer them to the United States. There are very large areas there. They can transfer the Jews to America and give them one of the states, the United States has uninhabited areas.' Throughout the current war, the Houthis launched more than 40 surface-to-surface missiles at Israel, and more than 320 drones. Al-Houthi threatened that the launches - which had stopped with the start of the cease-fire in Gaza - would be resumed in the event of an attempt to implement the Trump plan. > 'If the Americans and Israelis try to implement the plan by force or agree with the Arab regimes to implement it, we will intervene even with military force,' he threatened. 'We will intervene through missiles, drones, naval operations and other means if the U.S. and Israel implement the displacement plan by force. We will confront them with all means. We will never stand idly by in the face of a plan of attack against the Palestinians.' The Houthi leader also called in his speech for people to attend demonstrations in Sana'a and throughout Yemen on Friday, to 'send a warning message to the Israeli and American enemies against displacement or aggression.' Support marches were held in Gaza every Friday during the war, but they have no longer been held weekly since the cease-fire. Two days ago, al-Houthi also threatened Israel, saying that members of the terrorist organization 'are ready to launch attacks on it if it attacks again in Gaza and does not abide by the cease-fire agreement.' 'We will stand by the Lebanese people if the occupation decides to escalate,' he added. 'We confirm the principle of supporting the Palestinian people militarily, politically and with information. We are ready for military intervention in the event of Israeli escalation against Gaza. The Palestinian Authority is cooperating with the Israeli enemy, even these days, unfortunately.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1rq1kikjg	2025-02-13T06:08:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/26/ByhMVq9BJx/ByhMVq9BJx_0_74_971_547_0_small.jpg

Groups that refuse to lay down their arms and submit to the defense ministry's authority will play no part in a national dialogue on Syria's future, a committee set up to prepare for a national conference said on Thursday. The statement raises the prospect of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which hold much of northern and eastern Syria, being excluded from the national conference unless they disarm in line with the demands of the new Damascus government. The seven-member preparatory committee was launched on Thursday to lay the ground for the national conference, which interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa has said will produce a statement forming the basis of a constitutional declaration. The new Syrian administration wants the U.S.-backed SDF to become part of the national armed forces but has rejected an SDF proposal for the Kurdish-led group to be merged into the army as a single military bloc.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1swoyokyl	2025-02-13T05:56:56-08:00

He made his comments following a Washington Post report that U.S. intelligence believes Israel may launch a preemptive strike on Iran’s nuclear sites in Fordow and Natanz by mid-year, aiming to exploit damage to Iranian air defenses from an IDF attack in October. 'They threaten us that they will hit nuclear facilities... If you (the enemy) strike a hundred of those we will build a thousand other ones... You can hit the buildings and the places but you cannot hit those who build it,' Pezeshkian said, according to state media. U.S. President Donald Trump raised on Monday the possibility of Israel hitting Iran in an interview with Fox News saying he would prefer to make a deal with Iran to prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon. 'Everyone thinks Israel, with our help or our approval, will go in and bomb the hell out of them. I would prefer that not to happen,' Trump said. On Thursday, the commander of Iran's conventional air force Hamid Vahedi said: 'We tell all countries, friends and foes alike, that our country's doctrine is defensive but we will respond with force against any enemy attack.' Israeli officials believe a potential attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities would have a significant impact, despite U.S. intelligence assessments suggesting it would only delay Tehran’s program by weeks or months, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian reportedly confirmed. According to American intelligence reports detailed in The Wall Street Journal, Israel is weighing two possible strike options, both of which would require U.S. support for aerial refueling, intelligence gathering and surveillance. Analysts say such reliance underscores Washington’s influence over any Israeli military action. One attack scenario involves Israeli fighter jets launching ballistic missiles from the air without entering Iranian territory, similar to October's strike. Another option would see aircraft flying over Iranian nuclear sites and deploying bunker-busting bombs, for which the Trump administration recently approved the sale of training kits. The intelligence report also suggests Israel would pressure the Trump administration to back the operation, with officials assessing that Trump is more likely to support direct U.S. involvement than his predecessor, Joe Biden. Sources familiar with the matter indicate Israel fears that its window of opportunity to halt Iran’s nuclear advancements is closing. During Trump’s initial days in office, U.S. intelligence noted that Israel was considering a strike on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. American military officials reportedly believe that given the complexity of such an operation against fortified sites, Israeli forces would likely require direct U.S. military assistance. The Wall Street Journal also cited Defense Minister Israel Katz, who in November said Iran was 'more vulnerable than ever to attacks on its nuclear facilities,' adding that Israel had 'an opportunity to achieve the most important goal: to thwart and eliminate the existential threat to the State of Israel.' Iran and Israel engaged in tit-for-tat strikes last year amid wider tensions over Israel's war in Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkatddotyg	2025-02-13T05:26:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/29/SkrjwMPRR/SkrjwMPRR_0_0_1280_853_0_small.jpg
Lookouts made to drink contaminated groundwater, Daniella was on...	In exclusive Ynet interview, Ran Gilboa calls his daughter a hero, revealing she outsmarted captors to access radio and TV, keeping informed while in Hamas captivity, Daniella still has shrapnel from wounds sustained on October 7 and requires surgery 'My daughter is a hero who returned from hell,' Daniella Gilboa's father Ran said in his first exclusive interview with Ynet after her release from captivity. 'We have a wonderful people who fight for each one of the hostages, and it is our duty to ensure they all return.' Ran, who had stayed out of the public eye during the long weeks since Daniella was abducted from her base during the Hamas massacre on October 7, said his daughter still had shrapnel in her foot and would require surgery. 'We did not know what had happened to her on October 7. The last thing we knew was that she had heard gunfire and asked us to pray for her. For two days, we had no idea if she was dead or alive. Only after her friend analyzed video footage did we learn that she was lying at the bottom of a car carrying other IDF lookouts, on her way to Gaza.' 'The terrorists shot their friends before their eyes and then separated them from the dead. They saw bodies being mutilated and other horrifying things,' he said. 'After being bound for hours, they were moved to a jeep, while we still thought they were on the base. We were naïve.' > During her time in captivity, Hamas released a video falsely depicting Daniella as dead. 'All I could see from that moment was black. Time stopped. After being held hostage for a year, enduring captivity, I thought she had been murdered. But later, we learned the clip was staged. They told her to lie down, covered her with sheets, applied makeup to her face and highlighted her tattoo. They did it on purpose, and at home, we were devastated. We were helpless.' Where was she held? 'She was kept in stifling tunnels where she couldn't stand, as well as in apartments. At one point, there was intense shelling nearby. There was no water, and Daniella and the other girls had to drink contaminated groundwater. It made her gravely ill, and for weeks, she was on death’s door. Some days, they were fed animal feed—inedible scraps of dirty vegetables and some kind of tough flour.' How were they moved around? 'She was with Karina Ariev, a close friend, the entire time. Without the terrorists realizing, she learned fluent Arabic, so they knew what was happening. At some point, Doron Steinbrecher joined them. Daniella was injured, and Doron, a veterinary nurse, dressed her wounds and helped her. All the girls had shrapnel in their bodies, and Doron cared for them as much as she could.' 'Daniella is incredibly smart and managed to manipulate her captors into letting her listen to the radio and watch Al Jazeera and i24 on TV. She saw her mother, who fought like a lioness. She said that had the girls been freed two weeks earlier, they would have looked as emaciated as the three hostages who were freed last week. Their captors gave them more food in the days leading up to their release. They were only told they would be freed three days before it happened.' When the IDF lookouts faced the Gazan crowd during their release, they smiled and held up victory signs. 'She told the girls to smile and hold their heads high. To be proud Israelis. She is an amazing girl. There are ups and downs, but she survived captivity. Now, she wants to embrace life fully. All of the hostages must be returned as quickly as possible.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjpxuxot1l	2025-02-13T05:07:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/12/yk14259391/yk14259391_0_23_851_479_0_small.jpg
Trump praises Jordan’s king amid Gaza plan: 'You are lucky to hav...	US president calls King Abdullah II 'one of the great leaders of the world' in video aimed at easing Jordanian concerns over plan to relocate Palestinians from Gaza U.S. President Donald Trump released a video on Wednesday praising Jordan’s King Abdullah II, calling him 'a tremendous man' and 'one of the true great leaders of the world.' 'You have a king who is a tremendous man. He's a leader. He's got a wonderful heart. He loves you so much, he loves his country. He's done amazingly,' Trump said in the message directed at the Jordanian people. 'You are lucky to have him.' He also commended the Jordanian people, describing them as 'a spectacular group' with 'tremendous brilliance and energy.' > The message came after Trump hosted Abdullah at the White House, where the two leaders discussed Trump’s proposal to relocate Palestinian residents of Gaza to neighboring countries while rebuilding the enclave as a tourism hub. Trump suggested U.S. financial aid to Jordan and Egypt could play a role in securing regional cooperation. 'I believe we can reach understandings,' he said. King Abdullah, for his part, said Jordan planned to take in 2,000 Palestinian children in need of medical treatment and voiced support for efforts to promote regional stability. He added, however, that further steps should wait until Egypt presented its own plan for Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1eqq4ifje	2025-02-13T04:36:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/rkW3azGjKJx/rkW3azGjKJx_0_120_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF strikes explosives-laden vehicle in Jenin, thwarts suspected ...	Troops detonate booby-trapped car, secondary explosions confirm it was rigged with explosives; in separate incident, soldiers shoot Palestinian who rammed stolen car into military base gate; military continues month-long terror sweep The IDF said Thursday it struck a vehicle packed with explosives in the eastern sector of Jenin, in the northern West Bank, as part of its ongoing counterterrorism operation. According to the IDF, the car was intended to detonate near troops operating in the area. Soldiers isolated the site and detonated the vehicle using a grenade, triggering secondary explosions that confirmed the presence of explosives inside. Shortly after, a suspected car-ramming attack was thwarted near an IDF headquarters in the northern West Bank. The military said a Palestinian suspect drove a stolen vehicle into the base's gate before exiting the car and approaching soldiers on guard. Troops responded by opening fire. > The strikes and clashes occurred as the IDF entered the 24th day of its operation targeting terror networks in and around Jenin and Tulkarm. Troops have been conducting house-to-house searches, often based on Shin Bet intelligence, in an effort to disrupt organized terrorist activity in refugee camps. Much of the fighting involves hit-and-run tactics, as terrorists avoid direct confrontation with Israeli forces. On Wednesday, a soldier was wounded in an exchange of fire in the Nur Shams refugee camp, and his comrades from the elite Maglan unit killed a terrorist in the ensuing battle. Since the start of the operation, the IDF has killed approximately 60 terrorists, arrested over 200 terror suspects, conducted 15 airstrikes and used heavy machinery to demolish buildings and roads where explosives were planted, the military said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjqxvejyyl	2025-02-13T02:27:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/rkxGudzoYJx/rkxGudzoYJx_40_200_414_233_0_small.jpg
Two Israeli Arabs charged with planning terror attacks	Suspects, 18 and 21, indicted for plotting attack on civilians and security forces while expressing support for Hamas; they conducted surveillance, attempted to obtain weapons and explored alternative attack methods Israeli security forces announced Thursday they had thwarted a planned ramming and shooting attack by two Arab Israeli citizens. The suspects, aged 18 and 21 from the village of Zemer, allegedly plotted to target civilians and security forces and expressed support for Hamas following the October 7 massacre. The two were indicted at Lod District Court on charges of conspiring to commit murder and terrorism-related offenses, including training for an attack and attempting to obtain firearms. > According to the indictment, one of the suspects began identifying with Hamas, purchased paraphernalia affiliated with the terrorist group and filmed himself expressing support. He then shared inciteful content online and suggested carrying out a shooting attack on a military transport bus near his home. His accomplice later proposed attacking civilians in the nearby city of Netanya instead. The suspects reportedly conducted surveillance of a military base, recorded videos and researched the cost of weapons. After realizing they lacked sufficient funds, they considered alternative methods, including car-ramming, firebombs or explosive devices. One suspect attempted to manufacture an explosive using online tutorials but was unsuccessful. Prosecutors have requested the suspects remain in custody throughout legal proceedings, arguing they had embraced extremist ideology and sought to maximize harm to Israeli soldiers. 'Their actions demonstrate clear intent to carry out a serious attack,' the prosecution said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy002qsoykx	2025-02-13T02:12:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/04/06/SJ5Zxt2W2/SJ5Zxt2W2_1_89_1000_563_0_small.jpg

Hamas confirms hostage release to proceed under cease-fire agreem...	Terror group reaffirms commitment to Gaza truce and Saturday’s hostage release; heavy machinery and caravans bound for Gaza; Netanyahu's office denies reports Israel agreed to allow heavy machinery into enclave Hamas has reaffirmed its commitment to the Gaza cease-fire agreement and the scheduled release of hostages on Saturday, three days after it unilaterally suspended the deal citing alleged Israeli violations, Palestinian sources told Arabic media on Thursday. The terrorist group has conditioned the next phase of hostage releases on Israel ensuring the continued flow of humanitarian aid beyond Saturday. The statement comes after footage surfaced showing dozens of caravans waiting to enter the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing, along with numerous tractors—aligned with Hamas' demand to allow heavy equipment for clearing debris. However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office denied reports that Israel had agreed to allow heavy machinery into Gaza. Defense Minister Israel Katz said Thursday that the government remains committed to securing the release of all hostages. 'Our top priority is the release of the hostages. We will not blink, and we will not back down,' Katz said at a tree-planting ceremony marking the establishment of a new neighborhood in the southern city of Arad. 'From here, I am heading to another meeting with all IDF command units, where the prime minister will also participate. We are preparing to act with full force. If the hostages are not released, we will respond with strength in Gaza and wherever necessary.' The Israeli National Public Diplomacy Directorate issued a directive to government ministers reinforcing the country’s stance on the hostage deal. The directive stated that 'the cease-fire in Gaza is conditional on the deal’s implementation: If Hamas does not release hostages by Saturday afternoon, the IDF will resume intense military operations.' Israeli officials reiterated that Hamas must uphold its commitments under the cease-fire agreement but did not specify how many hostages are expected to be freed in the upcoming phase. The directive also condemned Hamas for its treatment of hostages, saying the recently released captives exhibited signs of severe mistreatment. 'The condition of the three hostages freed last Saturday highlights the inhumane conditions in which they were held and the unbearable cruelty of Hamas,' the statement read. 'Israel takes these disturbing images seriously, recalling dark periods in history, and will not let this stand.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to Israeli estimates, 76 hostages remain in Gaza, both alive and deceased. 'The State of Israel has a moral and ethical obligation to bring them all home—every last one,' the statement concluded. The announcement follows a call from U.S. President Donald Trump demanding the immediate release of all remaining hostages, warning that those still in captivity 'do not have much time left.' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio reinforced Trump's stance, saying, 'If Hamas fails to uphold the agreement on Saturday, we will return to the situation we were in months ago—Hamas will be destroyed, and Israeli forces will move in to resolve the issue.' Egyptian intelligence chief Hassan Rashad held talks with a Hamas delegation in Cairo on Wednesday. According to the Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, the meeting was described as 'positive,' with both sides reaching an understanding on humanitarian aid provisions necessary to facilitate the completion of the deal. A similar report aired on Egypt’s Al-Ghad channel overnight, claiming Egyptian mediation had brought Hamas and Israel closer to resolving outstanding issues. The report said Hamas confirmed its commitment to the deal, and an agreement was reached to allow additional aid into Gaza, including caravans for displaced residents. The number of aid trucks entering northern Gaza is also expected to increase. Hamas-affiliated Quds Network reported that 801 aid trucks entered Gaza on Wednesday, marking the highest single-day delivery since the cease-fire began. Of those, 231 trucks were directed to northern Gaza, including 139 via the Erez crossing and 92 through Zikim, while the remaining 570 entered through the Kerem Shalom crossing. Under the cease-fire agreement, Israel had committed to allowing 600 aid trucks per day into Gaza, meaning Wednesday’s deliveries exceeded the quota by 201 trucks. Hamas previously claimed that Israeli delays in permitting the entry of shelters, tents, and caravans for displaced Palestinians were among the reasons it temporarily halted the hostage deal. An Egyptian official said Wednesday that the parties were 'close to an agreement' and that Israel had committed to increasing the supply of tents, shelters, and heavy equipment into Gaza. New images released Thursday showed dozens of caravans and tractors waiting at the Rafah crossing, pending approval to enter. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h12owhofkl	2025-02-13T01:42:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/HJlaZrrt1g/HJlaZrrt1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

A widespread malfunction in Israel’s national payment system disrupted transactions across the country on Thursday, forcing many businesses to request cash-only payments. The issue was reported by Automated Bank Services (Shva), the company responsible for Israel’s automated banking and payment infrastructure. 'Our professional teams are investigating the cause of the failure,' the company said in a statement. This is not the first disruption to affect Israel’s payment processing networks. In November, a malfunction at Credit Guard, a clearing service provider for major retail chains, caused widespread payment issues. A month earlier, a Shva system failure impacted businesses relying on servers abroad. Cybersecurity concerns have also played a role in past disruptions. Over the past year, several payment system failures have been linked to cyberattacks, raising questions about the resilience of Israel’s financial infrastructure. Authorities have yet to determine whether the current outage is related to a cyber threat.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1kkjsjfkl	2025-02-13T00:47:39-08:00	
New class of lookouts at Nahal Oz base fight through grief, remem...	Capt. Shahar Azran recognized freed hostages Liri Albag and Naama Levy as her former trainees, abducted from Nahal Oz on October 7; now stationed at Re’im base, she and fellow IDF lookouts continue their mission while mourning fallen comrades and supporting survivors 'These are my girls!' declared Capt. Shahar Azran, 25, of the Northern Brigade’s lookout trainees as she viewed the first footage of Liri Albag and Naama Levy, who were abducted from the Nahal Oz post on October 7. Just two days earlier, alongside Agam Berger, the late Noa Marciano, and the late Shirat Yam Amar, she had awarded them their course completion pins. Even before the full situation was clear, Shahar—with six years of experience on the front—recognized its gravity and headed toward the division base. 'It was hard, but I felt I was needed here, with my experience, knowledge, and support,' she explained. 'The girls were coping with the loss of friends who had been killed or abducted. I, too, lost people along the way, including Capt. Shir Eilat, the operations room officer, and Col. Asaf Hamami, my brigade commander.' After the Nahal Oz operations room was moved to the Re’im base and the lookout trainees subsequently received personal weapons, what happened that morning continues to haunt everyone. 'We deal with it every day, tending to them with the utmost care and consulting professionals,' said Shahar. 'We mainly remind the girls that we are here for them—we listen and embrace them.' The return of the five lookout trainees who had been held captive brought a sense of closure for Shahar. 'I'm being discharged in three weeks, and I knew it would be very hard to be released knowing they were still captive,' she said. 'When they returned, a weight was lifted from our hearts. Still, we didn't know in what condition they'd come back, and we were sensitive about the friends who remain in service. I told them it wasn’t easy for me either—being responsible for signing their training certificates and assigning them to the Nahal Oz base—leaving me wondering if I could have done something differently.' At the massacre at the Nahal Oz base, 15 lookout trainees were killed, and Marciano was abducted and murdered in Hamas captivity. 'We continue the legacy of those we've lost in their spirit,' said Shahar. 'We commemorate their birthdays and share the stories of who they were. On the last Memorial Day, we embarked on a tour in the periphery, stopping at 16 sites—each dedicated to a fallen comrade. Alongside that, we choose to rise again.' In the new operations room at the Re’im base, Cpl. Maayan Monsongo, 19, and Sgt. Maayan Shimon, 20, sit absorbed in their screens, never taking their eyes off the front they oversee. Joining them is Pvt. Talia Ashram, 18, the niece of Shay Ashram, who was murdered in the operations room on October 7. That morning, Cpl. Shimon—who had been in training with Uri Megidish, Marciano, Hadar Cohen, and Mia Vialovo, who was at home reading frantic messages from her comrades—recalled, 'I heard gunshots, there was an assault, they were at our post; I heard screams in Arabic.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The girls who didn’t observe the Sabbath set up their own makeshift operations room and tried to gather information about their friends—who was where, how each was faring, and what was occurring at the base, their second home. 'At first, my mind couldn’t process it; I refused to believe these were the girls I knew,' said Shimon. Reflecting on the first shift after that Sabbath, amid news of friends being killed or abducted, she recalled, 'We understood each other only through glances. We didn’t speak much—it was still hard to process. One moment we could be joyful, and the next, tearful. It’s hard to know that your friends performed their duty, even while reporting on terrorist infiltrations, and yet there were those who disrespected them.' Cpl. Monsongo, 19, from Jerusalem, joined the operations room a few days after the war broke out. 'I was driven to come here. For me, it's an honor to continue the path of those who fought for us,' she said. Having served in the original operations room near the Gaza Strip border, she added, 'We saw the front with our own eyes, met the residents we defended. It profoundly influenced our role.' Sgt. Shimon also recalled the old operations room: 'It used to be a cheerful, bright place. The photos after October 7—burnt and gray—are a far cry from how we remembered it.' One cherished tradition was 'tea time,' a Friday meal that stretched throughout the day, culminating in the evening when the lookout trainees gathered around a table to sing songs about the operations room. 'We stood out in the landscape,' they described themselves. 'It’s hard to miss us, in a good way.' The latest to join the operations room is Pvt. Talia Ashram, 18, from Rehovot, assigned after the loss of her cousin and close friend, Shay Ashram. Initially, when she received her assignment, she considered refusing, but when she realized the date coincided with the day Shay was taken for burial, she saw it as a sign. At the end of her course, she requested to serve in the same operations room where Shay had worked, and today she occupies her position, keeping watch over a front she knows better than anyone. 'It’s both moving and nerve-racking,' she explains. 'The role is not easy, but it carries a deep sense of mission and meaning. I waited for the moment when I could sit in Shay’s position and feel complete. Here, I feel she is with me, watching over me. I am here to stay, relying on myself and the army. They might break our hearts, but they cannot break who we are or the people of Israel—we are stronger than anything.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyfv3f5tkg	2025-02-13T00:34:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/11/S1N239MKKye/S1N239MKKye_62_127_1054_593_0_small.jpg

Russian drones hit Ukraine port, Moldova says drones exploded on ...	Russian drone attacks damaged port infrastructure in southern Ukraine, officials said on Thursday, while neighboring Moldova said two drones had blown up on its soil and NATO member Romania said its airspace had likely been breached. Kyiv said Moscow attacked Ukraine with 140 drones overnight, injuring one person in the Izmail district of Ukraine's Odesa region which lies on the Danube River and borders Romania and Moldova. Photos shared by the emergency services showed rescuers putting out a fire at the site of an attack, without specifying exactly where.

Assad's son in first comments from Moscow: 'We didn't plan to fle...	After the overthrow of his regime, Bashar Assad and his family fled to the Russian capital and have been staying there in complete secrecy ever since; his son Hafez shares about the escape and the moments leading up to it Information about the refuge of the ousted Assads in Russia is shrouded under complete secrecy. The media is not covering it at all; they are apparently following instructions above. Meanwhile, the new leadership in Syria is demanding the extradition of the dictator who massacred his people. A short video uploaded by Hafez, Assad's eldest son, circulating on social networks has followers trying to geolocate where exactly he is on the streets of Moscow. In the video, Assad Jr. sought to clarify that the accounts in his name on X and Telegram are indeed his. These are the accounts in which he published information in recent days about the last moments before the fall of his father's regime and the family's escape to Moscow, but X removed the long and detailed post in less than an hour and closed the account without an official response. In a video published online on Wednesday, Assad is seen walking in an upscale Moscow neighborhood and clarifying: 'There were questions about the accounts on X and Telegram, and whether they belong to me. I wanted to clarify that they do belong to me and I have no other accounts on any other platform. Hello.' The new video sparked several reactions on social media. This is the younger Assad's first appearance from Moscow, and some users have tried to geolocate where it was filmed and posted possible landmarks on X. Some users claimed that Assad revealed his personal information on Telegram without noticing, but these were not verified. On his Telegram and now-blocked X accounts, Assad described the moments before the family fled Syria. 'There was no plan to leave Damascus, let alone Syria,' he claimed. Assad, whose father had massacred hundreds of thousands of his own people through the course of the war, said: 'Over the past 14 years, Syria has gone through circumstances no less difficult than those that occurred in late November and early December.' Assad said that he had come back to Moscow to complete his doctoral dissertation shortly before the rebel blitz attack that led to the collapse of the regime of his father. Meanwhile, his mother Asma, who is battling leukemia, was in the Russian capital at the time for a bone marrow transplant. He said he had planned to stay in the city to complete paperwork for his degree but returned to Damascus on December 1 due to the worsening situation in Syria. His mother remained in Moscow for treatment, with his sister, Zain Assad, staying by her side. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Assad wrote that on December 7-8, as opposition forces completed their takeover of Syria’s main cities, including Damascus, he was still in the country. He claimed that when rumors spread about his family fleeing, he took and published a photo of himself in a local park to refute them. According to him, there were no signs of preparation for their departure until a 'Russian official' arrived at their home, requesting that President Assad relocate to Latakia, home to a key Russian military base in Syria. 'We left for Damascus International Airport around 3 a.m. and met my uncle, Maher Assad, there,' he wrote, referring to the commander of the Syrian army’s Fourth Division, which was involved in managing the Captagon trade. 'The airport was empty, including the control tower,' he added. 'We then boarded a Russian military plane to Latakia, landing at Khmeimim Airport before dawn.' It was only that day, December 8, that they realized they would have to leave for Russia. His full post detailing the last moments in Syria remains available on a Telegram account linked to him. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1vvnqjyjl	2025-02-12T23:42:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/BJRqi6qK1e/BJRqi6qK1e_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg
Hamas willing to release three hostages on Saturday, report says	Terror group yet to issue official statement, but Arabic media report it informed mediators that Saturday's hostage release will proceed amid increased aid deliveries to Gaza Three days after Hamas unilaterally froze the hostage deal, citing alleged Israeli violations, Palestinian sources told Arabic media Thursday that the terrorist group has reaffirmed its commitment to the agreement and plans to proceed with the next hostage release on Saturday. However, Hamas has conditioned the release on Israel ensuring the continued flow of humanitarian aid beyond Saturday. Despite this demand, mediators believe the crisis has effectively been resolved. The reports follow a call from U.S. President Donald Trump for the immediate release of 'all hostages,' warning that those still in captivity 'do not have much time left.' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio reinforced Trump’s stance, saying Wednesday, 'If Hamas fails to uphold the agreement on Saturday, we will return to the situation we were in months ago—Hamas will be destroyed, and Israeli forces will move in to resolve the issue.' Speaking to Fox News and NewsNation, Rubio accused Hamas of violating the agreement. 'Hamas is in breach. They are at fault,' he said. 'The president is fed up with this trickle of hostage releases—he wants people out now. We saw the condition of those freed last week—they were on the brink of death. They looked terrible, and the president has had enough.' Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar cited sources describing Wednesday’s meeting in Cairo between Egyptian intelligence chief Hassan Rashad and a Hamas delegation as 'positive.' The report said agreements were reached to facilitate the deal’s completion, with a focus on humanitarian aid commitments. According to the sources, Egypt proposed a compromise ensuring partial implementation of the humanitarian aid provisions rather than full compliance. 'Everything now depends on Israel’s response to the Egyptian proposal,' the report said. A similar report aired on Egypt’s Al Ghad channel overnight, claiming Cairo had bridged gaps between Hamas and Israel, paving the way for the scheduled hostage release on Saturday. The report said Hamas confirmed its commitment to the deal, and an agreement was reached to allow more aid into Gaza, including caravans for displaced residents. Additionally, the number of aid trucks permitted to enter northern Gaza is set to increase. > Hamas-affiliated Quds Network also reported that the 801 trucks that entered Gaza on Wednesday marked the highest number of aid deliveries since the cease-fire began. According to the report, 231 trucks were directed to northern Gaza, including 139 via the Erez crossing and 92 through Zikim, while the remaining 570 entered through the Kerem Shalom crossing. Under the terms of the agreement, Israel had committed to allowing 600 aid trucks per day into Gaza, meaning Wednesday’s deliveries exceeded that quota by 201 trucks. Hamas has previously claimed that Israeli delays in allowing shelters, tents and caravans for displaced Palestinians were among the reasons it temporarily halted the hostage deal. An Egyptian official said Wednesday that the parties were 'close to an agreement' and that Israel had committed to increasing the delivery of tents, shelters and heavy equipment into Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkufqfjtje	2025-02-12T23:06:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/04/r1gyNt1K1x/r1gyNt1K1x_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Israel to deport 3 Jerusalem residents for supporting terror	Interior Minister says those who praise terrorism 'have no place among us'; says he is using new legislation to exercise his authority because the three chose to stand with Israel's enemies in time of war Interior Minister Moshe Arbel said on Wednesday that he intends to exercise his legal authority to deport three Palestsinian residents of east Jerusalem accused of supporting terrorism, pending a hearing. Tasneem Oudeh, Mohammed Abu Helwa, and Zina Barbar are alleged to have expressed support for terrorist organizations and incited violence. Explaining his decision, Arbel told Ynet: 'I have decided to exercise my legal authority to deport three terror supporters—relatives of terrorists—who chose to stand with the enemy during wartime and support attacks on Israeli civilians. Those who incite, praise, and support terrorism have no place among us. I will continue to act decisively against anyone who threatens the safety of Israeli citizens.' In a letter outlining the case against Oudeh, Arbel cited multiple instances of pro-terror activities over the past three years. In one incident, in October 2022, she was arrested alongside her mother at the Temple Mount while wearing a necklace featuring the image of terrorist Ibrahim Nabulsi. In 2024, she allegedly distributed propaganda materials online. Oudeh is the daughter of Barakat Oudeh, who carried out a car-ramming attack on Route 1 on October 30, 2022, injuring five Israeli soldiers. Arbel also informed Abu Helwa, a convicted prisoner, that he is considering his deportation due to his affiliation with Hamas. The minister noted that Abu Helwa was indicted in August 2023 for incitement and supporting a terrorist group. He also hinted that the decision was influenced by the fact that Abu Helwa’s brother carried out a terrorist attack in Israel in October 2023.

Israel seen as likely to attack Iran by midyear, report	Joint Chiefs and DNI report says attacks likely on Fordow, Natanz nuclear facilities; White House National Security Spokesperson says Trump 'prefers negotiating a resolution' but will not wait indefinitely if Iran is not willing to deal U.S. intelligence warns that Israel is likely to launch a preemptive attack on Iran's nuclear program by midyear, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday, citing multiple intelligence reports. Such an attack would set back Iran's nuclear program by weeks or months while escalating tension in the region and risking a wider conflict, according to multiple intelligence reports from the end of the Biden administration and start of the Trump administration, the newspaper reported. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. The White House declined to comment. The Post said the Israeli government, CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency and Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, told the Post that President Donald Trump 'will not permit Iran to get a nuclear weapon.' 'While he prefers negotiating a resolution to American's long-standing issues with the Iranian regime peacefully, he will not wait indefinitely if Iran isn't willing to deal, and soon,' Hughes told The Post. The most comprehensive of the intelligence reports came in early January and was produced by the intelligence directorate of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Post said. It warned that Israel was likely to attempt an attack on Iran's Fordow and Natanz nuclear facilities. Current and former U.S. officials familiar with the intelligence said Israel has determined its bombing of Iran in October degraded Iran's air defenses and left the country exposed to a follow-on assault, said the Post, which did not name the officials. Iran and Israel engaged in tit-for-tat strikes last year amid wider tensions over Israel's war in Gaza. The intelligence reports envisioned two potential strike options that each would involve the United States providing aerial refueling support and intelligence, the Post said. Trump told Fox News in an interview that aired on Monday he would prefer to make a deal with Iran to prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon, saying he also believed Iran would prefer a deal over an armed conflict. > 'Everyone thinks Israel, with our help or our approval, will go in and bomb the hell out of them. I would prefer that not happen,' Trump said. The United States under President Barack Obama and European allies negotiated an agreement with Iran to halt its nuclear program, but Trump in his first term in office, encouraged by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, withdrew the United States from the landmark accord and ordered sanctions reimposed on Tehran in 2018. Iran has since restarted its nuclear program and is enriching uranium, according to the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryxaixofjx	2025-02-12T19:53:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/04/18/r1NKX5RxA/r1NKX5RxA_277_0_1885_1061_0_small.jpg

Is the Palestinian Authority really cancelling pay-for-slay payme...	According to Itamar Marcus, founder of Palestinian Media Watch, the PA has made it clear that it is on the verge of total financial collapse Is the Palestinian Authority (PA) truly ending its controversial pay-for-slay program? According to Itamar Marcus, founder of Palestinian Media Watch, the PA has made it clear that it is on the verge of total financial collapse. 'They've said they've loaned billions from their own banks, and they can't loan anymore. They've reached a maximum,' Marcus said. 'The only way they can survive is if Israel stops deducting tax transfers and if the United States and other countries start funding them again.' However, the U.S. cannot provide funds to Hamas due to the Taylor Force Act, which prohibits payments to any individual or organization that supports terrorism. As a result, in order to receive U.S. funding, the PA would have to repeal its pay-for-slay law. At the same time, Marcus explained that for the past 15 years, the Palestinian public has been told that nothing would ever threaten the salaries of terrorists in prison. 'What we're seeing today is that [President Mahmoud Abbas] has canceled the old law. He said that the prisoners and the martyrs’ families will continue to get funding from a new framework,' Marcus said. 'The language he used is intentionally ambiguous so that the families of the terrorists can imagine and believe that they’re going to get the same amount. And the Americans, if they want to, can believe that it’s going to be a normal welfare amount.' But there is a significant difference. 'A Palestinian terrorist who was a murderer and is in jail for 30 years—his family is receiving 12,000 shekels a month, whereas the highest welfare payments are 600 shekels a month,' Marcus said. 'So if Abbas really follows through and replaces these payments with standard welfare, there is going to be a lot of noise and a lot of anger in the Palestinian Authority,' Marcus added. 'We will know very soon what’s really happening based on how the families and the population respond.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ibyjiyyx	2025-02-12T17:58:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/24/B19009FBz6/B19009FBz6_0_111_1300_732_0_small.jpg
How a historic Six-Day War battlefield is keeping the legacy of I...	The 'Adopt a Liberator' initiative aims to preserve and honor the legacy of those who fought for Jerusalem’s reunification while creating an inspiring educational asset for future generations ILTV was joined in the studio by Alon Wald, head of operations for Ammunition Hill, the historic battle site from the Six-Day War that is being transformed into a modern educational center. Wald discussed an exciting initiative called 'Adopt a Liberator,' supported by Jewish National Fund-USA. This initiative aims to preserve and honor the legacy of those who fought for Jerusalem’s reunification while creating an inspiring educational asset for future generations. ILTV: Why is Ammunition Hill important for telling this story and preserving the legacy? Wald: Ammunition Hill is a battlefield intact, exactly as it was 57 years ago when the paratroopers of the IDF stormed inside, facing one of the toughest battles the paratroopers ever faced during the 77 years of our existence. Against all odds, outnumbered, with no artillery support, no intelligence, no aerial support, they came out victorious, and it's considered to be the pivotal battle that paved the way for the reunification of Jerusalem. The bereaved families decided not to allow it to be demolished, and it evolved to become an educational asset. ILTV: Tell us about the brave individuals who fought on Ammunition Hill and how this initiative is honoring their legacy. Wald: They are part of an amazing generation. They fought, they won, they united Jerusalem. But as far as we are concerned, they became our adopted fathers. This amazing generation literally adopted us, the kids of Ammunition Hill. I lost my father there, 57 years ago, without being asked, when all of the nation was marveling at the reunification of Jerusalem, they reached out to our mothers, to our families, making a vow that lasted. Today, I lost my father, but I have gained 10 amazing idol figures. All through the years, they gave us the core values they stood for, not only as soldiers, but as human beings. We are losing them on a yearly basis. So we decided to reach out over the last four years, with the blessing and the support of Jewish National Fund-USA, urging students all over Israel to adopt a liberator that lives in their proximity. Three of these liberators are members of the kibbutz movement in the Gaza envelope. They were supposed to be involved in this initiative soon after Sukkot, on October 23. But they were abducted, and the kids waited for them for more than a year. Eventually, all three of them—liberators of Jerusalem, brave fighters, warriors—lost their lives in the tunnels where they were murdered by Hamas. Normally, we adopt a liberator, but in their absence, we decided not to give up and to preserve the legacy. With the widows, with the family members, the kids are deeply engaged in this project, and it's unbelievable because they are able to study their past, be engaged, and be committed. They will help us preserve the legacy of these amazing grandfathers who lost their lives. We owe them so much. Even as we speak, these kids are recording their memories, the memories of the families, and scanning everything the families give them. Eventually, everything will be brought back to Ammunition Hill for eternal preservation. ILTV: How can others get involved? Wald: Reach out to Ammunition Hill. Every high school principal can choose one class. We have enough. We have sufficient funds from JNF-USA because they realize that what we do means so much to these kids who study their past. We will give them everything they need to preserve the legacy of a local talent, a local grandfather. ILTV: What is your long-term vision for preserving the site? Wald: We're talking about preserving the legacy. The widest common denominator of core values will stand for bravery, leadership, and courage. These are values that we can share with kids and tell them: you can be brave tomorrow morning without sacrificing your life, without going to any war.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjjzcaqtyl	2025-02-12T17:38:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/ByklsR5Y1x/ByklsR5Y1x_0_33_1600_901_0_small.jpg
Delegation of Brazilian officials tours Israel amid rising global...	The diplomats visited locations related to the October 7 attacks, including the Nova Music Festival memorial site, hard-hit kibbutzim in the south, and Yad Vashem In an incredible display of solidarity, a group of Brazilian diplomats and congress members visited Israel as part of a delegation organized by Nechama and Hatzalah. The mission of this delegation was to bolster advocacy against antisemitism and strengthen the bond between Israel and the diaspora. Led by Nechama and Hatzalah’s chairman, Moshiko Moskowitz, and Brazilian philanthropist Mrs. Alessandra Safra, the delegation embarked on a meaningful journey, engaging in discussions on profoundly relevant topics while touring significant sites.

In addition, the delegation toured Israel’s Knesset and met with Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana. Amid growing global concerns about antisemitism, Nechama and Hatzalah took a break from their many charitable activities in Israel—such as caring for evacuees and supporting soldiers on the battlefield—to focus on strengthening ties between Israel and the diaspora.

Hamas will not free all hostages now, calls for world-wide marche...	Senior Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri says Trump's threats mean nothing and do not scare them, and that they are committed to deal as it was agreed Hamas on Wednesday said it would not release all of the Israeli hostages on Saturday and called for three days of solidarity marches around the world in protest of U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to remove Palestinians from Gaza in order to rebuild it. 'We call our masses, our nation, and free people around the world in a global movement against the plans to uproot our Palestinian people, in the coming Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to march against the plan of the occupation and its supporters,' Hamas said in a statement. Senior spokesman for Hamas Sami Abu Zuhri told Al Jazeera the terror group had no intention of releasing all of the hostages on Saturday. 'Trump's announcement created tension and led to Israel avoiding its commitments to the deal,' he said adding that threats of a renewed war in Gaza if the hostages were not freed, made by Defense Minister Israel Katz were silly and banal. 'Trump's threats mean nothing and do not scare us,' he said. 'Egypt and Qatar are making great efforts to push Israel to meet its obligations and we are pleased with the official position of Arab states who reject the plan to uproot Palestinians. The administration of Gaza is a Palestinian affair and we will not be dictated to. We are committed to the deal as it was agreed and will not be releasing all of the prisoners next Saturday.'

Another senior Hamas official said 'positive signals' had been received, while an Egyptian source stated that the parties were 'close to an agreement.'

Message from captivity provides renewed optimism for Eitan Mor's ...	After receiving a sign of life from his son Father Tzvika Mor recounts silence and missed opportunities, as released hostages now provide updates on their loved ones’ conditions A sign of life from an additional captive—not included on the list scheduled for release in the first phase of the hostage deal—has been received from captive Eitan Mor hours after his father told ynet in an interview that he had been given no new information about his son's condition from hostages that were released. 'We should have blown up the deal at the first breach,' Mor said. It seems to me that on Saturday the three hostages will be released; then will Israel break the deal? No. I think Hamas does not want to get too entangled with Trump—they’re driving us crazy, and in the end, they will do what is necessary.' Mor said an opportunity was lost. 'We should have shown Hamas that we are not suckers. Shut off the water, the trucks—everything—and Hamas would have chased after us. But we did not do that. We delayed and waited for the uncle from America to tell us what needed to be done—and in doing so, we lost our authority here.' Earlier on Wednesday evening, Hagai Angerst, the father of the captured soldier Matan Angerst, said that his family received a sign of life from him through hostages who were released in the most recent rounds. Reports that an armored soldier is alive—but is being held injured under harsh conditions—were received half a year after he was seen in a psychological terror video found in Gaza. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In a Ynet studio broadcast on Wednesday morning, the aunt of hostage Yosef Haim Ohana reported for the first time that a sign of life was also received from him. 'We have clear evidence that he is alive,' said Aunt Hana Mastorov. 'There are signs of life indicating that he is alive.' Since the massacre on October, families of hostages have tended to hide receiving signs of life from their loved ones—mainly due to requests from security officials who believed that revealing such information might endanger those held in captivity. Even the documentation with signs of life published by Hamas, seemingly dictated to the hostages as to what to say, was not always made public at the request of the families. However, since the beginning of the current deal, a little over three weeks ago, several families have received updates with signs of life from hostages still held by Hamas—understanding that only in this way can they hope to bring everyone home. Unlike the Hamas documentation that included signs of life, this time the updates came through hostages released as part of the deal, who shared with their families information about the condition of their loved ones in captivity. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1ep2uqt1e	2025-02-12T13:04:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/16/SJnMLS5Za/SJnMLS5Za_2_20_319_180_0_small.jpg

We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations,' Trump said in his Truth Social post. He added that he and Putin agreed to work closely together, including reciprocal visits. Trump concluded by noting that millions have already perished in a war that never should have started if a proper leader had been in charge from the beginning—'but it did happen, so it must end. No more lives should be lost!' He expressed his gratitude to President Putin for his time and effort during the call and for yesterday securing the release of American prisoner Mark Fogel. 'I believe this initiative will lead to a successful conclusion, and I hope it happens very soon,' he wrote. Trump then called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. 'The conversation went very well. He, like President Putin, wants to make peace.' Trump said after the call. 'It’s time to end this absurd war, which has caused enormous and entirely unnecessary death and destruction. May God bless the Russians and the Ukrainians!' Zelensky described his conversation with Trump as 'highly significant' and said that the American president updated him on his call with Putin, noting, 'We discussed opportunities for peace and agreed to maintain contact and schedule further meetings.' Trump's conversation with Putin came one day after Moscow unexpectedly released American prisoner Marc Fogel from a Russian jail, allowing him to return to the United States with Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. The surprising deal was reached following secret negotiations conducted by Witkoff on Trump’s behalf and was seen as a signal of Putin’s desire to rebuild trust with the United States and reach agreements. National Security Advisor Mike Wallace said last night that the prisoner swap was 'a demonstration of goodwill on the part of the Russians and a sign that we are moving in the right direction toward ending the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine.' Fogel, 63—a history teacher—was arrested in Russia in 2021 on drug charges after entering the country with medical marijuana. In 2023, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Initially, the Biden administration refrained from describing Fogel as having been wrongfully detained, thereby marking him as a candidate for a prisoner exchange like other American detainees; later, he was designated as such, and ultimately, the Trump administration completed the deal. It was also revealed on Wednesday that in exchange for Fogel’s release, the United States freed a Russian citizen named Alexander Vinnik, head of a cybercrime network, who was arrested in Greece in 2017 and subsequently extradited to U.S. authorities. In May last year, Vinnik pleaded guilty and was convicted in connection with money laundering. U.S. authorities claim that Vinik operated cryptocurrency exchange services, allegedly transferring around $4 billion derived from ransomware attacks, identity theft, drug trafficking, and other criminal activities.

During his campaign, Trump had promised that if elected he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine 'within 24 hours.' He and many Republicans have criticized the enormous sums Washington pays in military aid to Kyiv as wasteful, suggesting that Ukraine might have to make painful concessions, including relinquishing vast territories captured over the past 11 years by Putin’s forces. In an interview with Fox News earlier this week, Trump even entertained the possibility that Ukraine might one day rejoin Russia, echoing the days of the Soviet Union. In a meeting with senior NATO officials in Brussels on Wednesday, Trump’s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declared that while the United States aims to see Ukraine continue as an independent state, its accession to NATO—an idea that was among Putin’s justifications for his deep invasion of Ukraine in February 2022—is an 'unrealistic aspiration.' Hegseth further asserted that the goal of Ukraine’s supporters to reclaim all territories lost since 2014 is 'an illusion,' sending a clear signal to Kyiv that the Trump administration would not support Zelensky’s demand that Moscow return all the lands it captured, which comprise roughly one-fifth of Ukraine’s territory. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h12d0000ctje	2025-02-12T11:04:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/27/S1UteWSmyx/S1UteWSmyx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Hamas calls for marches around the world in opposition to Trump's...	Hamas on Wednesday called for supporters around the world to march in opposition to the plan announced by U.S. President Donald Trump to remove Palestinians from Gaza while he rebuilds the Strip. 'We call our masses, our nation and free people around the world in a global movement against the plans to uproot our Palestinian people, in the coming Friday, Saturday and Sunday to march against the plan of the occupation and its supporters,' Hamas said in a statement.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r19nwuqfkl	2025-02-12T10:36:52-08:00	
I wasn’t fired because I was a bad defense minister'	Former defense minister Yoav Gallant breaks his silence, accusing politicians of leaking classified details to derail hostage deal talks with Hamas. He defends his handling of the war in the face of an international arrest warrant against him. 'I am proud to be accused of defending the State of Israel': part two of the full interview Part Three 'I wasn’t fired because I was a bad defense minister' The hostages, Gaza’s future, the destruction of the Strip As defense minister, Gallant maintained constant contact with the families of the hostages. He watches the release of the hostages in the latest deal on television. 'I followed it with deep emotion. It was incredibly moving for me. From the very beginning of the war, I made a tremendous effort to ensure that the female soldiers were first classified as women, and only then as soldiers.' This deal was essentially the same one the security establishment had put forward in the spring of 2024. Its core remained unchanged: there was no commitment to halting the war, only a partial release, and Israel would withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor. 'This formula was presented in April. It was discussed in a War Cabinet meeting where a unanimous decision was made. A mandate was given to shape the negotiations: the deal aimed for the release of 33 hostages but could go as low as 18 as a minimum threshold. There was complete consensus among the security establishment and all the ministers. The prime minister accepted it. This was midday, during Passover, 2023.' Then, something highly unusual happened. 'A few hours later, in the evening, a full Cabinet meeting was held. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich came in and said, ‘If there’s a deal for 18, we will leave the government.’ He wasn’t even supposed to know about it. The ministers had no idea what he was talking about.' Gallant is making a remarkable accusation. The gravity of this moment is crucial. Israel had set a confidential minimum position for negotiations: no deal would proceed without at least 18 hostages being released. This was a state secret—no one was supposed to know it, for obvious reasons, to prevent Hamas from using it as their final demand. Yet within hours of this minimum number being set in a closed forum, it was leaked to the finance minister, who then declared it openly in a full Cabinet meeting. Effectively the equivalent of announcing it on the Knesset floor. 'A few hours later, the number 18 was published in the media. This happened in the middle of negotiations between Shin Bet representatives and the Egyptians. I received reports that, following our decision regarding the Netzarim Corridor and the 33-hostage target, the Egyptians said there was a breakthrough, and progress was possible. A day or two later, we got word that Hamas told the mediators: ‘They’re talking to us about 33, but the Israeli media reported 18—so why agree to 33 when we can get a deal for less?’ And the whole deal fell apart. The next time it was revived was at the end of May, in President Biden’s speech.' But what happened with this leak? 'I don’t know.' Have you spoken to the prime minister about this? 'Yes. I don’t want to elaborate.' Gallant may not want to elaborate, but reports indicate that Netanyahu called him, shaken—whether genuinely or not is debated—and informed him that 'everything was ruined' now that the details had leaked to the media. As a result, Netanyahu claimed, the negotiation team’s mandate would have to be revised. Gallant responded by demanding that Benny Gantz be brought onto the call, making it clear that if Netanyahu was backtracking, the issue would need to be brought back to a vote in the War Cabinet. Netanyahu backed down. The security establishment suspected that Netanyahu’s own people had leaked the minimum threshold to Smotrich to sabotage the deal. Washington believed the same. 'This deal could have been completed even after Biden’s speech. On July 3, Hamas accepted the deal reached. I told the hostage families: ‘The conditions are in place.’ And I believe the conditions were already in place at that point. But we didn’t respond to Hamas. In fact, we didn’t respond at all until July 28. On that day, the issue of the Philadelphi Corridor was added (as an Israeli condition). I told Netanyahu: ‘If Hamas has given us a positive answer, and we’re about to respond with a rejection, at least send the response the next day. Why waste three weeks? Why drag this out? We need to move fast.’ 'In reality, we could have secured the same deal with more hostages at a lower cost. An additional 110 prisoners sentenced to life were later included—who were not even part of the discussions at that time. What you see today is essentially the same as what was on the table in July.' 'Every draft year, a quarter of Jewish 18-year-olds—25%—are ultra-Orthodox. One in four. We cannot afford not to draft them, or at least the vast majority of them. That is what I fought for, because of the war. This is no longer just a social necessity; it has become a national necessity. And on top of that, there was no legislation in place for exempting them. Now, that’s the principle of the matter. As for why I was fired—ask the prime minister. But I can tell you for certain: I wasn’t fired because I was a bad defense minister.' Meanwhile, hostages died. Why didn’t this deal happen? 'It was explicitly stated—by Smotrich and Ben-Gvir. They dragged the Cabinet in their direction. And in my view, that was a mistake. I remind you that in August, there was a vote on the Philadelphi Corridor (making Israel's presence there a condition to any deal, n.e), and I was in the minority. I voted against making it a condition, while everyone else voted in favor. I told them: ‘Either go back to my proposal, or we will lose the hostages.’' What you’re saying is serious. You’re saying that hostages died because of political maneuvering by Smotrich, Ben-Gvir and Netanyahu’s capitulation to them. 'You can draw your own conclusions. I am telling you as clearly as possible: this deal is nearly identical to the one that was on the table before. I have no expectations from Hamas. These are vile murderers who must all be eliminated—that has been my mission in life since 1987 when Hamas was founded. Certainly in the past two years as defense minister. But I do have expectations from the government of Israel. In my view, bringing the hostages home is a supreme national and moral duty. It is part of Israel’s legacy, it is central to the IDF’s code of ethics and it is an explicit war objective.' The question remains—did the Israeli government, which you were part of, do everything it could to bring the hostages home? 'I do not believe that the government of Israel did everything it could to bring the hostages home.' × × × How do you respond to the perception that Hamas emerged victorious from the hostage deal—not just because they survived, but because of the images of thousands of Hamas supporters celebrating in Gaza, even as much of the enclave lay in ruins and many thousands had been killed? 'Hamas lost 20,000 fighters. Its infrastructure was dismantled—its production lines, its tunnels and more. But to replace a regime, you need an alternative. If you keep plowing the land without planting anything, nothing new will grow.' Netanyahu kept saying we were on the verge of 'total victory.' But you yourself said, and I quote: 'Hamas is collapsing from within,' 'Hamas is a dismantled organization,' 'Hamas has lost control, has no way to rearm,' 'Hamas’ Gaza station isn’t answering,' 'There’s a bidding war over who will rule Gaza.' Yet, despite all that, Hamas still controls Gaza—even without the deal, that was the reality. 'You need to understand something. Military achievement is not the same as victory. Military victory is a component of victory, but true victory requires a political process. And that process never happened. I've been dealing with this for over a year. On October 26, 2023, I presented a plan that outlined a second phase in Gaza: continuing military operations while simultaneously building an alternative to Hamas rule. The plan included an implementation framework—forces made up of non-Hamas Palestinians, observers from Arab countries and private companies for security. I personally traveled to meet Arab leaders to discuss this. The government refused. They wouldn’t allow it to move forward. And the result is that we got stuck on the political front. 'Now, if you have 5,000 or 10,000 terrorists who still have uniforms—even if they don’t have rockets—they can put on a good show for the media. I don’t underestimate them. And if we allow them to grow, they will rearm.' Some argue that a non-Hamas government in Gaza was never realistic. The current line from Netanyahu’s camp is that the failure was the military’s fault—IDF leadership chose repeated raids instead of holding and clearing territory, leaving Israel with no choice but to make a deal. 'Netanyahu thought the same way I did—but only in private meetings, where Smotrich and Ben-Gvir weren’t present. He doesn’t want to control Gaza in a military occupation. Anyone who wants military rule in Gaza is actually saying, ‘We will lose hundreds of soldiers, and after that, we’ll withdraw because we’re not staying there forever.’ The truth is, if you don’t want to develop an alternative governance in Gaza, then what you’re really saying is: you prefer Hamas to rule. 'Israel will not rebuild settlements in Gaza, no matter how much Smotrich and Ben-Gvir push for it—they know it won’t happen. Netanyahu understands that. Military rule isn’t freedom of action for the IDF. Freedom of action is being able to kill who needs to be killed and strike who needs to be struck. Military rule means running daily life—and that should be done by Palestinians, not Israelis. IDF soldiers, and certainly Israeli civilians, should not remain there forever. We have no business being there. Gaza isn’t Jerusalem, and it’s not Mount Hermon. Unfortunately, whether this war lasts a short or long time, they—Smotrich and Ben-Gvir—will eventually come around to my position. But I don’t want to lose our best soldiers over it along the way.' If in January 2025, Israel returned to the same hostage deal that was on the table in May 2024, and in the meantime, you—the security establishment —dismantled Iran’s 'axis of resistance,' what does that say about Israeli success in Gaza? 'In order to replace a regime, plowing the ground isn’t enough. You have to allow something new to grow there. But because anything new would involve Palestinians that nobody likes—including me—the result was that we didn’t allow it to happen. That left us with only two choices: Hamas or Israel. And once you make it Hamas vs. Israel, the moment you leave for even 42 days (for the cease-fire), Hamas regrows.' Cabinet ministers have said Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi endured unprecedented humiliation in meetings, long before calls for his resignation intensified. 'The chief of staff is a courageous, composed, calculating and highly decisive leader. And he operated under incredibly difficult conditions. First, because he was fighting around the clock. Second, because—living in this country—you saw the political attacks against him, something that never happened before in Israeli wars. 'From my conversations with him, I knew that the moment the next hostage deal was reached, he would step down. We didn’t know when the deal would happen, but in our discussions, it was clear that was his plan. I believe he chose the right moment.' And what about accusations that the IDF General Staff, and Halevi in particular, were not aggressive enough? 'Where were all these critics on October 11, when we proposed the most aggressive operation of all? Where were they then?' × × × Gallant’s next dismissal came as no surprise, just a week after a stunningly successful Air Force strike in Iran. It was clear that Netanyahu was moving full speed ahead with his plan—especially due to pressure from the ultra-Orthodox parties as to the exemption law they were demanding. 'On a personal level, there were no issues,' Gallant says. 'I can work with the prime minister. Every major decision in this war, we made together. We had disagreements on fundamental issues. I believed that since the hostages' lives were hanging by a thread, we needed to act as quickly as possible. He did not agree with me on that. The second issue was everything related to the endgame in Gaza.' The final straw for Netanyahu, almost without a doubt, was the military draft. The ultra-Orthodox parties had threatened—and continue to threaten—to bring down Netanyahu’s government over the issue, and Gallant refused to sign off on a law that would allow wholesale draft exemptions to continue. He has no regrets. 'Look at reality for a moment. We are at war. Hundreds of soldiers have been killed, thousands wounded—many of whom will never return to service. We’ve lost the equivalent of two infantry brigades in sheer numbers. We need to replenish that. There are three ways to do it. One is extending mandatory service, which I recommended a year ago—to 36 months. The second is extending reserve duty, which is already happening automatically. And the third is drafting additional populations. Now, I want you to understand the situation. Every draft year, a quarter of Jewish 18-year-olds—25%—are ultra-Orthodox. One in four. We cannot afford not to draft them, or at least the vast majority of them. That is what I fought for, because of the war. This is no longer just a social necessity; it has become a national necessity. And on top of that, there was no legislation in place for exempting them. Now, that’s the principle of the matter. As for why I was fired—ask the prime minister. But I can tell you for certain: I wasn’t fired because I was a bad defense minister.' You are constantly attacked from within your own party. Likud MK Nissim Vaturi said about you that 'Gallant and Gantz are kissing.' Minister David Amsalem claimed your conduct 'undermined Israel’s security.' 'I won’t respond to every person who says this or that. I acted according to my priorities: first, the State of Israel. After that, the IDF and the security agencies. And only after that—everything else, including myself. That’s how I have always worked, that’s how I conducted myself in this war. And I was willing to pay the price for it. What mattered to me was winning the war. And for 13 straight months, 24/7, as defense minister—I did just that. I managed this war. All paths led to me.' × × × Since leaving office, Gallant has traveled to the U.S. twice for personal trips, flying on regular commercial flights—flights that, due to a technical issue, could easily be rerouted to Spain or Portugal, where he would face a high risk of arrest under the International Criminal Court’s warrant, issued on allegations of genocide in Gaza. Yet he continues to travel as usual. According to him, military leaders around the world praise Israel’s conduct in the war. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I have personal ties with senior officials in democratic governments—defense ministers, leaders, chiefs of staff. What I hear is universal praise—for Israel’s military capabilities, for the IDF’s ethics under the most difficult conditions. General David Petraeus, an authority on modern warfare, gave me a book he wrote about wars from 1945 to today. He told me, ‘I regret writing this book before the war, because this is the most brilliant military campaign since World War II. Nothing like this has ever happened before. What you achieved here is unprecedented. And you fought under the toughest conditions possible—against an enemy embedded underground, among civilians and so on.’' Aren’t you afraid of being arrested abroad because of the Hague warrant? 'I am proud to be accused of defending the State of Israel. In the early days after October 7, I coined the phrase that this was the most devastating day for the Jewish people since World War II. Leaders and officials from around the world came to me, and I told them: 2023 is not 1943. The Jewish people now have the ability to defend themselves, and I was responsible for that—and I did it. That is what I did, and I am proud of it. Thank God, unlike my grandparents and their parents before them, we have a strong army.' You've seen the destruction in Gaza, the images of many dead civilians. There is no doubt that thousands upon thousands were killed. Consider what we know about hostages who were mistakenly killed by the IDF—doesn’t that indicate what might have happened across Gaza? 'In war, mistakes are made—just like in everything else. The difference is that in war, mistakes come with heavy costs. In the end, decisions are in the hands of commanders at different levels, all of whom did their best. And yes, mistakes were made. We don’t need proof of that—we know it happens. I believe our mistakes were smaller than those of other armies, but they exist, and the consequences are always tragic. I deeply regret that. I never wanted to harm a single Palestinian civilian. And I wasn’t alone in that. The chief of staff and many others worked tirelessly to provide humanitarian aid wherever possible.' At the start of the war, you declared: 'I have ordered a complete siege on Gaza—no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed.' But then you worked to supply those things. Where do you actually stand, Yoav Gallant—on providing aid or withholding it? 'There were different phases at the beginning of the war. Early on, it became clear that cutting off fuel wouldn’t destroy Hamas' tunnel electricity supply—other things would collapse first. After the initial stage, we shifted to a strategy dictated by necessity. First, we needed humanitarian aid to enable our military operations. And second, there was a practical reality: without allowing humanitarian aid in, there would be no resupply (military ammunition from the U.S.)—not for Gaza, but for us. Everyone understood that—especially the prime minister and me.' × × × He remains optimistic about the future. 'First and foremost, I believe in the eternity of Israel. Secondly, I believe in the resilience of Israeli society—we will always find solutions, even if we veer off course at times. I thought about this even in the darkest hours of October 7. I draw great strength from the Israeli public’s ability to endure and overcome. And I believe that whether it’s our struggle for democracy, our national narrative or any other challenge, we will stabilize things and fix what needs to be fixed.' Do you intend to run for prime minister? 'I am a soldier of the state. The State of Israel is my life’s work—I have dedicated my life to it. As long as I can help, contribute and lead, I will do so. Beyond that, there are no elections right now. It’s not on the agenda.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bj61vb9y1x	2025-02-12T10:23:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/Bycrc9NzYye/Bycrc9NzYye_1_265_852_480_0_small.jpg

Mediators push to save ceasefire, Egypt to unveil plan to rebuild...	Qatar and Egypt step up their diplomatic efforts as Hamas alleges Israeli violations; Cairo source warns Israeli-American pressure may force military action if Hamas does not meet its commitments by Saturday’s deadline Scrambling to rescue the ceasefire and secure the release of hostages, Qatar and Egypt have intensified their diplomatic push, urging Gaza factions—presumably Hamas—to honor their commitments. In a conversation with Egypt’s 'Al-Qahira Al-Akhbariya' on Wednesday, a Cairo source warned that Hamas’ decision on Monday to postpone Saturday’s scheduled phase of hostage releases has thrown the entire agreement into disarray. The source explained that both Qatar and Egypt are working to preserve the accord and avert any resurgence of violence, pointing to mounting Israeli-American pressure to resume military operations should the hostages remain in captivity by the imposed Saturday noon deadline. In an unexpected turn, President Trump called on Israel to scrap the deal entirely, saying 'all hell will break loose' if every hostage was not released by Saturday afternoon. On Wednesday, Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy to the Middle East repeated the president's threats that if hostages were not freed by Saturday at 12, 'there's going to be a big problem.' Prime Minister Netanyahu issued an ambiguous statement that could be seen as contradictory, after the security cabinet meeting on Tuesday. While he affirmed Israel’s support for the deadline, he failed to clarify whether all hostages—or merely the three slated for release in the sixth phase—were to be freed immediately. A political insider later suggested the demand extends to all nine remaining hostages from the first phase, though a compromise might see only three released on Saturday, with the remainder following swiftly thereafter. Expressing personal skepticism last night, Trump remarked during a meeting with King Abdullah of Jordan, 'Personally, I don’t think they’ll meet the deadline. I think they want to act tough.' Meanwhile, IDF has raised its level of readiness in the south by mobilizing reserve units in anticipation of any potential escalation. These comments from the Egyptian source came just hours after a Hamas delegation—headed by Gaza leader Khalil al-Hayya, who has not been in Gaza since the conflict began—arrived in Cairo to discuss preserving the fragile agreement. A Hamas official later informed Reuters that diplomatic efforts by Egypt and Qatar are being redoubled, with fewer than three days remaining before Trump’s ultimatum expires. On its Al-Aqsa channel, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem insisted that 'intense discussions are underway with mediating countries to compel Israel to fully implement the Gaza ceasefire agreement.' Despite reaffirming its commitment to the pact, Hamas reiterated its threat to withhold hostage releases on Saturday, warning that any delays would be solely Israel’s responsibility, as it continues to violate the deal’s terms. Hamas has also accused Israel of delaying humanitarian aid and the provision of refugee tents—a charge that Israel strongly denies. The United Nations has confirmed a significant increase in aid since the ceasefire took effect, though it also noted that the support remains insufficient for Gaza’s beleaguered population. Many speculate that Hamas’ dramatic announcement to delay the Saturday phase may be partly driven by President Trump’s insistence on a depopulation strategy for Gaza—a policy reportedly endorsed by Netanyahu—and partly by the stalled negotiations for the deal’s second phase. Although Israel dispatched a delegation to Doha earlier this week, reports indicate its sole role was to observe rather than negotiate. Following Hamas’ announcement on Monday and a subsequent meeting of Israel’s Security Cabinet, Netanyahu declared a suspension of second-phase talks, which had scarcely begun. Egypt's idea for Gaza Cairo unveiled the first details of its alternative strategy for Gaza’s reconstruction. Notably, the King of Jordan himself urged Trump to delay its disclosure during their meeting. In an interview with Qatar’s Al-Arabi channel, an Egyptian source explained Cairo was offering a blueprint to rebuild Gaza over the next three to five years without displacing its residents. The plan included two phases: first, the removal of rubble, followed by the systematic construction of new residential complexes. According to the source, the reconstruction effort will start in Rafah and the southern areas of the Strip before extending northward. He added that the comprehensive strategy for rebuilding Gaza would involve the collaborative efforts of Arab states, the European Union, and the United Nations, with additional details expected to emerge next week in a summit meeting of the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE ahead of the Arab summit scheduled to take place in Cairo later this month. Amid these high-stakes maneuvers, pressure was also building internally among Gazans, many of whom were desperate for a path to reconstruction. 'We barely started believing in the ceasefire,' said Rafah resident Lofti Abu Taha to Reuters, emphasizing that 'the people are suffering—they are the true victims.' This deep-seated disillusionment resonates in Israel as well, where some experts remain cautiously optimistic that a resolution might be reached to secure the hostages’ release on Saturday. Notably, Hamas argued that it publicized its threat well in advance precisely to give mediators ample time to find a diplomatic solution.

Lapid, in a scathing rebuke of Netanyahu’s handling of the crisis, urged lawmakers to consider the profound emotional trauma inflicted on hostage families—subjected to contradictory messages—and warned that a return to conflict would likely prove fatal for the hostages, as Hamas appears to have no incentive to let them live. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjm1nnqykl	2025-02-12T08:38:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/12/H19xR4qKyl/H19xR4qKyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Family receives sign of life from hostage Matan Angrest: 'Wounded...	Accounts from released hostages report kidnapped IDF soldier wounded, held under difficult condition; 'We have seen the images of horror, and we expect Netanyahu to advance the next phase of the deal as soon as possible,' father says Hagai Angrest, the father of kidnapped soldier Matan Angrest, said Wednesday afternoon that his family had received a sign of life from him through hostages recently released in the latest prisoner exchanges. The accounts confirm that the armored corps soldier is alive but being held wounded under difficult conditions. This news comes six months after he was last seen in a recording from Gaza. 'We heard from the returning hostages that our beloved son Matan is alive. It was deeply moving for us,' said Angrest. 'It’s time to bring him home—along with all the others—without delay. We expect Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to advance the next phase of the deal as soon as possible. We all saw the harrowing images on Saturday—scenes of horror in 2025, right here in Israel. Bring back our Matan and all the hostages immediately. Their situation is dire; the time to act is now.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Angrest described the intense emotions of waiting for hostages to emerge from captivity and the shock of seeing their condition. 'We were all on edge Saturday, hoping to see people coming out of hell alive. When we saw the images, we were horrified. We know these hostages from delegations, but we barely recognized them,' he said, referring to the recently released captives Or Levy, Ohad Ben Ami, and Eli Sharabi.

Israel-Lebanon cese-fire to be extended past month of Ramadan, re...	Lebanon official denies Saudi Channel report; IDF want to hold on to 5 key hills , a demand Lebanese President rejects; International mediators and US envoy Morgan Ortagus prepare efforts to resolve the border dispute Israel and Lebanon agreed to extend the cease-fire agreement signed to end the fighting with Hezbollah, until after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan at the end of March, Saudi Arabian al-Hadath channel reported on Wednesday. A Lebanese official denied the report. According to the channel, Israel will maitain troops presence in certain areas, mostly in the eastern sector. Sources told the channel that Hezbollah-allie Lebanon's parliamentary speaker Nabih Berry agreed to the entention and Israel agreed to leave South Lebanon gradully in the coming days but did not agree to end targeted strikes against Hezbollah terrorists. Earlier, Lebanese media outlets said Israel wanted to hold on to five strategic points on Lebanese territory until the end of the month. Al-Awida, Al-Hamamas, Al-Aziah, Al-Labuna, and Jabal Balat offer strategic control over the region. According to The Independent in Arabic, holding these positions would enable the IDF to monitor movements and cut off critical roads connecting Lebanese border towns. The reports expresses concern that the ceasefire extension might allow Israel to bolster its hold on these key security points. Reuters quoted a Lebanese source and a foreign diplomat on Wednesday who said the IDF has formally requested permission to remain at the five sites. Lebanese broadcaster LBCI reported this request was submitted to the oversight committee overseeing the ceasefire and Resolution 1701. LBCI further said Lebanon rejected the request, while Al Jazeera quoted President Joseph Aoun demanding, 'Israel must complete its withdrawal from Lebanon by the deadline of February 18.' Lebanese channel Al-Jadeed later reported that Lebanon not only rejects the request to extend the ceasefire in these areas but is also calling for the deployment of international forces—or a combined operation by the Lebanese Army and the oversight committee—at the five points along the border where IDF seeks to remain. Military expert Akram Sarawi, speaking to The Independent in Arabic, described the five locations as commanding vistas over vast areas of Lebanon, effectively serving as military command posts. He argued that Israel’s persistence in these areas is driven by broader political objectives, linking its presence with a push to disarm Hezbollah north of the Litani River. Sarawi noted these hills are seen as forming a strategic defense line for Israeli communities, further justifying, in Israel’s view, continued control to secure their citizens. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another source suggested Israel’s aim is to prevent residents from returning to the southern border, fearing that repopulation could provide a foundation for Hezbollah support. Oversight committee meeting delayed The Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper Al-Akhbar reported that the oversight committee meeting on the ceasefire agreement—originally scheduled to be held tomorrow in Ras al-Naqoura—has been postponed until Friday. The delay is intended to allow for further consultations regarding the future of the ceasefire. The meeting is expected to deal with a proposal to deploy international forces at the five key points, with one French proposal suggesting a mission led by French troops. However, Lebanon maintains no adjustments can be made to UNIFIL’s mandate without the agreement of both the Lebanese Army and international forces on the deployment mechanism. Sources further explained that introducing American or French military personnel along the Lebanese border would serve Israel’s interests. They added that the oversight committee appears to be leveraging this issue to pressure Lebanon into accepting Israel’s operational demands in return for international support for the country’s reconstruction efforts. U.S. envoy’s upcoming visit These discussions occur as Lebanese reports indicate an imminent visit by Morgan Ortagus, the U.S. Deputy Special Envoy to the Middle East. Lebanon is still reeling from her pointed remarks during a previous visit. According to the Lebanese newspaper Al-Joumhouria, Ortagus is expected to visit again before the weekend, with the goal of ensuring Israel’s withdrawal from South Lebanon by February 18. Persisting border disputes Even before the recent Israeli ground operation, Lebanon has long disputed Israel’s control of points along the 'Blue Line.' Lebanon contends that Israel occupies 13 points along the border—areas it sees as rightfully Lebanese. Stretched from Ras al-Naqoura eastward, these points have been a recurring subject in discussions aimed at reaching a lasting border agreement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byoln7qtjl	2025-02-12T07:14:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/03/SylmE6fROkl/SylmE6fROkl_1_145_1601_901_0_small.jpg

Egypt says Al-Sisi will not come to White House if Trump's Gaza p...	Sources say AL-Sisi invited to Washington by Trump in a call earlier this month although no date set; Hamas welcomes the opposition of Egypt, Jordan to Trump's plan to resettle Gazan in neighboring states : 'There is no place for uprooting our people' Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi will not attend his planned visit to the White House if the talks to be herld there with U.S. President Donald Trump include his plant to displace residents of the Gaza Strip, two Egyptian security sources told Reuters on Wednesday.Al-Sisi was invited to the White House when the two leaders spoke earlier this month but no date for the visit, was set. Trump stunned the Arab world and sparked outrage when he presented a plan which included the removal of a large part of the Palestinian population from Gaza and the U.S. taking over the territory to rebuild it as a reviera. Trump said that Egypt and Jordan should take in the Palestinians, an idea that was widely rejected by the Arab states. On Tuesday, King Abdullah of Jordan was hosted at the White House. In a statement alongside Abdullah, the American president said that the Palestinians will live safely somewhere other than Gaza. 'This is the unified Arab position,' King Abdullah said, during his meeting with Trump at the White House on Tuesday. 'Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all. Achieving just peace on the basis of the two-state solution is the way to ensure regional stability. This requires US leadership. President Trump is a man of peace. He was instrumental in securing the Gaza ceasefire. We look to the United States and all stakeholders in ensuring it holds.'

'There is no supplier that compares to the Americans, which is why for so long Egypt has been happy to maintain this relationship, but it wouldn't be at the expense of their own national interest,' said H.A. Hellyher, senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. Al-Sisi has repeatedly said Egypt would never facilitate the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza, which Cairo would view as a serious threat to Egypt's own security, including by breeding extremism and providing a pretext for future Israeli attacks, as well as an injustice to the Palestinians. Meanwhile, Hamas welcomed Jordan and Egypt's opposition to Trump's plan.

Yarden Bibas' sister: 'Ever since the terrorists told him about S...	After 484 days in captivity, Bibas was able to hug his sister Ofri, and his first question was about the fate of his wife and children; She talks about his condition, his consciousness, the hell he experienced and the struggle that will continue as long as Shiri, Ariel and Kfir are still in the Gaza Strip Ofri Bibas Levy was at a meeting when the IDF officer assigned to assist the family called her. It happened on Friday, on the afternoon of January 31, and he cautiously alerted her that an unofficial list was circulating online with the names of the hostages expected to be released the next day, including the name of her younger brother, Yarden Bibas. An hour of rapid heartbeats passed before the phone rang again. It was the officer, and this time he announced to her: 'Yarden is on the list. He’s coming home.' The first thing she did was tell her children. 'I told them that Uncle Dodgey was coming back,' she shares. 'I explained to them that I was going to meet him, and that they would be with Dad during this time. I told them that we were very happy, but that Ariel, Kfir and Shiri still hadn’t returned. I was in a whirlwind, and since I’m a practical person, I immediately thought about logistics. What would I do with the children? How would I leave them? It was Shabbat, and there was no kindergarten and no social settings. There was great excitement and also a lot of concerns, which didn’t go away until the next day, when I saw him leave there and I began to understand what he had been through.' Among the thousands of stories, footage and tragedies of the October 7 massacre, the Bibas family has become a symbol. For more than 70 weeks, millions of Israelis – and who knows how many more around the world, have been following with concern, uncertainty and hope the fate of Yarden and Shiri Bibas, and their children Ariel and Kfir, the youngest in Hamas captivity. This cruel story remains open, since Shiri and the children have not yet returned, but the release of the father Yarden from the hands of Hamas terrorists is the beginning, perhaps, of the healing journey that he and his family so desperately need. Nine days after he returned to Israel from captivity in Gaza, Bibas and his family are trying to complete the puzzle whose pieces have been scattered over the past 16 months. In an interview with Ynet, Ofri Bibas Levy, Yarden's sister, who was released from the hospital on Monday, tries to explain as much as possible about his condition, his consciousness, the hell he experienced and the struggle that will continue as long as Shiri, Ariel and Kfir are still in the Gaza Strip. He's a modest and private man, and it's hard for him to grasp and deal with the fact that he and his family are known to everyone 'For us, nothing is over,' she clarifies. 'We are at the height of the event.' Regarding Hamas' announcement that it is suspending the hostage release deal, she says: 'This is exactly what we feared after the negotiating team did not leave on the 16th day of the first phase as agreed in the outline, and in light of the latest statements.' Ofri is indeed beginning to form a certain picture of what happened to her brother, but the details and gaps that need to be filled in are enormous. 'Every day, Yarden discovers new things, good and bad,' she says. 'There's so much information to fill in, the gap is crazy. There are 16 months that need to be bridged. Every day he finds out about a friend who was kidnapped or murdered. Either he asks, or things come up in conversations. He mentions something and I fill in the details. We do everything slowly, at his own pace. 'It's important for us to give him back his sense of control and independence. Show him that what he wants and what he needs is important. He's the center. We do everything to help him get back to being a person with choices, with desires, with rights. For example, he met some of his friends, and also members of our family and Shiri's, but I try to arrange the times in such a way that it's slow, one by one and not together. I make sure he wants it and is ready. We surround him, protect him, with him all the time. And yes, there are times when he asks to be alone. He's a modest and private man, and it's hard for him to grasp and deal with the fact that he and his family are known to everyone. The photos, the details, the stories. 'For someone who has come out of such a disconnection into all this, it's a lot to absorb.' You are not alone anymore Bibas-Levy left her home in the north for the center that same Friday, after a phone call from the officer who told her that Yarden was returning. Early the next morning, she was already on her way to the meeting place with him in the Re'im camp. 'I traveled with the psychologist who accompanied us on behalf of the army, who managed the psychological integration process,' she recalls. 'The trip passed quickly, mainly in thoughts and conversations about what I would say to Yarden when I saw him for the first time, and what he might say to me. While I was watching the broadcasts and preparing for the ceremony in Gaza. Somehow it calmed me to see that they were creating a relatively sterile area, a large plaza clean of the Gazan crowd.' As soon as she sat down in the family room at the Re'im base, she saw Ofer Calderon on the screen getting out of the terrorists' vehicle to join the Red Cross teams. Two minutes later, Yarden also left. 'It took us a second to realize that it was him. Yarden is a relatively shy guy, and this is not a situation that was comfortable for him in any way. But he walked with his head held high, strong. Before he got on stage, they asked him to stop, take a picture and wave, but he didn't listen to them and kept walking,' she said. According to her, 'It really bothered us that in various places in the media they analyzed his body language and focused a lot on the tragedies in the situation. In general, all kinds of interpretations focus on the tragedy associated with Yarden and the family, and that makes me angry. Be happy that he came back and he's alive, and that he came out strong and upright and proud. Beyond that, we still don't know about the fate of Shiri and the children, and we hold on to hope until the last moment and won't give up on it.' What did you say to each other in the first hug? 'I told him, 'You're not alone anymore.' That's what came out of me. The first thing Yarden said was actually a question, about Shiri and the children. I understood that he understood the situation as we understand it, that there is concern, but that we don't know. He came out in the same place where we are, and that was reassuring because we didn't have to mediate too much for him. We reassured him that there is no certainty, that we hope, and that despite the concerns, we are not giving up. We didn't have any more certain answers, but I could also give him hope. It's clear that, until his family arrives, he is still there, on October 7. He came out while he was still there that day, that is, that's all they had there. That memory.' What else remains with you from the hug? 'It was all so surreal. Since last year we've been seeing pictures of families hugging their loved ones who were released, and it's as if they've caught me there. It still doesn't sink in that he's here. I still can't believe he was there, and that Shiri and the children aren't here. Nothing has been processed,' she says. 'He also remembers in detail the day they told him they were supposedly not alive, before the video was released. Since then he's tried to understand whether it's true or not. Whether it's psychological terrorism or if there's truth to it. Through the terrorists, and the hostages he met, he's tried to understand, and all this time he hasn't stopped hoping. That's what kept him going. We all still hope that it's all lies and that they'll come back to us. It's a very complex struggle.' A week after returning to Israel, Bibas sent a message through the media, in which he directly addressed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and said: 'Bring back my family, my friends, bring everyone home. As long as my light is still there, everything is dark here.' Ofri emphasizes that 'he formulated it all by himself. It was important to him that they knew he formulated it. It's amazing to see the clarity and memory of those who came out of there. No one imagined they would come out with so much strength.' Which Yarden did you get back? 'Yarden came back and it's him, but it's not him either. Not the same Yarden. We're not who we were either. First of all, he's very thin. I saw it when he got out of the car. He's a big, broad guy, and the clothes kind of covered it up, but he lost a lot of weight. After the first meeting, we laughed at him for asking for a Bamba. 'The truth is that I can sit down and talk to him. After a year and four months I send him a text message on the phone. I am not afraid for him at any given moment. I know that he has eaten and slept and that he is showering. These are basic things that we did not know. There is still a lot of uncertainty ahead of us, and we will still have a lot to deal with, but Yarden is here and he is strong. He is not the same Yarden, but his humor, the same kind of jokes. On the day of the statement I made in Sheba, he laughed at me, 'My vegan and dairy sister – what does your connection to the struggle have to do with it?'. That is him.' Getting along with the kidnappers Throughout the entire period of captivity, Yarden Bibas was held in tunnels and was barely exposed to the media. Yet, his family was amazed by the details he knew and how informed he was. 'He knew that the October 7 event was on a large scale,' she says. 'He knew about the demonstrations that were taking place. He knew about the war in the north and the evacuees. They were constantly mixing up the hostages, so he met others, and through them he learned things. For example, he knew about Trump's involvement. It's amazing. On the Friday before the release, he saw a broadcast on an Arab channel that they were supposed to be released. He tells quite a bit, but there are still a lot of things that we don't know about what happened to him,' according to his sister. Yarden was held at the beginning of the captivity with Ofer Calderon, during the weeks in which the conditions that they were held in was described as extremely terrible, in cages, under unbearable psychological terror. Later, they were separated, and before the release they were held together again. Bibas Levy talks about conditions when they were held in the tunnels. 'They were held underground. He described to us the humidity and the mold and the darkness. They slept on mattresses on the floor. Of course, hunger was a major issue, and they received water rations. Their lives were in the hands of those who were guarding them. One way to deal with this was to try to get closer to them and, indeed, he came out of there speaking fluent Arabic. They spent most of the day sleeping, they simply slept most of the time and only woke up for food, when it was available. Here and there they also played cards. They talked a lot among themselves, the kidnapped. Already at the base in Re'im, Yarden told how much he cared about us. 'He told the kidnapped people who were with him about us. He mentioned that he had told about his nephews, so I told him that he had another nephew who was just born. He looked at me with a surprised look, I showed him pictures and he got excited,' she said. Last May, there was a feeling that the parties were getting closer to signing an agreement. In Gaza, too, preparations were already being made. 'This was before we entered Rafah,' says Ofri. 'Yarden said that according to the feelings, and according to what the terrorists told them, a deal was signed. That was the understanding. They really started to organize themselves physically. As we know, it exploded. How terrible.' After being released from the hospital, Bibas moved to Kfar Maccabiah. He will not be able to return to his home in Nir Oz, at least until the reconstruction of the destroyed kibbutz is complete. 'Kfar Maccabiah is an intermediate stage, short or long, we don't know, but it is of course not the final home. It will allow his parents to be with him and continue his care,' explains Bibas Levy. 'The physical rehabilitation is obvious, but it is also the easier part. The coping that will take them years is for the rehabilitation of the soul. We see them smiling and laughing, but the rehabilitation will take a long time.' Peak of fragility, peak of struggle Bibas Levy, herself a mother of three small children, carries the weight of the struggle to return all the hostages on her shoulders. From her home in northern Israel, she has been everywhere: demonstrations, rallies, meetings with ministers, discussions in Knesset committees, marches, speeches at various events and, of course, numerous interviews with the media. Even now, just a few days after her brother finally returned from hell, for her nothing has stopped: 'The struggle is not over for us, we are at the peak of the event. We will not stop fighting for Shiri and the children, nor for the rest of the hostages. This is what we, the families, promised each other, and this is what will happen.' That is a lot of responsibility. 'I'm trying to find the balance between home and the public campaign and my desire to be with Yarden. It's not easy, it requires a lot of concessions from all kinds of directions, but the struggle is still ongoing. Nothing is over. There's always a feeling that everything could stop at any moment. Everything is fragile, and the risks are very high,' she says. 'This reality is difficult and cruel for the families, the public, and of course the hostages who are waiting. We are starting to see them returning, which is wonderful, but the feelings are mixed. The urgency to get everyone out as quickly as possible is obvious, but instead of speeding their return, we are delaying talks about the second phase. What else needs to happen? Why would three released hostages be released in such a terrible state? So we'll be shocked and realize again that they don't have time? It's like we knew that dozens of hostages had been murdered, and then when the murder of the six came in the summer, we discovered what their nutritional situation was and we were shocked. 'In the first releases in this deal, the hostages seemed fine, but it's clear that they are not okay. The gap between the physical and what they are going through mentally is like an abyss. The decision-makers know very well what is happening there, about the abuse, the starvation, the danger to their lives. They know everything, and they are not doing what is necessary to save them. Semantics are not important. We must get everyone out of there as quickly as possible, both the living and the dead. We must end this nightmare.' In the meantime, the cabinet convened on Tuesday, and the delegation in Doha did not discuss Phase II. 'I wish I could say that I am surprised. This is consistent with all the conduct and the dragging of feet, as if there is time. So we will wait a few more days. We are counting a week as if it is nothing. For people in the government it is nothing, for those who are there, it is life or death.' How do you comment on the various statements, for example by Bezalel Smotrich, who said that 'there will be no pressure to take steps in exchange for the release of the kidnapped?' 'I really have no words anymore. How dare he? One hand on the keyboard welcomes the return of the hostages, with the other hand they oppose Phase II, prevent the return of others and are proud that they torpedoed the previous deal. I do not know by what moral standards they are living. True, the deal is bad. No one thinks it is good. But it saves lives. This is what you, Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, who are members of this government, have managed to bring. You couldn't have done better than that. I don't know if you tried. 'Let's finish this and bring everyone back, and then we'll deal with whatever comes our way. The war with our enemies will never end. The idea that some deal or other will end it or prevent it is simply lying to us all, and to themselves. It is exploiting the suffering of the hostages for agendas that I no longer understand.

It was and remains with him. To threaten Hamas now, which could delay the next round of returns, when all that needs to be done is the opposite, to promote everyone's release is infuriating. How is it possible that we, as citizens of Israel, are pinning all our hopes on the president of the United States, Donald Trump? We don't need to trust anyone else.' Speaking of the prime minister and ministers, did anyone talk to you after Yarden's return? 'The prime minister didn't talk to us, nor did the president or any of the ministers. Benny Gantz contacted us, but no meeting has taken place yet. Hili Tropper, who is in contact with the family, wrote to me. The rest didn't call to congratulate Yarden on his return or ask how he was doing. They don't want to face him and look us in the face, but they don't have the right not to do it. It won't be pleasant, maybe it's not an image for an election campaign, but they have to deal with the consequences of the decisions they've made over 16 months. Even if we don't agree to talk to them, it's their duty to do it and let us choose. As far as we're concerned, we won't stop. We just won't.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bygekg5kyg	2025-02-12T05:01:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/SyQyfOj00kg/SyQyfOj00kg_0_0_3000_1691_0_small.jpg

Conference of Presidents chief: If 40% of Gazans want out, why no...	William Daroff hopes Trump’s unconventional approach will encourage other leaders to propose their own solutions for Gaza U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to encourage Gazans to relocate and place the U.S. in charge of the Gaza Strip is 'a breath of fresh air' and 'a positive thing,' according to William Daroff, CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish American Organizations, an umbrella group representing mainstream American Jewry. Speaking on the ILTV News Podcast, Daroff noted that 'for decades, the policy as it relates to Gaza has been spinning in circles, and no one has come up with a cogent day-after plan – a plan for what Gaza should look like or who's going to be in charge of it.' The podcast featuring Daroff will be published in the coming days. Trump, he said, has at least proposed an idea. Daroff expressed hope that Trump's unconventional thinking will inspire other leaders to propose their own solutions. He criticized the Arab world for failing to improve the lives of Gazans. 'They've been totally AWOL,' Daroff said, pointing out that in other global crises, populations often relocate. Yet, he questioned, 'Why is Egypt somehow able to put up a big wall and say that the Gazans must stay in harm's way?' Citing polling data from before October 7, Daroff noted that more than 40% of Gazans preferred to live elsewhere. Given that, he asked, 'Why not encourage them? Why not incentivize them?' He blamed Hamas for the hostage crisis, calling the group 'suicidal' and 'genocidal.' However, he also noted that U.S. policy under the previous administration at times had a negative impact. 'The Biden administration pressured the Israeli government to relent a bit, to let in far more humanitarian goods, which certainly the people of Gaza deserve, but that Hamas certainly did not deserve. And it did bolster them,' Daroff said. But will Trump's new ultimatum—that 'all hell will break loose' if the hostages are not released by Saturday at noon—be effective? Daroff isn't sure. He does know that Trump has successfully negotiated with Colombia, Canada, and Mexico. Given that, he said, this approach may work. If not, he suggested, it could at least push the parties back to the table and revive the previous version of Phase I of the deal, which allowed some hostages to be released each week.

Daroff is confident that Trump will succeed in securing peace with Saudi Arabia. He pointed to intelligence reports suggesting that one reason Hamas carried out the October 7 attack when it did was that Israel and Saudi Arabia were on the verge of normalization. Achieving peace now, he said, would be 'the icing on the cake' after winning the war—bringing the hostages home and eradicating Hamas. If stopping Saudi normalization was one of Hamas's motives, Daroff argued, then not only would Hamas be destroyed and its leader, Yahya Sinwar, eliminated, but his goal of blocking peace with Saudi Arabia would ultimately be reversed. 'The dividends that could flow from that would be a great part of the epitaph of Sinwar,' Daroff said. Netanyahu to Address Jewish Leaders in Jerusalem Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet with delegates from the Conference of Presidents next week at their 50th annual event in Jerusalem. He will also deliver his first open remarks in English to a Jewish delegation since Donald Trump took office. Dozens of top Jewish leaders will be in Israel from February 16 to 20 for the gathering, which includes meetings with high-level officials, panel discussions, and site visits. Netanyahu did not meet with Jewish leaders during his recent visit to Washington. Instead, he spent a morning with Christian leaders in a meeting arranged by incoming U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee. Daroff defended the decision, explaining that Netanyahu's office had been working to arrange such a meeting but ultimately ran out of time. 'I wish there had been a meeting, but I don't think it's incredibly indicative of much other than the fact that the prime minister had a very busy schedule,' Daroff said. Daroff acknowledged the strong and diverse opinions about Netanyahu among American Jews. However, he suggested they may view him more favorably than Israelis since they are not exposed to the constant, often critical, coverage of him in Israeli media. A recent poll published by the Hebrew daily Maariv showed a surge in support for Netanyahu's Likud Party. Netanyahu's personal approval ratings remain low despite some gains in the war. Meanwhile, protests over the hostages and dissatisfaction with the government's actions continue to fill the streets, even as a hostage deal begins to move forward. 'He's controversial,' Daroff said. 'He's certainly controversial among Conference of Presidents organizations.' But he said, love or hate Netanyahu, he is glad to see that in the few weeks Trump has been in office, America and the U.S. seem to be in sync. 'I'm very much a supporter of, first, the US and Israel having no daylight between them,' Daroff said. 'I think that it makes Israel stronger and makes America stronger for our adversaries to see that we speak as one. 'But secondly, there inevitably will be disagreements, that those disagreements are aired in private and not in public,' he continued. 'I think that when they are aired in public, it lessens the perception of the bond by America and Israel's adversaries. And that's a problem for America and Israel. And I think that what we've seen over these last three weeks is a change in tone, for sure, as distinct from the previous administration.' Jewish Unity in the Face of Rising Antisemitism The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) recently reported a sharp 340% increase in global antisemitic incidents. Additionally, a staggering 46% of the world's adult population holds deeply rooted antisemitic views. The Conference of Presidents has been at the forefront of combating antisemitism. According to Daroff, Jewish organizations are working together in ways he has 'never seen before.' 'Jewish organizations, post-October 7, are very much engaging together. We're collaborating very much, which indicates where the American Jewish community is in general,' he said. Beyond the 'punch in the gut' of the Hamas attack, Daroff explained that Jewish leaders and organizations were shocked by the silence—or even opposition—of those they had previously considered allies. 'That really brought about a resurgence of Jewish self-awareness and engagement that, among other things, has our Jewish organizations working well together,' he said. He emphasized the importance of working with governments at all levels to combat antisemitism, especially on university campuses, which saw violent anti-Israel and antisemitic protests last year. Daroff noted that the Trump administration had launched an investigation into several universities, conducted proactively by the Department of Education. 'Distinct from other times in our history as a people, we have the government on our side,' he said. 'When we have issues, we can turn to them and work together. And that's something that worked well with the federal government in the last administration and continues today.' He also highlighted a new Department of Justice task force and a key legal measure related to college campuses. Under existing law, individuals on visas who provide material support for terror can have their visas revoked. 'There are a few of these provocateurs who are the problem, and I think by showing them that actions have consequences, we can really change the climate here,' Daroff noted. While he feels safe, he also believes 'it's important to be a little scared' and for the community 'to stay on our toes.' He admitted he will be more hesitant to engage with individuals and organizations that denied what happened on October 7, though this stance may evolve over time to accomplish other goals. 'Our eyes will be very open, and I think there probably will be a much higher price of entry in order for us to engage with them,' he added. Above all, Daroff stressed the importance of Jewish unity. 'We can count on each other, and we are stronger as a people when we are unified.' While he doesn't believe anything good can come from October 7, he acknowledged that it has clarified for many people 'what's important, who's important, and who they can count upon.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hknu4aykkx	2025-02-12T04:29:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/12/S14cWmqYke/S14cWmqYke_0_263_2425_1366_0_small.jpg

Jordanian Bar Association deputy head Walid Al-Adwan actions garner support on social media and no condemnation from government; Israel says incident could harm relations Israel issued a strong condemnation to Jordan on Wednesday after Walid Al-Adwan, deputy head of the Jordanian Bar Association, painted the Israeli flag on the ground at the entrance of the association’s building and declared, 'Everyone who enters must step on it.' A photo of Al-Adwan standing at the entrance with the flag beneath his feet was circulated on social media. Israel's Foreign Ministry called the act an 'incitement that does not align with the spirit of the peace agreement between the countries' and filed an official protest with Jordan’s embassy in Israel. The ministry urged Jordan’s government to 'condemn the incident and take steps to prevent such actions in the future,' warning that 'the lack of condemnation is concerning, as expressions of hatred like this can harm trust and cooperation between the countries and, as recent incidents at the shared border have shown, lead to violence against Israeli citizens.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Al-Adwan posted on Facebook alongside the photo: 'In accordance with the Bar Association Council’s decision, it has been done. The presence of this flag in the union is dishonorable. Everyone who enters must trample it. The association opposes normalization.' His post was met with support, with one commenter sharing the image and thanking him for his 'steadfast principles.' Al-Adwan also addressed U.S. President Donald Trump's call to relocate Gazans as part of his plan to 'take over' the Strip on social media: 'Palestine will remain free and proud, with Jerusalem as its capital. No to displacement.

Is Iran crumbling?	Crippling sanctions that could collapse Iran’s economy and bring its oil exports down to zero—that is what President Trump’s team aims to achieve in dealing with the Islamic Republic of Iran Following the rollout of Trump’s 'Maximum Pressure 2.0' sanctions campaign against the Islamic regime in Iran, hardliners within the regime have doubled down on anti-American rhetoric, reversing their previously dovish willingness to engage in negotiations. Crippling sanctions that could collapse Iran’s economy and bring its oil exports down to zero—that is what President Trump’s team aims to achieve in dealing with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The move has been met with hostility from regime officials, who have already attempted to assassinate the president multiple times before the election. As the Islamic Republic marked 46 years since the 1979 revolution yesterday, Iran’s currency plummeted to record lows. The day’s festivities were dominated by regime-led incitement against both Israel and President Trump, including theatrical mock arrests of Trump in the streets and renewed threats against him from senior officials. This comes as Trump has explicitly stated he prefers a verified nuclear deal over war to halt the regime’s rogue pursuit of nuclear weapons—a move Tehran has dismissed as 'insincere.' In recent days, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has repeatedly shut down the possibility of negotiations with the U.S., issuing threats and hosting Hamas leadership in a show of solidarity against both the United States and Israel. Earlier this week, an IRGC-affiliated Telegram channel released a video threatening to assassinate Trump, and Iranian MP Mojtaba Zarei explicitly called for the U.S. president’s assassination. However, as the regime marked 46 years of Islamic rule, ordinary Iranians responded by chanting 'Death to the dictator' from their balconies across the country. In southwestern Iran, large protests erupted against the regime, highlighting growing domestic discontent.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1dhagqt1g	2025-02-12T04:11:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/09/14/ByZipxQJbj/ByZipxQJbj_0_43_1300_732_0_small.jpg

Kremlin: Russian citizen released from US prison	The Kremlin said Wednesday that a Russian citizen was freed in the United States in exchange for Moscow's release of American Marc Fogel, but refused to identify them until they arrive in Russia.

Fogel, an American history teacher who was deemed wrongfully detained by Russia, has been released and was returned to the U.S. on Tuesday in what the White House described as a diplomatic thaw that could advance negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. Fogel was arrested in August 2021 and was serving a 14-year prison sentence. Steve Witkoff, a special envoy for U.S. President Donald Trump, left Russia with Fogel and brought him to the White House, where Trump greeted him.

Father of American-Israeli hostage says he trusts Trump to bring ...	With his son Itay still held captive by Hamas, Ruby Chen urges leaders to prioritize the safe return of all hostages and stresses that bringing them home must transcend political considerations Ruby Chen, father of American-Israeli hostage Itay Chen, has called for accelerated negotiations to secure the release of all remaining captives. In an interview with Ynetnews, Chen stressed the urgency of concluding the process, especially in light of Hamas' announcement that the next scheduled releases would be postponed due to alleged Israeli violations of the cease-fire. 'This puts us in a very difficult place,' Chen said. 'We have been advocating inside the White House and to the president [Trump] that we would like to see the last hostages come out with a defined date. The president understands how fragile this framework is and that it needs to be expedited. The way to get to the last hostage is by moving negotiations forward and reaching the endgame — ending the war between Hamas and Israel and securing the hostages’ release.' Chen also welcomed the firm stance taken by U.S. President Donald Trump, who recently warned that if Hamas does not release all hostages by noon on Saturday, 'all hell will break out.' 'That's the type of language we've been missing from the previous administration,' Chen shared. 'The majority of the families welcome this policy, as well as Mr. Steve Witkoff’s efforts that enabled us to get to this framework. But we need to get to the endgame, and that means the last hostage. Israel has done a lot — it has released assets and withdrawn from parts of Gaza. But to secure the last hostage, there aren't many cards left, which is why negotiations must be expedited.' As a dual U.S. and Israeli citizen, Chen expressed trust in the American administration’s commitment to the hostages’ release. 'If I needed to put my trust in one person, only one person, I would put it in the hands of the president of the United States,' he said. 'This is difficult to say because I'm also a citizen of Israel, but I’ve looked into his eyes, I’ve talked to his team. They’ve made this a top priority, not out of political calculus, but because it’s the right thing to do. I hope Israel’s prime minister understands that this should supersede any other war objective, including the dismantling of Hamas. First and foremost comes the release of the hostages.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Addressing concerns about linking hostage negotiations to broader political strategies for Gaza, Chen was clear in his stance. 'I'm a simple dad. I don't want to get into politics, but coupling the 'day after' with the release of the hostages is not a good strategy,' he said. 'The state of Israel failed me, my family and many other families by allowing the abduction of over 240 citizens, including my son, who was serving as an IDF soldier protecting civilians. Israel has a legal and moral obligation to bring him back — no matter what it takes.' Chen dismissed concerns that opposition from hardline Israeli ministers, such as Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Settlements and National Missions Minister Orit Strock, could delay the hostage agreement’s second phase. 'I think the president has a very direct line to the prime minister,' he said. 'He views those types of ministers as a nuisance. He doesn’t pay that much attention to Smotrich, Strock, or Ben-Gvir—and I say that based on what I’ve seen inside the White House. 'The president does things because it’s the right thing to do, and in this case, he has prioritized the hostages. I hope Israel’s prime minister understands his responsibility—before political considerations, before what Smotrich says or doesn’t say. Eighty percent of the Israeli people want to see the last hostage out, and they want to see it as soon as possible.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1h8n6yyjx	2025-02-12T01:15:58-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/12/r1IAe0tKyx/r1IAe0tKyx_65_0_345_194_0_small.jpg

IDF reports two suspects in southern Gaza struck after they came to collect a drone 'that was being monitored' by Israel; Security sources said one person was killed and another was injured, as reports from Gaza describe 'bombing buildings' in the Tel a-Sultan neighborhood of Rafah; Several attempts to smuggle weapons into Gaza using drones have been identified, IDF says A man was killed Wednesday in an IDF strike in Rafah in southern Gaza. The IDF said shortly after the attack that an IDF aircraft attacked a drone that crossed from Israel back into Gaza, and two suspects who picked it up in the southern Gaza Strip, in what is suspected to be an attempt to smuggle weapons. In Gaza, it was reported that the IDF attacked the Tel a-Sultan neighborhood in the west of Rafah.

Family of hostage Yosef Haim Ohana learns he is alive	He was abducted into Gaza on October 7 after helping injured at Nova music festival; Family going public about it after seeing condition of hostages in last round of releases Hanna Mastronov, the aunt of hostage Yosef Haim Ohana, who was kidnapped from the Nova music festival in Kibbutz Re'im, said Wednesday morning in an interview with Ynet that the family received sign of life from him following the last round of hostage releases on Saturday: 'We have a clear indication that he is alive,' she shared. 'There are signs of life that indicate that he is alive.' 'We first chose to deal with a story under the radar. The fact that we are now going to the media is because we understand that there is probably not enough understanding of how serious the situation is,' she said. 'When we saw the people who returned last Saturday, it broke us even more than we were already broken. The feelings are not simple at all.' She referred to the return of hostages Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levi , saying that 'it was a shadow of people, not people. I am happy that they returned, but I think about the others. What will happen to the others? Whoever looks at Sharabi, I don't know if he would have survived a few more weeks in captivity if they hadn't brought him. It's time to wake up. There is no time, absolutely no time - they need to return today.' She added that Yosef Haim is 'a strong man - both in mind and body. But even human strength has limits. We are approaching 500 days. We didn't think it would last this long.' She said that when the family met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, she asked him to bring her nephew back. 'I told him that we are not politicians. To everyone's credit - Gal Hirsch, Shin Bet, everyone - they are available and provide a response. But behind the response there must be a basis of trust. If everyone is a humanitarian case stand behind your words,' she said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'There is no place to stop (the hostage releases under the agreement) but to continue on,' the aunt added. 'We did not disagree as a family about the order of priority - sick people, women. I am happy for everyone who returned, every soul in Israel - we are happy for them. But we cannot count on the young people to survive forever. We are approaching the 500th day.' Yosef Chaim Ohana, 24, from Kiryat Malachi, was kidnapped from Nova by Hamas terrorists. His mother said that Yosef and his friend helped the injured at the Nova festival, them to the paramedics and ambulances. 'When I called his friend, he told me that when the shooting started, they helped the wounded and took them to receive treatment,' his mother said. 'They tried to run toward the main road, but then they saw that they were being fired at by RPGs. Yosef Haim ran to the left, and the friend ran to the right and hid under the car. The friend was hit by the missile, and managed to see Yosef Haim peeking from behind the car behind which he was hiding. After that, he didn't see him again.' 'The last information was about 5 months ago' On the other hand, Zvika Mor is still waiting to receive information about his hostage son, Eitan. When asked in an interview with Ynet whether any of the returned hostages have come forward with information about his son, the father said: 'Not yet. And we are indeed waiting. I hope we too will receive good news.' 'The last information was about 5 months ago, something like that,' he shared. 'We don't even have a list, we don't even have a Red Cross. While we're bringing aid trucks in there.' 'We should have blown the deal at the first violation,' Mor asserted. 'It seems to me that the three hostages will be released on Saturday, and then why would Israel break the deal? No. I think Hamas doesn't want to get too involved with Trump, he's driving us crazy and he'll do what's necessary in the end.' Mor added, in light of U.S. President DonaldTrump's words regarding the ultimatum to Hamas: 'We missed the opportunity. We had to show Hamas that we are not suckers. Shut off the water, the trucks, everything, and have Hamas come after us. But we didn't do that. We postponed and waited for the uncle from America to tell us who was needed for us - so we lost our authority here.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkoggaktyl	2025-02-11T22:59:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/12/B1LlgRttyl/B1LlgRttyl_0_108_1080_608_0_small.jpg

Musk acknowledges $50 million in condoms weren't meant for Gaza	Head of US government efficiency department addressed for first time President Donald Trump's mistaken statement that contraceptives were sent to Hamas in Gaza, when they were actually procured for Mozambique as part of the fight against HIV; Since 1993, USAID has allocated more than $6 billion to aid Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza In an unusual press briefing in the Oval Office, billionaire Elon Musk, who heads the Office of Government Efficiency (DOGE), admitted that U.S. President Donald Trump was wrong when he said that his department had prevented the transfer of ' $50 million for condoms to the Gaza Strip,' apparently due to confusion between the Strip and the Gaza province in Mozambique, where the contraceptives were transferred as part of the fight against HIV. Musk became the first official in the Trump administration to admit a mistake on the issue, noting: 'We are moving fast, so we will make mistakes, but we'll also fix the mistakes very quickly.' At the same time, Musk said that 'I'm not sure we should be sending $50 million worth of condoms anywhere, frankly.' The billionaire entrepreneur made the remarks at an impromptu press conference in the Oval Office at the White House, to which he was invited at the last minute by Trump. Musk, who regularly posts dozens of posts every day on his X network about his work in the government, some humorous and some serious, was asked about the credibility of his words, saying while his young son sat on his shoulders that 'if the condoms went to Mozambique instead of Gaza, then fine, it's not so bad, but still, why are we doing this? I'm not sure that's something the American people would be happy about. That's an enormous number of condoms.' The embarrassment reached its peak after weeks of strong statements from White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt, who claimed in her first briefing that the department headed by Musk had identified a 'gross waste of public funds' in transferring the $50 million for condoms to Gaza. Trump was quick to echo the words, saying that they had 'turned condoms into bombs.' However, investigations conducted by media outlets in the U.S. and around the world did not support this version. The world's leading media outlets, including Reuters, CNN, the New York Times and the UK Times, found no evidence of funds being transferred to Gaza for contraceptives, and over time it became clear that the amount was actually transferred to the Gaza district of Mozambique, as part of an international effort to combat HIV. Dana Stroll, former assistant secretary of defense for Middle East affairs, noted that the April 2024 report showed that the funding included contraceptives in four regions, but the bulk of the budget was earmarked for Africa, and in particular Mozambique. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The embarrassing error occurred after the Government Efficiency Department headed by Musk began work to effectively close the U.S. aid agency USAID, which the new administration has described as wasteful and a 'bastion of radical liberals.' A Ynet investigation revealed that in October 2024 about $45 million was allocated to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to fund sexual and reproductive health programs among refugees in Gaza, including the distribution of contraceptives. However, there is no evidence that the entire amount was allocated for this purpose alone, and experts in the field believe that the claim that it was only condoms is 'puzzling' at best. 'A complex picture': The storm over USAID At the same time, those who oppose Musk's move to dismantle USAID say that the agency could be run more transparently and efficiently. Since 1993, the agency has allocated more than $6 billion to aid Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Some of it was allocated to Israeli organizations for projects that benefit health, education and economic development in the region - for example, programs at Sheba, Hadassah and Shaare Zedek hospitals that promoted medical services for Jews and Arabs, or to the Hapoel Katamon soccer club in Jerusalem, for a project of joint soccer games for Jewish and Arab girls. At Hadassah, for example, the agency funded a program of 'collaboration between Israeli and Palestinian mental health professionals to better serve children and adolescents suffering from trauma.' On the other hand, there are cases in which USAID funding has been transferred to organizations with a clear anti-Israel agenda, and even indirect ties to elements involved in terrorism. Thus, more than $2 million was transferred between 2013 and 2017 to the organization Juzoor for Health and Social Development, which organized meetings between Palestinian youth and convicted terrorists. Another example is the funding of $1.1 million between 2009 and 2012 to the organization Just Vision, which produced a documentary film called 'Boycott' in 2021, which criticizes American laws against the BDS movement. Since October 7, USAID has invested more than $1.2 billion in humanitarian development programs affecting the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza – nearly 4% of its total budget. 'Our commitment to the Palestinian people remains steadfast,' said Amy Tohill-Stoll, USAID’s mission director for the West Bank and Gaza. However, even Israeli organizations that have benefited from the agency’s generous funding acknowledge that the picture is complex. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkm4s3yf1g	2025-02-11T21:21:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/03/ByRmw30Oke/ByRmw30Oke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

North Korean state media on Wednesday denounced U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to take over Gaza and relocate Palestinians as ludicrous and accused Washington of extortion. The slim hopes of Palestinians for safety and peace are being crushed by the proposal, a commentary carried by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said, without directly naming Trump.

The commentary is aimed at Trump's shock announcement that the U.S. intends to remove Gaza residents and transform the war-ravaged territory into what the president billed as a 'Riviera of the Middle East'. The KCNA commentary also criticized the Trump administration over its calls to take over the Panama Canal and Greenland and its decision to change the name of the 'Gulf of Mexico' to the 'Gulf of America' Trump held unprecedented summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his first term and has touted their personal rapport.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ske11wikyjx	2025-02-11T19:44:52-08:00

Canada, fulfilling a promise made to U.S. President Donald Trump, on Tuesday appointed a senior intelligence official to the new post of fentanyl czar, saying he would coordinate the fight against smuggling of the drug.

Released hostage Eli Sharabi 'went through things the eye and the...	Eli Sharabi's brother, Sharon, reveals that he had no knowledge of the fight for his release and was freed 'at the last possible chance'; He predicts a long road to recovery for his brother but remains hopeful: 'He is a hero. Life is stronger than anything – we will build him a new future' After 491 days in Hamas captivity, Eli Sharabi has returned home. But for his brother, Sharon Sharabi, the fight is far from over. Alongside the overwhelming relief and joy of Eli’s release, Sharon continues his battle to bring back the body of their brother, Yossi Sharabi, who was also abducted alive from Kibbutz Be’eri on Oct. 7 but was later killed in Gaza. His remains are still being held by the Hamas terror group. In an interview with Ynet on Tuesday, Sharon described the first moment he embraced his brother after more than 16 months in captivity. He spoke of Eli’s harrowing ordeal, his difficult road to recovery, and the devastating reality that awaited him: the murders of his wife, Lian, and daughters, Yahel and Noya, in the October 7 massacre. Even before learning that Eli was on the latest list of freed hostages, Sharon traveled to Kfar Maccabiah, where families of hostages have been gathering. 'Just in case,' he said. 'I arrived on Friday, even though there was no certainty Eli would be released in this round.' The confirmation came unexpectedly. 'That evening, I was sitting at the Shabbat table when someone told me, ‘I’m so happy for you.’ I didn’t understand at first. Then she said, ‘Your brother is coming home.’ We jumped for joy – physically jumped. Of course, I didn’t sleep a minute that night.' Eli’s mother and sister, Osnat, were at Re’im military base, where the freed hostages first reunited with their families. They watched as Eli stepped out of a Hamas vehicle in Gaza, joining Red Cross teams alongside fellow hostages Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy. The images of them – thin, pale and struggling to walk – shook the entire nation. 'Eli was freed at the last possible moment,' Sharon said. Their first hug took place at Sheba Medical Center. 'I held him tight, crying with joy and pain. I told him, ‘You’re home now. You’re safe. We’ll never leave you.’ I also whispered the prayer Shema Yisrael and thought of our mother, who could finally hold him again. It was the fulfillment of a life mission.' Surviving the unimaginable During his captivity, Eli was completely cut off from the outside world. 'He had no idea about the efforts to bring him home,' Sharon said. 'No radio, no television, no sunlight – not even fluorescent light. He was deep underground. He endured things the human eye and heart cannot comprehend.' Physically frail and mentally shaken, Eli faces a long recovery. 'He’s in a difficult state, but he will overcome this,' Sharon said. 'We’re mourning, but we will rise. Life is stronger than anything, and we will rebuild a future for him alongside the pain that will always remain. We won’t suppress the sorrow – we’ll learn to live with it.' Despite his suffering, Eli has shown nothing but gratitude. 'He walks around with an Israeli flag, thanking every person he meets. He keeps saying, ‘Thank you for saving my life. Thank you for fighting for me.’ People say I saved a life, but the real hero is Eli. His only wish now is to embrace bereaved families and wounded soldiers. That’s who he is — a true angel.' Eli, 51, was kidnapped from his home in Kibbutz Be’eri alongside his brother, Yossi, who was killed in captivity –likely due to an Israeli airstrike on a nearby building. While Eli was freed in the fifth round of hostage releases in the current hostage deal, Yossi’s body remains in Gaza. Sharon has led a relentless campaign to bring them both home. At the emotional reunion at Sheba Medical Center, he was seen draped in a prayer shawl, tears streaming down his face as he embraced Eli in prayer. A day after Eli’s release, Sharon issued a statement at the hospital, addressing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly. He reminded him of the 76 hostages still in Hamas captivity and urged him to make 'brave decisions.' Quoting the biblical plea, ‘Am I my brother’s keeper?’ Sharon emphasized, 'Every passing second could mean saving a life from Hamas tunnels.' He expressed gratitude to Netanyahu for fulfilling his promise to bring Eli home alive but stressed that 'the mission is far from over.' Sharon also called on the Israeli public: 'Keep raising your voices – you are the hope of all the hostages. At this moment, we must remember our soldiers. Eli is overwhelmed with gratitude and wants to hug every single one of you. You are our light. We have no other country, and you defend it with courage. On Eli’s behalf, I say: This struggle has touched every hostage. Eli himself is living proof of the urgent need to bring them all home – immediately.' Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, a senior Health Ministry official, commented on the conditions of Eli and the two other freed hostages, Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy. She noted that the signs of starvation, humiliation and harsh captivity are impossible to hide. For Eli Sharabi, his release is just the beginning of a long journey toward healing. For his family, the fight continues —to recover what was lost and to ensure that no hostage is left behind.. marks of prolonged suffering – perhaps even more visibly than those freed in previous rounds. For Eli Sharabi, his release is just the beginning of a long journey toward healing.

Trump to order US agencies to plan for 'large scale' staff cuts	U.S. President Donald Trump plans to direct federal agencies to coordinate with Elon Musk's task force to shrink the workforce and limit hiring with an exception to immigration and other safety positions, a White House official said on Tuesday. The executive order, which is expected to be signed on Tuesday, would set rules allowing government agencies to hire no more than one employee for every four workers who leave the federal workforce, according to the official. Additionally, the order will direct agencies to plan 'for large-scale reductions in force and determine which agency components (or agencies themselves) may be eliminated or combined because their functions aren't required by law,' the order will say, the official said. Federal employees whose work is 'critical to national security, public safety, law enforcement and immigration enforcement' would be exempted, the official added.

Hamas senior officials ordered to disconnect phones and hide as c...	Saudi report says the terror group ordered its senior figures to stop using their mobile phones 'to prevent them from being attacked,' and to go into hiding; Unnamed sources told the Arabic-language newspaper that the order, originally set for the end of Phase I of the cease-fire, was brought forward due to fears of an Israeli move as deal collapses Sources in the Hamas terrorist organization claimed Tuesday in an interview with the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat, which is published in London in Arabic, that the intelligence service of Hamas' military wing and the senior leadership ordered the organization's political and military leaders to stop using mobile phones and to physically hide, 'to prevent them from being tracked,' according to the report. This dramatic report comes in the shadow of the crisis in the cease-fire and the hostage return deal, in the midst of Phase 1 - and against the backdrop of Hamas' announcement that it will 'delay release steps until further notice,' despite the clarification that this is only a warning message at this stage. According to the sources, these guidelines were supposed to come into effect at the end of Phase I of the cease-fire, but were brought forward due to 'fear of Israeli treachery,' according to the guidelines, apparently referring to the statements from Israel in recent hours about the possibility of a return to fighting if the hostages are not released by Saturday afternoon. According to the report, many of the terrorist organization's senior figures returned to using their phones when the cease-fire began, about three and a half weeks ago. The sources added that some leaders have already begun implementing the new security measures, although at this stage it is only a warning, which came following Hamas' decision to suspend the release of the hostages. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In light of the crisis, the IDF announced additional reinforcements in the Southern Command , including the mobilization of reservists, following Netanyahu's ultimatum to Hamas regarding a possible return to fighting. The scope of the reinforcements is two to three battalions at this stage, despite the firm statements about a 'return to intense fighting.' Two divisions are currently operating in the southern region to defend the region, with the deployment including ground forces, the Air Force and the Navy. Since Monday night, regular forces, including special units, have been transferred to the south, and additional brigades have been deployed as a reserve force.

The reinforcements come following the cabinet's decision to halt negotiations on Phase II of the cease-fire and hostage release deal, claiming that Hamas had violated the agreement. According to a political source, Israel expects Hamas to release the nine living hostages as part of Phase 1 of the deal 'in the coming days.' As of now, there has been no change in the instructions for the home front, except for the cancellation of a KKL tree-planting event for the families of soldiers who have fallen in the current war that had been planned in the area for Tuesday. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj6va7yy1g	2025-02-11T11:22:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/B1ASl2VYkl/B1ASl2VYkl_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser, said the U.S. and Russia 'negotiated an exchange' to ensure Fogel's release. He did not say what the U.S. side of the bargain entailed. Previous negotiations have occasionally involved reciprocal releases of Russians by the U.S. or its allies.

Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani referenced remarks made by Trump in interviews with the New York Post and Fox News, in which he spoke of a preference to do a deal to stop Tehran getting a nuclear weapon over bombing the country. 'These reckless and inflammatory statements flagrantly violate international law and the U.N. Charter,' Iravani wrote to the 15-member council. 'The Islamic Republic of Iran warns that any act of aggression will have severe consequences, for which the U.S. will bear full responsibility,' he said. 'Iran will resolutely defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national interests against any hostile action.' Trump last week restored his 'maximum pressure' campaign on Iran that includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero in order to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. He also said he was open to a deal and expressed a willingness to talk to Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian. Iravani urged the U.N. Security Council to condemn Trump's 'brazen rhetoric.' Iran has denied wanting to develop a nuclear weapon. However, it is 'dramatically' accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% weapons-grade level, the U.N. nuclear watchdog chief told Reuters in December.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjxbextyye	2025-02-11T10:24:34-08:00

'The Palestinians will live safely somewhere other than Gaza,' the U.S. president said in a joint appearance before reporters. 'I think there will be parcels of land in Jordan and Egypt where Palestinians will live,' Trump also said. 'We will reach an agreement, I believe 99% that we can reach an understanding with Egypt as well.' Trump then issued a veiled threat saying that the U.S. 'contributes a lot of money to Jordan and Egypt.' Trump added that the United States 'will run Gaza very well' and that it would not purchase it. 'We're going to take it. We're going to hold it, we're going to cherish it. We're going to get it going eventually, where a lot of jobs are going to be created for the people in the Middle East,' Trump said of Gaza, saying his plan would 'bring peace' to the region. Trump added that he will not personally oversee any of his own developments there. 'There will be economic development there that has never been there, and we will make sure that there is peace and there are no problems,' Trump said. The U.S. president noted that the Palestinians want to stay in Gaza only because 'they have no alternative,' adding: 'They are being murdered there. There is no more dangerous place in the world than the Gaza Strip. No one wants to stay there. It is a death trap.' The King of Jordan said that he believes there was a way to 'achieve peace and prosperity in the region,' adding: 'We will support Trump to achieve these goals.' Regarding the absorption of Gazans in his country, he said that it should be in everyone's interest, noting that Jordan would absorb 2,000 sick children, and suggested waiting until the Egyptians come to present their plan to the president. He was later asked if there would be areas in Jordan where Gazans could live, and he replied that he would do 'what is best' for his country. Regarding the hostage deal , which is currently in crisis, Trump was asked if Saturday was still the deadline for Hamas to release Israeli, and he replied: 'Yes.'

He added that at that time he would be the 'owner' (of Gaza), saying: 'Think of it as a real estate development project for the future. It will be a beautiful piece of land.'

Hell worse than what we have already?': Gazans respond to Trump'...	Palestinians in Gaza reject Donald Trump’s plan to resettle Gaza’s population and redevelop it under US control; Critics call it an attempt to erase Palestinian identity With his Gaza home destroyed in Israel's military offensive, Shaban Shaqaleh had intended to take his family on a break to Egypt once the Hamas-Israel cease-fire was firmly in place. He changed his mind after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to resettle Gaza's Palestinian residents and redevelop the enclave, and said they should not have the right to return. The Tel Al-Hawa neighborhood in Gaza City, where dozens of multi-story buildings once stood, is now largely deserted. There is no running water or electricity and, like most buildings there, Shaqaleh's home is in ruins. 'We are horrified by the destruction, the repeated displacement and the death, and I wanted to leave so I can secure a safe and better future for my children - until Trump said what he said,' Shaqaleh, 47, told Reuters via a chat app. 'After Trump's remarks, I canceled the idea. I fear leaving and never being able to come back. This is my homeland,' he also said. Under Trump's scheme, Gaza's about 2.2 million Palestinians would be resettled and the United States would take control and ownership of the coastal territory, redeveloping it into what Trump has called the 'Riviera of the Middle East.' 'The idea of selling my home or the piece of land I own to foreign companies to leave the homeland and never come back is completely rejected. I am deeply rooted in the soil of my homeland and will always be,' Shaqaleh said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Any suggestion that Palestinians leave Gaza - which they want to be part of an independent state also encompassing the West Bank with East Jerusalem as its capital - has been anathema to the Palestinian leadership for generations. Neighboring Arab states have rejected it since the Gaza war began in 2023. After Hamas said on Monday it was suspending the release of Israeli hostages set out in the cease-fire deal due to alleged Israeli violations, Trump said the Palestinian terror group should release all those it still holds by noon on Saturday or he would propose canceling the truce and 'let hell break out.' 'Hell worse than what we have already? Hell worse than killing?' said Jomaa Abu Kosh, a Palestinian from Rafah in southern Gaza, standing beside devastated homes. One woman, Samira Al-Sabea, accused Israel of blocking aid deliveries, a charge denied by Israel. 'We are humiliated, street dogs are living a better life than us,' she said. 'And Trump wants to make Gaza hell? This will never happen.' Some Gazans said Palestinian leaders must find a solution to their problems. 'We don't want to leave our country but we also need a solution. Our leaders - Hamas, the PA (Palestinian Authority), and other factions - must find a solution,' said a 40-year-old carpenter who gave his name as Jehad. 'Does he own Gaza?' In the West Bank, Palestinians were also aghast at Trump's words. 'Does he own Gaza to ask people to leave it?' said Nader Imam. 'Regarding Trump, I only blame the American people. How can a country like this, a superpower, accept a person like Trump? His statements are savage.' 'What will Trump do? There is no fear, we rely on God,' said another West Bank resident, Mohammed Salah Tamimi. The proposal shattered decades of U.S. peace efforts built around a two-state solution and added pressure on neighboring Egypt and Jordan to take in resettled Palestinians. Both countries, which receive billions in aid from the United States, rejected the plan citing concerns for national security and their commitment to the two-state solution. For Jordan, which borders the West Bank and has absorbed more Palestinians than any other state since Israel's creation, the plan is a nightmare. Trump said he might withhold aid to Jordan and Egypt if they refused to cooperate.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he did not think Hamas will make a Saturday deadline to release all hostages, putting a Gaza cease-fire deal in jeopardy.

Houthi leader threatens to resume attacks on Israel if Gaza cease...	Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, leader of the Iran-backed militia responsible for more than 300 attacks on Israel, warned that his forces are 'ready to launch strikes on Israel if it resumes operations in Gaza' Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, leader of the Iran-backed militia in Yemen, warned Tuesday that his group is prepared to launch attacks on Israel if it resumes military operations in Gaza and violates the cease-fire agreement. 'If the occupation escalates, we will stand with the Lebanese people,' al-Houthi said in an interview in Yemen. 'We reaffirm our commitment to supporting the Palestinian people – militarily, politically and in public advocacy. We are ready for military intervention if Israel intensifies its aggression against Gaza.' He added that 'Israelis must understand that no matter how much they rely on the Americans, they will not achieve their goals if they choose escalation. The Israeli enemy is delaying the implementation of the second phase of the agreement. If they escalate, they will be met with determination and resilience from the Palestinian people. The Houthis, backed by Iran, have launched more than 300 attacks on Israel since Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault, as well as disrupted maritime traffic in the Red Sea. About a month into the war, they claimed responsibility for hijacking the Galaxy Leader, a cargo ship they said was Israeli-linked, seizing its 22 crew members. Three weeks ago, the group announced their release – more than a year after their capture. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Positioning themselves as a frontline force 'defending Gaza,' the Houthis insisted that the ship’s release was contingent on Hamas' approval, relaying this stance to mediators. Following the enforcement of the Gaza cease-fire, the group declared they would 'limit' Red Sea attacks to vessels with Israeli ties. In the lead-up to the cease-fire and hostage deal, Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree softened his usual rhetoric. Instead of pledging continued military action until Israel lifts the blockade on Gaza, he vowed that the group 'will not abandon Palestine or its just cause until every inch is liberated and the Israeli enemy is expelled.' US declares Houthis a terrorist organization Three weeks ago, the White House announced that former President Donald Trump had signed an executive order designating the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization. The move reinstated severe U.S. sanctions that had been lifted by President Joe Biden’s administration in 2021. Last year, the Biden administration reclassified the Houthis as a 'Specially Designated Global Terrorist' group after the president condemned their attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea. However, they were not placed back on the formal list of foreign terrorist organizations—until the latest White House decision. The updated designation, which had been under review for months by Biden officials but was ultimately signed by Trump, imposes stricter penalties, including automatic sanctions on anyone providing support to the Houthis. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkevyxfykg	2025-02-11T08:01:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/07/rkWprNk8T/rkWprNk8T_0_50_1000_563_0_small.jpg
UAE proposes Sudan cease-fire; army rejects call	The United Arab Emirates called on Tuesday for a cease-fire in Sudan during the coming holy month of Ramadan, a UAE official said, a call rejected by the Sudanese army, as the country's civil war approaches the two-year mark. The army considers the UAE to be an aggressor of the war, accusing it of arming the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, accusations U.N. experts and U.S. lawmakers have said are credible. The UAE denies these charges. The war in Sudan has created the world's largest humanitarian catastrophe, with more than 12 million people displaced, half the population hungry, and increasing fragmentation of the impoverished country. 'As we approach the holy month of Ramadan, a time of mercy and compassion, the UAE calls on all parties to honor this sacred period with a humanitarian cease-fire,' the UAE official said. 'We do not accept a Ramadan cease-fire until the siege is broken on all cities and areas that are besieged,' a high-level army source told Reuters when asked for comment. The RSF is currently engaged in an assault on the city of al-Fashir, the army's last remaining stronghold in the Darfur region, as it loses ground to the army in the capital Khartoum.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hynfj11yyjg	2025-02-11T07:48:35-08:00

In 1st for Italy, Tuscany approves right-to-die law	Tuscany approved on Tuesday a right-to-die law, becoming the first region in Roman Catholic Italy to regulate assisted suicide in the absence of national legislation on a highly controversial topic. Italy's constitutional court de-facto legalized the procedure in 2019, and urged parliament to pass a law to provide a clear legal framework. But the invitation has gone unheeded, with national politicians ducking the issue. Tuscany's regional law, which passed by a 27-13 majority, spells out how assisted suicide requests should be handled, including an obligation for a medical panel to consider applications within 30 days. If the criteria are met, the regional health service must provide the necessary medication and health care personnel within 10 days, unless the patient wants his own doctor to carry out the procedure. The law allows doctors to refuse to participate on moral or ethical grounds - similar to what is already allowed by national legislation on abortion for so-called conscientious objectors. Switzerland has allowed assisted suicide since the 1940s.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjinrefkjl	2025-02-11T07:44:51-08:00	
Cabinet says ready to continue with cease-fire deal, supports Tru...	Government ministers met for 4 hours to discuss developments in negotiations on the deal in wake of Hamas announcement it would stop releasing hostages and US president's ultimatum; 'The entire cabinet supports Trump's revolutionary vision' The political-security cabinet met Tuesday for four hours for a discussion following Hamas' announcement that it would 'suspend the release of hostages,' and against the backdrop of U.S. President Donald Trump's advice to resume fighting if 'all the hostages' are not released by Saturday at noon. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to issue a statement later Tuesday evening on the Israeli position following developments in the negotiations on the deal and the fear that the current crisis will lead to its collapse. A political source said after the cabinet meeting that all of its members expressed support for Trump's demand 'for the release of all the hostages by Saturday at noon and for his revolutionary vision for the future of Gaza.' Although Netanyahu landed in Israel from a visit to the U.S. on Sunday, amid fears that the deal would collapse, the cabinet was not scheduled to convene until Tuesday evening. 'The prime minister moved the cabinet meeting to the afternoon, brought forward due to Hamas' decision to violate the agreement,' the source said. 'Last night, the prime minister ordered the reinforcement of forces in and around the Gaza Strip, and to prepare for any scenario if Hamas does not release our hostages this coming Saturday,' the source added. 'The cabinet meeting lasted about four hours and was thorough and in-depth.' Although all the ministers expressed support for Trump's ultimatum, Israel actually decided to continue with the deal and not break the rules. Thus, if Hamas releases the three hostages who are supposed to be released on Saturday as part of the sixth round of releases, Israel will continue implementing the agreement from its perspective - it will release Palestinian prisoners and continue to bring humanitarian aid into Gaza. Prime Minister's spokesman Omer Dostri, meanwhile, addressed all ministers and instructed them: 'On behalf of the Prime Minister, I request that you not be interviewed on the subject of Gaza at this stage.' Even before the directive and shortly after the end of the discussion, Energy Minister Eli Cohen, a member of the cabinet, said that 'we adopt President Trump's words regarding the release of all the hostages and we adhere to them.' In an interview with 'Galei Israel,' Cohen said that 'anyone who thinks he can blackmail the State of Israel with such and such tricks - it will not happen.' According to him, 'we adhere to Trump's words regarding the release of all the hostages (by Saturday) and we adopt them. I see that they are actually saying that they will not abide by the agreement; This is already a violation of the deal.' The cabinet meeting in Jerusalem was delayed Tuesday morning due to the extension of the limited security consultation that Netanyahu had already held. The ministers discussed, among other things, Hamas' announcement to halt the release of the hostages, due to 'Israeli violations.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The New York Times reported Tueday, citing six Israeli sources familiar with the details of the negotiations and another source on behalf of the mediators, that the Israeli delegation, which left for Doha on Sunday and returned early Monday morning, was in fact a 'futile delegation.' According to the sources, the members of the delegation 'listened to the Qatari proposals, and announced that they must return to Israel so that its government can decide how to proceed.' Netanyahu actually delayed the discussions on Phase II of the cease-fire and hostage release deal, saying that he sees the talks on the deal he held in the U.S. on the 16th day of the first phase of a cease-fire with Steve Witkoff, Trump's envoy to the Middle East, as the start of the talks. Against this backdrop, the cabinet Tuesday also discussed the mandate that will be given to the Israeli delegation that will deal with Phase II, and Netanyahu was supposed to bring the Israeli conditions to approval within this framework. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1rvvxytkl	2025-02-11T07:28:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/17/rklMzZTvPJl/rklMzZTvPJl_0_134_1280_720_0_small.jpg
27 religious groups sue Trump administration to protect houses of...	More than two-dozen Christian and Jewish groups representing millions of Americans - ranging from the Episcopal Church and the Union for Reform Judaism to the Mennonites and Unitarian Universalists - filed a federal court lawsuit Tuesday challenging a Trump administration move giving immigration agents more leeway to make arrests at houses of worship. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, contends that the new policy is spreading fear of raids, thus lowering attendance at worship services and other valuable church programs. The result, says the suit, infringes on the groups' religious freedom -namely their ability to minister to migrants, including those in the United States illegally. 'We have immigrants, refugees, people who are documented and undocumented,' said the Most Rev. Sean Rowe, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1zobefy1l	2025-02-11T07:07:39-08:00

Novelist Rushdie takes stand in trial of his accused stabber	The novelist Salman Rushdie showed a jury his blinded right eye on Tuesday as he testified against the man charged with trying to murder him at a talk at a rural New York venue in 2022. Hadi Matar, 26, has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree attempted murder and second-degree assault brought by the Chautauqua County district attorney. Rushdie walked into the courtroom dressed in a dark suit, white shirt and gray tie. The right lens of his spectacles was blacked out, masking the eye, which his attacker's knife had pierced through to the optic nerve. Rushdie, who spent most of the 1990s in hiding in the UK after receiving death threats over his 1988 novel 'The Satanic Verses,' was stabbed about 15 times: in the head, neck, torso and left hand, blinding his right eye and damaging his liver and intestines. The trauma doctors who treated him after he was airlifted to a hospital in Erie, Pennsylvania, said he lost so much blood he came close to death. 'He struck me a number of times, another half a dozen times,' Rushdie replied. 'At some point I thought I was dying. That was my immediate thought.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjcvnxyy1e	2025-02-11T07:03:36-08:00

Egypt threatens Israel peace deal if U.S. aid stops	U.S. president threatens to halt billions in aid to Egypt and Jordan unless they agree to take in Gaza refugees under his plan; Egyptian president suspends White House meeting amid worse bilateral relations in decades The Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty may be invalid if U.S. President Donald Trump carries out his threats to end American aid to Egypt, diplomatic sources in Cairo said in an article to the Qatari Al Araby al-Jadeen newspaper on Tuesday. The sources said the planned meeting in Washington betwee Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Trump has been suspended indefinately amid the worse crisis in U.S.-Egypt relations in three decades and Cairo's rejection of Trump's plan to remove Palestinians from Gaza while he rebuilds the Strip and settle them in neighboring Arab countires. U.S. President Donald Trump's remarks late Monday threatening to halt American aid to Egypt and Jordan if they refuse to accept Palestinian refugees, mark a turning point in the Palestinian issue, linking it to the longstanding relationships these countries have with the U.S. In January, the Trump administration froze all international U.S. aid for 85 days for 'review,' but exempted Israel and Egypt due to the ongoing war. Other sources told Saudi television network Al-Arabiya that 'Egypt has decided to take precautions against any potential halt of U.S. aid and has prepared emergency plans to deal with U.S. pressure regarding the displacement issue.' Egypt, the third-largest recipient of U.S. aid after Israel and Jordan, would be heavily impacted if the aid is cut off. According to Al-Masry Al-Youm, U.S. aid to Egypt is estimated at $2.1 billion, including $815 million in economic aid, with the rest allocated for military aid. The outlet also noted that the U.S. has often used aid as leverage against Egypt. The London-based Arab outlet Asharq Al-Awsat said in an article that Egypt’s exemption from the aid freeze 'was tied to its central role in Middle East security and the peace agreement with Israel.' Experts cited by the paper affirmed that the exemption 'would certainly be appreciated by Egyptian authorities, strengthening regional cooperation.' However, these assumptions are now in question after Trump’s recent remarks. While Egypt and Israel were exempted from the freeze, U.S. aid to Jordan, which heavily relies on foreign aid, was suspended. U.S. assistance to Jordan, valued at $1.4 billion, is crucial for the country’s economy, funding development programs and maintaining stability. Prior to the freeze, Jordan was expected to receive $2.1 billion in U.S. aid by 2025. King Abdullah II of Jordan is scheduled to meet Trump in Washington later on Tuesday. A few days after the announcement of the suspension of aid, King Abdullah visited Brussels, where he signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement with the European Union. The agreement focuses on political, security, economic, trade, investment, and refugee issues and includes efforts to combat drug and arms smuggling into Jordan. Jordan and the U.S. share a long-standing relationship based on mutual interests, including cooperation on Islamic terrorism and international security. Jordan is a key U.S. ally, with American troops stationed there and U.S. weapons stored in the country. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Around 3,000 American soldiers are based in Jordan, operating under a secret agreement allowing access to 12 key Jordanian military bases. Jordan, not a NATO member, also conducts joint military training with other countries, including Israel. 'There have been crises in the past, both between Israel and Jordan and between Jordan and the U.S,' Prof. Ronen Yitzhak, head of the Middle East Studies department at the Western Galilee College and researcher at Tel Aviv University, said. 'After 1967, King Hussein claimed the U.S. was pro-Israel and didn’t pressure Israel to withdraw from the West Bank, but relations always remained behind the scenes.' Despite this, he stressed the strong anti-Western sentiment in Jordanian public opinion, which strongly supports Palestinians. A recent Jordanian nationwide poll expressed support for King Abdullah’s stance against 'the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza.' The king has backing from Arab states and popular support against Trump’s plan. 'Jordan sometimes pursues an independent policy, and Abdullah is not an American puppet,' Yitzhak Prof. added. 'The relationship between Jordan and the U.S. is not as it once was. There have been past tensions, such as after the Gulf War. What’s unclear now is Israel’s silence, as it should understand the implications of weakening Jordan’s government.' Yitzhak said he found it hard to believe Trump's threat would lead to aid completly being cut off. Both Egypt and Jordan have expressed opposition to the 'expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza' due to concerns over displaced people crossing into their territories. Egyptian officials said that 'any displacement would end the Palestinian issue,' while both Cairo and Amman have voiced support for a two-state solution and the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. These countries view the issue as fundamental and economic threats are unlikely to change their position, but may lead to renewed preparations and alternative funding solutions. If Trump’s threats are carried out, they could lead to new alliances in the region that may not favor Israel. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a recent visit that 'Arab countries support the Palestinians and reject Trump’s plan.' He stressed the importance of rebuilding Gaza while Palestinians remain there. An official from another Arab state told CNN anonymously that 'it’s still unclear' whether the U.S. is actively working on the details of the plan to move Gaza’s residents, noting that Arab officials will discuss Gaza’s future with Trump. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjvoqn00t1l	2025-02-11T04:23:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/SJMn3kMKyg/SJMn3kMKyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
IDF mulls permanent deployment in West Bank refugee camps	Prolonged presence aims to prevent terror cell rebuilding, with significant operational and political implications The IDF was considering deploying troops to refugee camps in and around the West Bank city of Tulkarm on a permanent or long-range basis, Ynet learned on Tuesday. As attention turns to the potential collapse of the ceasefire in Gaza, troops continued their sustained operation targeting terrorism within Palestinian refugee camps in the northern West Bank. The military's Central Command was evaluating the possibility of assigning a dedicated battalion to operate exclusively in the Tulkarm and Nur al-Shams refugee camps for several months. Discussions were also underway on the establishment of rapid deployment outposts in specific locations within the camps. The proposed battalion would focus on activity within the refugee camps with the aim to maintain a continuous and intensified operational presence, utilizing troops who are highly familiar with the geography of the camps and the networks of terror operatives operating there. In the past, IDF activity in the area was primarily intelligence-driven and dependent on the availability of battalions within the regional brigade. Such operations required varying levels of preparation and coordination at the brigade level. Should it be established, it would allow for a faster and more consistent response to emerging intelligence or terror threats within the camps. A sustained presence throughout most of the day would disrupt terror organizations' ability to regroup and rebuild their infrastructure. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: A security official explained recently that after about a month of reduced IDF activity in Jenin—due to the involvement of Palestinian security forces—terror organizations managed to rebuild certain capabilities that had been dismantled during earlier operations. To prevent the rehabilitation of these networks, IDF is working on solutions to maintain a long-term presence in the camps. During the current operation, IDF troops have established barriers and checkpoints on the outskirts of the refugee camps, prompting residents to leave the camps. Most of the population has been evacuated, causing large traffic jams across the West Bank due to checkpoints at the entrances and exits of villages. If the 'Tulkarm Model' is implemented, IDF troops would be expected to remain stationed in the two adjacent refugee camps on a permanent basis at least in the coming months. Such a decision would carry significant operational, political, and civilian implications. 'IDF troops have been conducting operations in the northern West Bank as part of this sustained effort for several weeks. The activity will continue as long as required,' the IDF said in a statement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjs6p2ok1e	2025-02-11T04:06:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/H1lb925Pt1x/H1lb925Pt1x_1_60_1601_901_0_small.jpg

Government tells Supreme Court It's 'too soon' for October 7 inqu...	After families of fallen, captive ask court to compell Netanyahu to establish a National commission of Inquiry, ministers decides to postpone decision on probe into failings leading to October 7 massacre, for three months The government told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that it was too soon to launch an inquiry into the failings that led to the October 7 massacre by Hamas. Adv. Michael Ravilo acting as the private lawyer for the government informed the court that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has directed the cabinet to re-evaluate the decision to establish a National Commission of Inquiry in three months time. 'A significant majority of members of the government believe the time is not yet appropriate to form such a commission,' Ravilio said in response to a petition demanding the immediate establishment of the commission, by the families of murdered and abducted victims of the attack. In his statement Ravilo said that the ministers and Netanyahu spend three and a half hours discussing the matter on Sunday. 'According to the Cabinet Secretary, a majority of ministers agreed that the ongoing state of war makes this the wrong time to form a commission.' He said different proposals were considered on how to investigate the events that led to the massacre when the war ends, during the meeting. 'The prime minister, however, instructed the Cabinet to reconvene in 90 days to revisit the issue.' The discussion comes after the Supreme Court imposed a deadline two months ago requiring the government to act. During the recent session, tempers flared as several ministers criticized Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara. Netanyahu voiced his strong opposition to the immediate formation of a National Commision of Inquiry. 'We cannot claim the war is over. We cannot afford to divert critical personnel from their responsibilities to focus on legal proceedings while Israel faces immense challenges,' he said. Concerns over personal accountability have fueled Netanyahu’s resistance, with fears that commission would place the blame for failures squarely on his shoulders. Most ministers sided with Netanyahu. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Attorney General questioned why the opinion of Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar had not been shared with ministers after he sent a letter outlining his insistance the the establishment of the commision is urgently needed and after he was barred from participating in the cabinet meeting.

What authority does he have to offer an opinion without being asked, and when it isn’t even related to him?' Bereaved families demand accountability Liad Baram, father of Staff Sergeant Itay Baram, who was killed in battle on October 7, expressed frustration in an interview with Ynet: 'I don’t understand why the state won’t commit to its people, to itself, to the bereaved families, to the hostages, to everyone. Why won’t they promise to establish this? It’s for us—not for external purposes. To this day, we haven’t received answers about what happened. Everything we know comes from our own investigation—conversations with Itay’s friends and commanders. The state hasn’t provided any answers. As a citizen and a bereaved father, I deserve an explanation for what led to this tragedy.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1uoosdtkx	2025-02-11T03:41:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/20/SymgqaoGkl/SymgqaoGkl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Sweden says arrested Islamist extrimist preparig terror attack	Suspect also suspected of aggravated participation in a terrorist organisation, preparation for attempted murder and preparing to violate legislation on the use of explosives, police says; Stokholm court convicts Swedish IS member of genocide, war crimes Swedish police said on Tuesday they had apprehended one person in the Stockholm area on suspicion of preparing terrorist crimes in a case concerning violent Islamist extremism. The person was suspected of preparation for a terrorist offence, aggravated participation in a terrorist organisation, preparation for attempted murder and preparing to violate legislation on the use of explosives, police said. The investigation was not linked to any previously ongoing cases, police said in a statement. Police conducted the operation in the capital area on Tuesday morning and the arrest unfolded calmly, they added, without identifying the suspect or giving detail on the potential target. In 2023, Sweden raised its terrorism alert to the second-highest level and warned of threats against Swedes at home and abroad after public burnings of the Muslim holy book, the Koran, outraged Muslims and triggered threats from jihadists. Also on Tuesday a court in Stockholm convicted a Swedish woman of genocide, crimes against humanity and gross war crimes committed in Syria in 2015 against women and children of the Yazidi religious minority, sentencing her to 12 years in prison. The woman, identified as 52-year-old Iraqi born, Lina Ishaq, returned to Sweden in 2020 and is currently serving time for other offences committed in Syria. 'The crimes constitute an exceptionally serious violation, not only of the life and integrity of specific individuals but also of fundamental human values and humanity,' Stockholm's district court said in its verdict on Tuesday.

Pope Francis sharply criticized U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown in an unusual open letter sent to America's Catholic bishops on Tuesday. The pope, who earlier called Trump's plan to millions of migrants a 'disgrace', said it was wrong to assume that all undocumented immigrants were criminals. 'I exhort all the faithful of the Catholic Church ... not to give in to narratives that discriminate against and cause unnecessary suffering to our migrant and refugee brothers and sisters,' said the pontiff.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy5uhnotke	2025-02-11T03:03:01-08:00

Cease-fire faces collapse, what Hamas claims and Israel's respons...	Hamas military spokesperson accuses Israel of delaying the return of displaced Gazans, continuing operations in the Strip and blocking humanitarian aid; Israeli officials dismissed claims as baseless Hamas on Monday announced it would delay the release of hostages 'until further notice,' citing Israeli violations of the cease-fire agreement. The move threatens the cease-fire and the release of 17 remaining hostages in the first phase of the deal. The terror group demanded Israel 'compensate' it for recent events and said the delay would remain in effect until Israel recommits to the agreement. Hamas military spokesman Abu Obaida outlined the alleged violations: 'Delays in allowing displaced persons to return to northern Gaza, gunfire and shelling in various areas and failure to deliver agreed-upon aid, while we have upheld all our commitments.' Israeli officials rejected the claims, saying, 'They were reviewed and found baseless.' Hamas accused Israel of preventing northern Gaza residents from returning home on the agreement’s seventh day. According to the deal, the IDF was to withdraw from the coastal road and dismantle military installations, but the retreat was delayed by two days. Israeli forces had postponed their withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor after Hamas failed to release civilian hostage Arbel Yehud in the second hostage release round. Instead, Hamas freed four female IDF lookouts, prompting a temporary hold on civilian movement. After the issue was resolved, Gaza residents were seen crossing the road and returning north. Hamas later declared, 'The return of the displaced is a victory for our people and proof of the failure of Israel’s plans.' Hamas also accused Israel of continuing military operations throughout Gaza, despite the cease-fire agreement mandating a 'temporary pause in military activity' and an IDF pullback from populated areas along the border. The terror group claimed Israeli forces continued to engage, sometimes firing at civilians or terrorists. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF responded that its actions were in line with the agreement. 'Troops fired warning shots to deter individuals approaching forces operating in various areas,' a military statement read. 'The IDF remains committed to the deal to secure the return of hostages and will take necessary measures against immediate threats.' Hamas repeatedly claimed Israel violated the humanitarian provisions of the deal. The group terror argued that too few aid trucks had entered Gaza, citing a shortfall of 3,500 trucks from the agreed-upon 12,000. Hamas-affiliated media also reported shortages of 35 fuel trucks per day and 180,000 tents. Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) rejected Hamas's allegations, saying, 'All agreed-upon aid trucks have entered Gaza. Over 600 aid trucks crossed through Kerem Shalom, Erez and the 147 crossing near Kissufim.' Regarding caravans that have not yet been delivered, Israeli officials clarified that their supply is the responsibility of mediators. 'There are no trucks waiting for our approval at the Kerem Shalom and Erez crossings or in Egypt,' a statement read. 'The mediators have yet to send them, so this does not stand as an Israeli violation.' Ynet’s military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai reported that Hamas leadership was unfazed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to 'let all hell break out' should the hostages not be released, as any repercussions would primarily affect mediators like Egypt, Qatar and Jordan. If Trump follows through on his warnings and lets ‘all hell break out,' as he put it, the mediators will bear the cost. While Hamas was unlikely to be directly impacted, the humanitarian aid flow — largely funded by Arab nations — could be affected. Pressure on Hamas’s leadership abroad could lead to renewed hostage releases if Israel agrees to certain aid concessions. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syh0hsofje	2025-02-11T02:37:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/Byb18ziwFkl/Byb18ziwFkl_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

A Hamas official said on Tuesday Israeli hostages can be brought home from Gaza only if a fragile cease-fire is respected, dismissing the 'language of threats' after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would 'let hell break out' if they were not freed.

Security Cabinet meets amid Hamas threat, Trump’s ultimatum	Ministers convene as Hamas halts hostage releases, citing alleged Israeli violations; families of hostages protest, demanding swift negotiations; Netanyahu faces increasing criticism from hostage families for delays, while Hamas dismisses Trump's ultimatum The security cabinet convened on Tuesday morning in Jerusalem to discuss Israel's position ahead of negotiations for the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was expected to present his conditions for the deal to continue. Earlier on Tuesday, the IDF announced that Shlomo Mansour who was 85-years old, the oldest among those abducted during the Hamas massacre was murdered on Oct. 7 and his body was being held in Gaza. The meeting came afte Hamas said in a statement that it would halt the release of hostages due to alleged Israeli violations. After U.S. President Donald Trump said Israel should resume its war in Gaza if all the hostages were not freed by mid-day Saturday, a Hamas official told Reuters that all parties to the cease-fire deal must respect their commitments. 'That is the only way to return the ‘prisoners’ (hostages).' He daid adding that threats would not help and would only 'complicate matters.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said ahead of the meeting that he intends to call on the cabinet to issue an ultimatum to Hamas in response to Trump’s remarks. He suggested measures such as cutting off the supply of water and electricity while 'opening the gates of hell' on the organization. 'We need to re-arrest released terrorists and announce that if anything happens to our hostages, we will impose sovereignty on an additional 5% of Gaza. We have international backing for this,' Smotrich said Speaking at a conference on integrating ultra-Othodox men into the military, Smotrich said. 'They care only about land. We must issue an ultimatum, gather Gaza’s residents in one place, maintain minimal control, and relocate them elsewhere. Trump’s plan is not just a slogan—that’s what I’ll tell the cabinet. No Hamas in Gaza means no enemies, no threats to Israel. The territory will once again become part of Israel, because it is ours and because it ensures the nation’s security.' Protests and families’ demands Ahead of the cabinet meeting, families of hostages and activists advocating for the full implementation of the agreement blocked Route 1 Israel's main highway from the coast to Jerusalem and later continued to demonstrate inside the capital. Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan was held captive in Gaza called on the prime minister to 'stop sabotaging the agreement and send a delegation to Doha with a full mandate to negotiate the next phase, which must lead to the simultaneous release of all remaining hostages.' 'Netanyahu dragged this agreement out for months. It’s now clear he is acting out of political considerations, dragging his feet, refusing to send a delegation to the negotiations, boasting, and doing everything to sabotage the agreement,' the protesters said. 'We’ve heard the latest testimonies—our loved ones are enduring hell in captivity and won’t survive there much longer. We demand that Netanyahu grant full authority to the negotiation team, commit to fully implementing the agreement, shorten the timeline, and bring everyone back at once. Get them out of hell.' Hostage families’ frustration Danny Algert, brother of hostage Itzik Algert, who was released in the first phase of the deal, addressed Trump’s ultimatum in an interview with Ynet. 'Terror organizations are the ones issuing ultimatums. Hamas has a strategic weapon—it’s called hostages—and they will exploit this card to the very end.' He said he knew that Netanyahu would not fully committ to the deal and would sabotage it. 'The announcement came from Hamas, but it was Netanyahu who dismantled the negotiation team, letting politicians interfere. He doesn’t want to proceed to the second phase.' Algert further criticized Netanyahu: 'He returned from the U.S. arrogant and out of touch, after enjoying luxury hotels with Elon Musk. He doesn’t understand the atmosphere here in the country. In the Knesset, he cynically announced that he wouldn’t continue the deal. This culture of power, money, and honor—now amplified with Trump—will ultimately lead to the death of these hostages.' A father’s perspective Rubi Chen, father of Staff Sgt. Itay Chen, who was killed in combat on October 7 and whose body is held in Gaza, also commented on Trump’s remarks. In an interview with Ynet, he said: 'Trump has been using phrases like ‘hell will break loose’ for a while. Last week, during my visit to the U.S., his team tried to clarify this, but it remains vague. I think part of what Trump is saying reflects an understanding that negotiations for the release of the last hostage must be accelerated.' Chen believes that Hamas will not release all the hostages without an end to the war. 'There’s only one alternative—a deal. The Israeli government had 16 months to reach a better agreement, but this is what we have. We’ve seen the condition of the released hostages, and as for the fallen, we may not even find them anymore.' He added: 'The main leverage we have right now is ending the war. Families of the fallen are also under immense pressure. The leverage being explained to us by the negotiation team is essentially Gaza’s reconstruction, and that’s already happening. It reminds me of what was said to the Goldin and Shaul families a decade ago—and we saw how that turned out.' The humanitarian toll Carmit Yitzhaki, aunt of Eden Yerushalmi, who was killed in captivity, responded to comments made during a Knesset debate between Netanyahu and opposition leader Yair Lapid regarding Eden’s physical condition at the time of her death. In an interview with Ynet, she said: 'Hearing about Eden’s weight again—when she was 5'5' and weighed only 80 lbs.—it’s horrifying. Every time, it shocks me anew.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I can’t believe no one knew about the inhumane conditions they endured. It’s hard to believe no one knew they were being starved. Everyone knows they aren’t in hotels—they’re in the hands of the cruelest enemy. I saw the last release and was appalled, but not surprised—skin and bones.' She continued: 'I believe the prime minister was shocked. No human being wouldn’t be. They looked terrible. If we had missed them by just a few days or weeks, they wouldn’t still be with us. We need to act quickly. We’re dealing with a cruel enemy, and I hope those responsible find a solution. It’s time to move to the second phase and bring everyone home. I hope Eden and the five hostages who were with her are the last to be murdered by Hamas.' Gaza: The Singapore\Haiti fulcrum Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador-designate to Israel, said in an interview with Fox News: 'Gaza could have been Singapore, but Hamas turned it into Haiti. Hamas will not be able to continue existing in Gaza in the future. It’s a done deal.' He reminded viewers that 'Gaza was once a place where both Jews and Palestinians lived until 2005, when Ariel Sharon decided to give everything to the Palestinians. Israel evacuated 10,000 Jews from Gaza, turning it into a fully Palestinian state. The result was what we saw on October 7.' Huckabee concluded: 'We don’t know exactly what will happen in Gaza, but we know what could have happened: Gaza could have been Singapore. Instead, Hamas turned it into Haiti—or worse. The only time we had real peace in this region was during the four years Donald Trump was president. With his bold and innovative leadership, I’m optimistic we’ll see something transformative—perhaps of biblical proportions—in the Middle East.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkl0ucuy1e	2025-02-11T02:02:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/11/ByerB6FOtJg/ByerB6FOtJg_0_252_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Israel police arrests 28 pedophiles after undercover sting	Men suspected of sexual offenses against minors on Instagram and WhatsApp; 200 officers conduct raids, confiscating computers, mobile phones; 'I cannot stop thinking about you in every possible way,' one writes to cope posing as 13-year-old girl Israel Police said on Tuesday arrested 28 suspected pedophiles in a coordinated operation that included 200 officers in various locations around the country. The men were detained after a 2-month long undercover investigation of suspected sexual offenses against minors on Instagram and WhatsApp. Two female officers who identified online as 13-year-old girls corresponded with the suspects and received sexual content from them. The men allegedly initiated contact with the two agents and sent them photos and videos of a sexual nature, among other things. According to the police, they attempted to convince the agents to film themselves and send pictures, some even suggested a meeting with the '13-year old' girls. 'I fell in love with a cleaver 13-year-old with a pure soul. I cannot stop thinking about you in every possible way,' one of the suspects wrote. 'You have to stay in touch with me,' another wrote. 'You are important to me and I miss you.' On Tuesday, officers raided the homes of the suspects and collected evidence connecting them to the suspected offenses including computers and mobile phones. They were taken for questioning and my appear before court to be remanded, the police said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkzdui00f1l	2025-02-11T01:46:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/06/11/9300812/9300812_1_136_2000_1125_0_small.jpg
A group that needs to be eradicated': Rubio shocked at state of ...	U.S. Secretary of State calls terror group 'pure evil' in radio interview and reiterates Trump's promises to release all hostages and secure peace in Gaza U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned Hamas in a radio interview on Monday, calling them 'monstrous' and 'pure evil' while discussing the condition of three recently released Israeli hostages — Ohad Ben Ami, Eliyahu Sharabi and Or Levy. 'I don’t think there’s any coincidence in the schedule that they’re being released where they obviously released the ones they thought were in the best condition first, then over time you’re starting to see the impact of this,' Rubio said. 'It’s incredibly revealing about what we’re dealing with. This is an evil organization. Hamas is evil. It’s pure evil. These are monsters. These are savages. That’s a group that needs to be eradicated,' he added. Referring to the treatment of the hostages, Rubio said, 'You look at these images of what they – first of all, the humiliation that they have to go through. Just put aside for a moment the horrifying conditions they were kept and the horrifying things that happened to some of those hostages, on top of the fact that these were innocent civilians. 'I mean, none of these were soldiers. These are not combatants. These are just people that were abducted for purposes of being used as leverage. And they’re getting, what, 200 certified killers in exchange for one innocent hostage.' Rubio also pointed out the disparity between Hamas terrorists and the suffering in Gaza. 'Do any of those Hamas fighters look like they’ve been skipping meals? Do any of those Hamas fighters that you see look like they’ve been suffering over the last year and a half? Clearly, these people are – the ones suffering are the people from Gaza, but not them,' he said. 'If they still are the dominant power in Gaza when all this is done, there is not going to peace in the Middle East.' Call for regional involvement in Gaza's reconstruction Rubio addressed U.S. plans for post-war Gaza and urged regional countries to participate. ' Gaza is a place that, in addition to all the damage it suffered in the war – Hamas hides in the tunnels. It’s the civilians who they hide behind and underneath that have suffered the consequences of this,' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'But that’s a place where there’s all kinds of unexploded munitions and bombs that Hamas has, that’s been used in the conflict. Someone’s got to go in – for anybody to be able to live there, someone’s got to – you’ve got to clean it up. You’ve got to clean all that out of there even before you begin the process of removing rubble and debris and rebuilding housing, like permanent structures. Who’s going to do that?' He noted that U.S. President Donald Trump is the only leader so far who has committed to assisting in the endeavor. 'All these other leaders, they’re going to have to step up. If they’ve got a better idea, then now is the time. Now is the time for the other governments and other powers in the region, some of these very rich countries, to basically say, okay, we’ll do it. But we’re still waiting for more countries to step forward and say here’s what we’re willing to do. And right now, they’ve not been willing to do anything and – or at least anything concrete.' Opposition to a Palestinian state under Hamas or Hezbollah Speaking on the two-state solution, Rubio stressed that the issue is not Israel, but governance in Gaza. 'The big challenge for this whole two-state solution has not been Israel. It’s been: Who’s going to govern that second state? Who’s going to be in charge of it? If the people in charge of it are Hamas or Hizballah or anybody like that, these are groups that – whose goal is the destruction of the Jewish state.' he said. 'Why would any country in the world agree to create a second state on their border that is governed by armed elements who kidnap babies and murder babies and rape teenage girls and abduct innocents and whose stated goal and purpose for existing is your destruction?' Rubio reiterated Trump's vision for expanding peace agreements in the Middle East: ' Imagine a region where Israel now feels secure because of what’s happened in Lebanon and in Syria that they can enter into a peace deal with Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf kingdoms; a Sunni-Israeli peace deal akin to the Camp David Accords with Egypt and the peace with Jordan. President Trump has made very clear that part of his agenda is promoting peace in the world.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by5xxqofyg	2025-02-11T01:14:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/Bk8IE11rYJe/Bk8IE11rYJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Improvement noted, reforms required: Israel ranks 30th in Global ...	Israel still lags behind most Western nations; Transparency International warns corruption undermines efforts to combat climate change and democratic oversight mechanisms Slight, non-indicative improvement for Israel in the Global Corruption Index for 2024, ranking 30th in the world, (1st being the least corrupt, 180th the most corrupt) with a score of 64 on the 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), published this on Tuesday morning. This represents an improvement of three places compared to 2023, when Israel scored 62. The situation marks progress compared to 2021, when Israel was ranked 36th with a score of 59, approaching the 'red line' score of 50, below which countries are considered corrupt. Over the past decade, Israel's score has fluctuated between 59 and 64, with the same score of 64 recorded in 2016. The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), created by Transparency International, has been published annually since 1995 and ranks 180 countries. Its goal is to help businesses assess the level of corruption in countries where they consider conducting business. In Israel, the index is published by Transparency International Israel (Shvil), one of the organization’s 100 global branches. According to Transparency International Israel, the country’s score, which lags behind other Western nations, reflects, among other things, its failure to meet goals set to address the climate crisis. These include the anticipated failure to achieve the global target of carbon neutrality (Net Zero Emissions) by 2050, delays in implementing renewable energy targets, and general trends of corruption and weakening of democratic institutions and oversight mechanisms in the country. Transparency International Israel emphasized that the 2-point improvement in Israel's score on the 2024 index does not indicate a significant trend change and does not diminish the need to avoid harm to the judicial system and oversight mechanisms. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The least corrupt country in the world is Denmark, with a score of 90. It is followed by Finland (88), Singapore (84), New Zealand (83), Luxembourg (81), Norway (81), Switzerland (81), and Sweden (80). Other high-scoring countries include the Netherlands, Australia, Iceland, Ireland, Estonia, Uruguay, Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, Bhutan, Seychelles, Japan, and the United Kingdom. As noted, Israel is ranked 30th on the index, six places behind the United Arab Emirates and one place behind the United States. Countries ranked just below Israel include South Korea, Chile, and Lithuania. Slightly lower, with a score of 59, are Saudi Arabia and Qatar. At the bottom of the list is South Sudan, with a score of just 8, followed by Somalia, Venezuela, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Eritrea, Equatorial Guinea, Nicaragua, Sudan, and North Korea. Iran is near the bottom with a score of 23, slightly above Lebanon, which scored 22. Turkey is also in the lower part of the table with a score of 34, just ahead of Egypt, which scored 30. Transparency International (TI) warns: 'Addressing the climate crisis is one of the most significant global challenges for humanity. The world is at a critical juncture in its fight against climate change. Corruption exacerbates this struggle, and the international community must tackle the link between corruption and the climate crisis.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b100owddy1e	2025-02-10T23:22:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/ByZkFUKOye/ByZkFUKOye_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Trump to meet Jordan's King Abdullah II as he escalates pressure ...	Visit comes at a perilous moment for the ongoing cease-fire in Gaza as Hamas accuses Israel of violating the truce says it is pausing future release of hostages U.S. President Donald Trump will host Jordan’s King Abdullah II at the White House on Tuesday as he escalates pressure on the Arab nation to take in refugees from Gaza — perhaps permanently — as part of his audacious plan to remake the Middle East. The visit is happening at a perilous moment for the ongoing cease-fire in Gaza as Hamas, accusing Israel of violating the truce, has said it is pausing future releases of hostages and as Trump has called for Israel to resume fighting if all those remaining in captivity are not freed by this weekend. Trump has proposed the U.S. take control of Gaza and turn it into 'the Riviera of the Middle East,' with Palestinians in the war-torn territory pushed into neighboring nations with no right of return. He suggested on Monday that, if necessary, he would withhold U.S. funding from Jordan and Egypt, longtime U.S. allies and among the top recipients of its foreign aid, as a means of persuading them to accept additional Palestinians from Gaza. 'Yeah, maybe. Sure, why not?' Trump told reporters. 'If they don’t, I would conceivably withhold aid, yes.' Jordan is home to more than 2 million Palestinians and, along with other Arab states, has flatly rejected Trump’s plan to relocate civilians from Gaza. Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said last week that his country’s opposition to Trump’s idea was 'firm and unwavering.' In addition to concerns about jeopardizing the long-held goals of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Egypt and Jordan have privately raised security concerns about welcoming large numbers of additional refugees into their countries even temporarily. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: When asked how he’d persuade Abdullah to take in Palestinians, Trump told reporters, 'I do think he’ll take, and I think other countries will take also. They have good hearts.' The king is also meeting with top Trump administration officials during his visit, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. He is the third foreign leader to hold an in-person meeting with Trump since his January 20 inauguration. Trump announced his ideas for resettling Palestinians from Gaza and taking ownership of the territory for the U.S. during a press conference last week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump initially didn’t rule out deploying U.S. troops to help secure Gaza but at the same time insisted no U.S. funds would go to pay for the reconstruction of the territory, raising fundamental questions about the nature of his plan. After Trump’s initial comments, Rubio and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that Trump only wanted Palestinians relocated from Gaza 'temporarily' and sought an 'interim' period to allow for debris removal, the disposal of unexploded ordnance and reconstruction. But asked in an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier that aired Monday if Palestinians in Gaza would have a right to return to the territory under his plan, he replied, 'No, they wouldn’t.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sypged00kye	2025-02-10T22:53:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/11/H1VSH0000YJg/H1VSH0000YJg_540_26_1912_1076_0_small.jpg
Oldest hostage Shlomo Mansour, 86, murdered on Oct. 7, body abduc...	Kibbutz Kissufim and Mansour family informed by the military that based on intelligence gathered, they can confirm Shlomo was murdered during the massacre Shlomo Mansour, the oldest hostage held in Gaza was murdered during the Hamas massacre and his body was taken to Gaza by the terrorists, the IDF said on Tuesday. 'This is one of the hardest days in the history of our Kibbutz. Shlomo was for us more than a member of our community,' the kibbutz said in a statement. ' Mansour was a father, grandfather, true friend and the beating heart of our Kibbutz. His smile, humility and warmth were an inspiration to all of us. Our heats are broken over our failure to bring him back to us alive. The entire community is grieving our loss.' Hamas terrorists abducted Sholomo and his wife Mazal during the Oct. 7 massacre. Mazal managed to break away. Shlomo who was 85, weighing only 57 kilograms and without his hearing aids, was then kidnapped into Gaza in his own car.

Relatives say fear for the couple's lives following the return of living male hostages from Hamas captivity; 'we know how much danger they're in' Macabit Mayer, the aunt of Gali and Ziv Berman, the twins held captive by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, announced on Tuesday that the family had received a sign of life from the two but didn't provide further detail. 'We’re trying to regulate our breathing on one hand, but we know whose hands they're in and how much danger their lives are in,' she said. Gali and Ziv Berman, 27, from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, were abducted from their homes in the kibbutz. On October 7, Gali insisted on going to Emily Damaris’s home, who was alone and later returned to Israel in the hostage deal's first handout alongside Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher. Gali and Ziv were born, raised and worked together, with testimonies suggesting they were likely held separately in captivity.

This is the number 1 struggle for new immigrants	New olah Miriam Aviva Ross shares her Aliyah struggles and how one organization proved 'essential to my success' When Miriam Aviva Ross arrived in Israel a month and a half ago, she didn’t know a word of Hebrew. Navigating the country’s bureaucracy proved to be a real challenge, she told ILTV. Fortunately, she found support through Belong, an organization dedicated to helping new immigrants. 'Belong was hugely helpful in getting me in contact with the immigration authorities, translating documents so that I knew what I needed to fill out, what to bring, and even the staff offering to come to my appointments with me to translate in real time,' Ross said. She first heard about Belong from her brother, who had moved to Israel from the United States a few years earlier. When he learned that she was interested in making aliyah, he immediately connected her with the organization for support. 'You know you’re not just going to need help with one thing. It’s going to be a whole range of things,' Ross recalled her brother telling her. 'You’ll only really realize when you get here you’re not able to do everything.' Though thrilled to be in Israel, Ross acknowledged that the process of moving to a new country is challenging. 'So, Belong has honestly been essential to my success in establishing myself here,' she said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyp0apof1l	2025-02-10T21:33:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/11/Bk11Wk00dYJl/Bk11Wk00dYJl_0_9_537_303_0_small.jpg
Restoring trust in the IDF': Soldiers helping reconstruct Kibbut...	Troops from three units under the military's Technological and Logistics Directorate say they feel obligated to restore life to the kibbutz ravaged by Hamas on October 7 Following the release of hostages Ohad Ben Ami and Eliyahu (Eli) Sharabi from captivity in Gaza on Saturday, Kibbutz Be’eri has begun a long process of rebuilding after Hamas’ October 7 attack. Amid bullet-riddled walls and markings left by ZAKA emergency teams, three IDF units are working not only to restore structures but also to rebuild trust between the kibbutz and the army, which failed to protect it on October 7 — the day 101 Be’eri residents were killed, 31 kidnapped and entire neighborhoods burned to the ground. Initially met with skepticism, the teams from the IDF’s Technological and Logistics Directorate have since repaired over 40 buildings and kindergartens, becoming an integral part of the community. The effort began with a simple social media post by a member of Be’eri’s alert squad, seeking volunteers to help prepare temporary housing for displaced families in Kibbutz Hatzerim. The IDF division took notice and joined the initiative. 'The repairs aren’t just physical; they’re also about restoring trust in the IDF,' says Col. (res.) Kobi Dostkam, who oversees the project. 'For us, fixing the homes — some of which were damaged by IDF operations — is about taking responsibility. We treat this like a military mission, with morning and evening briefings.' When asked how the kibbutz members have responded to the troops’ aid, he says, 'they’ve welcomed us with open arms. At first, our presence wasn’t taken for granted, but over time, we fostered relationships and heard charged stories from October 7.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: One of the most sensitive tasks is repainting the markings left by ZAKA volunteers and soldiers, indicating searches and victim identification. 'We don’t erase anything hastily,' Dostkam says. 'Every decision is coordinated with the families and the kibbutz. There’s still a lot to do and we’ll keep working with complete dedication.' Ben Ami and Sharabi were among 29 residents kidnapped from Be’eri. Eighteen, including Ben Ami’s wife, Raz, were released in the first hostage deal back in November 2023. Three were recovered from Gaza for burial: Yehudit Waiss, Carmel Gat and Itay Svirsky. Now, with Ben Ami and Sharabi’s return to Israel in critical condition due to extreme malnutrition, the kibbutz awaits the release of Tal Shoham in the next phase of the deal, as well as the return of the bodies of Yossi Sharabi — Eli’s brother — and Sahar Baruch, who were murdered in captivity. The bodies of Ofra Keidar, Manny Godard, Ilan Weiss, and Dror Or are still being held by Hamas. 'We want returning residents — whether for good or just for a visit — to feel the place is coming back to life,' Dostkam says. 'But it’s a long process. We’re restoring buildings but healing hearts will take much longer.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/b1rtzjwf1e	2025-02-10T21:32:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/09/HJu6H11ItJl/HJu6H11ItJl_0_52_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Cartoons drawn by IDF officer turn into Gaza war diary	After his brigade commander recognized his talents, Col. A.'s daily cartoons in Gaza turned into depictions of bravery, resolve and memories of the fallen Col. A. vividly recalls the first cartoon he drew at the start of the IDF’s ground operation in Gaza — his brigade commander as a lion, standing on the ruins of a destroyed building in the north of the Strip. 'I left the brigade commander a keepsake so he'd know I was there,' he says. Pleased, the commander asked him to draw a daily cartoon, which became a tradition. Some of his cartoons depicted combat, while others provided updates on events in Israel and abroad. 'We were completely cut off from phones and radio,' he explains. 'People looked forward to it every day, asked when I'd draw and even suggested ideas.' After three rounds of fighting in the south and north, A. completed his service with the brigade and took command of the 185th 'Galil-Golan' Brigade. 'Our motto, 'Anytime, anywhere, for any mission,' isn't just words,' he says. 'Reservists call each other 'brother' because they don’t always remember names — but they'd die for one another. We're all in this together.' A., a lawyer with a background in high-tech, lives in Mitzpe Ilan with his wife and five children. He describes his drawing skills as 'just a hobby.' His collection of cartoons became a wartime journal offering a unique perspective. His most memorable drawings include: a commander always seen with a book, even before battle; a battalion commander lifting a stuck vehicle with one hand; humanitarian aid drifting in the wind toward the brigade’s combat zone; soldiers making do with canned food in what they dubbed 'Jabaliya Restaurant' and fitness training where troops replaced weights with water bottles. The brigade lost 21 soldiers during the war in Gaza. A. honored them through his cartoons. One, dedicated to Capt. (res.) Yuval Halivni, Master Sgt. (res.) Avihay Amsalem and Maj. (res.) Eitan Menachem Neeman — killed in the October 9 battle for Sderot — depicts the three arches at the Shaar HaNegev junction, now wrapped in yellow ribbons for the hostage-release campaign. 'They connected in my mind with commemorating the three fallen soldiers,' he says. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another cartoon commemorates Sgt. Maj. (res.) David Schwartz from Alon Shvut and Sgt. 1st Class (res.) Yakir Hexter from Jerusalem, who studied together at the Har Etzion Yeshiva. 'At the funeral in Gush Etzion, I was shown a photo of them studying together,' A. recalls. 'I depicted them in uniform with their gear, symbolizing both their bond as students and their fate as soldiers.' One illustration shows Master Sgt. (res.) Gal Meir Eisenkot and Master Sgt. (res.) Eyal Meir Berkowitz holding the biblical Tablets of the Law. 'It represents the victory achieved in battle thanks to them,' says A. Another, depicting angel wings, portrays a mass-casualty incident where he oversaw the evacuation of 13 wounded soldiers in a dense urban area. 'The relief I felt when the rescue jeep arrived is indescribable,' he says. One of his most significant drawings is inspired by The Last Supper, painted on the ruins of a destroyed building where troops had gathered before leaving Gaza. 'On the table, instead of food, there are explosives, mines and bombs,' he says. 'It captures the final moments of the combat engineers’ mission, with a nod to Leonardo da Vinci’s painting.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hkcarapyyg	2025-02-10T20:16:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/09/Hklnwtu8KJx/Hklnwtu8KJx_0_54_1179_664_0_small.jpg

Seeking legitimacy: Abbas moves to end stipends for terrorists, f...	In a controversial move, Palestinian Authority President cancels laws providing financial support to families of terrorists and prisoners; Hamas and Islamic Jihad call move a 'blatant surrender to US and Zionist pressure' Has the final curtain fallen on payments to terrorists and their families? Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas issued a presidential decree on Monday canceling laws that allowed financial payments to families of prisoners in Israeli jails or to families of terrorists killed during attacks. This decision quickly drew condemnation from terrorist groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad. According to the previous Palestinian policy, anyone imprisoned or harmed due to their involvement in terrorism was entitled to a salary and a stipend for their family. Additionally, families of terrorists killed in attacks received monthly support. Under this system, the severity of the punishment imposed on the terrorist determined the amount of the salary—the harsher the punishment, the higher the payment. Abbas’ presidential decree cancels provisions within the laws and regulations that governed these financial payments to the families of prisoners, deceased, and injured terrorists. According to the decree, 'all families receiving payments under the previous legislation will now fall under the same guidelines as families benefiting from social welfare programs. The authorities for the social welfare programs in the Palestinian Authority have been transferred to the Palestinian Economic Empowerment Fund, which will take responsibility for providing social care to all Palestinian families without discrimination.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Palestinian Economic Empowerment Fund is an independent legal entity managed by a board of trustees appointed by Abbas. It operates in accordance with the law, with clearly defined tasks and transparent mechanisms, and is subject to administrative and financial oversight, including monitoring by international institutions to ensure transparency, proper procedures, and fair distribution of resources. Under the new decree, the fund will strive to collect all necessary funds, grants, and allocations for its various distribution categories, particularly in light of the significant increase in families requiring social care, support, and empowerment following the recent war in Gaza and the West Bank. The goal, as stated, is to strengthen the resilience of the Palestinian people and support the adoption of diverse social systems. Officials in Ramallah noted that this move was made as part of efforts to bolster the Palestinian Authority’s standing and legal position at the United Nations and other international bodies, with the aim of achieving international recognition and full membership for the State of Palestine. This initiative is also part of broader efforts to protect key national interests. According to the Palestinian Authority, 'We must implement development and economic recovery plans, support reconstruction efforts, and work toward lifting the financial blockade and halting the illegal deductions imposed by Israeli occupation authorities on Palestinian taxpayers’ money, which amount to billions.' Predictably, terror organizations are less than thrilled Hamas condemned the move. 'We denounce Abbas’ decision to cancel the financial stipends for the families of prisoners, martyrs, and the wounded, abandoning their national cause at a time when the people and resistance forces are working to protect the rights of released prisoners and to support their livelihoods,' the terrorist organization said. 'This behavior is unpatriotic and represents a betrayal of one of the core national principles. We call for an immediate reversal of this decision and for resistance to Israeli and U.S. pressure.' Islamic Jihad also criticized the Palestinian Authority’s decision. 'We condemn the decision by the Ramallah Authority to cancel financial stipends for the families of prisoners, martyrs, and the wounded. This decision is a clear abandonment of the prisoner issue and a blatant surrender to U.S. and Zionist pressure. Halting stipends for prisoners, especially at a time when resistance forces have achieved victories over the enemy through prisoner exchanges, is an attempt to weaken our people’s morale and a betrayal of those who have sacrificed years of their lives behind bars.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj25dgofje	2025-02-10T20:00:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/24/B19009FBz6/B19009FBz6_0_83_1300_732_0_small.jpg

State Department says in a statement that it reiterates the 'importance of close cooperation to advance post-conflict planning for the governance and security of Gaza and stressed Hamas can never govern Gaza or threaten Israel again' Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday that Arab states rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's widely condemned plan to displace Palestinians in Gaza and take control of the enclave. Egypt's foreign ministry said Abdelatty, in a meeting in Washington, stressed the importance of expediting Gaza's reconstruction while Palestinians remained there. A statement by the U.S. State Department after the meeting did not explicitly mention Trump's plan but added that Rubio 'reiterated the importance of close cooperation to advance post-conflict planning for the governance and security of Gaza and stressed Hamas can never govern Gaza or threaten Israel again.' Abdelatty said he was looking forward to working with the new U.S. administration to achieve 'comprehensive and just peace and stability' in the region, according to the Egyptian foreign ministry statement. He also met with U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff in a separate meeting, where he echoed similar statements, the foreign ministry said.

Israel denies ICJ commitment to investigate October 7 attack desp...	Senior officials deny Gali Baharav-Miara’s claim Israel told World Court it would establish state inquiry with Netanyahu’s approval; 'The prime minister never approved such a thing,' they say Israeli officials on Monday denied Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara’s claim that Israel had informed the International Court of Justice (ICJ) of plans to establish a state commission of inquiry into the failures surrounding the October 7 Hamas attack. Senior officials said Baharav-Miara’s statement, made during a heated government meeting a day earlier, was incorrect. 'Israel never committed to establishing a commission of inquiry in The Hague, and the prime minister never approved such a thing,' the officials said. The meeting, during which several ministers criticized Baharav-Miara, was held in response to a High Court of Justice-mandated discussion on forming a state commission to investigate the attack. When the attorney general questioned why Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar’s opinion had not been shared with ministers, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacted angrily. 'He’s a clerk; how is he relevant to this matter?' Netanyahu reportedly said, later questioning Bar’s authority to express an opinion on the issue. Baharav-Miara defended her stance, saying Israel had conveyed to the ICJ that it intended to establish a state commission of inquiry. Netanyahu responded, 'Who authorized this?' to which she replied, 'You did, sir.' However, officials pushed back on her assertion, saying Israel had merely stated that its legal system allows for investigative bodies capable of probing decision-makers but had never committed to forming one. 'The prime minister never approved such a thing,' the officials said, adding that the ICJ prosecutor is demanding an investigation into Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant's conduct over the course of the war, whereas the proposed commission would focus solely on the failures leading to October 7. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'This was not promised to the prosecutor, it is unrelated, and even if it had been, it would not be relevant, as the prosecutor is seeking a criminal investigation,' they said. Baharav-Miara’s office declined to comment on the officials’ claims. Knesset debate over inquiry commission intensifies The issue of establishing a state commission of inquiry was also at the center of faction meetings in the Knesset. National Unity Party leader Benny Gantz criticized the government’s hesitation, calling it 'complete detachment' from reality. 'The idea of not establishing a state commission of inquiry into the greatest disaster to befall the Jewish people since the Holocaust is unacceptable,' he said. Gantz dismissed claims that the High Court bore responsibility for the attack, calling such arguments 'pathetic spin.' He emphasized that a state commission would have full authority to subpoena key figures but warned that political and security officials must take responsibility. 'The October 7 disaster is a defining event in Israel’s history. It must be thoroughly investigated, and the only way to do so is through a state commission of inquiry,' he said. Opposition leader Yair Lapid announced a nationwide signature campaign demanding the establishment of an inquiry. 'The government is doing everything to bury the state commission of inquiry,' he said. 'They postponed it by another three months because they don’t want us to know the truth—why the prime minister ignored intelligence, why they strengthened Hamas and why the hostages are still not home.' Lapid accused the government of trying to avoid accountability. 'This was the greatest disaster in our nation’s history, and they are doing everything to avoid responsibility,' he said. Yisrael Beitenu leader Avigdor Liberman echoed the criticism, arguing that the failure to establish a commission showed the government prioritized political survival over security concerns. 'A leader who refuses to investigate is a leader unwilling to take responsibility,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1x3eyufkx	2025-02-10T12:54:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/02/02/H1HoGst3o/H1HoGst3o_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

As Iran rapidly approaches nuclear armament, the US president is aiming to corner the Islamic Republic into accepting a new deal, one that he hopes would have better terms for the US and Israel than the 2015 JCPOA agreement U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent statements on the possibility of reviving a nuclear agreement with Iran have reignited debates over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions and regional security in the Middle East. Iran is inching closer to nuclear capability, with enrichment infrastructure decentralized across fortified underground sites, and the stakes for international security have never been higher. President Trump aims to position himself as a master dealmaker, capable of extracting significant concessions from Iran, but experts remain skeptical as to whether his strategy can yield tangible results. President Trump’s approach to Iran has oscillated between economic pressure and the promise of negotiation. Meir Litvak, director of the Alliance Center for Iranian Studies at Tel Aviv University, told The Media Line that the president sees himself as 'the ultimate dealmaker' and remains convinced that he can secure a better agreement than the one negotiated under President Barack Obama. In 2015, President Obama signed a deal with Iran known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Under that plan, Iran agreed to put limits on its nuclear program and to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to monitor its nuclear facilities. In return, it received relief from international sanctions. In 2018, President Trump withdrew from the agreement, which he called 'a horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.' Litvak explained that the president aimed to apply pressure on Iran to force the country to agree to a better deal. That attempt failed, he said, 'and now we’re facing a situation where Iran is much closer to nuclear capability.' International watchdogs estimate that Iran has enriched uranium to levels rapidly approaching weapons-grade, with the country poised to start producing nuclear weapons within weeks. 'By lifting Iran’s sanctions, Washington may push Tehran further away from China in the process.' Nima Baheli, an Iranian political analyst, said that President Trump’s strategy may be focused on reducing China’s influence in the Middle East. 'By lifting Iran’s sanctions, Washington may push Tehran further away from China in the process,' Baheli told The Media Line. That strategy would fit into President Trump’s tendency to prioritize economic pragmatism over long-term political stability. But since China is Iran’s major oil consumer, a diplomatic break between the two countries is unlikely, Litvak said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On Friday, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the idea of reentering into negotiations with the U.S. 'Negotiating with such a government should not be done; it is neither wise, intelligent, nor honorable,' Khamenei said. Litvak described Khamenei’s recent statement as 'a major disappointment.' 'Until a week ago, there were signs that Khamenei was willing to make negotiations with the U.S.,' he said. 'The JCPOA was a bad deal, but it was better than the alternative. We are in a worse situation today than we were in 2015.' The supreme leader’s refusal to negotiate is a sign of his deep-seated distrust of American diplomacy, fueled by President Trump’s abrupt withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018. According to Baheli, his refusal is not representative of the will of the entire Iranian regime. 'We also see how more and more representatives, both politicians and military figures, seem to be asking the supreme leadership to review the Iranian nuclear doctrine,' he said. Alongside talk of the U.S. reentering into negotiations with Iran, President Trump has also suggested that Israel or the U.S. might strike Iran’s nuclear facilities. But Baheli noted that the strategic positioning of Iran’s nuclear sites would make doing so difficult. 'There are many structures scattered on the territory, and above all, they are screened from the mountains, from the rocks,' he said. Iran adopted its policy of nuclear site decentralization following Israel’s 1981 strike on Iraq’s Osirak reactor. Many Israelis prefer a military response to Iran over a diplomatic solution, but Litvak is an advocate for renewed negotiations. 'I am one of those Israelis who believe that a deal is better for Israel,' he said. 'The JCPOA was a bad deal, but it was better than the alternative. We are in a worse situation today than we were in 2015.' On Friday, President Trump told the New York Post that he would rather make a deal with Iran than end up 'bombing the hell out of it.' 'If we made the deal, Israel wouldn’t bomb them,' he said. For Litvak, the ambiguity of that statement is concerning. 'There is a problem in the statement in which he said that if he will reach a deal, Israel will not have to bomb Iran. That can mean either a veiled threat against Iran or that he is willing to give Israel a green light in case there is no deal,' he said. As President Trump continues to push for a new Iran deal, the reality remains that the Islamic Republic is unlikely to embrace major concessions without ironclad guarantees. 'As long as Khamenei is alive, he would not allow any serious rapprochement with the U.S.,' Litvak said. Facing an obstinate Khamenei and an Islamic Republic rapidly approaching nuclear armament, the president’s skills as dealmaker-in-chief are being put to the test, with international security hanging in the balance.

Hamas: Hostage release delay is a warning to Israel	Egypt says hostage deal talks on hold, awaiting US signal on next steps; Israel sees group's move as psychological pressure to gain leverage in negotiations, not collapse of deal; Hamas says warning allows mediators time to act Hamas said Monday that its decision to halt the release of hostages 'until further notice' is meant as a warning to Israel and an attempt to pressure it into fully adhering to the terms of the cease-fire agreement. 'The delay in releasing prisoners is a message of warning to Israel and a means to pressure it to strictly comply with the agreement,' Hamas military spokesman Abu Obeida said in a statement. Hamas added that it intentionally announced the delay five days in advance to give mediators sufficient time to push Israel to meet its commitments while keeping the door open for the exchange to proceed on schedule. An Israeli official called Hamas’ announcement 'concerning' but noted there was still time to resolve the crisis before Saturday. Israeli negotiators believe Hamas’ move is a pressure tactic rather than a collapse of the deal. 'Mediators, including the U.S., have a vested interest in ensuring the upcoming releases proceed,' the official said. Jerusalem sees Hamas’ actions as part of an effort to maximize its leverage in negotiations and apply psychological pressure, rather than an outright rejection of the deal. Israeli officials believe Hamas’ delay is primarily aimed at securing increased humanitarian aid deliveries into Gaza and bolstering its position ahead of further talks. The decision also reflects internal power struggles between Hamas leaders in Gaza and those abroad, Israeli sources said. Meanwhile, two Egyptian security sources told Reuters that mediators fear a breakdown of the cease-fire agreement after Hamas' announcement. Hamas negotiators said U.S. guarantees for the cease-fire were no longer in place given a plan by President Donald Trump to displace Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, and mediators postponed talks until a clear indication of Washington's intent to continue the phased deal was received. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamas claims Israel has failed to meet key commitments under the agreement, including allowing displaced Gazans to return to northern Gaza, halting military strikes and facilitating humanitarian aid deliveries. Hamas spokesman Abd al-Latif al-Qanou accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being responsible for the delay. 'We call on mediators to pressure Israel to fully implement the cease-fire agreement,' he told Qatar’s Al-Araby TV. Hamas officials also cited recent statements from Netanyahu and other Israeli ministers regarding a potential return to fighting, as well as Israel’s conditions for the second phase of negotiations, which reportedly include the expulsion of Hamas leaders and the dismantling of its military wing. Israeli officials say U.S. and regional mediators are now working to bring Hamas back in line with the agreement. They believe Hamas is not seeking to collapse the deal but rather to extract additional concessions, particularly on aid shipments. The hostage deal, now in its first phase, was set to include the release of 33 hostages. So far, 16 have been freed, with 17 more expected in the coming days. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjzrw0vyje	2025-02-10T10:59:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/04/r1gyNt1K1x/r1gyNt1K1x_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu, Trump effigies paraded in cages in Tehran	Marking 46th anniversary of Islamic Revolution, Iranian regime supporters parade effigies of US, Israeli leaders in cages through capital; amid 'Death to Israel' and 'Death to America' chants, officials denounce Western sanctions and vow resistance Tens of thousands of Iranians took to the streets Monday to mark the 46th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, with celebrations featuring anti-American and anti-Israeli rhetoric, military displays and effigies of U.S. and Israeli leaders in cages. The annual event, commemorating the 1979 overthrow of Iran’s pro-Western monarchy, took place amid heightened tensions over threats from Israel and the U.S. regarding Iran’s nuclear program. In Tehran, a central display featured a person dressed as U.S. President Donald Trump 'under arrest,' alongside effigies of Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu depicted as prisoners in a cage. Thousands of demonstrators, waving Iranian flags and banners, marched through the capital’s streets chanting 'Death to America' and 'Death to Israel' despite freezing temperatures. Military displays in Tehran’s Azadi Square included mock-ups of Iranian missiles, while participants posed for photos in front of anti-Western exhibits. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I know there are many economic problems in the country, but I’m here to say we will support our country no matter how much Trump and the Israelis threaten us,' said Mohsen Amini, a 48-year-old teacher attending the event. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, marking his first revolution anniversary since taking office last year, delivered a speech blaming Israel for regional instability and accusing the U.S. of hypocrisy in its dealings with Tehran. 'If Washington is sincere about wanting to negotiate with us, why did it impose new sanctions?' he asked, vowing that Iran would not succumb to foreign pressure. He also accused Trump of trying to bring Iran 'to its knees.' The celebrations come as Iran faces economic turmoil from years of sanctions imposed over its nuclear program, its support for terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah and human rights abuses. Last week, Trump announced he would reinstate the 'maximum pressure' policy against Iran, imposing additional sanctions unless Tehran agrees to new terms on its nuclear program. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei rejected the idea of talks, calling negotiations with the U.S. 'neither wise nor dignified.' State television broadcast celebrations across Iran, urging citizens to participate. The revolution’s anniversary is a public holiday, with schools and government offices closed. A delegation from Hamas, led by senior official Khalil al-Hayya, also attended the events in Tehran. Al-Hayya condemned Western proposals for Gaza’s future, declaring, 'We will bring them down as we brought down the projects before them.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1zercpy1l	2025-02-10T08:53:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/BJcRB4DFye/BJcRB4DFye_18_36_1073_604_0_small.jpg

Accused killer of American journalist Marie Colvin is free in Syr...	Activists and human rights groups are demanding the prosecution of Khaled al-Fares, who is accused of aiding Syrian forces in tracking down and killing American journalist Marie Colvin in 2012 Protests have erupted in Damascus and other parts of Syria over the return of Khaled al-Fares, a man accused of war crimes under the rule of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Activists and human rights groups are calling for his prosecution, citing his alleged involvement in tracking American journalist Marie Colvin, leading to her assassination in 2012. Al-Fares, who fled Syria after the fall of the Assad regime, arrived in Damascus from Dubai last week. His reappearance, along with the reopening of his car dealership on the Hama-Homs road, has fueled widespread anger. According to sources speaking to The Media Line, he now moves freely between Homs and Damascus, despite the accusations against him. Documents obtained by The Media Line suggest that al-Fares was a leading operative in a spy network for the former regime and a member of the pro-Assad National Defense Forces in Homs. Testimonies from defected regime members reportedly link him to Colvin’s death. Colvin, a renowned foreign correspondent for The Sunday Times, was covering the Syrian conflict from Baba Amr in Homs when she was killed in an artillery strike on February 22, 2012. French photojournalist Rémi Ochlik was also killed in the attack. U.S. court documents from a 2019 lawsuit against the Assad government confirm that Syrian forces deliberately targeted Colvin’s position after receiving intelligence from regime informants, one of whom was allegedly al-Fares. Al-Fares is also accused of drug trafficking and leading the so-called 'death squad,' which carried out massacres against civilians, including the April 18, 2011, Homs Clock Tower massacre and a brutal attack on Baba Amr in 2012. 'A notorious criminal is being reintroduced in Syria. … It seems many criminals are working to settle their status with the new regime, under public applause and media silence.' The Syrian Committee for Human Rights has urged the new government to prosecute al-Fares rather than allow him to live freely. Syrian activist Najm al-Din al-Najm criticized the lack of accountability, telling The Media Line, 'A notorious criminal is being reintroduced in Syria. … It seems many criminals are working to settle their status with the new regime, under public applause and media silence.' He added, 'Al-Fares returned to Damascus after fleeing to the UAE for a month. Now he moves freely between Homs and Damascus and has opened a car showroom. He was a thug tasked with monitoring journalists in Homs and provided Marie Colvin’s coordinates to the regime, leading to her precise targeting and killing by artillery shelling. He was personally rewarded by Maher al-Assad for this.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: After al-Fares allegedly provided intelligence leading to Colvin’s death, Maher al-Assad, commander of the Fourth Division and brother of the Syrian president, reportedly gifted him a Hyundai Genesis as a reward. Tamer Turkmani, a human rights activist, confirmed to The Media Line that al-Fares’ involvement in war crimes is well-documented. Similarly, Syrian politician Maher Sharaf al-Din accused al-Fares of drug trafficking for the Assad regime and playing a direct role in Colvin’s assassination. Al-Fares’ return has raised broader concerns about the lack of accountability for war crimes in Syria. Since protests demanding his prosecution began, the Syrian government has remained silent. Many Syrians continue to call for transitional justice, hoping that those responsible for atrocities will eventually face trial. Marie Colvin was one of the most respected war correspondents of her time, known for reporting from the front lines of conflicts in Kosovo, Chechnya, and Sri Lanka. In her final dispatch, she provided firsthand accounts of the suffering of civilians in Homs under relentless bombardment by Assad’s forces. In 2013, Stony Brook University in New York established the Marie Colvin Center for International Reporting in her memory. Her family also founded the Marie Colvin Memorial Fund, which is supported by the Long Island Community Foundation and raises donations in her name to honor her humanitarian legacy. Colvin’s family filed a civil lawsuit against the Syrian government in 2016, arguing that senior officials had orchestrated her assassination. In 2019, a U.S. court found the Assad regime responsible and awarded $302 million in damages to her family. The ruling confirmed that Colvin’s death was not accidental but a targeted killing meant to silence her reporting on the Syrian conflict. Despite these international legal actions, al-Fares has not been held accountable for his alleged role in her killing. His ability to return to Syria and resume business activities has only intensified calls for justice. The broader implications of al-Fares’ return Al-Fares’ case is a stark reminder of the broader issue of impunity in Syria. The Syrian civil war, which began in 2011, has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands and the displacement of millions. While some former regime figures have been prosecuted in European courts under universal jurisdiction, many alleged war criminals continue to live freely within Syria. The ongoing protests against al-Fares’ return reflect a deep frustration among Syrians seeking justice for war crimes committed during the conflict. Activists argue that without legal consequences for figures like al-Fares, true reconciliation and stability in Syria will remain elusive. For now, al-Fares’ presence in Syria continues to stoke outrage, with calls growing louder for his prosecution. Whether the Syrian government will respond remains uncertain, but the demand for accountability is unlikely to fade.

'The killing of [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah shattered the axis of evil and led to [Syrian President Bashar] Assad’s downfall. These great achievements were once unimaginable dreams.' Netanyahu accused the opposition of pushing for an early end to the war. 'Most of you supported stopping the war very early—before entering Rafah, before securing the Philadelphi Corridor,' he said. 'Imagine what would have happened if I had given in to you?'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkebaqwf1l	2025-02-10T06:43:11-08:00

Yarden Bibas discharged from hospital, says won't heal as long as...	Former hostage completes medical evaluations as wife Shiri and sons Ariel and Kfir remain in captivity; family says Yarden committed to fighting for return of his loved ones and feels a deep duty to ensure no one is left behind Yarden Bibas was discharged Monday from Sheba Medical Center after completing all necessary medical evaluations, roughly a week and a half after being freed from Hamas captivity. His family emphasized that while his release is a step forward, the journey to recovery remains incomplete. 'The road to healing is still long, and it won’t truly be whole until Shiri, Ariel, Kfir and all the hostages are back home,' the family said in a statement, referring to Yarden's wife and two young sons who were abducted separately on October 7 and remain in Gaza. 'Yarden is determined to fight for their return and feels obligated to do everything in his power to ensure no one is left behind.' The Bibas family expressed deep gratitude to Israel’s security forces and the medical team at Sheba for their 'professionalism, dedication and sensitivity' throughout Yarden’s care. They also thanked the Israeli public for 'the overwhelming support and warm embrace during these difficult days' and requested that both the public and the media respect their privacy to allow Yarden time and space to heal. 'Help me bring back the light' On Friday, Bibas issued his first public statement since being freed, expressing anguish over the fate of Shiri and the boys. 'Sadly, my family hasn’t come back to me yet. They are still there. My light is still there, and as long as they are there, everything here is dark,' he said. 'You helped bring me home—now help me bring back the light to my life.' In a message released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum on his behalf, Bibas described his ordeal and the dramatic contrast upon returning to Israel. 'On October 7, 2023, I was kidnapped from the State of Israel. On February 1, 2025, I returned to a different country,' he said. 'I always knew that in times of disaster, the people of Israel unite. But I never realized just how much.' 'I want to thank the entire nation, everyone who stood by me and my family,' he continued. 'I appreciate the strength you gave to my loved ones. I’ve heard about everything you did for me and my family, and the word ‘thank you’ isn’t big enough to express my gratitude.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Addressing IDF soldiers directly, Bibas called them 'heroes,' saying simply, 'Thank you.' He urged Israelis to continue fighting for the return of all hostages, including one of his closest friends. 'They have families, partners, children and friends waiting for them at home. Let’s do everything possible to bring them back. Please, don’t stop. Keep fighting until everyone is home,' he pleaded. Bibas also issued a personal appeal to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'Now I’m speaking in my own words—no one dictated this for me: Bring my family back. Bring my friends back. Bring everyone home.' Last Saturday, Bibas was freed after 484 days in Hamas captivity, alongside fellow hostages Ofer Calderon and Keith Siegel. During his helicopter flight to Sheba Medical Center, he posed for a photo with his father, Eli, and his sister, Ofri, holding a handwritten sign: 'I want to thank all of Israel for your support and help. My family told me how hard you fought for me. I deeply appreciate it—it is not taken for granted.' Bibas also took a moment to wish his grandfather, Yechiel, a happy 90th birthday. 'Happy birthday, Grandpa,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byzbstpy1g	2025-02-10T06:00:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/HkiwW9iuJg/HkiwW9iuJg_710_42_966_544_0_small.jpg
Trump says no right of return for Palestinians under Gaza plan	U.S. President Donald Trump said Palestinians would have no right of return to Gaza under his plan for the United States to take over the territory, in an interview excerpt released Monday.

Gantz: Israel cannot allow Hamas to rebuild on its border	National Unity party leader Benny Gantz said Monday that Israel cannot allow Hamas to regain strength along its border after the release of hostages, warning against complacency. 'Anyone who thinks that after the hostages are freed, we will sit quietly and allow Hamas murderers to rule and rearm on our border is living on October 6,' Gantz said at the start of a faction meeting, referring to the day before Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel. Gantz also addressed comments made by former defense minister Yoav Gallant in an interview with Ynet’s sister publication Yedioth Ahronoth, in which Gallant described Israel’s decision not to strike Hezbollah on October 11 as 'the greatest security failure in the country’s history.' Gantz defended the government’s actions at the time, noting that his party joined the emergency government on October 12. 'We believed the focus had to be on the south, not the north,' he said. 'Israel doesn’t know what it wants for itself, but I believe we saved the country.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk6rptpk1e	2025-02-10T05:29:46-08:00	
Lebanese army seizes weapons cache in raids on homes in country's...	The Lebanese army said Monday its forces raided the homes of wanted individuals in two northern towns, seizing a large cache of weapons, including rockets, hand grenades, firearms and ammunition. In a statement, the military said units, backed by patrols from the Directorate of Intelligence, carried out the operations in the towns of Al-Qasr, in the Hermel region, and Al-Asfourieh, in Akkar. The statement did not specify if any arrests were made or provide details on the identities of the suspects. Lebanon’s army has been conducting security operations across the country as it seeks to curb the proliferation of illegal weapons, particularly in areas where armed groups and smuggling networks are active. The raid was unrelated to Lebanon’s cease-fire agreement with Israel, which mandates that the army prevent non-state groups, namely Hezbollah, from maintaining weapons in the country’s south along the Israeli border.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sycreuvykx	2025-02-10T03:46:21-08:00	
Syria’s Sharaa says thousands volunteering for new army	Syria’s transitional president Ahmad al-Sharaa said thousands of volunteers are joining the newly formed Syrian army following the fall of the former regime. In a podcast released Monday with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair’s spokesman Alastair Campbell and former Conservative minister Rory Stewart, Sharaa emphasized that military service in the new force is voluntary, not mandatory. He noted that many young men had fled Syria to avoid the compulsory conscription imposed by the previous government, which had become a significant concern for Syrians after the country’s war erupted in 2011. During the interview, Sharaa renewed his call for the lifting of Western sanctions on Syria, arguing that there is growing consensus among visitors to Damascus that the restrictions should be removed. He said Syria faces significant security challenges and stressed that economic development is essential for achieving stability. Without growth, he warned, the country could face further chaos and insecurity.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryqgw00ptyl	2025-02-10T03:30:51-08:00	
Israeli delegation returns from Doha; Palestinian official says I...	The delegation dealt only with Phase I of the cease-fire and hostage return deal; Netanyahu will convene the cabinet Tuesday, which will be asked to approve the Israeli conditions to move forward to the second phase; Hamas is expected to refuse and a senior Palestinian official told the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen channel: 'Israeli statements indicate that it does not want a permanent cease-fire' A senior Palestinian official in one of the Gaza terrorist organizations told the Al-Mayadeen channel, affiliated with the Shiite axis and Hezbollah, on Monday afternoon that 'Hamas believes that Israel is planning to scuttle the cease-fire agreement.' According to the official, Hamas believes that Israel is relying on the United States and U.S. President Donald Trump and, according to him, the statements coming from Israel regarding the second phase of the agreement indicate its intention not to reach a permanent cease-fire and complete the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, the Israeli negotiating delegation that went to Qatar for discussions on the first phase of the agreement has returned to Israel. On Tuesday, the political-security cabinet will convene to discuss the second phase, and in the discussion Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to approve the Israeli conditions for progressing to Phase II: the expulsion of the Hamas leadership from Gaza; the disarmament of the terrorist organization's military wing; and the release of all the hostages. All of these, if accepted, are supposed to bring an end to the war on Israel's part but, according to estimates, Hamas is expected to refuse this. The Israeli delegation that traveled to Doha dealt with phase one issues only, and continued its talks and the implementation of the first phase's steps, with the aim of ensuring that there would be no further violations. Netanyahu reached agreements on the principles of the second phase with U.S. President Donald Trump and his envoy Steve Witkoff - however, Hamas is not expected to accept them - and therefore an effort will be made by the Israeli side to extend the first phase as much as possible to allow for the release of additional hostages and an extension of the cease-fire. The Arabic-language Sky News network quoted Musa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official, as saying at noon that 'the negotiations on the second phase of the agreement have not begun, Netanyahu missed the deadline due to his visit to the United States. We expect the negotiations to continue and take their natural course.' Phase II of the deal, which includes ending the war, effectively marks the beginning of 'the day after' in the Gaza Strip - and therefore the list of demands that Hamas has presented in the past regarding it has repeatedly crossed all of Israel's red lines. The terrorist organization's main demand, in order to agree to the release of the 65 Israeli and foreign hostages who are not included in the first phase and are considered a final bargaining chip for it, is to end the war. This is a complete end, a 'sustainable peace' without reservations, within the framework of which Israel will fully withdraw from the Gaza Strip and allow billions of dollars from other countries to be poured in for its reconstruction. If Hamas does not agree to an extension of Phase I and if it ends with the return of the 33 hostages, Israel may face the question of whether to return to fighting while 65 hostages, some still alive, remain in Hamas captivity, in harsh conditions and while being tortured, according to testimonies published last night from the hostages who returned on Saturday. An Israeli move to Phase II while accepting Hamas' demands may put Netanyahu in a political limbo, as Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and his Religious Zionist party have already announced that at the end of the first phase they will demand a return to fighting and the destruction of Hamas. On Sunday night, Smotrich said that the terrorist organization's demands, including its remaining in power, will set a dangerous precedent for the future. 'What will be the next stage? The terrorist organizations are kidnapping more Israelis and demanding an Israeli withdrawal from Judea and Samaria, evacuation of settlements, and the establishment of a Palestinian state in exchange for their release? This is a red line that must not be crossed,' Smotrich said. 'There will be those who will say that we have already crossed this line at the current stage of the deal by agreeing to withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor and allow the return of Gazans to the northern Gaza Strip. This is true, and this is one of the reasons we opposed the deal. But this is a temporary and reversible step, it must not be turned into a slippery and dangerous slope.' Smotrich concluded his remarks by saying, 'This bright red line must not be crossed. We will not be forced to take political steps as part of a deal to release hostages. There is no responsible leader who would make policy decisions and submit to political dictates as part of a hostage deal. Anyone who would do this does not deserve to be a leader. Our government will not succumb to this madness.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rju0dvdkjg	2025-02-10T03:30:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/By110WPXHKyx/By110WPXHKyx_0_182_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Elbit to provide digital fire command system to European country ...	The system enables real-time, coordinated command of all firepower units — artillery, rockets, and more — rather than operating them individually; It was first tested by the IDF across all fronts during the Gaza war Elbit Systems has secured contracts worth approximately $100 million over the next two years to supply a national digital fire command center to an undisclosed European country. The system will integrate and connect the country's strategic and tactical firepower platforms. The new command center will enhance the country's ability to efficiently manage its firepower, including artillery, rockets, mortars, precision-guided and loitering munitions, as well as drones, UAVs and various sensors such as radars and observation systems. By fully digitizing the fire control and targeting processes, the system will integrate real-time intelligence, significantly improving response times from target identification to engagement. Notably, Israel’s recent war marked the first time the IDF deployed a fully digital command-and-control system, enabling seamless synchronization across all firepower units. According to Elbit, the system includes advanced, integrated capabilities such as Torch-X Fires digital command-and-control technology, E-LynX software-defined radios, and GRX-8000 secure microwave communication systems for high-speed data transmission. Currently, many artillery systems operate as independent units with voice-based communication rather than digital integration. This new system will digitize the entire firepower network, from target detection to engagement. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Elbit is also supplying a cutting-edge communications infrastructure based on its E-LynX software-defined radio technology, allowing secure transmission of voice, data and video simultaneously. Haim Delmar, executive vice president and general manager of Elbit Systems C4I & Cyber, emphasized the evolving nature of modern warfare and the growing demand for Elbit's networked, multi-domain combat solutions.

'The customer's decision to once again choose Elbit Systems reaffirms the technological and operational advantages of our solutions.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skdlovvk1x	2025-02-10T03:29:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/13/SkWISTaLZT/SkWISTaLZT_0_114_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Trump’s plans for Gaza ‘doomed,’ senior Hamas official says	Hamas' Gaza chief Khalil al-Hayya vows to resist US president's post-war plans for enclave; 'We will bring them down as we brought down the projects before them,' he says Hamas' Gaza chief Khalil al-Hayya said on Monday that the plans of the West, the United States and U.S. President Donald Trump for the Gaza Strip were 'doomed' and vowed to resist them. 'We will bring them down as we brought down the projects before them,' he said during a commemoration of the 46th anniversary of Iran's Islamic Revolution. Trump said on Sunday he was committed to buying and owning Gaza, but could allow sections of the war-ravaged land to be rebuilt by other states in the Middle East. Last week, in a joint press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump proposed turning the war-torn territory into what he called the 'Riviera of the Middle East.' He also floated the idea of relocating Gaza’s Palestinian population to other countries, particularly Egypt and Jordan, as it is being rebuilt. The proposal has been met with widespread criticism, especially in the Arab world, where officials have condemned any forced displacement of Palestinians. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkcmjdwkjx	2025-02-10T03:21:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/rJnzHo8uJx/rJnzHo8uJx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Eliya Cohen and Alon Ohel were kidnapped to Gaza from protected space along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin and Or Levi, who was released; Their families describe inhumane conditions, and the horrors they experience in the tunnels: 'They are treated like animals'; Eliya's girlfriend: 'He doesn't know I'm alive' Four people were kidnapped from the 'shelter of death' on October 7: Hirsch Goldberg-Polin, Or Levy, Alon Ohel and Eliya Cohen. Hersh was murdered in a Hamas tunnel under Gaza, Or was released on Saturday after 491 days in captivity - but Alon and Eliya remain in hell in Gaza, in inhumane conditions. Elia's partner, Ziv Abud, revealed Monday that testimonies from someone who was with him in captivity indicated that he does not know she is alive. Ziv miraculously survived the horrors in the shelter, but Eliya was abducted into Gaza by the terrorists. Meanwhile, Eliya's mother, Sigi, expressed shock in an interview on Monday morning at the harsh conditions in which her son and Alon Ohel are being held. After the release of the hostages in the last round on Saturday, the family received its first sign of life from him - and his family revealed the terrible conditions in which the two young men are being held, including being restrained in chains. 'We know that they have been chained from the day they were kidnapped until today, which is unimaginable. A person has been chained for a year and four months, and guards are standing over them with drawn weapons, and they haven't moved for a second,' Eliya's mother told Ynet. 'They are treated like animals. They hardly receive food, they don't see daylight, they were in the tunnels from the day they were kidnapped until today. And I'm not talking about the abuse, I don't know what they went through there.' In a social media post Sunday night, Eliya's partner, Ziv, wrote: 'Now I know that you don't know that I'm alive. From the testimonies of people who were with you in captivity, I know that you don't know what we went through here and what we are doing, not even a little bit, because you are completely cut off. You also don't know how I wait for you, how every day that passes without you or without an update becomes harder and harder.' She added: 'I can't explain how much it hurts to know that you are suffering, that you are hungry, that it is difficult for you - but that you are also strong. I want you to know that during this entire period you were not only shackled by your feet, but also in the hearts of everyone who loves you. I know that what happened and is happening to you in captivity is unimaginable, that you are going through one of the hardest things. And it is so hard to be here, without an option to make things easier for you, without being able to hug you.' 'Sometimes all I want is just the little moments – our conversations, our laughter, all our moments, the little things that made our lives so beautiful. I endure every moment in silence, because I know your pain is greater than mine. I know you don't know I'm here waiting, but I don't stop hoping and waiting. Every day. Every moment. For you to know that your pain is mine too. I love you, and all this time only increases my desire to bring you home, until we can hug each other again, that we can heal and feel alive again.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In an interview with Ynet, Eliya's mother, Sigi, expressed shock at the difficult conditions that were revealed. 'My stomach is turning and I'm in a crazy state. If we thought we knew something, then we didn't understand anything. The punch in the stomach that we had on Saturday night, with all the joy of the sign of life we ​​received, I couldn't imagine how bad the situation they were in was.' Is the government suppressing the difficult situation of the hostages? 'I really don't know. What interests me now is that my son returns and that everyone returns. The hostages who returned on Shabbat are proof that everyone, everyone who remained there, needs to return home today. If up until now they seemed to know and covered it up, now they can't cover it up. Look, people who look like Holocaust survivors have arrived here, and went through the Holocaust there. They all need to return home. That's more important than anything else.' What information did you receive about Eliya? 'We know that, thank God, Eliya is alive, we know that they have been chained from the day they were kidnapped until today, which is unimaginable. A person has been chained for a year and 4 months, and guards are standing over him with drawn weapons, and they haven't moved from him for a single second. They are treated like animals. They hardly receive food, don't see daylight, have been in tunnels from the day they were kidnapped until today. And I'm not talking about the abuse, I don't know what they went through there.' Regarding Phase II of the cease-fire and hostage release deal, which currently is being negotiated, she says: 'I am very, very worried. I was worried even before this deal was implemented, and I keep saying that until I look Elia in the eye and hug him, I won't believe anything. It's sad to hear that the second phase of the deal is also getting further away, because after what we saw on Saturday, the first thing that needs to be done is to bring them home.' What do you say to the ministers in the government who think that the photos actually strengthen their opposition to continuing the deal? 'I say to those people: You don't want to make a deal, no problem, don't do it. Put your child in there instead of my child and then say you don't want a deal. As long as your child is not there, you have no right, you have no right to keep these children there, you don't have this right and privilege.' What message did he want to convey? ' He said he misses us very, very much and he's really looking forward to going home.' First sign of life from Alon Yesterday, the family of the other hostage from the shelter near Kibbutz Be'eri, Alon Ohel, after 494 days received their first sign of life. The family was informed that Alon was alive as of Saturday, but emphasized that he has an eye injury which has not been treated, and has been held in chains for the entire period of captivity. The family received the testimony that he is alive from the hostages who were released on Saturday, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy, who had been held with him in the tunnels since the day of his abduction. Alon's family said he is being held in harsh conditions in tunnels inder Gaza, without daylight and without access to basic human necessities, and that he has an eye injury. His mother, Idit, told Ynet that 'the feelings are very complex and difficult; it is very shocking and on the other hand it is also very exciting that we know that Alon is alive.' She said that it is 'very shocking to understand what condition he is probably in, according to the hostages who have returned now. In fact, since the kidnapping, he has been in the tunnels all the time, he is being held captive in difficult conditions in terms of nutrition. He has an eye injury that we didn't know about: shrapnel in the eye and shrapnel in the shoulder. He was held throughout the entire period of captivity, chained, with almost no food, just one pita a day.' Alon's family said: 'We are devastated and shocked by the difficult physical and mental state he is in and the abuse he and the other hostages are still going through. Alon has survived the inferno so far, but he doesn't have time! The release of the hostages must not be postponed. They are all humanitarian.' Idit added in a conversation with Ynet that 'we must do everything and now to return them. They must all leave now, urgently. The men's condition is not good - it is not normal. It is humanitarian. We do not accept the selection that was made - and this injustice needs to be corrected.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1zq7sptyx	2025-02-10T01:04:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/Syr8BQvFyg/Syr8BQvFyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

The National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it sent an official notice to government agencies last week urging them to take security precautions over the artificial intelligence app. 'Unlike other generative AI services, it has been confirmed that chat records are transferable as it includes a function to collect keyboard input patterns that can identify individuals and communicate with Chinese companies' servers such as volceapplog.com,' the NIS said in a statement issued on Sunday. Some government ministries in South Korea have blocked access to the app, citing security concerns, joining Australia and Taiwan in warning about or placing restrictions on DeepSeek. The NIS said DeepSeek gives advertisers unlimited access to user data and stores South Korean users' data in Chinese servers. Under Chinese law, the Chinese government would be able to access such information when requested, the agency added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj2nkbwfjl	2025-02-09T23:56:50-08:00	
Gaza Hamas chief says Trump's plan for enclave 'doomed'	Hamas' Gaza chief Khalil al-Hayya said on Monday that the plans of the West, the United States and U.S. President Donald Trump for the Gaza Strip were 'doomed.' 'We will bring them down as we brought down the projects before them,' he said during a commemoration of the 46th anniversary of the Iranian revolution in Tehran. Trump said on Sunday he was committed to buying and owning Gaza, but could allow sections of the war-ravaged land to be rebuilt by other states in the Middle East.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1xrrndfkg	2025-02-09T23:55:02-08:00

End of the penny: Trump orders production of the copper coins sto...	Trump directs Treasury Department to stop production of the currency due to its high cost: 'This is so wasteful! Let's rip the waste out of our great nations budget, even if it's a penny at a time' President Donald Trump says he has directed the Treasury Department and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and to stop minting new pennies, citing the rising cost of producing the one-cent coin. 'For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful!' Trump wrote in a post on Sunday on is Truth Social site. 'I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies. Let's rip the waste out of our great nations budget, even if it's a penny at a time.' The move by Trump is the latest in what has been a rapid-fire effort by his new administration to enact sweeping change through executive order and proclamation on issues ranging from immigration, to gender and diversity, to the name of the Gulf of Mexico. Trump had not discussed his desire to eliminate the penny during his campaign. But Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency raised the prospect in a post on X last month highlighting the penny’s cost. The U.S. Mint reported losing $85.3 million in the 2024 fiscal year that ended in September on the nearly 3.2 billion pennies it produced. Every penny cost nearly $0.037 — up from $0.031 the year before. It is unclear whether Trump has the power to unilaterally eliminate the lowly one-cent coin. Currency specifications - including the size and metal content of coins - are dictated by Congress. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: But Robert K. Triest, an economics professor at Northeastern University, has argued that there might be wiggle room. 'The process of discontinuing the penny in the U.S. is a little unclear. It would likely require an act of Congress, but the Secretary of the Treasury might be able to simply stop the minting of new pennies,' he said last month. Members of Congress have repeatedly introduced legislation taking aim at the zinc coin with copper plating. Proposals over the years have attempted to temporarily suspend the penny’s production, eliminate it from circulation, or require that prices be rounded to the nearest five cents, according to the Congressional Research Service. Proponents of eliminating the coin have cited cost savings, speedier checkouts at cash registers, and the fact that a number of countries have already eliminated their one-cent coins. Canada, for instance, stopped minting its penny in 2012. It wouldn’t be the first time the U.S. eliminated its least valuable coin. The half-cent coin was discontinued by Congress in 1857. Trump’s new administration has been sharply focused on cutting costs, with Musk, who has been brought on to lead the task, targeting entire agencies and large swaths of the federal workforce as he tries to identify a goal of $2 trillion in savings. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by0iwedfyx	2025-02-09T23:38:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/BkyGoMvKke/BkyGoMvKke_0_243_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Romi Gonen's father writes ' Trump is reason my daughter is free ...	Eitan Gonen, whose daughter was released in current deal, thanked the U.S. president in a column in the New York Post: He 'applied the necessary pressure ... Only he can make the next stages of the deal possible' Gonen claimed; To the families whose loved ones were left behind, he said: 'Don’t lose hope. Keep fighting' 'The person who made seeing my daughter possible, after so many months of despair and failed negotiations, was President Donald Trump,' wrote Eitan Gonen, the father of former Hamas hostage Romi Gonen, who was released from captivity after 471 days , as part of the first phase of the current cease-fire and hostage release deal. In a column in the New York Post, he wrote that 'When he (Trump) set a Jan. 20 deadline for the deal, it applied the necessary pressure, setting in motion the events that would bring Romi home. I would be honored to shake his hand one day and express my gratitude for his role in reuniting our family.' Eitan Gonen opened the column by describing Romi's kidnapping: 'The morning of Oct. 7, 2023, is tattooed in our memory. For nearly five hours, I — along with Romi’s mother, Meirav, and our daughter, Yarden — spoke to Romi on the phone as chaos unfolded at the Nova music festival. With the roads blocked by abandoned and burned cars, the last we heard was that Romi was shot and that terrorists were near her. Then came the agonizing silence. 'Her friends who were with her had been murdered. For almost two months, we had no idea if she was even alive, until other hostages released in the first deal confirmed she had survived. For 470 days, I ended every interview I gave with the same message: 'Romi is coming home alive.' I didn’t know if she would hear me, but I kept saying it, hoping somehow my words would reach her. 'This mantra gave me no choice but to get up every day and fight. I had to be ready for her return every waking moment. Staying in bed and giving up was not an option,' he wrote. Gonen's column was written on Friday, before the fifth round of hostage releases the following day. But even then he understood the grave condition that the remaining hostages are in. 'President Trump is their only hope,' he wrote. 'Only he could help other families experience the reunion I had. Only he can make the next stages of the deal possible. After his intervention, the moment we had been fighting for arrived: When I got to speak with Romi in the hospital after her release on Jan. 19, her first words to me were: 'Dad, I came home alive!' Those words, which made everything worthwhile, confirmed what I had always believed — that our voices could reach across the void and give strength to those we love.' He added: 'My daughter’s strength continues to amaze me. She learned Arabic to communicate with her captors — it was her only way to survive. She found a crucial ally in Emily Damari, another hostage who had been taken from her home in Kfar Aza. God somehow brought them together, and their bond helped them both endure. 'The hardest lesson I learned was that hopelessness consumes energy you can’t afford to waste. I channeled every resource efficiently; every ounce of energy had to be directed toward bringing Romi home. I refused to stay in bed and cry. I knew Romi wouldn’t want to hear that her father had collapsed in her absence. Instead, I had to reinvent myself daily. My wife Meital and I spoke with more than 50,000 people across Israel, telling the story of Romi and the family. We printed t-shirts and distributed stickers — anything to keep Romi’s presence alive in the world.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Gonen's father is now looking forward and trying to strike a positive note for the parents whose children are still being held in Gaza. 'Now, as we begin the long journey of rehabilitation, we’re taking things at Romi’s pace. We’re giving her the autonomy and control that was taken from her for so long. Sometimes we just sit together in silence, touching, hugging, watching — simple moments I missed so desperately for all those many, many months,' he wrote. 'To all the other families still waiting for their loved ones: Don’t lose hope. Keep fighting, let your loved ones know they haven’t been forgotten. We cannot rest. We cannot celebrate fully until every last hostage returns home to their family.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sywxrqdfjg	2025-02-09T22:40:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/19/BygY811T5vyg/BygY811T5vyg_82_84_1131_637_0_small.jpg

With fragile cease-fires in place, Israel's economy shows signs o...	Despite not yet approving a national budget for 2025, a labor crisis, and a cease-fire that could collapse at any moment, Israel launched its postwar reconstruction efforts and there is economic optimism Following the cease-fires with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in the north, Israel swiftly launched its postwar reconstruction efforts. Thousands of civilian structures in war-affected areas require urgent rebuilding, but despite a general sense of optimism, the process is fraught with challenges. Multiple projects are already in place, such as the Tekuma (Revival) Administration, which has a five-year mandate and an initial allocation of 19 billion shekels ($5.3 billion) to rebuild devastated communities. Still, as of January 2025, Israel's state budget, totaling approximately 607.4 billion shekels ($170.9 billion), has yet to be approved and doesn’t have a precise slice dedicated to rebuilding war-torn regions. The country is at an impasse because it can’t know if military expenditures will become a priority again, considering the frail cease-fire. Despite the uncertainty, Israeli infrastructure companies have experienced a significant value surge. Danya Cebus’ market capitalization reached 3.71 billion shekels, an increase of 13.02% over the past year. Similarly, Shikun & Binui’s market capitalization of 6.78 billion shekels marks a 34.52% increase over the past year. According to Natanel Haiman, head of the Economics Division at the Manufacturers Association of Israel, recent economic trends show signs of recovery. 'Consumption is rising. Between September and November 2024, there was a 10.6% increase in industrial product purchases and a 4.6% rise in total credit card transactions. This reflects renewed consumer and business confidence.' Similarly, Eliran, a community leader from Ma’alot, said that there is a lot to do, but that progress is being made. 'The municipality is supporting the reconstruction of the damaged buildings, but it’s still taking time to see results on the ground,' he said. 'Roads and damaged infrastructure have already been repaired, but it’s more complicated in the community. Many people have been financially impacted and still haven’t managed to recover. We have an economic aid fund through which we have helped several people, but it’s not enough.' Unfortunately for Israel’s reconstruction plans, the postwar stability depends on a fragile ceasefire, which also impacts the economic revival. Dr. Roby Nathanson, CEO of the Macro Center for Political Economy, explains that the reconstruction process isn’t just rebuilding the destroyed physical structures but also economic revival. 'Reconstruction cannot succeed without revitalizing the business sector. People will not return to places without employment or income opportunities. In my view, that is the greatest challenge,' he said. Chen Herzog, chief economist at BDO, emphasizes that while security stabilization offers a pathway for economic recovery, challenges remain. '2024 was a tough year economically, with a per capita growth decline of 1.5%, meaning Israelis became poorer in real terms,' Herzog explains. He adds that economic measures, including a hike in value-added tax from 17% to 18%, higher income taxes, and reduced welfare payments, are weighing on the Israeli public. 'We need an effective budget allocation for reconstruction to ensure economic rebound. But as of now, Israel is still operating under last year’s budget framework.' Nathanson also agrees with the urgency of the national budget for 2025. 'The government must pass the budget by the end of March; otherwise, the government could fall. This budget primarily addresses defense and urgent needs but includes very little for recovery programs, economic growth, productivity or business reactivation,' he said. However, even when Israel has a new budget for 2025 if the cease-fire collapses, the economy will take another severe hit, Haiman warns. 'If war resumes, businesses will be thrown back into crisis. The key is maintaining a stable cease-fire to allow for sustainable economic recovery.' 'In 2024, Israel saw 65,000 businesses close, while only 35,000 new businesses were established. In normal years, we see about 50,000 openings to 40,000 closures. This is a major issue,' Nathanson added. The north of Israel, which was heavily hit by Hezbollah missile attacks, remains the most economically devastated region. According to Nathanson, of the 150,000 businesses in the north, about 80,000 are in the Upper Galilee, the hardest-hit region. 'For businesses in the north, this is a matter of survival. Around 50% of businesses in the restaurant and service industries had to close, and 25% will never reopen. Reconstruction cannot succeed without revitalizing the business sector.' This economic instability is not just regional – it is reshaping national recovery efforts. As Nathanson highlights: 'If schools don’t reopen, teachers don’t return. If businesses stay shut, families won’t come back. The entire system is interdependent.' Alongside the complexities of economic revival, Israel has to deal with its ongoing labor shortage, which existed even before the war and worsened significantly since October 7. The country’s previous reliance on Palestinian workers left an 80,000-worker shortfall, stalling reconstruction efforts nationwide. While the government has attempted to fill the gap with foreign labor from Sri Lanka, India and other countries, Nathanson warns that 'reinstating some level of Palestinian employment may be inevitable. This labor crisis is also fueling soaring housing prices – before the war, a young couple needed around 80 times their annual income to buy an apartment; now, that figure has climbed to 150-160 times.' Herzog further highlights the strain on the real estate sector, noting that housing starts have dropped dramatically, with 'only 20,000 to 30,000 units being built annually, while 60,000 new families enter the housing market each year – a gap that will continue to drive prices even higher.' Eliran from Ma’alot confirmed the expert’s concerns as he believes 'there is a labor shortage. There are structures like shelters that need thorough repairs but have not yet been taken care of due to a lack of manpower and resources.' New building regulations have been implemented in affected areas to make things easier and faster and to handle the workforce shortage. Eliran from Ma’alot said they 'have several community members who have recently built reinforced security rooms (mamads) with less bureaucracy. With the approval of the Home Front Command, the planning committee immediately granted building permits. I assume these have been approved by an engineer.' Along with other measures that could facilitate the rebuilding and revival, Nathanson believes Israel has a very high interest rate (4.5%) and should consider lowering it. 'If the interest rate is reduced, it could provide a significant boost to economic recovery, investment and business activity. Debt servicing will increase, but reducing interest rates now could provide a crucial economic stimulus, especially for construction and business recovery,' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Similarly, Herzog believes that lowering interest rates could help, but for that to happen, 'Israel needs confidence that inflation and the government deficit are under control. Right now, that’s not the case. The Bank of Israel cannot reduce interest rates because of uncertainty about the government budget and national debt targets. Israel’s risk premium needs to come down, and the rating agencies need to have confidence in Israel’s financial stability before we can expect lower interest rates.' That said, 'a continued cease-fire is already strengthening the shekel. A stronger shekel makes imported goods cheaper, which in turn helps lower inflation. If this trend continues, we might see the Bank of Israel considering interest rate reductions in 2025’s second half,' he added. Israel’s strong macroeconomic sectors, such as high-tech, military industries, energy and communications, have 'remained stable, and the stock exchange even rose during the war, and the shekel, while weakened, has been recovering,' Nathanson added. As Israel’s reconstruction process begins, its conditions remain uncertain. From an ice-thin ceasefire to an unclear national budget and a lack of workforce, Israel faces a crossroads that could redefine the country for decades to come, for the better or the worse. As Haiman said: 'While the current conditions foster optimism and growth, the Israeli business community must be prepared to navigate uncertainty regardless of the circumstances.'

Fighter jets attacked the underground tunnel in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley used by the terrorist organization, which has been targeted in the past; IDF says it is 'determined to prevent its restoration and use'; Report on injuries in Lebanon says 'Israel is coordinating its attacks with al-Julani's men' Israeli Air Force fighter conducted a precise intelligence-based strike on an underground tunnel crossing from Syrian territory into Lebanese territory that was used by Hezbollah to smuggle weapons in the Beqaa area and has been struck in the past, the IDF spokesman reported late Sunday night. 'The IDF is determined to prevent the restoration and use of this tunnel,' the IDF spokesman said. Additionally, the IAF struck several Hezbollah sites containing munitions and rocket launchers that posed an imminent threat in Lebanese territory. The targets struck were a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon, according to the IDF. 'The IDF continues to operate to remove any threat to the State of Israel, in accordance with the ceasefire understandings. The IDF remains committed to the understandings and will operate to prevent any attempt of rearmament or rebuild of force by the Hezbollah terrorist organization,' the IDF spokesman said. At the same time, in Lebanon, the Al-Jadeed channel reported fighter jets in the skies over Beirut and Dahieh. The Lebanese NBN network also reported Israeli attacks between the villages of Harbata and Sabona in the northern Bekaa region. According to a Lebanese report, one of the attacks in Lebanon targeted the Khalid al-Saba crossing area in Al-Hermel, which was described as 'an area that witnessed a failed attempt two days ago by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham to control it.' The Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, affiliated with Hezbollah, reported that in addition to the Khalid al-Sabah crossing, the Zaqba crossing was also attacked - two crossings between Syria and Lebanon in the Al-Hermel area in the north and deep of the country. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another report, by the Sabereen News agency affiliated with the pro-Iranian militias, stated that several people were injured in attacks in the border area and were taken to the hospital for treatment. According to the report, this is an area where there have been clashes in recent days between Syrian regime forces and elements supported by Hezbollah. The report said that in its attacks, Israel 'is coordinating with the people of al-Julani,' referring to Syrian rebel leader and interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa. The attacks deep inside Lebanon come hours after Ynet reported that the IDF decided that from March 1 residents of the north will not be prevented from returning to return to their homes. Ynet learned that the IDF delivered the professional opinion today, after an updated situation assessment. In addition, the attack comes nine days before the IDF is scheduled to evacuate and completely withdraw from southern Lebanon on February 18, in accordance with the cease-fire agreement. Army forces are scheduled to completely withdraw from all points Israel has captured in southern Lebanon, including those with important strategic-security significance for the lives of residents of the north. In light of the residents' concerns, the IDF promises that it will ensure that the villages that will be built will no longer serve as a shelter for terrorism, and that it will act to stop any attempt to restore the security threat by occupying and firing at Lebanese border settlements. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1i1ugdkkg	2025-02-09T21:27:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/09/Hy3bnKLF1l/Hy3bnKLF1l_0_0_441_248_0_small.jpg

Robert Kraft’s Super Bowl ad shines a light on hate for a second ...	The NFL experienced extremely high viewership compared to previous years for several reasons Yesterday was Super Bowl Sunday, and millions of Americans prepared for the epic game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs in what marked the 59th annual NFL championship. The NFL experienced extremely high viewership compared to previous years for several reasons. The first was the rematch of the 2023 Super Bowl, which ended dramatically with a last-second touchdown. This year’s showdown promised to be just as thrilling. In the end, the Philadelphia Eagles took out the Kansas City Chiefs by a score of 40 to 22. Another major draw was the halftime show, featuring iconic rapper Kendrick Lamar. Fresh off a successful Grammy campaign with his hit song Not Like Us—a diss track in his viral feud with Canadian rapper Drake—Lamar’s performance attracted even non-football fans. It had the potential to be one of the most-watched halftime shows in NFL history. With millions of American eyes on the event, Robert Kraft, a longtime supporter of Israel, secured an incredibly expensive Super Bowl ad slot. His foundation, the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, aired an ad for the second consecutive year. While last year’s ad focused primarily on antisemitism with stark imagery, this year’s campaign highlighted all forms of hate without directly mentioning antisemitism. Seven-time NFL champion Tom Brady appeared alongside legendary rapper Snoop Dogg, engaging in a heated conversation about the dangers of hate. Dan Kraft, son of Robert Kraft, told ILTV that his goal was to introduce the issue of antisemitism to people who might not be aware of it.

Media bias and moral failure: How CNN, BBC, and the UN enable Ham...	Comment: Hamas's PR stunt backfired. The world was shocked to see the three male hostages emaciated, shells of their former selves. Complete with a new banner, a stage, rows of pickup trucks, and terrorists in full Hamas gear—all carefully orchestrated and choreographed by none other than Qatar’s Al Jazeera. But the PR stunt backfired as the three Israeli hostages—Or Levy, Eli Sharabi, and Ohad Ben Ami—exited the Hamas vehicle and were paraded on stage. The world was shocked to see the three men—emaciated, shells of their former selves. It was a stark reminder of the cruelty, savagery, and evil that is Hamas—images reminiscent of the darkest days in human history. And while the world had pledged 'Never Again,' these images, these men, prove it has utterly failed to uphold that promise. And while most of the world was truly shocked, there were those who sought to downplay these crimes against humanity. CNN and the BBC—once respectable news organizations—the BBC actually referred to 'both sides' hostages,' and CNN stated that Palestinian prisoners sometimes look emaciated too. Really? First of all—let’s be clear. Palestinian prisoners are convicted criminals. They have had trials. They have had due process. They regularly receive visits from the Red Cross. They have access to medical care and full, nutritious meals every single day. It is deeply concerning that a news outlet cannot tell the difference between good and evil, between terrorists and convicted felons who have raped and murdered, and the innocent civilians who were literally dragged out of their beds in their underwear on a Saturday morning, a holiday, their families murdered. These headlines, and any attempts to draw a moral equivalence between terrorists and Israeli civilians, only play into Hamas’s PR stunts and enable scenes like the one on Saturday to unfold. It props up a terrorist group that carried out one of the most barbaric massacres in modern history. So, good job to the CNN and BBC editors who thought these were balanced headlines. And they are not alone. In fact, they’re in good company. How can we not mention the International Red Cross, the United Nations, and so many so-called human rights organizations that have not said a single word about the hostages? The Red Cross—other than transporting the hostages from point A to point B and fully participating in Hamas’s PR show—has not visited a single hostage in nearly 16 months. The United Nations—the international organization that was supposed to ensure 'Never Again'—has yet to condemn Hamas. Instead, it continually tries to draw some sort of moral equivalence between innocent Israeli hostages and a brutal terrorist organization. The UN, perhaps more than any agency, supports and enables Hamas and scenes like the one on Saturday. So the fact that all these organizations are still trying to 'both sides' it is outrageous and extremely dangerous. All they are doing is empowering Hamas and allowing their evil ideology to spread unchecked throughout the world. And everyone with a basic sense of morality and a basic sense of right vs. wrong should speak up. It’s time to put a stop to this ridiculous show and bring home all the hostages now—before it is too late. Never Again is now.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk7rpbwyje	2025-02-09T20:30:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/yk14252784/yk14252784_0_51_1438_810_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu, Trump aligned on Israel’s Phase II hostage deal terms,...	Israeli delegation in Doha working to facilitate hostage releases and prevent violations; Phase II talks to begin after upcoming Cabinet meeting, with demands including Hamas’ expulsion, disarmament and full hostage release Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to bring Israel’s demands for the second phase of the hostage deal to the decision-making Security Cabinet for approval on Tuesday. According to Israeli assessments, Hamas is unlikely to accept the conditions, which include the exile of its leadership from Gaza, the disarmament of its military wing and the release of all remaining hostages. If met, these terms would mark the end of Israel’s military operations in Gaza. Negotiations on the second phase will only begin after the Cabinet convenes. Meanwhile, the Israeli delegation currently in Doha, Qatar, is focused solely on implementing the first phase of the agreement. The delegation, which includes Hostage and Missing Persons Coordinator Gal Hirsch and a senior Shin Bet official, is working to ensure the continuation of the first-phase releases while preventing further violations. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israel expects three more male hostages to be released in the next exchange, though there is growing concern that, as seen on Saturday, some may return in severely deteriorated physical condition. Netanyahu has already reached understandings on the second-phase principles with U.S. President Donald Trump and his Middle East envoy, Steven Witkoff. However, given Hamas’ expected refusal, Israel will likely push to extend the first phase as long as possible to secure additional hostage releases and maintain the temporary cease-fire. An Israeli official said that in response to Hamas’ strategy of starving the hostages, Israel has been taking countermeasures, primarily by delaying the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. However, the official emphasized that Netanyahu would not abandon the deal, though Hamas would 'face consequences later.' 'We may be swallowing some bitter pills now, but Hamas will pay for this,' the official said. He added that Israel remains committed to freeing all hostages, whether through negotiations or by resuming military action. 'The war is not the goal—it is a means to bring our hostages home, one way or another,' he said. Post-war plan As negotiations for the second phase of the hostage deal progress, it is increasingly seen as the start of the 'day after' in Gaza. Hamas’ demands for this phase have repeatedly crossed Israel’s red lines. The terror group’s primary condition for releasing the remaining 65 Israeli and foreign hostages—considered its last bargaining chip—is a complete and unconditional end to the war. Hamas is demanding a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the unrestricted transfer of billions of dollars from international donors for reconstruction. If Hamas refuses to extend the current phase, and it concludes with the release of 33 hostages, Israel may face a difficult choice: resume military operations while 65 hostages remain in captivity under dire conditions, or move to the second phase under Hamas’ terms. Recent testimonies from released hostages have detailed severe mistreatment and torture in captivity, adding pressure on the Israeli government. Accepting Hamas' demands would also create political turmoil for Prime Minister Netanyahu. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and his far-right Religious Zionist Party have already warned that once the first phase ends, they will push for a full resumption of military operations and Hamas’ destruction. Smotrich reiterated his opposition Sunday, calling Hamas’ conditions a dangerous precedent. 'What happens next? Terror groups will kidnap more Israelis and demand a withdrawal from Judea and Samaria, the evacuation of settlements and a Palestinian state in return? This is a red line that must not be crossed,' he said. He also criticized Israel’s previous concessions, including withdrawing from the Netzarim Corridor and allowing Gazans to return to northern Gaza, calling them 'temporary and reversible.' However, he warned against further compromises. 'This bright red line must not be crossed. We will not be forced into political concessions as part of a hostage deal,' Smotrich said. 'No responsible leader surrenders to political dictates in such a deal. Anyone who does so is unfit to lead. Our government will not submit to this madness.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h111bjoitjg	2025-02-09T13:36:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/SJ00TBNgY1g/SJ00TBNgY1g_1_50_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Trump to announce 25% steel and aluminum tariffs in latest trade ...	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he will announce on Monday new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., which would come on top of existing metals duties in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul. Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday to take effect almost immediately. Trump during his first term imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum, but later granted several trading partners duty-free quotas, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil. Former President Joe Biden extended these quotas to Britain, Japan and the European Union, and U.S. steel mill capacity utilization has dropped in recent years. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that the new tariffs would come on top of the existing duties on steel and aluminum. On Friday, Trump announced that he would impose reciprocal tariffs—raising U.S. tariff rates to match those of trading partners—in many countries this week. He did not identify the countries, but the duties would be imposed 'so that we're treated evenly with other countries.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byj11cilyke	2025-02-09T13:21:29-08:00

Speaking to reporters before boarding Air Force One, Trump said, 'We will turn Gaza into a prime site for future development,' emphasizing his intention to reshape the reality on the ground. Elaborating on his ambitious plan, Trump pledged to 'take care of the Palestinians and ensure they are not killed.' When asked about the possibility of the United States accepting Palestinian refugees, he said, 'We will review each case individually,' but stopped short of committing to a comprehensive policy.

Jewish convert and the Star of David ring that sparked controvers...	In 2016, US deputy Mideast envoy to criticized Trump’s foreign policy but later became supporter; announcing her appointment, Trump remarked, 'I hope she learned her lesson'; Ortagus has strong ties to top Trump allies, including Kushner and Rubio Morgan Ortagus, the newly appointed deputy to U.S. presidential envoy to the Middle East, Steven Witkoff, arrived in Israel on Sunday following high-level meetings in Lebanon. Her visit comes as tensions rise over Hezbollah’s role in the newly formed Lebanese government and the fragile cease-fire with Israel. Ortagus, who previously served as the State Department’s spokesperson during Donald Trump's first term, was given responsibility for Lebanese affairs, replacing Amos Hochstein. In Israel, she met with Defense Minister Israel Katz and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, whose office is overseeing her visit. She also toured an IDF post in Lebanon alongside Katz. She is expected to leave the region on Monday. Her appointment by Trump in early January was notable for the president’s lukewarm endorsement, writing in his announcement that Ortagus 'fought me for three years, but hopefully has learned her lesson.' While he did not specify the disagreements, reports suggest they stemmed from Ortagus' early criticism of Trump's isolationist foreign policy during the 2016 campaign. However, she later became a vocal supporter after he secured the Republican nomination. In her first public mission since taking office, Ortagus met with newly elected Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and top government officials. She pressed them to prevent Hezbollah from holding ministerial positions, warning that the cease-fire with Israel remains 'fragile' and that any flare-up could end it entirely. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Speaking at a press conference in Beirut, Ortagus said the U.S. has set 'clear red lines' for Lebanon’s new government, insisting Hezbollah must have no role. 'Lebanon’s leaders are committed to ensuring Hezbollah is not part of the government in any way. That era is over. Israel has succeeded in defeating Hezbollah, and we commend them for it,' she said. Despite her remarks, Lebanon's new government was announced on Saturday, with Hezbollah and its Shiite ally, the Amal Movement, securing five ministerial posts. Her visit also sparked controversy in Lebanon due to a ring she wore prominently during meetings—a Star of David. Lebanese social media users took notice, with one commenting on X (formerly Twitter), 'This envoy is even more Zionist than her predecessors.' Hezbollah-aligned MP Hassan Ezzedine condemned her comments on Hezbollah, accusing her of 'endorsing enemy crimes.' Small protests erupted outside Beirut’s airport upon her departure. Ortagus, 42, has a diverse background in diplomacy, intelligence and media. She was born in Florida to a cleaning business owner and an office manager and once placed third in the Miss Florida pageant. She holds a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of South Florida and a master’s degree in business administration and international relations from Johns Hopkins University. Ironically, she began her career as a public affairs officer for USAID, the same agency Trump later sought to dismantle. During her diplomatic service in the Middle East, she developed an interest in Judaism, ultimately converting. She married businessman Jonathan Weinberger in 2013 in a ceremony officiated by Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a longtime neighbor. The couple has a five-year-old daughter, Adina. Ortagus later worked as an intelligence analyst and deputy attaché at the Treasury Department, as well as a commentator for Fox News. Before becoming State Department spokesperson under then-secretary of state Mike Pompeo, she served as a Navy Reserve officer in Saudi Arabia. As spokesperson, she was known for her tough stance on Iran and China, particularly in countering Beijing’s attempts to shift blame for the COVID-19 pandemic onto the U.S. Trump’s decision to appoint her as Witkoff’s deputy despite past tensions appears to have been influenced by her strong ties to key Republican figures, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Senator Lindsey Graham and incoming National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. She also worked closely with Jared Kushner during the Abraham Accords negotiations, and the two remain on good terms. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syepxouyke	2025-02-09T13:08:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/07/BJgH11ZYmtkl/BJgH11ZYmtkl_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Israel strikes Hezbollah weapons tunnel on Syria-Lebanon border	Israeli warplanes struck an underground tunnel in Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley that crosses from Syria and was used by Hezbollah for smuggling weapons, the IDF said Sunday. 'The tunnel was previously targeted, and the IDF is determined to prevent its restoration and use,' the military said. The airstrikes also hit Hezbollah sites containing weapon stockpiles and rocket launchers posing an immediate threat in Lebanon. The targets violated understandings between Israel and Lebanon, the military said. Lebanon’s Hezbollah-affiliated Al Manar TV reported strikes near the village of Rumin in the Nabatieh province of southern Lebanon. Lebanese media also reported airstrikes across the country, including areas north of the Litani River, with fighter jets spotted over Beirut and the Hezbollah stronghold of Dahieh. The pro-Iranian Sabereen News agency reported several injuries in the al-Hermel region near the Syria-Lebanon border, with casualties taken to hospitals. The area has recently seen clashes between Syrian regime forces and Hezbollah-backed factions in Lebanon. According to the report, the Israeli strikes were 'coordinated with the Syrian regime.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk2fp9ifjg	2025-02-09T12:25:22-08:00

Hamas has ordered systematic starvation of male hostages, freed c...	Brother of released hostage Or Levy says 'for 16 months, he was barefoot, hungry and in constant fear that each day might be his last'; another brother rejects claims leadership unaware of intentional starvation policy Tal Levy, the brother of Or Levy, who was freed from Hamas captivity, described the harsh conditions and starvation his brother endured during his 491-day captivity. 'There was intentional starvation, a policy from Yahya Sinwar,' he said. 'It’s impossible that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu didn’t know because officials from the Hostages Bureau at the Prime Minister's Office told us about it,' Tal added that, in his estimation, Or wouldn't have survived much longer if he had remained in captivity for another two to three weeks or a month. Meanwhile, Or's other brother, Michael, issued a statement at Sheba Medical Center, also placing the blame on decision-makers. 'Yesterday, after 491 days of hell, Or came back to us,' Michael said. 'He was imprisoned in Hamas tunnels, cut off from the world, from his life, from his family. For 491 days, every minute was a battle—physical, mental, emotional.' Michael went on to describe Or's physical state, saying, 'After a year and four months, I saw my brother again. I hugged him, but he wasn’t the same Or who left home on October 7, 2023. Or returned in a weakened condition. For 16 months, he was barefoot, hungry, and in constant fear that each day would be his last.' Michael continued, 'His greatest fear was confirmed when he was freed. For 491 days, he waited to hear about his wife, Einav. He learned only yesterday that she was murdered. Yesterday, he finally met Almog, and Almog asked, 'Why did it take so long for you to come back?' For 491 days, my brother and others were there, but nothing prepared them for what they found here. While Or was in the dark, decision-makers knew about his condition but didn’t do everything they should have.' Michael stressed the urgency of continuing the fight to bring more hostages home. 'Every moment and every second there was critical. Our struggle isn't over. Or’s return is a miracle, but the people of Israel deserve this miracle. My brother is here, but I still have other brothers and sisters in hell. I beg, don’t forget them. Don’t stop fighting.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Earlier, Tal Levy spoke to Keshet News about Or's gradual recovery. 'Or is recovering slowly,' he said. 'Yesterday was a bit harder and confusing for him, but he didn’t sleep much. He sat with my mom and my brother and shared experiences from captivity. He fell asleep only at 7 a.m. Yesterday was confusing, but he’s going through a process. Today is a better day, he’s starting to stabilize.' Tal further revealed, 'The stories he shares are incredibly difficult to hear. I can’t even describe them. If I could share everything he told us and if the public knew what they went through and the slim chances they had to survive in those conditions... the Or I saw yesterday wouldn't have survived another two or three weeks, or a month in captivity.' Tal also confirmed that Or had been aware of the intentional starvation policy imposed by Yahya Sinwar, a policy the family had been briefed on. 'This is not the first time we’ve heard about this,' Tal said. 'Yesterday, there were briefings from the Prime Minister’s Office where they claimed they didn’t know about the intentional starvation. But I can say unequivocally that they did know. The prime minister knew. A few months ago, official sources from the Defense Ministry and the military came to us and told us about this top-down policy, with Sinwar ordering the starvation of male hostages. It’s impossible that the families and we were exposed to this, and the Prime Minister wasn’t.' Tal added that Or had initially refused to be freed and suggested another hostage be released instead. 'He felt very bad about being freed while others were still in captivity. We told him that he was a humanitarian case, especially because of Almog, who lost his mother, and Or was the family’s only hope.' Or also mentioned Elkana Bochbot, another hostage, who had a 4-year-old daughter, saying, 'Why wasn’t he released?' Or didn’t know for certain until yesterday that his wife, Einav, had been killed. Tal said that, at his request, a psychologist broke the news to him. 'He guessed she was dead because he was in the shelter when it happened. He suspected she was gone, but he didn’t know. The first question he asked the psychologist, after transitioning to the IDF, was whether Einav was alive or dead. She confirmed she was dead,' Tal explained. Tal also described the emotional meeting between Or and Almog. 'Almog recognized him immediately. The fear wasn’t just ours—it was Or’s too. He was really afraid Almog wouldn’t recognize him. He said the one thing that kept him going every day in captivity was dreaming of meeting Almog. As time went on, he started to think that Almog might not recognize him, and the reunion he had been dreaming about would be very cold and hard. But Almog remembered him completely. He had been longing to meet him, and the reunion was incredible. It was truly the most emotional moment of my life. It was as if they hadn’t been apart.' Or also got the chance to tuck Almog in for the first time. 'It was the first time he went to bed with his father. This was a dream his father had every night during captivity. He dreamed of putting Almog to bed, and today I’m helping him do it,' Tal said. 'We’ll all lie down together in bed and read a story, and they’ll sleep hugging.' Or, along with Eli Sharabi, who lost his entire family in the terror attack, and Ohad Ben Ami, who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be'eri in his pajamas, was freed from the heart of the Gaza Strip. The three had been held underground for most of their captivity, without daylight. Some were exposed to limited media, mostly Al Jazeera. When Michael Levy addressed the UN Security Council, Hamas terrorists informed Or that the Israeli official was working on his behalf. About a week before their release, the hostages began receiving more food and water, likely due to supplies entering the area and the terrorists wanting to present them as healthier. Or was kidnapped on October 7 from the 'shelter of death' where he had fled with his wife Einav and many others during the Hamas surprise attack at the Nova party. His wife was killed in that shelter, along with 15 other victims. Yesterday, Or finally returned home and reunited with his 3-year-old son, Almog, but also received the devastating news of his wife's death in the shelter. 'He was held in a tunnel without communication and only guessed that his wife, Einav, had been murdered. He asked, and they told him,' his mother, Geula, said yesterday. Or's mother added that he thought Almog Sarusi, who was killed alongside five other hostages in a tunnel, had been freed. 'He was convinced that Almog and Hirsh had returned,' she said. Tonight, it was revealed that Alon Ahal, who had been kidnapped with Or from the shelter, is also alive. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkvvqtuk1l	2025-02-09T11:53:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/HyBwakgHKyl/HyBwakgHKyl_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg
Iranian schools and offices shut as cold snap bites	Tehran orders widespread closures due to severe snowstorm and energy conservation efforts, affecting schools and government offices in 10 provinces State media reported that authorities in Iran ordered schools and offices in at least 10 provinces to close on Sunday to conserve energy during a severe cold snap and heavy snowfall. Freezing temperatures have gripped the northern half of the country over the past few days, causing a spike in energy consumption. 'All government offices and schools are closed on Sunday, and remote learning has been arranged for students,' the state news agency IRNA announced. Among the provinces affected are Lorestan in the west, Semnan in the east and Gilan in the north. Some parts of Gilan, around 130 kilometres (80 miles) north of Tehran, saw snowfall to a depth of 220 centimetres (87 inches), meteorologist Mohammad Dadras told the Fars news agency. The shutdown decision followed a similar measure on Saturday, when authorities ordered closures in more than 20 of the country's 31 provinces because of the extreme weather. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The capital also saw closures on Saturday but those affected reopened on Sunday -- a working day -- despite the wintry conditions. IRNA said on Sunday some areas of Tehran received up to 30 centimetres (12 inches) of snow overnight. The snowfall caused widespread traffic disruption, and some residents cleared snow as others enjoyed snowball fights in city parks. Snow is not unusual for Tehran in February, but the combination of heavy snow and sudden temperature drops caught many people off guard. Heavy snow and rain across most of the country on Sunday also led to road closures. IRNA reported travel disruptions in 25 provinces, with the heaviest impacts in the north and west where authorities advised people to stay at home for the next 24 hours. Temperatures in at least 19 provinces fell to zero degrees Celsius or lower on Sunday, IRNA said. Iran often orders educational institutions and offices to close during winter, citing extreme weather and fuel shortages. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rykzmtifkg	2025-02-09T11:26:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/09/S1AEgEIt1x/S1AEgEIt1x_0_218_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Israel to allow northern residents to return home amid security c...	Nearly 18 months after evacuations, military approves residents' return in under 3 weeks; Metula Council head slams move; 'This is total destruction for victory image, there is nothing to return to' The IDF decided on Sunday to lift restrictions on residents returning to their homes in northern Israel starting March 1, nearly a year and a half after they were evacuated due to Hezbollah attacks. The decision, revealed by the military following an updated situation assessment, has sparked strong opposition from local leaders. 'This is a double abandonment,' said David Azulay, head of the Metula Regional Council. 'For a year, Metula was nearly destroyed without any real response from Northern Command. Now, deciding to bring residents back in three weeks is ensuring its complete destruction—just for the sake of a so-called ‘victory photo’ that the government and military want to present. There is nothing to return to—neither militarily nor in terms of civilian infrastructure. And there is certainly no ‘victory photo.’ What we have are tragic images of the abandonment we endured before the ground maneuver even began.' Azulay urged that residents remain in temporary housing until at least June 1, citing extensive damage to homes. His concerns are shared by other northern leaders, especially as the military prepares to pull back its forces to the international border next week. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The move comes amid reported U.S. pressure on Israel to adhere to the withdrawal timeline. On Saturday, Israeli forces evacuated additional positions in the eastern sector, allowing the Lebanese army to enter areas near the border with the kibbutzim of Manara and Misgav Am—a development that has unsettled local residents. Azulay has urged them not to return. It remains unclear whether the government will enforce the return by cutting off financial support for displaced families. The situation highlights a broader challenge in the northern theater. Unlike in Gaza, where the military has struggled to secure a decisive victory over Hamas, Israel’s confrontation with Hezbollah ended in a military success. However, it has yet to yield a political agreement that ensures long-term security. Unlike the Gaza cease-fire deal, no exclusion zone has been established in southern Lebanon to prevent Hezbollah or Lebanese civilians from entering the border area. While Northern Command has observed increased Lebanese army action against Hezbollah compared to pre-war levels, officials say more time is needed to solidify deterrence. Meanwhile, Hezbollah and its allies, including the Shiite Amal movement, have gained political influence, securing five ministerial positions in Lebanon’s newly formed government. The terrorist group is also working to rebuild its military capabilities, prompting continued Israeli airstrikes on Hezbollah targets. It remains uncertain whether these strikes will continue—and at what frequency—once the IDF completes its withdrawal under the cease-fire agreement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkthmyuyyx	2025-02-09T11:23:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/ry4f00suNVyx/ry4f00suNVyx_1_55_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Jerusalem court freezes billions in Palestinian Authority funds f...	Victims claim in lawsuits PA encourages terrorism against Israel; District Court rules each entitled to millions in compensation The Jerusalem District Court issued on Sunday a temporary freeze on approximately NIS 2.8 billion ($760 million) in funds for the Palestinian Authority (PA), following a lawsuit filed by hundreds of victims of the October 7 Hamas attack and the subsequent war. The court ruled that the plaintiffs, who include survivors and relatives of victims, have a legal basis to claim compensation under Israel’s Compensation for Terror Victims Law. The ruling determined that each plaintiff is entitled, at this stage, to at least NIS 5 million ($1.35 million) in damages. As a result, the freeze on PA assets was increased by an additional NIS 2.72 billion ($740 million), in line with previous decisions on similar cases against the PA and Hamas. The lawsuit, led by attorney David Simana, represents individuals who suffered physical or psychological harm in the October 7 terror attack. Many of the plaintiffs reside in communities near Gaza and argue that the PA has long encouraged terrorism against Israel. The frozen funds are held by the Israeli government. Court rejects Palestinian Authority’s appeal The ruling follows a recent Israeli Supreme Court decision rejecting a PA petition to overturn a law allowing terror victims to sue those who finance attacks. Yitzhak Amit, who presided over the case, stated that the PA provides financial support to terrorists and their families in direct connection to their acts of violence. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The PA claims a violation of its rights, but this alleged harm stems from its own decision to financially reward murderers whose hands are stained with the blood of innocent Israelis,' Amit wrote. 'The PA has the option to choose a different path and end its policy of incentivizing terrorism.' In its appeal, the PA had argued that it faced nearly 180 lawsuits from Israeli victims, with potential damages amounting to billions of shekels. The Supreme Court rejected the appeal, ruling that even if the law had political motivations, it did not justify its annulment. Attorney Simana welcomed the district court’s decision, calling it a significant step for victims of terror. 'This is the largest asset freeze ever granted in a terror victims’ lawsuit,' Simana said. 'We will continue to stand with bereaved families and survivors in this fight against terrorism.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj7wmd8tkl	2025-02-09T10:15:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/05/rkZr11uRD11kl/rkZr11uRD11kl_1_206_1970_1108_0_small.jpg
Hisham's family awaits his return after a decade in captivity: 'W...	Nothing is certain until he’s home,' says father of Hisham al-Sayed, set for release after decade in Gaza; 'We’ll hope only when we reunite'; His family last saw proof of life in 2022; now, he is included in the first phase of the hostage deal Sha’aban al-Sayed is approaching his 65th birthday, but for nearly a decade, he has not seen his son, Hisham, who is being held captive in Gaza. 'We haven’t prepared anything for his return,' al-Sayed told Ynet on Sunday. 'After 10 years, we’ve learned that nothing is certain until it happens.' The last time he saw Hisham was the day he disappeared. 'We talked like usual—just small talk,' al-Sayed recalled. 'I went to work, and he stayed home. He had no set routine; he would wander and then come back.' Hisham, a Bedouin from southern Israel, was born on Feb. 15, 1988. His father hopes he will return in time for his upcoming birthday. He crossed into Gaza in 2015 and was captured by Hamas. Now, he is expected to be released in the first phase of a hostage deal. 'We just want to see him first—then we’ll think about what comes next,' al-Sayed said. 'We’re not getting our hopes up. I’ll start allowing myself to feel when I see him. Until then, I’ve locked those emotions away.' His wife, he added, has taken a similar approach. 'She’s struggling emotionally. She doesn’t know what to feel.' The last sign of life from Hisham came in 2022 when Hamas released footage of him in Gaza, connected to an oxygen tank. 'Seeing that video didn’t give us hope—it just confirmed he was alive,' al-Sayed said. 'Hamas claimed he was very ill, but at least we got proof of life.' The Hostage and Missing Persons Families Forum has been in contact with the family, al-Sayed said, and they find some comfort in staying connected with other hostage families. 'We don’t need the government—we’re just waiting for this deal to go through,' he said. 'The uncertainty is a nightmare.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Al-Sayed said he has watched previous hostage releases but remains cautious. 'The worry has always been there. It doesn’t change anything for me because we still have no information about him,' he said. 'Before Oct. 7, the country was different. After the attack, anything is possible.' He described his son as strong but said his mental illness had complicated his situation. Al-Sayed also praised Gal Hirsch, Israel’s coordinator for captives and missing persons. 'He’s one of the best coordinators we’ve had. He tries to stay emotionally connected to the families, and I feel he’s doing his best,' he said. 'Whenever I ask him something, he answers honestly, without political spin.' According to al-Sayed, Hirsch told him Hamas had repeatedly sabotaged negotiations before the latest deal was finalized. 'There was information about this deal six months ago,' he said. 'Hirsch was upfront about what was happening. He explained that Hamas had derailed talks multiple times before the final agreement.' Alongside Israeli media, al-Sayed follows both pro- and anti-Hamas Arabic news sources. 'I cross-check information,' he said. 'Our government has been trying to make a deal all along. Hamas blocked it and then blamed the government. Their goal is to create chaos.' He noted that Hamas dictated the order of hostage releases—prioritizing women, the elderly, the sick, and the deceased. 'I don’t care if Hisham is number two or number five,' he said. 'Avraham Mengistu is in the same category as my son—both are civilians with health conditions. There’s a difference between soldiers and sick civilians.' Since the Oct. 7 terror attack, al-Sayed has connected with many other hostage families who are now experiencing what his family has endured for a decade. 'We met Ethiopian families and families of soldiers. We didn’t feel any difference between us,' he said. 'The sheer number of hostages was shocking. It took me two weeks to process what had happened.' When the Hostage and Missing Persons Families first reached out, he hesitated to join. 'I didn’t know what to do,' he admitted. 'After so many disappointments, it took me time to connect. I can’t attend every event, but we try to stay in touch with all families—regardless of politics. The world has changed, and we’re focused on people, not political agendas.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by8dj00iyyx	2025-02-09T10:09:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/06/28/HJo2AoO59/HJo2AoO59_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Smotrich: 'Second phase of hostage deal—red line'	Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Sunday reiterated his opposition to any political concessions as part of a hostage release deal. 'We must not cross this red line—we are not compelled to make political moves in exchange for hostages,' he said. Smotrich argued that Israel has never made policy decisions in response to abductions and should not start now. 'If we cross this red line and sign the second phase of the deal, what’s next? Terror groups will kidnap more Israelis and demand a withdrawal from Judea and Samaria, the evacuation of settlements, or a Palestinian state in return?' he wrote.

Family confirms hostage Alon Ohel is alive but injured in Hamas c...	After 492 days, freed hostages confirm Ohel alive and held in inhumane conditions in Hamas tunnels; gifted musician, abducted from Nova festival, not set for release in first phase of hostage deal After 492 days in captivity, the family of Israeli hostage Alon Ohel received on Sunday confirmation that he is alive. The family was informed that Ohel, who was abducted from what has been called the 'shelter of death' at the Nova music festival massacre, is being held in Gaza. However, they also learned that he has an eye injury and is not receiving medical treatment. The confirmation came from recently released hostages who had been held with Ohel in Hamas' underground tunnel network since the day of his abduction. Ohel, who will turn 24 on Monday, is a gifted pianist and musician from Lavon, a community in northern Israel. He began playing at the age of nine and had planned to continue his musical studies at the Rimon School of Music, focusing on jazz. He had also intended to move to Tel Aviv to pursue his musical dreams. Those plans were shattered on October 7, 2023, when Hamas terrorists stormed the Nova festival in Kibbutz Re’im, killing hundreds and abducting scores of revelers. Ohel was among those taken to Gaza. Another hostage abducted from the same bunker, Elia Cohen, is reportedly among those set to be released in the first phase of the current hostage deal. In June 2024, video footage surfaced showing Ohel being taken hostage along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was later killed in captivity, Or Levy, who was freed on Saturday, and Cohen. Ohel’s family said he is being held in harsh conditions underground, without daylight or access to basic human necessities, and that he remains injured. His mother, Idit, told Ynet that the news was both overwhelming and emotional. 'The feelings are very complex and difficult. It’s very unsettling, but at the same time, we are also deeply moved to know that Alon is alive,' she said. 'It’s very distressing to hear about his condition from those who were recently released. He has been in the tunnels this entire time, suffering from severe captivity conditions, including poor nutrition. He has an eye injury we were not aware of.' Ohel’s family expressed outrage over his continued captivity and the suffering he and other hostages endure. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We are devastated and horrified by his dire physical and mental state and the abuse he and the other hostages are still enduring,' the family said in a statement. 'Alon has survived hell until now, but time is running out. The release of the hostages cannot be delayed. Every single one of them must be considered a humanitarian case.' His mother added, 'We must do everything—right now—to bring them home. All of them need to be released urgently. The condition of the men in captivity is deteriorating. We do not accept the selection process that was imposed. It must be corrected. There must be a meaningful push to release them week after week without pause.' The family has not yet spoken with Or Levy, who was abducted alongside Ohel. 'I would like to meet him, and I am waiting for any additional information,' Idit said. 'When Or is ready. He needs to be with his family now. He just found out that his wife was murdered. I want him to heal, and when the time comes for him to speak about Alon, we will be grateful to hear from him and visit him.' On Monday, Ohel will mark his 24th birthday in captivity. His family is organizing an event at Hostage Square in Tel Aviv at 7 p.m. to honor him. 'I have only one wish for Alon’s birthday—that he comes home now,' his mother said. 'Hold on, I know you are strong. Think of us, think of all the things you still want to accomplish. Think about music, about the things you love. Strength doesn’t only come from food—it comes from thoughts, from dreams, even from water… even from air, if he has it. Hold on—this will be over soon. We love him. An entire nation stands behind him, thinking of him and praying for him. He is strong, and he will get through this. Our family has endured hardships before, including hunger during the Holocaust. They survived. And Alon will survive. It is in his blood. He is strong—I know he is strong. He is amazing. When he returns, he will have so much to tell us, and an entire life to live with pride and to fulfill many dreams.' Through tears, she said she imagines the moment she will embrace her son again. 'I imagine his hands—his delicate pianist’s hands. Just to hold them, to see that they are okay, that he is okay,' she said. She urged the public to attend the gathering at Hostage Square. 'As many people as possible should come. Pray for him. I will lead a meditation for prayer, to strengthen and help bring about the release of the hostages. The more people come, the stronger it will be,' she said. Ohel’s family also issued a direct plea to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Security Cabinet, and the government to push forward with the second phase of hostage releases. 'It is your moral duty to do everything possible to save Alon and all the hostages,' the family said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ska9sdltjl	2025-02-09T08:40:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/29/BJJmGOsGp/BJJmGOsGp_2_356_1599_901_0_small.jpg

Outrageous and preposterous': Herzog slams BBC for equating Hama...	President rejects interviewer’s claim of abuse against Palestinian prisoners, calling on network to change its approach and stressing October 7 constituted 'attack on the free world' President Isaac Herzog criticized the BBC on Sunday for equating Palestinian prisoners with Israeli hostages taken by Hamas, calling the comparison 'outrageous and preposterous.' Speaking on BBC’s Sunday Morning News, Herzog rejected interviewer Laura Kuenssberg’s claim that Palestinian prisoners face abuse and harsh conditions in Israeli jails, stressing that Israel abides by the rule of law and judicial oversight. Herzog emphasized that some Palestinian inmates even preferred to stay in Israeli prisons rather than return to Gaza. He urged the BBC to change its approach, calling the October 7 Hamas attack 'an attack on the entire free world' and defending Israel’s efforts to prevent further terrorism. 'What we are doing when we are catching terrorists who carried out these atrocities, we are simply preventing them from taking on further attacks against humanity,' Herzog also said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The president also described the dire conditions faced by the hostages, referencing the release of Eli Sharabi, Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy, who returned emaciated and injured on Saturday after 491 days in captivity. 'They were held in tunnels throughout the entire period,' Herzog said. 'They had no contact with the outside world. They hardly ate. They returned completely emaciated, and they suffered from a huge amount of bruises, pain and wounds, and of course, we haven't even talked about their mental state yet. The level of suffering they endured is shocking, and we remain extremely concerned about the fate of the 76 hostages still in Gaza.' The BBC has faced ongoing criticism for its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. A recent Telegraph report accused the network of over 1,500 violations of its own editorial guidelines and a pattern of bias against Israel in its reporting. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rythob8yke	2025-02-09T07:42:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/09/Hk7Uq48t1l/Hk7Uq48t1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Israeli airstrike targets Syrian military air base, report says	IDF reportedly carries out airstrike on Khalkhalah military airport in Syria’s Sweida province, day after Israeli Air Force jets targeted Hamas weapons depot in Damasucs countryside Israeli forces carried out an airstrike Sunday afternoon on the Khalkhalah Air Base in southern Syria’s Sweida province, according to Syrian media. The strike came just a day after the IDF struck a Hamas weapons depot in the country. Local reports said explosions were heard at the airport, accompanied by the sound of fighter jets. The pro-Iranian Iraqi news agency Sabereen News also reported blasts at the site, attributing the attack to Israel. On Saturday, the IDF confirmed it had struck a Hamas weapons warehouse in Syria, claiming that the arms stored there were intended 'for use in terrorist operations against Israeli forces.' According to the military, the attack took place in the Deir Ali area of southern Syria, guided by intelligence from the IDF’s Northern Command.

Enforcing buffer zone, IDF opens fire on Gazans near border, kill...	After IDF withdrawal from Netzarim Corridor, footage shows dozens of Gazans in buffer zone near Nahal Oz, hundreds of meters from border; Gaza border residents warn lack 'real security' and demand tougher measures Hours after the IDF withdrew from the Netzarim Corridor in Gaza, several dozen Palestinian residents were seen advancing hundreds of meters from the border fence near Nahal Oz on Sunday morning. The IDF, tasked with maintaining a 700-meter-wide security buffer along the border as part of the cease-fire and hostage release agreement, responded with drone strikes and gunfire, killing three people and wounding at least six others. According to reports from Gaza, the casualties were taken to Al-Ma’amdani Hospital in Gaza City. The IDF reported that the individuals were unarmed and had entered the Netzarim Corridor, but moved away after the gunfire. The Otef Israel Forum, representing hundreds of residents in Israeli communities near Gaza, expressed outrage and concern, demanding stricter enforcement of security measures. 'Is this what real security looks like? We warned about this two weeks ago,' the group said in a statement, referencing a letter sent to Defense Minister Israel Katz. The forum criticized what it described as weak open-fire policies and called for a more aggressive approach, urging the government to declare the buffer zone a 'dead zone' with a zero-tolerance policy toward any infiltration. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF responded by reaffirming its commitment to securing Israeli communities. 'IDF soldiers operating in northern Gaza identified suspicious figures moving near them and fired toward them. Several hits were confirmed, and the individuals fled. The IDF remains determined to protect Israeli residents and will continue to act against any violations while adhering to the cease-fire agreement,' the military said in a statement, urging Gaza residents to stay away from Israeli forces. The IDF’s withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor, mandated by the cease-fire agreement, was completed overnight Saturday. The evacuated positions were located east of Salah al-Din Road, a major north-south route through Gaza. With this withdrawal, Israeli forces are no longer stationed in northern Gaza, except for 162nd Division units deployed within the buffer zone near the border. Israeli forces remain stationed along the Philadelphi Corridor in southern Gaza. The withdrawal process began last month, initially allowing over half a million displaced Palestinians to move northward from southern Gaza. Images of this movement circulated widely, with Hamas operatives, some armed, reportedly directing civilians back toward Gaza City. In parallel with the IDF's withdrawal, an American security company was deployed to conduct inspections of people and vehicles entering the area. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjt11unufkx	2025-02-09T07:24:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/09/HksL178KJe/HksL178KJe_1_125_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

IDF expands Iron Wall op in West Bank, targets Nur al-Shams terro...	IDF expands its operation in the northern section of the West Bank, targeting Nur al-Shams refugee camp, a hub for terror activity; Troops dismantle explosives and arrest terrorists as defense minister vows to eliminate terror infrastructure and prevent its resurgence Hundreds of terrorists, some with blood on their hands, have been released so far as part of the cease-fire hostage return deal with Hamas, many of whom have returned to the West Bank. In response, the IDF is expanding its operations in the region. On the 20th day of Operation Iron Wall, the IDF spokesperson announced on Sunday morning that IDF troops, alongside Border Police and Shin Bet forces, began operating overnight in Nur al-Shams, a so-called refugee camp near Tulkarm that has become a stronghold for terror activity. During the opening strike of the operation, troops fired at several armed terrorists. According to security sources, hits were confirmed, with several terrorists killed and others arrested. Palestinians claimed that a 23-year-old woman, who was in an advanced stage of pregnancy, was killed, and her husband critically injured by IDF gunfire after the troops entered the camp. Under the command of Ephraim Brigade Commander Col. Netanel Shamaka, troops are stationed in various parts of the camp, working to clear paths and dismantle explosive devices planted underground – a known tactic used by the terrorists. Progress within the camp is very slow due to the dense population and crowded conditions. Defense Minister Israel Katz stated this morning that 'IDF troops are expanding the operation in the northern section of the West Bank to include the Nur al-Shams refugee camp. We are dismantling the terror infrastructure in the camps and preventing its resurgence. We will not allow the Iranian axis of evil to establish an eastern terror front that threatens the communities of the West Bank, the Seam Zone, and major population centers in Israel.' This marks the fourth target in the expansion of Operation Iron Wall, following operations in Jenin, Tulkarm, and the villages of Tamun and Tubas in the northern Jordan Valley. Nur al-Shams is considered one of the refugee camps where local terror infrastructure has grown significantly. The phenomenon of armed brigades, which began with the Lion’s Den group in Nablus that was dismantled and moved to Jenin, has advanced further in Nur al-Shams. This includes an organization of dozens of terrorists responsible for numerous shooting attacks on IDF troops and residents of communities along the Seam Zone between Israeli territory and the West Bank. Currently, Central Command forces are deployed in three brigade combat teams with special units: in Jenin the Menashe Brigade team is operating; in Tulkarm and Nur al-Shams, the Ephraim Brigade team is active; and in the villages of Tamun, Tayasir, Tubas, and Fara’a, the combat team from the Basic Training Base for Field Units is working. Altogether, hundreds of soldiers are deployed in the northern section of the West Bank with special units, focusing on seizing command centers, operations rooms and explosives labs in the heart of the camps, as well as pursuing terrorists who flee the camps. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Shin Bet is operating alongside IDF troops in the operation, directing forces to arrest and neutralize targets, while also working to thwart terror attacks in the West Bank and within Israel. Since the beginning of the year, the Shin Bet has engaged in intensive activity, successfully preventing about 150 major attacks, including 45 bombing attempts that were thwarted through arrests of terrorists and terror cells in the West Bank that were manufacturing explosives and planning attacks. During the operation, Shin Bet and Border Police have foiled no fewer than eight significant attacks, some through airstrikes and others through arrests or the elimination of terrorists. Some countermeasures involved closing intelligence loops, such as the elimination of two terrorists responsible for the shooting attack in the Palestinian village of Funduq, which killed Police Officer Elad Winkelstein, 35; Rachel Cohen, 70; and Aliza Reiss, 73. Additionally, two terrorists involved in the bombing in the village of Tamun, which killed Staff Sergeant (Res.) Eviatar Ben Yehuda, were eliminated. According to security sources, the IDF is expected to remain in the northern section of the West Bank for an extended period, possibly staying through the Ramadan period, which begins at the end of the month. One reason for remaining in the area is to neutralize the terror brigades, but also to prevent celebrations and armed parades in honor of terrorists released weekly to the West Bank in exchange for hostages. Moreover, the Shin Bet and IDF are monitoring those released prisoners. Just last week, a senior security official stated that, based on intelligence data, most released terrorists return to engaging in various forms of terror activity. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkjamwukyl	2025-02-09T04:39:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/09/S1eJHSbUt1e/S1eJHSbUt1e_483_617_2238_1260_0_small.jpg

Zangauker and Cohen families ask for court to issue injunction compelling government to implement the deal to the end after it was approved by the cabinet, saying lives of hostages are at stake The families of Matan Zangauker and Nimrod Cohen, both held hostage in Gaza, on Sunday filed an urgent motion to the Supreme Court demanding that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the government reveal the terms of the Gaza cease-fire agreement signed on January 15. The families and especially those of hostages that were not included in the first phase of the deal 'have a right to know the details of the agreement who directly effect their loved ones,' the motion read. Einav Zangauker, Matan's mother and Vicky and Yehuda Cohen, Nimrod's parents along with his siblings, claimed that the government must implement the phases of the cease-fire deal without delay after they were approved by the cabinet. 'The time passing, endangers the lives of the hostages,' they wrote, naming at least 26 hostages murdered in captivity. The families also seek an injunction that would compel the government to divulge the instructions given to the negotiating team meeting with the mediators, out of concern that there would be an attempt to foil the completion of the deal.

Thai nationals held captive by Hamas for 15 months return home	Five Thai nationals held captive by Hamas for over a year returned to Thailand on Sunday, reuniting with their tearful families at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport. The returnees, dressed in winter jackets, were met with emotional embraces from their families. According to Israeli authorities, Hamas terrorists abducted at least 240 people, including Israelis and foreign nationals, in an October 2023 attack on the Israeli border. During the attack, Hamas gunmen killed 41 Thais and kidnapped 30 Thai laborers. Later that year, the first group of Thai hostages was returned. Before the conflict, approximately 30,000 Thai laborers worked in Israel's agriculture sector, making them one of the largest migrant worker groups in the country. Nearly 9,000 Thais were repatriated following the attack. Thailand's foreign ministry said a Thai national is still believed to be held captive by Hamas, as well as two bodies of killed Thais.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkpyvmuykx	2025-02-09T04:05:15-08:00

Ella Ben Ami shared moments from the first day with her father, who returned after 70 weeks in captivity in Gaza, on Instagram; 'A night in the hospital for the best reasons' she wrote. Ella Ben Ami, the daughter of Ohad, who returned to Israel on Saturday as part of the fifth hostage return of the current deal, shared her fight for her father's return throughout the process. Now she's also making sure to document every moment after his return and isn't hiding her excitement at Ichilov Medical Center in Tel Aviv. Following the footage of the meeting between Ohad and his three daughters after his 70 weeks in captivity, Ella shared the first hours together at night in the special room prepared for him in the hospital. 'A night in the hospital for the best reasons possible,' she shared. 'Dad came back to us, smiles, laughs at us and hugs us for a long time. Hearing his voice again is an exciting that I have no way of explaining.' However, she also shared her concerns for the 76 hostages still in captivity and wrote that 'along with all the happiness, the images of him getting out of the Hamas car will never be erased from my mind. After everything that happened this day, the only thing that goes through my mind is how we must get everyone out of there, get everyone out of this hell, and quickly.' Hours later, she shared that they were eating breakfast together for the first time in 492 days. 'It wasn't a dream, Dad is here eating breakfast and I'm sitting next to him and I can't take my eyes off him. I'm afraid he'll disappear if I close them for a moment,' she wrote. Ayelet Hakim, Ohad's sister-in-law, shared in an interview with Ynet that even now 'the roller coaster never stops for a moment. Even when we saw him leave, the pictures were horrific, but Ohadi is back and we can see him up close, which is very moving. Ohad always used his sense of humor in both happy and sad situations. I was happy to see that he kept it and used it a few hours after he left the horrors of Gaza.' She noted that she had yet to see him in person, but that she had spoken to her relatives who did. 'He is mentally and emotionally strong and you can see it in him. We are a big family and I am waiting in line to see him; hopefully it will happen tonight or tomorrow morning,' she said. When asked what the first thing he ate was, she shared that first of all she was encouraged by the fact that he was eating: 'They tell me that he is eating, for Ohad, food takes up a big part of life. He eats and undergoes tests. He is thin, but he is the same Ohad. He ate burekas and treats. That's what he wanted. It sounds like a return to life.' Ayelet also addressed his request to know what happened since he was kidnapped - and in particular about October 7. 'I think he knows more than we think,' she said. 'He has a lot of gaps to fill - and a lot of tragedies to hear. He has no home to return to in Be'eri. He has the mental capacity to deal with the news he will receive. The fact that Natalie enlisted in the army and Ohad wrapped himself in the Israeli flag means that it is a good sign for the State of Israel that we continue like this. He said that he knows that there are a lot of difficult things that he needs to hear.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Keren Ben Ami, Ohad's sister-in-law, added that he is 'fine and in good spirits.' According to her, 'He hasn't lost his sense of humor, his sharpness and his practical thinking. You can see that he is slowly returning to himself. He came back very weak and lost a lot of weight, but apart from the physical weakness - in terms of the mind he is strong. We are all surrounding us and he will be completely fine.' She said that he doesn't share too much about his period in captivity, but he told them that every day he thought about everyone and prayed for everyone's health. 'We were shocked,' she shared. 'He did kiddush and havdalah there, and prayed for everyone. He grew very strong in captivity.

Qatar condemned on Sunday a comment from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggesting establishing a Palestinian state inside Saudi territory, the Qatari foreign ministry said in statement. Qatar, a key mediator in Gaza ceasefire negotiations between Hamas and Israel, described Netanyahu's statement as 'provocative.' Netanyahu appeared to be joking on Thursday when he responded to an interviewer on pro-Netanyahu Channel 14 who mistakenly said 'Saudi state' instead of 'Palestinian state', before correcting himself.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ske115zlkyg	2025-02-09T03:05:58-08:00

If US makes nuclear deal with Iran, Israel will not bomb it, Trum...	After discussing the issue with Netanyahu, the American president told the New York Post he would like to make a deal with Iran on the nuclear issue, thus saving it from an Israeli airstrike; 'They don't want to die' U.S. President Donald Trump reiterates his messages to Iran regarding its nuclear program. 'I would like a deal done with Iran on non-nuclear. I would prefer that to bombing the hell out of it,' he tells the New York Post. 'They don’t want to die. Nobody wants to die.' He emphasized Israel would not strike Iran if a nuclear deal is completed. About two weeks ago, Trump said it would 'be nice' if the Iranian issue was to be solved without Israel attacking military facilities on its territory. The American president did not rule out the possibility of an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities at the time, but repeatedly signaled that he intended to promote a new agreement on the issue. Trump later said that he intended to speak with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. Shortly before meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Tuesday, the American president signed a renewal of the 'maximum pressure' policy, which is intended to impose heavy sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Trump said that Iran is too close to a nuclear weapon, and warned that if Tehran decided to assassinate him in response, Iran would be 'obliterated.' He said that he left 'instructions' to do so in the event that Tehran did assassinate him. Later, in a meeting with Netanyahu in front of the cameras, the American president claimed that Iran is not weak, but strong. He added that Iran was in big trouble when he left office, having no money to pay Hamas and Hezbollah. 'They sold huge amounts of oil to China. They became rich very quickly,' Trump explained. He also claims that October 7 would not have happened under his leadership as well as the Russia-Ukraine war. After the meeting, at a joint press conference with Netanyahu in which he announced his proposal to take over the Gaza Strip and displace its residents, Trump said: 'During my term, I have brought peace and stability to the Middle East that they have not seen in decades. We withdrew from the nuclear agreement and imposed very harsh sanctions on the Iranian regime. We stopped Iran's proxies and deprived them of resources.' The American president added that he hopes that Iran will be a peaceful country. 'I want Iran to be peaceful and successful. I hated doing it. I did it once before. And we brought them down to a level where they were unable to give any money. They had to survive themselves. And they had no money. They were essentially broke,' he said.

I’m not putting restrictions. I’m not. They cannot have one thing. They cannot have a nuclear weapon. And if I think that they will have a nuclear weapon, despite what I just said, I think that’s going to be very unfortunate for them,' he said. The Iranian Foreign Ministry said on Friday, referring to the pressure on Iran through the imposition of sanctions: 'This is an illegitimate and illegal action. As far as Iran is concerned, the United States is responsible for the consequences of such unilateral and bullying actions.' Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, even responded to Trump with a strong message. 'If they threaten our security, we threaten theirs. If they harm the security of the Iranian people, we will undoubtedly harm their security,' Khamenei said in a speech in Tehran on Friday. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryn500liyje	2025-02-09T02:20:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/ryeWfliLJe/ryeWfliLJe_0_0_853_488_0_small.jpg

IDF burns equipment, leaves Netzarim Corridor: 'Hamas is regroupi...	In line with the hostage deal, the IDF began withdrawing from the Netzarim Corridor, its last northern Gaza foothold; Hamas called the move a 'victory' while IDF troops pledged to return, burning outpost equipment to prevent its use by Hamas In accordance with the framework of the hostage deal and directives from the political leadership, the IDF began a gradual withdrawal on Saturday night from the last outposts along the Netzarim Corridor, which cuts the Gaza Strip in half. A video circulated on social media showed an officer addressing his troops over the radio, stating that this is only a temporary retreat: 'We will return here, don’t worry. Hamas is regrouping, and so are we.' 'We will bring back all the hostages, the Trump Plan will be implemented, and we will return to settle all the communities here,' the officer added. At the same time, footage emerged showing IDF troops burning the contents of the last evacuated outposts to prevent the equipment from falling into the hands of Hamas. The IDF has not yet responded to the footage being circulated. The head of Hamas’ governmental media office told the Qatari channel Al-Araby that the IDF’s withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor 'will restore movement between the districts of the Gaza Strip.' He added that 'the withdrawal is one of the most important achievements of our people. International organizations have begun gradually returning to northern Gaza. We have renovated the UNRWA headquarters in the north to resume aid work there, and we expect the agency’s workers to return now.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri described the withdrawal from Netzarim as 'humiliating' and claimed it represents 'a declaration of Netanyahu’s defeat and failure to achieve his goals or maintain his hold on Gaza’s territory.' He added that 'in 2005, (then-Prime Minister Ariel )Sharon withdrew from Gaza even though he used to say, ‘Netzarim is like Tel Aviv.’ These invasions have repeated themselves, but the result is the same – Gaza remains resilient against invaders.' Netzarim Corridor, controlled by the 36th Division, served as the last barrier between the southern and northern parts of the Gaza Strip. After the full withdrawal, no IDF troops will remain in the northern Gaza Strip, except for the 162nd Division, which is deployed in the buffer zone area. Around two weeks ago, the process of evacuating the Netzarim Corridor began, with IDF troops initially withdrawing from the western side of the corridor. This allowed more than half a million Palestinians to return from the southern Gaza Strip to Gaza City in the north. Alongside the withdrawal, an American security company was deployed to the area to conduct inspections of those arriving by vehicle or on foot. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy0093gutkg	2025-02-09T01:47:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/09/r1c6jaHtkg/r1c6jaHtkg_0_206_288_163_0_small.jpg
Outrage grows over cabinet inaction on locking down next phase of...	The Israeli government delays crucial Security Cabinet discussions on Phase B of the cease-fire and hostage return deal despite growing public outrage; Families demand urgent action after released hostages appeared gaunt and frail, highlighting the dire conditions of the 76 remaining captives The Security Cabinet meeting on Phase B of the hostage deal has yet to be scheduled, despite a promise made Saturday night by a 'political source' to convene it after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's return to Israel from Washington. On Sunday morning, as Netanyahu boarded the official state Wing of Zion plane, it was revealed that the Cabinet ministers would meet only on Tuesday, or possibly even Thursday. On Sunday evening, upon Netanyahu’s return to Israel, a government meeting will take place, but it will focus on 'how to investigate the events of October 7,' following a deadline set by the High Court of Justice for the government to hold a discussion on this topic. Last night, after the briefing by the political source, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum expressed outrage and demanded the Cabinet convene immediately in light of the horrifying images of Ohad Ben Ami, Or Levy, and Eli Sharabi upon their release on Saturday morning during the fifth hostage release of the deal. The three hostages were released from Hamas captivity appearing gaunt, emaciated and pale. 'How, after the horrifying images of Eli, Ohad and Or this morning, is the Cabinet not convening immediately?' the Forum asked in a statement. 'What more proof is needed for decision-makers to understand the critical urgency of bringing back the remaining 76 hostages?' Meanwhile, an Israeli delegation departed for Doha, this time joined by Hostage and Missing Persons Coordinator Gal Hirsch and a senior Shin Bet official. However, the Forum expressed dissatisfaction, noting that this delegation is not authorized to discuss Phase II of the deal, but only to continue Phase I, which is still ongoing. The Forum called on Netanyahu to 'send a negotiation delegation to Qatar with a clear and full mandate to finalize the agreement urgently, ensuring the return of the last hostage, with a clear timeline and terms.' Fifth round of hostage releases According to the agreement, discussions on Phase II of the deal were supposed to begin on the 16th day of the agreement, which was a week ago. Netanyahu, who has so far refrained from sending a delegation to discuss the continuation of the deal, considered the meetings he held during his visit to the U.S. with Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Middle East envoy, on the 16th day, as the initiation of the discussions stipulated in the agreement. After the fifth round of releases, 76 hostages remain in captivity. Of the 33 hostages slated for release in Phase I, 16 have been released so far, alongside five Thai citizens who were freed outside the framework of the agreement. Three more rounds of releases remain in Phase I. Of the 17 hostages expected to be released in these rounds, eight are no longer alive. The next two phases will see the release of three hostages each, and in the final week, 11 additional hostages will be freed, including, as per the agreement, Hisham al-Sayed and Avera Mengistu, who have been held in captivity for over a decade. Among the hostages yet to be released in Phase I are Shiri Bibas and her children, Ariel and Kfir, whose fate is of grave concern to the IDF. Additionally, five men categorized as elderly are expected to be released: Itzik Algert, Shlomo Mansour, Ohad Yahalomi, Oded Lifshitz, and Tsahi Idan. Nine hostages classified as ill or injured are also expected to be released: Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn, Omer Wenkert, Alexander Trupanov, Elia Cohen, Tal Shem, Omer Shem Tov, as well as Mengistu and al-Sayed. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Alongside the deep shock felt by the public, politicians also expressed anger on Saturday night over Hamas' gruesome display and the condition of the hostages upon their release. Netanyahu, still in Washington at the time, issued his first statement – half a day after the horrifying images were revealed: 'Once again, we have seen the monstrosity of Hamas. These are the same monsters who massacred our citizens and tortured our captives. And I say to them again: Their blood is on their hands. We will do everything to bring back all our hostages. We will ensure their security. This is the directive I have given to the delegation – to convey this message to the mediators and demand it.' However, senior Israeli officials said on Saturday that the country’s leadership was not truly surprised by the horrifying images of the hostages, which reminded many of Holocaust survivors. 'The shocking impact of the images is on the public,' the officials said. 'The political echelon was fully aware of the hostages’ condition, including those released today. Those familiar with the facts were not surprised at all,' they added. Following the officials’ statements and the apparent 'shock' of politicians, hostage families themselves testified that they had been informed of the dire conditions in which their loved ones were being held. Tal Levy, Or Levy’s brother, said in an interview on Sunday morning with Reshet Bet radio that official sources had told him and his family months ago, before Yahya Sinwar was targeted, that men were being starved under his orders. 'I don’t think he [Or] would have survived another month,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyxidj8tjg	2025-02-09T00:42:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/rJMIVi4tyx/rJMIVi4tyx_0_75_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Despite US, Hezbollah joins new Lebanon government	Tasked with rebuilding the war-torn nation, tackling economic crises, and restoring stability, the 24-member cabinet must secure parliamentary approval to address Lebanon’s pressing challenges Lebanon’s presidential office announced the formation of a new government led by Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salamon Saturday, consisting of 24 ministers, including from Hezbollah, despite the 'red line' drawn by the U.S. that insisted that the Iran backed group not be included. The Lebanese network LBCI reported that Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri from the Shi'ite Amal Party which is an ally of Hezbollah, had met with Morgan Ortagus, the U.S. Deputy Envoy to the Middle East, over the weekend and assured her that the government would be formed 'today or tomorrow.' During her visit to Lebanon, Ortagus emphasized that the United States opposes Hezbollah's involvement in the new government. 'Israel has succeeded in defeating Hezbollah, and we commend it for this. The United States is committed to a partnership and friendship with Lebanon’s new government, and we are all dedicated to curbing Hezbollah’s influence,' Ortagus said. 'Hezbollah cannot be part of the Lebanese government. Their era is over. We are holding discussions with Lebanon and Israel regarding the redeployment of Lebanese forces in the south and remain committed to the February 18 deadline. We are not afraid of Hezbollah because they have been militarily defeated.' The announcement of the government’s formation follows weeks of consultations. As recently as last Thursday, reports indicated that the formation had 'failed at the last minute,' with the final hurdles stemming from the need to appoint the fifth Shia minister. The Shia duo (the Amal Movement, led by Speaker Berri, and Hezbollah) secured five portfolios in the new government. The government also includes five female ministers overseeing the education, welfare, tourism, youth and sports, and environmental portfolios. President Joseph Aoun expressed satisfaction with the formation of the new government, saying that its members are 'non-partisan and will serve all Lebanese citizens, as their goal is Lebanon’s national interest.' 'Reform is the only way to save the country. Rebuilding the south is not a promise; it is a commitment. We will continue with economic reforms and establish an independent judiciary. The government will be dedicated to constructive work, not conflict,' Prime Minister Salam said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The new government must now draft a policy statement outlining its approach and priorities, which will require a vote of confidence from parliament to fully assume its powers. The first meeting of the new ministers is scheduled for this coming Tuesday at 11 a.m. The government faces numerous challenges, including rebuilding Lebanon in the aftermath of the war, addressing the severe economic crisis, and advancing the state, which has operated without a president for the past two years. The U.S. Embassy in Lebanon welcomed the formation of the new government. 'The Lebanese people deserve a government that will rebuild state institutions, fight corruption, and implement necessary reforms,' the embassy said in a post on X. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry also issued a statement congratulating Lebanon on forming its new government: 'The establishment of the new government in Lebanon is an important step toward a new phase of fulfilling the aspirations of the Lebanese people and preserving Lebanon’s sovereignty, unity, security, and stability. Egypt will continue to provide all forms of support to Lebanon.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b100yw0hkke	2025-02-09T00:36:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/07/BJ31WYXKkl/BJ31WYXKkl_0_87_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Or Levy learns of wife's murder upon release from captivity	After being held hostage for 491 days, Levy reunites with young son but confronted with the devastating truths that Einav, his wife did not survive the massacre at the Nova festival; Also learns fellow captives Hersh, Almog, executed by Hamas in Gaza Or Levy was abducted by terrorists from the 'death shelter,' where he had sought refuge with his wife Einav and many others during the Nova music festival amid the Hamas' carnage on October 7. What was meant to protect their lives turned into a death trap—Einav was murdered in the shelter alongside 15 other victims. On Saturday, Or finally returned home, reuniting with his 3-year-old son, Almog, but also received the devastating news of his wife’s murder. The heroism displayed in that shelter has already been widely recounted. Among those who fought back against the grenades thrown inside by the terrorists was Aner Shapira, a fallen soldier from the Nahal Brigade’s elite unit who had been on leave that day and was attending the Nova festival. With extraordinary courage, Aner stood at the shelter’s entrance, repeatedly catching and throwing back the grenades. The eighth grenade exploded in his hands, killing him. Or’s mother, Geula, shared on Saturday with Army Radio that after his release, Or said he knew Aner’s story and expressed a strong desire to meet his parents. 'He’s a hero, and we all know he’s a hero. Thanks to him, my son is alive,' she said. She added that Or recounted how he himself threw the last grenade tossed by the terrorists before he was abducted. 'He said he didn’t even have a chance to turn around and see his wife.' From that same shelter, Hersh Goldberg-Polin was also abducted, and was murdered in captivity at the end of August. 'Or knows what happened in the shelter; he knows about Polin’s injury. He thought Polin had been released. He asked me if we had heard the name,' Geula said. She also revealed that Or mistakenly believed Almog Sarusi, who was murdered alongside Hersh and four other hostages in a tunnel, had been freed. 'He was convinced that Hersh and Almog had returned,' she said. She noted that Or 'was held in a tunnel without communication and could only guess that his wife Einav had been murdered. On Saturday, he asked, and they told him.' Moshe Shapira, the father of Aner, expressed great joy about the release of the man his son had helped save in the shelter, saying he hopes to meet Or soon. 'Blessed is He who has kept us alive, sustained us, and brought us to this moment. It’s incredibly moving and incredibly joyous. What Aner started has now come full circle. Or was saved and can now embrace his family and his son, and we pray for the release of all the others. There’s nothing greater than this.' Moshe added, 'From the shelter, four people were abducted to Gaza; two of them remain in captivity: Elia Cohen and Alon Ehal. We are praying for their release, and may there be a complete group of survivors thanks to Aner,' referring to the fact that seven people from the shelter survived the attack. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He continued, 'The shelter brought us a heavy blow when Hersh was killed, and we had hoped he would return. He is forever connected to Aner in our hearts. I’m glad we have a little light now. Whenever Or is ready, we’ll be very happy to embrace him and his entire family. We were moved by the return of every hostage, of course, but the hostages from the shelter especially touch our hearts. The state’s mission is to bring all the hostages home as quickly as possible and return to being a unified nation without divisions. This is a matter of saving lives—there is no debate here.' Rachel Goldberg-Polin, Hersh’s mother, whose son was abducted from the same shelter along with Or, said: 'We received the wonderful news that Eli, Or, and Ohad were released today. We feel a deep connection to Or and his family because he and Hersh were abducted together from the same shelter, on the same truck, on October 7. In fact, Or's brother reached out to us immediately after the Sabbath to let us know that one of the first questions Or asked his brother that morning was how Hersh was doing. He assumed Hersh had been released long ago, and his brother had to explain to him that Hersh was murdered five months ago.' Hersh’s father, John, added: 'Seeing the condition of the three hostages, hearing that Or had no idea what happened to Hersh, that Eli wasn’t aware of the fate of his wife and daughters—it’s just a gut punch for all of us, and it reminds us that we need to do more. I’m speaking directly to President Trump and Steve Witkoff—you’ve shown that you’re the only ones who managed to move this situation forward. Let’s not think in terms of Phase A, Phase B, and Phase C over many months. Let’s think bigger and faster. Release all 76 hostages this week. End the war. Let’s get this done now.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjeu36bkjx	2025-02-08T22:53:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/H1ikQ7SFyg/H1ikQ7SFyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu: Saudi normalization after Iran, Hamas defeated	Prime minister tells Fox when Israel completes transforming the Middle East, it would set the stage for peace through strength; praises Trump Gaza plan, blames Egypt for preventing Palestinians from leaving the Strip Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said normalization with Saudi Arabia would come after Hamas is defeated and the Iranian axis cut. His comments came after Riyadh denied claims made by U.S. President Donald Trump that that there was no Saudi demand for an establishment of a Palestinian state before normalization with Israel could take place. 'When we complete the changeover in the Middle East, when we cut the Iranian axis down even further that we've already cut it, when we make sure Iran doesn't have nuclear weapons, when we destroy Hamas, that will set the stage for an additional agreement with the Saudis and with others,' Netanyahu said. 'I believe also in the Muslim world because it's peace through strength.' Netnayahu said there was no longer any belief that there could be a Palestinian State after the Oct. 7 massacre, 'They had one, it's called Gaza,' he said. 'We got the Abraham Accord because we went around the Palestinians,' he said claiming the Palestinian Authority, like Hamas seeks the destruction of Israel. Israel is small he said, praising Trump for cutting to the chase. 'We can't be any smaller, we're not going to have an organization that is committed to our destruction, nine miles from the sea.' Netanyahu again expressed his enthusiasm for Trump's plan to displace Palestinians from Gaza while the Strip was rebuilt. He said Israel would destroy Hamas, that was its job so no American forces would be needed or tax payer dollars used. I think the proposal is the first fresh idea. 'Gaza is basically a small area 25 miles from Tel Aviv which Hamas has used as a springboard for continuous terrorists attacks against Israel,' he said. 'Then comes president Trump and says hey, let them leave, and I'll find a place for a temporary relocation,' he said. 'Not forceful eviction, not ethnic cleansing, getting people out of what these do-gooders' say is an open-air prison.'

Saudi Arabia rejects Netanyahu's remarks on displacing Palestinia...	Saudi statement mentions Netanyahu's name but does not directly refer to the prime minister's comments about establishing a Palestinian state in Saudi territory Saudi Arabia affirmed its categorical rejection of remarks by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about displacing Palestinians from their land, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday. In an interview on a friendly channel 14 last Thursday, Netanyahu was asked how he would bridge the gap between U.S. President Donald Trump's claim the Saudi Arabi did not demand the establishement of a Palestinian State and Riyadh's denial. The interviewer mistakenly said 'Saudi state' instead of 'Palestinian state.' The prime minister corrected him but added in jest that perhaps Saudi Arabia could allow a Palestinian state in its own vast territory. While the Saudi statement mentioned Netanyahu's name, it did not directly refer to the comments about establishing a Palestinian state in Saudi territory. Egypt and Jordan also condemned the Israeli suggestions, with Cairo deeming the idea as a 'direct infringement of Saudi sovereignty'. The kingdom said it valued 'brotherly' states' rejection of Netanyahu's remarks. 'This occupying extremist mindset does not comprehend what the Palestinian territory means for the brotherly people of Palestine and its conscientious, historical and legal association with that land,' it said. Discussions of the fate of Palestinians in Gaza has been upended by Tuesday's shock proposal from President Donald Trump that the U.S. would 'take over the Gaza Strip' from Israel and create a 'Riviera of the Middle East' after resettling Palestinians elsewhere. Saudi Arabia and the other Arab states have roundly condemned Trump's comments. Trump has said Saudi Arabia was not demanding a Palestinian state as a condition for normalising ties with Israel. But Riyadh rebuffed his statements, saying it would not establish ties with Israel without the creation of a Palestinian state.

However, their release was marred by disturbing images, as the three appeared severely emaciated and weak, forced to participate in a Hamas-led display in central Gaza before being handed over to the Red Cross. While their reunions with families in Israel were emotional, they were also accompanied by heartbreaking revelations. Eli Sharabi was informed that his wife Lianne and daughters Noiya and Yahel were murdered in the October 7 attack, along with his brother Yossi, who was also taken hostage but later killed in captivity. Or Levy, who reunited with his three-year-old son Almog, learned that his wife Einav was also murdered that day. Remaining hostages and next phases of the deal With the completion of this round, 76 hostages remain in Gaza. Under Phase I of the agreement, a total of 33 hostages were set to be released, of whom 16 have now returned, alongside five Thai nationals freed separately. The final three rounds of releases in Phase I are expected to free 17 more hostages, including eight who are deceased. The next two rounds will see three hostages freed in each, followed by a final release of 11 hostages, including Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who have been held by Hamas for a decade. Among those still unaccounted for are Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, with growing concerns over their fate. Other hostages expected to be released include five older male captives and nine who are sick or wounded. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dispatched an Israeli delegation to Qatar on Saturday night to continue negotiations on Phase I, but without authorization to discuss Phase II, which would involve the release of all remaining living hostages. Hamas has demanded an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza as part of that phase. Although formal talks on Phase II were originally expected to begin Monday, discussions have so far been limited to behind-the-scenes contacts, with U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff playing a key role. The Israeli delegation to Doha is officially tasked with handling technical aspects of Phase I, amid Israeli accusations that Hamas has already violated parts of the agreement. Netanyahu upgraded the delegation’s status, adding Hostage and Missing Persons Coordinator Gal Hirsch to the team. However, sources familiar with the negotiations questioned the move, noting that Hirsch had not been directly involved in talks until now and was primarily responsible for liaison with hostage families. The delegation also includes a former deputy head of Israel’s Shin Bet security agency, though it remains focused on technical negotiations rather than broader hostage-release terms. Delegation to Qatar with no mandate The delegation was dispatched to Doha to continue negotiations on the remaining hostage releases under Phase I of the cease-fire agreement with Hamas. However, diplomatic sources indicate the mission is largely symbolic, as formal talks on Phase II—intended to secure the release of all remaining hostages—were supposed to begin last Monday. Witkoff urged Netanyahu to send negotiators to advance discussions on the next stage of the deal. From the perspective of the U.S. and mediating nations, this marks the beginning of Phase II. However, Israeli officials insist that talks on Phase II will not take place until after a Security Cabinet meeting, which is yet to be scheduled. It remains unclear whether the Cabinet will convene on Monday or Tuesday, but until then, Israeli negotiators will limit discussions to Phase I. 'With the completion of the latest hostage release, Prime Minister Netanyahu has instructed the delegation to focus on technical aspects of the agreement,' a senior Israeli official. 'Upon his return to Israel, he will convene the security cabinet to determine Israel’s stance on Phase II.' The delegation arrives in Doha amid Israeli outrage over Hamas' treatment of the three freed hostages, who appeared severely emaciated and were forced to participate in a Hamas-led public display before their release. Netanyahu, who remains in Washington, condemned the hostage release as a 'horrific spectacle,' vowing to eliminate Hamas while ensuring the safe return of all hostages. 'We will do everything to bring our hostages home, but Hamas will not be there,' Netanyahu said. 'Trump fully agrees with me on this. We will destroy Hamas and bring our people back.' He added: 'Sara and I embrace Ohad, Eli and Or, along with their families. We have once again witnessed the barbarity of Hamas—the same monsters who massacred our people and tormented our hostages. Their blood is on their own hands. Our delegation has clear instructions to convey this to mediators and demand action.' While the public was deeply shaken by images of the hostages—reminiscent of Holocaust survivors—senior Israeli officials said the government was fully aware of their deteriorating state long before their release. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The shocking impact of these images is on the public,' one official said. 'The political leadership was well-informed about the hostages' condition, including those released today. Anyone familiar with the facts was not surprised.' Israel faces limited options in responding to Hamas' violations of the cease-fire agreement, as any action could be interpreted as a breach of the deal. While Israel is unlikely to derail the agreement before all 33 hostages under Phase I are freed, officials are considering interim measures, such as: Delaying humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza, though this could be seen as a clear violation of the agreement. Reducing the number of wounded Gazans allowed to exit via the Rafah crossing for medical treatment. Delaying IDF withdrawals within Gaza, including the planned overnight retreat from Netzarim Corridor, a key corridor established by Israeli forces during the ground operation. Clock is ticking Israel's anger over Hamas' treatment of freed hostages has so far remained within the framework of ongoing negotiations on Phase I of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. However, officials suggest that the shocking images of emaciated hostages may strengthen Israel’s demands for Phase II, making an agreement even less likely. Israeli officials are expected to insist on strict conditions for a second-phase deal, including the exile of Hamas leaders, the dismantling of its military wing, the disarmament of Gaza and the release of all remaining hostages. However, there is little chance Hamas will accept these terms, raising doubts about whether Phase II will ever materialize. While a full-fledged agreement seems unlikely, some officials do not rule out an extension of Phase I, which could involve the incremental release of additional hostages and a prolonged cease-fire. Israel is also expected to complete its withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor—the buffer zone along Gaza’s border with Egypt—by the 50th day of the cease-fire. However, following global outrage over Hamas' treatment of the hostages, there is widespread skepticism that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would authorize such a withdrawal. Faced with the dilemma of resuming military operations or proceeding with hostage negotiations, momentum appears to be shifting toward renewed fighting. This sentiment is echoed by Netanyahu’s inner circle, with his spokesperson, Omer Dostri, posting on social media: 'Reminder: Hamas' neo-Nazi regime will not remain in Gaza. The clock is ticking.' Senior Israeli officials warned late Saturday: 'Phase II of the deal will depend entirely on the conditions Israel sets. If Israel insists on the exile of Hamas leadership and the dismantling of its military wing, there will be no Phase II.' Sources familiar with the discussions do not believe Netanyahu is preparing for Phase II at all, pointing to his recent appointment of Gal Hirsch to the negotiating team—despite his lack of prior involvement in the talks—as evidence that there is no real infrastructure being built for continued negotiations. One senior source described the public outrage over the hostage release images as a serious political blow to Netanyahu, saying: 'Two weeks ago, after the third hostage release, Netanyahu’s approval ratings collapsed in the polls. We all knew the hostages were severely malnourished—doctors warned they could die in captivity. What was the point of this public display? Is there anyone who didn’t know they were starving?' Netanyahu, who remained in Washington while the fifth hostage release took place, is expected to return to Israel overnight Sunday. He has faced sharp criticism for choosing to stay at the luxury Willard Hotel rather than returning before the Sabbath, as some of his advisers—including National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and Hostage Coordinator Gal Hirsch—did. Netanyahu justified his extended stay by citing 'an overwhelming number of meeting requests' from U.S. officials. His office stated that he watched the hostage release footage from what was described as 'the control center of the Israeli delegation in the U.S.' and was 'continuously updated by the hostages and missing persons coordinator, who returned to Israel ahead of him.' What’s next? With diplomatic tensions rising and no clear path forward for Phase II, Israel is likely to increase pressure on Hamas while weighing its military options. The next few days will be critical in determining whether negotiations continue or if hostilities resume in Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skes11vbtkx	2025-02-08T14:33:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/HJlaZrrt1g/HJlaZrrt1g_0_1_850_479_0_small.jpg
Israel strikes near Damascus and southern Syria, reports say	Israel has struck multiple locations across Syria overnight, including the city of Inkhil in Daraa province and the A-Dreij area near Damascus, local media reported late on Saturday According to Al Mayadeen, a Lebanese network affiliated with Hezbollah, explosions were also heard in Daraa, Quneitra and Tartus, suggesting a broader attack. Syrian authorities have not confirmed casualties or the extent of the damage. Israel has not commented on the reports, in line with its policy of not acknowledging specific military operations in Syria. However, Israel has repeatedly targeted Iran-linked military infrastructure and weapons transfers to Hezbollah in the past.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryv9o8htjx	2025-02-08T13:20:18-08:00	
Israeli UN ambassador calls on Guterres to condemn Hamas’ treatme...	Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon called on UN Secretary-General António Guterres on Saturday to unequivocally condemn Hamas’ inhumane treatment of hostages and demand their unconditional release from what he described as 'hell in Gaza.' Following the release of Eli Sharabi, Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy, Danon sent a formal letter to Guterres, arguing that the frail and malnourished condition of the freed hostages is clear evidence of Hamas’ war crimes and blatant violations of international law. 'It is not the people of Gaza or Hamas operatives who are suffering from malnutrition—our hostages are,' Danon wrote, highlighting what he called the cruel and systematic abuse of Israeli captives. Israel has repeatedly urged the international community to put greater pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages, accusing the terror group of using them as bargaining chips while violating their basic human rights. The UN has yet to issue an official response to Danon’s demand.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bygoqbbtjl	2025-02-08T11:50:20-08:00	
Teddy bear helps hostage's British family come to terms with grie...	As Gillian and Pete Brisley watched their son-in-law Eli Sharabi freed from Hamas captivity, Gillian clutched a teddy bear once belonging to their slain daughter Lianne; while relieved, they were shocked by Eli’s frail state, their grief for Lianne and their granddaughters resurfacing As Gillian Brisley and her husband, Pete, watched their son-in-law's release from captivity on Saturday morning, she clutched a teddy bear to her chest. It was a reminder of everything the family has suffered since Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing their daughter, Lianne Sharabi, and teenage granddaughters, Noiya and Yahel, while taking son-in-law Eli Sharabi hostage. Eli's brother Yossi was also killed. The stuffed toy, which once belonged to Lianne, was a tangible link between the Brisleys and events in the Middle East as they watched the hostage handover unfold on TV at their home in South Wales. 'While Gill was crying, she was holding on to the teddy bear, which was Lianne's from the age of about 10 years old and which we were lucky enough to find on Kibbutz Be'eri when we went to the house,' Pete Brisley said. 'When we went to the house, it was filthy, bullet holes everywhere. So we tidied up the house, tidied up the garden, so if Eli wanted to come home to it, then it looks reasonable because it was an absolute shambles.' Even that simple cleanup was an act of faith because the family had received no word on Sharabi at all since the terrorists took him back to Gaza with more than 200 other hostages. Out of nowhere, the Brisleys were told Friday that Sharabi, 52, was to be one of three hostages released the next day. So they got up early Saturday morning to see their son-in-law walk free. The moment was bittersweet. They were thrilled that he was finally free but horrified by the pale, emaciated figure they saw on TV. This wasn't the swarthy, robust man they last saw 18 months ago. The spark that always glinted in his eyes was gone. 'He looks as though he's been to Belsen,' Pete Brisley said, referring to the World War II concentration camp. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sharabi's release also triggered other emotions for family members, who had suppressed their grief by focusing their energies on securing his freedom. When asked how she felt, Gillian Brisley said she was relieved he was free. But there was more to say. 'The emotion of seeing him also then brought the grief of losing our girls right up to our throats,' she said. 'We just sat here and we cried. We cried for our loss. We cried with relief that Eli was on his way home. We cried for Yossi. Just, you know, mixed emotions.' Then there's the continuing concern for Sharabi. Sharabi was told only after his return that his wife and two daughters were killed on Oct. 7. The family had hoped that he was told beforehand so that he wouldn't have to process that grief after surviving 490 days in captivity, said Stephen Brisley, Lianne's brother. Lianne met Eli Sharabi on a three-month work experience assignment at Kibbutz Be'eri, married and then made her home in Israel. Naturally, the bear came along. Growing up in Wales, the bear was part of the family. When they were being naughty, her brothers would hide the bear from her, or stick it in a drawer with only its toes dangling out, Stephen remembered. It also participated in tea parties on the bedroom floor and sat in the audience as the kids pretended to hold rock concerts with tennis rackets for guitars and broomsticks for microphones. For a family that isn't religious and doesn't find strength in prayer, the bear now provides a link to lost loved ones. 'Mom has found it a great comfort to speak to Lianne's bear, and she says basically she speaks to the bear every morning, every evening and she speaks to the bear as though she's talking to Lianne,' Stephen said. 'I think it's been a cathartic experience for her. It's a tangible sort of physical connection to somebody that you can't have that real hug with.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj2wcnhkje	2025-02-08T11:45:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/BJG1WSBKkl/BJG1WSBKkl_0_105_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
With hostage deal advancing, IDF to fully withdraw from Gaza's Ne...	As part of hostage deal, Israel to complete pullback from strategic corridor—symbol of both IDF operations and settler aspirations; troops to remain only in buffer zone and Philadelphi Corridor As part of the latest phase of the hostage release agreement, the IDF is set to complete its withdrawal from its last positions along the Netzarim Corridor overnight into Sunday, marking the full military pullback from northern Gaza. This strategic corridor, seized by the 36th Division during the initial incursion into Gaza, had served as a key operational route, linking Israeli forces advancing from the coastal axis with those pushing inland. The withdrawal comes despite Israeli threats of retaliation over Hamas' exploitation of freed hostages in propaganda videos and the shocking images of their frail condition after months in captivity. Neither the IDF nor Israeli political leadership has commented on the planned pullback, which will leave only IDF forces in the buffer zone near the border and along the Philadelphi Corridor in southern Gaza. Netzarim Corridor had become a symbol of Israel’s military presence in Gaza, with right-wing settler activists viewing it as a potential foothold for re-establishing Jewish settlements in northern Gaza. Groups such as Nachala, a movement advocating for Israeli resettlement in the Gaza Strip, held mass gatherings at the corridor's entrance, treating it as a symbolic gateway to territories they aim to reclaim. The withdrawal from Netzarim began last month, allowing over half a million displaced Palestinians to return north from southern Gaza. Images of masses moving northward, widely circulated across global media, showed armed Hamas operatives directing civilians along the corridor.

Alongside the IDF withdrawal, IDF officials have raised alert levels in the West Bank, anticipating celebrations over the upcoming release of additional Palestinian prisoners. In recent days, the IDF and Shin Bet have held meetings with the families of prisoners due to be freed, while conducting preemptive operations to remove Hamas flags and terrorist symbols from public areas. The Etzion Regional Brigade has also prepared for large-scale celebrations in refugee camps such as Dheisheh, near Bethlehem, making clear that public displays of support for terrorism will not be tolerated. Meanwhile, the Israeli Civil Administration has issued warnings through its military coordination offices, saying that parades and public gatherings celebrating the release of convicted terrorists are strictly prohibited. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjqvz4ry1l	2025-02-08T10:46:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/Byso6sNdke/Byso6sNdke_0_0_2778_1564_0_small.jpg
Held in Hamas tunnels, clueless about October 7—freed hostages on...	Starvation and humiliation can’t be hidden': Despite Hamas’ attempts to improve conditions before release, frail, starved hostages tell different story; Or Levy and Eli Sharabi unaware families murdered, while Ohad Ben Ami spent most of his captivity underground After 491 days underground in Hamas captivity, Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy returned to Israel, frail and emaciated, with little knowledge of the devastation of October 7 or the fate of their families. The three men, abducted in the early hours of the Hamas attack, spent most of their captivity underground, deprived of sunlight, communication and reliable information. Some were occasionally exposed to Al Jazeera broadcasts, but many details remained unknown. Or Levy only learned after his release that his wife, Einav, had been murdered, while Eli Sharabi was informed by his siblings that his wife and daughters were also killed in the massacre, and his brother Yossi died in captivity. In the week leading up to their release, the hostages were given more food and water, likely due to increased humanitarian aid shipments and Hamas' effort to present them in better condition. Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, a senior Health Ministry official, described the long-term damage inflicted on the hostages. 'Hamas prepares the hostages for their staged release, trying to make them appear healthier,' she said. 'But starvation, humiliation and inhumane conditions leave lasting damage. Even those who appear physically well have suffered immensely and face severe long-term consequences from such prolonged captivity.' \Levy, who had no way of confirming his wife’s fate, was at one point told by his captors that his brother Michael had spoken on his behalf at the UN Security Council, a rare acknowledgment from his jailers that his family was fighting for him. On October 7, Levy and his wife Einav were attending the Nova music festival. As Hamas launched its attack, the couple fled into a roadside shelter along with dozens of others, seeking safety. The shelter became a site of mass slaughter, with Einav and 26 others killed, while Or was taken hostage. After his release from Hamas captivity, he finally reunited with his 3-year-old son Almog. But alongside the relief of freedom came the devastating news that Einav was murdered in the same shelter where they had taken refuge. Held in a Hamas tunnel for over a year, without communication or knowledge of the outside world, Levy had only suspected his wife had been killed. It was only after his release that his family confirmed the truth. Geula Levy, Or’s mother, described her son’s first accounts from captivity, saying he had asked about other victims from the shelter. 'He knows what happened there,' she said. 'He knew Hersh Goldberg-Polin was injured, and he thought he had been freed. He asked if we had heard his name.' Goldberg-Polin, a dual Israeli-American citizen, was executed in Hamas captivity in late August. Levy had also assumed that Almog Sarusi, another hostage later murdered in a Hamas tunnel alongside Goldberg-Polin, had survived. 'He was convinced that Hersh and Almog had both returned home,' his mother said. Geula shared one of the haunting details Or recalled about his time underground—the complete disconnection from the outside world. 'I asked him if he was cold in the tunnel,' she said. 'He told me, ‘You don’t feel temperature down there. We couldn’t tell if it was summer or winter.’' 'His face tells the world the hell he endured' 'Our hearts tremble, and our minds refuse to believe the sight of Or, who has returned to us in such dire condition,' his family said in a statement. 'His face tells the world the hell he endured for 491 days at the hands of Hamas monsters. 'After 491 painful days of waiting and longing, our Or has finally come home. After an unbearable period of darkness, we can finally hold him again and begin healing his body and spirit. Words cannot capture the depth of emotions we feel at this moment—overwhelming pain, relief, tears of joy alongside deep sorrow for the time stolen from us. We embraced him tightly, tighter than ever before, and yet it is still hard to believe he is truly here. We eagerly await the moment when little Almog and Or will finally reunite, a hug we have been waiting for with every breath. 'Amid all this emotion, our thoughts turn to Einav, of blessed memory, Almog’s mother, who was murdered on that cursed day. Her loss has left an immeasurable void in our hearts. We believe she is watching from above, finding comfort in seeing Almog finally receive his father’s embrace. Her memory and legacy will always be with us.' The family also expressed their deep gratitude to the people of Israel: 'Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the warm embrace, the unwavering support and the companionship throughout this difficult journey. Every person who stood by us, every word, every gesture, every prayer meant the world to us.' 'This period has left deep scars, and our hearts are still learning to believe that the nightmare is over,' the family added. 'These moments are overwhelming and filled with intense emotions of every kind. We need this time as a family—to gather, to breathe, to process and to begin the healing and recovery process.' They thanked the public for its interest and support but asked for privacy. 'Please respect our space and allow us the quiet we need at this time.' Meanwhile, families of previously released hostages expressed frustration over comparisons between the condition of Or Levy, Ohad Ben Ami and Eli Sharabi and those freed in earlier rounds. Many called to avoid comparing one captivity experience to another, emphasizing that each hostage suffered in different ways. At the same time, nearly all hostages released in previous deals watched the latest release closely, and their families joined public calls urging the government to bring the remaining hostages home as soon as possible. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj2awqskkg	2025-02-08T10:21:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/BJPZPn4Y1x/BJPZPn4Y1x_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Freed hostage Eli Sharabi learns of family’s tragic fate after 49...	‘His condition is extremely difficult’: In heart-wrenching moment, Sharabi embraces his brother Sharon, who fought tirelessly for his release, as he learns wife and daughters murdered on October 7 and brother Yossi died in captivity Eli Sharabi, frail and pale after 491 days in Hamas captivity, was reunited with his family on Saturday, only to be confronted with devastating news—his wife Lian and daughters, Noya, 16, and Yahel, 13, were murdered in the October 7 massacre, and his brother Yossi died in captivity. In an emotional scene at Sheba Medical Center, Sharabi, wrapped in an Israeli flag, embraced his brother Sharon, who had fought tirelessly for his release. 'Eli’s condition is extremely difficult,' a family member said. 'Beyond the physical toll and severe malnutrition, he has now learned the most painful truth imaginable. He is trying to process it. Right now, we’re giving him time with his mother and siblings. Tomorrow, he will likely meet with the extended family, who will stand by him as he begins his recovery.' Despite the overwhelming grief, friends and relatives emphasized Sharabi’s determination to rebuild his life. 'Even with all the pain and loss, Eli is strong and determined to survive and heal,' they said. Sharabi, 51, was abducted from his home in Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7, along with his brother Yossi, who died in Hamas captivity early last year. Israeli intelligence believes he was killed when the IDF struck a building near where he was being held. His body remains in Gaza.

Since his brothers were taken hostage, Sharon Sharabi had led a relentless campaign for their return. In a moving moment at the hospital, Sharon, draped in a prayer shawl, embraced Eli with tears in his eyes, whispering prayers. Ahead of Eli’s release, Sharon reflected on the family’s painful journey. 'When we learned that Yossi did not survive captivity, I said, ‘We failed,’' he recalled. 'But when Eli returns, I will say, ‘We have won.’ Not just me—an entire nation.' The conflicting emotions of relief and sorrow were evident in his words. 'Our hearts are bursting with emotion, but there is also immense pain,' he said. 'Pain for October 7, for the 16 months of suffering, for the brother Eli lost, for his wife and daughters who are gone. After everything he endured, he is coming back to a completely different reality—a nightmare. No wife, no daughters, no home. All we can do is embrace him, show him we are here and never leave his side.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syqfg7ryyg	2025-02-08T09:46:13-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/BySpK00ZHFJg/BySpK00ZHFJg_0_35_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Hostages’ condition worse than previous releases, hospital says	Dr. Yael Frenkel-Nir, Director of Sheba General Hospital and head of the medical response team for returning hostages, said that the effects of 491 days in Hamas captivity were clearly visible on the two released hostages brought to the hospital. 'Their medical condition is poor, and this time it is even worse,' she said in a press briefing from the hospital. 'Such inhumane conditions have severe health consequences. Based on our experience, prolonged captivity has resulted in a significant deterioration in their state, and we are deeply and gravely concerned for those who remain in Hamas hands.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryeulxrfyl	2025-02-08T09:19:12-08:00

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued his first statement following the release of Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy from captivity on Saturday, vowing that Israel will do everything to bring back all hostages and eradicate Hamas. 'Once again, we have seen the true nature of Hamas—the monsters who massacred our citizens and abused our hostages,' Netanyahu said. 'And I say to them again: their blood is on their own heads.' Netanyahu said he had instructed Israel’s negotiating delegation to convey a clear message to mediators that securing the return of all hostages is Israel’s top priority. 'Beyond that, President Trump fully agreed with me: we will do everything to bring our hostages home—but Hamas will not be there. We will eliminate Hamas and bring our people back.

I need to know what happened that day': Ohad Ben Ami seeks answe...	After 491 days in captivity, freed hostage reunites with his wife Raz and daughters, joking about his drastic weight loss: 'I left XXL and came back a medium'; stunned by his daughter Natalie’s enlistment in the IDF, he also reflects on his ordeal After 491 days in Hamas captivity, Ohad Ben Ami was reunited Saturday evening with his three daughters at Sourasky Medical Center in Tel Aviv, following an earlier meeting with his wife, Raz Ben Ami, herself a former hostage. As his daughters embraced him, one of them cried out, 'There you are! Dad!' to which Ben Ami responded, 'I’m here. My lionesses. You are amazing.' His daughter Natalie, who had enlisted in the IDF after her father was taken hostage, revealed the news to him for the first time, leaving him visibly stunned. 'Dad, I’m a commander in a military welfare course,' she told him. 'Did Mom even allow you to enlist?' he asked, as one of his other daughters admitted, 'It took a long time and a lot of convincing.' Eventually, Ben Ami smiled and told Natalie, 'I’m proud of you. Proud that you didn’t listen to your mother.' She immediately shouted back, 'I knew it!' During the meeting, Ben Ami joked about his drastic weight loss, quipping, 'I left extra-extra-large and came back a medium,' hinting at the horrors he and his fellow hostages endured in Gaza. Following the reunion, Ben Ami’s other daughter, Ella, shared her thoughts in a social media post, writing: 'All this time, I couldn’t express how proud I was of my sister for her brave decision to enlist. We weren’t allowed to talk about it. Now we finally can! Dad is proud of you too.' In another post, Ella described a powerful moment before her father was airlifted to the hospital. She said he asked for her advice on whether he should exit the helicopter discreetly through the medical corridor or be filmed wrapped in the Israeli flag. 'There was no question—he stepped out proudly, draped in his country’s flag, showing that he is a hero.' Reflecting on the time lost during captivity, Ben Ami acknowledged he had many unanswered questions—especially about the October 7 attack that led to his abduction. 'Time moves forward. It has been a year and four months, and I have a million loose ends,' he said. 'I know I’m going to receive some very painful answers, but I need to know what happened that day.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ben Ami also revealed that he was held in Hamas’ tunnel network, describing the cramped and harsh conditions. 'In the tunnel I was in, we constantly had to crouch,' he recalled. 'At one point, I hit my head hard.' Ben Ami, 56, was abducted from his home in Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7. Footage of him being forced away by Hamas terrorists, dressed only in a T-shirt and boxer shorts, became one of the defining images of the massacre. Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, head of the Health Ministry’s Medical Division, provided an update on the condition of Ben Ami and fellow freed hostages Eli Sharabi and Or Levy. 'This morning, upon their release, we saw clear signs of severe malnutrition—stark evidence of the hell they endured,' she said. 'We saw significant weight loss. These are difficult images to process, yet their resilience offers hope for recovery.' Speaking to Ynet, Dr. Mizrahi emphasized that the hostages had been held in different locations under varying conditions, but all suffered physical and psychological harm.

'However, those who have come back are walking, talking and fully aware of their situation.' Still, she cautioned against judging their condition by outward appearances.

Leadership was aware of hostages’ dire condition before release, ...	The political leadership was fully informed of the deteriorating health of the freed hostages long before their release, senior Israeli officials said Saturday, responding to public outrage over the frail and emaciated appearance of Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy. 'Unlike the public reaction, which has been one of shock and distress, the government had a clear understanding of the hostages' condition, including the specific state of those freed today,' one official said. 'Anyone familiar with the facts was not surprised at all.' The Israeli government has faced growing pressure to accelerate efforts to free the remaining hostages, with families and advocacy groups demanding an immediate expansion of negotiations to secure their return before their condition worsens further.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk3swzbkje	2025-02-08T08:42:27-08:00	
Freed hostage Or Levy reunites with son, 3, learns wife murdered ...	After 491 days in Hamas captivity, Levy reunites with his 3-year-old son, Almog, who told him, 'Daddy, it took you too long to come back'; only after his release did Levy learn for certain that his wife, Einav, was murdered Or Levy, who was held hostage by Hamas for 491 days, was finally reunited with his 3-year-old son, Almog, on Saturday after being freed as part of a hostage exchange deal. However, it was only upon his return to Israel that Levy learned with certainty that his wife, Einav, had been murdered in the October 7 attack. Levy and Einav had been together in a shelter at the Nova music festival when Hamas terrorists stormed the site. While Or was taken hostage, Einav was killed alongside hundreds of others. Also with them in the shelter was Hersh Goldberg-Polin, another hostage later executed in captivity. Levy, frail and visibly weak, was airlifted to a hospital, where he embraced his family and met Almog for the first time since his abduction. 'Daddy, it took you too long to come back,' Almog told him in a heartbreaking moment. Michael Levy, Or's brother, had waited for hours at the Re’im reception center, near the Gaza border, anticipating his return. 'I can't breathe. I'm here with our parents, waiting,' he told Ynet. 'I brought a drawing from Almog and left it on the bed in Or’s hospital room. I also packed some of his clothes so he’d have something from home. I can’t process any of this yet.' After finally hugging his brother, Michael described the moment as overwhelming. 'There are no words to describe this joy. This is the most emotional thing I’ve ever experienced,' he said. 'The first thing Or told me was that he missed me. He thanked me and apologized for the time we lost. I told him we have plenty of time ahead to make up for it.' Their mother, Geula Levy, revealed in a radio interview that Or had been held in a tunnel with no communication and could only guess what had happened to Einav. 'Today, he asked, and we told him the truth,' she said. While in captivity, Or had no way of knowing the fate of others in the shelter, including Goldberg-Polin and Almog Sarusi, both of whom were murdered in Hamas tunnels. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Or knows what happened in the shelter,' Geula said. 'He knew Hersh had been injured but assumed he had been freed. He asked me if we had heard his name. He also believed Almog Sarusi had survived.' She recounted a chilling detail from Or’s account of the attack: 'He told us he threw the last grenade.' Before their emotional reunion, Michael said the family was preparing to ensure the meeting between Or and Almog would be as smooth as possible. 'Or was thrilled when he saw Almog’s drawings. I’ve never seen him like this before,' Michael said. 'He kept asking about him, and we showed him videos and photos. He was in awe of his incredible little boy.' When they finally met, Almog’s first words to his father were, 'Daddy, it took you too long to come back.' Levy was transferred to the Red Cross by Hamas terrorists, appearing pale, frail and visibly weak. Michael remained optimistic despite the harrowing images of Or’s condition. 'He’s back. He will recover. He will be okay,' he said. 'Almog kept asking, ‘When will Daddy get here?’' Michael added that Or was aware of everything happening around him but remained mentally strong. 'He’s lost weight and will need time to recover physically, but he’s resilient. He even joked with us about the situation,' he said. Levy’s friends and coworkers eagerly awaited his return, gathering together to watch the moment unfold. 'We can’t wait to hug him and be with him,' said Eden Ben Shimon, a close friend. 'We didn’t sleep all night. We’re like family, and this is overwhelming. We don’t know what to expect, but we’ll be here for him no matter what.' Danny Geishis, another friend, shared a bittersweet reflection: 'We lost Einav on October 7, but at least today, we are getting something back. Or is coming home, and it’s a celebration.' Levy, a resident of Givatayim near Tel Aviv, was abducted from the Nova music festival, where he had gone with Einav while leaving Almog, then just two years old, with his grandparents. Their love for music, festivals and travel had defined them as a couple. Before his release, Geula Levy spoke of her anticipation, expressing the relief and heartbreak of waiting for her son for over a year. 'My heart is racing. For a year and four months, this little boy—our Almog—has been without his mother or father. Finally, Or is coming home. I can’t believe it,' she said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bys9zfhy1l	2025-02-08T08:36:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/Sk9VwC4tkg/Sk9VwC4tkg_0_38_1223_689_0_small.jpg
Israel weighs response to Hamas’ handling of freed hostages as ne...	Israel faces limited response options after frail condition of freed hostages sparks outrage, as officials focus on securing more releases; delegation heads to Doha for talks on Phase I of deal, while Hamas warns of collapse The disturbing images of Or Levy, Ohad Ben Ami and Eli Sharabi—frail and visibly malnourished after 491 days in Hamas captivity—have sparked outrage in Israel. However, officials acknowledge that Israel’s options for an immediate response are limited as the hostage release process continues. While reducing humanitarian aid to Gaza or delaying the release of Palestinian prisoners have been raised as possible responses, both would constitute a violation of the cease-fire deal. Another option—terminating the agreement altogether—is seen as unlikely, as Israel remains committed to securing the release of more hostages beyond the 33 scheduled in Phase I. The anger toward Hamas is growing, but officials say that rather than breaking the deal, it is likely to pave the way for a return to fighting once the current phase ends, unless an extension is reached. A senior Israeli official confirmed that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered a negotiation team to travel to Doha to discuss the technical aspects of the agreement. Upon his return from the United States, Netanyahu is expected to convene a Security Cabinet meeting to discuss the next phase of the hostage deal. Following reports that the cabinet meeting will only take place next week, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum issued a sharp response, questioning why Israel’s leaders were not convening immediately. 'How, after the shocking images of Eli, Ohad and Or, is the Cabinet not meeting right away?' the group said in a statement. 'What more proof is needed for decision-makers to grasp the critical urgency of rescuing the remaining 76 hostages? The prime minister must send the negotiating team to Qatar with a clear and full mandate—to finalize the deal swiftly and secure the return of every last hostage with a defined plan and timeline.' As part of Netanyahu’s new approach to negotiations, Hostage and Missing Persons Coordinator Brig. Gen. (res.) Gal Hirsch will travel to Doha for the first time. He will be joined by M., the former deputy head of the Shin Bet, whose participation was strongly advocated by Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar. Another senior official from the Shin Bet director’s office, who was involved in previous negotiation rounds, will also be part of the team. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The talks in Doha will focus solely on finalizing Phase I of the deal, with negotiations on Phase II set to begin only after Israel’s position is approved by the Cabinet. Meanwhile, a senior Hamas official warned in an interview with AFP that the agreement is at risk of collapse, saying that Hamas 'does not want to resume the war' and is 'ready' to continue negotiations. He also called on Arab nations to refrain from normalizing ties with Israel. Meanwhile, National Unity Party MK Gadi Eisenkot suggested an alternative approach—'compressing' the deal timeline to secure hostage releases more quickly. 'The horrific images of Or, Eli and Ohad returning to Israel are yet another painful reminder of the unbearable cost of waiting and delays,' Eisenkot said. He criticized the government for approving Netanyahu’s proposed three-phase deal only after months of delay and called for immediate action. 'The government’s duty is clearer than ever in light of today’s images—grant the delegation a clear and immediate mandate to travel to Qatar and shorten the timeline for implementation. The Israeli people are paying an unbearable price, minute by minute, with extreme suffering and ongoing life-threatening risks.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryai611sfjl	2025-02-08T08:08:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/BJvs5iVYye/BJvs5iVYye_0_300_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

The three Israeli hostages freed Saturday after 491 days in Hamas captivity are suffering from severe malnutrition and significant weight loss, said Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, head of the Medical Division at the Health Ministry, describing their condition as a stark illustration of the hardships they endured. 'They are home,' Mizrahi said in the first update on the medical condition of the three hostages—Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy. 'They have returned after 491 days in which their basic right to live freely was taken from them.' Mizrahi described severe malnutrition and significant weight loss among the hostages, calling the images from their release 'difficult to watch.' 'This morning, we witnessed signs of extreme malnutrition—a stark illustration of the hell they endured,' she said. Despite their physical condition, Mizrahi noted the resilience of the former captives, saying: 'We were moved to see them walk upright, with heads held high, even as they passed through a crowd of armed Hamas terrorists.' The three freed hostages are now reunited with their families at Israeli hospitals, where they are undergoing medical evaluations and treatment. 'Their strength gives us great hope for their recovery and rehabilitation,' Mizrahi said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyolalhtjl	2025-02-08T06:51:19-08:00	
We love Israel': Freed Thai hostages return home after release f...	After 482 days in captivity and 10 days of rehabilitation tailored to their culture, former captives depart for their native Thailand with heartwarming send-offs After 482 days in Hamas captivity and 10 days of rehabilitation in Israel, five Thai nationals freed from Gaza departed Saturday morning for their return home to Thailand. The men—Sathian Suwannakham, 34, Pongsak Thenna, 35, Bannawat Seathao, 27, Watchara Sriaoun, 32, and Surasak Lamnau, 30—were released earlier this month as part of the ongoing cease-fire and hostage exchange deal. The five former hostages bid farewell to Israeli and Thai medical staff who had cared for them at Shamir Medical Center (Assaf Harofeh) in a departure ceremony featuring flags, banners and warm send-offs. As they embraced hospital staff and bowed in a traditional Thai gesture of gratitude, they expressed their appreciation, calling out 'We love you, thank you very much.' Hospital staff and Thai Foreign Ministry representatives, who had assisted in their recovery, waved Israeli and Thai flags and held up signs in Thai script, reading 'Safe travels home.' Four of the men's family members, who had flown in from Thailand, accompanied them on their journey back to Bangkok, alongside a rescue team representative from Thailand. During their stay at the Israeli hospital, efforts were made to tailor their care to Thai cultural preferences. Meals included rice at every serving, supplemented with fresh fruits and vegetables. Bilingual signage was posted throughout the facility, and medical staff wore name tags in both Thai and Hebrew. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Psychological and medical care was provided by professionals from both countries, including Thai military personnel, a trauma doctor and a psychiatrist from Thailand, as well as a Thai-speaking Israeli psychologist and representatives from the Thai embassy. Hospital director Dr. Osnat Levtzion-Korach said that continued treatment plans had been developed for them in Thailand, funded by Israel. She noted that while their physical and mental conditions had improved significantly, they still suffered from lasting injuries. One required a hearing aid, others had lost teeth and some had sustained gunshot wounds that still required further medical care. On Friday evening, ahead of their departure, the five men visited a shopping mall, where they were given a budget to buy gifts for their families and later dined at a Thai restaurant. Before leaving the rehabilitation center, they left messages on a farewell board in both Thai and Hebrew, writing: 'Everyone here is kind. We love you and we love Israel.' When asked if they would ever return to Israel, Seathao responded 'Maybe', while Sriaoun simply said, 'I love you. Thank you.' Meanwhile, Thai officials continue efforts to locate and secure the release of one remaining Thai hostage, Pinta Nattapong, 35, whose whereabouts and condition remain unknown. Additionally, two Thai nationals—Sonthaya Oakkharasri, 30, and Sudthisak Rinthalak, 43—were murdered on October 7 while working in kibbutz orchards near Be’eri. Their bodies are still held in Gaza, with ongoing diplomatic efforts to secure their return. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjkvuxbyjx	2025-02-08T06:38:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/B1vpfioEYJg/B1vpfioEYJg_0_31_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Officials pledge to hold Hamas accountable after 3 freed hostages, who appeared frail, paraded in public ceremony before their release and warn of consequences for repeated cease-fire violations Israeli officials condemned the harsh conditions and treatment of three hostages released by Hamas on Friday, after footage showed them appearing frail and pale, being led onto a stage by armed terrorists in a public ceremony in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza before being handed over to the Red Cross. Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy were freed as part of the ongoing cease-fire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. Brig. Gen. (res.) Gal Hirsch, Israel’s coordinator for missing and captive persons, said the 'disturbing images' from their release will not go unanswered. 'Israel takes Hamas' repeated violations of the agreement very seriously, and appropriate actions will be taken,' Hirsch said, adding that the message had been conveyed to mediators. 'The shocking sights we witnessed today touch us all and add to the painful memory of October 7, 2023,' Hirsch said. 'Israel views these repeated violations by Hamas with the utmost severity, particularly the condition of the three hostages released today. Together with their families, we embrace Ohad, Eli and Or. We have prepared for their return and will assist in their recovery and rehabilitation after their prolonged and painful captivity.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israel estimates that 76 hostages remain in Hamas captivity, including both living individuals and those killed in captivity. Hirsch said the Israeli government remains fully committed to securing their return and is working relentlessly with all security agencies to bring them home. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who remained in Washington for the weekend, monitored the hostages’ release from afar. His office issued a statement reaffirming the government’s commitment to securing the return of all hostages, adding: 'The shocking images from today will not be ignored. The government, together with all security agencies, will support the freed hostages and their families.' Former defense minister Yoav Gallant also condemned the poor health of the freed hostages, saying the images highlight their deteriorating condition, which Israel had long been aware of. 'This is yet another signal that we must act decisively to bring the hostages home,' Gallant said. 'Hostage rescue is a Jewish, human and moral imperative.' Gallant reiterated that Israel remains committed to defeating Hamas and punishing its leaders. 'This is a declared war objective, a value that generations of Israeli fighters have been raised on—we do not leave the wounded behind,' he said. 'We will continue striking Hamas, and those responsible for these crimes will face justice. I hope for the swift return of all hostages and stand with their families as they wait to reunite with their loved ones.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rycdk1rfye	2025-02-08T05:35:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/Hk56asVKkl/Hk56asVKkl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Blood on your hands!': Pro-Palestinians shout at Yoav Gallant in...	Visiting New York for the first time since being fired from his position as Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant ran into pro-Palestinian protesters who called for his arrest; 'War criminal! Why should he be able to walk the streets of New York?', they yelled Pro-Palestinian demonstrators shouted at former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in New York, accusing him of being a 'war criminal' who 'should be arrested.' Gallant, against whom, along with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, international arrest warrants have been issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, was filmed leaving a business in the city when several passersby began shouting at him as he made his way to his car. 'You have the blood of 61,000 Palestinians on your hands,' they shouted. 'Why should he be able to walk the streets of New York?' After a few minutes, Gallant entered his car accompanied by his security guards. Footage of the incident was published on the social media account of a local left-wing organization on the platform X (formerly Twitter). Alongside the footage, the organization wrote: 'War criminal Yoav Gallant confronted on the streets of New York by pro-Palestinians! The former Israeli Defense Minister, who has an arrest warrant for his war crimes against humanity issued by the ICC, will not live peacefully for a single day! People around the world stand with Palestine and against Israel's violent apartheid regime. We will continue to fight every day until the full liberation of the Palestinian people. There will be no rest for the wicked.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Earlier, more than 500 pro-Palestinian protesters, many wrapped in keffiyehs, gathered in Chicago outside the 'Anshe Emet' synagogue to protest Gallant's participation in an event organized by Friends of the IDF (FIDF). While Gallant was inside the synagogue, one of the protest organizers said, 'Palestinians and our Jewish allies who oppose the war will continue to protest, disrupt, and demand the arrest of Gallant and anyone else who supports genocide, across the United States.' Other protesters chanted 'From the river to the sea,' while some submitted a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice's Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section, demanding a criminal investigation be opened against the former Defense Minister. In his first interview since becoming Defense Minister, a position from which he was dismissed about three months ago, Gallant told Nadav Eyal that he is not afraid of the arrest warrants issued against him. 'I am proud to be accused of defending the State of Israel. When leaders and others from around the world came to me, I told them, ‘2023 is not 1943. Jews now have the ability to defend themselves independently, and I am responsible for that, and I will do it. That’s what I did, and I am proud of what I did,’' he emphasized. He acknowledged that mistakes may have been made during the war that led to 'heavy costs,' but he clarified: 'I think our mistakes are smaller than those of other armies. The results are always harsh, and I regret that. I also did not want to harm any Palestinian civilian. And I am not the only one.

As part of the fifth phase of the deal, Israel will release 183 prisoners, including 18 serving life sentences; Among those freed are Hamas operatives convicted of terror attacks, including bombings in the southern city of Be’er Sheva and other deadly assaults As part of the fifth phase of Stage A of the deal, during which hostages Ohad Ben Ami, Or Levy, and Eli Sharabi will be released, Israel will on Saturday release 183 prisoners, including 18 serving life sentences. Among them are 54 prisoners who have served long sentences and 111 detainees from Gaza who were arrested during the war. Among the prominent prisoners being released is Shadi Barghouti, who was sentenced to 27 years in prison for his involvement in attacks against Israel. His father, Fakhri Barghouti, was a participant in the murder of Mordechai Yakuel, and his brother, Hadi Barghouti, was convicted in 2004 of terrorist activities and sentenced to three and a half years in prison. Another prisoner being released is Ali Haroub, a resident of Dura, who has been serving a sentence for membership in a terror cell that planned attacks and for his involvement in the production of explosives and Molotov cocktails. In December 2013, Shin Bet, with the assistance of Israel Prison Service (IPS), thwarted an attempt to establish a kidnapping cell that Haroub was part of, under the guidance of prisoners in Israel. The attempted attack, which was in its early planning stages, was prevented. Senior Hamas figure Jamal Tawil, who was arrested in Ramallah in June 2021, will also be released. At the time of his arrest, IDF stated that Tawil was detained following a joint operation by the Duvdevan Unit and Shin Bet. It was noted that he was one of the key figures responsible for rebuilding Hamas’ infrastructure in the West Bank region. According to IDF, Tawil 'actively participated in organizing riots, incitement to violence, and the re-establishment of Hamas' headquarters in Ramallah.' Among those being released is Eyad Abu Shahidam, who was behind the double suicide bombing in the southern city of Be'er Sheva carried out by two Palestinian terrorists in 2004. The attack killed 16 Israelis and injured over 100. Abu Shahidam was convicted of preparing the explosives and planning the detonation of two bombs on buses near the city hall on Reger Street. He was also convicted of preparing an explosive belt for a terrorist who was intercepted in July 2004 on his way to detonate the bomb at 'Café Kafeit' in Jerusalem. The terrorist was armed with an explosive belt and a pistol and planned to first shoot the security guard before entering the café to carry out the attack. A few days earlier, Shin Bet, IDF, and the Gideonim Unit of the Jerusalem Police arrested several Hamas operatives from Hebron and nearby villages. These operatives admitted to facilitating the terrorist's entry into the capital to carry out the attack. According to their statements, the terrorist had second thoughts and returned.

He is serving six life sentences for the murder of six Israelis during the Second Intifada. Also being released is Yosef al-Mabhouh from Jabaliya, who is serving 15 years in prison for launching rockets, planting explosives, and engaging in tunnel-related activities. In December 2021, while imprisoned in the Hamas wing of Nafha Prison, he carried out a stabbing attack within the prison. He attacked a prison guard with a sharp improvised weapon, causing minor injuries. Footage from the incident shows al-Mabhouh sneaking up behind the guard and assaulting him with the weapon. IPS has operationally prepared for the prisoner release process in accordance with the agreed deal after receiving the list of security prisoners scheduled for release. Once the necessary procedures are completed in the prisons, fighters from the Nachshon Unit, IPS's central escort unit, will transport the prisoners to central reception points at Ofer and Ktzi’ot prisons. Upon arrival, prisoners will be identified by representatives of the Red Cross and will wait until the hostages arrive in Israel. Once approval is granted by state authorities, the prisoners will be transported by the Red Cross from Ofer Prison to release points in the West Bank, and by Nachshon Unit fighters to the Kerem Shalom crossing. Earlier, it was revealed by Ynet that prior to their release, the prisoners will be shown footage of the extensive destruction in Gaza. IDF’s Operations Division, in collaboration with IPS, produced a video showcasing the significant destruction in Gaza, which will be shown to the Palestinian prisoners being released as part of the fifth phase of the deal. The video, approximately three minutes long, will be screened for the prisoners on television screens in the prisons during their release process. Last week, IPS printed the message 'The Eternal Nation Does Not Forget' on the identification bracelets of the prisoners, along with the IPS logo and the Israeli flag. Many of the security prisoners, particularly those serving life sentences, are unaware of the reality outside the prison walls. The video will reflect the new reality in Gaza for them. So far, 583 prisoners have been released as part of the deal. Prior to Saturday’s release, IPS’s prison population, which includes both security and criminal prisoners, actually increased by 298. As of now, there are 23,741 prisoners in Israeli prisons—10,197 of them are security prisoners, and 13,544 are criminal offenders. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjh7h5vkyg	2025-02-08T00:42:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/SJxQ2v00su1g/SJxQ2v00su1g_0_198_2457_1384_0_small.jpg

Israel to receive guided munitions and bombs in $7.4 billion US d...	The US has approved a $7.41 billion military deal with Israel, including Hellfire missiles, bombs, and guidance systems; Officials affirm the sale enhances Israel’s defense capabilities without disrupting regional balance or US military readiness The United States has approved a military sale to Israel, including guided munitions, bombs, and related equipment, with a total value of $7.41 billion. The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced on Friday that it had submitted the required authorization to Congress for the agreements, which are 'intended to preserve Israel's ability to defend itself.' This effectively confirms the move initiated by the administration of former President Joe Biden, who informed Congress of an $8 billion arms deal in January, shortly before Donald Trump assumed office. As part of these agreements, Israel will purchase, using American aid funds, 3,000 Hellfire missiles at an estimated cost of $660 million, along with 2,166 AGM-114 Hellfire bombs, also valued at approximately $660 million. Additionally, Israel will acquire 2,166 GBU-39 bombs, around 13,000 JDAM guidance kits for bombs of various weights, and 17,475 FMU-152A/B fuse bombs under a separate deal valued at $6.75 billion. The supply of Hellfire missiles is expected to begin in 2028, while the additional munitions will be delivered starting from 2025. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to the Pentagon, the equipment will be sourced from existing U.S. stockpiles and from American companies such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and L3Harris. The official statement noted that 'the deal will not alter the regional balance of power and will assist Israel in defending its borders, critical infrastructure, and population.' The State Department stated that the agreements align with U.S. policy to maintain Israel's security and defensive capabilities. The report indicates Israel will be able to integrate the new equipment into its military system with ease and that the deals will not negatively impact U.S. military readiness. Weapons sales are subject to approval by the House and Senate committees, but they are typically approved swiftly when it comes to sales to Israel. According to estimates, the supply will be conducted gradually over the coming years, with initial deliveries starting in 2025. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met this week with evangelical leaders during his visit to Washington. During the meeting, Netanyahu addressed delays in the shipment of munitions during the Biden administration and, for the first time, explicitly acknowledged that this was a 'weapons embargo.' A statement from Netanyahu's office said that he 'thanked the evangelical leaders, who represent millions of believers, for their longstanding and consistent support of the State of Israel.' The meeting was attended by the incoming U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who said: 'We have a responsibility to the Jewish people in Israel and worldwide. You will never stand alone.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjqzak4y1g	2025-02-07T23:30:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/03/07/H1iOCRLaa/H1iOCRLaa_0_0_1000_633_0_small.jpg

Here’s why it’s legal for the U.S. to take over Gaza and relocate...	Human rights lawyer Arsen Ostrovsky argues that those preventing Gazans from leaving are the ones truly violating international law U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to offer Gazans the opportunity to relocate while the U.S., alongside international partners, rebuilds Gaza is 'absolutely legal,' according to international human rights lawyer Arsen Ostrovsky. Speaking to ILTV News, he said, 'Einstein's famous definition is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. And for many, many years, including since October 7, the international community at large has had the same failing strategy with respect to Gaza that essentially allows Hamas to remain in power, and that we know is simply unacceptable.' Ostrovsky emphasized that this would not constitute forcible transfer, which is prohibited under international law. 'What President Trump has spoken about is the intention to create, essentially, a set of circumstances and conditions to allow Gazans to voluntarily choose to move to conditions that are better elsewhere,' Ostrovsky explained. He went a step further, arguing that those insisting Gazans must stay in Gaza—despite Hamas remaining in power—could be the ones violating international law. 'I would actually go one step further and suggest that those that are perhaps in fact guilty here of violating international law are the ones that are insisting that the Gazans stay there. Because by doing so, including whilst Hamas is still in power, they're essentially calling for the Gazans to stay in an active war zone and essentially be continued to be used as human shields by Hamas,' Ostrovsky said. Trump unveiled his plan earlier this week during a press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While Israelis have largely welcomed the proposal, the Arab world has outright rejected it. The plan would involve working with neighboring and moderate Arab states to take in Gazan refugees while the United States rebuilds Gaza, a process that could take upwards of a decade.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1u00yvvkyl	2025-02-07T20:24:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/07/r1lP4ecmFJl/r1lP4ecmFJl_1_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Eliyahu Sharabi, Or Levy and Ohad Ben Ami are set to be released after 491 days in captivity on Saturday during the morning hours; IDF and Israeli hospitals making ready to receive captives, release prisoners The fifth hostage handover in the first phase of the deal between Israel and Hamas in which Eliyahu Sharabi, Or Levy and Ohad Ben Ami are set to be released after 491 days in captivity, is expected to take place on Saturday. Like previous handovers, the three, who were kidnapped from the Nova music festival and Kibbutz Be'eri, will likely be released in the morning from two locations in central Gaza. Israeli officials are uncertain about the exact timing and whether the release will occur from one or two points. The IDF is preparing for an early morning operation. Unlike last week, when Hamas announced the names of those to be freed in the morning, this time, the terror group provided the list to mediators in the evening, again blaming Israel for delays in aid deliveries and cease-fire breaches. Before the names were released, Israel pressured mediators to secure the return of Shiri Bibas and her children, Ariel and Kfir, whom Hamas claims were killed but has provided no proof. The father, Yarden, who was released in the previous handover, said: 'My light is still there, and as long as they are, everything is dark here.' However, Israel’s efforts have so far been unsuccessful.

Gazans tell Trump they will rebuild their own restaurants and hot...	Locals say they are determined to rebuild their own seafront restaurants and hotels, dismissing Trump's vision of creating a 'Riviera of the Middle East' Palestinians in Gaza say they are determined to rebuild their own seafront restaurants and hotels, dismissing U.S. President Donald Trump's vision of creating a 'Riviera of the Middle East' emptied of its population and under U.S. control. Before Israel's 15-month offensive left buildings across Gaza in ruins, the densely inhabited Palestinian territory had developed a local tourism scene on its Mediterranean shore. 'There is nothing that cannot be repaired,' said Gaza resident Assad Abu Haseira, pledging to start serving food from the restaurant he owns even before it is rebuilt. 'Trump says he wants to change the restaurants, and he wants to change Gaza and wants to create a new history for Gaza. We remain Arab and the history of Arabs will not be replaced with the history of foreigners.' Other Palestinians share his defiance. Mohammed Abu Haseira, another restaurant owner, said his eatery would become operational again 'and much better than before'. 'Trump has come up with a decision that he wants to establish restaurants, but the restaurants are here and the hotels are here. Why did you destroy them to establish other ones?' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Gaza was once a popular destination for Israeli tourists and even after the takeover of the territory by the Islamist terror group Hamas in 2007, beachside restaurants and cafes lined its seafront. Trump's vision of a Gaza Strip cleared of its Palestinian inhabitants and redeveloped into an international resort revived an idea previously floated by his son-in-law Jared Kushner. It triggered condemnation from around the world, with critics saying it would be tantamount to ethnic cleansing and illegal under international law. Gazans were also quick to denounce the scheme, vowing never to leave the ruins of their homes. For Palestinians, such talk recalls the 'Nakba' or 'catastrophe' after the 1948 war around the creation of the state of Israel, when 700,000 fled or were forced from their homes. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy5ozknt1l	2025-02-07T11:12:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/BJc8dhlF1g/BJc8dhlF1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

In a statement released on his behalf by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, Bibas wrote: 'On October 7, 2023, I was kidnapped from Israel. On February 1, 2025, I returned to a different country. I knew Israelis unite in times of disaster but I didn’t know just how much. I want to thank everyone who supported me and my family. 'You gave my family and friends strength. I’ve heard all you did for us, and a ‘thank you’ isn’t enough to express my gratitude. To the IDF soldiers —you’re heroes, every single one of you. Thank you.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He added, 'There are still 79 hostages in Gaza, including one of my closest friends. Their families, partners, children and friends are waiting for them. Let’s do everything we can to bring them home. Please, don’t stop — keep fighting to bring them all back. 'I have one last request to the people of Israel: I saw the unity of our amazing nation. Please, let’s not wait for the next disaster to stay united. Unity is our strength.' 'Prime minister Netanyahu, I’m speaking to you in my own words, with no one dictating them: Bring my family back. Bring my friends back. Bring everyone home,' he added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rypcdrxtjx	2025-02-07T10:35:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/07/By7nQ6mKkx/By7nQ6mKkx_177_366_1057_595_0_small.jpg
We found Dad': Hostage Or Levy to return to orphaned 3-year-old ...	After being abducted from the Nova party where his wife was murdered, Levy is set to reunite with his son on Saturday for the first time in 491 days Hostage Or Levy, a 33-year-old from Givatayim, is set to be freed from captivity on Saturday in the hostage deal's fifth handover after 491 days in Gaza. Levy was kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7, where his wife, Einav, was murdered. His mother, Geula, reacted emotionally to the news, saying, 'My heart is leaping from my chest. For a year and four months, the little one [their 3-year-old son, Almog] has been alone without his father and mother. Finally, Or is coming back to us — I can’t believe it.' Gaula added: 'Our military liaison officer updated us — she couldn’t even speak. She’s been with us since the first day. We’re one family. I don’t even know what to say, I’m so excited. I’m not sure if I’ll make it to [the reunion at] Re’im due to some physical limitations. 'I’m just thinking about the hug. How do I hug him after so long? This is a child I talk to every day. We told little Almog, and he screamed, ‘Dad is coming back!’ while he jumped on the bed.' Or and Einav met in high school, became close friends and later married, welcoming their first son, Almog. Family and friends described their shared love for travel and festivals. They arrived at the Nova festival minutes before the rocket barrage began, having left then-2-month-old Almog with his grandparents.

Months later, footage emerged of Or’s abduction. Or’s brother, Michael, posted on Facebook: 'Mogi [Almog's nickname], we found Dad,' adding a yellow heart emoji. He previously recounted: 'Or called our mom when the sirens started. She told him they were at the party. She said they were heading home, so I didn’t panic. 'Even when videos of terrorists on trucks surfaced, I thought they were fake. Around 8:30 a.m., Mom said she couldn’t reach Or. She was crying and I got angry — told her the lines were down and not to be stressed. Two hours later, my uncle called asking about Or. I sensed something was wrong and set up a war room at home.' Michael continued: 'We chased every lead until Wednesday, when we learned Einav was murdered. Or was listed as missing for eight days after October 7 — then they told us he was kidnapped.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjkpdtmkye	2025-02-07T09:49:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/17/ByrUUx211a/ByrUUx211a_0_0_1024_576_0_small.jpg

Or Levy, Eliyahu Sharabi and Ohad Ben Ami set to be released Satu...	Hamas delays delivery of hostage list in fifth handover to late evening while accusing Israel of cease-fire violations and lack of aid in Strip Israel on Friday approved the hostage list provided by Hamas for the deal’s fifth handover expected on Saturday. The three hostages set to be released are Or Levy, 34, Eliyahu Sharabi, 53, and Ohad Ben Ami, 56. The terror group earlier announced it had delivered the list of hostages set to be released Saturday in the fifth hostage handover of the hostage deal's first phase to mediators. Israeli officials awaited the list of names, with an Israeli source saying that Israel 'will view harshly,' any violation of the agreement which included the delivery of hostages' names – though no specific actions were outlined in response. Even before the names were published, Israel pressed the mediators to prioritize – alongside the release of three male hostages – the return of Shiri Bibas and her children Ariel and Kfir, whom Hamas claims are deceased without providing clear evidence. The father, Yarden Bibas, returned to Israel in the previous handout alongside Ofer Caldron and Keith Siegal. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Under the agreement, Hamas must deliver the names one day prior to the release, with no specific time stipulated. The understanding between the sides detailed that the list should arrive by midnight and Israel was confident it would. As in previous instances, Hamas claimed that Israel is not upholding its commitments regarding humanitarian aid and the entry of aid trucks into Gaza. Hamas spokesman Abd al-Latif al-Qanou issued a statement alleging that 'Israel continues to delay implementing the humanitarian protocol, particularly concerning shelter, tents, equipment for debris removal, fuel, and rehabilitation needs.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syhei3xtyx	2025-02-07T08:08:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/07/rkab002XYke/rkab002XYke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

IDF equips troops facing snow in Syria, Lebanon	Logistics Corps forces deliver weapons, warm food and winter gear to troops stationed across the Israeli border facing harsh weather Under constant threat, IDF Logistics Corps forces delivered weapons, food, fuel and other supplies to maneuvering troops beyond the border Thursday overnight in freezing snow. Despite harsh winter conditions, long convoys continue crossing the border to supply the necessary equipment. 'Winter readiness is an integral part of the IDF's operational preparedness,' said IDF Northern Command deputy logistics officer Lt. Col. Fares Nazem. 'We ensure that vehicles, equipment and logistical systems are adapted to extreme weather, providing immediate solutions as needed. Our goal is to enable continuous, safe and effective operations regardless of environmental conditions,' he added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Although the year’s winter has been dry, temperatures in the northern mountains remain frigid. In recent weeks, logistics forces have supplied over 885,000 winter items, including insulated sleeping bags, snow gear and cold-weather clothing, supplementing existing stock distributed throughout the past year of combat. More than 1,900 mobile shelters and containerized living quarters have been deployed at permanent and temporary IDF outposts in Syria and Lebanon. These are equipped with heating, air conditioning, electrical panels and fixed or mobile power infrastructure, ensuring adequate facilities for troops, including showers and heating. Ahead of the weekend, which will remain cold in high-altitude areas beyond the border, troops received hot, fresh meals delivered directly to combat zones. Soldiers stationed in observation posts, snow-covered ambush positions and weapons search operations in Syria and Lebanon will receive rations suited for winter conditions, while infantry units have been equipped with rapid-cooking meal kits. 'We work around the clock to ensure our forces operate under optimal conditions without critical shortages,' Nazem added. 'Even in harsh conditions and at night, we continue complex logistical operations because a strong logistics system is key to sustaining continuous combat. This war has proven that without robust logistics, troop endurance cannot be guaranteed.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1p6q2qfje	2025-02-07T07:52:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/07/r1aecOmY1x/r1aecOmY1x_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg
