Can't wash, can't farm: Iranians battle 'water bankruptcy'	Water levels in dams around Tehran plunge, with water rationing and power cuts expected for summer as rain-starved country wilts under severe drought As Iranians scrubbed their homes and hosed their gardens ahead of Persian New Year celebrations, they were told to slash their water use if the country was to avoid total 'water bankruptcy'. Water levels in dams around the capital have plunged and water rationing and power cuts are forecast for the summer as the rain-starved country wilts under a severe drought. Lakes are disappearing, farmers are struggling and huge sinkholes have appeared in cities as water tables decline. Students worry about washing, kitchen taps run dry and showers are deemed a luxury. The managing director of Tehran's Water and Sewage Department said last week that reserves in key dams supplying nearly all the city's drinking water have dropped to their lowest levels on record, just 5% of capacity. Ahead of New Year festivities starting on March 20, Mohsen Ardakani urged residents to cut water usage by at least 20%. 'This is no longer a choice or an option - it's a necessity to help get us through the difficult times,' he said. Local media have broadcast images of a near-empty Amir Kabir dam (6% full) and the Latian dam (10% full) in the Alborz mountains north of Tehran. Rainfall in the capital is down 17% from last year, and stands 42% below the long-term average. 'They are saying on TV that there may not be any water left for us tomorrow - I go to bed every night worrying about what this situation is doing to the mental and physical health of my loved ones,' said a 43-year-old clothing designer from Tehran, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of official reprisal. 'My father is afraid to take showers and my mother is afraid to drink water with the medicine she needs for her kidney problem. They say they want to save the water for the young generation to use and survive,' she said. Kaveh Madani, director of the U.N. University Institute for Water, Environment, and Health (UNU-INWEH) and a former deputy head of Iran's Department of Environment, said the country was experiencing 'water bankruptcy'. 'If water resources are viewed as assets - surface water as a checking account and groundwater as savings - Iran has depleted its reserves, leaving the public with a situation equal to an overdrawn bank account,' said Madani. 'Now it's spreading to energy and other parts of the economy,' he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, referring to the nation's electricity, natural gas and petroleum shortages. Farmers suffer At a Tehran Council meeting last week, President Masoud Pezeshkian said rapid urban expansion made it impossible to sustain current consumption levels for the 19 million people who live in the capital and surrounding areas. 'Scientists and experts need to sit down together and solve the city's water problems,' Pezeshkian said. According to Iran's National Water Information and Data Office, water flow to dam reservoirs across the country is down 28% from last year. The storage levels of some key dams in 10 provinces have dropped to less than 15% of capacity. This includes reservoirs near Isfahan, Zanjan, Fars and Kerman provinces, where summer temperatures soar above 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit), triggering high demand for cooling systems and water for daily chores. Scientists say the water shortages are mainly caused by decades of mismanagement, inefficient agricultural practices, and a growing population - but have also been exacerbated by rising temperatures due to climate change. Mohsen Mesgaran, assistant professor of plant sciences at UC Davis in California, said agriculture, which accounts for 90% of Iran's water use, is the main driver of the current crisis. 'While it's understandable given that Iran receives only about one fourth of the global average precipitation, agricultural productivity is still remarkably low relative to this limited rainfall,' he said. In the East Azerbaijan province in northwest Iran, a 36-year-old farmer said water shortages were driving fellow farmers out of the area around Lake Urmia, once the largest salt-water lake in the Middle East and now a vast desert. 'Our beloved rivers and lakes have completely dried up. So have our wells and groundwater,' said the farmer from Bonab village, who did not want to give his name for fear of reprisal. 'All the government does is dig deeper wells. I don't know who we need to tell our pain and sorrow to any more.' More than 4 million people work in farming, which accounts for around 20% of total employment in an economy already under pressure from U.S. sanctions. 'It is extremely difficult to reduce agricultural activity unless the government can provide alternative employment opportunities for these farmers,' said Mesgaran. Land subsiding Excessive extraction and depletion of groundwater for farming have caused significant land subsidence with cracks and sinkholes appearing in cities, sometimes swallowing whole cars. In Tehran, the rate of land subsidence is 31 cm a year. In industrial cities such as Isfahan, Khashan and Yazd, any land that lies under highways and airports now risks collapsing. > A 25-year-old university student majoring in psychology in the south-central city of Shiraz, described how water shortages were disrupting her most basic of routines. 'It's getting very hard to do the simplest thing like washing my face and my body - sometimes I have to wait hours for the water to turn back on,' said the student, who did not want to give her name for fear of official reprisals. 'I get especially anxious during my period when I need more water for personal hygiene. When there are water cuts, I sometimes skip university class to avoid the stress of worrying about looking clean,' she said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryr0igcnyx	2025-03-20T12:27:50-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2018/03/29/8438437/8438437_0_113_1300_732_0_small.jpg
Israelis find body in bomb shelter during Houthi missile siren pa...	Running for cover amid first Houthi attack in two months, Holon residents find man's lifeless body lying on shelter floor; police suspect death to be drug-related Residents of an apartment building in central Israel's Holon who rushed to the bomb shelter overnight Thursday following air raid sirens were shocked to discover the lifeless body of a 49-year-old man lying on the floor. Neighbors alerted emergency services, and the body was transferred to the National Institute of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv for examination. Police found no signs of foul play. The death is suspected to be drug-related. The missile attack marked the first Houthi launch against Israel in two months, coming amid renewed fighting in Gaza. Air raid sirens were activated in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area, Jerusalem and the Sharon region. The IDF reported that the single missile was intercepted outside Israeli territory. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to Magen David Adom, 13 people were injured while rushing to shelters and three others suffered from shock. The sirens, which sounded at 3:59 a.m., woke millions across central cities. Several flights to Ben Gurion Airport were delayed due to the attack. The Houthis claimed the missile, which they referred to as a 'hypersonic' Palestine-2 model, was aimed at Ben Gurion Airport. Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree said the strike was in response to 'massacres in Gaza.' Senior Houthi official Nasruddin Amer wrote on X: 'People of Gaza, you're not alone. Allah is with you and so are we.' The terror group also said it had escalated attacks on 'hostile warships in the Red Sea, including the aircraft carrier USS Harry Truman and its accompanying vessels,' adding that the U.S. had failed to prevent the Yemeni missile fire toward Israel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjlvcaynjl	2025-03-20T12:16:31-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/12/ryNLNDJhkx/ryNLNDJhkx_0_77_1280_721_0_small.jpg
US, Israel to hold high-level talks on Iran at White House next w...	Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi to lead Israeli delegation and will meet with senior Trump advisers The United States and Israel will hold high-level talks on Iran's nuclear program at the White House early next week, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The planned meeting follows U.S. President Donald Trump's letter to Iran's leadership earlier this month in which he warned Tehran it had the choice of either striking a nuclear deal with the U.S. or facing possible military action. The Israeli delegation will be led by strategic affairs minister Ron Dermer and national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi and will meet with senior Trump advisers, the Washington-based source told Reuters. The two teams are expected to discuss the potential for U.S.-Iran nuclear talks and regional issues related to Tehran, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Axios was first to report on the scheduled meeting in Washington. Trump said he sent the letter to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's fiercely anti-Western Supreme Leader, who responded that Tehran would not be bullied into negotiations. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Thursday that Tehran will consider the 'opportunities' as well as the threats in Trump's letter. On Saturday, Trump launched large-scale military strikes against Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis over the group's attacks against Red Sea shipping and warned Tehran it will be held accountable if it does not rein them in. Since returning to office in January, Trump has reinstated a 'maximum pressure' campaign aimed at isolating Iran from the global economy and cutting off its oil exports. > During his 2017-2021 term, Trump withdrew the United States from a landmark deal between Iran and major powers that had placed strict limits on Tehran's nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. After Trump pulled out in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions, Iran breached and far surpassed those limits. Western officials fear a nuclear-armed Iran could threaten Israel and Gulf Arab oil producers, and spark a regional arms race. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons. Israel, which is battling Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza, has made clear it wants to be aligned with the U.S. on any action against Israel's regional arch-foe. Last year, Israeli strikes on Iranian facilities, including missile factories and air defenses, in retaliation for Iranian missile and drone attacks, sharply reduced Tehran's conventional military capabilities, according to U.S. officials and outside experts. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s14gelc2je	2025-03-20T12:12:48-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/06/rk62m4Gtyx/rk62m4Gtyx_0_131_1417_798_0_small.jpg

Protest erupts in Jerusalem as government votes on Shin Bet chief...	Demonstration follows earlier clashes between police and protesters, where demonstrators attempted to break through barricades; officers attempt to clear vehicles blocking roadways Thousands of protesters gathered in Jerusalem on Thursday night ahead of a government meeting where ministers were set to vote on the dismissal of Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar. The demonstration began near the residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before marchers proceeded toward government offices. Tensions escalated as footage emerged of police officers smashing car windows with a hammer and a rock at an intersection, allegedly to clear vehicles blocking the roadway. In the video, officers can be seen striking the windows forcefully while passengers remain inside. A police source defended the actions, saying, 'This is how we open the car and tow it.' At one point, an officer was filmed drawing his personal firearm for unclear reasons. On Wednesday, police had issued fines for vehicles left unattended in protest. The demonstration, organized by several activist groups, followed earlier clashes between police and protesters, where demonstrators attempted to break through barricades. Police responded with water cannons and a foul-smelling crowd dispersal substance known as 'skunk.' Former lawmaker Yair Golan, head of the Democrats party, was thrown to the ground by an officer while trying to shield a protester. 'Shoving won’t stop me,' Golan said, later joining the evening rally. Protesters called for the return of Israeli hostages, an end to the war and the prevention of Bar’s dismissal, as well as that of Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara. The government convened Thursday night to approve Bar’s removal, while a separate meeting on Sunday is expected to advance steps to oust Baharav-Miara. Former Likud minister Dan Meridor addressed the crowd, delivering sharp criticism of Netanyahu. 'I am certain that when [former Likud leader] Yitzhak Shamir called Netanyahu an ‘angel of destruction,’ he never imagined the destruction Netanyahu would bring upon Israeli society,' Meridor said. 'The destruction he is leading—this happened in Turkey and Hungary, and now it’s happening in Israel. Our democracy is in danger.' > Meridor also condemned the return of far-right minister Itamar Ben Gvir to the government. 'A disciple of Rabbi Kahane is now a minister? What a disgrace. This government cynically attacks public servants and continues its judicial overhaul to create a hollow democracy,' he said. Former Shin Bet chief Carmi Gillon also took the stage, leveling harsh accusations at Netanyahu. 'Benjamin Netanyahu has the character and soul of a criminal, and his entire mindset is criminal,' Gillon declared. 'The Netanyahu government is a criminal government. What does Netanyahu care if the economy collapses? He is sacrificing the Shin Bet tonight for his own survival, and he will sacrifice the attorney general next.' Gillon warned that 'this may be one of the last protests in democratic Israel—this is a battle for survival.' Golan, who had not planned to speak, took the microphone later in the evening, voicing deep concerns over the government’s actions. 'I came here tonight with fear, in light of the dismissals of the Shin Bet chief and the attorney general. Israel will either remain a liberal democracy or become a messianic theocracy—we will never give up,' he said. 'We will save Israel with the power of the people, through the courageous actions of thousands who woke up on October 7, volunteered and rescued civilians while the government was absent.' 'We will save Israel, dissolve this Knesset. There is no other choice. We will never submit to extremist nationalists,' Golan added. 'This government belongs in the dustbin of history.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkljgxq31g	2025-03-20T11:52:32-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/20/HylxiJJcn1l/HylxiJJcn1l_0_109_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Ex-chief justice Aharon Barak warns: Israel is heading to civil w...	Former Supreme Court chief justice warns of deepening internal divisions, criticizing government's moves on judiciary and opposes dismissal of Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar - urging compromise to prevent further democratic erosion Former Israeli Supreme Court Chief Justice Aharon Barak warned that Israel is at risk of descending into civil war, as the government is expected to approve the dismissal of Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar. Bar’s potential ouster comes as the security agency investigates the so-called 'Qatar-Gate' affair, in which members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office are reportedly involved. 'The main issue facing Israeli society is the ‘eighth front’—the deep rift among Israelis themselves. This divide is worsening, and I fear it will be like a train going off the rails, spiraling into an abyss and leading to civil war,' Barak said in an interview with Ynetnews. Barak, who previously served as attorney general, has recently explored the possibility of a plea deal in Netanyahu’s corruption cases. 'I believe an agreement can be reached,' he said. Once close to Netanyahu, Barak had often praised his commitment to the rule of law. When asked what had changed, Barak replied, 'I don’t know. I can analyze what he does, but I can’t psychoanalyze what’s going on in his head. Meanwhile, we must prevent the tyranny of the majority from using its power simply because it has the votes.' Calls for compromise Barak urged all sides to seek consensus, lamenting that Israeli society no longer values compromise but instead resorts to force. 'The Knesset says, ‘We are a coalition of 64, so we can fire the head of the Shin Bet, dismiss the attorney general, and appoint a politically affiliated judicial ombudsman.’ This must stop. We must also end the culture of political boycotts, as happened in Israel’s early years when Mapai ostracized Herut and the Communist Party. Today, they are targeting Supreme Court President Yitzhak Amit,' he said. Barak called for renewed efforts toward compromise, pointing to President Isaac Herzog’s proposal to establish a state commission of inquiry. Regarding the potential dismissal of Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, Barak said it does not meet the conditions set by the Shamgar Commission. 'She has performed her duties excellently, approving most government actions and rejecting only a few. Her dismissal would harm a key watchdog and make it harder for future officials to do their jobs. It would ultimately hurt every citizen,' he said. Controversy over Shin Bet chief's dismissal, judicial appointments Asked about Netanyahu’s reported intent to fire Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, Barak acknowledged that the government has legal authority to do so under the Shin Bet Law. However, he questioned the reasoning. 'The government claims it has lost confidence in him, but that is not a valid grounds for dismissal. The Shin Bet chief is not a political appointee. His removal should go through a search committee, but beyond that, I believe the dismissal suffers from flaws such as unreasonableness and conflicts of interest. If this case had come before me as a Supreme Court justice, I would have struck down the decision.' The Knesset is set to vote next week on a bill changing the composition of the Judicial Selection Committee. Barak warned that the measure would politicize judicial appointments. 'This is dangerous because it would put the selection of all judges entirely in the hands of politicians, turning every judicial appointment into a political decision. This would severely harm democracy,' he said. Foreign Minister Sa'ar: 'There will be no civil war' Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar responded briefly to Barak’s warning in a post on X (formerly Twitter), writing, 'There will be no civil war.' Barak, known as the architect of Israel’s 'constitutional revolution' during his tenure as Supreme Court president, has been a vocal opponent of Netanyahu’s judicial overhaul. Protests outside Barak’s home have drawn both critics and supporters, with some demonstrators shouting harsh slogans against him, while others moved him to tears with messages of support. > Despite heavy criticism from Netanyahu and his coalition, Barak was chosen by the prime minister to represent Israel at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, where South Africa has accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. Barak was selected in part due to his standing as Israel’s most respected jurist internationally and because he is a Holocaust survivor—factors that were seen as potentially influential among the judges. At the time, Saar praised Barak’s selection, writing, 'In the moment of truth, incitement, defamation, and delegitimization gave way to international standing, decades of earned reputation, and professionalism. I commend the prime minister and the attorney general for this wise and precise decision.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy2ox19n1x	2025-03-20T10:58:31-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/01/07/BkTpmDwci/BkTpmDwci_0_42_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Herzog: Israel cannot fight war while waging political battles at...	President warns against deepening divisions during wartime, as political tensions escalate over military exemptions, Shin Bet head and attorney general dismissals and Netanyahu’s attacks on 'deep state' President Isaac Herzog on Thursday cautioned that the government’s pursuit of controversial policies is threatening national unity at a time when the public is already bearing the burden of war. 'It is inconceivable to send our sons to the front while at the same time promoting controversial measures that deepen divisions within the nation,' Herzog said. His remarks, made during a public address, come amid growing frustration over military service exemptions for ultra-Orthodox men. With thousands of reservists called up in recent weeks, Herzog’s comments reflect the concerns of many Israelis who feel that wartime sacrifice is being unevenly distributed. Herzog’s statement comes as the government moves forward with policies that critics say exacerbate societal rifts. The issue of military conscription for the ultra-Orthodox has long been a flashpoint in Israeli politics, but the war has intensified public scrutiny, with many arguing that all sectors of society should share in the national defense effort. Beyond conscription, Herzog expressed concern over broader political decisions that he believes risk weakening national cohesion. 'Unfortunately, we are witnessing a series of unilateral actions whose impact on national resilience deeply concerns me,' he said. The president also addressed the collapse of the Gaza ceasefire and its devastating impact on hostages and their families. 'We cannot resume fighting to fulfill the sacred duty of bringing the hostages home while ignoring or failing to support their anguished families, who are enduring hell on earth,' he said. 'So many bereaved families, thousands of citizens I meet every week—including today—are pleading and crying out to prevent further division and polarization,' Herzog continued. 'They seek unity, love of Israel, preservation of the state, and a full, comprehensive and independent investigation into the terrible disaster.' Political tensions escalate Herzog’s remarks came just hours before the government was set to vote on the dismissal of Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar. The controversial move has raised concerns about internal instability at a time when Israel is still engaged in a prolonged military campaign. Additionally, on Sunday, ministers are expected to discuss the possible removal of Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, a decision that is likely to spark further political turmoil. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s official X account posted—and later deleted—a statement accusing the 'deep state' of working against right-wing leaders in both Israel and the United States. The post read: 'In America and Israel, when a strong right wing leader wins an election, the deep state, serving the left, manipulates the judicial system to thwart the will of the people. They will not win—not in Israel and not in America. We stand strong together.' > The post was quickly removed but later reuploaded in Hebrew on Netanyahu’s personal account. Shortly afterward, Netanyahu released a TikTok video in which he used artificial intelligence to illustrate what he called the workings of the 'deep state.' Following Netanyahu’s post, Herzog took to his rarely used official X account to issue a contrasting message. 'Israel’s strong and independent judicial system is an asset to our democracy, and the president takes great pride in it,' he wrote. A call for leadership and unity Throughout his speech, Herzog repeatedly emphasized the need for responsible governance during wartime, urging decision-makers to consider whether their actions serve the national interest. 'It is unthinkable not to listen to the people and to seek broad agreements,' he said. 'Even if I am the last one calling for this, I will give everything to achieve understanding and consensus.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byxh3cfhje	2025-03-20T10:38:13-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/HySghLeiiK1e/HySghLeiiK1e_0_114_1280_721_0_small.jpg

How Qatari funding is shaping US and Israeli schools and academia	Report exposes Qatar’s hidden $3B funding to universities and K-12 schools, influencing curricula with anti-Israel narratives; researchers link funds to academic and policy shifts, raising concerns over unchecked foreign influence in US and Israeli In 2011, Dr. Charles Small, then head of the Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism (YIISA), was informed that the center—North America’s first university-based institute dedicated to antisemitism research—would be shut down just five years after its founding. Yale University stated that the center had failed to meet academic expectations. However, researchers and Jewish organizations in the United States pointed to political pressure, particularly from Islamic groups that opposed YIISA’s focus on Muslim antisemitism. Following the closure, Small launched an independent investigation, which he claims provided a 'smoking gun' regarding the real reason behind the decision. 'One of the most vocal opponents of the center within Yale turned out to be anti-Israel and maintained extensive ties with anti-Israel entities,' Small told Shomrim, an Israeli investigative outlet. What initially seemed like an internal university dispute evolved into a broader exposé on foreign influence, particularly from authoritarian regimes—chief among them, Qatar—on American academic institutions. Small, who has held research and teaching positions at leading universities in the U.S. and Israel, said this event spurred further inquiries into funding sources at Yale and other universities. His investigations uncovered hidden financial connections between Qatari entities and institutions across the United States, Europe, and Israel. Billions in undisclosed funding 'In a short time, we identified over $3 billion in donations to Yale and other universities that were not properly reported as required by law,' Small said. In 2019, he presented his findings to senior officials in Washington, prompting a federal investigation that exposed extensive undisclosed foreign funding. Three years ago, Small teamed up with retired Brig. Gen. Sima Vaknin-Gil, Israel’s former chief military censor and director-general of the Strategic Affairs Ministry. Along with a team of 10 researchers and an Israeli forensic accounting firm specializing in global financial investigations, they deepened their inquiry. Their research led to a series of reports detailing the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood and Qatari funding on academic content, the promotion of anti-democratic and anti-Israel agendas, and even antisemitic rhetoric in higher education. Their latest report, released recently, highlights a previously overlooked dimension: Qatari involvement in U.S. elementary and secondary education (K-12). Soft power in early education Small, who now serves as CEO of the New York-based Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy (ISGAP), describes Qatar’s strategy as one of 'soft power,' using vast financial resources to shape narratives and policies through investments in infrastructure, lobbying firms, academia, research, and media. 'The fact that Qatar—a country with fewer than 350,000 citizens—donates more money to American universities, civil society organizations, and cultural institutions than any other nation in the world is deeply troubling,' he said. According to ISGAP, Qatari funding has also reached K-12 education in the United States. One key example is a program called Choices, run under the auspices of Brown University, a prestigious Ivy League institution. Choices provides schools with curricula, books, and teacher training on history, international relations, and human rights. ISGAP’s findings reveal that Choices collaborated with the Qatar Foundation International (QFI), an entity operating under the Qatar Foundation (QF), founded by Sheikha Moza, the mother of Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Documents uncovered by ISGAP show that QFI sponsored teacher training sessions that included Middle East history courses, covering travel and registration expenses for educators. At another event during the COVID-19 pandemic, QFI funded curriculum development for American middle and high school teachers, offering free Middle East studies lesson plans. Though a link to QFI’s website was initially embedded in Choices’ digital materials, it was later removed. ISGAP retained an archived version of the original reference. Shaping narratives in schools Vaknin-Gil, now vice president for strategy at ISGAP, called the findings 'astonishing.' She said QFI, registered as a nonprofit in the U.S., ultimately influences lesson plans that reach about 8,000 schools and millions of children. According to ISGAP’s research, over time, the Choices curriculum shifted from presenting a balanced history of the Middle East to incorporating an overtly anti-Israel narrative, including questioning Israel’s legitimacy. 'This ranged from omitting historical details like the Balfour Declaration and the Abraham Accords to distorting Jewish ties to Israel and even erasing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital,' Vaknin-Gil said. She emphasized that the issue is broader than just Israel. 'A foreign nation is promoting an ideology that is fundamentally anti-Western and anti-democratic, directly influencing American children without any oversight or checks and balances,' she warned. In response to criticism, Brown University issued a statement saying it was committed to academic freedom and diversity of viewpoints. The university denied that Qatar Foundation had any role in developing or reviewing its curricula and stated that 'all foreign-sourced funds are reported in accordance with legal requirements.' Global impact and Israeli connections ISGAP’s research also found that Qatar’s financial influence extends to Israel through a London-based nonprofit called The Galilee Foundation. The foundation states its mission is to 'empower disadvantaged Palestinian youth in Palestine/Israel by turning them into agents of change.' According to its financial reports, 90% of its allocations go to various NGOs in Israel, including scholarship programs for Arab students. Among its notable donors is Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani himself, who contributed 2.4 million pounds (approximately $3 million), deposited in an interest-bearing account to fund Israeli-Arab student scholarships. His mother, Sheikha Moza, also committed to a ten-year funding agreement with the foundation. Other Qatari-linked donors to The Galilee Foundation include the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies in Doha and Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, a Qatari-funded media outlet. Both organizations have ties to Azmi Bishara, a former Israeli lawmaker who fled to Qatar after being accused of espionage for Hezbollah. Bishara is closely linked to the Qatari emir, while his brother, Dr. Marwan Bishara, heads The Galilee Foundation’s board of directors. According to Vaknin-Gil, the indirect funding route through London is deliberate. 'This is a method similar to money laundering—not illegal, but a way to obscure the funding’s origin,' she said. Several Israeli NGOs receive funding from The Galilee Foundation, including Mada al-Carmel, which focuses on Palestinian nationalism, and Baladna, a youth organization that once ran a campaign urging Arab-Israelis to avoid national service. The most prominent beneficiary is the Arab Culture Association, founded by Azmi Bishara himself. The association funds students who serve as teaching assistants in Arab schools, impacting thousands of students. What does Qatar want? Small and Vaknin-Gil argue that Qatar’s funding activities align with the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood, which they say is committed to establishing an Islamic state, eradicating Israel, and undermining Western democracies. 'Qatar is using billions of dollars in unchecked funding to influence decision-makers, academic institutions, media, and other power centers in the West,' Small said. > ISGAP’s research revealed that Qatari-funded universities experience 300% more antisemitic incidents than those without such funding. Their study also found increased anti-Israel rhetoric, suppression of free speech, and even faculty dismissals at these institutions. A 2023 ISGAP report revealed that Texas A&M University, which operates a campus in Doha, received over $1 billion from the Qatar Foundation. This included funding for 500 research projects, some related to sensitive nuclear studies. The disclosure led to widespread scrutiny in the U.S. and ultimately to Texas A&M’s announcement that it would close its Qatar campus. Requests for comment from the Qatar Foundation, QFI, and the Galilee Foundation went unanswered. Any responses received will be added to this report. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b10oetk3ke	2025-03-20T10:14:54-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/20/S15JHPtnkl/S15JHPtnkl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Former Supreme Court chief justice Barak: I fear Israel is headin...	Former Supreme Court chief justice Aharon Barak warned that Israel could face a civil war if internal divisions continue to deepen, particularly amid growing tensions over the expected dismissal of Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar. In an interview with Ynetnews, Barak expressed concern over the government’s anticipated decision to remove Bar while the security agency is investigating the so-called 'Qatar-Gate' affair, which involves members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. 'The biggest threat to Israeli society is the 'eighth front'—the severe rift between Israelis themselves,' Barak said. 'This divide is worsening, and I fear it is like a train going off the rails—spiraling into an abyss and leading to civil war. We must prevent the tyranny of the majority.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk2zkry21l	2025-03-20T10:06:58-07:00	
UN says renewed Gaza violence makes hostage return more distant	The United Nations said on Thursday that each day of renewed violence in Gaza makes the return of the remaining hostages held there a more distant objective. U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for the Middle East Khaled Khiari said the return to hostilities threatens all civilians, including hostages, of whom 24 are thought still to be alive. 'With every passing day, we move further away from the objective of returning the remaining hostages safely to their homes,' Khiari told a U.N. Security Council briefing.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1002vafhke	2025-03-20T09:47:49-07:00

Missile fired from Yemen triggers air raid sirens near Jerusalem	Houthis launch second missile at Israel after pre-dawn strike; IDF reviewing details Air raid sirens sounded in the Jerusalem area Thursday evening following a missile launch from Yemen, marking the second such attack in less than a day. The IDF confirmed the launch and said the details were under review. Earlier Thursday, a pre-dawn missile attack from Yemen targeted multiple Israeli cities, including Tel Aviv and Rishon LeZion, before being intercepted by the Israeli Air Force. The Iran-backed Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for previous missile and drone attacks on Israel, framing them as retaliation for the war in Gaza. The U.S. has been conducting military operations against the Houthis in response to their attacks on regional shipping and Israeli targets.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy2uzrynyg	2025-03-20T09:36:08-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/20/r1kbzCK3yg/r1kbzCK3yg_1_108_640_361_0_small.jpg

U.S. urges Israel to hold fire after Houthi missile fire, officia...	Washington tells Jerusalem to let U.S. forces handle response, citing ongoing American military operations against Iran-backed group The United States has asked Israel not to retaliate after Yemen’s Houthi rebels launched a ballistic missile toward central Israel overnight, senior Israeli officials said Thursday. Washington urged Jerusalem to leave the response to American forces, which have been conducting military operations against the Iran-backed group, according to sources who spoke to Ynetnews. Israel is expected to comply with the U.S. request, refraining from airstrikes like those carried out in the past by the Israeli Air Force. Such operations are logistically complex due to the long distance between Israel and Yemen, requiring mid-air refueling. While past Israeli strikes have demonstrated the military’s reach and capabilities, the U.S. – which launched a special operation against the Houthis earlier this week – has greater capacity to conduct sustained attacks using aircraft stationed on its aircraft carriers. At around 4 am, a ballistic missile was launched from Yemen toward central Israel but was successfully intercepted by Israeli air defense systems before it could enter Israeli airspace. No injuries or damage were reported. Meanwhile, the United States has intensified its airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen in recent days. The strikes, aimed at securing maritime routes in the Red Sea, have targeted strategic rebel positions, including weapons depots, missile launch facilities, and command centers in the capital, Sanaa, and other areas. The latest attack on Israel came just hours after President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to the Houthis, vowing they would be 'completely annihilated' if they did not cease their missile strikes. 'Iran must stop sending these supplies IMMEDIATELY,' Trump wrote on Truth Social, directing his threat at the Houthis' main backer. 'Let the Houthis fight it out themselves. Either way, they lose—but this way, they lose quickly.' On Tuesday, three days after the U.S. airstrikes began, Houthi Foreign Minister Jamal Amer said the group was now effectively at war with the United States and warned of further escalation. In an interview with Reuters, Amer also threatened Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, cautioning them against intervention while praising their neutral stance so far. Meanwhile, Reuters cited two senior Iranian officials who said Tehran had twice urged the Houthis to de-escalate tensions, signaling concerns over the widening conflict. The U.S. military launched its operation over the weekend under orders from Trump after the Houthis vowed to resume attacks on Red Sea shipping linked to Israel, disrupting global trade routes. Since October 2023, these attacks—described by the Houthis as acts of solidarity with Gaza—have inflicted severe damage on global maritime trade, forcing vessels to reroute away from the Suez Canal and drastically raising insurance costs. > At the launch of the operation on Saturday, Trump warned the Houthis that 'hell will rain down' upon them and declared, 'Your time is up.' According to U.S. officials, several senior Houthi commanders have been killed since the strikes began. While the Pentagon initially signaled that the campaign could last for weeks, officials on Tuesday adopted a more cautious tone, stating that the U.S. is not seeking to overthrow the Houthi regime and that airstrikes will cease once the group commits to halting its attacks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skre6ttnjx	2025-03-20T09:26:31-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/20/S1WSiaFh1x/S1WSiaFh1x_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Trump administration budget slashing guts Jewish-American aid org...	Refugee aid group HIAS cuts 40% of staff and shuts offices worldwide after Trump administration funding cuts; crisis jeopardizes aid to vulnerable populations, operations in Israel and group's interfaith humanitarian work The longstanding Jewish-American aid organization HIAS, which also operates in Israel, announced extensive layoffs of approximately 40% of its workforce and the closure of international offices. This decision follows cuts to government foreign aid funding under the Trump administration. The world’s oldest refugee agency, employing nearly 2,000 people, stated that employees in its Israeli branch who worked with asylum seekers from Eritrea and South Sudan would be among those laid off. HIAS President Mark Hetfield described the situation as a 'death blow' to the refugee aid system and warned that 'the consequences will be felt within the Jewish community and in interfaith relations.' The funding cuts stem from sharp reductions in foreign aid under the Trump administration, specifically with huge slashes on USAID, which led to the termination of refugee program budgets in the U.S. and globally. Since Donald Trump assumed the presidency, government funding for aid agencies has been halted, resulting in the dismissal of hundreds of employees and the closure of HIAS’s international offices. Additionally, the administration canceled contracts with refugee resettlement organizations, which previously funded on-the-ground operations, leaving HIAS with financial obligations it could no longer meet. Due to the financial crisis, the organization has been forced to transition to a volunteer-based model. However, leadership warns that donations alone will not be sufficient to bridge the funding gap. In Israel, despite support primarily coming from private donations and the Jewish Agency, the crisis has compelled HIAS to reduce services for asylum seekers. At the organization’s Tel Aviv branch, there are concerns the cuts will significantly impact asylum seekers from Eritrea and South Sudan, exacerbating their economic vulnerability, which has worsened since the start of the Gaza war. HIAS Israel, which has been active since before the establishment of the state, runs a variety of aid programs, including legal assistance through volunteer lawyers, integration into the workforce, prevention of gender-based violence, and emergency aid. Additionally, the organization facilitates refugee resettlement in Canada through a program supported by the U.S. government in collaboration with a resettlement center in Austria. > Following the deadly Hamas terror attack on October 7, which displaced thousands of Israelis from their homes in the south and north of the country, HIAS established an emergency response system within 24 hours. The organization conducted a rapid needs assessment among displaced communities and has since provided essential supplies, financial aid, healthcare services, and psychological support, particularly to vulnerable populations lacking adequate government assistance. 140 years of supporting refugees HIAS was founded in 1881 in New York as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society to support Jews fleeing persecution and poverty in Eastern Europe. The organization’s founders were inspired by Jewish traditions and biblical texts, as well as the Jewish people’s history of oppression and diaspora. Over the years, HIAS has assisted millions of refugees, including Jews fleeing pogroms in Russia, Holocaust survivors, Vietnamese refugees, and migrants from Muslim-majority countries. While the organization previously focused on resettling Jews from the Soviet Union, in recent years, it has become a key player in aiding non-Jewish refugees. Today, HIAS operates in 22 countries across five continents, assisting refugees from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds. Its staff is also diverse in composition. In the global Jewish community, there is concern that the cessation of refugee aid will not only harm vulnerable populations but also damage the moral standing and reputation of the Jewish community, which has long regarded refugee assistance as a core value. This is particularly true in the United States, where fears have been raised about the impact on the Jewish community’s relationships with other minority groups. HIAS has played a central role in fostering interfaith and intercommunity partnerships. Senior officials within the organization warn that the consequences of the crisis will be felt for years to come, as HIAS faces the most significant challenge in its history. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj0jwqf3kx	2025-03-20T09:05:33-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2018/10/30/8852790/8852790_0_67_1300_732_0_small.jpg

I called out to my girls: ‘I will be back,’ but that was the las...	In a gut-wrenching speech before the UN, former Hamas hostage Eli Sharabi details the horrors of captivity and calls for justice; read his full speech My name is Eli Sharabi. I am 53 years old. I have come back from hell. I have returned to tell my story. I used to live in Kibbutz Be’eri with my British-born wife, Lianne, and my daughters, Noiya and Yahel. It was a beautiful community. We were all passionate about creating the best life for our children and for our neighbors. At 16, I left Tel Aviv for Be’eri, seeking a peaceful home away from the concrete city. I found a loving community and knew I would raise my family there. Many asked why we lived near Gaza – but to me, Be’eri was heaven. Lianne came from Bristol, UK, as a volunteer. She was meant to stay a few months but she met me, and we fell in love. We were married for 23 years and had two wonderful daughters and a dog, Mokka. On October 7, my heaven turned to hell. Sirens began, Hamas terrorists invaded and I was ripped away from my family, never to see them again. For 491 days, I was kept mostly underground in Hamas terror tunnels, chained, starved, beaten and humiliated. I was held captive in the darkness – isolated from the world – by Hamas terrorists. They took pleasure in our suffering. I survived on scraps of food, with no medical attention and no mercy. When I was released, I weighed just 44 kilos. I had lost over 30 kilos, nearly half my body weight. For 491 days, I held onto hope. I imagined the life we would rebuild. I dreamed of seeing my family again. Only when I returned home, I learned the truth. My wife and my daughters had been slaughtered by Hamas terrorists on October 7. I am here today, less than six weeks after my release, to speak for those still trapped in that nightmare. For my brother, Yossi, murdered in Hamas captivity, his body still held hostage. For Alon Ohel, still 50 meters underground. I swore to him that I would tell his story. For Hersh, Ori, Eden, Carmel, Almog and Alexander, murdered in cold blood by their captors. For every hostage still in Hamas’ hands. I am here to tell you the whole truth. On the morning of October 7, at 6:29 a.m., the red alerts began to come through on Lianne’s phone. I told her not to worry. 'It will be over soon,' I said. Minutes later, we heard that terrorists were infiltrating our community. They were inside the kibbutz. Again, I reassured her. 'The army will come, they always come.' We heard gunfire, screaming, explosions. And then, we heard the terrorists at our door. We had no weapons, no way to fight back. Lianne and I made a decision – we would not resist. We hoped we could save our daughters. The door opened. Our dog barked. The terrorists opened fire. Lianne and I threw ourselves over our daughters, screaming for the terrorists to stop. Suddenly, ten terrorists were inside my home. They took our phones. Two of them grabbed me. They took my wife and daughters to the kitchen. I couldn’t see them anymore. I didn’t know what was happening to them. I was screaming their names, and they were screaming mine. I told Lianne not to be afraid. But this was fear beyond anything I have ever felt. Then I knew I was being taken. As they dragged me out, I called out to my girls: 'I will be back.' I had to believe that. But that was the last time I ever saw them. I did not know I should have said goodbye, forever. Outside was like a warzone. My peaceful home—my slice of heaven—was gone. I saw over a hundred terrorists filming themselves celebrating, laughing, partying in our gardens as they massacred my friends and neighbors. They dragged me to the border, beating me the whole way. My face was swollen, my ribs bruised. When we arrived in Gaza, a mob of civilians tried to lynch me. They pulled me from the car, but the terrorists rushed me away into a mosque. I was their trophy. I thought about Lianne, Noiya and Yahel. Were they still alive? For the first 52 days, I was held in an apartment. I was tied up with ropes. My arms and legs were tied so tightly the ropes tore into my flesh. I was given almost no food, no water, and I couldn’t sleep. The pain was unbearable. Sometimes, I would just faint from the pain, only to wake up to that pain again and again. Then, on November 27, 2023, Hamas took me into a tunnel. Fifty meters underground. Again, the chains were so tight they ripped my skin. They never took them off. Not for a single moment. Those chains tore at me until the day I was released. Every step I took was no more than ten centimeters. Every walk to the bathroom took an eternity. I cannot begin to describe the agony. It was hell. I was fed a piece of pita a day. Maybe a sip of tea. Hunger consumed everything. They beat me. They broke my ribs. I didn’t care. I just wanted a piece of bread. There was never enough food. Sometimes, if we begged enough, we would get something extra. We had to choose: an extra piece of pita or a cup of tea. Sometimes, they threw us dry dates, and it felt like the greatest gift in the world. We had to beg for food, beg to use the bathroom. Begging was our existence. We strategized over every meal. One day, I cut myself with a razor, just to make them believe I was injured. I collapsed on my way to the bathroom so they would think I was too weak and encourage them to give us more food. It worked. They gave us more food. We survived off those small victories. Do you know what it means to open a refrigerator? It is everything. To be able to reach and take a piece of fruit, an egg, a piece of bread. I dreamt of this simple act every day. For months, we lived like this. I stopped counting the days. Living as a hostage, you don’t know how the day will begin, nor how it will end. Whether you will live or die. At any moment, they could beat you. At any moment, they could kill you. You wake up every day and do not know when you will be able to eat. It could be 12 p.m., 5 p.m., 11 p.m. This would be the only meal we would have. You hope and pray that there will be no surprises with the captors. You think about how desperately you want to shower. We only got one bath a month, with half a bucket of cold water. Toothpaste? Toilet paper? Forget it. Psychological terror was constant. Every day, they told us: 'The world has abandoned you. No one is coming.' By the time I met Alon Ohel, who is now 24 years old, we had already endured terrible captivity. We relied on each other for survival. Alon is a very talented pianist and I remember how he would pretend to play the piano on his body to keep himself sane. One day, a terrorist took his anger out on me. He stormed in and beat me so badly that he broke my ribs. I couldn’t properly breathe for a month. Alon tried to protect me with his own body. You couldn’t believe how lucky I felt when Alon told me he had saved one painkiller pill. He gave it to me to get through the night. Alon still has shrapnel in his right eye from the day he was kidnapped. He never received medical care. He never saw the Red Cross. To this day, he is blind in that eye. When I was released, he grabbed onto me, terrified to be left behind. He told me he was happy for me. I promised him it was just a matter of days before he would be home too. I was wrong. Just before my release, Hamas took pleasure in showing me a picture of my brother, Yossi. They told me he was dead. It was like they had brought a massive hammer down on me. I refused to believe it. My brother Yossi was all heart. Those with him in captivity told me that he gave his food to others. On February 8, 2025, I was released. I weighed 44 kilograms. This is less than the body weight of my youngest daughter, Yahel, may her memory be a blessing. I was a shell of my former self. I still am. I could not believe how I looked. I stood at that sick Hamas ceremony, surrounded by terrorists and a crowd of so-called uninvolved civilians, hoping my wife and daughters were waiting for me. At the handover, I met a representative from the Red Cross. She told me, 'Don’t worry, you are safe now.' Safe? How could I feel safe surrounded by terrorist monsters? Where had the Red Cross been for the past 491 days? Then I arrived home. They told me my mother and sister were waiting for me. I said, 'Get me my wife and daughters.' And that was when I knew. They were gone. They had been murdered. I am here today because I survived and I prevailed. But that is not enough. Not when Alon Ohel is still there. Not when 59 hostages are still there. Right now, Alon is trapped underground, alone, surrounded by terrorists who torment him. He does not know if he will ever see his mother, father, his entire beloved family again. I will not leave him behind. I will not leave anyone behind. Their time has almost run out. I am here before you now to give my testimony. And to ask: Where was the United Nations? Where was the Red Cross? Where was the world? > I know that you discuss the humanitarian situation in Gaza very often. But let me tell you, as an eyewitness—I saw what happened to that aid. Hamas STOLE it. I saw Hamas terrorists carrying boxes with the UN and UNRWA emblems on them into the tunnel. Dozens and dozens of boxes, paid by your governments, feeding terrorists who tortured me and murdered my family. They would eat many meals a day from the UN aid in front of us, and we never received any of it. When you speak of humanitarian aid, remember this: Hamas eats like kings while hostages starve. Hamas steals from civilians. Hamas blocks aid from reaching those who truly need it. 491 days. That is how long I starved, how long I was chained, how long I begged for my humanity. And in all that time, no one came. And no one in Gaza helped me. No one. The civilians in Gaza saw us suffering. They cheered our kidnappers. They were definitely involved. I was freed less than six weeks ago. I met President Trump at the White House and thanked him for securing my release and many others. I appreciate his efforts to free those still held hostage by Hamas. I told him: BRING THEM ALL HOME. I met with Prime Minister Starmer at 10 Downing Street. I told him: BRING THEM ALL HOME. Now, I am here before you at the United Nations to say: BRING THEM ALL HOME. No more excuses. No more delays. If you stand for humanity – prove it. Bring them home. My name is Eli Sharabi. I am not a diplomat. I am a survivor. BRING THEM ALL HOME. NOW. Thank you. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkacjhth1e	2025-03-20T07:45:54-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/20/HkQUiRjYnJe/HkQUiRjYnJe_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

IDF kills senior Hamas, Islamic Jihad operatives as Gaza fighting...	Military carries out precision airstrikes targeting key terror figures in enclave as part of ongoing operations; families of captives urge officials to prioritize their release, warning that intensified action could put them at risk The Israeli military announced Thursday it had killed several senior Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad operatives in targeted airstrikes in Gaza, as fighting between Israel and terror factions continued to intensify. Meanwhile, the families of hostages held in Gaza urged military officials to prioritize their rescue, warning that increased military pressure could put their loved ones at greater risk. Israeli airstrikes overnight killed Ayman Atsalikh, the head of Hamas’ General Security apparatus in Khan Younis, and Rashid Jahjouh, who led the organization’s General Security unit in Gaza, the military said. In a separate strike, Israeli forces also eliminated Ismail Abd al-Aal, a key operative in Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s weapons smuggling network. The IDF and the Shin Bet security agency confirmed that Jahjouh had taken over Hamas’ General Security unit after Sami Ouda was killed by Israeli forces in July 2024 alongside Ruhi Mushtaha, Hamas’ top political leader in Gaza. According to the military, Hamas’ General Security apparatus is one of the organization’s most secretive and influential bodies, tasked with identifying suspected collaborators, protecting senior Hamas figures and assets both in Gaza and abroad, and suppressing opposition to the group’s rule. As Israeli military operations intensified, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum issued a statement warning that expanded ground operations and airstrikes could endanger the captives held by Hamas. 'We must return to a ceasefire and a deal that ensures the immediate release of all hostages in one stage—there is no other way,' the group said. 'Gambling with their lives is an irreversible moral stain.' Addressing IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir and other senior commanders, the families stressed, 'You have a moral duty to rescue the hostages. Some are IDF soldiers who were abducted while serving under your command.' Before announcing the targeted killings, the IDF warned residents of Bani Suheila, a suburb of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, to evacuate immediately. Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, the IDF’s Arabic-language spokesperson, said the warning was issued after terror groups launched rockets from civilian areas. 'We have issued multiple warnings. For your safety, you must immediately move westward to humanitarian zones,' Adraee said in a statement. The evacuation order came after earlier in the day, air raid sirens sounded across central Israel as rockets were fired from Gaza for the first time in months. Hamas claimed responsibility, saying it had launched a barrage of M90 mid-range rockets 'in response to the Zionist massacres of civilians.' The last time rockets from Gaza triggered alarms in central Israel was on October 7, 2024, marking the anniversary of Hamas’s deadly attack on Israeli border communities. In Rishon LeZion, shrapnel landed in four locations across the city, though no injuries or property damage were reported. Security teams were dispatched to assess the situation. > According to the IDF, one rocket was intercepted by the Israeli Air Force, while two others landed in open areas. Sirens were heard in Tel Aviv, Holon, Ramat Gan, Or Yehuda, and other cities across the Gush Dan region. The rocket fire coincided with Israel’s renewed ground operations in northern Gaza, where two battalion combat teams, backed by the 188th Armored Brigade, took positions in Beit Lahia. Overnight, Israeli airstrikes targeted around 40 underground Hamas sites, terror operatives, and weapons facilities, the military said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkqcx3th1l	2025-03-20T07:33:39-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/20/ByUB1100Y3Jl/ByUB1100Y3Jl_1_63_1601_901_0_small.jpg

Former Shin Bet head Argaman investigated by police for alleged t...	Investigation comes following complaint filed by PM directly to police commissioner, made after TV interview in which Argaman suggested he might reveal private talks if he felt Netanyahu was acting illegally Former Shin Bet Director Nadav Argaman was questioned by police on Thursday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu filed a complaint against him over remarks made in an interview, in which Argaman suggested he might disclose details from private meetings with Netanyahu if he believed the prime minister was acting illegally. Argaman was questioned at the central fraud investigation unit on suspicion of extortion by threats. Last Friday, Netanyahu submitted what he described as an 'urgent complaint' against Argaman, calling for an investigation following his comments on Channel 12 News. In a letter sent directly to Police Commissioner Daniel Levy—rather than through the standard police complaint process—Netanyahu wrote that an inquiry was necessary as 'all red lines had been crossed.' Argaman’s remarks were made in the context of ongoing efforts to revive the government’s judicial overhaul plan and allegations related to 'Qatar-Gate,' a controversy involving claims of foreign influence in Israeli policymaking. He stated that while he had withheld certain information out of respect for the confidentiality between a Shin Bet chief and a prime minister, he would not hesitate to speak out if he believed Netanyahu was violating the law. 'For now, everything that happened in one-on-one meetings between the prime minister and me—I keep in that space,' Argaman said. 'It is absolutely clear that I have a great deal of knowledge, and I could use it, but I am not, for the reasons I mentioned. If I reach the conclusion that the prime minister is acting illegally, I will have no choice but to disclose everything I know and have kept to myself until now.' Before submitting his complaint, Netanyahu publicly responded to Argaman’s comments, also accusing current Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar of 'extortion by threats.' > 'A dangerous new red line has been crossed in Israeli democracy,' Netanyahu said. 'Never, in all of Israel’s history or in the history of democracies, has a former head of a secret security agency openly blackmailed a sitting prime minister on live television. This crime is part of an ongoing campaign of extortion through media leaks in recent days, orchestrated by current Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar.' In response, the Shin Bet dismissed Netanyahu’s accusations against Bar, calling them baseless. 'This is a serious allegation against the head of a national security agency in Israel,' the agency said in a statement. 'Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar is fully dedicated to security matters, the efforts to bring back hostages, and the protection of democracy. Any claim to the contrary is entirely unfounded.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkderjy21x	2025-03-20T06:36:27-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/03/07/r1mVIfvpp/r1mVIfvpp_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Taliban releases American held for over 2 years, State Department...	George Glezmann, an airline mechanic from Atlanta, was seized by Taliban’s intelligence services in December 2022; he is the third US detainee released since January An American man who was abducted more than two years ago while traveling through Afghanistan as a tourist has been released by the Taliban in a deal brokered by U.S. and Qatari negotiators, the State Department said Thursday. George Glezmann, an airline mechanic from Atlanta, is the third American detainee to be released by the Taliban since January. He was seized by the Taliban’s intelligence services in December 2022 and was designated by the U.S. government as wrongfully detained the following year. He was being accompanied back to the U.S., through Qatar’s capital, Doha, by Adam Boehler, who has been handling hostage issues for President Donald Trump’s administration. Qatar has hosted negotiations between the U.S. and the Taliban over the years. The release of Glezmann is part of what the Taliban has previously described as the 'normalization' of ties between the U.S. and Afghanistan following the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. Most countries still don’t recognize the Taliban’s rule. Glezmann’s release follows a separate deal, arranged in the final days of the Biden administration and also mediated by the Qataris, that secured the releases of Ryan Corbett and William McKenty. The Taliban’s Foreign Ministry in Kabul said at the time that those two U.S. citizens had been exchanged for Khan Mohammed, who was sentenced to two life terms in 2008 after being convicted under U.S. narco-terrorism laws. Unlike in that arrangement, the U.S. did not give up any prisoner to secure Glezmann’s release, which was seen as a goodwill gesture, according to an official briefed on the matter who insisted on anonymity due to the sensitivity of the negotiations. > The Taliban disclosed earlier Thursday that Boehler had been meeting on hostage issues with a delegation that included Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi. President Joe Biden contemplated before he left office an earlier proposal that would have involved the release of Glezmann and other Americans for Muhammad Rahim, one of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. But Biden told families during a call in January that he would not support trading Rahim unless the Taliban released Afghan-American businessman Mahmood Habibi. U.S. officials believe the Taliban is holding Habibi, but the Taliban has denied it. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rknpmifn1g	2025-03-20T06:22:52-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/08/15/r18mACd2n/r18mACd2n_0_204_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

In response, Netanyahu submitted an 'urgent complaint' to Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai, requesting an investigation into Argaman’s remarks.

Sharabi, 53, held hostage by Hamas for 491 days, questions international organizations' inaction ahead of speech: 'Where was the Red Cross? Where was the UN?' Eli Sharabi, 53, who was held hostage by Hamas in Gaza for 491 days before being released in the most recent hostage deal, is set to address the United Nations Security Council on Thursday. 'I’ve come back from hell,' Sharabi said ahead of his speech. 'Where was the Red Cross? Where was the UN?' He described his abduction from Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7, 2023, when Hamas terrorists stormed his home, murdered his wife and daughters and dragged him to Gaza. Held underground, starved and chained, he lost over 30 kilograms during his captivity. 'I was treated worse than an animal,' he recalled, saying he was given little food or water and was routinely beaten and humiliated. Sharabi’s brother, Yossi, was also taken hostage but later died in captivity. His body remains in Gaza. 'Hamas took pleasure in showing me his picture,' he said. 'It was like a hammer crushing me.' > Sharabi, recently freed in a hostage deal, has since met with world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, calling for the release of the remaining 59 hostages. 'No more excuses, no more moral blindness,' he said. 'You cannot claim to stand for humanity and abandon those still in hell.' Sharabi’s testimony is expected to shed light on the conditions endured by Israeli hostages in Gaza and raise concerns over the lack of access provided to humanitarian organizations. His address comes as international pressure mounts for the release of remaining hostages and scrutiny over the response of global bodies to their plight. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry7qj9tnke	2025-03-20T05:52:02-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/20/HJ9eqqK2Jl/HJ9eqqK2Jl_0_0_1280_714_0_small.jpg

Israeli-Arab man arrested, charged with plotting terror attacks a...	Shin Bet and police arrested Jihad Zariqat, an Israeli-Arab, for planning a ramming attack against soldiers, alongside other suspects linked to ISIS and Hamas; Investigations revealed growing terrorist affiliations, incitement and attempts to carry out attacks fueled by extremist ideology Shin Bet and the police announced on Thursday that they arrested Jihad Zariqat, a resident of Kafr Kana, last month on suspicion of committing security offenses. During his arrest, they found wills he had written, various Hamas publications teaching how to carry out attacks, and other nationalist materials in his possession. A Shin Bet and police investigation revealed Zariqat had planned to carry out a vehicular ramming attack against IDF troops and even attempted to execute his plan. An indictment was filed against him on Thursday. According to the indictment, during 2022, Zariqat adopted an ideology in line with Hamas doctrine, viewing Jews as 'infidels' deserving death and Israel as a foreign, occupying entity. He consumed content related to jihad and martyrdom and decided to carry out an attack targeting security forces near the Al-Aqsa Mosque. As part of his preparations, Zariqat drafted a will on his cellphone between April 2022 and October 2023, in which he wrote that one must 'die for Allah' as part of a war against the State of Israel and its citizens. The will included quotes from the spokesperson of Hamas' Al-Qassam Brigades. Additionally, the defendant purchased writings by Hamas terrorists that encouraged attacks and watched tutorials on how to manufacture explosive devices. The indictment also noted that, following October 7, Zariqat's desire to die a 'martyr's death' as part of a terrorist attack increased. In January 2024, he drafted another handwritten will, calling for jihad and referring to himself as a 'living martyr.' According to a second charge in the indictment, in April 2024, Zariqat attempted to carry out a vehicular ramming attack against IDF soldiers near the Golani Junction in northern Israel, west of the Sea of Galilee. > He believed that among the soldiers waiting at the bus stop was a young man from his village who had enlisted in the IDF and whom he considered a 'traitor.' Zariqat accelerated his car toward the bus stop intending to hit the soldiers, but another vehicle passing by blocked his path, preventing him from completing the attack. Last week, police and Shin Bet arrested Kamel Nashaf, a 21-year-old resident of Tayibe, on suspicion of pledging allegiance to ISIS, making contact with operatives affiliated with the organization, and deciding to exact retribution for the war in Gaza by assisting terrorist organizations in the West Bank. Police investigations revealed that Nashaf filmed security forces en route to Tulkarm and transmitted the information via Telegram to operatives in the area to prepare for the forces' arrival. An indictment against him will be filed on Thursday. The investigation revealed that Nashaf began consuming ISIS-related terrorist content on social media during the summer of last year and even made contact with operatives affiliated with the organization. He pledged allegiance to ISIS, considered himself a member, and possessed materials tied to the organization, which were seized during his arrest. About two weeks ago, the prosecution sought to impose a minimum nine-month prison sentence on 24-year-old student Miryam Abu Quider, who posted messages of praise and support for terrorist organizations on Instagram. She continued her activities despite being warned by Shin Bet that her posts constituted incitement. Abu Quider was convicted in March 2024 of identifying with a terrorist organization as part of a plea deal. She had been arrested three years earlier during a protest at Ben-Gurion University, where she had previously studied. In mid-February, police and Shin Bet announced they had successfully foiled a vehicular ramming and shooting attack planned by two Arab-Israeli citizens targeting security forces. The two, Rateb Omar, 18, and Omri Musa, 22, from the town of Zemer, were charged in the Lod District Court with conspiracy to commit aggravated murder. Additionally, each was charged, according to their roles, with preparing for acts of terrorism, training for terrorist purposes, and using weapons for terrorist purposes. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkrstdk2ke	2025-03-20T04:43:30-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/20/HJbw7yOFn1e/HJbw7yOFn1e_0_24_505_284_0_small.jpg
Genocide supporter': Berlin journalist faces threats for defying...	British journalist Nicholas Potter, known for exposing Kremlin propaganda and criticizing antisemitism, is facing violent harassment in Berlin after rejecting claims of 'genocide' in Gaza and reporting on radical left-wing ties to Russian and Iranian disinformation campaigns British journalist Nicholas Potter, a writer for the German daily Die Tageszeitung, published an article on March 9 opposing the characterization of the war in Gaza as 'genocide.' The piece incited outrage among the newspaper’s readership, most of whom align with the left-wing of German politics and harbor considerable hostility toward Israel alongside strong sympathy for Palestinians. The article garnered so much hatred and vitriol, that it had its comment section closed shortly after publication. Two days later, the newspaper’s editors issued a statement condemning the violent harassment directed at Potter — both online and on the streets of Berlin — and expressing their support for him. Potter, who primarily writes about antisemitism, racism and the rise of the far-right, has faced escalating attacks. In their statement, editors specifically referenced Israel’s war in Gaza and its coverage in the media. However, the seeds of the 'intifada' against Potter — who has written for outlets such as The New York Times and Haaretz and co-authored a book with Stephan Laufer on antisemitism in countercultures — were sown months prior when he published an investigative piece on a different topic: portals disseminating anti-Western propaganda funded by Russia. In mid-October, Potter published a report on a Berlin-based portal called 'Red,' which has been rapidly gaining traction. The site, which identifies with resistance movements and aligns with the left, has been anti-Israel from its inception—a stance that intensified following the October 7 massacre. According to Potter, the site and its writers published materials from violent pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses, often from locations inaccessible to other media outlets. When Greta Thunberg arrived in Berlin on the anniversary of the terror attack to join protests under the slogan 'Glory to Resistance,' she gave an interview to the portal, which garnered 360,000 views on the X platform. The portal also conducted interviews with Hezbollah and Houthi terrorists, some of whom marked the anniversary of the massacre by discussing 'breaking out of the Gaza prison.' Potter’s investigation revealed that 'Red' is part of the Kremlin’s propaganda apparatus, a successor to 'Redfish,' which was shut down after its ties to Moscow were uncovered. The portal’s aim, Potter noted, is to destabilize the West by spreading disinformation. He also found that the Berlin-based portal was registered under shell companies in Istanbul, likely to evade sanctions against Russia. In response to the investigation, 'Red' issued a statement, concluding with the declaration: 'Palestine will be free — from the river to the sea.' In December, Potter published an article in the Jerusalem Post on 'Red' and other far-left sites that benefit from Russian or Iranian support and frequently publish anti-Israel content, including antisemitic conspiracy theories. 'I’ve been a target of pro-Palestinian activists for years now, both online and in real life,' Potter told Ynet. 'These attacks go far beyond legitimate criticism of a journalist. They include defamation, insults and threats. My book about antisemitism in progressive countercultures was published a month before October 7. Some of the readings and discussions about it, which I held alongside my co-author, were disrupted by protesters and required police protection.' In mid-December, 'Red' launched a smear campaign against Potter, labeling him a 'genocide supporter, Zionist, and part of the pro-Israel propaganda machine.' The portal also highlighted Potter’s participation in a journalist fellowship in Jerusalem sponsored by the Jerusalem Post, framing it as proof that he was a 'recruited' journalist. (Potter stayed in Israel from November to February and was part of the Jerusalem Post’s international journalist program in December and January.) This campaign, coupled with the fact that Potter, a left-leaning journalist, criticized parts of the left and the antisemitism it masks, quickly turned him from an online target into a real-life one. Stickers featuring his image and the caption 'German son of a bitch' were plastered across many public places in Berlin, and in extreme cases, even death threats were made against him. 'Since December, the attacks have become much more intense after I published the investigation into 'Red,' its support for Palestinian terror groups, its murky financial sources, and its ties to Russian propaganda,' Potter explained. 'Many pro-Palestinian activists amplified the campaign, claiming that I’m so good at 'genocide propaganda' that even Israel hired me, when the truth is that I stayed there in January-February as part of an international journalist exchange program. Shortly afterward, the stickers started appearing.' 'I write very critically about Netanyahu, his attacks on the judiciary and the media, his right-wing coalition, and the heavy-handedness in Gaza,' he added, 'but I oppose calling the war 'genocide,' as I believe such terminology stems from antisemitism. I also write extensively about the rise of antisemitism since October 7.' According to the German Journalists' Association, there were 118 recorded attacks on journalists at protests in the past year, 66 of them at pro-Palestinian demonstrations in Germany. Reporters Without Borders states that such demonstrations have surpassed right-wing protests in terms of violent incidents and assaults against journalists. This month, two Jewish journalists and two others were attacked — one of them had hot tea poured on his head — during an anti-Israel protest in Berlin. In January, a television reporter was assaulted at an anti-Israel protest in Leipzig, sustaining a head injury that required hospitalization. Earlier, in July, two pro-Palestinian protesters followed an Iranian journalist in Berlin to his home and threatened him with a knife. This is just a small sample of the violence from the radical pro-Palestinian left against anything perceived as pro-Israel or Jewish, regardless of reality. Berlin, supposedly a bastion of liberalism and diverse opinions, has become a hub for toxic incitement, hate campaigns and slander against journalists. 'This is shameful and unacceptable,' Potter stated. 'This is an attack, mainly by anti-Israel campaigners, on press freedom and democracy itself. We must not allow radical activists to intimidate journalists through defamation, threats, and even physical violence. Until now, these were things I had only witnessed from the far-right or antisemitic conspiracy groups. The left is becoming increasingly authoritarian. They not only support Islamic terror groups like Hamas but also attack the pillars of democracy and are willing to collaborate with propaganda outlets funded by Russia, Qatar, or Turkey to achieve their goals.' > 'The case of Nicholas Potter serves as a warning that radical groups are attempting to undermine the press,' the Central Council of Jews in Germany stated. 'We know Nicholas Potter as a courageous journalist who is only interested in uncovering the truth. Anyone who threatens or slanders him cannot argue with him. As a society, we must not allow this.' 'I have no problem with objective criticism,' Potter said, 'but this campaign deeply concerns me. It brands me as an enemy against whom all means are justified. When an incitement campaign starts, it only takes one person to decide to act on it. While many people support me in countering this campaign, there are quite a few activists, especially from the aggressive anti-Israel and anti-imperialism factions, who try to justify these attacks and make them seem legitimate.' Many journalists in Germany have decided to stop covering pro-Palestinian demonstrations out of fear of retaliation and being labeled as enemies. Lists of 'enemy' journalists are circulating in Berlin. This marks the beginning of an anti-democratic and antisemitic spiral disguised as liberal democracy. On Tuesday, Potter published an article in Die Tageszeitung titled 'Intifada Against the Media.' One of his critics was an Israeli affiliated with the German left. 'I thought about taking a break from writing about antisemitism and Israel,' said Potter, 'but I think that sends a dangerous message. I won’t let them threaten me or press freedom. But, of course, it affects my private life when you see colleagues attacked or hear that there’s a list with names and addresses of journalists the activists dislike.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1aa118y31g	2025-03-20T04:36:17-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/20/HJxwv4QF2kl/HJxwv4QF2kl_0_369_590_332_0_small.jpg

Despite war and strife, Israel ranks 8th in World Happiness index	Israel ranks 8th in life satisfaction in the 2025 UN World Happiness Report; While Israelis excel in social support and relationships, they struggle with public trust and rising negative emotions following a year of internal and external turmoil The 2025 UN World Happiness Report, published on Thursday, presents a complex picture regarding Israel: on one hand, the unique strengths of Israeli society are reflected in social cohesion, the quality of relationships, and the high level of support. On the other hand, there has been significant erosion in public trust in state institutions and an increase in the negative emotions experienced by the citizens. And yet, when diving into the database, it reveals that Israel, even in one of the most difficult years in its history, again breaks all statistics and defies logic as it is ranked 8th in the world in the life satisfaction index. How is this possible? Dr. Anat Fanti, a researcher of happiness policy in the Science, Technology and Society program at Bar-Ilan University, has an educated and reasoned explanation for why, even this year, despite the well-known personal and national hell endured within an endless internal and external war, Israel still ranked in the top 10. The results of the 2025 report are based on the average sample from 2022 to 2024. This means there are nearly two full years between 2022 and October 2023 in which there was no war (although there was judicial overhaul nationwide protests), and these years protect Israel’s ranking and explain — beyond the fact that it is truly an incorrigibly optimistic nation — how Israel reached such a high ranking in a three-year sample, two of which were during a state of war. 'This index measures life satisfaction and reflects structural social stability, but it does not measure our emotions,' says Fanti. 'Emotions are measured separately, and we will address them shortly, but the index itself is explained by six parameters: GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity and perception of corruption.' In which parameters did we decline this year compared to last year, a decline that brought us from 5th place to 8th?| 'This year, we declined in life expectancy because, unfortunately, many Israelis were murdered or killed in battle. We also declined in freedom to make life choices and significantly in the ability to trust government institutions.' And where did we improve? 'In social support and the quality of social relationships, and in generosity, which is measured by the percentage of donations to charity. GDP per capita remained fairly similar to last year’s measurement and contributes to the stability of the index. When looking at these parameters, it becomes clear why we achieved 5th place in social support among 147 countries. This is further echoed by the index measuring the number of social relationships and their quality, which was examined among young people in all countries. Israel is ranked 7th in the world in the number of social connections and 1st in the world in the quality of social connections.' The implication, says Fanti, mainly indicates the resilience of Israeli society, 'because we feel greater confidence in our ability to rely on those around us during crises, which is a critical advantage during war, distress and crises.' Fanti recalls that in last year’s index, which was based on 2021 to 2023, young people in Israel ranked 2nd overall globally in life satisfaction. 'If it weren’t for the war, we would have ranked 1st in life satisfaction among young people in Israel,' she estimates. And the war only underscored this, of course. 'Exactly. The question that was asked to answer this section was: ‘When you are in distress, do you have someone to turn to?’ And we all know that, in Israel, there is always someone to turn to, especially in distress. We are the best at providing support during crises, and this year reflects that exactly. And generally speaking, it’s unheard of in Israel not to have someone to turn to. This is the core of Israeli existence, and therefore it doesn’t surprise me that we are ranked 5th globally in social support, which is one of the six parameters that explain our high ranking. Nor does it surprise me that we are ranked 1st this year in the quality of social connections. This is how I interpret the results Israel achieved.' Fanti also adds that her colleagues worldwide continue to tell her that Israel is a crazy place that their model fails to fully explain. The World Happiness Index is based on life satisfaction, which is a stable measure reflecting structural characteristics such as economic strength, the level of social engagement, and the quality of health care services. How do the effects of the war show up in the emotional indices? 'Out of 147 countries, we are ranked 120th in the positive emotions index, an improvement of three places from last year. But in the negative emotions index, we climbed from 60th place to 50th, which reflects that the last year was filled with the three emotions measured — worry, sadness and anger. In other words, over the past year, our level of negative emotions has risen significantly. We jumped 10 places in the amount of negative emotions. This is not an easy statistic. While we are not ranked 1st in negative emotions, we are on an upward trend in recent years. In the 2023 report (based on 2020–2022), we were ranked 119th. Last year, the war raised us to 60th due to the direct impact of October 7, and this year, we climbed to 50th.' So, alongside being ranked 8th in overall life satisfaction, we are simultaneously ranked 50th in the world in the negative emotions index? 'Yes. While the overall index, as we said, is not an emotional index but one that evaluates life in general, when we look at the emotional index, it definitely reflects the current year of war and what we felt in it —worry, sadness, and anger.' Fanti adds that, beyond the characteristics examined in the report, the stability of Israel’s ranking can be attributed to the strengths of the Israeli people, such as family values, faith, social connections and the ability to cope with trauma — characteristics specific to Israel that protects its population even in the most difficult circumstances. > A particularly worrying picture emerging from the report is the sharp decline in public trust in government institutions, as reflected in the corruption perception index, where Israel dropped 30 places — from 80th in 2021 to 109th this year in the level of trust the public has in government institutions. This point also echoes the results of the 2023 Social Survey in Israel, which showed a dramatic plunge in trust levels, particularly among the secular population, to an unprecedented low. 'Policymakers must work to preserve the unique strengths of the Israeli population and rebuild public trust, to ensure that life satisfaction in Israel continues to be among the highest in the world and that our negative emotions decrease to a much lower level that does not harm our mental and physical health,' says Fanti. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1xdfvt31g	2025-03-20T01:22:47-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/04/27/r1TEgF9bR/r1TEgF9bR_1_62_1000_563_0_small.jpg

People simply aren’t showing up': IDF struggles to fill reserve ...	The ultra-Orthodox are not enlisting and the ground war in Gaza has resumed, as the burden on reservists is increasing and the percentage of reservist enlistments is falling; Reserve officers and commanders report a 30% drop in the total number of soldiers: 'You can’t blame them. They’ve left everything behind and have been fighting for 300 days, sometimes more'; The IDF is looking for solutions, but the problem remains: there is not enough manpower. Lt. Col. T., a senior officer in an IDF armored reserve brigade, is preparing to enter Gaza for a third tour in two weeks. But despite the renewed fighting, he says he is struggling to fill the ranks. 'There’s a significant challenge in recruiting reservists. You can feel it with every call you make. It’s not what it was a year ago,' he told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth. 'Reservists understand that, at least for now, this draft is mainly for guard duty, not for intensive combat, and they’re saying: ‘I was drafted, I gave up things — at least let me fight, do something active.’ Right now, it looks like defensive tasks, and people simply aren’t showing up,' he explained. According to Lt. Col. T., his brigade is facing a 30% decrease in manpower. 'With a full roster, I need 15 officers to allow for normal rotation. Right now, two weeks before deployment, I barely have five. If I can’t get another five, it’s a major problem,' he explained. 'We have entire companies off the roster because they lack both a company commander and deputy — there are only two platoon leaders left. If I can’t bring in more people, I’ll go with fewer. My concern is that those who do come will be overworked, and after a while they’ll say they can’t go on and leave. This is a serious problem that people need to address.' Lt. Col. T. isn’t alone. Other officers are sounding the alarm over the growing difficulty of recruiting combat soldiers and staff for upcoming deployments, warning that the issue demands urgent attention. 'There are the usual reasons,' said Lt. Col. T. 'Some say their semester is more important now because they’re behind in studies or work, others have serious personal matters. I have one officer with a three-month-old baby he’s barely seen, another who recently got divorced and shares custody. This touches everyone. There’s a drop in manpower, and we’re having a hard time recruiting after nearly a year and a half of intense activity. We need more people.' Officers reported that reserve recruitment rates of 50% to 70% are now the exception, with the burden falling on fewer and fewer soldiers. 'Normally, my calls to reservists end quickly,' described Lt. Col. A., another officer struggling to recruit. 'As soon as they hear it’s me, they explain they can’t do it anymore. I’ve ended up calling people who’ve been exempt for years. It’s like pulling from the reserves of the reserves.' He added, 'Everyone wants to contribute, that’s clear, but people’s lives have been on hold for too long, and they’re struggling.' A battalion commander who served in Gaza during the past two deployments and recently in the West Bank described a similar challenge. 'There’s real distress; it’s not easy to fight for this long,' he said. 'The motivation is high, but it’s a very complex situation. You can see the drop in recruitment rates from one rotation to the next. And these are good people—you can’t blame them. They’ve left everything behind and have been fighting for 300 days, sometimes more.' Turning Reservists into Contractors? The pressures on reservists and the low turnout rates have forced the IDF to take extraordinary steps, offering financial incentives to encourage reservists to show up. Combat reservists are being called up for a month-long deployment stretched artificially over two months in a 'week-on, week-off' format. This system, previously reserved for rear positions like cooks, drivers, and base guards, allows reservists to spend one week in service and the next at home on full IDF pay. While this approach eases the burden on soldiers’ personal lives, it places a heavier financial strain on the government, costing tens of millions of additional shekels each quarter. It also aligns with other financial benefits the government is offering to reservists to encourage participation. Some officers argue that this shift undermines the IDF’s 'people’s army' model, replacing values like volunteerism, Zionism and pride with financial motivations that, in practice, are turning the military into a professional army in the second year of war. 'It’s good that the state is helping reservists financially, including the additional 3 billion shekels from the Finance Ministry,' said a field unit commander. 'But this makes sense for a few months of war. Now that it’s dragging into a second year, we’re seeing most IDF fighters effectively becoming salaried employees.' He noted the rise in 'attached reservists,' typically young people aged 22–23 who haven’t found stable civilian jobs and choose to serve in the reserves because of the financial benefits. 'These young guys inflate the IDF’s reported turnout rates to 80%–85%, which is misleading,' he said. 'They’re great soldiers, but they’re usually assigned to less critical defensive tasks, and with the renewed fighting, commanders will struggle to use them in offensive operations because they’re unfamiliar with the regular units.' > Some units have even created entire sections and companies of attached reservists. Commanders are increasingly lenient when soldiers request not to report for duty. 'How can a battalion commander, in good conscience, punish a reservist who’s already served nearly a year in Gaza, Lebanon or the West Bank, risked his life, but now can’t come because of family crises, academic delays from prolonged absence, emotional exhaustion, or a collapsing business?' he asked. The IDF said it is working hard to improve the efficiency of its reserve system, focusing on increasing and maximizing the standing army. Officials emphasized that the performance of reservists and the entire reserve force during the war has been exceptional, with impressive turnout since October 7. 'The IDF greatly values their contribution and sees them as a central component of its combat capability,' the statement read. 'Significant efforts are being made to honor and reward reservists and their families.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj6lvsthke	2025-03-19T23:48:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/19/yk14303002/yk14303002_0_122_1256_707_0_small.jpg

Growing up in Shachar’s light ': Jerusalem kindergarten renamed ...	Jerusalem’s Rassco kindergarten renamed for former pupil Staff Sgt. Shachar Fridman, whose heroism saved a comrade who had attended the same kindergarten, as family plants trees and herbs to honor his memory For nearly 30 years, the kindergarten in Jerusalem’s Rassco neighborhood was known as Gan HaVradim (Garden of Roses) or Gan Ilana, named after longtime teacher Ilana Nakash. Last year, following the death of 21-year-old Staff Sergeant Shachar Fridman in Gaza, Ilana — who had been his kindergarten teacher — decided to rename the school in his honor. 'Shachar loved the sandbox,' she recalled. 'He would run around and play. He was loved by everyone and a friend to all.' On Tuesday, as part of Good Deeds Day, Shachar’s father, Doron, and his grandmother, Eti, visited the kindergarten to renovate its garden, plant a tree and grow herbs. 'It gives us strength,' Doron said. 'Seeing the children here is emotional. This is true remembrance — they’re growing up in Shachar’s light and his legacy carries on.'

Knesset approves key budget bills as deadline looms	Plenum approves in second and third reading the state budget framework, which will stand at 619 billion shekels, alongside a cut of 35 billion shekels to meet the 4.9% deficit target - 4.9%; It also approved the Economic Arrangements Law, which directs how the budget will be distributed; Budget must be approved by March 31 or the government will automatically dissolve The Knesset plenary approved overnight Wednesday-Thursday the frameworks and targets for Israel’s state budget for 2025 in its second and third readings. The state budget for the upcoming year is set at 619 billion shekels ($169 billion), with a deficit target of 4.9%. In addition, budget cuts totaling 35 billion shekels (about $9.5 billion) were approved to meet the deficit target. The bills were approved by a vote of 63-50 after a session that lasted for many hours and finished in the early hours of Thursday morning. The government hopes to finalize the approval of the state budget in the Knesset plenary by next week, with March 31 set as the legal deadline. As it stands, the coalition still faces significant work to meet this deadline. If the budget is not passed by the end of the month, according to Israeli law, the government will automatically dissolve, triggering new elections within 90 days. Among the measures approved overnight are changes to the mechanism for updating the reduced collection threshold for National Insurance contributions, aligning the indexing method for the salaries of officials in local and national government, freezing and reducing convalescence payments in 2025, and requiring public sector employees and senior officials to participate in fiscal stabilization efforts during 2025 and 2026, alongside other measures. 'The Knesset tonight approved the Economic Arrangements Law and the frameworks for the state budget for 2025, reflecting national and economic responsibility, while balancing the needs of security and civil resilience with maintaining economic stability,' said Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. 'This is a wartime budget, but also one of hope – a budget that provides the IDF and the defense establishment with all the necessary resources to defeat our enemies, while supporting reservists, business owners, the rehabilitation of the north and south, and Israel’s economic growth.' 'We continue to advance significant structural reforms – in combating black-market capital, improving services for citizens, and accelerating Israeli high-tech – so that the economy continues to grow and the burden is shared more fairly,' Smotrich added. 'Our economic policy is proving itself, as we see in the strong shekel, stock market performance, and the confidence shown by investors. This is a budget that strengthens our national resilience – economically, militarily and socially. We will continue to act decisively to ensure security, growth and stability for the people of Israel.'

Inside Israel’s missile shield: How IAI’s arrow system protects t...	Exclusive interview with Israel Aerospace Industry CEO Boaz Levy, who told ILTV News that the upcoming Arrow 4 missile defense system will be able to 'encounter any threats' The Houthis launched another rocket at Israel overnight, disregarding U.S. President Donald Trump’s warning that any attack by the Yemenite militants would be considered Iranian aggression and met with 'great force.' Israel and the U.S. have repeatedly threatened direct strikes on Iran’s oil or nuclear sites following Iran’s large-scale missile attacks in April and October. During these assaults, Iran fired hundreds of projectiles at Israel, aiming to devastate military sites and cause casualties. Fortunately, Israel’s Arrow defense system, developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), successfully intercepted the missiles. 'We knew that the system is very well tested. We knew that we have the best technology, but we never faced a real threat yet,' said Boaz Levy, CEO of Israel Aerospace Industries. 'And when more than 100 missiles arrived from Iran toward Israel, attacking populated areas, it was a moment of concern. But we knew that everything would work. And after a few seconds, when we saw the first interceptor launch toward the threat, we knew that it would be okay.' Last week, ILTV visited IAI to explore its latest technological advancements and financial growth. The company’s net income surged 55% last year, reaching $493 million in 2024. As part of the visit, ILTV conducted an exclusive interview with Levy, a key figure in the development of the Arrow defense system more than three decades ago. The Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems played a critical role in Israel’s defense during the April and October attacks. Now, IAI is finalizing the Arrow 4, a next-generation system designed to enhance missile interception at both high and low altitudes. 'We'll be able to do a shoot, look, shoot mechanism in order to encounter any threats,' Levy explained. 'Of course, the technology has been changed, the threat has been changed, and we are putting a lot of new features in these interceptors.' The Arrow defense system was originally developed in response to a question posed by the late U.S. President Ronald Reagan: 'Can you hit a bullet with a bullet?' 'It was like a technological answer to a future problem of intercepting ballistic missiles,' Levy said. 'Nobody thought about the scenario like we had in Iran. Nobody thought about a synchronized salvo that we had that night of April 14. But the system was designed robust enough, and thus this robustness gave us the solution of intercepting so many incoming missiles.' Looking ahead, Levy is confident that IAI’s engineers are continuing to push the boundaries of missile defense technology. 'I believe that a company like IAI, like Israel Aerospace Industries, that is leading this effort for the last 35 years or so, has the responsibility to predict the future,' he said. 'Engineers are working these days about the future capabilities, giving us the new design for the new types of threats that will appear in the near and far future. 'It’s a matter of understanding the capabilities of the threats and trying to design the right and optimal solutions for that, looking toward the full scenario, from acquiring the threat till the interception of it.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryvnamynyx	2025-03-19T20:55:48-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/20/HJYUyXtnyl/HJYUyXtnyl_0_458_1200_676_0_small.jpg

Trump to sign order to shut down Department of Education, White H...	U.S. President Donald Trump will sign a long-anticipated executive order on Thursday that aims to shut down the Department of Education, acting on a key campaign pledge, according to a White House summary seen by Reuters. The move was already being challenged by a group of Democratic state attorneys general, who filed a lawsuit seeking to block Trump from dismantling the department and halt the layoffs of nearly half of its staff announced last week. Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk have attempted to shut down government programs and institutions such as the U.S. Agency for International Development without congressional approval, but abolishing the Department of Education would be Trump's first attempt to shut down a cabinet-level agency. Trump cannot shutter the agency without congressional legislation, which could prove difficult. Trump's Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, but major legislation, such as a bill eliminating a cabinet-level agency, would need 60 votes and thus the support of seven Democrats to pass. Senate Democrats have given no sign they would support abolishing the Education Department.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1r4wjk3kx	2025-03-19T16:27:51-07:00

Unveiling October 7: UK report details Hamas brutality and fight ...	Despite no state inquiry in Israel, British lawmakers release 315-page report on Hamas attack, detailing planning, massacre data and new findings on 'sadistic barbarism not seen in world history since the Rape of Nanjing in 1937' and warns against subsequent swift denial Nearly a year and a half after the war began, and with an Israeli state commission of inquiry still a distant prospect, the most comprehensive report on the events of October 7 has been published - but not in Israel. British lawmakers on Tuesday released a detailed, 315-page report describing the massacre committed by Hamas and other terrorist organizations on what has come to be known as 'Black Saturday.' 'The purpose of this report is to clearly and accurately document the events of October 7, to ensure they are never forgotten,' said Lord Andrew Roberts, the historian who served as the lead author. Read the full report here. In his introduction to the report, Roberts wrote: 'Holocaust denial took a few years to take root in pockets of society, but on 7 October 2023 it took only hours for people to claim that the massacres in southern Israel had not taken place. Hamas and its allies, both in the Middle East and equally shamefully in the West, have sought to deny the atrocities, despite the ironic fact that much of the evidence for the massacres derives from film footage from cameras carried by the terrorists themselves.' Roberts said that the report 'has been undertaken to counter such pernicious views and to lay down incontrovertible proof.' 'Nearly 1,200 innocent people were indeed murdered by Hamas and its allies, and very often in scenes of sadistic barbarism not seen in world history since the Rape of Nanjing in 1937,' he wrote, referring to the Japanese army’s mass killing and rape campaign in China, where hundreds of thousands of civilians were murdered and tens of thousands of women were raped. The report was produced by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on UK-Israel, which includes members of the British Parliament and House of Lords, following more than a year of research and writing. Among its findings: 18 British citizens were killed on October 7, the highest number of Britons killed in a terrorist attack outside the UK since 9/11. One of the youngest victims documented was Naama Abu Rashed, a 14-hour-old infant. Her mother, Sujud, a resident of Abu Qrenat, was wounded in her ninth month of pregnancy while on her way to Soroka Medical Center. Naama was delivered in an emergency C-section but died before she was a day old. Sujud survived and gave birth to another child the following year. According to the report, 7,000 terrorists infiltrated Israel on October 7, murdering 1,182 people, injuring more than 4,000 and abducting 251 — 210 alive and 41 whose bodies were taken. 'This was the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust and the deadliest terror attack relative to population size — one in every 10,000 Israelis was killed,' the report said, describing it as the third-largest terror attack ever. Other sections detail Hamas’ preparations for the assault, including plans to reach Ashkelon and Kiryat Gat, and to break into Shikma Prison near Ashkelon. The report lists the number of people killed and abducted in each community and documents sexual violence and the desecration of bodies. Among new details cited by the Daily Mail is the final message sent by Jake Aaron Marlowe, a 24-year-old British-Israeli citizen who made Aliyah in 2021 and was working as a security guard at the Nova music festival. Shortly after 6:30 a.m., he messaged: 'We’re gathering people at the party and telling everyone to get out.' Marlowe was shot nine times. His father identified his body four days later by a tattoo. The report’s final chapter, 'In Memoriam,' lists the names of 1,141 victims, alphabetically from Meir Abergil, 55, of Sderot, to Dali Zhou, 35, a Chinese national who also lived in Sderot. It also includes the names of the 251 hostages, from Tamir Adar to Shlomi Ziv, who was freed during Operation Arnon.

Many flee east or back west to the festival grounds, where they are murdered. British-Israeli security guard Jake Marlowe, working at the festival, is killed by terrorists. The attack by the numbers and use of social media The first part of the report details the scale and planning behind the massacre. It reveals that 3,800 Hamas 'elite fighters,' specifically from its Nukhba unit, led the attack, alongside 2,200 terrorists from other groups, including Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Others were likely unaffiliated civilians. The report documents 119 breaches along the Gaza-Israel border, carried out with heavy weapons, drones and advanced munitions. A total of 4,860 rockets were launched at Israel over two days. The report emphasizes that Hamas planned the assault for years. Its fighters trained on precise models of Israeli communities near Gaza, gathering early intelligence on the layout of towns and homes, including safe rooms and shelters. Some arrived with lists of residents marked for assassination or abduction. British lawmakers noted in the Roberts report that Hamas terrorists documented their atrocities live on Facebook, TikTok and Telegram, transmitting graphic content to supporters worldwide, who then shared the images and celebrated on social media. In addition, the terrorists used victims' phones to send photos and videos directly to their families. Murder, violence and sexual assault against civilians The lawmakers detailed systematic executions and described cases in which residents were shot at point-blank range inside their homes, in fortified rooms and in bomb shelters. Some victims were burned alive after terrorists threw grenades into the safe rooms where they were hiding. The report’s authors emphasized that entire families were wiped out and that children and infants were found with severed limbs following the massacre. According to the report, 99 people were murdered in Kibbutz Be’eri, including entire families. In Kibbutz Kfar Aza, 62 victims were killed. Infants were found clutched to the bodies of their parents. The report listed 75 hostages taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz. At the Nova music festival near Re’im, more than 370 people were murdered, some of whom were hiding under the stage or in portable toilets. This section of the report also described ambushes that terrorists set along the roads, including Route 232, where they waited for festivalgoers attempting to flee and opened fire on their vehicles with assault rifles and RPGs. The report’s authors gathered testimonies of group rapes of women and girls, some of whom were murdered immediately afterward. They described how the bodies of women were found bearing signs of extreme violence following sexual assaults and collected additional accounts of sexual abuse committed against the corpses of victims. During the attack on the Nova festival, women were abducted into vehicles, where they were later raped and murdered. Another section of the report focused specifically on children who were harmed in the massacre. It included testimonies of children who witnessed their parents being murdered before their eyes and described incidents of children being abducted from their homes. The report mentioned Kfir Bibas, a nine-month-old whose name appeared on the list of hostages appended to the report, and emphasized that 'infants just a few months old were kidnapped.' It also noted cases in which babies were shot in their strollers, and some were burned alive. Looting, destruction and mutilation The report described how the terrorists systematically looted homes, stealing electronics, jewelry and food. After looting, they set homes on fire—even while residents were still hiding inside. In some cases, terrorists took photos of themselves inside the homes and sent the images to the victims’ families. > The report listed numerous instances of abuse and desecration of bodies, including dragging the corpses of hostages through the streets of Gaza and using bodies in Israeli communities as propaganda on social media. The terrorists decapitated victims and mutilated their bodies even after death. Attacks on military bases The report also analyzed the assault on military bases in the Gaza border region, including Nahal Oz, Re’im Base (home to the Gaza Division headquarters) and the Sufa outpost. The report described the murders of female lookouts in command centers and bunkers, and noted that soldiers at the attacked bases were often killed while unarmed. The British report describes the assault as 'a meticulously planned operation designed not only to kill but to terrorize through extreme brutality, looting and humiliation.' It adds that: 'Our report will hopefully permit people to see such denials and justifications for what they really are: a perversion of and rejection of human decency. We owe it to the victims and their grieving families to set down the ghastly unvarnished truth about the sheer barbarism that Hamas and its terrorist allies unleashed on 7 October 2023.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjz09wuhye	2025-03-19T15:53:47-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/Hkm34XC9Jl/Hkm34XC9Jl_0_458_851_479_0_small.jpg
Amid renewed fighting, Hamas holds firm in negotiations as Israel...	Terror group remains defiant despite fighting restart, as Israel escalates military operations; IDF resumes strikes and regains partial control of Netzarim Corridor; US says ceasefire extension proposal in exchange for 5 hostages 'still on the table' Despite the resumption of hostilities in Gaza, Hamas remains steadfast in its negotiating position, and talks with the terror group are currently at a standstill. In response, Israeli leadership has decided to gradually intensify military operations against Hamas to increase pressure and push the group back to the negotiating table. While negotiations remain deadlocked over the release of hostage Edan Alexander—a demand specifically backed by the United States—Hamas spokesman Abdel Latif al-Qanua said on Wednesday that 'any proposal based on entering the second phase of negotiations and a permanent end to the war will be welcomed and open for discussion. We want to stop the bloodshed and are open to any efforts that lead to a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal from Gaza.' Meanwhile, Hamas issued a direct threat following the IDF’s renewed partial takeover of the Netzarim Corridor. In an official statement, the group warned, 'We hold Israel and its leadership fully responsible for the consequences of this ground incursion into central Gaza, which constitutes a dangerous new violation of the ceasefire agreement.' Hamas also responded to Defense Minister Israel Katz’s warning that 'what comes next will be far worse, and you will pay the full price,' declaring that 'Israel’s repeated threats to expel our people from their land will not weaken our resolve.' Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department said on Wednesday there was still 'a bridge proposal on the table that would extend the ceasefire' in Gaza but the opportunity for it was 'closing fast.' 'Right now, we still have a bridge proposal on the table that would extend the ceasefire and see the release of five live hostages, including American Edan Alexander. It would also see the release of a substantial number of Palestinians held in Israeli jails,' a State Department spokesperson said, blaming Hamas. 'The opportunity is still there, but it's closing fast.' The IDF announced Wednesday evening that it expanded ground operations in central and southern Gaza over the past 24 hours, aiming to broaden security zones and create a partial buffer between northern and southern Gaza. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: As part of the operation, IDF forces regained control of key areas along the Netzarim Corridor, the military said. Additionally, the Golani Brigade has been deployed to the southern sector and remains on standby for further operations in Gaza. The IDF reiterated that it will continue targeting terrorist groups in the enclave to protect Israeli citizens. The move is seen as additional pressure on Hamas and Gaza’s population, aiming to prevent further infiltration of terrorists from the south after thousands crossed northward following the IDF’s withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor six weeks ago. Gazans reported that Israeli tanks had advanced into the area, halting vehicle movement along the blocked route. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that negotiations with Hamas will now take place only under fire, following the resumption of intense Israeli military operations in Gaza. In a pre-recorded statement, Netanyahu said Israel returned to combat after Hamas refused all ceasefire and hostage release proposals. Hamas, however, countered that Israel had refused to uphold its commitments in the second phase of negotiations, which would have included a full withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war—stating that this was why the release process for the remaining 59 hostages had stalled. The terror group also denied rejecting the U.S.-brokered bridging proposal, despite agreeing only to release Edan Alexander and four deceased hostages, all of whom hold American citizenship. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1hqyr00hjx	2025-03-19T15:34:50-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/19/rJiQfV00nyl/rJiQfV00nyl_34_378_478_270_0_small.jpg
Where are 20 billion shekels hiding, waiting to help rebuild Isra...	Batel Balaish-Soltnik and Ora Peled-Nakash, two trailblazing women in their fields, left successful careers in high-tech to lead the AID Coalition slate in the World Zionist Congress elections, determined to ensure that its vast resources are directed toward Israel’s recovery in the wake of the war In collaboration with AID Coalition 'I found myself at an event where a Nova survivor was speaking,' recalls Attorney Batel Balaish-Soltnik, a mother of four, a graduate of the prestigious IDF naval officers’ course, the first female skipper in the Israeli Navy, and a high-tech executive. 'She was telling the story of one of Nova’s heroes. As I listened, I suddenly realized she was talking about a member of my own family. At that moment, I got up on stage and embraced her.' That was the pivotal moment that drove Balaish-Soltnik to join forces with Ora Peled-Nakash and Jonathan Bar Shada in founding AID Coalition and launching their campaign for the World Zionist Congress elections. Watch the interview: 'The war truly connected us to the opportunity to help Israeli society,' says Ora Peled-Nakash, a high-tech entrepreneur, CEO, and the first female naval officer in the Israeli Navy. 'We built a bridge that allowed us to provide aid to resilience centers in Ofakim and Sderot, to evacuation centers in Eilat and the Dead Sea, to support cultural programs, activities for children and youth, and to offer emotional assistance to Nova survivors,' she says with emotion. 'Our plan is to maintain this connection and translate it into long-term action.' Anyone who grew up in Israel learned about the World Zionist Congress in history class as the body founded by Herzl in 1897 to advance the Zionist movement. Today, more than a century later, it controls enormous budgets with the potential to impact the lives of Jews around the world. 'The World Zionist Congress is the only democratic body that allows Jews in the United States, including Israelis living there, to influence the distribution of billions of dollars,' explains Balaish-Soltnik. 'These funds are allocated to national institutions such as Keren Hayesod, Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael (JNF), the Settlement Division, the Department for Combating Antisemitism, and The Jewish Agency.' How is it that, for years, these elections have flown under the radar? Why do so few people even know they have the right to vote? 'We were taught that it’s all about political maneuvering and appointments—things that happen behind closed doors and don’t concern us,' explains Peled-Nakash. 'But since the war, we’ve come to understand that we cannot afford to ignore spheres of influence where priorities can be reshaped—and that’s exactly where we want to be.' What happens to $1.5 billion a year? The World Zionist Congress convenes every four to five years and controls an annual budget of nearly $1.5 billion, which is distributed according to the decisions of the elected representatives. 'This is the only democratic body that allows Jews in the U.S., including Israelis among them, to directly influence the allocation of billions of dollars,' Balaish-Soltnik explains. 'The question is—should these funds continue to be funneled into narrow, sectoral interests? Or should they be directed toward what truly matters here and now—rebuilding Israel after the devastating events of October 7? The North, the South, pre-military academies, core education, public education—this is where we believe the money should go.' According to Ora and Bat-El, the World Zionist Congress currently operates with a lack of transparency. 'It’s important to remember that the national institutions were established before the State of Israel was founded,' says Peled-Nakash. 'This means they are not subject to Israeli transparency laws. Through our elected representatives, we aim to improve governance within these institutions, lift the curtain on how things are run—because these are resources that belong to you, to me, to the entire Jewish people.' Time to act: vote and influence A Call to Action: Vote and Make an Impact AID Coalition is a non-partisan slate composed of over 180 Israelis living in the U.S., coming from backgrounds in high-tech, entrepreneurship, business, and social activism. 'These are dedicated individuals who care deeply about Israel and place it at the forefront of their priorities,' says Peled-Nakash. 'The greater our representation within the World Zionist Congress, through the slate we’ve established and our elected representatives, the more our voices will be heard,' Balaish-Soltnik explains. 'We will be able to ensure that these budgets are directed—this is the bottom line—toward broad, impactful goals: rebuilding Israel.' The World Zionist Congress elections opened today, March 10, and will continue for several weeks. Any Jewish person over the age of 18, especially Israelis living in the U.S., is eligible to vote. 'It’s incredibly simple, and it can bring about enormous change,' emphasizes Balaish-Soltnik. The voting process is entirely digital: voters fill out a registration form, pay a symbolic $5 membership fee to the World Zionist Organization, and cast their vote. Ora and Bat-El urge the community to take action: 'If you have friends, family members, or acquaintances in the U.S., tell them to vote.'

Freed from Hamas captivity, Tal Shoham’s first question: Who surv...	Shoham returned from Hamas captivity frail but standing tall. Now, he’s fighting for those still held, saying, 'I left my brothers behind, and I must save them.' As he reconnects with his wife and children, his 10-year-old son sums it up: 'Finally, the four of us' The first message came through on a Tuesday at 3:19 p.m., when my son, Omer, sent a brief update to the family’s WhatsApp group: 'Hamas has officially announced: Six hostages will be released on Saturday.' We didn’t need more than this terse statement to realize—our Tal Shoham was on the list. 'Insane!!!' my wife, Gila, responded. 'Yessss!!!' my daughter, Shira, added. 'Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,' wrote my other daughter, Ella. 'Is anyone able to focus on anything right now?' Shira wondered. 'Absolutely not,' Ella replied. And me? I was in my study, lit only by my desk lamp, staring at an article about an IDF operation to clear an area along the Lebanese border. A big story in normal times, a nuisance on a day like this. Should I believe it? Should I feel excited? Was there a muscle of emotion left after 501 days of anxiety, frustration, political spins and disappointment? > WhatsApp kept buzzing with festive messages, decorated with heart and fingers-crossed emojis. Someone reminded me of what I had said back then, when six members of our family were freed after 50 days in captivity, except for Tal, my niece’s husband: 'Six out of seven released. Soon it will be seven out of seven.' But we still had to wait until we could see him with our own eyes. Saturday had never felt so far away from Tuesday. 'It’s all crazy' On Saturday at 9:49 a.m., Tal stood on Hamas' stage in Rafah, a microphone in his hand, reciting a dictated text. On Al Jazeera’s live broadcast, no one could hear what he was saying, probably a sound issue, and thankfully so. At 9:52 a.m., he entered a Red Cross vehicle. That was it, he was no longer a hostage. At exactly 10 a.m., he reached Israeli forces inside Gaza. In a locked room at Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva, after putting away our smartphones, an intelligence officer allowed us to watch this moment on live broadcast. Then, between the white Red Cross vehicle and the blue armored IDF vehicle, standing in front of a doctor and a psychologist who looked excited even without hearing a sound, Tal’s first smile was captured. The explosion of joy in the room was instant, accompanied by uncontrollable sobbing (of his brother and sister, Mor and Lee), hand-waving and a triumphant 'Yesss!' (of his brother-in-law, Yuval), tears streaming down the cheeks (of Anna-Lee, Yuval’s wife), and a spontaneous leap toward the ceiling (of me, or at least, that’s how it felt. A video clip that aired later revealed I had only clapped my hands). From the next stop, the Re’im military base, we got updates from Tal’s parents, Gilad and Nitza, reporting that Tal's wife, Adi, had sprinted toward him with their children, Naveh and Yahel, as cries of 'Daddy, Daddy' filled the air. Within moments, the parents too, were to join the family embrace with overwhelming happiness. Then, inside the helicopter, up in the sky, using a dry-erase board, a first message is written to the entire Israeli excited nation: 'Freedom,' Adi wrote. Naveh added, 'This is crazy.' These days, everything is 'crazy' to Naveh, from a delicious schnitzel to his father’s return. Then came the landing at Rabin Medical Center, with the roar of engines, the powerful wind and the partition shielding the newly free hostages from the gathered crowd. A tinted window vehicle was instructed to take them straight to the hospital, but suddenly, it stopped. Tal had spotted his cheering friends holding banners in his honor. Against protocol, the door opened, and another smile - this time beaming from ear to ear – emerged; a smile that spread to the crowd, to the cameras and within minutes, across news sites and TV channels. Tal is back. Tal is laughing. Tal is here. 'He’s just being so himself,' Adi would say at the end of the day. Inside the dedicated reintegration wing at Rabin Medical Center, in the isolated rooms prepared for the freed hostages, it became clear just how present he was. Thin but standing upright, focused, joking with his visitors. 'The only thing I need for rehab is a toothpick,' he joked, pulling his favorite type from his pocket which had already been supplied to him. Just thinking about where he had started the day - in a dark tunnel, from which he was later transferred in a hostile vehicle to a square filled with armed terrorists for Hamas' cynical display - and where he was ending it: in a bright, orderly hospital ward, surrounded by his loved ones, receiving every possible treatment and comfort, and ongoing deliveries. 'Here, take some Dubai chocolate,' he urged. 'I really feel like going to weddings' There are a million things Tal will have to catch up on after spending 505 days in Hamas captivity. 505 days that felt like 15 years to us, so how must they have felt to him? For now, he’s trying to absorb an 'ocean' of missing information, one spoonful at a time. First, he must know who is alive and who is dead. About some of them he already knew, about others, he didn’t. Kibbutz Be’eri lost 102 members on October 7, an endless list. And on a much smaller scale, the family dog, Liza, vanished and never returned. Tal remembers every detail of his abduction. How he, his wife and their children had come to Be’eri to celebrate Simchat Torah at the home of Adi’s parents, Shoshan and Avshalom ('Avshal'). How, early in the morning (of October 7), they heard the alert sirens, then the approaching terrorists and their hiding in the safe room, everyone except Avshal, who stood outside with a kitchen knife until Tal called him in, realizing it was futile. He recalls how they froze in place as bullets pierced the fortified door, while the terrorists were trying unsuccessfully to break in. And how, finally, Hamas operatives brought in a small bulldozer, smashing the mechanical arm against the steel window frame, prying it loose. In the few seconds between life and death, Tal and Avshal decided to surrender. One by one, the eight of them were pulled out through the window; Tal first, with his hands raised, then the rest. Tal was shoved into the trunk of one car. Shoshan, Adi, their children Naveh and Yahel, Avshal’s sister Sharon and her daughter Noam were crammed into another car. Avshal was left behind to his lethal fate. So were Lilach, my sister and Shoshan’s sister, and her husband Evyatar, who were murdered in their home next door. 'Avshal and you saved everyone else’s lives with that decision,' Mor tells Tal now that he's back. And only now is Tal beginning to understand just how much they all owe him for what happened a year and five months ago. During those terrifying minutes, Adi had risked her life even further. As the terrorists grabbed Yahel and Naveh, she fought back. 'Mother, girl!' 'Mother, boy!' she screamed toward the terrorists, refusing to let go until she wrestled the children back into her arms. As for Tal, even in captivity, despite all the signs pointing to the worst, he clung to the hope that Avshal had survived the massacre. Now, slowly, he starts to reveal glimpses of the hellish months that followed, what the captors were like, about the other hostages who were together with him. He marked his 40th birthday in a tunnel, longing for his family. 'I knew when the date of my birthday was, because from October 7, I kept track of every single day that passed,' he says. Maybe, one day, he will share more, when the layers begin to peel away, revealing what truly lingers in his soul. For now, nothing compares to being a father again, reconnecting with his greatest treasures, just as they are feeling their way back to him. 'Do you want a hug?' he asks Yahel, who slowly steps into his arms. 'It’s amazing how much she’s grown,' he observes. 'Naveh remained the same Naveh.' 'Finally, it's the four of us again,' Naveh sums up the reunion. But Tal will soon realize just how much Naveh has grown and changed, too. He’s no longer an anonymous figure. He told his story in interviews around the world, featured on front pages. He even appeared on Yedioth Ahronoth’s sports section cover, holding a soccer boot, the only one that survived the explosion that destroyed his home in Be’eri. It was the same boot that Israel’s national team captain, Eli Dasa, displayed at a press conference while Naveh was still in captivity. And little Yahel, with her golden curls and pure eyes, became a symbol of the fight to bring home more than 200 hostages. Her photo graced the cover of Yedioth Ahronoth supplement, then stretched across giant billboards on Tel Aviv’s Ayalon Highway. Later, Adi would post the heartbreaking, innocent questions that Yahel and Naveh asked during their father’s absence; children who, before October 7, had been shielded from social media by protective parents. Tal will probably be shocked to realize how they became, in spite of themselves, the presenters of the struggle for his release. But there’s good news waiting for him too, updates that never made it to the underground in Gaza. His sister Lee and her partner Meni had a baby boy, Ori. Daniel and Shaked, Adi’s sister, welcomed a daughter, Ora. Anna-Lee and Yuval, Adi’s brother, had a girl named Noga. Lee and Yuval had been waiting to hold their weddings until he returned. 'I really feel like going to some weddings,' Tal says. Then Mor drops another surprise: 'I have a girlfriend.' 'Really?' Tal asks, caught off guard. 'Yeah,' his brother confirms. 'Eight months now. She’s part of the Hostage and Missing Families Forum.' Her name is Maya, the cousin of Iair Horn, who was also freed from captivity, and of his brother Eitan, who is still held in Gaza. A story of darkness and love. And then, one last revelation, one that might shock Tal even more. 'You know,' his mother, Nitza, tells him hesitantly, a mix of embarrassment and pride in her voice, 'I traveled to the Graves of the Righteous in Poland. I promised I’d do everything to bring you home. And I did.' A social media star holding a joint Suddenly, the faces of Nitza, Gilad, Mor, Lee, Shoshan, Yuval, Shaked and Adi, especially Adi, radiate ease. Their eyes are bright, their breathing steady. For the first time in ages, Adi can say, as she tries once again to persuade Naveh into the shower: 'Tomorrow, it’s Tal’s turn to do bath time.' Shoshan would say 'Now I can read Ynet without feeling like there’s a noose around my neck.' But throughout the exhausting, endless months, one thing was clear to all of them: Tal would come back. It became a mantra, repeated to reinforce their belief, alongside an unshakable confidence in Tal's nature, his ability to remain calm in even the most harrowing situations, to keep his spirit free even when his body was chained. From the moment he was taken, his closest family members dedicated themselves completely to the fight for his release (Shoshan and Adi, who were also hostages in Gaza, apologize, as they were only able to join after 50 days). They pushed themselves to the ends of the earth and to the edge of their own strength, each in their own way. Tal's parents and siblings attended rallies, lobbied Knesset and spoke in TV studios, sometimes calmly, sometimes raising their voices. Like so many other hostage families, they were forced into roles they never imagined for themselves. Take Mor, for example, he never hides that he rolls his own medical marijuana cigarettes. When he got his first video call with Tal after his release, he was outside Rabin Medical Center, bouncing with excitement, holding a joint so massive it turned him into a viral sensation. The next day, he stood at a hospital press conference, buttoned up and composed, delivering a formal speech. Adi chose a quieter path. She would meet with anyone she believed could help across the entire political spectrum. One meeting after another, face to face, holding direct and candid conversations. 'This isn’t a reality show. It’s a matter of life and death,' she explained when asked why she avoided the spotlight and why she was so meticulous about every action she took, or every action she decided not to take. What she did have to say, she expressed in restrained yet powerful social media posts, presenting glimpses of real life, using poignant words that pierced straight through the heart. Both in Gaza and after their release, she protected Naveh and Yahel every minute of every day, assuming as much as possible, the role of two parents at once. She fought for Tal as if she had no children, and she fought for her children as if she had no husband to save. She was there - one hundred percent for the children, and one hundred percent for Tal. Looking at her impossible daily schedule - waking the children up, feeding them, arranging childcare, driving to a meeting, returning home, putting them to bed, waking up again, packing for a trip, making sure nothing is forgotten, unpacking, searching for the missing sandal, heading to another meeting - you couldn’t help but seeing a bionic woman. 'When does she have a moment to herself to process everything she’s been through?' people asked me. Despite the children’s young age, she always told them the truth, even when it was painful. Because for her, truth was the foundation of trust between them. That’s why she kept them informed of every stage of the hostage negotiations, laying out both the chances and the obstacles, never offering false hope. Even on that terrifying Saturday of October 7 in Be’eri, with terrorists outside and sheer panic inside, when Naveh asked her if they were going to die, she answered: 'I really hope not. But I don’t know.' She didn’t want the last thing he might ever hear from her would be a lie. Learning to speak out loud again During the past weeks, Friday after Friday, like a relentless torture on steroids, Adi would get a call from the army’s liaison officer, Col. Adi Bershadsky (a woman with both rank and a heart of gold), citing the list of hostages set to be released the following day, and each time, Tal’s name was not on it. How can you keep going for another week like that without collapsing or falling into pieces? You can, because you have no other choice. Because there’s Naveh and Yahel. Because hope is not something you can afford to lose. Naveh was eight when he was kidnapped. On the way to Gaza, surrounded by armed Hamas terrorists, he saw the bodies of his neighbors from Be’eri lying on the ground, the smoke billowing over burning homes. In the Gaza hideouts where he and his family were held, he saw terrorists with loaded rifles. When he returned home, he expressed the trauma he had suffered through furious drawings, depicting evil-looking terrorists and scrawling words of hate. For a time, he became attached to toy guns, carrying them everywhere, firing imaginary bullets at anyone in sight. To those around him, it was clear: after everything he had been through, he needed to reclaim control, to be the one who instilled fear, rather than the one who felt it. From a soft, innocent boy he turned into a little man, nearly 10, who plays soccer and water polo, learned how to surf on a SUP, and rides his bike non-stop. Since his release, he has traveled extensively, often with Adi and Yahel, to show the world what it means to be a freed hostage with a father still in captivity. He also met the pope, who had previously replied politely to Naveh's letter. He also flew abroad with relatives for soccer matches, allowing him a small escape from reality. In Budapest, for example, he watched Israel suffer a 4-1 defeat against Iceland, but he focused on the experience rather than the score. 'The third goal was the most beautiful one,' he generously praised the Icelandic striker. Later, in the team’s somber locker room, he hugged star striker Eran Zahavi, captain Eli Dasa and, most of all, goalkeeper Omri Glazer, because Naveh hugs everyone, especially those connected to his beloved Hapoel Be’er Sheva soccer team, the team he chose to support in honor of his late grandfather, Avshal. Yahel was three and a half when she was shoved into the car that took her to captivity in Gaza. A toddler thrown instantly from paradise into hell. When her family members who were captive with her were ordered to whisper rather than speak, because their captors feared Israeli surveillance might pick up their voices, she was the first to internalize it. In the darkest moments, she even cried soundlessly. Only by watching her eyes could Adi and Shoshan feel her distress and they would approach to comfort her. When she returned home, it took three weeks for her to stop whispering and regain her normal voice. And then, slowly, the real Yahel, 'Yula', began to shine again. She turned five while Tal was still in captivity. She was once again an expressive, joyful child, but also mature beyond her years. During that time, the family found an unexpected connection with famed singer Yehudit Ravitz, who had reached out in solidarity. When they attended Ravitz's concert, Yahel matter-of-factly stated, 'Yehudit is friends with Mommy, and with Naveh, and with me, so when Daddy comes back, she has to be his friend too.' She recorded messages for Tal, telling him how much she missed him. She wrote him letters, decorating them with drawings of flowers, sun, blue skies. In one, she sketched a figure with arms spread wide, 'Daddy wants a hug but no one is coming to him,' she explained. Once-a-month movie and dinner Shoshan joined the struggle to bring back the hostages, and she was aiming high. She met with U.S. senators and senior officials, addressed the United Nations Security Council, held a conversation with the secretary-general, joined the board of Hostage Aid, an organization advocating for hostages worldwide, and even attended Trump’s inauguration, where he had the privilege of shaking her hand. Yuval, who was also part of the struggle, organized a five-day solidarity march from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in November 2023, with the participation of tens of thousands of people, calling for the hostages' return. Since then, he has led countless tours of Be’eri for anyone who might help - from Jerry Seinfeld to Likud party officials. Shaked took on the role of family coordinator, legal and spiritual advisor, and was responsible for the dialogue held with the religious Zionist party officials. Even Tal’s distant family relatives and acquaintances rallied to the cause. From his 'turbo-powered' cousin, Inbal Zach, to the members of the communities of Ma’ale Tzvia and Be’eri, where he had lived. And then there was us, pressuring for a deal at protests, staging guerrilla actions on highways, traveling abroad as part of advocacy delegations, amplifying the cause in the media, babysitting Naveh and Yahel. Other matters were put aside, like opening mails, replacing burned-out light bulbs, pruning the grapevines that were brought from Be’eri, sorting through the boxes salvaged from the burned-out homes at the kibbutz. Some things were neglected due to lack of time or energy, others due to emotional overload, like mourning the deaths of Avshal, Lilach, and Evyatar. But in the end, all the effort was worth it. The first time I stepped behind the partitioned area at Beilinson Hospital, Tal broke from another embrace to wrap me in a long hug (I made sure not to embrace him too tightly). He looked at me with shining eyes and said: 'In March, I saw Ella at a protest, holding a sign with my picture on it, right near a water cannon. A little later, I saw Gila holding the same sign. Tell them it really strengthened me to know people were fighting for us.' Two days later, Tal was locked in a tearful, lingering embrace with Ella. 'Lali,' he called her - his nickname for her as a baby – saying in his shaking voice: 'It was surreal, in the heart of Gaza, seeing a sign, a familiar face, standing against...' (he caught himself, realizing Naveh was nearby and might be hearing) ... 'Our, uh, 'police officers'. 'It really thrilled me', he added. 'I’m so happy to hear that,' she answered. 'That’s all I wanted.' And they hugged again. The realization that families were never meant to sit quietly at home as they were requested and knowing that their cries for the hostages’ release had actually reached the right ears, strengthened also those in Israel who had fought for their return. Beilinson’s reintegration ward became a kind of family guesthouse. The four hostages who were freed that day and their family relatives, who had fought for their release, became one unit. Especially Tal and Omer Wenkert, who had spent eight and a half months together in the same tunnel. 'Sometimes I see them standing in the hallway, talking, and I want to eavesdrop, to hear what they’re saying, but then I take a step back. That’s their private conversation,' says Omer’s father, Shay. 'You see them together, and you melt,' says Nitza. 'Tal tells us ‘They’re my family.’ It’s so good to see him. He just needs to gain some weight.' The lost kilograms will be regained gradually, but his appetite for life is returning fast. 'There are two things I want from you,' Tal told me when we sat in the family room. 'To take Naveh to a Ha'Poel Be’er Sheva match, as Avshal would have, and to watch a Maccabi Tel Aviv EuroLeague game with him.' I promised to arrange the first. The second? Not so much. 'You’ve suffered enough,' I told him, updating him on Maccabi’s bad season. And to Shira and Ella, he said: 'Once I recover a bit, from now on, Adi and I are going out once a month for dinner and a movie. You will be babysitting.' 'As long as the kids get unlimited screen time,' they answer. 'Of course,' they agreed. 'We’ll allow that much.' Without the paralyzing fear Before the time for fun comes, there’s still an urgent battle to bring home the 59 hostages who remained in Gaza, both the living and the dead. One way to highlight the urgency and engage the public is by meeting with groups that visit the Hostage Square in Tel Aviv. Personally, I’m most comfortable talking to pre-army academy students - young, mature, intelligent people with a sense of responsibility, who want to do good. When you share the story of your family, they're usually focused. But there’s always that one kid, the yawner. It doesn't matter the time of day or what you’re saying, you see them yawning 'And then my little sister was murd...' – yawn - '...ered in the safe room, along with her husband.' When you shoot them a glance, as if to signal that it's inappropriate, the yawner turns his head, pretending you referred to someone behind him. 'I’m really sorry,' you want to tell him, 'Next time I’ll try to tell a less boring story.' But maybe it’s understandable. Someone with no personal connection to the struggle and or to the hostages can’t really grasp the reality of the families. For those in the close family circle, though, the impact of the struggle is constant, through the unbearable waiting, through a government that prioritizes political survival over human lives, through sleepless nights. No wonder families of the hostages are eligible for psychological therapy. Some find relief in support groups, others in one-on-one sessions. Many of them benefit from processing the trauma while confronting the pain. In principle, I’m all for it. In practice, it doesn’t work for me. I gave it a shot, week after week. Another chance, another session. The psychologist tried too, gently probing, looking for cracks. She encouraged me to keep at it. But in the end, my tough genetics won out. I finally told her, above the untouched box of tissues: 'You made great progress in these three months, but I think it’s time we part ways.' Now, the right thing to do is give Tal quiet and peace. Time for him, for Adi, for Naveh and Yahel to decide if and what kind of help they need. If their lives before October 7, 2023, are any indication, they’ll retreat into their intimate cocoon, choosing carefully who to share their space with, trying to reclaim the 505 days stolen from them. Whether that’s possible? That's another question. 'But in the meantime, we can’t let up. From now on, we’ll fight for those who are still there, but without the paralyzing fear,' Adi put it best. Gilad and Nitza knew it too. Just ten hours after their joyous reunion with Tal at Re’im military base, they were already standing in front of a microphone at the Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, freed from the personal weight they had carried. 'Now we have even more strength to fight,' Nitza said, suddenly looking ten years younger. 'Did you treat yourself to some facial cosmetic work?' I asked. 'No,' she answered. 'It’s just that my son came back, nothing more.' We were there too, this time without the T-shirts with Tal’s face printed on them, just the generic 'Bring Them Home' shirts. And memories of the very first T-shirts we wore after that terrible Saturday, back then, when everything was still chaos, printed with the faces of 12 kidnapped family members, alongside the word KIDNAPPED. Only later did we learn that three had been murdered and nine were taken hostage. Seven from Be’eri, two from Nahal Oz. The day after his release, Tal joined the fight to bring all the hostages home. 'I feel like I left my brothers behind,' he said, 'and I have to save them.' He signed a letter written by former captive fathers, calling for an immediate deal. This week, he met with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Herzog, Adi at his side. Just like Eli Sharabi, Iair Horn, Ohad Ben Ami, Keith Siegel, and so many other scarred survivors from the tunnels. Because every single hostage freed becomes another 'soldier' in the most important battle. Until the last hostage comes home. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bjn00nohhyx	2025-03-19T13:32:22-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/13/SkZS00XMg2Jg/SkZS00XMg2Jg_242_453_2695_1518_0_small.jpg
Ben-Gvir and allies rejoin government after two-month hiatus	Knesset approves far-right firebrand's return as national security minister, solidifying Netanyahu’s coalition ahead of budget vote; Ben-Gvir, whose party quit over Gaza ceasefire, rejoins after pushing for renewed fighting and key dismissals The Knesset on Wednesday approved the return of Itamar Ben-Gvir’s far-right Otzma Yehudit party to the governing coalition, two months after its ministers resigned in protest over the temporary ceasefire in Gaza. The vote reinstated Ben-Gvir as national security minister, Amichai Eliyahu as heritage minister and Yitzhak Wasserlauf as minister for the Negev and Galilee, bolstering the coalition’s majority to 68 seats ahead of a crucial budget vote. The 65-46 vote in favor of the appointments was met with applause from coalition members, while opposition lawmakers walked out in protest during the swearing-in ceremony. The attorney general’s office had opposed Ben-Gvir’s reinstatement, citing concerns over his previous remarks against Israel’s judiciary and law enforcement. However, the government unanimously approved his appointment on Tuesday, overriding legal objections. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi used the occasion to launch a blistering attack on Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, accusing her of politicizing the legal system and vowing that Ben-Gvir would soon vote for her dismissal. 'She wants to control the government, but we will let the voters decide,' Karhi said. Ahead of the vote, the Likud and Otzma Yehudit parties announced a deal for the far-right faction’s return to government. Ben-Gvir later posted a photo with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on social media, captioning it: 'Together with strength, for the people of Israel.' His return came after weeks of negotiations, with Ben-Gvir demanding not only the resumption of military operations in Gaza but also steps to dismiss the attorney general and fire Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar. While these demands were initially dismissed, recent political shifts paved the way for his comeback. Following the vote, Ben-Gvir declared: 'I am resuming my leadership of the National Security Ministry. There is much work ahead, and I will continue implementing my policies in the Israel Police and prison service. Otzma Yehudit is back in the coalition, and Israel has resumed intense fighting in Gaza. Together, we will act for all of Israel.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjpxsio2yg	2025-03-19T12:47:32-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/19/HJwgdG0cO2Je/HJwgdG0cO2Je_108_239_1007_567_0_small.jpg

Protesters in Jerusalem threaten civil disobedience over Shin Bet...	Demonstrators block roads, set bonfires and clash with police outside Netanyahu’s Jerusalem residence; officer injured and hospitalized Thousands of demonstrators gathered Wednesday night outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem, protesting the dismissal of Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and what they called the government’s failure to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza. Protesters blocked roads, set bonfires and clashed with police, who used water cannons to disperse the crowd. One officer was lightly injured and taken to a hospital. In a separate incident, a protester was struck by a taxi and dragged several feet on the hood before falling to the ground. He sustained minor injuries, and both he and the driver were called in for questioning. Leading protest organizers threatened to escalate demonstrations into acts of civil disobedience, calling for mass strikes and nationwide disruption. Moshe Radman, a prominent activist, declared, 'In the coming days, we will stand here in shifts to show that we are moving from protest to civil disobedience.

Israeli Druze community rejects idea of separate state	In northern Israel, Druze, Muslims and Christians maintain unity despite regional conflicts Nestled in the hills of northern Israel, Maghar is home to a unique mix of Druze, Muslims and Christians who have coexisted for generations. With a population of approximately 22,000, the town comprises 60% Druze, 20% Muslims and 20% Christians. The Druze, a historically significant and close-knit community, number around 150,000 in Israel, while larger populations live in Syria and Lebanon. Though scattered across different nations, the Druze maintain a deep unity shaped by their religious beliefs and historical experiences. In Israel, the Druze have integrated into society, serving in the military, government and various professional fields, balancing their cultural heritage with their national identity. Since the establishment of Israel, the Druze have played an integral role in the state. Colonel (Res.) Hamada Ganim, a Druze former commander of the Northern Brigade in the Gaza Strip, emphasizes their longstanding service. 'From the time of Israel’s establishment, the Druze have been part of the country. We serve and contribute at every level of government, including the army. The Druze have served in the military since the state's founding, taking an active and central role in security and civil affairs. Overall, the Druze are well-integrated within Israel.' Eyal Ganim, an entrepreneur and former Israeli security officer, sheds light on the community’s sense of identity. 'First of all, we are Druze. Despite differences tied to geography and personal perspective, our core remains unchanged. We are Druze by faith, Arab by culture and Israeli by nationality. We are not interested in our own state; we are committed to our land and will protect it at any cost. That is why serving in the Israeli military is not just an obligation—it is a commitment.' He further highlights the Druze's role as bridge-builders. 'Our community always builds bridges, not walls. While the Druze in the Galilee see themselves as Israeli Druze, those in the Golan and other regions feel differently. But we all share a core identity.' The recent conflicts in Gaza have brought new challenges for Israel’s Druze community. Many serve in the military and have firsthand experience of the conflict. 'As Druze, we feel the conflict from both sides,' says Eyal Ganim. 'We speak Arabic and are connected to the Arab world, but we are also Israeli citizens and sympathize with the Jewish people. October 7 changed everything—it shattered illusions about security and stability. Despite the wars, people here want peace. I fight because I want to grant peace to this land one day.' With Syria in turmoil, discussions about a potential Druze state have resurfaced. While some advocate for an independent Druze homeland, many community leaders remain skeptical. 'I don’t think there will be a Druze state,' says Col. (Res.) Hamada Ganim. 'The Druze in Syria should stay loyal to their country if it protects them. If not, they must take control of their situation and defend themselves.' Eyal Ganim echoes this sentiment, explaining how the Druze identity is shaped by the country they live in. 'We belong to our respective nations, but Druze unity transcends borders. In Syria, Lebanon and Israel, we see ourselves as one people. However, politically and geographically, we differ, making it hard to speak for the entire community.' The crisis in Syria has placed the Druze in a precarious position. Rikad Khiraldin, Deputy CEO for Logistics at the National Insurance Institute and former head of the Druze town of Hurfeish, highlights the community’s historical ties to Syria. 'The Druze in Syria are Syrians in every way. No one can deny it. Historically, the ones who liberated Syria were the Druze—Sultan Pasha al-Atrash, who led the fight against the French in 1925. But today, Syria is not the same. With the rise of fundamentalist forces, Druze, Alawites and Christians must protect themselves.' The massacre of Alawites in Syria has raised fears of similar violence against the Druze. Reports suggest that Israel has offered assistance, but the response within the Druze community has been mixed. Some accept the aid, while others are wary of the political consequences. 'I don’t think a Druze state is the answer,' says Khiraldin. 'The Druze should not separate from Syria. I hope for long-term stability, but in the meantime, Israel must support them when needed.' Col. (Res.) Hamada Ganim warns of the deteriorating situation. 'Syria is in a dangerous place. The fall of Bashar Assad leaves uncertainty. We’ve seen the horrors in Latakia and Tartus. We hope the same fate does not befall the Druze. Minorities—Druze, Alawites and Christians—must protect themselves.' Beyond the challenges of conflict, communities in northern Israel continue to coexist. In Migdal, near Maghar and Tiberias, Tannourine Restaurant is a testament to interfaith harmony. Its owner, Hani Hana, reflects on the restaurant’s founding. 'My brother and I started this place with our mother 24 years ago. We wanted a space where Jews, Muslims, Druze and Christians could gather. Today, we see that vision come to life.' Hana highlights the difficulties Christians face in the region. 'In Israel, we have stability, but we struggle for representation. Our numbers are shrinking, and across the Middle East, our existence is threatened.' He believes that political leadership has failed to foster unity. 'The Middle East’s struggles are not about people—they’re about politics. Ordinary people want peace. If leaders focused on unity, everything would change.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In Migdal, architect Matti Avahalomov is working on a project that embodies the region’s diversity—the transformation of the Migdal Beach Promenade. 'The promenade will physically represent coexistence, incorporating Jewish, Christian and Islamic architectural elements to create a shared cultural space,' he explains. Avahalomov believes in the power of architecture to unite communities. 'People see a divide between Jews and Arabs, Israelis and Palestinians. But coexistence is real. We are building a future that embraces shared history and identity.' He emphasizes the role of public spaces in fostering dialogue. 'Architecture is more than just buildings—it is about identity. When we design spaces that bring different communities together, we create opportunities for understanding.' From Maghar to Tiberias, the voices of Israel’s Druze and Christian communities share a common theme: unity. Despite the conflicts that have defined the region, they have chosen coexistence. Their message is clear—peace is not just an aspiration but a choice.

Netanyahu blasts ‘leftist Deep State’ in response to ‘Qatar-Gate’...	Police detain 2 suspects in probe into alleged Qatari payments to Netanyahu’s office staff; PM denies wrongdoing in fiery post; further details remain under gag order The so-called 'Qatar-Gate' affair intensified Wednesday as police detained two key suspects, fueling scrutiny over alleged financial ties between the Qatari government and employees in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. Following the arrests, the official X account of Netanyahu’s office posted a statement drawing parallels to alleged political investigations against President Donald Trump in the U.S. 'In America and in Israel, when a strong right wing leader wins an election, the leftist Deep State weaponizes the justice system to thwart the people's will,' the post read. 'They won't win in either place! We stand strong together.' The post was removed shortly later and reposted on Netanyahu's personal account. Police have provided no further details on the case, citing a 30-day gag order, and Netanyahu himself has yet to comment on the detentions. The controversy escalated after Israeli businessman Gil Birger admitted to transferring funds from a Qatari government lobbyist to Eli Feldstein, a spokesperson in Netanyahu’s office. The revelation drew a sharp rebuke from former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who accused Netanyahu of knowingly allowing Qatari influence within his administration. 'The Prime Minister’s Office is Israel’s most sensitive security hub,' Bennett said in a fiery statement. 'If these actions were done knowingly, it’s outright treason. If unknowingly, it means Qatar has infiltrated Israel’s leadership.' Bennett further claimed that a senior security adviser in Netanyahu’s office was secretly paid by Qatar, saying, 'Qatar, the main financial backer of Hamas, funded the security spokesman of Israel’s Prime Minister—during wartime.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Netanyahu’s office denied all allegations, calling them 'baseless fake news.' 'This is a desperate attempt to fabricate a crime where none exists,' a statement from his office read, rejecting claims that it facilitated illicit payments. A sweeping gag order remains in effect, preventing the publication of critical details in the police investigation. Leading Israeli media outlets, including Ynet and its sister publication Yedioth Ahronoth, have petitioned for its removal, with a court hearing set for April 6 following a request from Shin Bet. According to reports, Feldstein—who previously failed a security clearance test—was unable to receive a salary from Netanyahu’s office through official channels. Instead, he was allegedly paid indirectly through Qatari-linked funds, transferred via the Qatari government, which sent the money to lobbyist Jay Footlik; Footlik himself, who transferred funds to Israeli businessman Gil Birger; and Birger, whose company allegedly funneled the money to Feldstein. As the scandal widens, Jonathan Urich, a close Netanyahu ally, has been accused of brokering the financial arrangement. However, his lawyer denied any involvement, stating Urich had no knowledge of Birger or any role in arranging payments. The Attorney General’s Office has tasked Shin Bet and police with a full investigation into the extent of Qatar’s ties to Netanyahu’s administration. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk7u11cdhjg	2025-03-19T11:06:47-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/18/ryvL2Evnke/ryvL2Evnke_0_0_569_321_0_small.jpg

Trump warns Iran to halt supplies to Houthis, predicts their defe...	POTUS says Tehran reduced arms shipments to Yemeni rebels but continues to send supplies, urging it to halt immediately; 'Let the Houthis fight it out themselves. Either way they lose, but this way they lose quickly' U.S. President Donald Trump warned on Wednesday that while Iran has reduced military equipment and direct support to the Houthis, it is still supplying them with large quantities of materiel. 'Iran must stop sending these supplies IMMEDIATELY,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'Let the Houthis fight it out themselves. Either way, they lose—but this way, they lose quickly.' Trump claimed that significant damage had already been inflicted on the Houthis and warned that it would only intensify. 'It's not even a fair fight, and never will be,' he added. 'They will be completely annihilated!' Residents in Sanaa, the Houthi stronghold, told Reuters that additional airstrikes hit the city near the airport on Wednesday. The U.S. military launched its weekend operation under orders from Trump after the Houthis vowed to resume attacks on Red Sea shipping linked to Israel and disrupt global trade routes. Since October 2023, these Houthi attacks—described by the group as acts of solidarity with Gaza—have inflicted severe damage on global maritime trade, forcing vessels to reroute away from the Suez Canal and drastically raising insurance costs. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On Tuesday, three days after U.S. airstrikes began, the Houthis’ foreign minister said the group was now effectively at war with the United States, warning of further escalation.

Meanwhile, Reuters cited two senior Iranian officials who said Tehran had twice urged the Houthis to de-escalate tensions, signaling concerns over the widening conflict. At the launch of the operation on Saturday, Trump warned the Houthis that 'hell will rain down' upon them and declared, 'Your time is up.' According to U.S. officials, several senior Houthi commanders have been killed since the strikes began.

Inside October 7 battle for Kibbutz Alumim: Heroism, horror and d...	IDF says 100 Hamas terrorists infiltrated Kibbutz Alumim, killing 22 inside and 35 nearby, mostly Nova festivalgoers; amid chaos, fleeing civilian and unidentified Thai worker mistakenly shot; investigators find area underprotected despite threat A small Golani Brigade force and heroic resistance from the local alert squad managed to repel Hamas’ initial assault on Kibbutz Alumim on October 7, 2023, but 22 people were killed inside the kibbutz, and 35 others nearby, most of them Nova music festival attendees fleeing the massacre. The attack also led to the abduction of five kibbutz residents, two of whom remain in captivity in Gaza. These findings come from the IDF’s investigation into the battle at Alumim, which was presented to the community in recent days and released to the public on Wednesday evening. The report details severe combat conditions, including friendly fire incidents that resulted in additional casualties. One of the friendly fire victims was Ofek Aton, who fled the Nova festival with his partner and found shelter in the kibbutz. Amid the chaos, he was mistaken for an enemy and shot dead by security forces. A similar case, still surrounded by uncertainty, involved a Thai worker who rushed toward Alumim after learning that his colleagues were being attacked. He climbed over the kibbutz fence to help but was mistaken for a terrorist and fatally shot by an IDF soldier. The probe found that no official confirmation of his identity had been issued by Israeli authorities. Additionally, two Israeli civilians were injured in separate friendly fire incidents that day. According to the investigation, Hamas breached the kibbutz at 7:01 a.m. under cover of a massive rocket and mortar barrage that had begun at 6:29 a.m. The attackers first targeted the dairy farm, where they murdered foreign workers. However, many diverted their focus to hundreds of Nova festival attendees who were fleeing along Route 232, adjacent to the kibbutz. Dozens were gunned down, while those who survived sought refuge inside the kibbutz, hiding in residents' safe rooms. At Nahal Oz, Capt. B., commander of a Golani Brigade reserve company, scrambled a small detachment, successfully repelling part of the Hamas assault. Inside the kibbutz, local alert squad members, police officers and armed civilians engaged in intense combat, holding off the infiltrators. Meanwhile, the first special forces team sent to reinforce the kibbutz, Shaldag Unit, was ambushed at the perimeter, suffering casualties. In total, 100 Hamas terrorists entered Alumim, and 40 were killed by security forces and the local alert squad. The tide turned later in the morning when Paratroopers' 890th Battalion arrived by helicopter at a landing zone near the kibbutz around 11:00 a.m. The force came under heavy fire upon landing, with one of their Sikorsky helicopters destroyed. Initially bound for Be’eri and Nahal Oz, the paratroopers diverted after hearing the gunfire from Alumim, leaving part of their force to assist in the battle. By the end of the day, 17 different IDF units had fought in Alumim, and by the afternoon, command and control had been restored. The nine-month-long investigation included interviews with soldiers, operational logs, surveillance footage, enemy body cameras and intelligence reports. The rapid response from the kibbutz alert squad played a crucial role in halting the Hamas infiltration. The report also credits the improvised command post set up at 11:00 a.m., which coordinated reinforcements and stabilized defensive lines. Another key factor was Alumim’s proximity to major battle zones such as Be’eri and Re’im. Many passing IDF units diverted to help after hearing gunfire, despite Alumim not being their original mission target. However, similar to other IDF post-battle reviews, the probe found that the Gaza Division and Northern Brigade had deployed too few forces to the area, despite known intelligence warnings about the Hamas threat.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rksnwd00nye	2025-03-19T09:05:07-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/16/B1xBcsI9Z6/B1xBcsI9Z6_0_133_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Judge says pro-Palestinian Columbia protestor must remain in US f...	Court rules Mahmoud Khalil must stay in US while arrest challenge moves to New Jersey; Khalil's lawyer says government moved him to Louisiana to avoid having case heard in New York or New Jersey A U.S. judge on Wednesday said Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil must remain in the United States for now, but moved his challenge to the legality of his arrest over his participation in pro-Palestinian protests to a court in New Jersey. Manhattan-based U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman denied a bid by the Trump administration to dismiss the case, but agreed with the Justice Department that he did not have jurisdiction because Khalil was held in New Jersey at the time his lawyers first challenged his arrest in New York. The case has become a flashpoint for Republican President Donald Trump's pledge to deport some non-U.S. citizens who took part in the protests against Israel's military campaign in Gaza that swept American college campuses including Columbia after the October 7 terror attack against Israelis by the Palestinian terror group Hamas. It will now be up to the New Jersey court to rule on Khalil's bids to declare his arrest unconstitutional, and to be released on bail or moved. Khalil's lawyers say his wife, an American citizen named Noor Abdallah, cannot visit him in Louisiana, where he is currently being held, because she is eight months pregnant with their first child. Khalil's lawyer Samah Sisay said in a statement on Wednesday that the government moved him to Louisiana to avoid having the case heard in New York or New Jersey. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on that assertion or on Furman's ruling. 'Mr. Khalil should be free and home with his wife awaiting the birth of their first child, and we will continue to do everything possible to make that happen,' Sisay said. Khalil, 30, was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on March 8 outside his university residence in Manhattan. His lawyers have said that he was targeted in retaliation for his role in advocating for Palestinian rights, meaning the arrest violated free speech protections under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. Khalil in a letter from detention released on Tuesday by his legal team called himself a 'political prisoner.' After his arrest, Khalil was taken to a federal building in lower Manhattan, and later moved to a detention facility in New Jersey in the early morning hours of March 9. His lawyer said she filed his first challenge to his arrest, known as a habeas corpus petition, in Manhattan federal court because an online ICE detainee locator showed he was still in Manhattan. > In his ruling, Furman said Khalil's petition raised serious allegations that warranted review. But he said there was no dispute that Khalil was in New Jersey at the time the petition was filed, meaning it should be heard there. 'At the heart of this case is the important question of whether and under what circumstances the Government may rescind a person’s lawful permanent resident status and remove him from the United States,' the judge wrote. 'Reasonable grounds' Furman rejected the government's request that the case be moved to Louisiana. If the case had been moved there, any potential appeals would have been heard by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the most conservative in the country. Any appeals of decisions in New Jersey would be heard by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is split 6-6 between active judges appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents. There are two vacancies that Trump can fill. Khalil, who is of Palestinian descent, entered the United States on a student visa in 2022 and secured lawful permanent residency - known as a green card - last year. Khalil became a visible leader of Columbia's pro-Palestinian protest movement while completing coursework for a master's degree in public administration. He is due to graduate in May. In ordering his removal, the administration has cited a little-used provision of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act allowing the deportation of any lawful permanent resident whose presence in the country the secretary of state has 'reasonable grounds to believe' could harm U.S. foreign policy. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 16 that taking part in 'pro-Hamas events' runs counter to U.S. foreign policy. Khalil's lawyers have said that their client has no ties to Hamas and acted as a 'mediator and negotiator' during the protests. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1a00awunjg	2025-03-19T08:38:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/13/r1vqOxl3ke/r1vqOxl3ke_0_70_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
What’s driving the escalating violence at the Syria-Lebanon borde...	Hezbollah smuggling thrived under Assad, but al-Sharaa regime crackdown sparks heavy border clashes with Lebanon; despite ceasefire announcement, fighting continues as both sides send reinforcements to border region At least seven Lebanese civilians have been killed amid reports of Hezbollah abducting and killing Syrian soldiers, heavy exchanges of fire and widespread looting and arson targeting homes. In the past week, the conflict along the Syria-Lebanon border has escalated, an area already marked by tension since the fall of the Assad regime in December and the rise to power of jihadist rebels led by Ahmad al-Sharaa. Several Syrian soldiers have been killed since the outbreak of the clashes on Sunday. However, Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar reported on Wednesday that the death toll on the Syrian side has risen to between 40 and 50 'gunmen,' though their connection to the new Syrian army remains unclear. The report also confirms the deaths of seven Lebanese civilians. Exact casualty figures couldn't be independently verified amid conflicting reports from both sides. The clashes are taking place in a region northeast of Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, an area predominantly inhabited by Shiite communities that are closely associated with Hezbollah. The Lebanese terrorist group was a key ally of the Assad regime and provided significant support during Syria's 14-year civil war. Since the fall of the regime, which was brought down by a surprise offensive led by jihadists and coincided with Israel's military pressure on Hezbollah, tensions with Syrian forces loyal to al-Sharaa have intensified. During Assad's rule, the western Syrian border served as a corridor for drugs and arms trafficking facilitated by Hezbollah and loyalists. The area is home to both legal and illegal crossings, which have facilitated the smuggling operations. Israel, aiming to disrupt the supply routes to Hezbollah from Iran, attacked these crossings during the war. The collapse of the Assad regime dealt a significant blow to Hezbollah's smuggling network, and last month, al-Sharaa's regime launched an operation to curb smuggling activities. The Syria-Lebanon border stretches approximately 375 kilometers (230 miles), with large stretches lacking clear demarcation. This geographical and demographic overlap is particularly pronounced around the Qusayr region and the western countryside of Homs, where many Lebanese citizens reside within Syrian territory. According to a report by the Arabic-language Independent, the total population of these villages is estimated at 10,000 people. Many villagers own agricultural lands on the Syrian side, further tying them to the area. While sporadic clashes have been reported in recent weeks, tensions boiled over on Sunday. Syria's defense ministry issued a statement accusing Hezbollah operatives of killing three Syrian soldiers and abducting them into Lebanon. Hezbollah denied the allegations. A Lebanese security official told Reuters that the Syrian soldiers were killed only after crossing into Lebanon and were shot by locals who feared their community was under attack. Fighting has persisted despite Lebanese Defense Minister Michel Mnassa and Syrian counterpart Marahaf Abu Qasra announcing a ceasefire on Monday. According to the Lebanese newspaper Al-Joumhouria, around 35,000 Lebanese have been internally displaced to areas including Hermel, the Bekaa Valley and Beirut. Despite ongoing communication between the Syrian and Lebanese defense ministries, clashes along the border persist, forcing the Lebanese army to mobilize forces on both the southern and eastern fronts. A political source told Al-Joumhouria that small groups of unknown affiliation have been 'kidnapping, looting and burning homes indiscriminately in the border area with Syria.' The source suggested these groups may include foreign fighters, referencing the fact that many jihadist rebels in Hayat Tahrir al-Sham—al-Sharaa's former militia, which was officially dissolved and integrated into Syria's security forces—are Muslim combatants who traveled from other countries to join the Syrian civil war. > Lebanese army forces recently arrived in the disputed village of Khush al-Said Ali, where they were met with hostility from locals who accused the military of betrayal. According to a report by Hezbollah-aligned Lebanese network Al Mayadeen, Syrian gunmen set fire to civilian homes in the village. A convoy of approximately 60 Lebanese army vehicles was deployed there, but a video broadcast by Lebanon's Al-Jadeed TV showed villagers chanting in support of slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and calling the army 'traitors.' Al-Akhbar reported that, under the ceasefire agreement, Syrian gunmen are expected to withdraw from the Lebanese part of Khush al-Said Ali, while the Lebanese army will patrol the area without establishing permanent checkpoints due to its contested status. Additionally, the bodies of two Lebanese civilians allegedly killed by Syrian gunmen in the Syrian village of al-Fadliya were reportedly returned through the Jousieh border crossing on Tuesday in exchange for the bodies of two Syrian fighters. The Lebanese army is reportedly bolstering its presence along the border and has formulated a plan to manage the situation in 22 villages considered to be the 'contact line.' On Tuesday, Al Mayadeen reported that a shell fell near a Lebanese army position in Khush al-Said Ali, prompting the army to respond to the source of the fire. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, addressing the escalating violence, stated that he instructed the army to retaliate against any aggression from Syria. 'What is happening along the eastern and northeastern borders cannot continue,' Aoun declared. He issued another statement on Wednesday demanding the implementation of the ceasefire and tighter control over the border region. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj4mv8ohke	2025-03-19T08:32:40-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/19/BkJ7yE00n1l/BkJ7yE00n1l_1_62_1000_563_0_small.jpg
2 UN workers killed in Gaza; Hamas blames Israel, IDF denies	After Hamas claimed UN worker killed in Israeli strike in Deir al-Balah, military denies attacking area; UN official later reports 2 mine clearance workers killed but did not attribute attack to Israel or Hamas A day after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) resumed operations in Gaza, Hamas claimed on Wednesday afternoon that an international UN staff member was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a UN facility in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza. Later, a UN official told AFP that two UN employees had been killed in the strike. According to the report, both victims were part of a United Nations Mine Action Service demining team. The AFP report did not attribute responsibility for the strike to either the IDF or Hamas. However, Hamas accused the IDF of carrying out the attack, claiming six UN workers were injured. In response, the IDF said that, contrary to Hamas' claims, it had not targeted any UN facility. Prior to Hamas' announcement, the Palestinian Shehab News Agency reported that five UN staff members were wounded in what it described as an Israeli strike and were transported to a hospital in Deir al-Balah. Hamas later stated that six UN workers had been injured and that one had died from his wounds. Qatar-based Al Araby TV added that the individuals were members of the UN's mine-clearing team. Images from Gaza showed UNMAS staff being transported to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. 'These premises were well known by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and they were ‘deconflicted’,' said, UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) Executive Director Jorge Moreira da Silva, explaining that 'everyone knew who was working inside the premises – it was UN personnel, UNOPS personnel.' He added that: 'UN personnel and its premises must be protected by all sides. The civilian population relies on the UN for lifesaving assistance, they are an essential lifeline at the time of utter tragedy and devastation.' He said that Israeli airstrikes had previously targeted the area when fighting resumed and that the site was directly hit again on Wednesday. 'After the first strike, we contacted the Israeli military and confirmed they knew we were there,' he added. Meanwhile, the IDF said it had struck a Hamas battalion headquarters overnight, along with dozens of terrorists and rocket launch sites. 'The battalion headquarters of the Hamas terrorist organization in Daraj Tuffah was targeted. Numerous terrorist operations against Israeli civilians and IDF troops were planned there,' the military said in a statement. > Additionally, the IDF and Shin Bet confirmed that Yasser Mohammed Harb Musa, the head of security in Hamas’ political bureau and director of the movement's development office, was killed during the renewed fighting. 'Musa was involved in planning and directing terrorist activities against Israel and was closely connected to Hamas leadership, including Yahya Sinwar,' the statement read. The IDF and Shin Bet also confirmed the death of Mohammad al-Jamassi, head of Hamas' emergency committee in Gaza. 'Al-Jamassi held key positions in Hamas’ political bureau and leadership and played a central role in governing the Gaza Strip and directing terror plots against Israel,' the military said. Reports from Gaza claimed that 29 people had been killed in Israeli strikes since Wednesday morning, including casualties in Beit Lahia and the Sabra neighborhood of Gaza City. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1no0uo31l	2025-03-19T07:54:30-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/19/HkJh3Qdhyg/HkJh3Qdhyg_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Troops regain control of key areas along Netzarim Corridor, Golani Brigade deployed to southern sector and remains on standby for further orders, military says; 'What comes next will be far worse,' Katz warns The IDF announced on Wednesday it expanded ground operations in central and southern Gaza over the past 24 hours, aiming to broaden security zones and create a partial buffer between northern and southern Gaza. As part of the operation, IDF forces regained control of key areas along the Netzarim Corridor, the military said. Additionally, the Golani Brigade has been deployed to the southern sector and remains on standby for further operations in Gaza. The IDF reiterated that it will continue targeting terrorist groups in the enclave to protect Israeli citizens. Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a warning in Hebrew to Gaza’s residents, saying, 'This is your final warning.' He compared Hamas military leader Mohammed Sinwar to his brother and past leader Yahya Sinwar who, in his words, 'destroyed Gaza,' warning that Sinwar’s actions would now 'lead to its total devastation.' 'The Air Force strikes on Hamas terrorists was only the first step,' Katz said. 'What comes next will be far worse, and you will pay the full price.' He also signaled that a renewed civilian evacuation from combat zones would begin soon. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'If all Israeli hostages are not released and Hamas is not removed from Gaza, Israel will act with unprecedented force,' Katz warned. 'Take the advice of the U.S. president—release the hostages and expel Hamas, and other options will open, including relocation for those who choose it. The alternative is total destruction.' Earlier, IDF forces blocked the Tancher-Salah al-Din Road in the Netzarim area, south of Gaza City, for the first time since the ceasefire began. The route had been a key passage for Gazans returning north by vehicle. However, movement southward remains open, as does the coastal Al-Rashid Road, allowing pedestrian access to northern Gaza. The move is seen as additional pressure on Hamas and Gaza’s population, aiming to prevent further infiltration of militants from the south after thousands of fighters crossed northward following the IDF’s withdrawal from the Netzarim corridor six weeks ago. Gazans reported that Israeli tanks had advanced into the area, halting vehicle movement along the blocked route. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk11ggpdnye	2025-03-19T07:25:04-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/19/SJXOaaLOnye/SJXOaaLOnye_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Still rents, rides public transit: How billionaire CEO Assaf Rapp...	Despite Wiz’s $32B Google acquisition, Rappaport lives modestly, renting an apartment and commuting by public transit; known for his bold leadership and activism, he’s redefining success in high-tech while staying true to his values Eight months after negotiations collapsed and shattered Israelis' dreams of the biggest exit in the country's history, the deal has been finalized—Google has officially announced the acquisition of Israeli cybersecurity giant Wiz in a deal estimated at about $32 billion, $9 billion more than the amount discussed in the previous round. This is the largest acquisition ever of an Israeli company and also the largest acquisition ever made by Alphabet-Google. In the previous round, Google had offered to buy the company for $23 billion, but after much excitement, Wiz decided to forgo the merger. In a statement issued by CEO and co-founder Assaf Rappaport, he explained that his plan was to turn Wiz into 'the best cybersecurity company in the world' and achieve annual revenues of $1 billion. 'Although we are flattered by the offers we received, we chose to continue our path to building Wiz,' he wrote to employees. Assaf Rappaport: The rising star of Israeli high-tech Assaf Rappaport, 41, is one of the hottest names in Israeli high-tech. A decade ago, he made an exit worth $320 million, became the youngest CEO of Microsoft Israel at the age of 34, and now his name is associated with the largest exit in local high-tech history. According to estimates, Rappaport holds about 10% of Wiz's shares, which means he could pocket $3.2 billion before taxes. Despite his immense success, Rappaport leads a modest lifestyle. He has lived for over a decade in a rented apartment in an old building in central Tel Aviv, doesn’t own a private car and gets around on foot or by public transportation, often accompanied by his dog, Mika. Friends describe him as someone who values simplicity and convenience over material possessions. For example, he prefers public transportation over owning a car due to the challenges of parking in his area. While he could easily afford a more luxurious lifestyle, he chooses what suits him best. However, Rappaport does indulge in certain luxuries. He always flies business class and spends money on experiences he enjoys, such as traveling the world and attending concerts. For instance, he once bought multiple tickets to a Beyoncé concert abroad and invited all his friends. He is known for being surrounded by friends and enjoying life to the fullest. Rappaport is known for his unconventional management style. He interacts with employees on an equal footing, often wearing jeans, sneakers and a t-shirt. He doesn’t shy away from taking breaks during the workday, whether to nap in the office or play ball with Mika. He has a penchant for junk food, avoids greens and is an avid podcast listener, particularly enjoying celebrity chef Ruthie Brodo's podcast. Colleagues describe him as someone uninterested in material wealth and who avoids bars and clubs. Origin story Rappaport is considered one of the most brilliant and creative minds to emerge from Israeli high-tech. He spent his IDF service in elite intelligence units 81 and 8200. After his discharge from the military, he worked for American consulting giant McKinsey but quickly realized he had a different calling. In 2012, he co-founded Adallom with his friends from his military service—Ami Luttwak, Yinon Costica and Roy Reznik. The startup, which developed cloud-based information security technology, began in a small room in a Tel Aviv apartment and was sold to Microsoft for $320 million within three years. Adallom's acquisition remains a cornerstone of Microsoft’s successful cloud division. Rappaport later became the CEO of Microsoft Israel’s R&D center. After four and a half years—a long tenure by his standards—he left unexpectedly to establish Wiz with his three partners. > Rappaport’s parents divorced when he was a child, and his mother, Tzipi, raised him alone. Friends say he speaks with her multiple times a day, and she is immensely proud of him, collecting every article and publication about him. Rappaport came out as gay at a young age and has been in a relationship for years with Ophir, a former educator and current high-tech worker. He was the first CEO in Israel to announce surrogacy grants for both gay and straight couples. He is also outspoken about his political views, actively participating in protests against the government's controversial judicial reform push. He even declared that Wiz would move funds out of Israel, leaving only what was necessary for salaries and operations. Wiz: A rising star in cybersecurity Wiz was founded in a competitive and crowded field, with many players, including several Israeli companies. Its product offers organizations a comprehensive solution for securing their cloud environments. This is precisely what attracted Google, which has lagged behind competitors like Microsoft and Amazon in its cloud division. Founded just four years ago, Wiz employs about 1,200 people in Israel and the U.S. Its clients include major companies like Colgate-Palmolive and BMW. Among its investors are Howard Schultz, founder of Starbucks, and French billionaire Bernard Arnault, who briefly overtook Elon Musk as the world’s richest person. Each of Wiz’s four founders holds an equal 10% share: Rappaport serves as CEO, Costica as chief product officer, Luttwak as chief technology officer and Reznik as chief development officer. Despite Rappaport’s prominent role as the company’s frontman, decisions at Wiz are reportedly made collectively by the four founders, each having an equal vote. This collaborative approach has so far prevented conflicts often seen in similar high-profile ventures. Rappaport has often cited entrepreneurs like Nir Zuk of Palo Alto Networks and Gil Shwed of Check Point as his role models—leaders who didn’t seek quick exits but instead aimed to build global companies. He has previously stated, 'If someone is looking to buy us, don’t bother calling.' However, sources close to Rappaport say he wrestled with the decision between selling to Google and pursuing an independent IPO to fulfill his dream of making Wiz the world’s largest cybersecurity company. Ultimately, the decision wasn’t solely up to Rappaport and his partners. Venture capital funds and investors behind Wiz saw Google’s offer as a rare opportunity to secure significant returns without the risks associated with a public offering. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/syxoybd2kg	2025-03-19T07:12:56-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/18/rkND300uI00A/rkND300uI00A_0_72_1600_901_0_small.jpg

Government may oust Shin Bet chief by Thursday, AG next week	Decision comes following reinstatement of Itamar Ben-Gvir as national security minister; Deliberations on firing Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara planned for Sunday The government is set to convene a Cabinet meeting on Thursday to discuss Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar's dismissal. Following a meeting Tuesday regarding the reinstatement of Otzma Yehudit party ministers, consultations were held on potentially holding the session to approve Bar’s dismissal, with plans to leave deliberations on firing Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara for Sunday. On Tuesday night, Baharav-Miara informed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that as long as the 'Qatar-Gate' investigation—implicating staff in his office—is ongoing, it is questionable whether he can legally convene the Cabinet to dismiss Bar. She added that Netanyahu would, in any case, be required to obtain the recommendation of the Advisory Committee for Senior Appointments to approve Bar’s dismissal. Therefore, according to Baharav-Miara, the planned cabinet session to discuss firing the Shin Bet head cannot be held. > Against the backdrop of renewed fighting in Gaza, which Bar has overseen alongside IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, the Cabinet did not deliberate Bar’s removal during Tuesday’s meeting. However, ministers unanimously voted to reinstate Itamar Ben-Gvir as national security minister, pending Knesset approval, despite the attorney general’s strong opposition. This suggests Baharav-Miara may not be able to halt the discussion on Bar’s dismissal on her own. Nevertheless, any decision to remove Bar is likely to face immediate petitions to Israel’s High Court of Justice, which could block the move. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar, who appointed Baharav-Miara to her current role and recently rejoined the Likud party, criticized her during the meeting. 'We’ve never seen anything like this,' he said, referring to her opposition to Ben-Gvir’s return to office. 'In trying to find a fitting comparison for her eagerness to harm the government, I thought of the kamikaze pilots of World War II who crashed themselves into enemy targets. What we are seeing here is the self-destruction of the Attorney General’s Office in its zeal to strike at the government.' Sa'ar further questioned Baharav-Miara’s justification for opposing Ben-Gvir’s reappointment. 'Even barring an appointment due to an indictment reflects an activist interpretation of the law’s clear language. Now there’s not even an indictment. Apparently, there’s a new reason: 'It just doesn’t sit well with her.’' Ben-Gvir set three conditions for his return to the government: the dismissal of the Shin Bet chief, the firing of the attorney general and a resumption of military operations in Gaza. All three are now underway, but completing the dismissals still requires overcoming legal petitions and approval by the Advisory Committee for Senior Appointments in both cases. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk7rirun1g	2025-03-19T06:03:21-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/19/SJdzwEO2ke/SJdzwEO2ke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

I'm not okay until all hostages return': Freed IDF lookout says ...	Karina Ariev, freed after 477 days in Hamas captivity, refuses to accept freedom until all 59 remaining hostages are rescued, rejects the 'heroine' label and urges national unity Karina Ariev, a 20-year-old from Jerusalem’s Pisgat Ze’ev neighborhood, is one of seven female soldiers abducted from the Nahal Oz military base during Hamas’ October 7 attack. After spending 477 days in captivity in Gaza, she was released and is now speaking out about her experience, the ongoing trauma, and her mission to ensure that the remaining hostages are not forgotten. 'My condition is much better than it was a month and a half ago, that’s clear,' Ariev said in a special interview as part of the 'Heroines of the Nation' project. 'But unfortunately, I can’t say that I’m okay. I won’t be until all 59 hostages return.' Ariev, who was serving as a military lookout at the time of the attack, described the horrors of captivity—being held in the dark, suffering through the cold, and enduring harsh treatment by her captors. She recalled the moment of her release as 'getting my freedom back.' Since her return, she has been a vocal advocate for those still in captivity, including speaking at a rally in Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square. 'My role now is to keep fighting until all my brothers and sisters who were kidnapped also regain their freedom,' she said. > During the interview, Ariev sent a direct message in English to former U.S. President Donald Trump, urging continued efforts to bring the hostages home. She also addressed her fellow captives in Arabic: 'I and so many others are fighting for you. We will bring you back. We will never forget you.' Life after October 7 Before the attack, Ariev was a typical 19-year-old soldier. 'Life was really good,' she recalled. 'I had my friends from the army, my friends from home. We would dance, cook, make TikTok videos. Everything felt perfect.' That life was shattered at 6:29 a.m. on October 7, when Hamas terrorists stormed her base. Ariev and several other soldiers sought shelter in a reinforced room, but the attackers threw grenades inside, injuring them before taking them hostage. They were dragged, barefoot and wounded, into Gaza, where they remained in captivity for nearly a year and a half. Since her return, Ariev has struggled to process what happened. 'I don’t see myself as a heroine,' she said. 'I still can’t fully grasp what I went through.' Instead, she sees her mother and sister as the true heroes, praising them for their relentless fight to bring her home. But she also honors another group of heroines: 'The 22 women from my base in Nahal Oz who were murdered on October 7. They are not just my personal heroes—they should be heroes for all of Israel and the entire world.' Holding onto unity and hope Ariev’s best friend, Aviv Hajaj, was one of those killed in the attack. 'She was an incredible person—humble, kind, with strong values. Everyone who met her was drawn to her,' Ariev said. 'I still talk about her in the present tense. There’s no such thing as speaking about her in the past. She’s with me until the end.' Despite the trauma, Ariev remains committed to the fight for the hostages and to preserving the unity she believes is critical for Israel’s strength. 'I think what keeps us going is hope—the belief that in the end, things will be okay,' she said. 'That’s what makes you strong. That’s what helps you survive.' She urged Israelis to hold onto that unity: 'It’s not just a cliché. It’s what enables us to overcome everything and come out stronger. It’s so important to protect that.' Ariev’s battle is far from over, but she remains determined. 'Right now, I don’t really have any dreams,' she admitted. 'I just want to slowly return to normal, to see everyone come home, and to somehow begin to heal from this trauma that we are still living through every day.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sy8nm1ohje	2025-03-19T02:35:09-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/18/rykrmkwhJe/rykrmkwhJe_273_38_1389_782_0_small.jpg

In the post, he wrote that 'the thing that will most help protect my people now is to refuse to take part in the fighting in the service of a bunch of filthy traitors and in complete opposition to the interests of the people of Israel.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj00y00gdnke	2025-03-19T02:21:10-07:00	
Enough! We won’t let them destroy our country': Thousands march ...	Protest leaders condemn dismissal of the Shin Bet chief, risking hostages in renewed war - claiming political motivation; opposition figures urge nationwide action, as university chiefs join strike Thousands of demonstrators marched Wednesday morning from the Motza Interchange to a central protest near the government complex in Jerusalem, temporarily blocking Highway 1 between the starting point and the Sacharov Interchange. Additionally, large numbers of protesters were seen at the city's train station, making their way to the rally. Later, demonstrators planned to march toward Azza Street, where the prime minister's residence is located. The protest, led by activists opposing the dismissal of Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and what they call the 'abandonment of the hostages,' began with a press statement in Motza. Lt. Col. (res.) Oren Shboul, a leader in the Brothers in Arms protest movement, criticized the government’s decision-making during wartime. 'At a time when all fronts are escalating, the government and its leader are trying to fire the head of the Shin Bet,' Shboul said. 'Just a week after issuing 400,000 emergency call-up orders to reservists, after they have already served for a year and a half across all fronts, the so-called defense minister is dancing at an event for draft dodgers and promising them from every stage that they will not be enlisted.' He also condemned the government’s handling of hostages held by Hamas, saying: 'While the entire country holds its breath in fear for their fate, last night the government reinstated the very person who boasted about thwarting previous hostage deals, the one who long ago gave up on them and is essentially leaving them to die in Gaza. Add to that the judicial overhaul making a comeback with full force. We, the patriotic Israeli public that serves this country, must put an end to this madness and restore sanity before there is nothing left to save.' Activist Yaya Fink added: 'The attorney general and the head of the Shin Bet will not be fired. What we are doing here is civilian reserve duty. The prime minister has launched a 'war for his seat,' while we are fighting for Israeli democracy and for the lives of our brothers and sisters abandoned in Hamas captivity. This is not what our parents built the Jewish state for. This is our generation’s struggle, and we have no choice but to protect the gatekeepers and prevail.' Shikma Bressler, another protest leader, referenced Tuesday night’s mass demonstration in Tel Aviv, where former senior security officials spoke. 'The picture is clear,' she said. 'This government—one that calls Hamas an asset, a government propped up by Qatari interests—is endangering Israel’s security. This is no longer just about democracy; it's about our security. They are sacrificing the hostages and reinstating the very person who proudly sabotaged a hostage deal, someone with no real interest in bringing them home. It’s time to put an end to this insanity before there is no one left to save.' Opposition leader Yair Lapid urged Israelis to join the protests, calling for demonstrations in support of returning the hostages, equal military service obligations, a democratic and liberal Israel, and the establishment of a state commission of inquiry. 'This government does not stop at red lines,' Lapid said. 'The only solution is unity—not silent unity, not submissive unity, not fake unity, but the unity of an entire nation coming together and saying: 'Enough.' We will not break the law, we will continue to serve, but we will stand firm against a government that is trying to dismantle the country.' The protests also extended to academia. Faculty members from Tel Aviv University and deans from the Hebrew University announced a strike in solidarity. Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem also declared its participation, with faculty members planning to march to the Knesset at 1 pm Prof. Avishai Gal-Yam, dean of the physics faculty at the Weizmann Institute, said he, too, would join the demonstrations in Jerusalem, telling ynetnews that 'academic freedom is under constant attack, and we are witnessing a brain drain as people leave the country due to the situation.' Meanwhile, retired Brig. Gen. Amir Haskel, a prominent anti-government activist, was arrested in Jerusalem near the prime minister’s residence. According to the protest movement’s legal support team, Haskel was giving a speech via megaphone when police detained him during a live broadcast on Facebook and took him to the city’s Moriah police station. Against the backdrop of renewed fighting in Gaza, Bressler stated that the protests would continue as planned. 'If there is a security escalation, then the prime minister should certainly not be firing the head of the Shin Bet, should not be pushing forward a judicial overhaul, and should not be further undermining Israel’s security.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skk7kz00hyx	2025-03-19T01:31:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/19/BJ11H1111uh1e/BJ11H1111uh1e_0_133_1280_721_0_small.jpg
I'm not okay until all hostages return': Freed IDF lookout says ...	Karina Ariev, freed after 477 days in Hamas captivity, refuses to accept freedom until all 59 remaining hostages are rescued, rejects the 'heroine' label and urges national unity Former Israeli hostage Karina Ariev, an IDF lookout who was held hostage by Hamas for over 470 days, said she won’t feel truly free until all remaining captives are released. Speaking as part of Israel’s 'Heroines of the Nation' project, Ariev stressed that her personal struggle continues as long as 59 hostages remain in Gaza. 'I can’t tell you that I’m okay until all 59 hostages return home, until we know they are safe,' she said. Ariev, who was stationed at the Nahal Oz base during Hamas' October 7 attack, rejected the label of 'heroine' for herself. Instead, she honored her mother and sister for their relentless advocacy during her captivity and paid tribute to 22 female soldiers from her base who were killed in the assault. Among them was her best friend, Aviv Hajaj. 'She was such a wonderful girl. She came from a home with strong values. She was humble and modest,' Ariev said. 'I still talk about her in the present tense. I can’t bring myself to speak about her in the past.' Reflecting on her life before the attack, Ariev described herself as an ordinary 19-year-old who spent time with friends, danced, cooked and made social media videos. Now, she said, her only focus is on healing and seeing the remaining hostages return.

'I just want to slowly return to my routine, to see everyone come back and to begin overcoming this trauma, which we are still experiencing to this day.' Ariev also said she feels a responsibility to amplify the voices of those still in captivity, urging continued action for their release. 'This struggle is important to me. It’s important that this isn’t forgotten,' she said. When asked about the strength of women, Ariev pointed to faith, hope and resilience as defining traits. 'The belief that in the end, things will be okay — that’s what makes you strong, helps you survive,' she said. She also called for national unity, saying it is essential for overcoming hardship. 'As the people of Israel, we truly need to be united, together. This unity is what allows us to win, to emerge stronger from everything, and to overcome anything.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy8nm1ohje	2025-03-19T01:28:27-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/18/rykrmkwhJe/rykrmkwhJe_273_38_1389_782_0_small.jpg

Iraqi naval forces have seized an unidentified ship in Iraqi territorial waters in the Gulf suspected of smuggling fuel, the naval forces said in a statement. Fuel smuggling is common in Gulf waters, where heavily subsidized fuel from some countries is sold on the black market to buyers across the region, though it is relatively rare for Iraqi authorities to seize ships. A naval patrol boat intercepted the ship on Tuesday after receiving intelligence about suspected illegal activity, according to the navy statement issued late on Tuesday.

Amine Ayoub, fellow at Middle East Forum, says Syrian leader remains security threat despite rebranding; defends Israel’s decision to renew strikes in Gaza, arguing that Hamas cannot be negotiated with Amine Ayoub, a fellow at the Middle East Forum, cautioned Israel against trusting Syria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, citing his past as a jihadist leader and warning that his shift toward moderation is a strategic deception. Sharaa, who was previously known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, led Jabhat al-Nusra, an al-Qaeda affiliate, before rebranding it as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Despite now positioning himself as a statesman, Ayoub argued that Sharaa’s past cannot be ignored and that his leadership still poses a security threat. 'This sudden change is suspicious,' Ayoub said. 'You can’t go from being an al-Qaeda affiliate to a protector of human rights overnight.' He pointed to the concept of taqiyya, a term used to describe religiously sanctioned deception, which he said Islamist groups employ to consolidate power. Despite his rebranding, Ayoub warned that Sharaa’s leadership remains a concern for Israel. 'Recent reports indicate that more than a thousand people, including Alawites and other minorities, have been killed in Syria,' Ayoub said. 'This regime continues to pose a serious danger.' Ayoub emphasized the importance of Israel maintaining vigilance, particularly regarding developments on the Syrian front. 'There is growing discussion about Israel’s position, especially in the Golan Heights,' he said. 'It is critical for Israel to remain cautious and ensure its security.' Gaza conflict and Hamas Ayoub also addressed the ongoing conflict in Gaza, where Israel resumed airstrikes after cease-fire talks failed. He defended Israel’s decision, arguing that Hamas cannot be negotiated with. 'The first cease-fire ended weeks ago, yet not all hostages were released,' he said. 'I’m pleased Israel resumed its operations because negotiating with terrorists is futile.' Ayoub criticized what he sees as the increasing normalization of Hamas in parts of the Western world. 'Some leftist groups and Islamist factions seem to forget that Hamas is a terrorist organization,' he said. 'Before any discussion about Gaza’s future, Hamas must be dismantled.' > He also dismissed an Egyptian-led proposal that did not directly address Hamas’ role. 'Any plan for Gaza must start with removing Hamas,' he said. Israel’s regional challenges Ayoub was skeptical about whether Israel could rely on the United States and other countries to prevent threats from Iran, Hamas, and the Houthis. He argued that dismantling Hamas would send a strong message to Israel’s adversaries. 'If Israel takes firm action against Hamas, it will serve as a warning to Iran, the Houthis, and other regional threats,' he said.

Turkey detains Erdogan's main rival in what opposition calls 'cou...	Move against Ekrem Imamoglu, popular mayor of Istanbul, appears to cap aggressive months-long legal crackdown on opposition figures; government blocks social media to prevent protests Turkish authorities detained President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's main political rival on Wednesday on charges including corruption and aiding a terrorist group, in what the main opposition party called 'a coup attempt against our next president'. The move against Ekrem Imamoglu, the popular mayor of Istanbul, appears to cap an aggressive months-long legal crackdown on opposition figures across the country which has been criticized as a politicized attempt to silence dissent. Erdogan's government denies the charges and says the judiciary is independent. It is meanwhile pressing to end a decades-long insurgency by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) after its jailed leader called for disarmament last month. Imamoglu, 54, who leads Erdogan in some opinion polls, faces two separate investigations that also include charges of leading a crime organization, bribery and tender rigging. TV footage showed him fixing his tie and preparing to leave his home for detention on Wednesday morning. The main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) was poised within days to name the two-term mayor its official presidential challenger to Erdogan, who has run Turkey for more than two decades. The next election is set for 2028, but Erdogan has reached his two-term limit as president, after having earlier served as prime minister. If he wishes to run for the presidency again he must call an early election and claim he had not finished his second term or change the constitution. In a video he shared on social media, Imamoglu said he would not give up and would continue standing straight in the face of pressure. CHP leader Ozgur Ozel called the detention a coup attempt and called all opposition groups to unite against it. The party will go ahead and select Imamoglu as leader on Sunday irrespective, he added. According to a statement by the Istanbul prosecutor's office on the first investigation, a total of 100 people including journalists and businessmen are suspected of being involved in criminal activities related to certain tenders awarded by the municipality. It said that a second investigation charged Imamoglu and six others with aiding the PKK, which is deemed a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies. Last month, the PKK declared a ceasefire in response to jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan's call for disarmament, marking a big step toward ending an insurgency that has left more than 40,000 dead, and that could have regional security and political ramifications. > Imamoglu's detention came a day after Istanbul University annulled Imamoglu's degree, which if upheld would block him from running in presidential elections. The Istanbul governor's office banned all meetings and protests in the city for four days. The widening legal crackdown includes numerous indictments and the appointments of several government trustees to opposition-held municipal positions. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkloog00nyg	2025-03-19T00:15:56-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/21/HkG4Ldq000/HkG4Ldq000_0_85_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Hamas rejects ceasefire talks as Israel continues strikes in Gaza	Terror group official warns Israeli attacks would kill hostages; Military warns residents of Khan Younis to leave for their safety ahead of attack, says targeted Hamas terrorists preparing rocket fire A senior Hamas official told Saudi news outlet Asharq News that the terror group is not seeking new ceasefire negotiations, arguing that Israel should instead adhere to past agreements. 'The movement has not closed the door on negotiations but there is no need for new agreements given the existing one that all parties signed,' he said. The official warned that continued Israeli attacks on Gaza would result in 'the killing of many Israeli hostages.' IDF intensifies Gaza strikes, warns civilians to evacuate The IDF struck Hamas terrorists in northern Gaza on Wednesday after they were preparing to launch rockets at Israel, the military said. earlier the IDF dropped leaflets warning residents of Khan Younis to immediately, evacuate to safety ahead of an attack. The leaflets warned of a 'strong attack to dismantle terrorist organizations' and directed civilians to known shelters in the Khan Younis, according to Palestinian reports. Palestinian media reported heavy artillery shelling in the Zeitoun neighborhood of Gaza City, as well as airstrikes in the eastern part of Rafah. Attack helicopters reportedly targeted the Al-Geneina area in the south, while additional attacks were carried out from military vehicles in eastern Gaza City. Major strikes eliminate Hamas, Islamic Jihad leaders The IDF launched a surprise wave of airstrikes Tuesday overnight targeting more than 80 sites within 10 minutes. Palestinian reports indicated widespread destruction, including strikes in the designated humanitarian zone west of Khan Younis, al-Bureij in central Gaza, Rafah and the Shuja'iyya neighborhood. Senior figures in Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad were among those killed, including Hamas' de facto prime minister, two government ministers and the Islamic Jihad spokesperson. Palestinian sources reported hundreds of casualties. IDF officials acknowledged concerns regarding the safety of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza, saying, 'We can't be 100% certain but the chief of staff has given explicit orders to take all precautions to avoid harming hostages.' Hezbollah outlet warns of wider conflict As fighting in Gaza intensifies, Hezbollah-aligned Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar published a report claiming Israel aims to expand the war across multiple fronts. The article claimed that Israel remains dissatisfied with its progress in Gaza and intends to continue military operations in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and potentially Iran. It alleged that intelligence cooperation between Israel and the U.S. is focused on preparing for direct strikes if necessary. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The report also cited Israeli efforts to undermine Yemen's Houthis and the Iranian regime, saying, 'Israel sees eliminating the Iranian threat as the key to dismantling the entire 'Axis of Resistance.'' Houthis vow renewed attacks on Israel The Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Akhbar newspaper in Lebanon quoted military sources in Sanaa who claimed that Yemen's Houthis have received directives to escalate operations against Israel in response to the renewed fighting in Gaza. The sources suggested that future attacks could be coordinated with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Late Monday, the Houthis claimed responsibility for launching a missile toward Israel and said they had targeted the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Harry Truman for the fourth time in 72 hours. Yemeni media reported at least 10 U.S. airstrikes on various locations in Yemen shortly before the Houthis' announcement.

Qatar-Gate': Israeli businessman says he transferred money from ...	Gil Birger heard in recording saying long-time friend Jay Footnik, registered as agent for Qatar in the U.S., asked him to deliver the money to Eli Feldstein, citing tax reasons An Israeli businessman has admitted to transferring money from a lobbyist for the Qatari government to a spokesperson in the Prime Minister’s Office, raising new questions about foreign influence and financial dealings within the Israeli government. Gil Birger, an Israeli businessman operating in the Gulf, said in a recording aired Wednesday on public broadcaster Kan radio that he transferred the funds at the request of the lobbyist, citing tax considerations. 'He asked for my help due to VAT matters. I’ve known him for 25 years,' Birger said. The lobbyist, identified as Jay Footlik, who is registered in the U.S. as an agent of Qatar, reportedly transferred the money to Birger, who then paid Eli Feldstein, a spokesperson in the Prime Minister’s Office, while Feldstein was still in the role. According to a report on Israel’s Channel 13, the government stopped paying Feldstein’s salary in April after he was denied security clearance by the Shin Bet security agency. Despite this, he continued working in the office as the spokesperson for military affairs. Birger insisted that Footlik—not he—had employed Feldstein. 'He worked with him for a few months. He hired him, not me,' Birger said. He also noted that he has a longstanding business agreement with Footlik on multiple matters. According to Kan, Birger claimed the work Footlik performed was related to 'the hostages.' Throughout the affair, Feldstein has denied working for the Qatari government, maintaining that his sole employer was the Prime Minister’s Office and that his superiors were the office’s official spokespersons. The ‘Qatar-Gate’ affair The case involves three communications officials linked to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: Feldstein, who has already been investigated and charged in a separate classified document leak case; Jonathan Urich, Netanyahu's close adviser and spokesperson also implicated in that leak investigation; and Israel Einhorn, a consultant who worked on Likud’s election campaigns. > Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara has authorized the Israel Police and the Shin Bet to investigate the case. Last week, a sweeping gag order was issued, barring publication of any details related to the investigation, including information on suspects, findings, or investigative actions. The case was being handled by the police’s National Fraud Investigation Unit under Lahav 433, Israel’s equivalent of the FBI. Before the attorney general’s decision to escalate the probe, authorities had been examining security breaches and counterintelligence concerns. However, the investigation reportedly uncovered potential criminal elements, leading to the Shin Bet’s involvement in questioning suspects under caution. According to reports, Feldstein was paid by a company to manage extensive public relations efforts aimed at improving Qatar’s image in Israel. His activities allegedly included coordinating interviews between Israeli journalists and senior Qatari officials, distributing official statements on Qatar’s behalf, and promoting narratives about its role in regional diplomacy—all while serving in the Prime Minister’s Office. Meanwhile, Netanyahu has openly criticized Qatar, accusing it of 'serving Hamas' even as it mediated negotiations over Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Urich and Einhorn have also been linked to Qatari public relations efforts. In 2022, the two reportedly ran an Israeli media campaign for Qatar ahead of the FIFA World Cup, aiming to present the Gulf nation—which has long been accused of financing terror groups—as a legitimate and stabilizing force in the region. In a mass protest event in Tel Aviv on Tuesday, former senior members of Israel's security services accused Netanyahu of attempting to foil the investigation into his staff's involvement with Qatar, including by firing Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bko67juhkg	2025-03-18T23:02:53-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/r1rAKDiFJe/r1rAKDiFJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

US strikes target areas in Yemen, Houthi media reports	Rebel army spokesperson says at least 10 strikes targeted areas in Yemen, claims Houthi targeted US carrier USS Harry S. Truman and other warships with missiles and drones At least 10 U.S. strikes targeted areas in Yemen, including Saada province and Hodeidah, Yemen's Houthi media reported early on Wednesday. The U.S. launched a wave of strikes in areas of Yemen controlled by the Iran-aligned Houthis, who said last week they were resuming attacks on Red Sea shipping to support Palestinians in Gaza. Houthi forces detected hostile military movements in the Red Sea in preparation for launching a large-scale air attack on the country, Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said on Wednesday. Sarea said, without offering evidence, that Houthis targeted the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman and other warships with missiles and drones, thwarting the U.S. attack. On Tuesday the rebel army launched what they claimed were two hypersonic missiles at Israel setting off air raid sirens across the south. The IDF confirmed that the Air Force intercepted a missile using the Arrow defense system before it entered Israeli airspace. 'A missile launched from Yemen was intercepted by the IAF prior to crossing into Israeli territory. Sirens were sounded in accordance with protocol,' the military said. Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree claimed responsibility for the launch, saying the group had fired a Palestine 2 hypersonic ballistic missile at Israel. 'If Israeli strikes in Gaza do not stop, we will expand our list of targets in Israel in the coming hours and days,' Saree warned.

Israel must prioritize hostage release over dismantling Hamas,' ...	Mike Herzog who served as ambassador to U.S. discusses missed opportunities for Saudi normalization, shifts in U.S. policy under Trump and strategies for Gaza, emphasizing freeing hostages should take precedence over toppling Hamas leadership Former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Mike Herzog discussed the evolving American policy under President Donald Trump in an interview with Ynet. He also discussed the new reality in the Middle East amidst a war that has lasted nearly a year and a half. In the interview, Herzog, who ended his term as ambassador two months ago, spoke about the missed opportunity for normalization with Saudi Arabia, addressed strategies regarding Iran, and clarified that the release of hostages takes priority over dismantling Hamas. The U.S. is conducting a military campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen, and President Donald Trump has issued threats toward Iran. How does this administration's policy differ from previous ones, particularly Joe Biden's? This is definitely a different approach compared to previous U.S. administrations. There has always been a defined 'red line' regarding the prevention of disruptions to international shipping routes. The previous administration responded militarily, but it did so sporadically, occasionally striking targets in Yemen. What’s different now is the scope and intensity. There’s a clear American campaign here, sending a message to the Houthis: 'This is a prolonged attack, and it won’t stop until you cease disrupting international trade routes.' The second component is a message to Iran, essentially saying, 'We know you’re behind the Houthis, so you bear responsibility and won’t escape it.' Trump’s earlier statements spoke of a potential agreement with Iran. Has the strategy shifted, or is this still a path toward an agreement? The strategy hasn’t changed. From my understanding, the Trump administration seeks an agreement with Iran to dismantle at least part of its nuclear capabilities. For now, Iran hasn’t responded, and I believe this is part of Trump’s approach to push Iran into negotiations. Trump once aimed for a Nobel Peace Prize, saying, 'I end wars, not start them.' Does he appear to be working toward expanding the Abraham Accords and normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel, or leaning toward conflict? A: His approach is based on 'peace out of strength,' meaning he seeks peace through demonstrating power. He threatens the use of force to push the other side into agreements. Sometimes it works, but not necessarily. The question arises: if it doesn’t work, what will the Trump administration do? If negotiations with Iran fail, what will the U.S. do? Will it give Israel the green light to attack, strike itself, or join forces with Israel? You said in interviews that Israel missed an opportunity for a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia during Biden’s administration. Why? There was interest from all three parties—Israel, the U.S., and Saudi Arabia—to reach a normalization agreement. It was built as part of a package that also included a defense alliance between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, which requires a two-thirds majority in the U.S. Senate. This effort stalled. Amid the war, the Saudis also wanted a ceasefire and a defined 'political horizon,' which, as we all know, is problematic and controversial for Israel. > Because of the war, this issue was postponed for many months. We resumed discussions toward the end of Biden's term, with the idea of pushing it through between November and January—the so-called 'Lame Duck' period in the U.S., when Biden could rally the necessary Democratic majority, and Republicans might vote in favor out of solidarity with Israel. Unfortunately, it didn’t succeed, which is a shame. I still believe this will happen, but it’s uncertain when. How could this happen under the current Israeli government? It’s clear that without defining a political horizon that involves two states and a path leading there, it won’t happen. This is a decision that any Israeli government will have to make. Do you think Trump will try to advance his vision for Gaza? Trump has a method he described in his book, The Art of the Deal. As someone who knows him well from the New York business world explained to me, he first throws a grenade into the room—then, under the shock, he starts negotiating and trying to extract concessions. When Trump said what he did about relocating people from Gaza, it doesn’t mean that’s the ultimate outcome. He’s pushing the Arab world to come up with its own proposal, which I don’t think would have happened without his initial ideas. Initially, it sounded like he was talking about forced relocation, but now it’s voluntary. That grenade he threw at the beginning was meant to spark dialogue, but it doesn’t mean it will actually happen. Was it a mistake for Israel to immediately embrace the idea? I understand where the Israeli intention came from, and I’ve heard there are already plans to establish a governing body to encourage Gazans to emigrate. But honestly, even if 200,000 people leave Gaza, as long as the majority remains—and they will—and as long as Hamas remains in power and prevents people from leaving freely, the dilemma persists. Sooner or later, we’ll have to make decisions about Gaza, particularly regarding the hostages. The first phase of the U.S.-brokered deal has been implemented. Does the Trump administration have the leverage to impose the 'Witkoff Framework' on Hamas? First, we need to define the framework. The Witkoff Framework is an attempt to bridge the gap between Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the original plan, buying time to rescue as many hostages as possible from Gaza. I sense some interest on the Hamas side, and we may be able to secure the release of additional hostages. But this won’t bring us all of them, as Hamas will only agree to their full release under the original Phase 2 framework negotiated with the U.S. and Israel. Sooner or later, even if we manage another one or two hostage releases, we’ll face a decision point: What takes priority—releasing the hostages or toppling Hamas in Gaza? My clear position is that Israel should prioritize the hostages’ release, and dismantling Hamas will have its time. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rybo74w31g	2025-03-18T21:00:24-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/13/ryZQdKjIUa/ryZQdKjIUa_0_95_1280_721_0_small.jpg

IDF will escalate operations in Gaza if needed'	Jonathan Conricus: Israel's military action in Gaza will be 'stronger, more decisive, more violent, more kinetic' than it was during the first 16 months of war If Hamas continues to refuse to release hostages, Israel will be forced to expand its military operation in the Gaza Strip, according to Jonathan Conricus, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a former IDF spokesperson. He told ILTV News that this escalation will include 'enhanced aerial attacks on Hamas infrastructure and targets, personnel and locations, and special forces and ground forces that will maneuver inside the Gaza Strip, searching for hostages and trying to launch hostage release operations and, of course, targeting Hamas, their senior leadership, their infrastructure, and really their centers of gravity.' Any new IDF operation, he said, will be a 'very different type of Israeli military action, not like what we've become accustomed to seeing' throughout the war. He described it as 'stronger, more decisive, more violent, more kinetic, and Israel will use many more tools at its disposal.'

Florida doctor leads mission to Israel, delivers $1 million in ai...	Dr. Steve Katz: 'We're all here for the same exact reason, which is to support our brothers and sisters in Israel with hugs, with love, with volunteering' A Florida emergency room physician recently led a Jewish National Fund-USA mission of 50 men to Israel, delivering approximately $1 million raised through grassroots community efforts. 'They are a really diverse group of guys who come from very different backgrounds and professions,' Dr. Steve Katz told ILTV News. 'But the bottom line is, we are all brothers … with a shared goal. We're all here for the same exact reason, which is to support our brothers and sisters in Israel with hugs, with love, with volunteering, and by donating as much money as possible to projects in the State of Israel.' What struck Katz the most during the mission was the overwhelming gratitude from the Israelis they met. While he had traveled to thank them for their resilience in maintaining the strength of the Jewish state during wartime, it was the Israelis who expressed their appreciation instead. 'The Israelis seem to feel the need to thank us for being here, which is so paradoxical for us because we feel like we're here to thank the people of Israel for everything they do,' Katz said.

We need weapons now!': IDF presents findings on October 7 massac...	Findings reveal Hamas killed 22 foreign workers in 2 waves; despite alert at 6:38 a.m., alert squad response delayed due to rocket fire; Thai worker in distress mistakenly shot dead after area cleared of terrorists The IDF is presenting its investigation into the October 7 attack on Kibbutz Alumim to the local community. IDF Manpower Directorate Chief Maj delivered the findings. Gen. Dado Bar Kalifa, along with Col. Ido Saad, a resident of the Gaza border region who led the inquiry, and another reserve colonel. According to the military, nearly 100 Hamas terrorists carried out a massacre in and around the kibbutz, which the military designated as the 'Alumim Area.' The investigation found that around 40 terrorists were killed in the area. The death toll in the kibbutz itself reached approximately 45, including 22 Thai and Nepali agricultural workers who were murdered inside the kibbutz; Bipin Joshi, a Nepali national who was kidnapped after saving his colleagues from the terrorists; Ofek Aton, who fled the Nova music festival and sought shelter in the home of an elderly couple, but was mistakenly identified as a terrorist and shot by the local alert squad; Capt. Itay Cohen, a commander in the IDF’s elite combat engineering unit Yahalom; Ido 'Crido' Rosenthal, a 45-year-old veteran of elite Air Force commando unit Shaldag; brothers Noam and Yishay Slotki from Be’er Sheva, who joined the fighting independently; and Sgt. First Class Ran Gvili of the police special patrol unit Yasam, whose body remains in Hamas captivity. Several festivalgoers from Nova attempted to flee and took shelter in a field bomb shelter near the kibbutz, later dubbed 'The Shelter of Death'—where they were brutally murdered. Among those abducted from the site were Romi Gonen, who was released in the first phase of the recent hostage deal, and Ofir Tzarfati, who was kidnapped and murdered; his body was later returned to Israel during the war. Operations soldier to security coordinator: 'Stay in the shelter' According to the IDF inquiry, at 6:38 a.m. on October 7, the kibbutz security coordinator was alerted by an IDF operations room soldier about a possible terrorist infiltration and was advised to activate the alert squad. However, the security coordinator hesitated due to ongoing rocket fire, responding, 'Why? So we can get rockets on our heads?' After consulting with a nearby officer, the operations soldier agreed, telling him, 'Understood. You may stay in the shelter and await orders.' As a result, the alert squad was not mobilized. At 7:00 a.m., a terrorist cell of 10 Hamas operatives breached the rear gate of the kibbutz and launched a massacre at the Thai and Nepali workers’ housing. The group then advanced toward the main entrance, reaching Highway 232 by 7:10 a.m., where they murdered Nova festival survivors seeking refuge. At that point, a Golani Brigade force arrived and engaged the terrorists, killing one. The remaining attackers retreated back through the rear gate and returned to Gaza. Hearing gunfire inside the kibbutz, 15 members of the alert squad attempted to mobilize on their own—but found the weapons storage facility locked. Recordings obtained by Ynet capture the panic as residents frantically searched for the key: 'Do you have the key to the armory? We need weapons now, everyone to the armory—urgent!' one voice is heard saying. Another voice, identified as Amichai Shaham, responds: 'I don’t have the key. I’m armed with a pistol on the inner road—if someone gets here.' In the recording, he warns, 'The shooting is very close. I think it’s coming from the Thai workers’ housing—there are explosions and massive gunfire.' At 7:22 a.m., the security coordinator finally arrived with the key, allowing the team to arm themselves and begin sweeping the kibbutz—tending to the wounded at the foreign workers’ housing complex and securing the main entrance. The IDF commended in its report the bravery of the kibbutz's alert squad and residents, who continued fighting throughout the day. At 9:20 a.m., nearly three hours into the Hamas assault, additional terrorists in pickup trucks breached the fence near the orchards. Shaham was the first to respond, firing at the attackers before being severely wounded. The remaining terrorists stormed the kibbutz, launching another massacre at the workers' housing. Minutes later, another gunfight erupted outside the main gate, where a Yasam unit engaged Hamas operatives. Sgt. First Class Gvili was killed in the battle, and his body was taken to Gaza, where it remains. Brothers Noam and Yishay Slotki also fell in the same battle. An IAF combat helicopter later struck targets near the kibbutz’s packing house, eliminating multiple Hamas terrorists. Inside the kibbutz, alert squad members fought alone until 11:30 a.m., when the first Masada Prison Service counterterrorism unit entered. They were later joined by Yahalom, Shaldag and Golani forces. During the battle inside Kibbutz Alumim, Capt. Itay Cohen and Ido 'Crido' Rosenthal were killed. Four members of the alert squad were wounded. Foreign worker mistakenly shot after kibbutz cleared of terrorists As the fighting in Kibbutz Alumim wound down on October 7, a man ran toward an IDF unit near the gate around 7:00 p.m., shouting in Thai. Soldiers, believing the area had already been cleared of terrorists, mistook him for a Hamas operative and shot him dead. It was later revealed that the suspect was a foreign worker, likely from Thailand, who was in severe shock and distress. Even 17 months later, his identity remains unknown to the IDF. Officers who investigated the incident believe he may have fled from Moshav Shuva, a nearby agricultural community. The presentation of the findings began with a moment of silence. A Kibbutz Alumim resident told Ynet that, similar to briefings in other attacked communities, 'military representatives repeatedly apologized throughout the session.' However, she expressed frustration with the scope of the inquiry, saying, 'It’s strange to have someone walk into your home and tell you what happened in your own house. Most of the fighting here was done by the alert squad, but they didn’t really sit down with all of us to investigate. I wouldn’t call this a comprehensive inquiry—it was a military investigation, focused on the army’s actions.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: She acknowledged that the IDF did a relatively thorough job but also had its shortcomings, adding that new details emerged from the briefing. According to the findings, about 350 IDF soldiers operated in and around the kibbutz that day, though most had not originally been assigned there—they were passing through on their way to Be’eri and other locations. The resident also criticized the response to the massacre, arguing that the murder of 22 foreign workers had not been treated with the same urgency as Israeli casualties. 'If our 22 murdered workers had been Israeli and not foreign laborers, the entire story here would have been handled differently—and it would have exploded into a national scandal,' she said. She also noted that some wounded workers were given tourniquets but later died from blood loss after hours without medical attention, suggesting that had they been Israeli, they would have received different treatment. In response, the IDF said, 'The investigation into the battle at Kibbutz Alumim was presented to the community, and its findings will be released in the coming days. The IDF failed in its mission to defend the communities on October 7 and bows its head in memory of the fallen.' The statement also praised the bravery of those who fought that day. 'The IDF honors the heroism of the alert squads, IDF soldiers, reservists and civilians who fought with determination and dedication during the battle.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1u3hpdh1l	2025-03-18T15:05:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/16/B1xBcsI9Z6/B1xBcsI9Z6_0_110_1280_721_0_small.jpg

War and domestic strife worsen gender disparities for Middle East...	With eroding gender equality, women are facing financial hardship, increased caregiving burdens and diminished leadership roles in Israel and Egypt Over the last year, the conditions for many women in the Middle East have gone from bad to worse. Facing economic, social, and political setbacks in Egypt and Israel in the wake of the war, women are facing eroding gender equality, forcing many into financial hardship and pushing them out of leadership roles. According to Tali Nir, CEO of the NGO 121 – Engine for Social Change, Israeli women have suffered significant setbacks over the past year. 'We are seeing a decline in women’s status across multiple sectors,' Nir told The Media Line. 'Women are bearing the brunt of the war—economically, socially, and in decision-making spaces. This isn’t just about representation. It directly affects decision-making. When women are excluded from leadership, policies that address their needs—especially in times of crisis—are simply not a priority.' In 2025, only six women out of 32 hold ministerial positions, and none hold key roles in Israel. Similarly, the current Knesset has 30 female members, accounting for 25% of the 120-seat parliament. This is a slight decrease from the previous Knesset, which had 35 women MKs, marking an all-time high. The private sector mirrors this trend, with fewer women in executive roles and corporate leadership. The situation isn’t limited to Israel and Egypt; Noha Elkhouly, International Relations Officer from The Egyptian Center for Women's Rights, highlights similar struggles for Egyptian women. 'The year 2024 witnessed continued challenges facing Egyptian women, despite constitutional promises of gender equality.' Elkhouly explained to The Media Line that 'The lack of mechanisms to protect women who report abuse leaves many at increased risk, both in the public sphere and within the family.' According to her, during the year 2025, their focus will be largely on 'Enacting a family law that keeps pace with modern changes, respects the multiple roles of women, and emphasizes partnership in building the family, and enacting a law to combat domestic violence and early marriage.' The Egyptian Family Health Survey found that 31% of previously married women between the ages of 15 and 49 have been subjected to some form of physical, sexual, or psychological violence at least once. The lack of legal enforcement mechanisms prevents women from seeking justice. In Egypt, 26% of women reported domestic violence in the form of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of their husbands. Meanwhile, divorce rates have surged, reaching 265,606 cases in 2023, raising concerns about the effectiveness of legal reforms intended to protect women and resolve family disputes. Despite the establishment of the Personal Status Law Amendment Committee over two years ago to improve justice and mitigate conflicts, progress remains uncertain. The growing number of abuse cases and divorces serves as a stark warning of eroding public trust in Egypt’s justice and legislative systems. In terms of feminine leadership, gender disparity in Egypt remains stark. 'Despite some progress, women remain underrepresented in leadership positions,' Elkhouly says. 'The July 2024 cabinet reshuffle included only four women out of 30 ministers, which is a mere 13.3%.' The lack of mechanisms ensuring women’s participation in decision-making spaces remains a major obstacle. Beyond these setbacks, women also face growing financial hardships. In Israel, the gender wage gap has widened to 35 percent, compared to 33 percent in previous years. 'The cost of living has surged, yet salaries in female-dominated professions have remained stagnant,' Nir explains. 'And the people who suffer the most are often single mothers, caregivers, and elderly women living off small pensions.' In Egypt, the economic challenges for women are even steeper. Elkhouly notes that Egypt ranked 140th in the Women's Economic Participation Index for 2023-2024, according to the World Economic Forum. The unemployment rate among women is 17.8%, compared to 4.7% among men. 'The financial system still does not fully accommodate women, which limits their ability to break out of cycles of poverty and violence,' she told The Media Line. Women continue to face significant wage gaps, with employed females earning substantially less than their male counterparts. 'The annual bulletin of employment statistics shows that women earn an average weekly wage that is EGP 164 less than men,' Elkhouly states. 'This persistent economic disparity affects their ability to achieve financial independence.' In Israel, wartime budget cuts have also exacerbated these problems as vocational training programs that helped women advance their careers have been slashed, limiting economic and social mobility. Funding for early childhood education was cut by half, making it even harder for mothers to balance professional and family responsibilities. 'This is an invisible crisis,' Nir warns. 'Many women are leaving the workforce or struggling to advance because they simply don’t have the support they need.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Women have been left with a double burden—handling financial stress, emotional trauma, and caregiving responsibilities all at once,' Nir says. 'If your child is home, suffering from anxiety, regressing developmentally, or struggling emotionally, and there’s no proper support system, what do you do? You quit your job.' Despite not having to handle the situation of the war, in Egypt, women feel there is no institutional security for them. 'Law enforcement has become a platform for violence against mothers who dare to seek divorce,' she explains. 'When mothers attempt to gain custody, they face retaliation, counter-reports, and legal obstacles that prevent them from protecting their children,' Elkhouly added. Facing challenges from so many fronts, 'Women have come too far to go backward,' Nir said. 'We must keep fighting for our place at the table—not just in war, but in shaping the peace that comes after.' Elkhouly echoes a similar sentiment. 'The challenges we face today should serve as a warning bell,' she says. 'Without stronger legal protections and policy changes, we risk further eroding the hard-won gains of women in our society.'

Houthi official: Yemen is at war with the US, escalation likely	Houthi foreign minister Jamal Amer warns Gulf states to remain neutral as tensions rise; despite US airstrikes across Yemen, Amer vows continued attacks on Israeli-linked ships and insists Iran not dictating Houthi actions Three days after the start of the U.S. military’s bombing campaign in Yemen, the foreign minister of the Houthi government Jamal Amer said on Tuesday that his organization is effectively at war with the United States and that escalation is a likely scenario. In an interview with Reuters, Amer warned Gulf states, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, to avoid interfering in the conflict and expressed appreciation that they have so far remained neutral. Two senior Iranian officials told Reuters that Tehran, the Houthis' main ally, had twice in recent days sent messages to the Yemeni rebel group urging them to de-escalate tensions. This came after the Houthis declared that they were resuming attacks on Israeli-linked ships in the Red Sea as retaliation for blocking aid to Gaza. The officials said that one message was delivered to the Houthis’ envoy in Tehran on Friday, while a similar message was conveyed on Sunday by Iran’s foreign minister during a visit to Oman, which Iran considers a mediator with the Houthis. Officially, Iran has not publicly acknowledged sending such messages, likely to avoid contradicting its longstanding claim that the Houthis make their decisions independently and do not act under Iran’s directives. In the interview, conducted late Monday night and published on Tuesday, Amer said that his organization would not 'dial down' its operations against Israeli-linked ships in the Red Sea, neither in response to pressure from Washington nor requests from its allies in Iran. He also claimed not to be aware of any message delivered via the Houthi envoy in Tehran. 'There will be no talk of any dialing down of operations before ending the aid blockade in Gaza. Iran is not interfering in our decision but what is happening is that it mediates sometimes but it cannot dictate things,' Amer said. Amer confirmed receiving messages from other parties requesting the Houthis to de-escalate tensions. However, he added, 'Now we see that Yemen is at war with the U.S. and that means that we have a right to defend ourselves with all possible means, so escalation is likely.' He accused the U.S. of escalating the situation, claiming that the Houthis had targeted only Israeli-linked ships in the Red Sea, not international vessels, and that the U.S. chose to respond regardless. > Amer also highlighted that Saudi Arabia, which supports the Houthis' rivals in Yemen and previously conducted years of bombing campaigns against the group, has so far refrained from military intervention in the current conflict, as have other Gulf states. He expressed appreciation for their neutrality but issued a warning: If Gulf states intervene militarily, they risk becoming targets themselves. 'If any aircraft or base is used against us then we will escalate and we will defend ourselves, but if they (Gulf states) continue to be neutral we will stay away,' Amer said. Amer’s remarks came after U.S. President Donald Trump issued a stark warning to Iran, accusing it of continuing to fund, arm and provide intelligence to the Houthi despite Tehran’s denials. 'Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN,' Trump declared in a Truth Social post, vowing that Iran would face 'dire consequences' for any further aggression. Shortly after his remarks, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reinforced the administration’s stance, saying, 'There’s a new sheriff in town,' and cautioning Iran to take Trump’s warning seriously. Houthi attacks on international shipping since October 2023 have caused significant damage to global maritime trade, forcing ships that would normally travel through the Suez Canal to use safer alternate routes and dramatically increasing insurance costs. When the U.S. bombing campaign began on Saturday, Trump promised the Houthis that 'hell' awaited them and declared, 'Your time is up.' According to U.S. sources, several senior commanders of the Yemeni group have been killed since the operation began. While Washington initially said that the attacks might continue for weeks, the Pentagon struck a more cautious tone on Monday night. The U.S. Department of Defense clarified that it is not attempting to overthrow the Houthi regime and that the bombing campaign would cease once the Houthis declare they will halt their attacks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkyuvbdhye	2025-03-18T12:42:04-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/17/S1zkdnSnyg/S1zkdnSnyg_19_66_2241_1262_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu: Hamas rejected all proposals, talks will now be ‘under...	PM says IDF advised resuming heavy combat against Hamas, vows Israel will intensify strikes; praises US coordination against Houthis, hints at Iran: 'We have much more work against other parts of the Axis of Evil' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that negotiations with Hamas will now take place only under fire, following the resumption of intense Israeli military operations in Gaza. In a pre-recorded statement, Netanyahu said Israel returned to combat after Hamas refused all ceasefire and hostage release proposals. 'For weeks, we worked toward one goal—to exhaust every effort to bring our hostages home,' Netanyahu said. 'We extended the ceasefire for weeks, sent delegations, made proposals with mediators and accepted the U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff’s offer. Hamas, in contrast, rejected every proposal time and again.' Netanyahu claimed Hamas never intended to uphold the next phase of the agreement, which would have included a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war. Hamas officials countered that Israel failed to fulfill its commitments, which they claim led to a breakdown in talks. Hamas also denied rejecting Witkoff’s proposal outright, though the group had reportedly only agreed to release one hostage—Edan Alexander—and the bodies of four others, all of whom held American citizenship. Netanyahu stated that he, along with Defense Minister Israel Katz, had accepted the IDF’s recommendation to resume heavy fighting against Hamas. However, the IDF refused to confirm whether its leadership had specifically advised the government to launch the latest wave of airstrikes in Gaza overnight. 'Israel will now act against Hamas with increasing force,' Netanyahu declared. 'Hamas has already felt our military power in the past 24 hours. I promise you—and them—this is just the beginning. We will keep fighting until we achieve all of our war objectives. Gaza will no longer be a threat to Israel.' Addressing the families of hostages, Netanyahu said he remained committed to bringing them home, adding that previous releases had been secured through military pressure. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Our hearts are with them,' he said. 'They are living an impossible nightmare—every day, every minute. But it has been proven in the past that military pressure is a necessary condition for freeing more hostages.' Netanyahu described the war as a 'War of Revival' across seven fronts, indicating Israel’s broader regional challenges. Netanyahu also referenced the Houthi missile launch that targeted the Be'er Sheva area Tuesday evening, issuing a veiled threat toward Iran, which backs the Yemeni rebels. 'I deeply appreciate our coordination with the Americans against this proxy force,' he said. 'We have much more work to do against other parts of the Axis of Evil. But I am confident—we will defeat them, with God’s help. Together, we will act, and together, we will win.' However, unlike U.S. President Donald Trump, who had declared that any Houthi attack would be considered an Iranian attack, Netanyahu stopped short of issuing a direct warning to Tehran. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy11g8sp2je	2025-03-18T11:24:14-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/18/SJ1fkHP2kl/SJ1fkHP2kl_7_0_1255_706_0_small.jpg
80 strikes in 10 minutes: How Israel’s overnight Gaza operation u...	IDF strikes mid-level Hamas commanders in surprise overnight raid; military says Hamas planned attacks on Israeli outposts; Hamas denies rejecting US ceasefire proposal, while Houthis threaten more missile launches if Israel continues Gaza operations The IDF launched a surprise operation in Gaza early Tuesday, striking 80 targets simultaneously. The strikes, which began at 2:10 a.m., lasted less than 10 minutes, with Israeli fighter jets hitting all designated targets within two minutes, the IDF said. The strikes did not target Hamas’ senior military leadership but rather mid-level commanders, including battalion and company leaders, as well as government officials such as the head of Hamas’ Shura Council, the justice and interior ministers and the prime minister of the terrorist group. The operation was conducted in full coordination with the Shin Bet, with agency director Ronen Bar overseeing it alongside IDF commanders, the military said. Following the operation, the Home Front Command eased civilian restrictions in the Gaza border region, allowing schools to reopen in areas where shelters are accessible. Train service in the south is expected to resume within 48 hours, pending further security assessments. The IDF said it is operating under a 'gradual, evolving battle plan' against Hamas, adjusting intensity and scope based on real-time assessments. 'We present professional recommendations to the political leadership,' the military said. 'We also held a situation assessment with the Hostages and Missing Persons Directorate today.' IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir visited the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, touring Rafah alongside Gaza Division Commander Brig. Gen. Barak Hiram. 'Your mission is to protect the communities,' Zamir told troops. 'We are engaged in a continuous operation against Hamas while remaining fully committed to bringing the hostages home.' In addition to the Gaza offensive, the IDF also targeted artillery positions in Khan Arnabeh, Syria, after identifying a threat to Israeli territory. Meanwhile, Israel intercepted a missile near Saudi Arabia that had been launched from Yemen toward the Negev region. Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree claimed responsibility for the launch, saying the group had fired a Palestine 2 hypersonic ballistic missile at Israel. 'If Israeli strikes in Gaza do not stop, we will expand our list of targets in Israel in the coming hours and days,' Saree warned. The IDF acknowledged the risks posed to hostages as combat resumes, stating that Chief of Staff Zamir has issued explicit orders to take every possible precaution. However, officials admitted that intelligence is not always complete and that 'there is no 100% certainty' when carrying out operations. As fighting intensified, Hamas spokesman Abdel Latif al-Qanua claimed that the group did not reject the ceasefire proposal put forward by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. 'Witkoff’s proposal was on the negotiating table. Hamas did not reject it and responded positively,' al-Qanua said, accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of resuming hostilities to 'sabotage the agreement.' He further claimed that Israel tightened its blockade, closed border crossings and refused to negotiate the next phase of the deal in an attempt to derail the agreement and restart the war. 'Hamas' interest was to continue the ceasefire,' al-Qanua said. 'We will remain flexible and engage with mediators to push back against aggression and force Israel into an agreement.'

'Hamas has felt the strength of our military in the past 24 hours,' he continued. 'I assure you—and them—this is just the beginning. We will continue fighting until we achieve all of our war objectives.' Netanyahu also expressed solidarity with the families of the hostages, saying: 'My heart is with them.

Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on Tuesday to a proposal by U.S. President Donald Trump for Russia and Ukraine to stop hitting each other's energy infrastructure for 30 days and gave a corresponding order to the Russian military, the Kremlin said. The Kremlin said in a statement that the two leaders had a 'detailed and frank exchange of views' on Ukraine during a phone call in which Putin had said that a resolution of the conflict must be 'comprehensive, sustainable and long-term', taking into account Russia's own security interests and the root causes of the war. The two leaders discussed a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, to which Ukraine agreed last week. The Kremlin said Putin had raised 'significant points' about monitoring such a truce and preventing it from being used by Ukraine to mobilise more soldiers and rearm itself. 'It was emphasized that the key condition for preventing the escalation of the conflict and working towards its resolution by political and diplomatic means should be a complete cessation of foreign military assistance and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv,' the Kremlin said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1rkavph1x	2025-03-18T10:40:19-07:00	
The senior Gaza terror officials eliminated in Israeli onslaught	Six senior Hamas officials, including key political and military figures, killed in Israeli airstrikes; operation comes as Hamas uses ceasefire to rearm, with Gaza health officials claiming over 400 fatalities since fighting resumed As the Israel-Hamas hostilities are once again in full swing, with waves of Israeli Air Force airstrikes pounding the Gaza Strip, Hamas claimed that more than 400 people were killed. Reports from Gaza indicated that six senior members of the terrorist organization were eliminated, including Essam al-Da'alis, a member of Hamas' political bureau and head of the terrorist group's government in Gaza. Israel had hinted that he was killed at the beginning of the war. Saudi news outlet Al Hadath reported that among those killed was Abu Hamza, the spokesperson for Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). Later, PIJ officials confirmed his death. According to reports, Abu Hamza, who also served as the commander of the organization's rocket unit, was killed in an airstrike in Nuseirat along with his wife, son and other family members. Additionally, it was reported that Khamis Barhoum, a senior member of Hamas' military wing, was killed in another strike along with his wife and children. Barhoum was responsible for the massacre at Kerem Shalom during the October 7 attack and served as the deputy commander of the Rafah Brigade under Mohammed Shabaneh. The aerial operation began with an emphasis on surprising Hamas after hundreds of new targets were identified during the two-month ceasefire. Over 20,000 Hamas and PIJ operatives were redeployed across the Gaza Strip. The decision to launch a wide-scale air offensive in Gaza, effectively ending the ceasefire, was made in response to Hamas' preparations to carry out attacks and its rearmament efforts during the ceasefire. As part of the extensive airstrikes, IDF targeted mid-level Hamas commanders, senior members of Hamas' politburo and the organization's infrastructure. Al-Da’alis, born in Jabaliya and residing in Nuseirat, was a key figure in Hamas. He served as the head of governmental oversight in Gaza, a role akin to prime minister for the terrorist organization since it took control of the enclave in 2007. He was considered one of Hamas' top administrative and organizational figures, playing a significant role in managing civilian affairs and services in Gaza. He actively participated in the general policies of Hamas' government and also served as the head of the teachers' organization within UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. Al-Da’alis also worked as an advisor to former Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh. His brother stated in an interview with Al Jazeera Tuesday morning that at least three of al-Da’alis' sons and two of his grandchildren were killed during IDF bombings in Gaza Monday night. Bahajat Abu Sultan, a senior Hamas security official, was also killed in an Israeli airstrike. Abu Sultan, whose rank was equivalent to a brigadier general, was responsible for internal security operations in Gaza and held several key positions within Hamas’ Ministry of Interior and security services. As director-general of Hamas’ administration in the ministry, he played a central role in the group’s governance and frequently participated in field visits, including trips by Hamas leadership to the families of prisoners. Ahmed Amar Abdullah Alhata, known as 'Abu Omar,' served as the director-general of Hamas' Ministry of Justice in Gaza. He was known for advancing the Islamic judicial system in the enclave. In 2021, he also served as the dean of the Ribat College for police training in Gaza. Mahmoud Abu Watfa, the director-general of Hamas' Ministry of Interior, was another casualty of IDF strikes. According to Hamas, Abu Watfa held the rank of general and was killed along with his family in an airstrike on his home in Gaza City. In January, after the ceasefire came into effect, Abu Watfa appeared in a video speaking with a Gazan woman, emphasizing his commitment to rebuilding the enclave. He told her, 'We will make Gaza stronger.' > According to a statement from Hamas' police last month, Abu Watfa inspected security and police forces in the Strip, approved their deployment in various areas, released 'all troublemakers' and emphasized the police's role in maintaining public security. His death is considered a significant loss for Hamas and its security services in Gaza due to his prominent role in enhancing security and stability in the Strip. Hamas political bureau member Abu Ubaida Mohammed Al-Jamassi, an engineer by training, served as the head of the terrorist group's administrative body in the southern Gaza Strip before meeting his demise in the overnight strikes. His last public appearance was in July 2023, when he attended a memorial for Hamas co-founder Ramadan Al-Saifi. He was not seen again before the October 7 massacre, after which he disappeared. In July 2017, Al-Jamassi served as the head of Hamas' legal department, where he worked to overturn the European Court's decision to keep Hamas on the EU's list of terrorist organizations. At the time, he urged the court to reconsider its decision and emphasized the 'legitimacy of resistance under international law.' The Qatari newspaper The New Arab reported Tuesday morning, citing 'family sources,' that Yasser Harb, a member of Hamas' political bureau, was also killed during the IDF strikes in Gaza overnight. Five of his children were killed in the war since October 7, 2023. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skd8m11p2ke	2025-03-18T10:32:03-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/05/14/SJismKCEh/SJismKCEh_107_0_974_548_0_small.jpg

IDF strikes Gaza, but is Israel ready for a full war restart?	Military launches rolling operation with escalation points, leaving room for Hamas deal before full ground offensive; no mass reservist call-up signals time remains; thousands of Hamas operatives fled to tunnels, while hostage remain in danger Two days after Knesset member Gadi Eisenkot revealed that more than 25,000 armed terrorists remain active in Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) brigades—and urged the government to refocus on achieving the war’s objectives—the IDF launched a fresh assault on the Gaza Strip overnight Tuesday. At this stage, the operation resembles past escalation rounds that preceded the October 7 massacre rather than the sustained fighting seen in earlier phases of the war. Unlike previous high-intensity days of combat, the IDF has not provided the public with details on the operation’s objectives, what to expect next or the potential risks to the dozens of hostages still held by Hamas. The renewed offensive included dozens of air and naval strikes, carried out by fighter jets, helicopters and drones. The primary targets were Hamas operatives and senior political figures, as well as tunnel shafts, weapons production sites and arms depots. Security officials describe the operation as a rolling event, meaning it will progress or pause in stages, depending on developments in the coming days. This approach leaves room for Hamas to decide whether to accept a cease-fire proposal put forward by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. The deal is expected to involve the release of around 10 hostages in exchange for several weeks of quiet and the renewed entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The next phases of the operation, prepared by Southern Command, include intensifying airstrikes and moving civilian populations out of border-adjacent areas—a step the IDF once again ordered residents to take on Tuesday morning, marking the umpteenth evacuation order in the past year and a half. The most significant escalation, however, would be a full-scale return to ground combat, a move that requires approval from Israel’s political leadership. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has already begun signaling this possibility during a visit to the Tel Nof Airbase following the night’s air operation. 'Hamas must understand that the rules of the game have changed—if it does not immediately release all the hostages, the gates of hell will open, and it will face the full force of the IDF by air, sea and land—until its complete destruction,' Katz declared during a visit to the 133th Squadron. 'We will not stop fighting until the hostages are brought home and every threat to the residents of the south is eliminated.' In his inaugural speech, incoming IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir acknowledged that the primary objective of militarily defeating Hamas has not yet been achieved and that the group remains in control of Gaza, both militarily and administratively. Thousands of Hamas operatives who had positioned themselves near Israeli forces along the buffer zone in recent weeks—protected from IDF fire due to cease-fire restrictions—likely retreated Tuesday morning, either into underground bunkers or into densely populated areas. The IDF estimates that a detailed operational assessment will be needed to determine how many of the hundreds of Gazans killed in the latest strikes were actually Hamas or PIJ members. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Military officials are aware that public legitimacy for continued operations has shifted compared to the early months of the war, and that this could influence future decisions. Unlike at the start of the war, reservists no longer need ideological reasons to avoid reporting for duty—many are already struggling with financial and family constraints, a reality well understood by unit commanders. Adding to this complexity are political considerations, including opposition claims that the timing of the operation is linked to the upcoming state budget vote and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s interest in bringing Itamar Ben-Gvir back into the coalition. Meanwhile, the government continues to push forward military exemption laws demanded by ultra-Orthodox parties, and former hostages and their families are pressuring officials not to endanger those still held in Gaza. Last month, the government gave the IDF the green light to re-mobilize hundreds of thousands of reservists under the same 'open-ended emergency call-up' (Tzav 8) used at the start of the ground operation. However, IDF officials have made it clear to the political leadership that due to fatigue and economic strain, reservist turnout has dropped significantly compared to the early months of the war, now averaging 60-80%—a factor that must be considered in every escalation stage. Reflecting this reality, the IDF did not immediately recall reservists, signaling that the next phase of fighting is not imminent. The fact that civilian restrictions were only imposed in the Gaza border region, and that schools were only closed in those areas, further suggests that Israel is not rushing into full-scale combat and is still allowing room for a possible cease-fire or hostage deal. The IDF has also warned the leadership about the risks to the remaining hostages, emphasizing that the military is taking extreme precautions to avoid strikes that could endanger them. However, despite these efforts, no military or political official is willing to guarantee that renewed fighting will not put hostages at risk—whether due to Hamas ordering executions or an unintended Israeli strike near their locations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryfltbv3kg	2025-03-18T08:06:42-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/18/B1f8hA8nkx/B1f8hA8nkx_0_0_1280_852_0_small.jpg

He emphasized: 'My wife and children were kidnapped alive and murdered in captivity. Military pressure endangers the hostages, an agreement brings them home. I am terrified for my best friends, David and Ariel Cunio.

Israeli border residents fear evacuation over renewed Gaza fighti...	IDF airstrikes target Hamas leadership after ceasefire collapse, displacing border communities and closing schools as Gaza violence reignites; 'Families have already packed their bags and left the kibbutz' After weeks of ceasefire, fighting resumed in Gaza on Tuesday as the IDF struck dozens of targets. Residents of Israeli border communities, who had hoped for a gradual return to normalcy, once again found themselves hearing explosions, and were left without open schools for their children and facing uncertainty. 'Our morning started at 2 a.m. Families have already packed their bags and left the kibbutz,' said Martin Siorno, a member of Kibbutz Mefalsim’s management. 'We don't know if the kibbutz will need to be evacuated again. We're especially worried about the children because all schools and kindergartens are closed, meaning parents can't go to work.' 'Our lives are on hold again and no one is telling us what to do. Whoever can is packing up and leaving. We're back in a war zone. It's frustrating. We wake up in the morning and realize that Hamas is still in control of Gaza,' he added. Liad, a resident of Kibbutz Yad Mordechai, shared a similar sentiment. 'It's a terrible deja vu. The saddest part is that we're back here after a year and a half and it's still not over. The hostages are still not home. I considered packing a bag and coming back in a few days. It felt like we were one step away from the end, that we could return to normal and rebuild. Turns out we can't. We're back to nighttime explosions and a wartime routine.' Doron Shabtai, a father and resident of Sderot, pointed out the absurdity of the situation. 'On one hand, it's a terrible experience — there's once again anxiety over rockets and we're preparing for possible evacuation. We've been through this before. When they announce that schools are closed but workplaces stay open, the parents need to deal with it,' he said. 'It's infuriating because these people have been abandoned by the state time and time again. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'On the other hand, we saw Hamas reorganizing during the weeks of ceasefire and you could hear gunfire from Gaza. It's an impossible situation and I don't know how to solve it. We're ready for evacuation — we packed our bags and drove to Ashdod today, but it's a tough dilemma. Evacuating is traumatic but so is having rockets hit your home.' As fighting with Hamas resumed overnight with waves of airstrikes across Gaza, the terror group claimed more than 400 people were killed and reports from the Strip said six senior Hamas officials were eliminated. The aerial campaign was designed to take Hamas by surprise after the IDF gathered intelligence on hundreds of new targets during the two-month ceasefire. Over 20,000 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists were identified as having redeployed across Gaza. The decision to launch a widespread air assault — and effectively end the ceasefire — was made in response to Hamas' preparations for attacks, its military buildup during the lull and its successful rearmament efforts, according to military officials. As part of the large-scale airstrikes, the IDF is targeting mid-level Hamas commanders, senior figures in the terror group’s politburo and terror infrastructure. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk5fac83yx	2025-03-18T05:05:06-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/18/HJzA39Ihkg/HJzA39Ihkg_765_383_1094_616_0_small.jpg

International backlash surges as Israel resumes airstrikes in Gaz...	UN and Turkey denounce Israel’s Gaza airstrikes as ceasefire collapses, with Egypt urging restraint and humanitarian aid amid reports of hundreds killed The international community responded Tuesday to the resumption of fighting in Gaza, Israeli airstrikes across the Strip and the end of the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. The overnight strikes were coordinated with the White House and backed by U.S. President Donald Trump. The United Nations strongly condemned the strikes and expressed shock at the renewed fighting. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was 'shocked' and urged Israel to honor the cease-fire. He called for the immediate resumption of humanitarian aid to Gaza and the unconditional release of hostages held by Hamas. Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said he was 'horrified by last night’s Israeli airstrikes and shelling in Gaza, which killed hundreds, according to the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry in the Strip. This will add tragedy onto tragedy. Israel’s resorting to yet more military force will only heap further misery upon a Palestinian population already suffering catastrophic conditions.' UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, Muhannad Hadi, added: 'Waves of airstrikes have hit Gaza since early morning. This is unconscionable. A ceasefire must be reinstated immediately.' Russia's Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the situation in Gaza was alarming, calling it 'another round of escalating tensions.' The Kremlin expressed particular concern over reports of heavy civilian casualties. 'We are closely monitoring the situation and waiting for calm to return,' Peskov said. China also voiced 'serious concern' over the renewed fighting. Beijing’s foreign ministry urged all parties to 'avoid actions that could lead to escalation' and said it was 'deeply troubled by the current situation between Israel and Palestine, hoping all sides will prevent a major humanitarian crisis.' Iran said it strongly condemns a new round of Israeli attacks. Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said the United States has direct responsibility for 'the continuation of genocide in the occupied Palestinian territories.' Turkey, whose relations with Israel have deteriorated during the war amid harsh rhetoric from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, issued a particularly strong condemnation. Its foreign ministry called Israel’s attacks on Gaza 'a new phase in its policy of genocide,' against Palestinians. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The massacre of hundreds of Palestinians in Israel’s attacks on Gaza this morning demonstrates that [Benjamin] Netanyahu’s government’s policy of genocide has entered a new stage,' Ankara said. 'Israel is defying humanity through the gravest violations of international law and universal values.' Turkey urged the international community to take decisive action to uphold the cease-fire and ensure humanitarian aid reaches Gaza. The ministry warned that Israel was creating 'a new cycle of violence' and that its 'hostile approach' threatened the future of the Middle East. Egypt, which has attempted to mediate between Israel and Hamas alongside Qatar, condemned the Israeli strikes, calling them a violation of the ceasefire agreement and a 'dangerous escalation' with serious consequences for regional stability. Cairo urged all parties to exercise restraint and 'give mediation efforts a chance to reach a permanent agreement in Gaza.' 'Egypt opposes Israel’s aggression, which is reigniting tensions in the region and calls on the international community to halt the assault on Gaza to prevent a new cycle of violence,' Cairo said in a statement. An Egyptian source told the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that 'senior officials in the General Intelligence Service had urgently invited a Hamas delegation to Cairo to discuss ways to stop the aggression in Gaza.' Meanwhile, Yemen’s Houthis, who have been targeted by a series of U.S. strikes, said: 'The Palestinian people will not stand alone in this battle. Yemen will continue its support and assistance and will escalate its confrontation measures.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj2pgri21e	2025-03-18T03:41:58-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/18/HJtIWTU3Je/HJtIWTU3Je_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

University of Michigan president: 'Despite protests, we have incr...	Over the past year, the campus - home to a large Arab and Muslim student population - has seen numerous, sometimes violent, demonstrations demanding that the university sever ties with Israeli institutions; 'The real problem on our campus is antisemitism' University of Michigan President Professor Santa Ono announced that, in response to pro-Palestinian protests on campus and calls to divest from Israel, the university has instead increased its investments in Israeli institutions. Since Hamas’ October 7 terror attack, the University of Michigan has become one of the epicenters of anti-Israel protests in the U.S., fueled in part by the state’s large Arab and Muslim student population. Over the past year, the campus has seen numerous, sometimes violent, demonstrations demanding that the university sever ties with Israeli institutions. On the one-year anniversary of the massacre, anti-Israel graffiti was sprayed on the homes of senior university officials, including President Ono and Provost Dr. Laurie McCauley. In a separate incident, the car of the wife of Jewish trustee Jordan Acker — who oversees the university’s investment portfolio — was vandalized, and foul-smelling liquid was poured inside their home. According to Ono, these personal attacks against him and other university leaders only strengthened their resolve to deepen ties with Israeli academic institutions. 'The real problem on our campus is antisemitism,' Ono said. 'We are committed to creating an environment where every student can study without fear of persecution.' The University of Michigan, one of the largest and most prestigious universities in the U.S., and currently home to Israeli-American basketball player Danny Wolf, has long-standing partnerships with Israeli academic institutions. Over the years, it has funded 60 joint projects with the Technion and Weizmann Institute. The university’s Board of Regents has consistently rejected calls to boycott Israel or divest from it, stating that the management of its $17.9 billion endowment is guided by financial, not political, considerations. 'My response, and that of my leadership team, to calls to boycott Israel and cut investments was not to pull back — but to strengthen our collaboration and invest even more,' Ono declared at the Anti-Defamation League 'Never is Now' conference earlier this month. 'We’ve increased our funding, and the benefits from those relationships are already apparent — and will continue to grow. Great things have come from these partnerships, and even greater things are ahead. I see BDS as antisemitism, plain and simple. It is a movement aimed at severing international academic connections, not promoting peace. We are here to ensure our core mission — education and research — continues without disruption.' The university’s decision to increase its investments in Israel comes amid a wave of protests on campus, including allegations of harassment and discrimination against Jewish and Israeli students. The U.S. Department of Education has placed the University of Michigan among 60 higher education institutions under review for 'potential enforcement actions' if antisemitism on campus is not addressed. Ono was among the first university presidents to call in police to dismantle protest encampments on campus, citing safety concerns over potential fires. Following the police raid, which resulted in the arrest of 11 students, Ono became a primary target of ongoing demonstrations, with protesters claiming he used 'safety' as a pretext to suppress free speech. Ono’s actions have drawn strong support from Michigan’s Jewish community. 'President Ono’s leadership proves his commitment to the safety and wellbeing of Jewish students on campus,' said Rabbi Davey Rosen, executive director of Michigan Hillel. Rabbi Asher Lopatin, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Ann Arbor, also praised Ono: 'Every university in the world should do this — foster collaboration between researchers from different countries to tackle global challenges like cancer and climate change.' As expected, not everyone supports Ono’s stance. Progressive U.S. Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian-American from Detroit, sent Ono an angry letter accusing him of pushing a political agenda and participating in what she called an 'extremist' organization that spreads 'racist disinformation.' Tlaib questioned how Ono’s actions align with the university’s new policy of institutional neutrality on political matters. Pro-Palestinian student groups on campus have also criticized Ono, accusing him of 'silencing voices opposed to the Israeli occupation.' Professor Lila Kawar, vice president of the university’s faculty union, said Michigan has a 'dark history' of censorship dating back to the McCarthy era. 'President Ono’s troubling remarks show a lack of sensitivity to historical precedent and are leading us in the wrong direction,' she said. The campus chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace went so far as to accuse Ono of antisemitism. 'The university is silencing Jewish students who do not align with its narrative — that’s antisemitic,' the group said in a statement. 'Perpetuating the idea that the Jewish community is monolithic is also antisemitic. The White House and university leadership are exploiting Jewish identity and weaponizing accusations of antisemitism to maintain American imperialism.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h15yptu3yl	2025-03-18T02:55:33-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/05/06/SyLCmvD8G0/SyLCmvD8G0_3_0_1278_719_0_small.jpg
The letter that led to Netanyahu's decision to fire Shin Bet chie...	Indications point to prime minister's move being motivated by incriminating letter that exposed government failures, including Qatar’s Hamas funding and flawed policies, as catalysts for the October 7 attack The real reason behind Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to fire Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar may lie in an extraordinary four-page letter Bar sent to Netanyahu, attached to the intelligence agency’s investigation into its failures ahead of October 7, Ynet learned Tuesday. The letter was delivered late at night on March 3. According to growing assessments among senior security officials, it played a key role in Netanyahu’s final decision to attempt to dismiss Bar. Israel's Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara also received the letter in the past 24 hours, and is reviewing it as part of the factual circumstances surrounding the dismissal attempt. In the letter, Bar provides a detailed account of the Shin Bet’s operational failures in the years leading up to October 7, its flawed strategic approach and its response on the day of the Hamas-led attack. But the most striking section is where Bar — breaking precedent by doing so directly to the prime minister — lays out the political leadership’s own failures that enabled the October 7 massacre. He says that 'disturbing systemic insights' had surfaced and require urgent investigation and correction. The letter essentially serves as a damning indictment of government policy over the past decade. Bar highlights the state-backed funding that helped Hamas build its military capabilities — referring to financial support from Qatar. Legal sources pointed to other issues raised in the letter, including the government’s long-standing policy of 'quiet met with quiet,' which allowed Hamas to grow stronger while undermining Israel’s ability to act on warnings, as well as years of political refusals to authorize the elimination of Hamas leaders. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Bar also tells Netanyahu that counterterrorism efforts cannot rely solely on defense but must be proactive, a stance the Shin Bet had repeatedly conveyed to Israel’s leadership in recent years. He stresses the urgent need to sever ties between Hamas and Iran’s Shiite axis. Essentially, Bar asserted that Israel’s entire security apparatus collapsed on October 7. He also cited the government’s disregard for warnings about looming threats in 2023. He told Netanyahu that a deep, independent investigation into all decision-making processes is necessary to uncover the truth — warning that failure to do so would put Israel’s security in serious jeopardy. The Shin Bet declined to comment. However, political sources believe Netanyahu’s office viewed Bar’s letter as an effort to build a case against the prime minister — ultimately prompting the decision to remove him. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skykzau31e	2025-03-18T02:33:03-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/17/r1PJgMU3kl/r1PJgMU3kl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Police investigation reveals failures in Kibbutz Be’eri battle on...	Police presented findings of their classified investigation into the October 7 battle at Kibbutz Be’eri; Families of fallen officers expressed frustration, claiming operational failures and insufficient leadership during the fight against Hamas terrorists who carried out the brutal massacre A year and five months after the October 7 massacre, police on Monday night presented findings of their investigation into the fighting to the families of eight officers and one civilian who fell in one of the battles against Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Be’eri. While IDF and Shin Bet recently released their internal investigations to the public, police decided not to disclose their findings, citing the investigation as 'classified.' Kibbutz Be’eri was one of the main combat zones stormed by hundreds of terrorists during the deadly terror attack. According to the findings presented to the families of the fallen, seven fighters from the Enforcement Coordination Directorate, an officer from the Yoav Unit, and a civilian entered the kibbutz at 2:27 p.m. in two armored vehicles. According to the police statement, 'fighters bravely engaged the terrorists, fought courageously, and acted to save the lives of the kibbutz residents from Hamas murderers who carried out a brutal massacre in the kibbutz. During the fighting, vehicles and the fighters inside were hit by gunfire, grenades and anti-tank missiles.' In this battle at Be’eri, the following Enforcement Coordination Directorate fighters were killed: Chief Superintendent Vadim Blich, Superintendent Dan Ganot, Sergeant Major Boris Danilov, First Sergeant Eliran Avergil, Sergeant First Class Mulonta Gadif, Sergeant First Class Orel Shalom Oren, and Sergeant First Class Dor Mengedi. Yoav Unit officer Chief Superintendent Avi Amar and civilian Ziv Shufan also fell in the fighting. The investigation was led by Commander Ronen Hagdosh and presented to the families of the fallen by Operations Division Chief Superintendent David Filo. Iris, the mother of Dor Mengedi, conducted her own independent investigation into the circumstances of the battle in which her son fell. She expressed disappointment with the police investigation. 'It wasn’t easy; I almost got up and left. I was the dominant voice there, and I already knew everything in this investigation. I questioned everyone who was on the ground. They didn’t answer the questions I wanted, and they didn’t talk about what really happened to the fighters inside the kibbutz,' she said. The bereaved mother added: 'I wanted to know exactly what happened after they arrived at Be’eri. Was there a briefing? I left the investigation feeling disappointed. Some officers followed me outside asking me to come back. I didn’t agree with what they said. There is a commander of the Enforcement Coordination Directorate, Commander Eyal Raon — where was he? How did he get promoted?' > Mengedi continued, 'The investigation was formal and very restrained; they didn’t want to stir up trouble. I know the real facts: the commander of the Directorate didn’t come to the scene. Your entire unit is in Be’eri — what are you doing in the command center? I’m not blaming the fighters on the ground; they functioned based on the orders they were given. But where was the commander? Go there, fight with them. I stopped them during the investigation and told them it was all a show. 'They said during the investigation that they didn’t know what was happening until 2:30 p.m. My son’s WhatsApp was filled with messages saying, ‘There are terrorists here,’ and ‘There are hostages there.’ I was furious at those who conducted the investigation. This is a complete failure; forces should have been sent there. The investigator noted that Commander Eyal should have left the command center at some point and arrived on the scene, but stated that it wouldn’t have changed the outcome.

IDF chief dismisses Brig. Gen. Erez Wiener over lost classified d...	Decision comes after Wiener lost classified documents in a civilian parking lot, raising concerns over security breaches and alleged leaks to Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich Brig. Gen. (res.) Erez Wiener was dismissed from the IDF on Tuesday, two days after Ynet reported he had lost highly classified documents. IDF Southern Command chief Maj. Gen. Yaniv Asor announced he had decided to end Wiener’s reserve service due to what he called a 'serious security breach,' after Wiener removed and lost classified documents from the Southern Command. Asor said the decision was backed by IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, who stressed the importance of maintaining information security. A day after the document loss was exposed, Ynet reported that Zamir was expected to dismiss Wiener from the military. As head of the Southern Command’s operational planning department, Wiener had participated in planning an airstrike in Gaza the night before his dismissal. However, neither Zamir nor Asor was aware of the document loss until Ynet’s report, leading to Wiener’s removal amid preparations for the operation. In his statement, Asor thanked Wiener 'for many years of service and volunteer work and especially for his significant contribution over the past 17 months of fighting in the war, during which he worked tirelessly for Israel’s security.' The incident came to light after Ynet’s inquiry revealed that Wiener had lost highly classified documents about six weeks ago in a civilian parking lot in Ramat Gan, violating military regulations. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Asor was further surprised that no disciplinary action had been taken against Wiener and that the matter had been kept in wraps within the command. The issue was not included in the handover briefing between outgoing Southern Command chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman and Asor, despite the case remaining open. The IDF was also surprised to discover that while an investigation was launched, the military police had not opened a criminal probe into the incident. The potential damages from the lost documents, which had been removed from the Southern Command base in Be’er Sheva, remains unclear. Following the report, the military is now considering opening a criminal investigation. In recent years, Wiener has been associated with right-wing circles. Last week, Israel’s public broadcasting channel Kan 11 reported that he leaked classified documents to Finance Minister and Security Cabinet member Bezalel Smotrich. One focus of the IDF’s probe is what Wiener was doing with the sensitive documents in the Ramat Gan office tower parking lot before a civilian meeting. Wiener declined to comment and the military has not ruled out a connection between his unauthorized removal of the documents and his ties to Smotrich. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjibsoinjx	2025-03-18T01:15:48-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/11/rJ36nA6s1l/rJ36nA6s1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Ben-Gvir set to return to government as Netanyahu resumes Gaza of...	Netanyahu's coalition hinges on Gaza military escalation and security shakeups, both required by Ben-Gvir to rejoin the government and stabilize government ahead of a critical budget vote Otzma Yehudit party leader Itamar Ben-Gvir's conditions to return to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government were met Tuesday overnight as the IDF resumed fighting in Gaza, following the moves to oust Israel's attorney general and fire the Shin Bet chief. The development comes a week before the budget vote, with the coalition struggling to secure a majority. Ben-Gvir had demanded that Netanyahu fulfill one of three conditions: implementing U.S. President Donald Trump's Gaza relocation plan, halting all humanitarian aid to the Strip or launching an intensified military campaign. These conditions seemed unlikely, but senior officials indicated last week that a resolution was near. Now, Ben-Gvir is expected to rejoin the government, possibly within days. Without Ben-Gvir’s support, passing the budget would be nearly impossible, as the coalition currently holds a slim 59–60 majority. In such a scenario, the government would likely avoid putting the budget to a vote for fear of defections that could collapse the coalition and trigger new elections. Ben-Gvir had initially set demands that seemed unrealistic, including the dismissal of Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara and Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar. However, Netanyahu delivered on those demands. Now, the third condition — renewed military action in Gaza — has been met, potentially paving the way for Ben-Gvir’s return to the government and stabilizing the coalition. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The opposition accused Netanyahu of making security decisions based on political considerations while neglecting the hostages’ fate. Ben-Gvir, already preparing his return to government, welcomed the military escalation. 'As we have said for months since we withdrew: Israel must return to fighting in Gaza,' his party said in a statement. 'This is the right, moral and justified step. To destroy Hamas and bring our hostages home, we cannot allow the terror group to exist — it must be eliminated.' Democrats party leader Yair Golan criticized Netanyahu, saying that 'Netanyahu is sacrificing hostages and soldiers' lives because he fears protests over the Shin Bet chief’s dismissal — the public must rise up.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hymym9inyl	2025-03-18T00:24:26-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/SyOv0J6g5kg/SyOv0J6g5kg_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Allegations claim public education funds were misused to produce a politically affiliated children’s newspaper, leading to the detention of Education Ministry minister Haim Biton and three others The Israel Police's National Fraud Investigation Unit of Lahav 433 opened an investigation after public funds intended for education were allegedly diverted to produce and distribute a children's newspaper affiliated with the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, Ynet learned on Tuesday. Police detained four suspects, including a government minister. According to investigators, the probe has been ongoing for several months, focusing on suspected fraud, breach of trust, falsification of corporate documents and money laundering. Authorities suspect that budgeted education funds were unlawfully used to finance the publication and distribution of a children’s supplement in 'HaDerech', a privately owned newspaper published by the Shas-affiliated Ma’ayan HaChinuch HaTorani school network.

IDF warns Gazans to evacuate areas near border with Israel amid r...	The warning came hours after the cease-fire in Gaza ended late on Monday as the Air Force launched extensive strikes on Gaza in operation dubbed ‘Strength and Sword’; Schools closed in Gaza border area and rail service suspended as Home Front Command recommends preparing shelters throughout country The IDF Spokesperson in Arabic Avichay Adraee on Tuesday morning issued a warning to Gaza residents in areas of Gaza including in the neighborhoods of Beit Hanoun, Khirbet Khaza'a, Abasan al-Kabira and al-Jedida to evacuate due to the IDF offensive. The warning came hours after the cease-fire in Gaza ended late on Monday as the Air Force launched extensive strikes on the Gaza Strip in an operation dubbed ‘Strength and Sword’. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement issued by this office that he had instructed the military to take 'strong action' against Hamas in Gaza in response to the group's refusal to release hostages and rejection of all ceasefire proposals. 'Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength.' The IDF Arabic spokesman posted in his statement Tuesday morning that the IDF 'has launched a powerful offensive against the terrorist organizations. These specific areas are considered dangerous combat zones. For your safety, you must evacuate immediately to the known shelters in western Gaza City and Khan Younis. Continuing to remain in the designated areas endangers your lives and the lives of your family members.' The areas delineated on the map accompanying the statement run along the Gaza-Israeli border. At the same time, the IDF's Home Front Command advised Israelis to prepare shelters across the country following recent air strikes in the Gaza Strip, the unit's spokesperson Col. (res) Chilik Soffer told Ynet on Tuesday. 'In most areas, there’s no immediate threat, but every citizen must be ready to act at a moment’s notice — not just in border areas,' Soffer said. 'I recommend preparing shelters everywhere. We don’t know what tomorrow will bring.' Earlier on Tuesday the IDF said that it would close the Rafah border crossing from Gaza to Egypt. Some 5 wounded and sick people had been crossing through Rafah daily, in accordance with the cease-fire agreement. Other border crossings into Gaza have been closed for the past two weeks. Military officials said the surprise attack on the Strip comes after hundreds of new targets were identified during the two months of truce and 20,000 terrorists from the Hamas and Islamic Jihad took up positions in Gaza adding that it was prepared to continue attacks against Hamas commanders and infrastructure in Gaza for as long as needed and would expand the campaign beyond airstrikes. The IDF said the targets included senior Hamas leaders, tunnels and weapons storage facilities in a surprise attack on dozens of sites in order to maximize damage. At this stage the renewal of the war is an air operation only and does not involve a ground entry back into Gaza. Israel wants to give Hamas an opportunity to advance in negotiations toward a deal, or at least another breakthrough. The operation also has involved Navy missile ships, including the new ship named Victory. The ships attacked Hamas targets near the Gaza coast. The IDF ordered schools in Gaza border communities closed following a late-night security assessment. In addition, train service between Ashkelon and Sderot was also suspended, with shuttle buses operating in its place. Israel Railways said service would resume once security clearance is granted. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry has reported that 254 people were killed in airstrikes and more than 440 were injured. The ministry said efforts were ongoing to rescue victims from the rubble. The number was revised downward from an initial report of more than 300 Gazan deaths. A senior Hamas official accused Israel of unilaterally overturning the ceasefire agreement. 'We call on the mediators to assign full responsibility on Netanyahu and Israel for violating the cease-fire agreement, Hamas said. the group called on the Arab League to stand by the Palestinian resistance and to break the unjust siege placed on the Gaza Strip. Hamas also called on the UN Security Council to urgently convene and force Israel to stop the war. > Meanwhile, the Houthis have condemned what it calls the 'Israeli aggression' on Gaza. The organization said it 'vows to continue the escalation' against Israel. In photos and video released from the Israeli Air Force command and control bunker overnight, embattled Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar can be seen in consultation with IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir. A Cabinet meeting has been set to be held on Tuesday to fire the internal security head, though it remains unclear whether such a meeting will take place. According to Palestinian reports, at least five senior members of Hamas were killed in the overnight airstrikes, including Mahmoud Abu Watfa Dir. General of the Hamas Interior Ministry who was in charge of the Hamas police force. He redeployed police forces charged with civilian obedience and order and was seen in a video last January vowing to rebuild the Strip and Hamas's rule. Among the leaders who were killed were also two members of the Hamas political bureau, Issam Aldialis and Mohammad Al-Jmasi, the commander of internal security and the director-general of the Hamas Justice Ministry. All of those senior officials, targeted by Israel played central roles in the rebuilding of Hamas rule over the Strip after the fighting stopped and the cease-fire came into effect. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjx2cclhke	2025-03-17T23:50:17-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/18/B100Ga9UhJx/B100Ga9UhJx_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

IDF says Hamas rebuilds military structure, uses tunnels not uncovered in war and uses humanitarian aid to increase revenue under protection of the cease-fire Israeli security officials said they had observed increasing efforts by Hamas to target IDF troops in the Gaza Strip and launch attacks on Israeli communities across the border before Israel launched its surprise attack ending the fragile cease-fire. Defense officials warned in recent weeks that Hamas was rehabilitating its capacities under the protection of the cease-fire and rebuilding its military forces. They also said the terror group had not abandoned its intentions to attack Israel as it had during the October 7 massacre. Thousands of Hamas terrorists returned to the northern areas of the Strip after the IDF withdrew from the Netzarim corridor, embedded in the civilian population that moved north from displacement camps in the south. They joined the thousands of terrorists that remained in northern Gaza during the fighting. Hamas's rebuilding efforts, the officials warned, include reorganizing its battalions and brigades, using underground tunnels that were not discovered or building new ones, clearing IEDs placed by the terrorists from areas repopulated by civilians and placing new ones in anticipation of an incursion, and setting up rocket launchers and cameras. Hamas likely learned from Israel's offensive and repeated raids. The officials said the terror group had not exhausted its entire force during the war after it understood that it would be fighting Israel alone and that Hezbollah would not open a new front against Israel. > The security forces said the identified Hamas use of civilian needs to rebuild its economic strength as well, taking control of municipalities across the Strip. The terror group set up roadblocks and took control of hundreds of tons of humanitarian aid, fuel and water that was brought into the Strip daily as part of the cease-fire agreement. Hamas began collecting taxes and demanding pay for humanitarian aid from the civilian population so that it could pay its operatives. 'Hamas was able to move its commanders and relay orders, every day during the cease-fire. It may have suffered losses in commanders and weapons thanks to the activity of the IDF and a lack of new resources but there is still much work to be done before it is defeated,' IDF officials said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sksa6uu3kl	2025-03-17T19:13:01-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/19/BkxGwa9w1e/BkxGwa9w1e_0_159_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
US consulted ahead of strikes on Gaza, WH says	White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt says terrorists in the Middle East should take Trump seriously when he says he is not afraid to stand for the American friend and our ally, Israel Israel consulted with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump ahead of its surprise attack on Gaza late on Monday, ending the fragile cease-fire. 'The Trump administration and the White House were consulted by the Israelis on their attacks in Gaza tonight,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a Fox News interview. Israel said it was conducting extensive air strikes on Hamas and Islamic Jihad targets after Hamas refused to release hostages and was rebuilding its strength during the months of truce. 'As President Trump has made it clear - Hamas, the Houthis, Iran, all those who seek to terrorize not just Israel, but also the United States of America, will see a price to pay. All hell will break loose,' the White House spokesperson said. Trump had previously publicly warned using similar words, saying that Hamas should release all hostages in Gaza or 'let hell break out.' > 'All of the terrorists in the Middle East... should take President Trump very seriously when he says he is not afraid to stand for law-abiding people and he is not afraid to stand up for the United States of America and our friend and our ally, Israel,' Leavitt said. Washington separately launched a new wave of airstrikes on Saturday in Yemen in which it said dozens of members of the Houthi movement were left dead. The Houthis said at least 53 people were killed. Reuters could not independently verify those casualty numbers.

Lebanon and Syria agree to ceasefire after 2 days of border clash...	Lebanese and Syrian defense officials reached an agreement late Monday for a ceasefire to halt two days of clashes along the border, Syria's state-run SANA news agency reported. The agreement also stipulates 'enhanced coordination and cooperation between the two sides,' the statement from the Syrian Ministry of Defense said. Lebanon's president earlier Monday ordered troops to retaliate against the source of gunfire from the Syrian side of the border after more deadly fighting erupted overnight along the frontier. Lebanon's Health Ministry reported that seven Lebanese citizens were killed and another 52 injured in the clashes, including a 4-year-old girl. The fighting happened after Syria's interim government accused militants from Lebanon's Hezbollah group of crossing into Syria on Saturday, abducting three soldiers and killing them on Lebanese soil. Hezbollah denied involvement and some other reports pointed to local clans in the border region that are not directly affiliated with Hezbollah but have been involved in cross-border smuggling. It was the most serious cross-border fighting since the ouster of former Syrian President Bashar Assad in December.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hycj2fu3kl	2025-03-17T14:06:40-07:00

They put a bag over my head and tied me up': Israeli escapes kid...	Israeli music producer Itay Kashti narrowly escaped a kidnapping attempt in Wales by 3 Muslims who lured him to an alleged business meeting; Judge says kidnapping attempt had antisemitic motives and that 'the kidnappers were inspired by events occurring elsewhere in the world' Israeli music producer Itay Kashti, who resides in Britain, fell victim to a dramatic kidnapping attempt in Wales. In an interview with Ynet, he recounts how he narrowly escaped his captors at the last moment. It all began in August when Kashti, a music producer with an active studio, received what appeared to be a professional inquiry. 'I got an email from someone claiming to represent a major record label,' Kashti recalls. 'It sounded legitimate, so we arranged a meeting in Wales.' Kashti did not suspect anything was amiss. 'When we arrived at the location, it looked like a standard guesthouse. At first, it seemed nice, but then the suspicious signs began to appear.' According to him, within seconds of entering the premises, three armed men stormed in and attacked him and the taxi driver who had brought him there. 'They put a bag over my head and tied me up,' he remembers. 'I was in shock and didn’t understand what was happening.' > The taxi driver was struck in the face but managed to escape, while Kashti was subdued by his attackers with kicks and blows. He was tied to a radiator but managed to exploit a moment of inattention from his captors to free himself. 'They weren’t skilled enough. When one of them moved away, I managed to free myself from the restraints, get up and run outside,' he recounts. After escaping, Kashti hid in some bushes and called his wife and the police. The three kidnappers were later apprehended by police that same day as they tried to hide in a nearby field. British police launched an investigation and filed charges against the kidnappers. Initially, the motive for the incident was unclear, but it was later revealed that the kidnappers were British citizens of Muslim descent: Mohammad Comrie, 23, from Leeds, Faiz Shah, 23, from Bradford, and Elijah Ogunnubi-Sime, 20, from Wallington, London. 'They weren’t wearing keffiyehs or anything like that. These are ordinary British citizens,' Kashti explains. The court sentenced the three to eight years in prison. Although they did not explicitly clarify their motives, the judge determined that the act had both financial and nationalist motives. 'Mr. Kashti was targeted because of his Jewish background,' the judge in Swansea court stated. 'The kidnappers were inspired by events occurring elsewhere in the world.' Kashti is also convinced that the act had nationalist motives. 'They talked about Allah during their conversations. I can’t say if it was 90% nationalist or 30%, but it was there.' 'In those moments, I didn’t know if I would make it out alive,' he admits. 'You just try to survive.' Today, the kidnappers are behind bars, but for Kashti the experience left a deep mark. 'What matters is that I’m here, and they’re there,' he says. The incident has raised many concerns among the Israeli community in Britain regarding their personal safety. 'This could happen to anyone,' he concludes. 'The world has become a dangerous place, even when all you want to do is create music.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjmsezi2jx	2025-03-17T13:27:40-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/17/ryF8MlL3Jx/ryF8MlL3Jx_0_647_1063_599_0_small.jpg

Israel’s Flotilla 7: Uncovering secrets of the Navy's first subma...	Flotilla 7, Israel’s elite submarine unit, operates in near-total secrecy; From the arrival of its first submarine, INS Tanin, to the tragedy of the INS Dakar, here’s a rare glimpse into its history, traditions and evolving fleet In December 1959, a new chapter in Israel’s naval history began with the arrival of its first submarine, the INS Tanin (Israeli Naval Ship Crocodile), at the port of Haifa. This event marked the birth of Flotilla 7, a unit that would go on to become one of the most secretive and operationally significant divisions in the Israeli Defense Forces. While much of its activity remains classified, the following insights shed light on the unit’s evolution, traditions and legacy. A new frontier in naval warfare The INS Tanin’s arrival wasn’t just a milestone for Israel’s Navy — it was a leap into uncharted waters. To prepare for this new era, a team of Israeli sailors was sent to France and England to undergo specialized training on submarine operations. This practice of training abroad has since become a standard procedure, ensuring that every crew is fully equipped to handle the advanced technology of their submarines. Cloak and dagger missions Flotilla 7’s operations are shrouded in mystery, with only two missions ever revealed to the public. During the Six-Day War, the unit played a pivotal role in Alexandria, working alongside Flotilla 13 to confront Egyptian naval forces. Years later, during the Lebanon War, the flotilla undertook a critical intelligence-gathering mission. These glimpses into its activities highlight the unit’s importance in both combat and reconnaissance. The Dakar tragedy and its legacy One of the most haunting chapters in Flotilla 7’s history is the disappearance of the INS Dakar in 1968. The submarine vanished during its voyage from England to Israel, and all crew members aboard were lost. A year later, a life belt from the Dakar washed ashore on Gaza’s coast, sparking extensive but fruitless searches near Egypt. It wasn’t until 1999 — 31 years after its disappearance — that the submarine’s wreckage was discovered deep in the Mediterranean, 480 kilometers off Haifa’s coast. In 2024, the Israeli Navy honored the Dakar’s legacy by naming its sixth submarine the INS Drakon, a reimagining of the Dakar’s name, to commemorate the vessel and its fallen crew. > A tradition of brotherhood Flotilla 7’s submariners share a unique bond, symbolized by a long-standing tradition. Upon completing their rigorous training, each graduate signs his or her name in 'The Submariner’s Book,' a green-bound volume that serves as a testament to their achievement and their entry into this elite unit. This tradition fosters a sense of unity and pride among the crew. A world of secrets Even within the unit, secrecy is paramount. Submariners-in-training are not briefed on the nature of Flotilla 7’s missions or its operational scope. Only after completing their training and joining their assigned submarine do they gain access to the classified details of their assignments. This veil of secrecy underscores the sensitive and high-stakes nature of their work. Evolving technology, evolving fleet Over the decades, Flotilla 7’s fleet has undergone significant transformations. The unit’s first submarines, the S and T classes, were British vessels built during World War II. These were eventually replaced by the smaller, more agile 'Gal' class submarines in the late 1970s, designed specifically for Israel’s operational needs. In the 2000s, the Navy introduced the 'Dolphin' class submarines, which were later upgraded to the 'Dolphin AIP' model. These state-of-the-art vessels are equipped with advanced systems that allow for extended underwater missions, reflecting the flotilla’s commitment to staying at the forefront of naval technology. A symbol of honor In 2023, Flotilla 7 unveiled a redesigned emblem that pays tribute to its history and achievements. The new design features a Dolphin-class submarine, representing the unit’s current capabilities, alongside a swordfish, a nod to the INS Dakar and its fallen crew. The emblem’s blue tones symbolize the vast maritime domain, while the red highlights the covert nature of the flotilla’s operations behind enemy lines. From its humble beginnings with the INS Tanin to its current status as a cutting-edge naval force, Flotilla 7 has played a vital role in Israel’s defense. Its legacy is one of innovation, resilience and unwavering dedication to protecting the nation’s security. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rjhqojl21e	2025-03-17T12:21:48-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/17/Sye5LeLnJx/Sye5LeLnJx_94_32_776_437_0_small.jpg

US airstrikes on Yemen fuels anti-American sentiment, bolsters Ho...	As the US defends its strikes as necessary for maritime security, analysts warn that civilian casualties may strengthen Houthi opposition and deepen regional instability The United States intensified its military involvement in Yemen by launching over the weekend a series of airstrikes targeting the Iran-aligned Houthis. While the escalation is intended to curtail the Houthis’ ability to disrupt critical international shipping routes in the Red Sea, it has resulted in substantial civilian casualties and raised regional tensions, prompting varied reactions from both global and local analysts. According to the Houthi-run Health Ministry, at least 53 people — including women and children — have so far been killed, and nearly 100 others injured in the U.S. strikes. U.S. officials report that the attacks hit multiple Houthi strongholds, including in the capital Sanaa and the strategic port of Hodeidah. These locations serve as military hubs while also being densely populated urban centers. In a significant escalation, Houthi rebels claimed responsibility Monday morning for attacking the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman twice within 24 hours. The group reported launching 18 ballistic and cruise missiles, along with drones, targeting the carrier and its accompanying vessels in the Red Sea. Although U.S. defense officials have not confirmed these claims, they acknowledged intercepting and destroying drones fired by the Houthis near the carrier group. Divergent perspectives on the US intervention The U.S. administration defends the airstrikes as essential measures to protect international maritime commerce. President Donald Trump emphasized the need to keep shipping lanes open and secure, stating: 'We will use overwhelming lethal force.' Analysts, however, offer contrasting views on the effectiveness and consequences of this military strategy. 'The notion of ‘targeted attacks’ is, frankly, ridiculous. The U.S.-UK coalition claims to be striking military sites, but every time they do, civilians die. This time, the casualties are higher — over 50 dead. In previous attacks, the numbers were much lower — four or five at most. When we examine the images, it’s clear who is being hit and, often, these sites were identified based on outdated geolocations,' Laura Battaglia, Italian journalist and Yemeni affairs expert, said. Steven Turner, an American political analyst, acknowledges the strategic rationale behind U.S. actions but cautions about potential unintended outcomes. 'While the objective is to safeguard international shipping, the collateral damage, particularly civilian casualties, could fuel anti-American sentiments and bolster the Houthis’ resolve,' he said. A Yemeni political analyst, who requested anonymity, provided insight into local perceptions of the current strikes. 'In the southern regions of Yemen, where opposition to the Houthis has traditionally been strong, there’s a growing resentment towards foreign interventions. This sentiment is leading to an unexpected shift, with some southern communities now expressing support for the Houthis as a form of resistance against external aggression,' he said. 'On top of that, the current Yemeni Saudi-backed government is not supported by the people, while the Houthis have proven that they have been fighting for Palestine and against imperialist powers more than anyone could have expected. They also keep providing good public services in the areas they control more than the government has ever done. Sanaa today is so modern and well taken care of,' he added. Battaglia contextualizes the situation within the broader geopolitical landscape. 'The U.S. airstrikes are not isolated incidents; they are intertwined with the strategic interests of regional powers like Saudi Arabia and the UAE. These nations have vested interests in Yemen’s stability and are likely influencing, if not directly supporting the US military actions,' she explained. Historical context: Past US bombings in Yemen The United States has a long history of military interventions in Yemen, primarily targeting al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The current operations, however, differ in both scope and target as they focus directly on Houthi rebels. This change marks a broader engagement in Yemen’s internal conflict and raises questions about the long-term implications for regional stability. 'Previous U.S. operations in Yemen were narrowly focused on counterterrorism. The current strategy indicates a more direct involvement in the Yemeni civil war, which could entangle the US in a protracted and complex conflict,' according to Turner. 'The Trump administration was particularly attentive to Yemen, much more so than the Biden administration. Let’s not forget that Trump’s first military operation was in southern Yemen, targeting remnants of the Awlaki family along with al-Qaida operatives. The difference now is that the U.S. is engaging Yemen under the pretext of deterrence against Iran as part of a broader regional strategy that also involves Saudi Arabia’s nuclear ambitions,' Battaglia added. The Houthis: Its military capabilities and previous failures The Houthi movement has evolved from a localized insurgency into a formidable military force. Equipped with advanced weaponry — including drones and missiles allegedly supplied by Iran — the Houthis have demonstrated the capability to strike targets beyond Yemen’s borders. The group's resilience is bolstered by a decentralized command structure and a deep-rooted ideological commitment. Battaglia says that the group shows a great deal of adaptability. 'The Houthis have shown a remarkable ability to adapt both militarily and politically. Their decentralized structure makes them a challenging adversary for conventional military forces,' she said. 'Beyond heavy weaponry, medium-sized artillery is commonplace in Yemen. Every household has a Kalashnikov or a sniper rifle. This is a country where armed resistance is part of life. The Saudis, the UK, and the Americans have struggled to gain an upper hand because they failed to understand this fundamental reality. They have underestimated this militia,' she added. Saudi Arabia and the UAE: Strategic allies and potential targets Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have been pivotal allies in the coalition against the Houthis. Their strategic locations and military bases, some of which host U.S. forces, position them as potential targets for Houthi retaliation. The Houthis have previously launched missile attacks against Saudi infrastructure, and an escalation could see similar threats directed at the UAE. Battaglia underscores the stakes for regional powers. 'The involvement of Saudi Arabia and the UAE is not merely supportive; they are integral to the coalition’s operations. This alliance makes them susceptible to direct attacks, which could destabilize the broader Gulf region,' she said. > 'There’s always a risk of attacks on U.S. bases in the region. But this is nothing new, and we are prepared for that scenario. U.S. installations in the Middle East are always under some level of threat, whether from Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, the Houthis in Yemen or other militant factions,' Turner noted. The Yemeni analyst commented: 'The Houthis have explicitly threatened to target U.S. military bases in the region as a counter-response. Such actions could inadvertently drag neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain into direct conflict, further destabilizing the region and going against the plan of these countries to invest in peace and prosperity in the area, as mentioned in their 2030 agendas. In this phase, Israel may not even been targeted.' He also explained how the perception of Yemenis toward these countries has changed over the years. 'At the start of the war in 2015, many Yemenis in the south welcomed the Saudis and the Emiratis. They believed the coalition would help free Yemen from Houthi control. But now, after years of failed policies, detentions, torture, and economic mismanagement, that support has eroded completely,' he added. Future of the conflict: Uncertain trajectory As the situation in Yemen intensifies, experts remain divided about its future course. 'For now, the U.S. is taking action to protect shipping. Whether that escalates into something larger is yet to be seen,' Turner stated. 'But one thing is clear — this is not the end of the Houthi threat at least a full ground invasion like in Gaza is made, but nobody will take that responsibility at the moment,' he concluded. Battaglia added, 'The Houthis have proven that they do not scare easily. If they are attacked, they will respond. The question is not whether they will retaliate, but how in the long term.' An anonymous Yemeni analyst also concluded that 'This war will not end with airstrikes. The Houthis are deeply entrenched in Yemeni society. Removing them would require more than military action — it would require a complete restructuring of Yemen’s political order, which no foreign power has the capacity to achieve right now.' The U.S. seeks to deter Houthi aggression in the Red Sea, but its actions may inadvertently embolden the group. It is still not clear whether this latest military intervention will achieve its intended goal or simply add another chapter to the region’s turmoil.

Doctor deported to Lebanon had photos 'sympathetic' to Hezbollah ...	U.S. authorities on Monday said they deported a Rhode Island doctor to Lebanon last week after discovering 'sympathetic photos and videos' of the former longtime leader of Hezbollah and other terrorists on her cell phone's deleted items folder. Rasha Alawieh had also told agents that while in Lebanon she attended the funeral last month of Hezbollah's slain leader Hassan Nasrallah, whom she supported from a 'religious perspective' as a Shi'ite Muslim. The U.S. Department of Justice provided those details as it sought to assure a federal judge in Boston that U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not willfully disobey an order he issued on Friday that should have halted Dr. Rasha Alawieh's immediate removal. The 34-year-old Lebanese citizen, who held an H-1B visa, was detained on Thursday at Logan International Airport in Boston after returning from a trip to Lebanon to see family. Her cousin then filed a lawsuit seeking to halt her deportation. In its first public explanation for her removal, the Justice Department said Alawieh, a kidney specialist and assistant professor at Brown University, was denied re-entry to the United States based on what CBP found on her phone and statements she made during an airport interview. In Monday's filing, the Justice Department also defended CBP officials against claims by the cousin's legal team that Alawieh was flown out of the country on Friday evening in violation of an order issued by U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin that day. The judge had issued an order barring Alawieh's removal from Massachusetts without 48 hours' notice. Yet she was put onto a flight to France that night and is now back in Lebanon.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjmlrab3je	2025-03-17T09:43:05-07:00

In addition to the one-time distribution of cards during holidays last year, this time the card will be loaded with funds quarterly to ensure the ongoing welfare of Holocaust survivors, in addition to the annual compensation they receive. The distribution of the Claims Conference food cards is carried out in cooperation with the Eshel Chabad organization, and with the support fund of the German Federal Ministry of Finance.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjb9ucb31l	2025-03-17T09:17:13-07:00	
Landmines in Syria claim over 200 lives as refugees return	More than 200 returning refugees, including children, have been killed by landmines in Syria since Assad’s fall; Experts warn it could take decades to clear war remnants, leaving entire areas unsafe for returnees More than 200 returning refugees, including women and children, have been killed in Syria by landmine explosions and other leftover munitions in the three months since the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime. The number of casualties continues to rise as approximately 1.2 million Syrians return to their homes and lands after being displaced during the civil war. Across Syria, thousands of landmines and unexploded shells remain scattered after 14 years of war, both in major cities and rural areas where battles between the Syrian army and rebel groups took place. Bomb disposal experts quoted in the British Guardian stated that currently, 'there is no safe area in Syria.' According to the Halo Trust organization, which works to clear landmines, as of last week, 640 Syrians have been killed or injured by unexploded munitions that remain in the area. According to a report published by the United Nations, one-third of the victims are children, some of whom mistook the mines and shells for toys. 'We cannot say there is any area in Syria free of war remnants,' said Mohammad Sami al-Mohammad, a bomb disposal expert working for the White Helmets aid organization, as quoted in the Guardian. > He added that it would take decades to clear the mines and make Syria safe. 'There are countries where wars ended 40 years ago, and they still haven’t completely eradicated this danger. It’s not that simple, and what happened in Syria is far more devastating compared to other places,' he said. Volunteers are helping residents returning to their homes to clear mines from the area, but they too are sometimes injured or even killed during the demining process. Today, an annual conference aimed at raising funds for Syria will open in Brussels. Syria has been suffering from humanitarian issues and instability since the fall of Assad. The conference, organized by the European Union since 2017, was previously held without representation from the Syrian regime during Assad's rule. This time, under the new regime led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, Damascus will send a representative: Assad al-Shibani, the foreign minister of the transitional government. Ministers and representatives from Western countries, Arab states, and UN agencies will attend the conference in Brussels. Until this year, the conference primarily focused on aiding Syrian refugees in Europe. Participating countries avoided direct contact with the Syrian regime and directed their donations to the UN and aid organizations working for Syrians. Now, after Assad's ousting, Europe hopes Syria will embark on a new and more stable path. However, the conference is taking place just a week after the massacres of civilians from Syria's Alawite minority. These Alawites were executed during fierce clashes between the security forces of the new regime and armed loyalists of the previous regime. 'This is a time of critical challenges and needs for Syria, as we tragically saw in the recent wave of violence in the coastal regions,' said Kaja Kallas, the European Union's foreign minister. European officials noted that the conference is particularly important given that, under Donald Trump's leadership, the United States is dramatically cutting humanitarian aid and development programs worldwide. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bypf4pb2ye	2025-03-17T08:57:02-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/17/Bklbn5rhJl/Bklbn5rhJl_396_417_2605_1467_0_small.jpg

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Monday that he had proposed at a European Union meeting for sanctions to be placed on those behind attacks against Syria's Alawites. Syria has been hit with widespread violence over the last few weeks, after Syria's Sunni Islamist-led authorities said their security forces came under attack by militants loyal to the ousted president, Bashar Assad, whose Alawite family come from the coastal region. The attack unleashed widespread killings targeting Alawites, marking the worst bloodshed since Assad was toppled in December after 14 years of war.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryibuarnje	2025-03-17T08:04:54-07:00

Trump blames Iran for Houthi attacks, vows 'dire' consequences fo...	US president's social media post says attacks by Houthis will be 'met with great force, and there is no guarantee that that force will stop there'; Post comes after tens of thousands in Yemen demonstrate to support Houthis and to protest the U.S. bombings, gathering in Sanaa and other cities with Palestinian flags and Korans chanting 'Death to America! Death to Israel!' U.S. President Donald Trump blamed Iran for Houthi attacks in a post on Monday on his social media platform Truth Social, and threatened to attack Iran in retaliation. 'Let nobody be fooled! The hundreds of attacks being made by Houthi, the sinister mobsters and thugs based in Yemen, who are hated by the Yemeni people, all emanate from, and are created by, IRAN. Any further attack or retaliation by the 'Houthis' will be met with great force, and there is no guarantee that that force will stop there,' Trump wrote. He added that 'Iran has played 'the innocent victim' of rogue terrorists from which they’ve lost control, but they haven’t lost control. They’re dictating every move, giving them the weapons, supplying them with money and highly sophisticated Military equipment, and even, so-called, 'Intelligence.' Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!' The post came after tens of thousands of people who support the Houthi regime gathered Monday afternoon in a massive demonstration in Yemen’s capital, Sanaa. The rally was intended as a show of force by the Iran-backed group in response to the wave of U.S. airstrikes launched against it beginning on Saturday night. During the demonstration, which was broadcast live on the Houthis’ Al-Masirah television network, crowds chanted familiar slogans: 'Death to America! Death to Israel!' In Sanaa’s main square, protesters waved Yemeni and Palestinian flags, held rifles, and carried signs and copies of the Quran. 'Yemen will never back down! We challenge the Americans and the Zionists,' one speaker declared through a microphone, rousing the crowd. Similar demonstrations were also held in other Houthi-controlled areas, including Saada, Hudaydah, Dhamar, and Amran. The mass protests were called for by Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, who urged Yemenis on Sunday to take to the streets 'by the millions' to protest the American airstrikes. The U.S. military launched the offensive over the weekend on orders from President Donald Trump, following the Houthis’ announcement that the group had resumed attacks on ships 'linked to Israel' in the Red Sea, disrupting international shipping lanes. The Houthi attacks, which the group claims are acts of solidarity with Gaza, have significantly impacted global maritime trade since October 2023, forcing vessels to avoid the Suez Canal in favor of longer, safer routes and driving up insurance costs. Upon launching the strikes on Saturday, President Trump vowed that 'hell' awaited the Houthis and declared, 'Your time is up.' According to U.S. officials, several senior Houthi commanders have been killed since the strikes began. The Houthis, for their part, claim at least 53 people have been killed and 98 wounded in the American strikes, including civilians, among them five children and two women. Washington has indicated the military campaign could last for weeks. > Al-Masirah TV reported that U.S. airstrikes continued Monday, targeting Houthi positions in the port city of Hudaydah and the al-Jawf region north of Sanaa. In retaliation, the Houthis claimed they launched two attacks in the past 24 hours against the USS Harry S. Truman in the northern Red Sea. However, they have yet to provide any evidence to support these claims. Houthi leaders warned that attacks on shipping in the Red Sea would continue as long as the U.S. military strikes Yemen. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skstr3b2yg	2025-03-17T07:54:56-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/17/HkhNi2r31x/HkhNi2r31x_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Trump's plan: Send Gazans to Syria, too	Trump administration is planning to settle Gazans in Syria as well, CBS News reports, but for now the new regime has not confirmed that it has received such a request; Meanwhile, Sky News in Arabic reported that the administration has actually accepted the Egyptian plan and is pressuring Israel to agree to a committee of technocrats to run Gaza In addition to previously disclosed outreach to Somalia, Somaliland and Sudan about potentially resettling Palestinians from Gaza, the United States is also exploring the option of transferring Palestinians to Syria, CBS News reported Monday afternoon. According to the CBS report, the Trump administration attempted to approach Syria’s new government through a third party. However, it remains unclear whether there has been any response from Damascus. A Syrian official denied receiving any such request. Meanwhile, Sky News Arabia reported that the Trump administration has given preliminary approval to Egypt’s proposal for post-war Gaza, a plan that has gained backing from several Arab and European countries. According to the report, the U.S. is pressuring Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to the formation of a Palestinian 'technocratic committee' to govern Gaza with Arab and international support. Washington has tied its support for the plan to the removal of Hamas from power and its disarmament, and has consulted with Egypt on the feasibility of eliminating Hamas from Gaza’s political and administrative landscape. CBS, citing three sources familiar with the discussions, reported that relocating Palestinians to other countries is one of several ideas the Trump team is considering to end the war between Israel and Hamas and to facilitate Gaza’s reconstruction. President Trump stated during a meeting on Wednesday with Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin that 'no one is deporting Palestinians,' responding to a question about his controversial remarks the previous month. At the time, Trump had proposed during a White House meeting with Netanyahu that the U.S. take control of Gaza and rebuild it. Trump had also suggested Gaza could become the 'Riviera of the Middle East' and emphasized the need to 'end the death and destruction' there. Two diplomatic sources told CBS that Israeli and U.S. officials have already approached Somalia and Sudan about absorbing Palestinians. One source noted that Trump’s remarks have increased Israel’s motivation to engage other nations in discussions about taking in Gazans. > Somalia’s ambassador to the U.S., Dahir Hassan, told CBS that neither the U.S. administration nor Israel has made any formal approach to the Somali government about accepting Palestinians. He warned that spreading unverified information of this kind could increase recruitment efforts by extremist groups such as ISIS and Al-Shabaab, endangering regional security. The Sudanese government has not responded to the report. Syria’s new government, led by President Ahmad al-Sharaa, also known as Mohammed al-Jolani, has been in power for only three months, following the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime to rebel forces. Sudan, meanwhile, remains mired in a civil war and faces a severe refugee and famine crisis. Over the past two decades, tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees have sought asylum in Israel, with many detained in immigration facilities or living without official status. Since his February 4 joint press conference with Netanyahu, Trump has stated that Palestinians will have a choice whether to leave Gaza, though he has also suggested that such departures could be permanent. In an interview with Fox News days later, Trump said, 'We’ll build beautiful communities, safe communities—five, six, maybe two. But we’ll build safe communities a little farther away from where they are now.' In the same interview, he asserted that Palestinians would not have the right to return to Gaza, claiming the territory is 'uninhabitable' and will remain so for years. Many Arab countries, the United Nations, and several Democratic lawmakers have condemned Trump’s Gaza proposal, with some labeling it 'ethnic cleansing.' Last week, Arab leaders approved Egypt’s alternative plan to rehabilitate Gaza after the war. However, both the Trump administration and Israel swiftly rejected it, arguing that Gaza is no longer suitable for habitation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkqzv2hhyl	2025-03-17T07:06:03-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/BkKUHcDYJe/BkKUHcDYJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Israeli airstrikes in Gaza amid stalled cease-fire talks, targete...	Palestinians report three killed in central Gaza, and three others wounded in Rafah; Defense Minister Israel Katz vows 'zero tolerance' for Hezbollah after Hezbollah operative killed in drone strike Israeli airstrikes killed at least three Hamas terrorists in Gaza on Monday, according to Palestinian medics, as cease-fire talks between Israel and Hamas showed no signs of progress. Meanwhile, Israel also struck Hezbollah operatives in southern Lebanon, as regional tensions escalated. The IDF said it carried out an airstrike targeting three Hamas terrorists in the Al-Bureij area of central Gaza, claiming they were attempting to plant explosives. Medics in Gaza confirmed the deaths, stating the men were hit by a missile fired from a drone near the Bureij refugee camp. In a separate attack, three people were wounded in an airstrike in Rafah, the southernmost city in the Gaza Strip, according to medics. Residents have reported frequent fire from Israeli forces stationed near the border. Earlier Palestinian media outlets reported Israel's naval vessels firing toward Gaza City. The persistent violence underscores the fragility of a cease-fire proposal mediated by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States. Israel has pushed to extend the first phase of the deal, a proposal supported by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. Hamas, however, insists it will resume hostage releases only under the second phase, which was set to begin on March 2. 'Hamas has complied fully with the agreement, while the occupation (Israel) didn't comply with some clauses,' Hamas spokesperson Abdel-Latif Al-Qanoua said Monday, accusing Israel of trying to undermine the agreement and impose new conditions. On Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said negotiators had been instructed to be ready to continue talks based on the mediators' response to a U.S. proposal for the release of 11 living hostages and half of the dead captives. Last Friday, Hamas said it had agreed to release American-Israeli soldier Edan Alexander and the bodies of four hostages if Israel agreed to begin immediate negotiations on implementing the second phase of the agreement. Israel dismissed the offer as 'psychological warfare' targeting hostage families. > On Monday Defense Minister Israel Katz confirmed that Israeli forces struck Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon’s Yakhmour al-Shakif area. 'Our policy is clear: zero tolerance for any violation,' Katz said. 'We will not allow Hezbollah to rebuild its capabilities. Any terrorist attempting to harm Israeli citizens is as good as dead. Those who test us will witness our strength.' The Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese television channel Al-Manar reported that a drone strike hit a vehicle in the same area. Lebanese broadcaster LBCI reported that one person was killed. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1aa4chhyx	2025-03-17T04:57:20-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/17/HJEkJKHnkx/HJEkJKHnkx_0_241_900_507_0_small.jpg

From Soviet tanks to Nazi-era guns: IDF seized wealth of weapons ...	Military's Enemy Assets Unit grapples with over 180,000 confiscated weapons while balancing legal protocols, ethical concerns and potential military reuse One evening last November, deputy commander of the IDF's Enemy Assets Confiscation Unit, Lt. Col. (res.) Idan Sharon-Kettler convened a periodic summary meeting with his Military Intelligence Directorate counterparts at the intelligence collection and technical spoils unit — known by its Hebrew acronym Amshat. This meeting, held as the IDF was preparing to wrap up the ground operation and declare a ceasefire, was attended by reservist officers who could relax over a coffee and, with a sense of satisfaction, review the period they’d just finished up, removing thousands of weapons from southern Lebanon. This followed gathering tens of thousands of weapons from the Gaza Strip over the past year. 'Come on. Let’s open a booty collection point at the Quneitra crossing too,' suggested pony-tailed Lt. Col. Idan. This served as a reminder both that the unit hadn’t taken such steps in two battle arenas since the 1973 Yom Kippur War and as a prophetic joke. 'We all laughed' he recalls. 'We had no clue the Assad regime would fall the following week and that we’d have to also deal with Soviet tanks and anti-tank missiles in the ‘Pita’ outposts on the Syrian Golan Heights.' Since the outbreak of the war, the Technological and Logistics Directorate’s Enemy Assets Confiscation Unit has accumulated 180,000 pieces of weaponry from the Gaza Strip, southern Lebanon, and Syria - enough for a small army. 'At the beginning, we carried the guns crates and rockets of ammunition that we found there into Israel on our backs at nighttime. We soon realized it was too much.' What’s the booty? Aside from the cash, gold bars and jewelry worth millions of shekels, a variety of anti-tank missiles, drones, cutting-edge rockets for all ranges, thousands of explosive devices of various weights, thousands of rifles - including brand new ones, sniper rifles, military walkie talkies, compasses, binoculars and night vision equipment, shoes and uniforms, dozens of vehicles, and even collectables such as 1930’s French guns and valuable, rare pistols for the use of the better connected Hezbollah terrorists. Indiana Jones meets Maroun El Ras. We’re talking tons of equipment now scattered across the country in warehouses and reinforced bunkers, some secret, waiting to be told what Israel is going to do with all of this military treasure. Northern assets Major A. of the Egoz unit was among the first soldiers dispatched to Lebanon early 2024 as part of the Northern Command’s covert operations in southern Lebanon. A. is sharp, tough, experienced and his body’s dimensions are not especially small. He set out with a group of soldiers fresh out of intensive fighting with Hamas in Gaza’s Khan Younis. At the time, Israeli eyes were on the southern arena. Should we go into Rafah or not? Should we go for a second hostage deal or wait? However, the eyes of A. and his commando brigade comrades, were already on another front. A. and his comrades were dispatched on dozens of covert operations in southern Lebanon’s Redwan-land to locate weapons caches meant for Hezbollah’s elite forces’ invasion of the Galilee, and bring them back to Israel without being detected. They familiarized themselves with the territory and prepared it for the noisy, broad-scale ground operation then launched late September by other IDF brigades. 'So as not to expose operations in southern Lebanon, we couldn’t set up a collection point for enemy weapons like the ones we’d deployed across junctions and roads adjacent to the Gaza border.' 'We couldn’t use vehicles as we were passing right by terrorists in the Shiite villages. It could expose us,' he recalls. 'At the beginning, we carried the guns crates and rockets of ammunition that we found there into Israel on our backs at nighttime. We soon realized it was too much. It was breaking our backs – and our men are strong.' The vast quantity of spoils of war found by the soldiers came up for debate among Northern Command top brass, who realized that there were huge weapons caches located right in front Metula and Misgav HaAmakim kindergarten areas and Shlomi and Kiryat Shmona homes and neighborhoods. An officer who was in the know says, 'In the end, they were authorized to remotely destroy half of the weapons and bring the rest to Israel, which was very difficult. So as not to expose operations in southern Lebanon, we couldn’t set up a collection point for enemy weapons like the ones we’d deployed across junctions and roads adjacent to the Gaza border.' The dilemma reached the Northern Command chief and the Chief of Staff, and it was decided that the seized weapons would be brought into Israel only if it didn’t endanger troops. As their friends form the unit greeted the soldiers on their return, they were astonished by the quality of the weapons. 'There was no need to clean or refurbish them or test their safety, like we’d done with some of the guns and weapons coming out of Gaza,' says a unit official. 'The weapons seized from Lebanon, were brand new, still in their original packaging, complete with inventory lists that could teach our maintenance and supplies officers a thing or two.' Ethical dilemmas Until 1973, the enemy weapons units were dispersed across IDF divisions. As part of the lessons learned from the Yom Kippur War, they were consolidated into a single General Staff emergency body, made up completely of reservists. The General Staff’s orders regarding seized weapons have been updated in times of war, most recently July-August 2014 during Operation Protective Edge. At the end of that summer, it was decided to break up the unit into northern and southern branches, and a central base at Tzrifin base near Rishon LeZion. At the Julis base, for example, mostly ex-Yahalom personnel deal with weapons likely to detonate, including anti-tank missiles and explosive devices. Over 2,400 soldiers serve in the unit – and it’s not enough. To streamline the process while still in enemy territory, the IDF is now making efforts to recruit 'enemy weapons matchmakers' into the units and battalions. Personnel with specialist 'collectors' tendencies, work to a set methodology: They remove the booty from the brigade that brought it in from enemy territory; conduct preliminary cataloging; register it; disarm explosives and distribute it to the booty storage warehouses. From here, the two main objectives are: intelligence research for ongoing operational activity and understanding the enemy’s weapons, and storage for future that may involve selling or transferring it to another country or recycling for IDF use. 'We firstly register the loot from the combat unit, then it’s all collated in a daily spoils of war report. This also prevents looting.' In recent months, voices from the political echelon have been calling to transfer the seized weapons in the form of aid to Ukraine for its war against Russia. This idea, however, is off the table due to the desire to maintain neutrality regarding the war in Ukraine, certainly toward Putin’s Russia with its interests in Syria, the quantities not serious enough for the scale of fighting in Ukraine anyhow: Seized weapons from Israel would be a drop in the ocean for Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s vast forces, already supported by Germany and, until now, the US. The IDF is also not confirming whether it has managed to recycle any of the explosive materials for the use of IDF’s engineering forces. However, Ynet has learned that this is, at least, in its pilot stages, if only to ease IDF’s enormous demand for explosive devices. 'We’re rushing to optimize the seized weapons for our soldiers,' says Lt. Col. Sharon-Kettler. 'Immediately following Hamas’s invasion of the Western Negev October 7, we studied the adhesive charges they had developed for armored vehicles. This is how we assured the protected of the Namer armored personnel carriers in the two and half weeks between the massacre and the start of the ground operation.' As far as we know, there have only been a small number of cases of weapons stolen by IDF soldiers - none of whom were from the retrieval unit. These cases, which included the theft of Kalashnikovs from Gaza and one case of a stolen Hezbollah jeep, are treated as criminal. Concerned this could spread, the IDF has deployed military police to check the trunks of all vehicles leaving bases storing enemy weapons, to make sure no one’s taking home any souvenirs. 'Everything is documented and counted,' explains Lt. Col. Sharon-Kettler. 'We firstly register the loot from the combat unit, then it’s all collated in a daily spoils of war report. This also prevents looting.' What to do with the tanks The enemy weapons unit recently reached a historic milestone: for the first time since the Yom Kippur War, its personnel collected weapons from a regular, state military force. Even in Lt. Col. Sharon-Kettler’s wildest dreams, he likely couldn’t have imagined such a mission a year ago. What started out as half-joke, half-wishful thinking, became real in recent weeks: IDF enemy weapons personnel found themselves in Syrian territory, loading two old Soviet T-55 tanks - after collecting thousands of pieces of weaponry from Assad’s crumbling army, including anti-tank missiles, large explosive warheads, Kalashnikovs and plenty of ammunition – all manufactured in the Eastern Bloc. In one Syrian outpost, they even found an old Nazi-era German gun. 'In one tank, we actually found relatively new systems, with an anti-tank missile system that fired from inside the tank itself, which seemed to have undergone maintenance and had been upgraded in recent years. They were operational,' says Lt. Col. Idan. 'Gathering weapons from the enemy without having to fight them was rather surrealistic for us. We just walked into their bases and loaded up.' The amazement was also shared by the Syrian civilians. With an armored vehicle, the IDF soldiers dragged the two-tank booty in the dead of night through open terrain, until reaching a road near Quneitra. Curious local photographers were waiting to film the tanks crossing the border into Israel en route to their new home at an IDF base on the Golan Heights. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The shells and the ammo rack in the belly of the tank where they were stored were heavily greased – something we don’t do under our protocol. What loader would pick up a shell that would slip straight out of his hands?' says Lt. Col. Idan, referring to what he found as he entered the Soviet tank. 'This was probably their way of preventing the shells from getting stuck in all the accumulated rust.' 'Capturing war trophies such as tanks without enemy bodies in them like in the past was very strange. The unit was accompanied by rabbinate personnel. Gathering weapons from the enemy without having to fight them was rather surrealistic for us. We just walked into their bases and loaded up.' The IDF is now mulling what to do with the two Syrian tanks. Should they break them down for scrap or put them in a museum? A less romantic option is using them for shooting practice for armored corps training at the Shizafon army base. Captured medical equipment The military-legal definition of 'booty' is any property or item found in possession of a terrorist organization or enemy state, found during wartime or during hostilities against Israel. This may, at first glance, seem like a clear and simple definition. On the ground, however, there are plenty of dilemmas that end up with leaving behind terrorists’ property such as cars or money or, conversely, taking medical equipment if it could be used for hostile terrorist activities - such as medical training mannequin found by IDF soldiers at the start of the Gaza ground operation. This mannequin was found in a hostage cage, designed for Hamas terrorists to practice medical treatment on Israeli hostages, babies or children. Horrific as it may sound, this mannequin was taken as booty for completely different purposes - to serve as a Hasbarah tool for Israel in the battle for international legitimacy. Another dilemma faced by the unit and its legal advisors during the ground operation arose while the IDF was preparing to attack a hospital being used as the Nukhba terrorists’ main headquarters. Troops found a rather new and very expensive MRI machine inside the hospital, the kind that even Israel's healthcare system desperately needed, especially in the periphery. 'We debated whether to send in troops to remove it. After extensive consultations, we decided against it, as we couldn’t prove that this device served terrorist purposes,' says a unit official. 'We thought of maybe removing the machine before the attack, and then returning it to the Gazans, but we then realized they might sue us if the machine was damaged.' In the end, the hospital used as a terrorist base was attacked, with the MRI machine inside.' Another dilemma regarding seized equipment involved a unit commander fighting in Gaza noticing spare parts belonging to Palestinian forces, and realizing they could be used for his own unit's tanks and vehicles. 'He contacted us, sent photos from the field, and explained that these parts might be critically needed for his unit,' the official added. The most fascinating section in the booty base at Tzrifin is that of the 'money suitcases' – piles of cash found in enemy territory, seized and confiscated by IDF soldiers. There was NIS 4 million, found in the private home of a Hamas brigade commander that reached the booty unit and was brought to Israel. There are grey areas here too: The IDF official explains, 'If soldiers go into the home of a terrorist in Gaza and see a 200 shekel note on the table, they can’t take it. It doesn’t count as booty as we have no way of knowing it wasn’t meant for his wife and children.' The seized money is counted in banking machines purchased by the IDF, and the gold and jewelry captured in Gaza and Lebanon are weighed on scales to be valued. This weighing and counting is conducted in the presence of two officers. A special document is then printed off and the valuables are transported in armored vehicles to the Defense Ministry’s main treasury department at the Kirya in Tel Aviv where the money is counted once again and deposited at the Bank of Israel for confiscation purposes. To date, no less than NIS 100 million in various currencies – shekels, dollars, euros and currencies of Arab states - have been confiscated. At this time, only Shayetet soldiers use Kalashnikovs, which are more resistant to water, and it’s yet to be decided whether to give them the best quality guns seized in Lebanon. 'We don’t like integrating just any seized weapons, holding on to them and maintaining them with no benefit,' says Sharon-Kettler. 'I always ask what is the value of this booty? We’re not going to equip a whole Golani battalion with new Kalashnikovs. We also don’t have maintenance for North Korean, Chinese or Russian anti-tank missiles that we’ve captured.' But take a look at all these gleaming, neatly packed, 50 caliber bullets for heavy machine guns. There are also 7.62mm rounds that fit IDF MAG machine guns 'True. We even found Hezbollah ammunition manufactured in 2020. Brand new. We captured so many bullets that we counted them by crate and weight, rather than one by one. We’ll soon change that to get a more accurate count of how many tens, or hundreds, of thousands of bullets we’ve seized. We won’t be using the grenades we seized since most are Eastern-Bloc manufactured with unsafe detonation mechanisms.' Al Capone's rifle A secondary purpose for capturing enemy weapons is for military deception operations. The IDF has turned the battlefield into a war of ruses, setting Hezbollah and Hamas traps and baits, often luring terrorists into its ambushes. The booty unit includes several veteran soldiers, some in their seventies, who say, 'The quantities we reached surpassed past wars. Hamas and Hezbollah aren’t classified as terrorist armies for nothing. For perspective, you must understand: in the Yom Kippur War, we captured 2,000 armored vehicles from Egypt and Syria, only 300 of which we managed to refurbish for IDF use. In Operation Protective Edge, we seized only a few thousand items. In the Second Lebanon War, it wasn’t even a priority.' As my visit to the unit draws to an end, Lt, Col. Sharon-Kettler insists on showing me his guilty pleasure of items cherished by gun collectors. From a dark, cluttered container, he pulls out an Ingram submachine gun, likely an American model copied by Iran or China, with a drum magazine reminiscent of old gangster movies featuring Al Capone or Bonnie and Clyde. 'But take a look at this,' he says proudly, revealing an even rarer find salvaged from Gaza’s alleyways and Lebanon’s bunkers. 'A French MAS-36, a bolt-action rifle seized in Lebanon, and it appears functional. And here’s a Russian PPSh submachine gun, the Soviet equivalent of the American Thompson 'Tommy Gun' from old war films.' The first thought that comes to mind is that these weapons should be preserved as historical mementos - as battalion and brigade commanders have done in the past, framing them in their offices after military operations. The IDF, however has a rigorous protocol for seized weapons. Brig. Gen. Israel Shomer, former commander of the 146th division, now head of operations at the General Staff, took the Kalashnikov rifle of a terrorist who was killed outside his home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7. When he got to his division’s base in the Galilee, he handed the rifle over to a logistics officer to apply for permission to keep it as a memento. IDF approval, however demands that two conditions be met: a direct connection between the captured weapon and the officer (i.e., if the weapon was used in an attack against the officer) and; a recommendation from the Chief of Staff general, who must personally approve it. Brig. Gen. Shomer is still awaiting approval for his Kalashnikov from October 7 which, for now, is securely stored in the IDF's seized weapons warehouses. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bjrt11oshje	2025-03-17T04:16:27-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/HkBXA11GqJg/HkBXA11GqJg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Smotrich: Replacing Shin Bet head 'necessary and justified step'	Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich addressed on Monday the dismissal of Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar in a statement from the Knesset, saying that 'replacing the head of the Shin Bet is a necessary and justified step. Bar should have taken real responsibility and resigned on his own initiative more than a year ago.' According to Smotrich, 'Any violent and coercive attempt by legal officials to strip the government of its legally granted authority to dismiss or appoint the head of the Shin Bet is illegitimate, unlawful, and undemocratic—and it must not be obeyed. I want to strengthen the prime minister and call on him not to surrender to threats and violence, whether from legal officials or from irresponsible opposition and protest elements who have forgotten what it means to be democratic.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1cow5hhje	2025-03-17T04:15:01-07:00	
UNRWA chief confident he is on 'right side of history'	Philippe Lazzarini confronts funding shortages, Israeli sanctions and accusations of Hamas ties, warning that the agency’s collapse would devastate education and healthcare for Gaza UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini acknowledges that it has been 'stressful' leading the embattled UN agency for Palestinian refugees, but says he is confident he is 'on the right side of history'. The 61-year-old head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees has, along with his organization, withstood a barrage of criticism and accusations from Israel since Hamas's deadly October 7, 2023 attack inside Israel and the devastating war in Gaza that followed. 'Of course it is stressful. No one could really be prepared for something like this,' Lazzarini said in a recent interview. It has been rough from the start. The softly-spoken Swiss father of four began his tenure in 2020 under COVID lockdown, as UNRWA was reeling after the United States, traditionally its largest donor, dramatically slashed its contribution during President Donald Trump's first term. But that was nothing compared to what was to come. 'October 7 basically ... destroyed the last protection dikes that UNRWA might have had,' he said, lamenting the 'arsenal' it unleashed 'to try to discredit the agency, attack the agency, get rid of the agency'. Relations between Israel and UNRWA, which supports nearly six million Palestinian refugees across Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, have long been strained, but they have fallen off a cliff in the past year and a half. Israel's allegation that some UNRWA staff took part in the October 7 massacre spurred a string of nations early last year to at least temporarily halt their backing for the already cash-strapped agency. Lazzarini warned of 'the real risk of the agency collapsing and imploding'. Serving as the 'backbone' of the aid operation in Gaza, UNRWA should have funding until June, he said. 'I have no visibility' beyond that, added Lazzarini, speaking on the sidelines of the FIFDH human rights film festival in Geneva where a film about UNRWA was featured. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Funding gaps are not the only problem the agency faces. Amid accusations that UNRWA was 'infested with Hamas terror activity', Israel in January took the unprecedented step of severing ties with the UN agency and banning it from operating on Israeli soil. While UNRWA can still operate in Gaza and the West Bank, it has been barred from contact with Israeli officials, making it difficult to coordinate the safe delivery of aid in the Palestinian territories. No aid is meanwhile going into Gaza, since Israel halted deliveries to the Strip amid a deadlock over a fragile cease-fire. 'This decision threatens the life and survival of civilians in Gaza,' Lazzarini warned. He also described the situation in the West Bank, where Israel has for weeks been carrying out a major counter-terrorism offensive, as 'deeply, deeply troubling'. While uncertain how things would evolve, he said the threat of the Israeli annexation of the West Bank was hanging like 'a Damocles sword over the head of the Palestinians (and) the international community'. Israel has said that UNRWA could be replaced by other UN agencies or NGOs. But Lazzarini argued that while other organizations could handle distributing humanitarian aid, they could not replace UNRWA's delivery of 'government-like services' such as education and healthcare. Without UNRWA, 'we would definitely sacrifice a generation of kids, who would be deprived of proper education', he warned. Education should also be a top priority for Israel, he insisted. 'If you deprive 100,000 girls and boys in Gaza (of an) education, and if they have no future, and if their school is just despair and living in the rubble, I would say we are just sowing the seeds for more extremism.' Israel has for years accused UNRWA schools of teaching antisemitism and the hatred of Israel. Lazzarini decried 'an extraordinary war of disinformation' against the agency. Lazzarini, who himself has been the target of virulent attacks, acknowledged that 'certainly I don't read everything and don't listen to everything. Otherwise, you wouldn't sleep anymore.' He added: 'If I didn't feel that I am still on the right side of history, I don't think I would continue to carry on.' But, he said, 'I have been given a voice, and obviously I need to use this voice. That is the minimum we owe to the Palestinian refugees who are pretty voiceless.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjvidfbnyx	2025-03-17T04:10:04-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/06/24/SyKp00kP8C/SyKp00kP8C_897_746_2104_1183_0_small.jpg

‘Can you guarantee it won't happen again?’ IDF’s October 7 invest...	Military's investigations into failures leading into and during Hamas’ attack leave out critical intelligence failures, with residents skeptical and demanding an external review to address systemic shortcomings Residents of the Gaza border communities remain uncertain about returning home, even after the IDF presented its findings from investigations into the failures leading up to and on October 7. 'You've shown us the mistakes, the malfunctions and the findings. But what’s next? How can you guarantee October 7 won't happen again?' they asked. No senior officer, past or present, had an answer. One officer admitted the truth: only a high-level inquiry, like a state commission, could provide real answers and help Israel understand how the massacre on October 7 could take place — and, more importantly, how to prevent another invasion. Significant gaps remain in the investigations focused solely on the military’s performance. Some agencies, including the Magen David Adom emergency medical service, the Israel Police and even the Shin Bet did not cooperate with the military’s probes. Each had its own reasons, despite thousands of medics, officers and security personnel having worked closely with the IDF. Investigators also faced overwhelming workloads. The probe into Kibbutz Nir Oz initially involved a senior artillery corps officer but later required retired Maj. Gen. Eran Niv to step in due to the scale of the failures. Many investigation team leaders were active-duty commanders juggling frontline combat in Gaza and Lebanon alongside their probe duties. One officer, Col. A., who commands a reserve brigade under the 98th Division, earned the nickname 'Nahal Oz Brigade Commander' from his troops because of his repeated visits to the overrun base where 53 soldiers were killed. IDF leadership was also uneasy that many of those questioned — from brigade commanders to senior generals — consulted lawyers provided by the military before responding to investigators. 'It was clear who sought legal advice and who didn't,' a military source said. External review team appointed A year after he rejected the idea, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved former IDF chief Herzi Halevi’s request to appoint an external review team to reassess the military’s investigations, issue recommendations for command (mostly symbolic, as some officers involved have already retired) and oversee implementation of lessons learned. Led by former IDF Southern Command chief Sami Turgeman, the team includes retired generals who will examine concerns over investigator bias. For instance, the Southern Command's inquiry was led by Brig. Gen. (res.) Tal Hermoni, who was part of the command on October 7 and is still serving there. During the attack, he was the command’s home front officer working alongside his superior, Southern Command chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, in the main war room in Be’er Sheva, giving orders. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In another case, an investigator was a brigade commander who had fought in the very battle he was assigned to review. While no one questioned their integrity, their inquiries were inherently limited — military leadership instructed them not to assign personal measures such as dismissals or reprimands. The only investigator to defy this order was Col. A., who reviewed the battle at the Nahal Oz base. Given the extent of the failures, the culture of negligence and the blatant disregard for operational orders he uncovered, he refused to avoid personal accountability. Sensitive findings withheld The investigations released to the public so far — including the next one, set to be shared with families and survivors of the Nova music festival — have omitted key aspects and completed reports, such as those concerning the IDF’s Gaza Division and intelligence units like Unit 8200. The military has reasons for this: these reports contain severe allegations from mid-level officers about critical failures, ignored warnings and a culture of complacency. Golani Brigade commanders, for example, were deeply frustrated with Southern Command leaders, who failed to provide them with grenades or adequate combat gear in advance and withheld intelligence known on the night of the attack. Golani units were manning the frontline that Saturday. Other forces present that weekend for training were furious to learn that no one in the operations division, led by Brig. Gen. Shlomi Binder knew they were available, armed and ready to deploy. 'We lost one to two crucial hours — hundreds of troops could have reached the Gaza border by 9:00 a.m. instead of 11:00 a.m.,' one internal report noted. At the war’s outset, a senior military official warned that conducting investigations mid-fighting would weaken the army by fueling blame games. He likely didn’t anticipate the war dragging on indefinitely. The way the military chose to investigate itself — and the limited, filtered manner in which findings have been presented — reveals how deeply that fear influenced the process. Some within the military argue that the investigations paint such contradictory narratives that it’s hard to believe that the same officers were involved in the same events. In the Gaza Division, for instance, Brig. Gen. Avi Rosenfeld, who commanded it on October 7, still insists the division didn’t collapse. 'The war room’s lights may have been out for 10 minutes, but the real failure was intelligence, not our response,' he claimed. The IDF maintains that 'many lessons learned have already been implemented, including larger forces and readiness changes. As for the investigators, due to the volume of inquiries — over 50 — some were led by active-duty officers rather than reservists. 'To restore public trust, we worked to complete and present the findings. We chose not to issue personal recommendations to ensure interviewees spoke freely, focusing on improvement rather than blame.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj00qxih2jg	2025-03-17T02:24:04-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/15/yk14296174/yk14296174_0_58_944_532_0_small.jpg
IDF clears 120km along Lebanon border to block Hezbollah infiltra...	New initiative reshapes the border, clearing forests and destroying terror group's infrastructure to secure northern communities; Israel vows to maintain a buffer zone through surveillance and engineering to prevent future threats This covert plan, codenamed 'Silver Plow,' was conceived in the initial days following October 7. The IDF Northern Command had completed its reservist call-up in a matter of days, and tens of thousands of soldiers had reported for duty on the Lebanese border in efforts to prevent Hezbollah from joining the Hamas attack. Amid the uncertainty and deliberations within the general staff and security cabinet over whether to first act on the northern front against Hezbollah to thwart the anticipated attack or to focus first on Gaza, an unprecedented engineering operation was launched. It aimed to reshape the sector and utilize each and every day of fighting to ensure that by the time calm returned, the border would look completely different. As security restrictions on border communities were lifted this week and evacuees returned, the IDF stated that with regard to the borderline, on both the Israeli and Lebanese sides – Mission accomplished. For over a year, in what became one of the IDF’s most complex engineering operations, thousands of engineering and infantry soldiers shaped the new border of diverse terrain along more than 120km stretching from Rosh Hanikra to Har Dov. Hezbollah had spent decades constructing terrorist compounds in buildings, forests and underground infrastructure along the entire border as part of Nasrallah’s plan to conquer the Galilee. Now, the IDF sought to ensure that the entire border zone, including a few dozen kilometers into Lebanese territory, would be cleared and barren. Back to the Second Lebanon War Until the early hours of last Tuesday, when the IDF completed its withdrawal from south Lebanon (with the exception of five strategic points within Lebanese territory), IDF engineering personnel were still pulling up trees and clearing the thicket overlooking Israel’s northern communities. 'We divided up the border into sections and broke down each sector based on its topography and the type of engineering work it required,' says Northern Command Chief Engineering Officer, Col. I. Back in 2006, as a young officer, he had fought in the Second Lebanon War. When he withdrew with the troops after 36 days of fighting, he felt a sense of frustration knowing the task had not been completed. This time around, he means to finish the job. 'Back in October 2023, when the war kicked off, we brought in geologists, engineers and earthworks experts to provide solutions for the forests, wadis, buildings and underground infrastructure we knew we would encounter during the mission,' says Col. I. For almost a year, up to September 2024, the IDF didn’t know whether or not there would be a ground operation into Lebanon or what would come of the engineering efforts to avert a ground incursion. 'Our operational priorities rested on firstly addressing the areas facing civilian communities,' says Col. I. This was to prevent Hezbollah from preparing itself in the dense forested areas so as to infiltrate Israel under the cover of the thicket. Working methodically, engineering forces continued addressing operational weak points such as wadis serving as potential infiltration routes. At some stage, the IDF gave up on waiting for an IDF ground operation into Lebanon. Each night, under the cover of darkness, armored engineering vehicles would work beyond the Blue Line, and were later joined by lighter armored vehicles for covert operations that were conducted with artillery back-up. Since the war started, 300 military and commandeered civilian mechanical engineering equipment vehicles, joined by four engineering battalions - some brought in from other sectors - have been working away along the border, invariably under fire and anti-tank missile attack. And soldiers have been wounded. 'We stretched our engineering capabilities to the limit while, at the same time, supporting the ground operation troops.' The operation’s turning point came as the ground operation into Lebanon kicked off October 2024. 'Once we attained operational control of the sector, we stopped our ‘regular’ work and went in with full force. We drafted hundreds of reservist engineering soldiers and civilian earthworks contractors who joined in demolishing terrorist infrastructure across the entire sector,' says Col. I. Positions made of scraps I meet reservist officer Lt. Col. S. of the 146th division, responsible for the western sector from Rosh Hanikra to Shtula, by Kibbutz Hanita’s perimeter fence. 'You should have seen what the wadi here looked like a year back,' he says pointing at the wadi across the border. 'It was one hell of a forest and we were working at crazy inclines to remove all the thicket to ensure no one could infiltrate without us spotting them.' Engineering troops cleared 200 meters to a kilometer from the border. 'Take Maroun El Ras, overlooking Avivim: We completely cleared the buildings at the highest spots and took down anything capable of firing at the community. We obviously cleared the whole extensive underground infrastructure that we found in the village an on its slopes.' The 146th battalion’s engineering personnel cleared a sum total of 9.5 km of tough terrain. 'We stretched our engineering capabilities to the limit while, at the same time, supporting the ground operation troops, providing them with engineering jobs deep inside Lebanon,' says Lt. Col. S. 'We gave all we could including handheld electric saws in spots the D9s couldn’t reach and machetes to clear paths for the excavators.' Without taking his eyes off the striking wadi, bare of trees and heavy bushes, he says, 'When we found underground bunkers, command centers, rooms for terrorists, observation and firing positions etc., it was a fortified thicket. Now, looking at this area, you can see that the enemy can’t position itself or hide there anymore.' Lt. Col. S. describes the terrorist infrastructure Hezbollah had prepared for its incursion into Israel which Israeli soldiers found in the summer of 2006 beneath the primitive 'nature reserves'. 'Here, we saw how Hezbollah was preparing to reach the border fence. You’re walking along, and suddenly you feel something unsteady. You clear the undergrowth, pick up a net, and underneath there’s a wooden panel, and inside there’s a dug-out outpost with complete combat equipment inside a barrel. Under the cover of darkness or fog, all the Redwan forces had to do was take the barrel out, get dressed, pull out the iron frame hidden nearby in the ground, attach the explosive devices, attach that to the wall or fence, and detonate it. They would then charge ahead with hundreds more militants awaiting orders. Unhindered by UN 'peacekeeping' forces, Hezbollah operatives also dug terrorist infrastructure next to UNIFIL outposts. 'When we found underground bunkers, command centers, rooms for terrorists, observation and firing positions etc., it was a fortified thicket.' Each evening, Lt. Col. S. and his personnel would sit down to approve the following day’s sabotage operations. Their need for landmines and explosive materials was met with limited allocations due to immense operational needs in both the north and south. They came up with creative solutions. It may mean driving to the southern part of the Golan Heights and, cautiously, gathering live anti-tank mines, loading them onto trucks and taking them directly to Hezbollah tunnels and infrastructure. 'The minimum we needed to blow up the infrastructure was eight tons and we only had four. We would do everything to ensure we had eight tons,' he says with a smile. Lt. Col. S. was among the first soldiers to go into the tunnel dug near Moshav Zarit, the only cross-border tunnel structure the IDF found in the north during the war. This tunnel was not yet completed or operational. For months, however, intelligence units and infantry troops had been, 'holding,' it, waiting for the order to clear and destroy it. 'So that Hezbollah couldn’t remain there, before approaching the tunnels and underground installations, for which we had extensive intelligence, we destroyed nearby generators, solar panels, ventilation systems and cameras Hezbollah had installed for observation and surveillance purposes. Lt. Col. S. lives on Kibbutz Dafna in the Upper Galilee and his family was evacuated October 2023. Wouldn’t he have rather taken responsibility for the eastern sector to simply protect his own home? S. replies, 'I want to create security for the residents here, just like I expect the 91st division engineering officer to do in his sector.' He bursts out laughing and says, 'Don’t worry. The neighboring sector’s engineering officer Lt. Col. G. lives here with his family in the Western Galilee and we each make sure the other’s area is safer.' Most of the contractors and professionals, alongside the army commanders who played a role in the clearing operation, live in the north. Cutting down the shrubs Last week, a few days before the withdrawal from southern Lebanon was completed, I went to examine the clearing operation’s results on the other side of the fence. At the Fatima Gate between Israel and Lebanon on the outskirts of Metula, I met the 91st Division’s red-haired engineering officer Lt. Col. G. We set out together, driving through the Kfar Kila and Al-Aadaissah which I had visited several times over the past year. They looked totally different each time. 'Remember how Hezbollah operatives would be standing on the Hammamis Ridge and would irritate the people of Metula with lasers? You can’t get there by vehicle anymore and anyone trying get there on foot to provoke or harm us - we’ll get to him and take him out,' he promises. Driving along, we pass huge engineering vehicles that had carved into the rock, crushed roads and houses and flattened lookout platforms used by Hezbollah to overlook Metula and its surrounding and harass farmers tending the nearby orchards. 'By Tuesday, this road we’re driving along won’t be here anymore. We’ll ensure there’s no Lebanese movement here and that the sector’s sterile,' says Lt. Col. G. 'Everything preventing the IDF from defending the communities along the border, everywhere I’ve been wanting to get to and address for years, has been obliterated in the past year.' We pass by the spectacular, 'Palace of Arches,' which once overlooked Metula, Misgav Am and the Hula Valley. For years, I had seen it from the Israeli side, and now I find myself at the foot of its ruins. The 91st division’s 'Barimo Team,' headed by 67-year-old Col. (res.) Avi Cohen (Barimo), is pushing aside the rubble with excavators so as to deepen the buffer zone. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Along the wall surrounding Metula, engineering vehicles are dragging massive piles of barbed wire, laying it into the ground, as yet one more brick to reinforce the sector’s defense. At our next stop, on the Lebanese ridge overlooking Kibbutz Misgav Am and above the Lebanese village of Al-Aadaissah, just meters from the border fence, we set out walking through steep valley following the sound of a mechanical saw. We walk very carefully, not just because the slopes are steep, but also to avoid tripping over communication cables Hezbollah had laid between their dug-in combat positions, which are very hard to spot. The reservist 'Dvorah' commando unit, made up of Galilee residents, was set up to provide immediate response to any Redwan Force incursion, is clearing the thicket deeper into Lebanon using handheld gas-powered saws and cutting down the most obstinate trees. As part of their work, they have found shafts for accommodation, firing and observation positions, and even explosive devices and a rocket launcher aimed at Misgav Am. 'On October 7, we were up there on the mountain, waiting for the Redwan Force,' says Maj. I. pointing at the kibbutz overlooking us. 'For months, Hezbollah operatives were wondering around here feely launching Burkan rockets and missiles. In the village below us, the Egoz reconnaissance unit was engaged in a fierce battle.' Dvorah soldiers, all locals, mostly from evacuated communities, nicknamed this manual engineering operation, 'Excessive Pruning'. 'It’s very tough work, but we know how important it is. This sector can’t go back to being a combat zone,' say Major I. He intends returning home with his family next week and is sure it's now safe here: 'The situation now is the best it’s ever been. The most important question is how we keep it this way. The work done here is very impressive, and we have to ensure there’s a real buffer zone here so that Hezbollah never returns.' Last week however, to the dismay of northern residents, Hezbollah operatives returned to what were their homes, and Lebanese engineering vehicles immediately started clearing the rubble so as to rebuild them. Hezbollah flags, are once again visible among the ruins, and Lebanese civilians are try approaching the fence on a daily basis. Municipality leaders have called out the government for not insisting that the enemy will never return. Meanwhile, without officially declaring it, the IDF is partially implementing demands of border-adjacent communities to create a security (perimeter) zone in which the enemy cannot move. This rather narrow strip does not meet the expectation that all the front-line village remain in ruins as a political price Israel should exact for its long-term security. The IDF, however, is committed to stopping or killing any enemy trying to approach the fence by means of various security mechanisms positioned along the 120-kilometer border. 'At the end of the day, the clearing operation is yet one more, highly significant, step meant to provide the residents with tangible and visible security,' says Lt. Col. G. 'IDF troops are positioned in front of, rather than behind, the communities and we’re building layer upon layer so that residents of Metula can return to sleep in their own homes.' 'I know the breakdown of trust with the civilians here is complex and replete with fears and concerns,' says Lt. Col. G. 'I believe we can bridge this, not by declarations about restoring a ‘sense of security’ but rather, by action demonstrating the security we’ve established here. 'Everything preventing the IDF from defending the communities along the border, everywhere I’ve been wanting to get to and address for years, has been obliterated in the past year. This new security zone means we can improve our control and lethal mobility capabilities in the area. This is in addition to five new outposts set up at strategic security points along the border.' Only the beginning That said, IDF officials are well aware that actions taken along the border are not enough to restore trust. This will rather depend on how they act from now on to sustain achievements both along the border sector, and beyond, deeper into Lebanon. 'I hope that our message about red lines has also been received on the other side. It would be unwise for them to rebuild their homes on the wall because they’ll be destroyed,' said a defense official this week. Northern Command engineering forces will now also be tasked with ensuring that clearing operation’s achievements are maintained at all costs. The army will have to avert 'afforestation' efforts in the area, with the understanding no ecological intentions lie being planting anything along the border. 'We will have to maintain and preserve the new defense line we’ve cleared east to west, ensuring nothing grows or is built on this ground. As far as we’re concerned, this is a kill zone,' say Northern Command officials. As residents are called to return home and restore their lives and businesses destroyed by Hezbollah fire, Lt. Col. G. talks of a 'new contract' between the military and the civilian population. 'A woman from Metula needs to know she can sit safely on the balcony in her home, and see everything the army has done and ‘cleansed’ in the terrorists’ villages across the border. 'I believe that, after the war, our response to any efforts at harming civilian security will be stronger. Residents will have to support us so that we’ll be able to prevent and attack any rehabilitation efforts on the other side. We’ll have to respond with harder blows, even when tested with so much as a tickle. We did this under incessant fire. I’m sure we can do it during routine security operations.' Married father of three small children Lt. Col. G. lives in a Druze village near Carmiel he’s hardly been home since the start of the war. He’s one of 12 siblings. Four of his six brothers are engineering soldiers like himself, and two are serving in the security forces. His grandfather was killed in action in 1967, for which he was awarded a Medal of Distinguished Service. His father spent his life serving in the police and died of a heart attack. His younger brother G., a reservist officer, was killed by an anti-tank missile during a battle in Rafah six months ago. Of his late brother, Lt. Col. G. sadly says, 'My brother was very happy to be taking part in the war defending the state. He'd always say, ‘If we don’t do it, no one will do it for us.' Immediately following the three days mourning for his brother, he returned to southern Lebanon to command the sector’s engineering efforts. Lt. Col. G. was wounded himself a few months later by a tunnel collapsing. After surgery on his arm, and with metal plates and screws in his arm, he wasn’t waiting for full recovery, but rather got back into the field and to the task of restoring security to the residents of the north. 'The blood of thousands of soldiers who fell here and in the south wasn’t spilled in vain,' says Lt. Col. G. We won’t stop for as long as we’re needed here. I won’t be going anywhere, whatever price we pay at home. If we achieve calm for our children, and in 20 years’ time, they won’t have to fight anymore, it will have been worth the price.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1izzdr3yx	2025-03-17T01:59:57-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/yk14276282/yk14276282_0_207_2248_1265_0_small.jpg

At least 10 dead in escalating Syria-Lebanon border clashes	Damascus accuses Hezbollah members of crossing border on Saturday, kidnapping three soldiers and killing them on Lebanese soil Fighting erupted along the border between Lebanon and Syria overnight into Monday, Syrian state media reported, after three Syrian soldiers were killed in earlier clashes. A military source told Qatar-based Al Jazeera that eight soldiers and two Syrian civilians were killed in Hezbollah strikes in the Homs region of Syria. The violence came a month after days-long fighting between the Syrian military and armed Lebanese Shia groups closely allied with the ousted Bashar Assad government in Syria’s Al-Qasr area. Lebanon has been seeking international support to boost funding for its military as it gradually deploys troops along its porous northern and eastern borders with Syria and along its southern border with Israel. The Lebanese and Syrian armies said they are communicating with each other to ease tensions. Lebanese troops have been deployed in large numbers in the area. Families in the border areas fled toward Hermel in Syria amid the overnight clashes and shelling. > Syria’s interim government accused terrorists from the Lebanese Hezbollah group of crossing northeastern Lebanon into Syria on Saturday, kidnapping three soldiers and killing them on Lebanese soil. Hezbollah in a statement denied any involvement. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said the Shia groups were involved. The circumstances of the incident remain unclear. Syrian state media, citing an unnamed Defense Ministry official, said the Syrian army shelled 'Hezbollah gatherings that killed the Syrian soldiers' along the border. Though the clashes largely calmed before sunrise, Lebanese media reported low-level fighting at dawn after an attack on a Syrian military vehicle. The Lebanese military said it delivered the bodies of the three killed soldiers to their Syrian counterparts. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjnt7wh31l	2025-03-17T01:07:06-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/SyZGwPDjkg/SyZGwPDjkg_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Shmulik Moskowitz, co-founder of Nechama and Hatzala: 'The sweetness, like the chocolate, brings out a smile for a day' This year, like last year, many families spent Purim with their loved ones on the frontlines—fathers, sons, and daughters. One organization, Nechama and Hatzala, took it upon themselves to bring some of these soldiers something sweet for the holiday, hoping to put a smile on their faces. 'We decided to bring a little bit of the feeling from home to the frontlines—even inside Gaza this year,' said Shmulik Moskowitz, co-founder of Nechama and Hatzala. 'The sweetness, like the chocolate, brings out a smile for a day,' Moskowitz added. The soldiers in Gaza often rely on canned food and rarely receive treats to warm their bodies and hearts. The care packages included notes from children thanking them for their service. 'Even if it’s just for 10, 30 minutes, or an hour of smiling and remembering that it’s a holiday… I think it is very important,' said Moskowitz.

Rich Outzen says Trump would be willing to support renewed strikes on Hamas leadership targets When it comes to hostage negotiations, the onus is now on Hamas leadership, according to U.S. Col. (Res.) Rich Outzen of the Atlantic Council. 'I think the goal for Trump is to get the hostages released,' Outzen said. 'I think that Trump will be supportive of renewed pressure focused on Hamas leadership, with the specific goal—not of reoccupying the Gaza Strip or anything like that—but altering the decision calculus.' He said the idea that Hamas would manipulate the lives of the remaining hostages and the bodies of those who are deceased as part of an endgame strategy would anger Trump.

Justice Department targets terror supporters on campus in major f...	Protester Mahmoud Khalil is now detained by ICE and is expected to be deported The Trump administration’s Justice Department is launching a major crackdown on terror supporters at Columbia University after months of pro-Hamas protests that have shocked the nation. This follows the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia student on a green card who orchestrated the protests and allegedly distributed Hamas flyers on campus. Khalil is now detained by ICE and is expected to be deported. Multiple other arrests have also been made involving student activists on foreign visas. The protests saw hundreds of radical students harassing Jewish students and waving terrorist flags during campus demonstrations that openly celebrated Hamas attacks on Israel. Justice Department officials now confirm they are investigating whether these protests violated federal terrorism laws, including possible material support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. A senior Homeland Security official stated: 'Any person or group providing support or promoting foreign terror groups on American soil is subject to federal prosecution—college campus or not.' Critics say this move is long overdue, calling out Columbia University for failing to stop the anti-American extremism festering on its campus, including assaults against Jewish students, pro-Hamas chants, and open support for terror organizations. Now, the White House is signaling that other universities could soon face similar investigations if they allow this kind of behavior to continue. Columbia responded by saying it is cooperating with law enforcement but insists it will protect what it calls 'the right to peaceful protest.' However, critics argue that harassment and terror promotion are not protected speech. The Trump administration—and Republican leaders—are praising the Justice Department’s actions but insist more must be done to hold universities accountable, including cutting all federal funding. Currently, at least 10 universities are under investigation for their refusal to curb antisemitism. As the crackdown begins, the message from Washington is clear: Support for Hamas has consequences—even at Ivy League schools.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryvzh4rhke	2025-03-16T22:11:32-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/13/Sk00hOxeh1x/Sk00hOxeh1x_0_85_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF strikes Radwan Force command center in southern Lebanon after...	In response to the gun fire that hit a car window, residents of Moshav Avivim welded shut their community’s gates, accusing the government of tolerating attacks and endangering their lives Israeli forces struck a Radwan Force command and control center and buildings used by Hezbollah in southern Lebanon on Sunday evening, according to the IDF spokesperson. The strikes followed earlier attacks on targets in the village of Aainata, launched after a bullet fired from Lebanon struck a vehicle windshield in the northern Israeli community of Avivim. The IDF said in a statement that: 'The presence of such terrorist infrastructure constitutes a blatant violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon The IDF will not allow this kind of activity and will act against it. The IDF will strike armed terrorists in southern Lebanon, and will operate in order to remove any threat to the State of Israel.' Later reports from Lebanon indicated an additional airstrike was carried out by an Israeli helicopter in the village of Yaroun. According to Al-Mayadeen, a Hezbollah-affiliated network, this was the third Israeli helicopter strike in Yaroun on Sunday. Following the gunfire incident, residents of Avivim decided to weld shut their community’s gates, accusing the government of tolerating attacks on their village and endangering their lives. The bullet that hit the vehicle earlier in the afternoon narrowly missed the driver, who was inside at the time but was unharmed. The incident took place near the Avivim Winery, which was destroyed by a direct hit from an anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon about a year ago. In response, the IDF launched strikes on targets in Aainata. Initial assessments indicated that several bullets were fired toward the vehicle and the area. Defense Minister Israel Katz instructed the IDF to respond and issued a warning to the Lebanese government. 'The claim that it was a stray bullet fired during the funeral of a Hezbollah operative in a nearby village is completely unacceptable,' he said. 'We will not tolerate any attacks on northern residents for any reason and will respond to any violation of the ceasefire. Any threat or harm to the security of northern residents will be met with a firm hand.' > The Upper Galilee Regional Council’s security department notified residents of the incident, stating that:'Shots were fired, hitting a vehicle in Avivim, and additional gunfire was reported near a farmer working close to the border fence. It is believed the shooting occurred during a funeral held in Maroun al-Ras. The incident is under investigation.' Council head Amit Sofer warned: 'The shooting incidents in Avivim, which this time miraculously ended without casualties, are a red flag that cannot be ignored. The risk to lives is real. I don’t understand how anyone can tell Avivim’s residents to return home when there’s no buffer zone to protect them. Now, with Hezbollah operatives back in the villages, it’s a complete Wild West.' Residents of Avivim told Ynet that a person inside the vehicle reported hearing gunfire from light weapons in the area. A bullet struck the windshield, narrowly missing the driver. Military and police forces are currently deployed in the community. 'It’s terrifying — he was almost killed,' one local resident told Ynet. The driver is not a resident of Avivim but was visiting to meet with officials from Israel’s Property Tax Authority. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skfjv04hkx	2025-03-16T15:09:54-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/16/H1gXAjLE3kl/H1gXAjLE3kl_0_117_600_338_0_small.jpg
Released hostage Eli Sharabi to address UN Security Council	Sharabi, whose wife and daughters were killed by Gazan terrorists on October 7, to appear as guest of the U.S. mission and Israel's UN envoy and will recount the horrors he endured as a hostage at the hands of Hamas Released hostage Eli Sharabi will address the United Nations Security Council later this week to share his experiences during the long months in captivity while in the hands of Hamas. He will be the guest of the U.S. delegation to the UN and Israel's envoy Danny Danon. Sharabi was in Washington and met with U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this month when he was invited to the White House along with other former hostages. The president was told about an interview Sharabi gave to Israel's Channel 12, describing the horrors he endured while being held hostage by Hamas. Trump was also shocked by his appearance upon his release, along with Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy. They resembled survivors of the Nazi concentration camps, the president said. 'After everyone in Israel was shocked to hear his account of the time in captivity, I have no doubt that the ambassadors in the Security Council will be unable to continue to turn a blind eye to the reality and refuse to work for our hostages. We will not be silenced until they are all home,' Danon said. > Sharabi was abducted from his home during the Hamas massacre, when he agreed to lay down his arms and go with the terrorists to Gaza to save his wife and two daughters who were sheltering during the attack. Only upon his return did he learn that they were all murdered and one of his brothers who was also abducted, was killed in captivity. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj9qqpe3ye	2025-03-16T14:27:13-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/B11mwjNFkx/B11mwjNFkx_0_188_2360_1328_0_small.jpg

'Long live Pope Francis!' Father Jose Maria 'Pepe' di Paola, a member of a local group of priests in poor neighborhoods, told the congregation. 'This is how we should live the Church as Pope Francis teaches us, a poor church for the poor.' Before he was elected to head the Catholic Church of 1.4 billion believers, 12 years ago, Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, had served as the Archbishop of Buenos Aires where his closeness to the poor earned him a nickname: 'the slum pope.'

Journalist-terrorists in Gaza operated under media cover, partici...	Since the war began, 192 Palestinian journalists have been killed in Gaza — most in targeted strikes on terrorists; Pro-Hamas and Islamic Jihad media accuse Israel of 'war crimes,' ignoring journalists' roles in the Oct. 7 attack, including holding hostages Gaza’s government media office said Saturday that 192 Palestinian journalists have allegedly been killed by Israeli forces since October 7, 2023. The statement came after an Israeli strike killed a group of terrorists in Gaza, including one who entered Israel during the October 7 terror attack, and others who allegedly operated under the guise of media personnel. According to Palestinian officials, the slain individuals were using a drone to 'document the distribution of humanitarian aid' as part of their journalistic work. Hamas' media office later echoed this claim, telling the AFP that the drone was being used to capture footage of an iftar meal during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Hamas officials asserted that the journalists were targeted despite the 'clear nature of their work.' The IDF's Arabic-language spokesperson acknowledged that the dead were also journalists but said they were members of terrorist organizations. The Palestinian Center for the Protection of Journalists condemned the strike, calling it a 'war crime.' > The Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate accused Israel of being responsible for the deaths of 183 journalists in Gaza over the past year — a figure it said is double the number of journalists killed worldwide annually while on the job. Many media outlets in Gaza are linked to Hamas or the Islamic Jihad. Nearly every Palestinian faction operates its own media arm, and journalists working for these outlets may be official supporters of terror groups. Some work directly with the organizations, such as those employed by Al-Quds Radio, which is affiliated with Islamic Jihad, and Hamas' Al-Aqsa TV channel. Others are involved in psychological warfare, public mobilization, and promoting the groups' narratives. Given the security and political conditions in Gaza, Hamas and Islamic Jihad influence journalists throughout the territory, even those not formally affiliated with them. As the ruling authority, Hamas enforces regulations on all media operating in Gaza, including international outlets. Foreign journalists seeking work permits in the region generally avoid criticizing Hamas or addressing sensitive security issues, regardless of their editorial independence. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s155f00421g	2025-03-16T12:03:37-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/01/16/HyXD5cmta/HyXD5cmta_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Police says the smugglers used drones capable of carrying up to 70 kg, and they were found in nearly every home searched in Bir Hadaj suspected of animal smuggling Lion cubs and monkeys were most likely smuggled from Jordan and Egypt using drones, as two additional monkeys were discovered—one in Dabburiya and another in central Ramat Gan, the Israel Police reported Sunday. So far, authorities have found four lion cubs and 11 vervet monkeys — one of which died due to an infection. According to police, the smugglers used drones capable of carrying up to 70 kilograms (about 154 pounds). Southern District Commander Maj. Gen. Haim Bublil assigned the Negev Central Unit and the Wildlife Protection Unit (Magan) to investigate the case. Despite the police's ongoing efforts, no suspects have been arrested. Police say there is no information indicating that more lion cubs have been smuggled into Israel, but they estimate that two or three monkeys remain unaccounted for. In the smuggling operations, the traffickers allegedly waited near the border, collected the animals and then left the area using off-road vehicles. While smuggling from Jordan and Egypt was previously carried out on foot or by vehicle, police say drones have now 'changed the rules of the game' across hundreds of kilometers of borders. Police sources revealed that during a search operation in the Bedouin village of Bir Hadaj—located several dozen kilometers from the Egyptian border—officers found drones in almost every home they searched. The use of drones for smuggling weapons and drugs began last year. Police report that approximately 200 firearms were seized after being smuggled across the borders with Egypt and Jordan in 2023, and hundreds more were confiscated in 2024. This trend has continued into 2025, with several smuggling attempts from Sinai to Israel already thwarted. Two of these attempts were foiled just last weekend, both involving drones. Officials familiar with the investigation said the situation has led to an overflow of firearms in Israel, causing prices to drop. Despite the declining prices, drone smuggling remains profitable for criminal gangs, some of which steal the drones they use. > According to the police, these drones cost hundreds of thousands of shekels. When one is confiscated, the smugglers simply acquire another. Smuggling via drones also occurs in the Gaza Strip. Recently, the Israel Defense Forces and police spokespersons reported multiple attempts to smuggle goods from Israel into Gaza using drones, where the price of cigarettes has skyrocketed. The rescued lion cubs and monkeys — found in the Negev, central Israel, and the north — have been transferred to the Monkey Shelter and the Hai Park zoo in Kiryat Motzkin. Footage captured on Saturday shows the four lion cubs playing together. However, officials believe they are not all siblings, as the cub found near Kafr Qasem over the weekend is significantly smaller than the others. The investigation began after videos of lion cubs playing, with Arabic text in the background, circulated on social media. In recent days, two cubs were discovered in the Negev — one of them inside a pit — while a third was found in central Israel. The fourth cub, a female, was located near Kafr Qasem. Additionally, a video showing a tiger cub was shared online, though it is unclear whether it was filmed in Israel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkudm9v2yl	2025-03-16T11:41:59-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/31/B1x9v11ReZJl/B1x9v11ReZJl_0_0_1181_704_0_small.jpg

3 new F-35s join Israeli Air Force, bolstering its air superiorit...	Adir squadron - known as the Lions of the South - clocks 15,000 hours since the start of the war in strikes that include the assassination of Hezbollah leaders in Beirut and senior members of Hamas in Gaza The Israeli Air Force received a significant addition to its air superiority with three new F-35 stealth fighter jets called by the Hebrew name Adir, which arrived at the Nevatim air base last week to join the 116th squadron. According to a statement released by the IDF, the squadron accumulated over 15,000 operational flight hours since the start of the war and participated in thousands of sorties across all theaters. The stealth jets took part in operations including the assassination of the leadership of the Hezbollah terror group in Beirut and leaders of Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The jets also participated in missions deep inside Lebanon and further afield as well as in the West Bank. The Adir was the first fighter jet to shoot down a cruise missile targeting Israel in October 2023 and other hostile aerial threats, the IDF said. > 'The Adir was originally designed to carry munitions in an internal weapons bay. During the war, a new capability was integrated at the Flight Test Center in collaboration with Lockheed Martin and the F-35 Program at the Pentagon, enabling the external carriage of JDAM munitions on the aircraft’s wings,' the IDF said in its statement. 'The Israeli Adir is the only F-35 in the world to have conducted operational strikes with an external weapons configuration, significantly increasing its strike capacity.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by51zoehyg	2025-03-16T10:52:07-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/16/HkN1NSB43yl/HkN1NSB43yl_0_0_2048_1536_0_small.jpg

Rights group files lawsuit to block Trump deportations of pro-Pal...	The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) filed a lawsuit challenging as unconstitutional the Trump administration's actions to deport international students and scholars who protest or express support for Palestinian rights. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, seeks a nationwide temporary restraining order to block enforcement of two executive orders signed by U.S. President Donald Trump in the first month of his second term earlier this year. The lawsuit comes after the detention of a Columbia University student, Mahmoud Khalil, a 30-year-old permanent U.S. resident of Palestinian descent, whose arrest sparked protests this month. Trump vowed to deport activists who took part in protests on U.S. college campuses against Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza following the October 2023 attack by the terrorists. Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the decision to revoke Khalil's green card on Sunday, saying that the Trump administration was revoking visas on a daily basis. The ADC lawsuit was filed on behalf of two graduate students and a professor at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, who say their activism and support of the Palestinian people 'has put them at serious risk of political persecution.' The lawsuit centers on three Cornell University plaintiffs: a British-Gambian national and PhD student with a student visa; a U.S. citizen PhD student working on plant science; and a U.S. citizen novelist, poet, and professor in the Department of Literatures in English.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkatmqe3yg	2025-03-16T10:13:09-07:00

Netanyahu says decided to fire Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar	Prime minister summons Bar to inform him he will be bringing a decision to fire him to cabinet for approval; move expected to come before court because of prime minister's conflict of interest after Shin Bet investigates his close aides Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu summoned Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar on Sunday and informed him of his intention to fire him. The Prime Minister's Office said in a statement that Netanyahu will bring the matter for a vote in the cabinet meeting this week to end Bar's term at the head of the internal security service. According to sources in the Prime Minister's Office, Netanyahu tried to get Bar to resign but when he refused he decided to fire him. Bar, who has taken responsibility for the failings of the Shin Bet leading into the Hamas massacre of October 7, said he intended to remain in his post at least until May. He has been advocating for a national commission of inquiry into the failings of the government, the IDF and the security agencies, while Netanyahu refuses to establish such a commission. > The dismissal of the Shin Bet chief will be argued in the courts because of a conflict of interest that the prime minister is in, as the Shin Bet has been investigating allegations that close aides of Netanyahu, who work at the PMO, have worked on behalf of Qatar. The Shin Bet also is investigating allegations that a spokesperson for the prime minister leaked misinformation to foreign media during the war. The Attorney General's Office is expected to oppose the the process that Netanyahu has begun, but the prime minister has said he intends to fire Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara as well, claiming that she has been working to subvert the policies of the government. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bypkkkvhje	2025-03-16T09:48:58-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/S1LsMBvFke/S1LsMBvFke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Israeli delegation in Cairo for talks on hostage release deal	Netanyahu's office gives no further details after announcing its delegation is meeting with Egyptian officials in efforts to secure a hostage release deal; Earlier Witkoff says Hamas should learn from the US strikes on Houthis in Yemen The Prime Minister's Office said on Sunday that an Israeli team negotiating for the release of hostages held by Hamas is in Cairo for meetings with senior officials on possible hostage releases. No further details were given. Egypt and Qatar have been mediating the talks between Israel and Hamas. After the negotiating team returned from Qatar over the weekend, Netanyahu convened a security meeting with close ministers and security officials to address the stalled negotiations. According to the Prime Minister's Office, the delegation provided a briefing on the status of the talks. The possibility of resuming military operations also was discussed, including the possibilities of a broad offensive or 'targeted operations.' > U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff said earlier on Sunday that Hamas has an opportunity to accept his proposal for a limited release of five hostages after it gave a response that, in his words, was 'unacceptable.' Witkoff also warned Hamas to 'get more sensible' and said the terror group should learn what could happen to it from the U.S. strikes on the Houthi rebels in Yemen on Saturday. Hamas said last week that it would be willing to release Israeli-American Edan Alexander and four dead hostages with dual citizenship. Witkoff said Hamas was publicly appearing to show flexibility but, behind the scenes, made demands that could not be met without reaching a long-lasting ceasefire. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1moaovhjg	2025-03-16T09:42:35-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/HJYmgvQ5kg/HJYmgvQ5kg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Witkoff threatens Hamas after 'unacceptable response' in negotiat...	Envoy says attacks on Houthi targets in Yemen 'should inform Hamas of where the U.S. stands in terms of its tolerance level for terror actions' U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said on Sunday that he is encouraging Hamas to get much more sensible than they have been. Witkoff spoke to CNN and said that his proposal for a bridging agreement that would see the immediate release of five live hostages, including American Israeli citizen Edan Alexander, and extending the first phase of the ceasefire, is compelling. The Hamas response, he said, is unacceptable. 'I believe they have an opportunity, but it is slipping away quickly. What happened with the Houthis yesterday, what happened with our strike, ought to inform as to where we stand with the regard to terrorism and our tolerance level for terrorist actions - and I would encourage Hamas to get much more sensible,' Witkoff said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a meeting Saturday night to address the stalled negotiations. During the session, he received a briefing from the negotiation team that had returned from Doha. The possibility of resuming military operations was also discussed, including not only a broad offensive that Hamas 'does not recognize,' as previously threatened, but also the option of 'targeted operations.' Following the meeting, the Prime Minister’s Office described the discussion on the hostages as 'thorough.' Netanyahu instructed the negotiation team to 'prepare to continue the ceasefire talks based on the mediators’ response to the Witkoff proposal for the immediate release of 11 living hostages and half of the bodies.' Last week, Hamas announced it was prepared to release only one live hostage — Alexander — along with the bodies of four other hostages who reportedly hold dual citizenship, presumably American. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff quickly dismissed the offer as impractical, saying that while Hamas publicly presents itself as 'flexible,' behind the scenes it is making demands that are impossible to meet without a permanent ceasefire. > During talks last week in Qatar, Witkoff presented Hamas with a 'bridging proposal' to extend the current ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover, providing additional time to negotiate a permanent truce. 'Under the proposal, Hamas would release living hostages in exchange for prisoners according to previously agreed formulas. The first phase of the ceasefire would be extended to allow for the resumption of substantial humanitarian aid, and the United States would work toward a stable resolution to the ongoing conflict during this extended pause,' read a statement on the proposal. Witkoff warned Hamas that a deadline was in place, though he did not specify the timeframe. 'Hamas is making a very poor bet if it believes time is on its side. It’s not,' he said. 'Hamas is well aware of the deadline, and it should know we will respond accordingly if it passes.' His warning comes as President Donald Trump continues to threaten to give Israel the green light to resume fighting. Witkoff emphasized, however, that as long as talks are ongoing, he has asked Israel not to return to combat. The window for negotiations is expected to be a matter of days, not weeks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1o100vnh1g	2025-03-16T08:20:28-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/BySXiPzqJx/BySXiPzqJx_0_227_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
US kills senior Houthi leaders and warns Iran: The ayatollahs won...	Trump's national security adviser announced that senior Houthi officials were killed in strikes in Yemen, but did not specify how many; Mike Waltz demanded that Iran stop aiding the terrorist organization; Defense Minister Pete Hegseth: 'The attacks will continue until the Houthis say' ‘We’re done shooting at ships.'; He emphasized that the operation was not intended to change the government situation in Yemen: 'We don't care what's happening in the civil war there' U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said Sunday afternoon that several 'leaders' of the Houthi terror group were eliminated in the latest wave of U.S. airstrikes in Yemen. He did not specify how many were killed. Earlier reports in Arab media claimed six senior Houthi officials were killed, though these reports have not been independently verified. Waltz himself did not provide names or clarify the rank of those killed. In an interview with ABC News, Waltz described the strikes as the most extensive to date, emphasizing — as did President Donald Trump — the difference between these attacks and the more limited strikes carried out under former President Joe Biden. 'This wasn’t a pinprick, or repeated strikes that ultimately proved weak,' Waltz said, referring to Biden-era attacks that were highly measured and primarily aimed at thwarting imminent Houthi threats to ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Waltz said the current strikes represent a 'decisive response' that has targeted and killed several Houthi leaders. He added that a key difference in Trump’s approach is holding Iran accountable for its support and financing of the Houthis. That backing, he said, has enabled the group to disrupt critical maritime trade routes through the Red Sea and Suez Canal under the guise of supporting Palestinians since the war in Gaza began. Waltz stressed that Iran should 'hear clearly' the message from Washington and immediately end its support for the Houthis, echoing Trump’s warning Saturday night at the launch of the air campaign. Waltz did not rule out potential strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, citing Tehran’s continued refusal to engage in negotiations for a new nuclear agreement and its rejection of harsher U.S. sanctions. 'All options are on the table,' he said. 'We cannot accept a world where the ayatollahs have their finger on the nuclear button.' Meanwhile, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Sunday that the U.S. strikes would continue until the Houthi threat to international shipping lanes is eliminated. 'This will continue until they say, ‘We’re done shooting at ships. We’re done shooting at assets,’' Hegseth said in an interview with Fox News. Hegseth also called on Iran to withdraw its support for the Houthis, emphasizing that the Trump administration’s actions in Yemen are aimed solely at ending attacks on Red Sea shipping — not at intervening in Yemen’s ongoing civil war. 'We don’t care about Yemen’s civil war,' Hegseth said. 'These strikes are about stopping attacks on a critical maritime route.' Secretary of State Marco Rubio also addressed the strikes, clarifying that a U.S. ground operation in Yemen is not under consideration at this time. 'I don’t think there’s any need for that right now,' he said. Like Hegseth, Rubio indicated that the air campaign will continue until the Houthis no longer have the capacity to attack commercial shipping. The U.S. offensive against the Houthis began Saturday night with a large wave of strikes on multiple targets in Houthi-controlled areas, including the capital, Sanaa. The Houthis claimed at least 31 people were killed in the attacks, including women and children, and reported more than 100 injuries. U.S. media outlets reported that the strikes, which continued through the night, are expected to last for several days—and possibly weeks. Washington has made clear that the campaign will continue until the Houthi threat to global trade through the Red Sea is neutralized. The Wall Street Journal reported that, according to two officials briefed by the Trump administration, the air campaign has three objectives: to destroy Houthi missile launchers aimed at ships, to eliminate the group’s leadership, and to send a message to Iran as it continues to reject negotiations for a new nuclear deal. In addition to military sites, Saturday night’s strikes reportedly targeted the homes of Houthi leaders in Sanaa, as well as missile launchers being moved to coastal areas in preparation for new attacks on ships. According to Arab media reports, the Houthis have since emptied their missile warehouses and relocated them to underground facilities. Despite the strikes, they vow to continue what they describe as their 'campaign of support for Palestine.' The Houthis have also threatened retaliation, raising concerns that Israel may once again become a target. The Houthis halted missile and drone attacks following the cease-fire in Gaza but announced last week they would resume what they called a 'naval blockade' on Israel, threatening ships passing near Yemen’s shores after Israel temporarily suspended humanitarian aid to Gaza as leverage on Hamas. 'The strikes will not deter Yemen from continuing to support Palestine and Gaza. They will not go unanswered,' the Houthis' political bureau said Saturday night. On Sunday afternoon, the group claimed that the American strikes themselves now pose a 'serious threat' to Red Sea shipping routes — an indication they may escalate their attacks on commercial vessels in retaliation. Following the wave of U.S. airstrikes against the Houthis in Yemen overnight, Sky News Arabia reported Sunday that the Iran-backed terror group has ordered its leaders to evacuate their homes out of fear they will be targeted by American warplanes. 'They are instructing their leaders to avoid government buildings or headquarters that could be attacked,' the report said. It also noted that the Houthis are replacing some members of their personal security teams over concerns about potential security breaches. At the same time, Saudi television network Al Arabiya reported that several military officials were killed in the U.S. strikes in Yemen’s Al Bayda region. The report also stated that Houthi leaders have relocated in recent hours, with some leaving the capital, Sanaa, for the provinces of Saada and Amran. In addition, the group reportedly emptied its missile warehouses after the strikes. Meanwhile, Saudi channel Al Hadath reported that the Houthis moved the missiles to underground locations in anticipation of further attacks and transferred military equipment to Yemen’s western coast. The reports come as the Houthis insist that the U.S. operation will not deter them from continuing their campaign 'for Palestine.' Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a member of the Houthis’ political bureau, told Hezbollah-affiliated Al Mayadeen on Saturday that 'the U.S. strikes are unjustified because our actions are directed against Israel.' He warned, 'A response to American aggression is coming. For us, there is no difference between the Trump and Biden administrations. We will not withdraw our support for Palestine. U.S. President Donald Trump announced the operation Saturday night on his social media platform Truth Social, stating he had ordered the offensive against the Houthis. 'The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated,' Trump wrote. 'We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.' > Trump called former President Joe Biden’s response to previous attacks 'pathetically weak' and issued a direct warning to the Houthis: 'Your time is up. and your attacks must stop starting today. If they don't, hell will rain down upon you like nothing you have ever seen before!' Trump also warned Iran, the Houthis’ main backer, at the onset of the strikes. He demanded Tehran 'immediately' cease its support for the Houthis. He added, 'Support for the Houthi terrorists must end IMMEDIATELY! Do NOT threaten the American People, their President, who has received one of the largest mandates in Presidential History, or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won’t be nice about it!' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skt8vve3yg	2025-03-16T07:46:14-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/16/HynPbvNhkx/HynPbvNhkx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Security forces foil Ramadan terror plot in Jerusalem, Arab Israe...	Odae Mobarsham, resident of Arab town of Jadeidi-Makr in Western Galilee, accused of planning shooting attack against police officers and Jewish civilians at Old City's Damascus Gate using illegally obtained firearm A northern Israel man was charged on Sunday with planning a shooting attack targeting police officers and Jewish civilians in Jerusalem's Old City during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The Haifa District Attorney’s Office filed an indictment against Odae Mobarsham, a resident of the Arab town of Jadeidi-Makr in Western Galilee, accusing him of planning the attack as an 'expression of solidarity with the Palestinian cause.' Prosecutors say Mobarsham intended to carry out the attack at Damascus Gate using an illegally obtained firearm. According to a joint statement from police and the Shin Bet security agency, Mobarsham was arrested last month by officers from the Crime Fighting Unit (YALP) and Special Patrol Unit (Yasam). Investigators determined that he had acquired a firearm, trained with it and attempted to recruit others to join him in the attack. The weapon was later found in the possession of his brother, who has also been charged for assisting in hiding it. A senior Shin Bet official described the arrest as a 'significant counterterrorism success,' emphasizing that had the attack been carried out during Ramadan, it could have led to a 'dangerous escalation' in Jerusalem at a time of heightened security tensions. > 'The Shin Bet and Israeli police view any involvement of Israeli citizens in activities that threaten national security with the utmost severity,' the statement said. 'We will continue working with law enforcement agencies to ensure that those involved are brought to justice.' The arrest comes amid a particularly sensitive period as Ramadan—a time of heightened religious fervor—coincides with ongoing security concerns following over a year of war and instability. While Israel has recorded a decline in attacks in recent weeks, officials remain on high alert due to increased weapons smuggling into Palestinian territories, economic strains in the West Bank and the recent release of convicted terrorists as part of the hostage deal with Hamas. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Security Cabinet approved a limited entry permit for Palestinian worshippers from the West Bank to pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem on Fridays during Ramadan. The Prime Minister’s Office said that the restrictions are in line with those enforced in previous years. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkb8nhe31e	2025-03-16T05:03:07-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/06/05/ByMoo8ZCE0/ByMoo8ZCE0_0_100_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Brigadier general, now under investigation, admits to accidentally dropping documents; sources say officer recently linked to another case involving alleged military regulation violations Classified and highly sensitive military documents were found in recent weeks in a parking lot of an office tower in Ramat Gan by a passerby, who turned them over to the building's security officer, ynetnews has learned. The officer immediately reported the incident to police and the IDF. Military sources confirmed the details and said an internal security investigation determined that the documents belonged to a retired brigadier general. According to the findings, the officer accidentally dropped them after leaving his car to attend a civilian meeting in the building. He later admitted to the mistake, and officials noted he should not have removed the sensitive materials from the military base—let alone left them unattended. The incident is being handled at the command level, and the military is still assessing whether any security damage was caused by the breach. The IDF’s Military Police Criminal Investigation Division (MPCID) has not launched a formal probe, and the officer has not been suspended. > Military sources added that the officer’s name was recently linked to another embarrassing affair involving alleged violations of IDF regulations.

Yarden Bibas picks up the pieces and moves forward following unim...	Six weeks after returning from Hamas captivity, Yarden Bibas faces the loss of his wife and sons while learning to rebuild his life; A crowdfunding campaign aims to support his recovery and memorialize his family through meaningful initiatives About six weeks have passed since Yarden Bibas was released from Hamas captivity after nearly 500 days in the dark tunnels. Embraced by his sister, parents and relatives, he is trying to process the unbearable loss of his wife, Shiri, and his sons, Ariel and Kfir, who were murdered in captivity. Without the family he built, the home he lived in at Nir Oz or the community and kibbutz he loved, Yarden is now drawing upon immense strength and has decided to choose life as he learns to start anew. Yarden's challenges are numerous and complex, and his family is trying to ease at least one of them. Alongside the financial support provided by the state, his family has launched a crowdfunding campaign, with the help of the Reach Hands charity, to support him and memorialize his family. In an interview with Ynet and its sister publication Yedioth Ahronoth, his sister, Ofri Bibas-Levy, shares thoughts on choosing life, Yarden's daily journey of recovery, the decision to launch the campaign and hopes for the future: 'To do good for others.' 'When I saw Yarden in the video released by Hamas, where they informed him that Shiri and the boys had been killed, I thought to myself, 'That's it. I've lost my brother.' I couldn’t imagine a scenario where he would survive that news, especially while still in captivity, completely alone,' Ofri shares. 'We were terrified for him, afraid he might harm himself. But we were astonished by the strength he emerged with. We feared he would come out broken, shattered, but instead, he came out with strength he didn’t have before. It amazes us every day and gives us the strength to fight for him, for his life and alongside him.' According to her, 'Even back then, in captivity, he chose life. Despite the immense pain, loss and longing, Yarden decided he wanted to live. The goal of the campaign is to help him achieve that. The state provides financial support, primarily through grants, but as I understand, most of these are one-time payments or valid for only a year. We realize that going forward, he will likely need more. I don’t know what his therapeutic framework will be. Right now, he’s still connected to Sheba Medical Center, but he might need additional private treatments later. I don’t know where he’ll live or what the support system there will look like. 'We want to ensure that Yarden can choose and follow the right path for him, without being forced into decisions due to financial constraints. Yarden isn’t asking for anything for himself—we’re asking on his behalf. He went through hell for 16 months and is now grappling with unbearable loss, with questions like, 'What am I doing? Where do I go from here?' He hasn’t even started processing the trauma of captivity yet. That will come at some point, and we can’t predict how difficult it will be. It’s a long road, with ups and downs.' Ofri explains that the second goal of the campaign, which officially launched Saturday night, is to memorialize Shiri and the boys. 'It’s clear to us that the memorial will involve doing something good for others, especially for children, perhaps in the field of education,' she says. 'This is true both for Ariel and Kfir, and for Shiri, whose essence was education. As a person and as a mother, that was her nature.' Since October 7, the Bibas family has had few moments of rest. Even now, they juggle between an intense daily routine and the desire to allow Yarden to move slowly and safely on his journey. 'Yarden is trying to think practically—where he’ll be closer to friends and family, where there are better job opportunities. Yes, he’s talking about work. He doesn’t intend to stay at home. Yarden is looking ahead. Nothing is set yet, and it’s important for us that this process happens at his own pace,' Ofri says. 'The past 16 months have been a nightmare, and while the four members of our family have returned, we’re still in a race. We haven’t had a moment to let things sink in, to stop and process—Yarden's return, Shiri and the kids' loss. I tell him, 'Take your time,' but every day feels like a week. In the meantime, we’re protecting Yarden, and he’s protecting himself. We’re amazed, especially him, by the love and support he’s received, as well as for our family. He mentioned this in his eulogy. We couldn’t have imagined the number of people who came to the shiva. Yarden sat for hours, shaking hands with everyone who came to honor and comfort him. We told him, 'You can take some time alone in the room,' and he said, 'No way. People came to support and help me; they came to comfort me. I’ll sit there and shake their hands.' He said he wished he could hug each and every one of them. This shows his strength.' > How does this strength manifest in everyday life? 'In the mornings, Yarden tries to go for walks with my dad. It’s very important to him not to stay in his room all day. Even when he doesn’t feel like going out, he forces himself to go. He says that without it, he’ll retreat into his room, and he doesn’t want that. He also listens to a lot of music. Music has always been a source of comfort and release for him. It encourages him, lifts his spirits. He spends time with friends and family. We’ve even had evenings where we laughed so hard that our stomachs hurt. There’s a mix of everything.' The journey is also physical. 'Yes. Yarden lost a lot of weight, along with muscle mass. He wants to exercise and regain his strength. He has an appetite, though he still hasn’t returned to eating meat like he used to love. But he makes sure to eat meals regularly. We all imagined something different—that he’d show behaviors he adopted during captivity, like sitting on the floor or similar things. I remember when Yarden came back, we sat and talked, and I couldn’t believe it—how is it possible that just three hours ago, you were in a tunnel? For him and for us, it will take a long time to fully understand this. Even professionals are learning new things from the returnees.' Fifty-nine hostages remain in Gaza, including Yarden’s best friend, David Cunio, and his brother Ariel. Ofri doesn’t stop advocating for their return. 'People ask me if I feel relief or peace, and yes, having four family members back brings some calm. But can I tell you I’m not on edge? I read the news and want to scream. We’re on edge, shaken by negotiations, discussions and conversations. It’s devastating. Just a moment ago, I was in the same position as the other families reading these headlines, and for me, until everyone is back, we’re still in this fight together. 'The day after the funeral, I spoke to a government minister about what happens next. I told him, 'I drove in the convoy and looked all of Israel in the eye. Everyone’s tears weren’t just for the Bibas family. People were releasing 16 months of loss, pain and questions—when will this nightmare end?' He told me, 'I’m not on the Cabinet.' Such a lack of accountability. You’re a minister in the government, in the elected party. Raise your voice to end the war, take action. We all understand that’s the way to bring the hostages back. Coming to offer condolences while doing nothing to prevent the need to console the next family—what’s the point? That’s why I didn’t want them at the shiva. They talk like they did 16 months ago, dragging their feet as if there’s time. Meanwhile, everyone was horrified by how Eli, Or and Ohad returned,' she added, referring to Or Levy and Ohad Ben Ami, who were released alongside her brother. And how are you in all this? How are you coping? 'There are moments when an image of Shiri, Ariel and Kfir suddenly flashes in my mind, imagining them here, and then I remember—they're not, and they never will be. They weren’t here for 16 months, and my daily life without them hasn’t changed—only now it’s final. The funeral didn’t create a clear break between then and now. It will take a long time to process that the longing and emptiness we’ve felt for a year and a half are permanent. I don’t really know how to make sense of such loss.'

Christians in Syria caught in wave of sectarian killings, stoking...	Recent sectarian violence in Syria’s coastal region killed over 1,000 Alawites and several Christians, deepening fears among the shrinking Christian minority about their future and prompting church leaders to urge national reconciliation Fears have grown within Syria's Christian community following a wave of sectarian violence in the coastal region between March 6 and 10. The clashes resulted in the deaths of 1,064 Alawite civilians, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, in addition to the deaths of seven Christian civilians, according to documentation by The Media Line from local and church sources. A church source in Latakia, who requested anonymity for security reasons, confirmed that the recent events had been 'extremely difficult' and had exacerbated concerns about the future of Christian presence in Syria, as well as that of other religious minorities in the country. 'This is not just a military escalation; it is a direct threat to Syria’s social fabric. The Christian community feels isolated and fears becoming a victim of sectarian conflicts it has no involvement in,' the source said. Among the civilian victims were Tony Boutros and his son Fadi, who were killed while driving their car on the Latakia International Highway. They were caught in fierce clashes between Syrian government forces and remnants of the former regime, leading to their injuries and eventual deaths. George Bakhash, secretary of Aleppo's governorate and a coordinator for Christian denominations in the city, confirmed that seven Christian civilians were documented as having been killed in the recent events. However, he emphasized that Christians 'did not take part in the conflict and did not align with any side against another.' Bakhash told The Media Line that he documented the killing of a man and his son by an armed group that intercepted their path to Latakia—Tony Boutros and his son—along with four other members of the same family who were killed inside their home in a predominantly Alawite neighborhood in Latakia. Additionally, the father of Father Gregorius Beshara was killed in the coastal city of Banias. All were civilians. While some media outlets reported the killing of a priest named Yohanna Youssef Boutros, sources confirmed that this information was inaccurate. A senior church source in Syria clarified that no priest had been killed in the events, stating that there was no priest by that name in Syria and that such reports were false. On the other hand, two separate sources told The Media Line that the number of Christian deaths in the recent clashes did not exceed four, asserting that the other three had been killed in previous incidents unrelated to the latest events. Bashir Saadi, deputy head of the Assyrian Democratic Organization, said that 'the number of Christian deaths in the coastal events was four,' but he blamed 'remnants of the Syrian regime' for fueling the escalation, arguing that they were the biggest beneficiaries of the chaos. Ayman Abdel Nour, a Syrian-American politician based in Washington, agreed with this perspective, saying that reports claiming higher numbers of Christian casualties were 'exaggerated' and exploited for political purposes. He confirmed that the number of Christian victims in the clashes did not exceed seven. Regarding this dispute over numbers, George Bakhash reaffirmed that 'the official number of Christians killed in the recent coastal events is seven,' adding that those claiming only four rely on outdated records. 'We documented the victims accurately,' he said, reiterating the real fears Christians in Syria face. Church measures and international reactions As violence escalated, churches in Latakia suspended all religious activities, resorting to broadcasting prayers online to avoid endangering worshippers. In a significant move, the leaders of Syria’s major Christian churches—including Patriarch John X of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch, Patriarch Ignatius Aphrem II of the Syriac Orthodox Church and Patriarch Joseph Absi of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church—issued a joint statement condemning 'the rise in violence, killings and looting,' calling for comprehensive national reconciliation. Metropolitan Ephrem Maalouli, Archbishop of Aleppo and Alexandretta for the Greek Orthodox Church, described the current situation as 'deeply concerning,' noting that 'the Christian community faces real fears about its future in Syria, especially after the massive emigration that has taken place in recent years.' 'What happened in the coastal region is deeply painful. Christians were never part of the conflict, yet they find themselves caught in the cycle of violence,' he added. While most Christians have remained neutral since the outbreak of the Syrian conflict in 2011, some groups, such as the forces of Nayel Al-Abdullah in Sqeilbiyah, have fought alongside the Syrian regime with Russian support. > Al-Abdullah, who has since become a prominent religious figure, leads an armed militia claiming to defend Christians. However, he has been accused of participating in military operations targeting civilians in neighboring areas and recruiting children under the pretext of 'sacred defense.' Political activist Mishaal Al-Adawi told The Media Line that Nayel Al-Abdullah 'is accused of committing numerous massacres against civilians. He fought alongside Assad,' according to Al-Adawi and other Syrian activists. Before 2011, the Christian population in Syria was estimated at 1.5 million, around 10% of the country’s total population. However, after more than a decade of war, that number has dwindled to approximately 300,000, constituting less than 2% of Syria’s current population, according to 2022 estimates. Today, Christian communities are mainly concentrated in Damascus, Aleppo, Qamishli and Hama, as well as in the coastal towns of Sqeilbiyah and Mhardeh and some villages in Idlib province. As the conflict continues, the fate of Syria’s Christians remains uncertain. While church leaders emphasize the need to preserve civil peace, many fear that they will once again become victims of conflicts in which they have no stake. The question remains: Can Syria achieve national reconciliation that protects all its religious communities, or will emigration continue to be the only option for its minorities?

Hezbollah condemns US strikes against Yemen, stresses solidarity	Hezbollah condemned on Sunday large-scale military strikes by the U.S. against Yemen, according to a statement.

Missile launched from Yemen lands in Egypt; Israel investigates p...	Projectile crashes near Sharm el-Sheikh, but no impacts detected in Israel and no additional threats identified, IDF reports The IDF is investigating whether a missile launched from Yemen and landing in Egypt overnight was intended to strike Israel, the military said Sunday. According to the IDF, the missile crashed near Sharm el-Sheikh of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, but no impacts were detected within Israeli territory, and no other immediate threats were identified. The last known launches from Yemen before the temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas occurred on Jan. 9, when the IDF reported that the Air Force intercepted three drones launched by the Houthis within an hour. Earlier that day, the IDF released data showing that since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, approximately 320 drones had been fired from Yemen toward Israel. More than 100 were intercepted, while the rest either landed in unpopulated areas, failed to reach Israeli airspace or caused no significant damage, according to the military. > The overnight incident came just hours after the U.S. launched an unprecedented bombing campaign of Houthi strongholds in Yemen as the Iran-backed terror group renewed its threats on Red Sea shipping. The Houthi-run health ministry reported at least 31 fatalities in the attacks. Reports suggest the U.S. offensive is the beginning of a sustained response to renewed Houthi threats against Israel and vessels sailing to its ports through the Red Sea. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has blamed Iran for supporting the Houthis’ attacks on Red Sea shipping, warned Tehran to halt its backing of the group immediately. 'Support for the Houthi terrorists must end IMMEDIATELY!' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'Do NOT threaten the American People, their President, who has received one of the largest mandates in Presidential History, or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won’t be nice about it!' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1aslqv3je	2025-03-16T02:37:04-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/16/SkXvdYWEhke/SkXvdYWEhke_0_114_2736_1541_0_small.jpg
Got to give it to Hamas': Ex-IDF chief acknowledges military fai...	In closed-door meeting, Herzi Halevi admits military failed to anticipate terror groups’ attack, revealing forces arrived only after terrorists had left; internal probe found Hamas used humanitarian gestures to mislead Israel before October 7 Former Israeli military chief Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi admitted in a newly revealed recording that Hamas successfully deceived Israel ahead of its deadly October 7 attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz, one of the hardest-hit communities in the assault. 'I have no choice but to acknowledge Hamas for the deception they pulled on us,' Halevi said last week in a closed-door meeting with Nir Oz residents, according to recordings published by Army Radio on Sunday. 'Got to give it to them—they tricked us completely.' Halevi, who was Israel Defense Forces chief of staff at the time of the attack, described how Hamas misled Israeli intelligence in the days before the assault. 'They succeeded in deceiving us with the disturbances before [October 7], their efforts to calm things down, and their focus on humanitarian issues,' he said. 'They used that to put us to sleep and prepare their attack—and their deception worked.' His remarks came during a presentation of the military’s internal investigation into the attack, which was also attended by former Southern Command Chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman. The findings detailed Israel’s failure to anticipate and respond to the Hamas-led onslaught, which left Nir Oz devastated. One in four residents of the kibbutz was either killed or taken hostage. Delayed military response Halevi acknowledged the scale of the military’s failure, revealing that security forces did not enter the kibbutz until long after the attack had ended. 'The first soldier arrived in Nir Oz only after the last terrorist left,' he said. 'This is a terrible, horrifying statement, and we repeat it so that everyone in the IDF will remember it.' According to the findings, it took 40 minutes after the last Hamas attackers withdrew from Nir Oz before any security personnel entered the area. The first responders were not IDF soldiers but Border Police undercover officers who arrived after an emergency call to the police. By then, the attackers had rampaged through the kibbutz for seven hours. > 'There was no battle, no engagement in Nir Oz,' Halevi said. 'This was the failure within the failure of October 7.' Apologies and accountability The investigation, led by Maj. Gen. (res.) Eran Niv, compiled thousands of testimonies, recordings, and photographs over eight months. The findings were presented to survivors—including former hostages—at a closed-door session, where phones were collected at the entrance to prevent leaks and trauma counselors were available for support. Niv opened the briefing with an apology. Residents later said the findings did not reveal much new information, but they described the military officials as 'fully transparent' about their failures. 'They apologized over and over again,' one resident said. 'They told us outright: ‘We failed, we failed, we failed.’' Halevi emphasized the need for Israel to prioritize the recovery of affected communities. 'The state must invest significant resources to strengthen the people first, and then the places,' he said. 'And I tell you this: I am one of you.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1pgtgnnje	2025-03-16T01:51:10-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/14/rJcKOPb21l/rJcKOPb21l_0_0_853_481_0_small.jpg

The shocking story of the Olympic star who became a Hezbollah-lin...	Ryan Wedding, once a Canadian Olympic snowboarder, became a top drug lord tied to the Sinaloa Cartel and Hezbollah; now among the FBI’s 10 most-wanted criminals, he’s accused of drug trafficking, money laundering and murder; $10M reward offered for his capture Heavy rain poured through the streets of Washington as veteran detective Frank Callahan stepped into the FBI offices. Waiting for him on his desk was a thick file, bearing a name that sent a chill down his spine: Ryan Wedding. Two decades ago, that name—who would have believed it?—was synonymous with Olympic hope, a gifted snowboarder who brought pride to Canada. Today? The same name was listed among the world’s ten most-wanted criminals, how the tables turn. Callahan opened the file, revealing blurry photographs, encrypted messages, and maps marked with red arrows stretching across borders, ports, and dimly lit warehouses. The man who once soared down snowy slopes had become a calculating criminal mastermind. The snow had been replaced by dark alleyways, and his dreams no longer revolved around medals but around drugs and death. Yet the question that haunted Callahan the most was simple: How had a revered athlete like Wedding transformed into a ruthless drug lord? A $10 million bounty Wedding’s bizarre story made headlines over the weekend after authorities in the United States, Canada, and Mexico announced an unprecedented $10 million reward for information leading to his capture, according to an FBI statement. 'Wedding went from competing on Olympic slopes to flooding the streets of the U.S. and Canada with cocaine,' officials said. 'The murders attributed to him make him an extremely dangerous man.' So how did it all begin? Born in 1981 in Thunder Bay, Canada, Wedding grew up in Coquitlam, British Columbia. He trained as a professional snowboarder and was once considered one of Canada’s brightest hopes in the 2002 Winter Olympics, where he competed in slalom and finished 24th. 'One of Canada’s most promising winter sports athletes,' Canadian media wrote about him at the start of the millennium. However, as you may have guessed, his sports career did not last long. About a year after the Olympics, he began entangling himself with the criminal underworld. According to reports in The Vancouver Sun, Wedding gradually entered the drug trade, ultimately becoming one of North America's most powerful cartel leaders. 'Don Corleone, the Canadian version,' local media quipped—half in jest, half in frustration. In reality, that wasn’t far from the truth. Wedding became a high-ranking figure in the notorious Sinaloa Cartel. How high? A quick internet search would tell you all you need to know. Founded in the late 1980s by Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, the Sinaloa Cartel was led by Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán (yes, the same one from the Netflix series). Guzmán twice escaped from Mexican prisons before being captured in 2016. The cartel is one of Mexico’s most established and long-standing drug trafficking organizations. Named after the northwestern Mexican state where it was founded, the cartel supplied a significant portion of the fentanyl, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and marijuana sold on American streets, with Wedding acting as its primary smuggler and liaison. Wedding himself remains on the run. A Canadian mafia version of Al Capone. Authorities believe he is hiding in Mexico, Canada, Colombia, or other parts of Latin America, moving between safe houses every few days. Drug smuggling and terrorist ties The cartel controls drug trafficking routes in Arizona and California and has distribution centers in several U.S. cities. It has also been linked to fentanyl production facilities in Mexico. According to reports, the cartel controlled an estimated 40–60% of Mexico’s drug trade in the early 2010s, generating up to $3 billion annually. An American indictment released last year alleged that the cartel laundered about $900,000 in Bitcoin between August 2022 and February 2023. The cartel has also been a major driver of the ongoing violence in Mexico, which has claimed tens of thousands of lives. > And Wedding has ties to none other than Hezbollah. Before his first drug trafficking arrest, Wedding reportedly used an Iranian-Canadian suspect’s 'cultural' money-laundering network to transfer $100,000 for a deal. An FBI investigation later revealed that his drug smuggling routes included Margarita Island in Venezuela, a known training hub for Hezbollah, the Iran-backed terrorist organization. Last year, the head of intelligence at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Carrie Thompson, warned Congress about the 'clear link between drug trafficking and the financing of terrorist organizations and hostile state actors, including the Iranian regime.' The FBI also found that Iranian crime networks—including one involving Wedding’s murdered associate, Wayne Meshkati—were engaged in large-scale cartel operations. Wedding’s criminal empire By age 29, Wedding had already been convicted of drug trafficking and was serving time in a Texas prison. On February 14, 2011—while still incarcerated—he said 'I do' to a British Columbia businesswoman of Iranian descent. Her name later surfaced in a Vancouver trial involving violent kidnapping and extortion. Her identity remains classified by the FBI, but after a short period, the two divorced. In a rare interview with Canadian media, Wedding’s ex-wife claimed that he had told her he was only convicted because he was 'in the wrong place at the wrong time.' She said they had not spoken in years, and she has since remarried. 'I don’t want to be associated with these people,' she said. Her name has not been made public since she was never charged with a crime. However, she was mentioned in at least two police investigations in Canada related to drug trafficking and kidnapping—allegations she denies. So, who to believe? A tough question. FBI Assistant Director Akil Davis of the Los Angeles field office described Wedding as 'a dangerous man who has demonstrated a ruthless willingness to kill to protect his criminal empire.' He added that placing Wedding on the FBI’s Most Wanted list ensures that 'every possible resource will be deployed to bring him to justice.' Canadian authorities share the same commitment. Liam Price, head of investigations at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), stated, 'He remains one of the greatest organized crime threats in Canada. We are working closely with U.S. and Mexican authorities to ensure he faces justice.' Matthew Allen, a special agent with the DEA, noted, 'This is a man who amassed wealth at the expense of countless lives. His ‘empire’ has fueled violence, addiction, and death across multiple countries.' U.S. Attorney Joseph McNally added, 'We urge anyone with information to come forward. Capturing Wedding would be a significant victory for public safety and international law enforcement.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/ry00vvwvnjg	2025-03-16T01:43:04-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/10/BJqm2U3skl/BJqm2U3skl_0_267_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is said to have sent several envoys in recent days to Knesset member Itamar Ben Gvir, offering him and his party, Otzma Yehudit, billions of shekels in exchange for rejoining the coalition. The move comes as Netanyahu seeks to pass the state budget in the Knesset by the end of the month. Ben Gvir has conditioned his return on several demands, including a renewed military offensive in the Gaza Strip. The Prime Minister’s Office denied the report, stating: 'Netanyahu is certainly interested in Ben Gvir’s return to the coalition, but contrary to reports, he did not offer him 'billions.''	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rksfbzenyl	2025-03-16T01:11:44-07:00

Israeli-Russian hacker extradited to US over global ransomware at...	Rostislav Panev faces charges for alleged role as developer for LockBit ransomware group, which authorities say caused $500 million in damages An Israeli-Russian citizen accused of developing ransomware used in cyberattacks worldwide has been extradited from Israel to the United States, authorities announced over the weekend. Rostislav Panev, 51, of Haifa, was arrested in August 2024 at the request of the United States and was extradited to face charges for his alleged role as a developer for LockBit, a ransomware group that has targeted thousands of victims globally. LockBit, which has been active since 2019, is considered one of the world’s most destructive ransomware groups, carrying out attacks on more than 2,500 victims in over 120 countries, including approximately 1,800 in the U.S. The group’s targets have included small businesses, multinational corporations, hospitals, schools, nonprofit organizations, government agencies and critical infrastructure. According to investigators, LockBit’s operations have caused an estimated $500 million in damages. Authorities say the group has ties to Russian intelligence and uses advanced techniques to disrupt critical systems. Ties to ransomware development Court documents state that Panev worked as a developer for LockBit since its inception, creating and maintaining the group’s malicious software. He allegedly received more than $230,000 in cryptocurrency for his work. Investigators linked him to the group after finding login credentials on his computer for a repository storing different versions of LockBit’s malware tools. During questioning by Israeli authorities, Panev admitted to writing and maintaining the ransomware code, according to law enforcement officials. He is the third alleged LockBit member to be arrested. Authorities previously detained Mikhail Vasiliev, a Russian-Canadian national, who remains in custody in Canada awaiting extradition to the U.S., and Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov, a Russian citizen, who is being held in the U.S. while awaiting trial. The U.S. government has offered a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the capture of the group’s alleged leader, Dmitry Khoroshev. International investigation Panev was arrested in Haifa on Aug. 18, 2024, after the U.S. submitted a formal extradition request. Israeli Justice Minister Yariv Levin signed the extradition order, and a hearing was scheduled for Jan. 5, 2025, in the Jerusalem District Court. > Investigators seized ransom notes that LockBit allegedly sent to victims, as well as digital wallets authorities say were used to pay Panev for his work. FBI agents traveled to Israel to question him but were unable to do so after his attorney, Sharon Nahari, objected. A similar request from French authorities was also denied. A gag order had been placed on the case at the request of U.S. authorities, who feared that publicity could lead other suspects to flee to Russia, undermining the investigation. Nahari, who specializes in white-collar crimes and extradition cases, said in a statement: 'My client is a computer technician. His role was limited to software development, and he was neither aware of nor involved in the main offenses he is accused of—fraud, extortion and money laundering.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by9yfx4hyx	2025-03-16T00:35:39-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/06/05/Hk6exqpEA/Hk6exqpEA_0_0_882_514_0_small.jpg

Iran warns US of 'decisive and destructive' response amid Houthi ...	Iran’s Revolutionary Guards chief Hossein Salami warned Sunday that Tehran would respond 'decisively and destructively' if U.S. threats materialize, following American airstrikes on Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis. Salami downplayed Iran’s role in the conflict, insisting the Houthis are independent and make their own strategic and operational decisions. His remarks came after U.S. President Donald Trump launched a major military campaign against the Houthis, targeting their Red Sea shipping attacks and killing at least 31 people. Trump also issued a direct warning to Iran, the Houthis’ main backer, saying, 'BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won’t be nice about it!' The unfolding airstrikes, which could last weeks, mark the largest U.S. military operation in the Middle East since Trump took office, as Washington escalates pressure on Tehran amid stalled nuclear negotiations.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syhqi11vhke	2025-03-16T00:27:56-07:00

Buying Property Remotely: Growing Interest in Israeli Real Estate...	Bringing the Market to You: 50 representatives from Israel’s leading construction and development companies are set to arrive in the U.S. and Canada for a major real estate expo. The event will take place in four key locations—Toronto, Lakewood, Teaneck, and Long Island. What’s driving the growing interest in Israeli real estate, and what defines the buying habits of Jewish communities abroad? In recent years, interest in purchasing real estate in Israel among Jews living abroad has grown significantly, reflected in the increasing number of expos and the rising volume of completed transactions. 'Five years ago, we held just two or three expos annually,' says Gidon Katz, a leading expert in marketing Israeli real estate to the global Jewish community for nearly three decades. According to Katz, 'Last year alone, we hosted 18 real estate expos, and this year, we anticipate between 15 and 20 events.' Why Are More Jews Looking to Buy Property in Israel? The growing demand stems from various factors—some attendees are planning to make Aliyah in the coming years, while others seek a vacation home or a property for extended family visits. Many view Israeli real estate as a sound investment, driven by the market’s steady appreciation. Additionally, rising antisemitic incidents worldwide have led some buyers to see Israel as a secure foothold for the future. 'There are people planning to make Aliyah in two or three years, so they purchase an apartment in a new project now, knowing it will be ready when they arrive,' Katz explains. 'Others simply want a home for summer visits. Each of these motivations contributes to the rising demand.' What Does the Expo Offer, and Why Is It Attracting a Large Audience? The real estate expos provide buyers with a convenient platform to explore a wide range of projects, speak directly with company representatives, and evaluate investment opportunities—all without having to travel to Israel. 'The expo functions much like the national real estate fairs held in Israel,' explains Gidon Katz. 'Companies present multiple projects, sales representatives are available, and visitors can move from booth to booth, learn about different opportunities, and decide what suits them best.' What sets this expo apart is that it centralizes all essential information for Jewish buyers abroad, covering both real estate projects and financial and legal aspects of purchasing a property in Israel. 'Fifty representatives are coming from Israel, each from a different company,' says Katz. 'Among them are Chief Marketing Officers and National Sales Directors from leading firms such as Azorim, Acro, Tidhar, and Rothstein. Having senior executives present allows for more flexibility—unlike junior sales reps, they have the authority to approve certain requests on the spot.' In addition, real estate brokers specializing in second-hand properties, lawyers, mortgage consultants, and financial transfer experts will also be available, ensuring that anyone looking for guidance on purchasing a property in Israel can get answers immediately.' Why Is the Expo Conducted in English, and How Does It Benefit Buyers? One of the expo’s key advantages is the accessibility of information in English. 'We ensure that buyers meet sales representatives who speak their language, which isn’t always guaranteed when visiting sales offices in Israel,' Katz points out. 'When senior executives from major companies attend, it also allows buyers to make decisions on the spot and secure deals under more favorable conditions.' Where Are Jewish Investors Buying Real Estate in Israel? Interest in Israeli real estate among Jews abroad is primarily focused on cities and areas with a strong Anglo presence. 'The classic locations are Jerusalem, Beit Shemesh, Modi’in, Netanya, Ra’anana, and Herzliya,' says Katz. 'Tel Aviv has always been a popular destination because it has everything, but there are also interesting trends in other cities.' Unexpected Hotspots: New Areas Gaining Popularity Among Overseas Buyers One of the biggest surprises in recent years has been the rising demand for properties in Carmei Gat. 'This area has gained significant traction over the past year and a half,' says Katz. 'There are already about 200 Anglo families living there, largely due to the efforts of a modern Orthodox leader who established a synagogue and attracted young families. Once a community is established, more people naturally want to join.' Even in the private housing sector, there are noteworthy trends, though on a smaller scale. 'Near Beit Shemesh, for example, there’s a neighborhood called Giv’ot Eden, where dozens of private homes have been purchased by overseas buyers,' says Katz. 'In some places, you can actually see communities organizing purchases together to maintain their familiar way of life.' The Bureaucratic Challenges of Buying Property from Abroad and How the Expo Helps Purchasing a home in Israel as a foreign resident involves significant bureaucratic challenges, and the expo is designed to provide buyers with direct and targeted assistance. 'The bureaucracy issue has two main aspects,' explains Gidon Katz. 'On one hand, there are the standard procedures—things like purchasing processes, consular paperwork, and official approvals. On the other hand, there's the issue of dealing with foreign currency. Even though we are all brothers, financial transactions with Israeli banks operate under different regulations.' For this reason, the expo includes professionals who specialize in the purchasing process for foreign buyers. 'There are lawyers, mortgage advisors, and financial transfer experts available at the event to provide guidance,' says Katz. Jewish Communities and Group Purchases: Real Estate as a Continuation of Community Life For many buyers, purchasing property in Israel is not just a financial investment but also a way to preserve their communal ties and Jewish identity. 'The concept of community among Jews abroad extends far beyond religion,' explains Gidon Katz. 'In the United States, for example, the average Jewish individual belongs to a synagogue—whether they attend daily, only on Shabbat, or just on holidays. The community plays a central role in daily life.' A growing trend in recent years is the collective purchase of properties by organized communities looking to settle in the same area. 'At least two communities have done this,' Katz shares. 'For example, the Persian Jewish community from Great Neck, Long Island, collectively purchased 60 apartments in Kiryat Ono as part of a communal initiative. By securing a project together, they also gained leverage to negotiate for benefits like a dedicated community center.' Types of Properties in Demand and Buying Trends Among Jews Abroad The vast majority of real estate transactions among Jews in the diaspora involve newly built apartments, though there are also cases of purchasing private homes or second-hand properties. 'More than 90% of transactions involve new apartments,' notes Gidon Katz. 'There is demand for private homes as well, but it remains a smaller portion, similar to trends among Israeli buyers.' A particularly interesting trend is the demand for apartments in projects that will be completed in several years. 'Many buyers are planning to make Aliyah, but not immediately,' says Katz. 'For example, a parent whose child is currently in 11th grade may not want to relocate right away and disrupt their education. Instead, they purchase an apartment that will be ready in three years—just as their child finishes high school.' The Expo Expands: Number of Events Surges Due to Growing Demand The success of the expo and the increasing demand from potential buyers have led to a significant expansion in the number of events in recent years. 'Five years ago, we held just two real estate expos a year, in one or maybe two locations,' says Gidon Katz. 'Last year was exceptional—we hosted 18 different events, and this year we anticipate between 15 and 20.' The growth in the number of expos not only reflects demand but also provides buyers in more locations with direct access to information and investment opportunities. 'In the past, we primarily held events in March and September,' Katz explains. 'But due to rising interest, in the past two years, we’ve also added events in May and November. As long as we continue to see strong engagement, we’ll keep expanding and reaching new audiences.' Economic Opportunities: Pre-Sale Prices and Flexible Payment Terms One of the main advantages of the expo is the opportunity to purchase apartments during the pre-sale ('presale') stage, when prices are significantly lower than their final market value. 'Several projects are launching their sales specifically at the expo,' explains Gidon Katz. 'In such cases, the sale takes place at pre-sale prices, which means that only the first 10% to 20% of the apartments are available at this discounted rate—this is the limit set by the banks.' In addition to discounted property prices, the expo also offers financing plans tailored for foreign buyers. 'There are 10-90 and 20-80 payment models,' Katz notes, referring to structures in which buyers pay an initial deposit of 10% or 20% and the remaining balance later, based on the progress of construction. Making Decisions on the Spot: How the Buying Process Works at the Expo The expo is designed to provide participants with all the necessary information to make informed and timely decisions. 'If someone has always dreamed of living in Givat Shmuel and suddenly sees a pre-sale project there, they might decide to secure a unit on the spot,' explains Gidon Katz. 'They know that within two weeks, the price could go up by 200,000 shekels, so they take action immediately.' Although full transactions cannot be completed at the expo due to legal restrictions, buyers can reserve apartments on-site. 'Participants can place a deposit to secure their property, and legal advisors are available to guide them through the process,' Katz adds. The Upcoming Expos: Locations and Dates Not all attendees make immediate purchasing decisions—many come to gather information, compare options, and return home with a clearer understanding of their possibilities. 'Not everyone buys on the spot, and that’s perfectly fine,' says Katz. 'Some people attend to explore opportunities, conduct comparisons, and refine their choices before making a final decision.' The upcoming expos will take place in Toronto (March 20), Lakewood (March 23), Teaneck (March 24), and the Five Towns area of Long Island (March 26). 'These are key locations where we see the greatest interest from overseas buyers, which is why we chose to host events there,' Katz concludes. Participation is free with registration.

Dozens killed in US strikes on Houthi targets across Yemen: 'They...	Houthis say 31 killed in US airstrikes, with reports number could rise; strikes target Houthi leadership and send warning to Iran amid rising tensions between Washington and Tehran; Houthis claim 'devastating attacks' left over 100 wounded U.S. airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen continued overnight Sunday with significant intensity, striking multiple locations across the country. The Iran-backed terrorist group said at least 31 people were killed and 101 wounded, mostly women and children, though the claims could not be independently verified. The wave of strikes follows President Donald Trump’s decision to launch a large-scale military campaign against the Houthis, marking the opening phase of a broader U.S. offensive against the rebel group, which has resumed threats against Israel and international shipping in the Red Sea. According to reports, the strikes targeted Bayda province in southern Yemen, Dhamar province, Saada province in the north, Hajjah province in the west and multiple locations in the capital, Sanaa. Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese network Al Mayadeen reported 39 killed in Sanaa and Saada, warning the toll could rise. Six senior Houthi leaders were reportedly among those killed. 'The attacks were devastating,' a source in Sanaa said. 'They were everywhere and the casualties are civilians.' According to The Wall Street Journal, officials briefed by the Trump administration said the operation has three primary objectives: Destroying Houthi missile launchers targeting ships in the Red Sea, eliminating key Houthi leadership figures in hiding and sending a warning to Iran, with a message that it could be next. > The report said U.S. airstrikes hit military installations and homes of Houthi leaders in Sanaa, as well as missile launch sites positioned along the coast in preparation for new attacks on shipping lanes. The Houthis’ Supreme Political Council released a statement condemning the 'reckless U.S.-Israeli aggression', calling on the international community to intervene. The group vowed to continue maritime operations in the Red Sea until Israel lifts its blockade on Gaza and allows humanitarian aid in. The Saudi-owned Al Arabiya network reported that U.S. strikes hit Houthi military sites in six different Yemeni provinces. The escalation forced Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi to cancel his daily Ramadan speech. Senior Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti told Al Mayadeen: 'The U.S. strikes are unjustified because our actions are directed solely at Israel. Our response is coming. For us, there is no difference between Trump and Biden—we will not abandon our support for Palestine.' The Houthi-run Health Ministry in Sanaa told Qatar’s Al Araby that medical teams were still treating wounded victims and searching for survivors under the rubble. The ministry warned that nine years of war have crippled Yemen’s health sector, with 45% of facilities non-operational. 'Trump has made the biggest strategic mistake in U.S. history—the consequences will be severe,' the ministry said. Trump, who has blamed Iran for supporting the Houthis’ attacks on Red Sea shipping, warned Tehran to halt its backing of the group immediately. 'Support for the Houthi terrorists must end IMMEDIATELY!' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'Do NOT threaten the American People, their President, who has received one of the largest mandates in Presidential History, or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won’t be nice about it!' U.S. officials told Reuters that airstrikes could last for several days, possibly weeks, and could escalate depending on the Houthis’ response. The New York Times reported that some White House advisers are pushing for even more aggressive strikes, aiming to force the Houthis to relinquish large parts of the territory they control in northern Yemen. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk3nlx4hjg	2025-03-15T23:23:20-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/16/ByjoM1V31e/ByjoM1V31e_0_178_1055_594_0_small.jpg

Israeli hostage Tal Shoham: ‘Hamas paraded me, threatened me, but...	Tal Shoham describes brutal conditions in captivity, including starvation, psychological abuse, and being held in dark, airless tunnel; struggling to maintain humanity, he imagined his family’s funeral to cope, and vowed not to let captors break him For 505 days, Tal Shoham lived in darkness, isolation, and extreme deprivation, held captive by Hamas in Gaza’s underground tunnel network. Now, in his first interview since being freed, he is revealing the physical and psychological torment he endured—alongside his refusal to break. Shoham, 40, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7, when Hamas launched a deadly assault on Israeli communities near the Gaza border. He was dragged from his car by armed terrorists, paraded through crowds in Gaza, and ultimately confined to a small underground cell with three other hostages. 'I refused to kneel,' he said. 'I told them, whether in Hebrew or Arabic, I don’t even remember—I will not go down on my knees. They could kill me, but it would be on my terms.' After being seized, Shoham was forced through Gaza’s streets, where civilians surrounded him. Some threw objects, while others beat him with sticks. 'The crowd was in a frenzy,' he said. 'They screamed, ‘Zionist pig!’ and called me a soldier, even though I wasn’t.' Shoham refused to show fear. 'I just waved and smiled. I thought, ‘You caught me, but you won’t see fear in my eyes.’' He was then moved between several locations before being taken to a 5.5-square-meter underground room, where he was held with three other hostages. The cell had no light and very little air. Life in captivity: starvation and isolation For the first 34 days, Shoham was held alone, bound, in a private home in Gaza. He received just a few spoonfuls of avocado, three dates, or half an orange each day. But hunger was not the worst part—uncertainty about his family’s fate was. 'I had to assume they were all dead,' he said. 'I sat on the floor and imagined their funeral—one large grave for my wife, two smaller ones for my children. I gave a eulogy in my head, thanking them for the time we had together.' Later, he was transferred to a Hamas tunnel, where conditions worsened. He was given just 300 milliliters of water a day—barely enough to drink, let alone wash. Meals consisted only of rice, and captors often withheld food as punishment. > 'After weeks without real food, my body started to shut down,' he said. 'I lost 29 kilograms. My leg became severely infected, turning blue, yellow, and purple due to internal bleeding.' Medical care was almost nonexistent, though Hamas gave the hostages blood thinners to prevent deadly clots from prolonged inactivity. Later, they received a week’s worth of vitamin supplements. 'It tasted like dog food,' Shoham said. 'But it kept us alive.' Torture and psychological abuse Shoham and his fellow hostages were subjected to routine beatings. At times, their guards forced them to crawl like dogs, laughing as they struck them. 'One of them would scream at us, calling us ‘filthy Jews’ while hitting us, and then 10 minutes later, he’d smile and hand us food,' Shoham recalled. Throughout it all, he remained defiant. 'I refused to give them what they wanted. I wouldn’t break.' On the 50th day, Shoham was handed a note from his wife, confirming that she and their children had survived and been freed. 'My hands were shaking as I read it,' he said. 'That was the most important moment. My family was safe. I no longer had to worry about protecting them. Now, I could focus on my own fight to survive.' 'That's dew' After nearly 18 months underground, Shoham was blindfolded and led outside as part of a November 2023 hostage deal. As he stepped forward, he suddenly felt something wet on his face. 'Is that rain?' he asked. One of his Hamas captors laughed. 'No,' he said. 'That’s dew.' Shoham ignored the taunt. 'At that moment, I didn’t care,' he said. 'I was going home.' Shoham was taken to an Israeli military base, where he reunited with his wife and children. 'It felt like a dream,' he said. 'Even now, it still doesn’t feel real.' But joy quickly turned to grief. Shoham learned that 11 of his relatives had been killed or kidnapped on October 7. Some had been released, while others had not survived. Despite his losses, Shoham held onto one thing Hamas could not take from him—his humanity. 'Between us, the Jewish hostages, there was respect, dignity, and purity,' he said. 'Hamas tried to strip us of our humanity, to force their cruelty onto us. But in our space, we refused to let them win. 'And that was the key to making it out whole.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sypfojnnjl	2025-03-15T22:34:08-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/22/rkeYoVvcyl/rkeYoVvcyl_0_174_2506_1411_0_small.jpg
Over 2,000 killers are still out there': Arab Israelis plead for...	Deadly crime wave grips Israel’s Arab sector, with 51 murdered since January; Adam Halaila shot dead in Dir Hanna, his cousin critically wounded; Mahmoud Jabarin killed in Umm al-Fahm before his wedding; 'No revenge—I forgive,' his father says The wave of violence in Israel’s Arab community continues to claim lives, with the number of people killed rising to 51 since the beginning of the year—less than four months in. So far, only three of the cases have been solved. On Sunday morning, a 27-year-old man was shot and killed in the town of Yafia, near Nazareth. Emergency responders arrived at the scene and attempted to treat him but had to pronounce him dead. Police said the killing was criminally motivated, launched an investigation and began searching for suspects. On Friday night, Adam Halaila, a man in his early 20s, was shot dead in Dir Hanna, northern Israel, in front of women and children. His cousin, Hassan, was also shot at point-blank range while sitting in his car and remains in critical condition. Halaila was ambushed by a masked gunman while entering a local grocery store, witnesses said. 'It was horrifying. When the shooting started, I dropped to the ground, fearing for my life,' local resident Amal Arabi told Ynet. 'It’s a miracle we survived.' Arabi said the killing was part of an ongoing pattern of unchecked violence. 'If you do the math, nearly 550 people have been murdered in Arab communities in recent years. Each attack involves at least two or three perpetrators. That means over 2,000 killers are still out there, murdering without consequences. Instead of eliminating crime, the police are just managing it.' A local woman, who was at the scene with her two children, described running for cover. 'We saw what was happening and ran. My kids were crying in fear. We hid inside a shop until the gunmen left,' she said. 'These criminals don’t care about anyone. Even if my child had been killed, it wouldn’t have mattered to them.' Two days earlier, 32-year-old Mahmoud Jabarin of Umm al-Fahm was shot dead while preparing falafel ahead of Ramadan’s evening fast-breaking meal. His father, Jasub, witnessed the killing. > 'Every Ramadan, I set up a table and sell falafel. My son was helping me when a masked man arrived and shot him nine times,' he told Ynet. 'He was murdered in front of me, in front of everyone. That night, we were supposed to hold a reconciliation meeting to resolve a dispute, but just hours before, my son was killed. My heart is shattered. He was engaged and set to be married in six months.' Last week, another victim, Khaled Ghanem from Zemer, was murdered. His father, Jamal, condemned the cycle of revenge killings. 'I lost my dear son, who was a good man,' he told Ynet. 'But I forgive, and I do not want revenge. I lost one person, and I do not want to lose more. Anyone who commits violence in our name—we are not responsible for them.' Ghanem warned that the violence has become routine. 'At this rate, every family will lose a son or daughter because no one is stopping this epidemic that is stealing our children from us,' he said. 'In the past, if a business was shot at, the whole town would rise up. Today, innocent people are being killed, and there’s no response. It has become normal.' Police Commissioner Dani Levi vowed Tuesday to intensify efforts to crack down on organized crime in the country’s Arab sector, declaring that law enforcement will aggressively target criminals and their financial assets. 'When I took office, I called on criminals to change their ways. Some thought it was a joke. They didn’t realize I’m a dyed-in-the-wool police officer—I don’t joke,' he said at a Ramadan gathering of northern industrial leaders in Nazareth. Referring to a recent police operation against the notorious Abu Latif crime family, Levi said: 'We told them to change their ways. They didn’t, so we arrested them all and seized their equipment, their cars and every shekel they took from the state. We will take it all back.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1011wk4nje	2025-03-15T22:12:28-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/15/SyLCnmmhJx/SyLCnmmhJx_0_104_480_271_0_small.jpg
IDF identifies 6 terrorists killed in northern Gaza strike, inclu...	Military says killed terrorist cell in Beit Lahia using drone to facilitate attacks on troops; IDF says one terrorist involved in October 7 attack, others posed as journalists and one freed in latest hostage deal The IDF said early Sunday that it carried out an airstrike targeting a terrorist cell in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, killing several operatives, including one who infiltrated Israel during the October 7 Hamas-led attack. Some of those killed had been operating under the guise of journalists, according to the military. According to a statement, the terrorists were operating a drone intended to facilitate attacks against Israeli troops operating in Gaza and that the drone had been in continuous use by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). The strike follows Palestinian reports that nine people were killed in the attack. The IDF named the terrorists killed in the strike as Mostafa Mohammed Shaaban Hamad, a Hamas operative who infiltrated Israel on October 7; Mahmoud Yahya Rashdi Al-Sarraj, a Hamas engineering operative; Bilal Mahmoud Fouad Abu Matar, a Hamas terrorist who operated under the guise of a photographer; Mahmoud Imad Hassan Aslim, a member of Hamas' Zaytoun Battalion, also posing as a journalist; Suhaib Bassem Khaled Nagar, a PIJ terrorist released in the most recent hostage deal; and Hamas operative Mohammed Alaa Sobhi Al-Jafeer. 'The IDF will continue to operate to remove any threat to the citizens of the State of Israel and IDF troops,' the military said in its statement. > The IDF said the strike was carried out in two phases. First, two terrorists operating the drone were identified and attacked. Then, as additional terrorists moved in to recover the drone equipment and entered a vehicle, the IDF struck them as well. The Palestinian health ministry said several people were wounded in the strike, some critically, and were taken to the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza. Palestinian sources claimed that the drone was being used to document the distribution of humanitarian aid to civilians. Hamas' Gaza-based media office echoed the claim, telling AFP that the operatives had been filming 'a large table set for the Ramadan iftar meal' (the fast-breaking meal). Hamas said the individuals were attacked despite their 'clear professional role.' Roughly an hour before the Beit Lahia strike, the IDF said it targeted three terrorists near Israeli forces in central Gaza's Netzarim corridor as they attempted to plant explosives. In recent days, amid a fragile cease-fire, the IDF has reported multiple strikes targeting terrorists attempting to plant roadside bombs or engaging in what it described as 'suspicious activity' near its forces, most of whom were eliminated in airstrikes. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk1qgjehje	2025-03-15T21:35:26-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/16/Bk8vzkV2kg/Bk8vzkV2kg_0_0_1600_900_0_small.jpg

Washington admits Hamas talks backfired—now a secret deadline loo...	As Hamas refuses to release more than one live hostage, US now views past negotiations as a mistake; Witkoff sets secret deadline, while mediators propose deal for 11 live hostages, 16 bodies and cease-fire extension; Netanyahu weighs military action Hamas has refused to budge on its latest offer to release only one live hostage, Israeli American citizen Edan Alexander, along with the remains of four other captives with dual citizenship, while the U.S. has issued an unspecified deadline, warning of consequences if the group does not agree to a broader deal. Israel, meanwhile, is awaiting Hamas’ response to a renewed proposal calling for the release of 11 live hostages and 16 bodies, in exchange for a 40-day cease-fire extension through Ramadan and Passover. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has convened an emergency meeting Saturday evening to discuss the stalled negotiations, receiving a briefing from the delegation that returned from Doha. The discussion will also include possible military responses, ranging from targeted operations to a broader offensive, should talks collapse entirely. U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff rejected Hamas’ latest offer, saying that while the group projects 'flexibility' publicly, it continues to demand terms that require a permanent cease-fire, which Washington considers 'impractical.' Witkoff had presented Hamas with a bridging proposal on Wednesday in Qatar, aiming to extend the cease-fire to allow further negotiations for a long-term truce. 'Under the proposed framework, Hamas would release live hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, following previous exchange formulas. The initial cease-fire extension would enable expanded humanitarian aid, while the U.S. would work toward a broader resolution,' the statement said. Witkoff also delivered a stark warning to Hamas, imposing a deadline without revealing the exact timeframe. 'Hamas is making a very bad bet that time is on its side. It is not. Hamas is well aware of the deadline, and should know that we will respond accordingly if that deadline passes,' he cautioned. His warning aligns with President Donald Trump’s repeated threats to allow Israel to resume full-scale military operations if negotiations fail. However, Witkoff has reportedly urged Israel to hold off on military action as long as talks continue, indicating that the deadline is likely a matter of days rather than weeks. U.S. officials now appear to be more aligned with Netanyahu's position, recognizing that previous direct negotiations between Hamas and Trump's special envoy for hostage affairs, Adam Boehler, may have inadvertently backfired. Washington officials reportedly acknowledge that Boehler’s efforts created an impression within Hamas that gaps existed between U.S. and Israeli positions—an assumption the terror group sought to exploit. The realization has led to a shift in Washington’s approach, with officials admitting they acted contrary to their own strategic interests, engaging in talks that even the Biden administration had avoided. Boehler’s discussions with Hamas had focused on securing the release of Edan Alexander and four deceased hostages with American citizenship. Hamas’ latest proposal largely reiterates those terms, despite the fact that the framework was no longer being considered. Earlier this week, Boehler was removed from his role, with the White House citing a conflict of interest related to his business dealings—though the timing of his departure suggests broader dissatisfaction with his efforts. With a Hamas delegation currently in Cairo, Israel has put forward a renewed proposal via mediators, calling for the release of 11 live hostages and 16 fallen captives, alongside a cease-fire extension of approximately 40 days, lasting through the end of Passover. > While officially presented as a mediator-led initiative, the proposal was largely formulated by Witkoff and closely resembles his original framework: an initial release of half of the remaining live hostages and bodies, a cease-fire extension and the release of the second half contingent on an agreement for a permanent truce. The decision to revert to this broader framework is likely a response to Hamas’ rejection of more limited deals. However, Hamas previously dismissed this proposal and later pushed for a significantly reduced exchange—seeking the release of only about five live hostages—raising doubts about whether the group will accept the renewed terms. Hamas reportedly views the proposed 40-day cease-fire extension as a joint Israeli-American maneuver to buy time and has insisted on clear U.S. guarantees for an eventual end to the war. Amid the deadlock, growing frustration is emerging among hostage families, who have criticized the mediators' proposal as a 'salami slicing tactic,' in which hostages are released in small groups rather than all at once. They continue to demand a deal that secures the return of all hostages in a single exchange. With negotiations at a standstill, concerns are mounting that military action may be the only remaining option. This issue is set to be a central focus in Netanyahu’s security meeting, which will include ministers Israel Katz, Gideon Sa’ar, Bezalel Smotrich, Ron Dermer and Shas leader Aryeh Deri, alongside top security officials, including Mossad Director David Barnea, Shin Bet head Ronen Bar, Maj. Gen. (res.) Nitzan Alon and IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi. Discussions are expected to explore various military responses, from a phased return to combat and pinpoint operations to a large-scale ground maneuver, should Hamas continue to reject negotiated solutions. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1ogvi72kl	2025-03-15T11:47:25-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/24/Hyy8hLc5kx/Hyy8hLc5kx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

At least nine people were killed and nine others injured in U.S. airstrikes on the Houthi stronghold of Sanaa, Yemen’s Health Ministry said in an initial report Saturday.

Trump criticized his predecessor Joe Biden’s handling of Houthi aggression, calling it 'pathetically weak,' and issued a direct warning to the Iran-backed terrorist group: 'Your time is up, and your attacks must stop, starting today. If they don't, hell will rain down upon you like nothing you have ever seen before.' The president also addressed Iran, demanding an immediate end to its support for the Houthis. 'Do not threaten the American people,' he warned.

At least 9 killed as US launches major air and sea strikes on Houthi targets, aiming to restore Red Sea shipping security; Trump warns Houthis to halt attacks or face 'overwhelming lethal force' and issues stark warning to Iran to end its support for them The United States launched a large-scale military operation Saturday evening, striking dozens of Houthi targets in Sanaa and Hodeidah, The New York Times reported, citing two senior U.S. officials. The strikes, described as the 'starting point' of a broader offensive against the Iran-backed group, come as the Houthis have resumed threats against Israel and international shipping in the Red Sea. According to U.S. officials, the strikes targeted radars, air defense systems and missile sites, with the Trump administration aiming to reopen key international shipping routes in the Red Sea. They described the operation as the most significant military action of Trump’s second term, intended not only to weaken the Houthis but also to send a direct warning to Iran. Yemen’s Health Ministry said in an initial report that at least nine people were killed and nine others injured in the strikes on Sanaa. Reports in the U.S. indicate that the strikes, aimed at the Houthis’ vast weapons arsenal—some of it buried underground—'could last several days and escalate depending on the militants' response.' The New York Times also noted divisions within the U.S. National Security Council, where some advisers are pushing for even more aggressive strikes to force the Houthis to cede control of large parts of northern Yemen. Senior Houthi official Nasruddin Amer responded to the U.S. operation on X, writing: 'Sanaa will remain Gaza’s shield and support, and will not abandon it, no matter the challenges.' Meanwhile, President Donald Trump issued a forceful statement following the strikes, declaring that U.S. forces had launched 'decisive and powerful' action against the Houthis. 'They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American and other ships, aircraft, and drones,' Trump said. Criticizing his predecessor, Trump added, 'Joe Biden’s response was pathetically weak, so the unrestrained Houthis just kept going. It has been over a year since a U.S.-flagged commercial ship safely sailed through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, or the Gulf of Aden. The last American warship to go through the Red Sea, four months ago, was attacked by the Houthis over a dozen times.' Trump accused Iran of financing the Houthis, saying the group had launched missiles at U.S. aircraft and targeted American troops and allies. 'These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and the global economy billions of dollars while putting innocent lives at risk,' he said. Trump to Houthis and Iran: ‘Your time is up’ Trump issued a direct ultimatum to the Houthis, declaring: 'Your time is up, and your attacks must stop, starting today. If they don’t, hell will rain down upon you like nothing you have ever seen before!' He also addressed Iran, demanding an immediate end to its support for the Houthis. 'Do NOT threaten the American people, their president, who has received one of the largest mandates in presidential history, or worldwide shipping lanes,' he warned. 'If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable—and we won’t be nice about it!' > Trump reiterated that the U.S. would no longer tolerate Houthi attacks on American vessels. 'We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective,' he said. 'The Houthis have choked off one of the most important waterways in the world, halted vast swaths of global trade, and attacked the core principle of Freedom of Navigation, upon which international commerce depends.' He concluded by praising U.S. forces: 'Our brave warfighters are now striking terrorist bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American ships and restore navigational freedom. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the waterways of the world.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1agarq2kl	2025-03-15T11:08:26-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/15/HJ4T3Bm31e/HJ4T3Bm31e_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Hamas captivity survivor Omer Shem Tov details in video his time in captivity and urges swift action to free 59 remaining hostages; held alone in tunnels for over a year, he warns they are being broken and calls on Israel’s government to act now A video of Hamas captivity survivor Omer Shem Tov describing his harrowing experience in Hamas captivity was released Saturday evening as part of a campaign urging the release of the 59 remaining hostages held in Gaza for 526 days. 'I was alone for 450 days—it’s a terrible feeling,' Shem Tov says in the video. 'There are still so many people there, alone. Every day feels like an eternity. I know exactly what they’re going through. It felt like our souls were being murdered. This has to stop as soon as possible.' Shem Tov was initially held with fellow hostage Itay Regev, who was released in the first hostage deal in November 2023. Afterward, he was held alone in Hamas tunnels for over a year. The video was released exactly three weeks since Shem Tov was freed in the final phase of the first hostage deal. The 22-year-old from Herzliya has repeatedly called for immediate action to rescue those still held in Gaza, testifying to the horrors he endured in captivity. > Addressing the Israeli government, Shem Tov pleaded for decisive action. 'This can’t continue in drips and drops, this torture,' he said. 'I don’t know if you understand, but they are being broken. You reach a point where you survive on crumbs, eating almost nothing. Everyone wants to defeat this terrible enemy, but priorities must be set—hostages must come first.' Shem Tov also described the impact of IDF operations near his place of captivity. 'When the military is close by, it changes everything,' he said. 'The IDF is doing sacred work, every soldier is a hero, but the military pressure makes it even harder. Above ground, there were terrible explosions. When I was taken underground into the tunnel, I still felt the blasts—like earthquakes. I could hear the tanks rolling above me. I heard the soldiers, and the terrorists were already holding their weapons, armed and ready, just waiting for the soldiers to come. They stood next to me while I sat on a mattress and prayed. At that moment, I told myself—this is out of my hands. I have no control, so all I could do was sit, pray and hope for the best.' He ended with a direct appeal to Israel’s leadership: 'It’s time for the Israeli government to take charge and make a decision to bring everyone home—at once, not in drips, not in deals stretching over 50 days. It’s time to bring them all back in one move. Am Yisrael Chai! I love you all so much. I came back thanks to you, but the mission isn’t over. I will do everything to bring the hostages home as soon as possible. Let’s fight for this together. Am Yisrael Chai—we are united and strong!' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj9f7rmnjx	2025-03-15T10:30:13-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/15/By7Z5N72kl/By7Z5N72kl_46_0_1153_649_0_small.jpg

Defense Minister Israel Katz on Saturday criticized the military’s plan to issue 14,000 additional draft orders to ultra-Orthodox men by May, arguing that unilateral measures have failed in the past. 'The principles of the draft law I presented to the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee are based on two key pillars: setting clear recruitment targets for significant military service among the ultra-Orthodox community—along with clear sanctions for failing to meet them—while also preserving and protecting the Jewish Torah world, which is fundamental to our existence as a Jewish state,' Katz wrote. He warned that previous attempts, including issuing draft orders without broader agreement, had failed, resulting in a reality where only a small percentage of ultra-Orthodox men serve in the military.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1iq6eqnjg	2025-03-15T09:50:01-07:00

After Sinwar, Hamas led by committe including a shadow figure and...	Members include Khaled Mashal, Khalil al-Hayya, Zaher Jabarin, Mohammed Darwish, and Nizar Awadallah while Sinwar's brother Mohammed is the military chief; Hamas preserves its organizational structure, operational capabilities During the war in Gaza and as key figures in Hamas were assassinated, including its political bureau chief, Ismail Haniyeh, the terror group established a temporary five-member leadership committee made up of Khaled Mashal, Khalil al-Hayya, Zaher Jabarin, Mohammed Darwish, and Nizar Awadallah, whose name was initially withheld for security reasons. After the killing of Yahya Sinwar in October 2024, the committee decided to lead Hamas until leadership elections, originally scheduled for March, though their status remains uncertain. Sources in Gaza suggest Hamas may elect a leader from outside the enclave. According to reports in Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat, Nizar Awadallah plays a key role in the negotiations, particularly those surrounding hostage deals and a cease-fire. Sources told the Saudi outlet that Awadallah is, in fact the shadow figure in the talks, although Khalil al Haya, who is the Hamas leader in Gaza, is a more prominent figure and the public face in the negotiations. Hamas has not said publicly who is participating in the talks and negotiating on its behalf. Awadallah competed against Yahya Sinwar for the leadership of the group in the last elections which were close and enjoys popularity among its members. The Symbolic figure and the point man for Iran Mohammed Ismail Darwish, also known as Abu Omar Hassan, leads Hamas's Shura Council and the political delegations to countries such as Turkey and Iran. He is a unifying figure but is not considered 'leadership material' because he is seen as uncharismatic and unable to raise public enthusiasm. Khaled Mashal who was not close to Sinwar is not thought to have much sway in the organization. Zaher Jabarin oversees the group’s finances and serves as the point man for contact with Iran, the Hamas's key financial backer. He is also responsible for the terror group's activity in the West Bank and served as deputy to Saleh Al Arouri, who was assassinated in Beirut last year. Khalil al-Hayya, a close ally of Sinwar, has taken a dominant role in the terror group's political affairs and cease-fire talks. His strong ties to Sinwar’s brother, Mohammed Sinwar, further solidify his influence within the organization. Mohammed Sinwar now commands Hamas’s military wing in Gaza, overseeing the group’s remaining hostages and restructuring its forces. Another key military figure is Ezz al-Din Haddad, known as the ghost of Al Kassam, a high-ranking member who commands Gaza City and is a member of the military council. He has at least six brigades under his command, including the Nukhba forces who committed the massacre on October 7. He has survived multiple assassination attempts. > According to an investigative report in the Qatari based Al Jazeera network, Haddad gathered the commanders of the Hamas brigades for a secret meeting a day before the massacre to give them the orders. He told them their mission was to abduct as many IDF soldiers as possible in the first moments of the attack and send them back to Gaza and to take control of the communities along the border, while filming their actions Despite significant losses, Hamas continues to govern Gaza and maintain its military operations. According to a recent AP report, Hamas has preserved its organizational structure and operational capabilities, including the distribution of humanitarian aid. Sources in Gaza claim that Mohammed Sinwar has ordered rapid recruitment efforts, with the group still commanding around 20,000 fighters. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy9rnem2ye	2025-03-15T04:52:39-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/15/BygSOJ7nke/BygSOJ7nke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

If the talks do not advance, the channel said, the president may greenlight IDF action across the border. Talks between Israeli and Lebanese military teams under the auspices of the United States and France began in Naqoura earlier this month and aim to reach an agreement on the Blue Line, marking the international border between the two countries. > Israeli officials said they hoped the talks would lead to normalization of ties between Jerusalem and Beirut, a possibility that Lebanese President Joseph Aoun denied. After the cease-fire agreement that ended the war with Hezbollah, Israel withdrew most of its forces but maintained a military presence in five strategic points in South Lebanon to prevent the return of Hezbollah terrorists to the area. The IDF has also continued to attack Hezbollah targets in the Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon, most recently targeting weapons production and storage facilities and along the Lebanese border with Syria to prevent the smuggling of arms to the terror group. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1qiyy72kg	2025-03-15T04:00:02-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/12/SJproxyn1g/SJproxyn1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Gaza cease-fire holds despite weeks since last hostage release	Netanyahu to convene security assessment while negotiations in Doha continue with no breakthrough; officials warn Hamas rebuilding military capabilities and increasing hold on Gaza civilians Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will convene a security assessment on Saturday, exactly two weeks since the last release of Israeli hostages from Hamas captivity, ending the first phase of the cease-fire agreement in Gaza. Negotiations to free the rest of the hostages or enter the second phase of the deal are stalled and the truce in the fighting continued despite the promise by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the cease-fire would end if hostages were not released. U.S. President Donald Trump said late on Friday that he was hopeful that an agreement would be reached. It’s a complicated situation, he said. Israel has allowed the cease-fire to continue while its leverage over Hamas has diminished and the terror group has been rebuilding its strength and its hold on the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu announced on March 1st, after 33 Israeli captives were freed, that he was halting humanitarian aid supplies to Gaza. 'If Hamas continues its refusal to release more hostages and accept the outline proposed by Steve Witkoff, there would be more consequences,' Netanyahu said at the time. In the 42 days while the first phase of the deal was underway, Hamas filled its stores with aid brought into the Strip in over 25,000 trucks including 50 carrying fuel and gas. Israeli officials said Hamas has enough supplies to last for at least four months. According to the security officials, the ongoing truce has enabled Hamas to regroup and prepare for renewed fighting. 'They are preparing as we are,' the officials said. 'Their hold on the civilian population is also increasing daily. We've closed the borders but did not destroy their supply storages.' Hamas is still holding 59 Israeli hostages - 24 are officially said to be alive, although that number could be smaller. Witkoff's latest proposal which was being discussed in the negotiations in Qatar was for a limited release of up to 5 hostages in exchange for 50 days of truce.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byuk7hm21l	2025-03-15T00:07:58-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/12/rJQUHnhAoyl/rJQUHnhAoyl_0_0_1920_1080_0_small.jpg
Another round of fighting in Gaza is inevitable, says INSS expert	Prof. Kobi Michael said the hope is that the next round of fighting will be shorter and more effective The gaps between Hamas and Israel are irreconcilable, so Israel is likely to find itself in another round of fighting in Gaza, according to Prof. Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at INSS. He told ILTV News that the hope is for the second round to be 'much shorter' and 'more effective.'

Mahmoud Khalil’s arrest sparks debate: Terror support or First Am...	Comment: Khalil is being detained because he violated the terms of his green card Americans on the left and right are divided over the controversial detainment of pro-Hamas activist and Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil. While some argue this is a necessary step to enforce the law and stop terror support on American campuses, others are questioning the limits of free expression—a constitutionally protected right. While asking questions is valid, those who defend this man as some kind of martyr are entirely missing the point. First, Khalil isn’t being detained because of anything he said; he is being detained because he violated the terms of his green card. When you accept a green card, you pledge not to support U.S.-designated terrorist organizations—of which Hamas and Hezbollah explicitly are. The United States is under no obligation to provide non-citizens with visas or green cards and is well within its sovereign rights to revoke any that have already been issued. This is not new, not racist, and not unique to the United States. Second, beyond deportation, Khalil’s alleged behavior is also of criminal concern. He has been accused of leading the Columbia University protests in which Jewish students were violently assaulted, Columbia staff were held hostage in a building illegally taken over by Hamas-supporting mobs, and students chanted in support of U.S.-designated terror groups: Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis—all while U.S. citizens remain hostages. Khalil reportedly also distributed flyers from Hamas’s media office. And let’s not forget: Hamas actually praised the student protests, stating they worked in their favor during hostage negotiations. Now, let’s talk legality. Under the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act (8 USC 1182), any non-citizen who 'endorses or espouses terrorist activity or persuades others to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization' is inadmissible to the United States. Legal precedent also confirms that, even under a free speech analysis, which requires the test of 'strict scrutiny' in America, the U.S. is well within its rights to act against Khalil. There is a compelling national interest—a precedent established in Morse v. Frederick and Turner v. Williams. Finally, the glorification of terror supporters, even by elected officials, makes a mockery of the legal system and the U.S. Congress—no one on the left or right should be doing this. These laws exist to protect all American citizens. Khalil came to this country seeking citizenship and used the opportunity to foment hatred against America. He is not a victim, and his rights are not being violated. He was the leader of a movement that, according to U.S. intelligence, has been funded by the Islamic Republic of Iran and has promoted multiple U.S.-designated terrorist organizations. The United States is under no legal obligation to permit him to stay in the country.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj5giighke	2025-03-14T23:26:58-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/10/SJzoA2nokl/SJzoA2nokl_0_175_686_387_0_small.jpg
Washington cracks down on Iran-linked crime syndicate	The organization's leader, Rawa Majid, is known as 'The Kurdish Fox' The United States has imposed sanctions on the Foxtrot Network, a powerful transnational criminal organization based in Sweden, and its leader, Rawa Majid, known as 'The Kurdish Fox.' This crime network, involved in drug trafficking and arms smuggling, has been linked to attacks on Israeli and Jewish targets across Europe—allegedly orchestrated by the Iranian regime. The most alarming incident occurred on January 31, 2024, when Swedish authorities thwarted an attempted attack on the Israeli embassy in Stockholm. A live grenade was found outside the embassy and was safely detonated by the national bomb squad. Israeli intelligence agency Mossad and the Swedish Security Service confirmed that the Foxtrot Network carried out the attack under Iranian directives. The violence didn’t stop there. Four months later, shots were fired near the Israeli embassy in Stockholm, and airsoft grenades were thrown into the Israeli embassy yard in Belgium. According to the U.S. government, Iran’s use of criminal organizations like Foxtrot demonstrates its willingness to pursue its goals by any means necessary. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized the administration’s commitment to exposing and punishing those working with Tehran’s destabilizing agenda. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent highlighted Iran’s willingness to exploit international crime organizations to achieve its objectives, regardless of the consequences for European communities. Rawa Majid, who fled to Iran in September 2023, remains wanted in Sweden for drug and weapons trafficking. Reports indicate he was recruited by Iranian intelligence to carry out attacks on Israeli and Jewish targets. His network’s violent feud with a splinter group led by former ally Ismail Abdo has turned Sweden’s streets into battlegrounds. As the United States ramps up its maximum pressure campaign against Iran, all property and interests belonging to Majid and the Foxtrot Network in the U.S. have been blocked. The Foxtrot Network’s violent operations remain a serious threat to communities across Europe.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hymutjfhje	2025-03-14T23:21:50-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/15/S1Xv5iM3yl/S1Xv5iM3yl_57_0_702_395_0_small.jpg
Trump administration weighs travel ban on dozens of countries, me...	Citizens of 10 countries, including Syria and Iran, are to be flat-out banned, while five others to face partial suspension with impact on tourism and student visas, while for 26 countries, suspension depends on their government actions The Trump administration is considering issuing sweeping travel restrictions for the citizens of dozens of countries as part of a new ban, according to sources familiar with the matter and an internal memo seen by Reuters. The memo lists a total of 41 countries divided into three separate groups. The first group of 10 countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, Cuba and North Korea, among others, would be set for a full visa suspension. In the second group, five countries - Eritrea, Haiti, Laos, Myanmar and South Sudan - would face partial suspensions that would impact tourist and student visas as well as other immigrant visas, with some exceptions. In the third group, a total of 26 countries that include Belarus, Pakistan and Turkmenistan among others would be considered for a partial suspension of U.S. visa issuance if their governments 'do not make efforts to address deficiencies within 60 days', the memo said. A U.S. official speaking on the condition of anonymity cautioned there could be changes on the list and that it was yet to be approved by the administration, including U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The New York Times first reported on the list of countries. The move harkens back to President Donald Trump's first-term ban on travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations, a policy that went through several iterations before it was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018. > Trump issued an executive order on January 20 requiring intensified security vetting of any foreigners seeking admission to the U.S. to detect national security threats. That order directed several cabinet members to submit by March 21 a list of countries from which travel should be partly or fully suspended because their 'vetting and screening information is so deficient.' Trump's directive is part of an immigration crackdown that he launched at the start of his second term. He previewed his plan in an October 2023 speech, pledging to restrict people from the Gaza Strip, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and 'anywhere else that threatens our security.' The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1qo99z3je	2025-03-14T22:40:37-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/14/HkeqUHbh1g/HkeqUHbh1g_0_278_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Witkoff: Hamas demands for hostage deal are 'unrealistic'	Steve Witkoff, the President's envoy to the Middle East, warned on Friday evening that Hamas is making 'unrealistic' demands behind the scenes, accusing it of gambling on time being in its favor while failing to meet critical deadlines Steve Witkoff, the President's envoy to the Middle East, said on Friday evening that Hamas is presenting 'unrealistic' demands behind the scenes, after announcing its willingness to release the hostage Edan Alexander along with four other dual-citizen hostages who were killed. 'Hamas is making a very poor gamble by believing that time is on its side. That is not the case. Hamas is well aware of the deadline and must understand that we will respond accordingly if it passes,' the envoy warned. He noted that last Wednesday, he presented a 'mediation' proposal to extend the ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover to allow time for negotiations over a permanent ceasefire. > 'According to the mediation proposal, Hamas will release live hostages in exchange for prisoners based on previous formulas. The first stage of the ceasefire will be extended to allow for the resumption of significant humanitarian aid, and the U.S. will work to achieve a stable solution to the ongoing conflict during the extended ceasefire period,' the statement read. 'Through our Qatari and Egyptian partners, it was made unequivocally clear to Hamas that the mediation must be implemented quickly—and that the American-Israeli citizen Edan Alexander must be released immediately. Unfortunately, Hamas has chosen to respond by publicly declaring flexibility while secretly presenting demands that are completely impossible without a permanent ceasefire.' On Friday afternoon, Hamas announced that it agrees to the release of Edan Alexander and four dual-citizen hostages who were killed. Israeli officials dismissed this as 'manipulation,' saying this is a framework proposed earlier by Trump's former hostage affairs envoy Adam Boehler, who has since been removed from his position. Sources 'involved in the negotiations' told the Saudi newspaper 'Asharq Al-Awsat' that Hamas' announcement is 'an initial agreement' awaiting discussions by 'all parties' involved in the negotiations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated on Friday evening that the Trump administration 'cares about all the hostages' when asked about the proposal. 'These exchanges are ridiculous. 400 prisoners for three. It's insane. They kidnapped children, babies, took them and put them in tunnels. We're acting as if these are normal exchanges. We should all agree that what Hamas did is ridiculous, sick, disgusting, and should never have happened. This is not a normal negotiation. These are bad people—we want all the hostages out.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byg6d1zh1x	2025-03-14T09:36:20-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/H1eDaU4Ekg/H1eDaU4Ekg_104_46_2712_1527_0_small.jpg

Israel anticipated Assad’s downfall would delay Iran’s nuclear am...	Resurfaced emails from Hillary Clinton’s 2012 cache reveal Israeli intelligence believed Bashar Assad’s fall would destabilize Iran and delay its nuclear program, sparking fears of wider sectarian conflict in the Middle East Nine years after former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s email scandal, the controversy has resurfaced amid ongoing battles in Syria following the collapse of Bashar Assad’s regime. A document from Clinton’s email, dated July 23, 2012, revealed that Israeli intelligence believed the fall of Assad’s regime would ignite a Sunni-Shiite war that would benefit Israel. The document was published on WikiLeaks, which is known for releasing classified political and military information from anonymous journalistic sources and leaks. According to an unnamed source cited by the site, British and French intelligence agencies believed Israel saw Assad’s downfall as a blow to Iran, isolating it by stripping away its only Middle Eastern ally — a scenario that ultimately unfolded. The document further read that Assad’s fall could escalate the sectarian conflict in the region and potentially draw in Iran, a development Israeli leaders reportedly did not view as unfavorable. Such a conflict, according to Israeli intelligence analysts at the time, could distract Iran and significantly delay its nuclear ambitions. Some senior Israeli intelligence officials even considered this scenario a possible catalyst for regime change in Iran. European officials, however, were concerned that Syria’s prolonged conflict could trigger uprisings in neighboring countries, including Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, potentially leading to the rise of Islamist regimes in place of more moderate governments. Israel, anticipating such developments, drafted contingency plans in case these nations fell under the control of the Muslim Brotherhood or even more radical groups like al-Qaeda. At the same time, fears of an Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities warned such action could worsen regional relations. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The document warned a potential attack on Iran could also further destabilize the global economy, with Israel facing blame. It could unite the Iranian population against the U.S. and strengthen ties between Iranians and the ruling ayatollahs rather than weaken them. European intelligence agencies also feared that an Israeli attack would push Iran to accelerate its nuclear weapons program with support from Russia and China. In 2012, Turkish military commanders privately stated that an Israeli strike on Iran would trigger a regional war 'before Israel’s first airstrike squadron even returns to base.' Turkish and European intelligence assessments at the time predicted that thousands of missiles and rockets would rain down on Israel from Iran, Lebanon, Syria and Gaza. Turkey’s military estimated that Hezbollah forces in Syria and Lebanon had access to more than 200,000 rockets and surface-to-surface missiles. Turkish defense analysts believed an attack from such an arsenal could overwhelm Israel’s defenses. Leaks also suggested that while Israel was not prepared for a full-scale war with Iran but sought instead to project an imminent threat. A reported plan involved using a Saudi airbase for a potential strike on Iran, then leaking details to the media to signal the West that Israel was serious about military action. However, the plan was ultimately not carried out. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyx50fxnyx	2025-03-14T05:45:05-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/13/H1lD11Nl21l/H1lD11Nl21l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
‘There’s fighting in the West Bank, but it’s mostly offensive’: I...	The 8211st Battalion’s relentless fight in the West Bank presents a story of sacrifice, unity and resilience, as reservists leave their civilian lives to protect Israel’s borders amid war Behind the IDF’s 8211th Battalion stands a force of about 500 reservists who left behind families, businesses and daily lives to fight. These soldiers embody the sacrifices made by Israel’s reserve forces in war. On the morning of October 7, they didn’t wait for a call, an official order or a summons — they deployed themselves and were quickly in action in the West Bank. The battalion fought in close-quarters encounters, eliminated terrorists and lost comrades. Their commander was wounded in an explosion and is now recovering in the hospital. As divisions deepen within Israeli society, the soldiers describe the unity they’ve found in the reserves and the family they’ve become. The unit completed its third round of reserve duty this weekend and is already preparing for the next, if needed. 'The West Bank is changing but we have to keep going. We’re here if we’re needed,' they say. Rapid combat deployment 'I was discharged two months before the war after serving in the Kfir Brigade,' says Maj. A., 28, a company commander in the battalion, married and a father living in Moshav Gadi in the Jordan Valley. 'I got a call from the battalion commander and I was there,' he recalled. 'Our deployment isn’t standard. Even before the war, we were designated as a pilot unit — one that can reach its equipment depot and be operational within hours. During the war, our forces entered Qalqilya, and that was about protecting home for me — taking control of our sector.' The battalion, part of the Ephraim Brigade, operated across the northern West Bank and the Jordan Valley, manning checkpoints, conducting arrests, dispersing riots and securing the region. It was the frontline force tasked with providing security to West Bank residents, preventing terrorist infiltrations into central Israel and ensuring that an October 7 scenario wouldn’t unfold in the region’s communities. In one mission, led by Lt. Col. Y., the battalion raided a site in the village of Azzun, where a terror cell was hiding. A close-quarters gunfight ensued, ending with four terrorists killed and large amounts of weaponry seized. The cell, which had been planning a major attack in the West Bank or central Israel, was neutralized. 'There’s fighting in the West Bank, but it’s mostly offensive, not defensive,' Maj. A. explained. 'When we entered the cluster of villages in the Jordan Valley, we did so with an unprecedented show of force — armed drones, missiles, armored personnel carriers and tanks. 'The enemy is ultimately cowardly. They fight from within civilian areas and plant explosives in the ground. They fired at me a few times while I was in my jeep — not face-to-face, but from an alley. They shoot and hide.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: A final embrace After months of combat, the battalion faced a devastating blow. 'In every operation, we were professional, we sought direct engagement, and we always won. Then the charge exploded. That was a defining moment for our soldiers,' Maj. A. said. On the night of January 20, Battalion Commander Lt. Col. Y. and his command team set out for a reconnaissance mission near the village of Tammun in the Jordan Valley. They hit an explosive charge. The driver, Sergeant First Class (res.) Eviatar Ben Yehuda, 31, from the settlement of Nitzan, a father of two, was killed. Lt. Col. Y. was rushed to Sheba Medical Center and has been recovering since. 'I had just arrived at the battalion hours before the explosion,' recalled Maj. D., another company commander. 'I was signing out my gear when I met the battalion commander and Eviatar. He gave me such a strong hug — I didn’t understand why. I wasn’t feeling well that day and it lifted my spirits. When the news came about the explosion, it was crushing.' 'There’s a huge gap between how people perceive the Jordan Valley and what’s happening on the ground,' he continued. 'On one hand, it looks pastoral. On the other, everything can change in an instant. Y., our commander, always talked about that.' A battalion’s resilience Lt. Col. T., Y.’s deputy who took over command after the injury, says the loss hit hard. 'Mentally, Y. was a highly respected commander. No one believed he could be hit. It shook us — we suddenly felt vulnerable. But the event sharpened our readiness. At that moment, I asked myself, ‘What would Y. do if he were in my place?’ The answer was clear. 'I went from company to company, told them what had happened and we held a deeply emotional ceremony. I told them, ‘You have until sunrise to process this. Once the sun rises, we get up strong.’ That’s when we found our resilience.' The battalion pressed on with its offensive operations in the northern West Bank. Then, another devastating loss struck. On February 4, a terrorist ambushed the battalion’s soldiers at the Tayasir checkpoint in the Jordan Valley. 'As I was driving, I got a report that the terrorist had infiltrated the post and a firefight was underway. My greatest fear was a massacre,' said Battalion Commander Lt. Col. T., who rushed to the scene with his men. 'The engagement lasted about seven minutes,' he said of the gunfight that ended with the terrorist neutralized. But the cost was high. Sergeant major (res.) Ofer Yung, 39, from Tel Aviv, a father of two and a squad commander; and Sergeant major (res.) Avraham Tzvi Tzivka Friedman, 45, from Kibbutz Ein Hanatziv, a father of six, were killed. Several others were wounded. 'It was a brutal situation — both mentally and operationally. We were in the middle of an operation, with forces still deployed. We lost three of our brothers, all fathers. But we had a mission to complete. War has a price,' Lt. Col. T. said. Bonds beyond service The battalion continues to support the families of its fallen and wounded. 'When you join this battalion, you join a family,' Lt. Col. T. shared. 'The soldiers know each other intimately and even their wives are connected. Yes, we fight for ideals but in the end, we show up for reserve duty because of the people standing next to us. The human fabric of this unit is unique. 'There’s a lot of division in Israeli society but in this battalion, people from completely different backgrounds are willing to die for each other. That’s our secret. Our spirit is stronger than anything. We’re here, waiting for the next call.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byntriw21e	2025-03-14T05:43:52-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/12/yk14293610/yk14293610_0_113_791_445_0_small.jpg
Israeli negotiation team to return from Qatar on Friday	The Israeli negotiation team for the cease-fire deal with Hamas is set to return from Doha to Israel on Friday. Israeli officials accused Hamas of attempting to drive a wedge between Israel and the United States, claiming the terror group’s announcement about releasing hostages amounted to 'cheap manipulation.' The statement followed Hamas’ declaration that it had agreed to release kidnapped Israeli-American soldier Edan Alexander and four other captives with dual nationality. Israeli officials dismissed the claim as a tactic to create discord amid ongoing U.S.-mediated negotiations.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk62niz21l	2025-03-14T05:20:21-07:00

Hamas regains strength as Israel’s Gaza cease-fire allows terror ...	Terror group bolsters control in the Strip as Israel’s de facto pause in fighting without the release of hostages, allowing terrorists to regroup In recent days, the IDF has been eliminating an average of three to four suspected terrorists in Gaza daily, identifying them as Hamas operatives planting explosives near the border. The terror group has not responded, seemingly content with the de facto cease-fire Israel has granted it — after at least two weeks without hostages being released, allowing Hamas to bolster its positions deeper inside the Strip. Israel has effectively reached the limit of its sanctions package, rolling back almost all humanitarian concessions, except for allowing around 50 wounded and sick Palestinians to exit Gaza daily via the Rafah crossing into Egypt for medical treatment. Security officials are monitoring the evacuees to ensure senior Hamas commanders are not among them but Israel sees an overall benefit in more Gazans leaving, even if in limited numbers. Other measures that were reportedly reversed include what officials call political spin. For example, Energy Minister Eli Cohen announced earlier this week that Israel had cut power to Deir al-Balah, but the affected line only supplied a desalination plant — not electricity to Gaza itself. As for water, three main pipelines remain operational, and the partial relocation of displaced residents from al-Mawasi back toward Gaza City has balanced consumption, preventing shortages. Gazans also rely on wells and agricultural activity has resumed in parts of the Strip. The desalination facility in Deir al-Balah, which previously provided 15,000 liters (3,960 gallons) of water per day, was not seen as critical by Israeli officials, who say there is no imminent risk of widespread thirst. However, UNICEF has warned that Gaza’s water crisis has reached 'critical levels,' saying that 'only one in 10 people have access to clean drinking water.' The UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) said that halting humanitarian aid is endangering lives after 17 months of war, with most of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents relying on assistance. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The head of Gaza’s Bakery Owners Association, Abed al-Nasser al-Ajrami, said six of the 22 remaining bakeries in the Strip have shut down due to a lack of cooking gas. The nine power lines from Israel that supplied Gaza before the war were destroyed — mostly by Hamas — eliminating the 120 megawatts the Palestinians purchased daily from Israel. Before the war, this provided about four hours of electricity per day, supplemented by diesel-powered generators and thousands of solar panels, some of which Hamas used to supply energy to its bunkers in Gaza City. Some solar panels remain functional, as do generators, which are now Gaza’s main power source. As part of a previous deal, Israel allowed around 50 fuel and gas trucks into Gaza daily for a month and a half — a significant supply still under Hamas’s control. 'We don’t really know how Hamas distributed this fuel, how much they have left or what it's being used for,' a security official said. 'Some international estimates suggest it could last for weeks or even months.' Other security officials assessed Hamas’s gains from the cease-fire. 'Every day of a cease-fire that Hamas uses to prepare for renewed fighting is like a month of preparation for us,' one said. 'Its control over civilian life is growing, with Ramadan meals funded by institutions like the Bank of Palestine, which serves as Hamas’s financial clearinghouse in Gaza. We shut down the border crossings but we didn’t destroy its stockpiles.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryozrkw2ke	2025-03-14T04:19:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/22/Hyj118gP5kg/Hyj118gP5kg_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Hamas accepts US deal to free dual-citizen IDF soldier, four dece...	Terror group conditionally agrees to U.S.-backed deal for Edan Alexander’s release and hostage bodies; Netanyahu to hold situation assessment Friday Hamas announced on Friday that it had 'responded positively' to a U.S.-brokered proposal to release kidnapped IDF soldier Edan Alexander, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen, along with the bodies of four other hostages who also hold dual citizenship. The terror group added that it was 'ready to begin negotiations for a comprehensive agreement, including the deal's second phase,' and called for Israel to be 'held accountable for fully implementing its commitments.' U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff worked with mediators to propose a deal centered on releasing three to five living hostages and several bodies in exchange for a 50-day cease-fire, during which negotiations would continue for the next phase of the agreement. Against this backdrop, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to hold a security assessment on Friday with ministers and top defense officials to discuss the ongoing negotiations. Israel has also accepted the framework proposed by Witkoff but is demanding an increase in the number of living hostages to be released. Jerusalem has effectively presented a counterproposal seeking more hostages' release, in addition to the bodies. The U.S. has insisted that Alexander be among those freed. Talks have not yet begun on the number of Palestinian prisoners who would be released in exchange for each hostage, making it unclear whether Hamas' announcement represents a major breakthrough. However, it does signal some progress. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sources who recently spoke with Witkoff described his commitment to the hostage issue as 'very deep' and said it stems from 'a Jewish, almost mystical place.' According to them, 'His heart is in this and he'll do everything he can to bring the hostages home.' The first phase of the hostage deal officially ended on March 1. Since then, the cease-fire has continued without Hamas releasing any additional captives, while the terror group has strengthened its position under relative calm. This is despite Netanyahu's repeated assertion that 'there will be no cease-fire without the release of our hostages.' Some 59 hostages remain in Gaza, 24 of whom are officially classified as alive. Israel has conducted limited strikes in response to what it deems cease-fire violations and has also halted all humanitarian aid to Gaza in an effort to pressure Hamas. It additionally cut electricity supplies to water desalination facilities in the Strip, a move security officials warned could endanger the hostages. Several families of captives have already petitioned Israel’s Supreme Court against the measure. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryktxcb21x	2025-03-14T03:44:18-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/r1O5Vorl5Jx/r1O5Vorl5Jx_0_114_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Syria thwarts large-scale drug smuggling attempt to Jordan	Following the interception of a major drug smuggling attempt, Syrian officials accused remnants of the ousted Assad government of running organized crime rings Syrian authorities on Wednesday successfully foiled an attempt to smuggle a significant quantity of illicit stimulant pills across the Syrian-Jordanian border, preventing the narcotics from entering Jordan. This interception highlights the new Syrian government’s determination to prevent local instability from being exploited at the hands of criminal networks. The Syrian Ministry of Interior announced that its Anti-Narcotics Directorate seized 100,000 of the stimulant pills known as Captagon near the border. In a statement to The Media Line, the ministry’s media office confirmed that the confiscated shipment was intended for smuggling into Jordan, emphasizing that legal measures would be taken against those involved. Speaking anonymously to The Media Line, a security source said that Syrian counternarcotics forces are determined not to let Syria become a threat to neighboring countries and the wider region. 'We will continue to combat drug production, trafficking and dismantle networks at their source,' the source said. The source went on to accuse remnants of the ousted Assad regime of being deeply involved in drug manufacturing and smuggling operations. He stressed that the current Syrian administration is resolute in its efforts to confront and dismantle these networks. The illicit drug trade, particularly involving Captagon, flourished during the Syrian civil war. According to various intelligence reports, then-President Bashar Assad and his brother Maher Assad, who commanded Syria’s notorious 4th Armored Division, oversaw a vast, sophisticated drug production and smuggling network. That network reportedly funneled narcotics across the region—with Jordan serving as a primary transit point to Gulf countries and beyond. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Since the escalation of the Israel-Hezbollah conflict last summer and the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024, the drug trade in Syria has reportedly declined. Syrian authorities are working to dismantle the remaining drug production hubs and assert control over border regions plagued by smuggling activities. In January 2025, Jordan and Syria established a joint security committee to enhance border security and curb the smuggling of weapons and narcotics. This initiative followed Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani’s visit to Jordan, during which both sides pledged to intensify cooperation to safeguard their borders. Jordanian authorities report foiling numerous smuggling attempts, often carried out by infiltrators linked to Iranian-backed militias operating in southern Syria. In May 2024, Jordanian forces uncovered an attempt to smuggle weapons and explosives from Syria into Jordan, allegedly intended to arm and recruit fighters for Hamas. That attempt was thought to be linked to Iran. Iran has consistently denied any involvement in smuggling activities along the Syrian-Jordanian border, whether of arms or narcotics.

40 minutes too late': IDF report details Hamas' attack on Nir Oz...	The small kibbutz, abandoned during terror group's October 7 onslaught, faced 500 terrorists alone — leading to 47 deaths, 76 kidnappings and a belated military apology; IDF probe into attack reveals critical vulnerabilities The IDF on Friday published its investigation into Hamas' attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7, revealing shocking failures. At the height of the murderous invasion, 500 bloodthirsty terrorists stormed the small community of 385 residents, who clung to their shelter doors with their last strength — without a single soldier present. The terrorists executed entire families, burned people alive and abducted civilians without interference until they were ordered from Gaza to return to Khan Younis. Only six homes in the entire kibbutz were left untouched. The heroism of seven members of the local alert squad, who were either murdered or kidnapped while fighting 150 Nukhba terrorists, prevented an even greater disaster. The community remains far from recovery. 40 minutes too late Forty minutes passed from the moment the last of the roughly 500 terrorists left Nir Oz at 12:30 p.m. until any security force entered the kibbutz. The first to arrive were undercover Border Police officers responding to a police dispatch — not the IDF. The military was completely unaware of the massacre unfolding in Nir Oz for over seven hours. 'This was the failure within the failure of October 7,' admitted former IDF chief of staff Herzi Halevi to the survivors on Thursday, asking for their forgiveness. Officers accompanying him quickly realized that the traumatized residents, now living in Kiryat Gat, remained far from rehabilitation and had not received the unique governmental support they desperately needed. The IDF's investigation into the fall of Nir Oz spanned eight months and gathered thousands of testimonies, recordings and images. The complexity of the findings led the military to appoint Maj. Gen. (res.) Eran Niv, a former commander of the IDF's West Bank divisions, to head the inquiry. Niv had prior experience dealing with chaos, having commanded Hebron Brigade during the Second Intifada in 2005 when terrorists massacred Israelis near the Cave of the Patriarchs, killing the regional brigade commander, Col. Dror Weinberg. Unlike that attack, the Nir Oz investigation lacked an IDF force that had fought inside the kibbutz, making it reliant on traumatized civilian survivors, injured witnesses, limited intelligence and terrorist interrogations. At the end of the investigation, Niv said that reconstructing the events at Nir Oz reminded him of the Hebrew poem 'In the City of Slaughter,' which described the 1903 Kishinev pogrom. Every Nir Oz resident was affected by the October 7 massacre — whether by execution, burning, kidnapping or injury. Only six homes were left untouched before the terrorists received an order around noon to retreat to Gaza, with commanders telling them: 'You're done.' Roughly 10% of the 5,000 terrorists who invaded the western Negev took part in the kibbutz massacre, which was largely forgotten on that black Saturday. Over 500 terrorists against civilians At the peak of the attack, there were more Gazan terrorists in Nir Oz than Israeli civilians, with no IDF troops present. Between 400 and 500 terrorists overran the kibbutz, where 385 civilians (out of 420 residents) were present that morning, including foreign workers. Nir Oz, located just 1.8 miles (3 km) from Gaza near Khan Younis, had no military outpost between it and the border — a longstanding failure of the IDF Southern Command. Without the residents’ desperate fight to hold their shelter doors, an entire Israeli community could have been wiped out in the absence of any security forces for hours. On October 7, 47 civilians were murdered in Nir Oz, including six who were attending a nearby party. Seventy-six were kidnapped to Khan Younis — 67 alive, nine dead. Of them, 49 were later returned to Israel in hostage deals with Hamas. One released hostage, Hanna Katzir, died months after returning. Thirteen Nir Oz captives were executed in Hamas captivity, 13 bodies were returned and 14 remain in Gaza — five alive, nine deceased. Critical military failures The investigation included a recording from the deputy commander of Golani Brigade's 51st Battalion, responsible for the sector that weekend, saying over military radio that a quiet weekend was expected with no border protests. The battalion had 182 combat soldiers and 57 support personnel in the northern Eshkol region, prepared for an infiltration scenario from a single point without warning. Near their base, Judy and Gadi Weinstein were preparing for their 6:06 a.m. morning walk, unaware they would be Nir Oz’s first victims that day. Although not classified as a 'border-adjacent' community like Nahal Oz or Kfar Aza, Nir Oz is situated very close to the Gaza border. That morning, 450 rockets were fired at the area, targeting IDF outposts defending not only Nir Oz but nearby kibbutzim like Nirim, Kissufim, Magen and Ein Hashlosha. The first Golani forces in the region were operating outside their base due to a revised protocol that had replaced an older dawn-readiness procedure. As a result, when the attack began at 6:30 a.m., the troops moved toward the border instead of the kibbutzim — a mistake later acknowledged in the investigation. This left Nir Oz particularly vulnerable. Two stationary IDF tanks were assigned to the Nir Oz sector that morning, one was found to be inoperable. This was the same tank later paraded as a Hamas victory symbol, with terrorists waving Palestinian flags atop it. Survivors from Golani units harshly criticized the IDF for stripping them of basic combat equipment, such as fragmentation grenades and LAW missiles, which could have helped counter the attack. A significant portion of the investigation focused on the heroism of Nir Oz’s emergency alert squad — seven armed residents who fought 150 terrorists, delaying some of the killings and kidnappings for about two hours. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Despite their resistance, the terrorists entered every home except for six. The destruction in Nir Oz was extensive, though less severe than in Kfar Aza or Be'eri, as no IDF tanks or bulldozers entered the kibbutz. However, widespread arson, looting and vandalism left deep scars. Apart from a brief tank intervention at 9:55 a.m. that killed a few terrorists before withdrawing to rescue another unit, Nir Oz was defended only from the air. Israeli Air Force helicopters struggled to establish situational awareness but managed to eliminate dozens of terrorists. However, they also mistakenly struck some hostages. The failure to coordinate aerial reports with the desperate messages from trapped residents highlighted a critical breakdown in communication. Key mistakes and lessons from the investigation No operational processes were taken to analyze the images from the surveillance, attack helicopters or civilian reports due to the collapse of the operations room and a lack of understanding by the General Staff and Southern Command, overwhelmed by numerous reports from various combat zones. The nearby IDF camp, which was supposed to protect the kibbutz, was not built as a fortified position and resembled a basic field base, similar to the Nahal Oz base. As a result, it was quickly overrun and the forces there were engaged in defensive battles instead of moving out to protect the surrounding towns. Nevertheless, the report concluded that the base should not have fallen as it did. A major error was the established procedure in the Gaza Division, which prioritized border protection over safeguarding nearby settlements like Nir Oz. This led to a critical hour being wasted, as forces from the sector did not reach the towns near the border area. The local alert squad consisted of 16 members, but only 9 were present and all were either kidnapped or killed that morning. Four of them formed an expanded team with three armed civilians, while three others fought near their homes against waves of attackers. The investigation recommended to ensure that at least 10% of each town's residents near hostile borders should have rifles, not just personal handguns, in addition to the local alert squad. The reasons for the major failure in Nir Oz were the delayed arrival of forces. Southern Command’s decision on October 7 to flood the Gaza envelope with troops was correct but lacked focus. Troops were not sent to specific locations and many soldiers were halted by the first combat zone they encountered or diverted by sporadic calls and messages on the phone or WhatsApp. Nir Oz, located on the outskirts of a cluster of settlements in the Gaza envelope and not on the main road (Route 232), was overlooked and neglected. Intelligence failure on October 7: Southern Command blamed Unit 8200 not only for blindness leading up to the invasion but also for the long and difficult day of the massacre. If SIGINT (signals intelligence) had been used to track cell phone and radio communications throughout the day, the large movement of hundreds of Hamas fighters in Nir Oz could have been detected. Two reserve platoons from the Egoz Brigade were on standby for the Gaza Division from the Tze'elim base on Friday and were sent to reinforce the West Bank. However, the investigation raised doubts about their relevance to the situation in Nir Oz specifically, as they could have been fighting in other combat zones just as effectively. Central timeline – Nir Oz 6:40 a.m. – After dozens out of 450 rocket and mortar launches targeting the outposts in the Kisufim sector, the IDF's divisional operations room receives the first indications of terrorist infiltrations from the border fence. 6:42 a.m. – The southern brigade commander responsible for the sector, Col. Asaf Hamami, leaves the regional division base in Re’im toward Kibbutz Nirim near Nir Oz. He declares a readiness for war over the communication network and calls for the mobilization of standby squads and special units, but is killed in battle shortly after near the entrance to Nirim. 6:45 a.m. – Two out of three surveillance posts in the sector are taken out due to a precise Hamas attack on IDF observation towers. No rear command processes the severe footage being transmitted from the sole remaining operational post. 6:49 a.m. – Two vehicles from a nearby party manage to enter Kibbutz Nir Oz at high speed but the three following vehicles are hit by gunfire from the first terrorists invading Nir Oz from its northern corner. 6:51 a.m. – Former hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen is alerted and reports detail an exchange of fire in the area. His later heroism as a lookout for the local alert squad will help prevent an even greater massacre. 6:57 a.m. – The first and main Hamas attack wave, consisting of about 150 Nukhba terrorists, takes over the kibbutz almost unopposed. 7:00 a.m. – Golani soldiers struggle to reach Kibbutz Nir Oz and nearby settlements as they are engaged in defensive battles in the area and at outposts. 7:05 a.m. – There is no command and control over the Nir Oz area after Col. Hamami also falls in battle, losing communication with him. He is effectively declared missing. 7:08 a.m. – Golani officer Capt. Omer Wolf manages to issue a critical command before being killed in battle at an IDF outpost near Nir Oz: Instead of deploying toward the border as per the division’s standard procedure — which proved to be flawed — forces should move inland toward the sector’s settlements. Wolf does not live to see his directive implemented; he is killed 20 minutes later in battle. 7:14 a.m. – Dekel-Chen reports in an internal WhatsApp group that some terrorists dressed as soldiers inside the kibbutz clinic. This report prevents injured civilians from approaching what has become a death zone. The kibbutz security coordinator tries to link up with a Golani force but fails and launches a solo assault. He is wounded by gunfire, manages to extract himself to his home's shelter, and struggles to communicate due to poor reception in the following hours. Seven members of the alert squad, including armed civilians, become the only force fighting in the kibbutz against over 100 Nukhba terrorists swarming every corner. 7:28 a.m. – The terrorists reach the kibbutz's Thai workers' housing complex. A massacre ensues, exacerbated by language barriers and desperate screams of confusion. Nine workers are brutally murdered. 7:49 a.m. – Ohad Yahalomi, a 50-year-old kibbutz member, fights the terrorists. Later in the morning, he is kidnapped to Gaza and murdered in captivity. 8:20-8:30 a.m. – The terrorists focus on abducting civilians from the kibbutz. Residents attempt to hide, escape and scatter but are unsuccessful and are taken hostage by Hamas. Among them are Ofer, Erez and Sahar Kalderon, as well as Oded and Yocheved Lifshitz. 8:41 a.m. – The last battle of the kibbutz's standby squad lasts until 9:00 a.m. By its end, Tamir Eder, Dolev Yehud and Aviv Atzili are murdered. The rest are wounded or kidnapped. The small Nir Oz standby squad's two-hour-long fierce fight delays the Nukhba terrorists, but the IDF does not arrive. 8:45 a.m. – The kidnappings continue. The Cooper family is abducted in their car. Ronen Engel from the kibbutz is killed while trying to prevent terrorists from kidnapping his family. 8:46 a.m. – Two IDF companies arrive to fight at Ma'on Junction. However, no IDF command directs the 150 soldiers to run even the two miles to nearby Nir Oz. The large force halts its fight at the junction due to another mission to reach Kisufim and Kerem Shalom. On the way, they rescue hostages, engage in combat and encounter ambushes. 9:22 a.m. – The first IDF force reaches Kibbutz Nir Oz, but from the air: an Air Force attack helicopter hovers over the settlement, requesting authorization to fire into Israeli territory. Initial identification is difficult due to distinguishing between terrorists and civilians. The helicopter takes fire from terrorists and is forced into an emergency landing. Additional helicopters arrive in five waves around 10:00 a.m., killing dozens of terrorists attempting a second-wave infiltration but also mistakenly killing Efrat Katz. Mika and Yuval Engel are injured by helicopter fire while their captors are transporting them to Gaza. 9:47 a.m. – The terrorists do not waste time with the siege on residents barricaded in safe rooms and refusing to exit.

Israeli embassy completes Myanmar orphanage renovation honoring B...	Local delegation to Yangon renovates orphanage for war orphans, honoring Ariel and Kfir Bibas with a mural using paint from their kibbutz The Israeli embassy in Yangon, Myanmar, has completed its flagship project: renovating an orphanage dedicated to the memory of Ariel and Kfir Bibas. The centerpiece of the initiative is a restored mural by artist Or Yogev, painted on the orphanage wall using paint from Nirlat, a factory in Kibbutz Nir Oz — their home —under the title, 'From the children of Nir Oz to the children of Yangon.' The project, launched about a year ago before the official announcement of Ariel and Kfir’s deaths, was completed in a tragic turn of events just two hours before the news was confirmed. As a result of the renovations, the orphanage has expanded and now houses 30 children, all war orphans from northern Myanmar who lost their parents in the ongoing conflict. Before the Israeli embassy's involvement, the orphanage was in severe neglect, with children sleeping in a fenced-off open area and no kitchen on site. Under the embassy’s initiative, significant renovations were carried out: a separate dormitory for boys was built, a small kitchen was installed, a proper sewage system was put in place and the walls were plastered and painted with Israeli-made Nirlat colors.

The embassy also supplied school supplies. During the renovations, the local monastery leader held a special prayer for the Bibas children before news of their deaths was confirmed. Shiri Bibas' sister was informed about the project and was deeply moved by the tribute.

Israel didn't lost to Hamas—it lost to itself'	Noga Tarnopolsky: 'Israel is trampling on an existing agreement and trying to conjure up fantasies of another, of a better agreement, but Hamas doesn't want to give it a better agreement, and Hamas has a signed deal in hand' It is not that Hamas has won the battle over the hostage-for-ceasefire deal, but rather that Israel has lost, according to Noga Tarnopolsky, Israel correspondent for France24. Speaking on ILTV’s Insider, Tarnopolsky said Israel’s loss is 'self-inflicted.' She explained that Israel 'brazenly' violated the international agreement it made with Hamas, which stated that negotiations for Phase II were supposed to begin on Day 16 of the Phase I agreement. 'Israel walked away cavalierly, as though there was no commitment,' Tarnopolsky said. 'Israel committed to redeploying its forces and to abandoning what's called the Philadelphi Corridor, the Gaza-Egypt border on day 42. We ignored that completely. Israel is trampling on an existing agreement and trying to conjure up fantasies of another, of a better agreement, but Hamas doesn't want to give it a better agreement, and Hamas has a signed deal in hand. 'So we are at a standstill, by and large, caused by Israel,' she continued. 'It is very bad for Israel, very mismanaged by Israel.' Watch previous episode's of Insider: Did Hamas Outsmart the IDF? Will Israel Resume Military Action Next Week? Israeli Sovereignty Over Judea & Samaria: Is this Prophecy Unfolding? Is Israel Winning This War, Or Just Prolonging The Inevitable? Tarnopolsky’s comments came as U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff was in Doha, negotiating with Qatar on behalf of Israel. He told the media that there appeared to be some breakthroughs this week, with Hamas showing signs of softening toward a new deal. The proposed agreement would include the release of 10 live hostages in exchange for 50 days of quiet in Gaza, among other components. However, it remained unclear whether the deal would move forward. Wasserman Lande: A New Deal Must Bring the Hostages Home Ruth Wasserman Lande, who also appeared on Insider, pushed back on Tarnopolsky’s claims, arguing that the original agreement was 'absolutely awful,' but that it did succeed in bringing the first group of hostages home. 'We need those people back before anything truly will move forward,' Wasserman Lande said. 'Plus, it would be very useful and very advisable to have a strategy—a strategy as in, what do we want that terrible term ‘the day after’ to look like? Whom do we want or do not want in the Gaza Strip?' She referenced former U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion that Gazans could be relocated to other countries, stating that she would not dismiss such a plan outright. She also emphasized the need for Israel to define a role for Egypt and Jordan in the future of Gaza. However, Wasserman Lande stressed that before any of these decisions can be made, the hostages must be brought home. 'It would free Israel from the chains it's in now, but it's also the moral responsibility of any government to first bring them back,' she said.

Report: US and Israel look to Africa for 'resettling Palestinians...	Officials say plan looks to move Gaza Palestinians to Sudan, Somalia and Somaliland; White House says Trump 'stands by his vision' for the Strip The U.S. and Israel have reached out to officials of three East African governments to discuss using their territories as potential destinations for resettling Palestinians from the Gaza Strip under U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed post-war plan, American and Israeli officials say. The contacts with Sudan, Somalia and the breakaway region of Somalia known as Somaliland reflect the determination by the U.S. and Israel to press ahead with a plan that has been widely condemned and raised serious legal and moral issues. Because all three places are poor, and in some cases wracked by violence, the proposal also casts doubt on Trump’s stated goal of resettling Gaza’s Palestinians in a 'beautiful area.' Officials from Sudan said they have rejected overtures from the U.S., while officials from Somalia and Somaliland said that they were not aware of any contacts. The idea of a mass transfer of Palestinians was once considered a fantasy of Israel’s ultranationalist fringe. But since Trump presented the idea at a White House meeting last month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hailed it as a ' bold vision.' Palestinians in Gaza have rejected the proposal and dismiss Israeli claims that the departures would be voluntary. Arab nations have expressed vehement opposition and offered an alternative reconstruction plan that would leave the Palestinians in place. Still, the White House says Trump 'stands by his vision.' > Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a secret diplomatic initiative, U.S. and Israeli officials confirmed the contacts with Somalia and Somaliland, while the Americans confirmed Sudan as well. They said it was unclear how much progress the efforts made or at what level the discussions took place. Separate outreach from the U.S. and Israel to the three potential destinations began last month, days after Trump floated the Gaza plan alongside Netanyahu, according to the U.S. officials, who said that Israel was taking the lead in the discussions. Israel and the U.S. have a variety of incentives — financial, diplomatic and security — to offer these potential partners. It is a formula that Trump used five years ago when he brokered the Abraham Accords — a series of mutually beneficial diplomatic accords between Israel and four Arab countries. The White House declined to comment on the outreach efforts. The offices of Netanyahu and close prime minister ally Ron Dermer who has been leading Israel’s postwar planning, also had no comment. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a longtime advocate of the emigration of Palestinians, said this week that Israel is working to identify countries to take in Palestinians. He also said Israel is preparing a 'very large emigration department' within its Defense Ministry.

‘No one can protect you’: Columbia University urges foreign stude...	Pro-Palestinian protest epicenter warns international students to avoid Middle East-related posts as Trump’s administration freezes $400 million in funding and threatens deportations A few days after the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a leader of the pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University in New York, the university's administration called an urgent meeting for foreign students and senior faculty members on Thursday. The message was clear: international students must refrain from publishing content related to Gaza, Ukraine and protests sparked by Khalil's arrest. The meeting took place in the Pulitzer Building, one of the university's landmarks. The room was packed, with a tense atmosphere. Some students took notes while others stared in shock at the speakers. Prof. Stuart Carl, an expert on the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment, told students that the Trump administration's new policy of deporting international students who joined protests against Israel could jeopardize their academic futures and personal freedom. 'If you have a social media account, don't be filled with articles about the Middle East,' Carl warned. When a Palestinian student objected, Journalism School Dean Jelani Cobb was even more direct: 'No one can protect you. This is a dangerous time.' The warning came after U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration announced it was freezing $400 million in federal grants to the university, citing its failure to adequately combat antisemitism on campus. The decision sent shockwaves through Columbia and the academic world, leaving the university's administration scrambling to survive. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'All eyes are on us,' wrote President Katrin Armstrong in a letter to students. A university once known for its free speech and activism had become a battleground against the administration, with its financial and academic future uncertain. Khalil’s arrest, as a permanent resident with a green card, heightened the tension. According to the White House, Khalil is expected to be deported as part of a tougher stance against students labeled 'pro-terrorist and anti-American.' The administration also demanded that Columbia provide information on students involved in 'pro-Hamas activities,' but received no response. Protests against the decision quickly followed. Pro-Palestinian student groups, along with Jewish activists from the Jewish Voice for Peace organization, demonstrated outside Trump Tower in Manhattan. Dozens of them entered the lobby, chanting 'Fight Nazis, not students' and 'Stop arming Israel.' Reports from the scene indicated that around 200 protesters in red shirts, some wearing white kippahs, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, called for Khalil's release and an end to the 'attack' on pro-Palestinian activists. Building security appeared powerless as protesters took over the lobby and climbed railings. The event was streamed live on social media and more than 100 were eventually arrested. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s federal task force on combating antisemitism announced it was considering freezing funds for mayors across the U.S., including those in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Boston. The team is set to meet with mayors and local law enforcement officials 'to discuss their response to antisemitism in schools and universities in their jurisdictions.' Leo Terrell, the team’s leader, stressed, 'Too many public officials have chosen not to confront the wave of antisemitism since October 7. Actions have consequences. So do inactions.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryvqdag3kx	2025-03-13T13:59:45-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/13/HyxwHuglnJe/HyxwHuglnJe_1_145_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu says former, current Shin Bet chiefs guilty of extortio...	Shin Bet says accusations are grave and false; prime minister responds to an interview by former chief Argaman who warns that if Netanyahu violates the law, he would devulge information he has kept to himself out of respect for both positions Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday accused the former and current chiefs of the Shin Bet of extortion. Netanyahu said Ronen Bar and his predecessor Nadav Argaman were committing crimes against a sitting prime minister. Netanyahu spoke after Argaman, who was appointed by the prime minister and served as the head of Shin Bet from 2016 until 2021, said in an interview that Netanyahu had attempted to buy quiet along the southern border with Qatari money. The former Shin Bet chief who had expressed criticism over the government's legislative push to weaken the judiciary, said he has thus far refrained from revealing information out of respect for the working relations between the head of the internal security agency and the leader of the government but if he would see Netanyahu violating the law, he would speak out and reveal all he knows. The Shin Bet was currently investigating members of Netanyahu's inner circle who allegedly received payment from Qatar for advocating for the Gulf nation. Netanyahu said Argaman's threats were part of Bar's extortion campaign through daily briefings to reporters. The prime minister has signaled his intention to fire Bar, a move that would pose a conflict of interest amid the ongoing investigation. 'This is a serious accusation against the head of a national organization,' the Shin Bet said in a statement. 'Ronen Bar, as chief, was devoting all of his time to matters of security, efforts to bring about the release of the hostages and the protection of democracy. Any other statement on the matter would be baseless.' Argaman denied that he had threatened Netanyahu and said heads of the Shin Bet naturally are privy to much information, 'but we do not throw threats around. If we would think that things we know of, pose a danger to Israel's national security, we would use them according to the law.' He went on to say that Israel would know how to deal with the many enemies that threaten it from outside, but the fracturing Israeli society from within could be beyond repair. |I am concerned over the fact that the prime minister is intentionally harming Israeli society, causing friction between members of the population, to preserve his rule.' > Netanyahu has refused to panel a national commission of inquiry into the failings of his government, the IDF and the security services leading up to the Oct. 7 massacre and the ensuing war. The military and the Shin Bet conducted internal probes into their failings and the leaders have assumed responsibility for those failures. Netanyahu said that Bar was responsible for the Shin Bet's intelligence failures and denied reports that Bar had warned him that there would be no way to avoid war with Hamas and had urged him to allow targeted killings of its leaders. The prime minister claimed he had instructed Bar to prepare to take action against Hamas, but the Shin Bet chief did nothing. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b18caag3kg	2025-03-13T13:46:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/13/SyXv5ng3yl/SyXv5ng3yl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Miami Beach mayor moves to defund theater screening Israeli-Pales...	Mayor Steven Meiner calls No Other Land, which is critical of Israel's military rule over the West Bank, a 'false propaganda attack,' prompting a bid to terminate O Cinema’s lease and funding Miami Beach announced plans to terminate the lease of the local O Cinema theatre and immediately revoke its municipal funding after it screened the Oscar-winning Israeli-Palestinian documentary No Other Land. In a message to residents, Miami Beach Mayor Steven Meiner, whose city has a large Jewish and Israeli population, called the film ' a false one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people that is not consistent with the values of our city and residents.' The documentary, which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, depicts the demolition of Palestinian villages in the southern West Bank by the IDF. Since its win, the film has faced criticism from both pro-Israel figures — including Culture Minister Miki Zohar, who called it 'sabotage' of Israel's image — and pro-Palestinian voices who argued that the filmmakers, Basel Adra, Yuval Abraham, Hamdan Ballal and Rachel Szor, failed to 'acknowledge that Israel was committing genocide.' Meiner pressured O Cinema to cancel the screenings, and while the theater initially announced its cancellation, it later reversed course and proceeded with showings as scheduled. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In response, Meiner said he would introduce legislation to terminate the theater's lease — since it operates in a city-owned building — and withdraw the remaining municipal funding. The city commission is set to discuss the proposal next week. The move drew criticism from various groups, including the Florida chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which called it an attack on free speech and censorship. 'The government does not get to pick and choose which viewpoints the public is allowed to hear, however controversial some might find them,' Daniel Tilley, the organization's legal director, said. City Commissioner Kristen Rosen Gonzalez also voiced concerns. While she agreed with Meiner's stance on the film, she warned of costly legal consequences. 'The city could find itself facing costly legal battles,' she wrote in a newsletter to residents. Gonzalez suggested that instead of revoking O Cinema’s lease, the city should also screen films presenting a different perspective, such as 'Screams Before Silence', a documentary by filmmaker Anat Stilinsky and produced by Sheryl Sandberg, which tells the story of Israeli women sexually assaulted by Hamas terrorists on October 7, 2023. Meiner’s position, however, has strong support among some community leaders. City Commissioner David Suarez declared, 'Unlike other cities, we have zero tolerance for pro-Hamas or anti-Israel propaganda. Miami Beach is home to many Holocaust survivors and we stand firm — never again.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1vrmhl2kl	2025-03-13T12:37:34-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/03/SyuJE3GjJx/SyuJE3GjJx_0_49_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
October 7 blueprint: Seized Hamas memos outline path to Israel’s ...	Terror group’s documents expose detailed plans for attack on Israel, coordination with Iran and Hezbollah and strategies to exploit Jewish holidays for large-scale attacks, according to IDF analysis Captured Hamas military wing documents uncovered by the IDF in Gaza reveal the terror group's preparations for a large-scale war with Israel, particularly an attack similar to the October 7 massacre referred to by Hamas as the 'Al-Aqsa Flood.' The documents outline Hamas's vision for the 'destruction of Israel' and its operational plans to achieve this goal. A report by Israel’s Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center details Hamas's post-2021 strategy to turn its vision into an actionable plan, noting a shift in its approach to Israel’s destruction in the near term. 'This change is evident in public statements by Hamas leaders, though they may have been dismissed in Israel as empty boasts,' the report read. Hamas' 1988 charter explicitly calls for Israel's destruction and the establishment of an Islamic state over all of Mandated Palestine. In 2017, Hamas published a revised policy document with softened rhetoric but maintained its long-term objective. One captured Hamas military document details its 2013-2017 strategy, which later materialized in the October 7, 2023, attack. It includes objectives such as strengthening Gaza’s resistance structure, securing prisoner exchanges, mobilizing Arab and Islamic forces for jihad and targeting IDF personnel in international forums. Another memo from former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s office, dated January 2019, discusses Hamas relations with Iran, stressing a joint defense pact with Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Quds Force and Hezbollah in preparation for an all-front war against Israel. After the 2021 conflict with Hamas, Sinwar and other Palestinian officials sent a letter to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, belittling Israel’s strength. 'This imagined entity is weaker than people think. With Allah’s help, and with your support, we can uproot and eliminate it soon,' they wrote. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In June 2022, Sinwar outlined a strategic war plan in a letter to former Hamas politburo chief Ismail Haniyeh, describing an initial phase involving Hamas, Hezbollah and other terror groups launching a surprise attack from all fronts to 'topple and eliminate the occupying state.' He stressed that 'Al-Aqsa and Jerusalem must be the focal points of the campaign' and suggested timing attacks around Jewish holidays to maximize impact. Sinwar also proposed a secondary scenario aimed at weakening Israel’s capabilities and morale, undermining its regional alliances and inciting uprisings in the West Bank and within Israel. A third scenario would see Hamas, Hezbollah and allied forces from Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Jordan executing a full-scale assault. Hezbollah’s former leader Hassan Nasrallah reportedly supported the first scenario, believing it was realistic and could lead to Israel’s destruction. Additional Hamas documents reveal discussions with Hezbollah and Iran about escalating hostilities. In an April 2023 exchange, Sinwar assured a senior Hezbollah commander that any future battle would make the 2021 war in Gaza seem like 'a walk in the park for the enemy.' A separate July 2023 memo summarized Hamas delegations' meetings in Iran, where officials described Gaza as 'the base of the resistance' and stressed preparing for regional escalation. 'Gaza must be prepared in case of a major campaign for Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa, and we believe this is a strategic matter on the path to defeating the Zionist entity,' Hamas’s memo from the meeting in Iran read. 'We are always discussing with all relevant parties how such a campaign should be conducted. We in Palestine affirm that we are ready, will be at the forefront of this expected confrontation and will not hesitate to defend our people, Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa.' The findings provide further insight into Hamas's long-term strategy and coordination with Iran and Hezbollah, reinforcing its commitment to prolonged and intensified conflict with Israel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryp8liehje	2025-03-13T12:22:13-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/17/rJfgHTRyJe/rJfgHTRyJe_0_210_1689_951_0_small.jpg

Brigadier General Rodolphe Haykal is appointed by the Beirut Government to take charge of the implementation of UN Resolution 1701 and the deployment of his forces to the south Israel struck Hezbollah weapons production and storage facilities in the Beqaa Valley on Thursday, the IDF said in a statement. The military said Israeli attacks would continue ' in order to remove any threat to the State of Israel.' Reports in Lebanon claimed the IDF also attacked areas near the Lebanese border with Syria. Earlier Lebanon announced the appointment of Brigadier General Rodolphe Haykal as the new commander of the. He will be charged with the implementation of UN Resolution 1701 and the deployment of the Lebanese army to the south. In his last position, Haykal was commandeer of the area south of the Litani River, where Hezbollah forces were entrenched. The government also approved the conscription of 4,500 new soldiers. According to the Hezbollah-affiliated Al Akhbar newspaper, Lebanon's Defense Minister Michel Menassa will request that the army increase its forces by 1,500 soldiers a year over the next three years.

Family of Israeli researcher kidnapped in Iraq expresses renewed ...	Emma Tsurkov says she has been in contact with U.S. officials in efforts to secure Elizabeth's release after the previous administration did not do enough to hold the Iraqi government accountable Emma Tsurkov, whose sister Elizabeth, an Israeli researcher, was kidnapped in Iraq nearly two years ago, expressed cautious optimism that renewed U.S. diplomatic efforts could lead to her release. Speaking to Ynet in an interview, she said she has been in contact with U.S. officials who she they have been actively engaged in efforts to secure her sister’s freedom. 'I’ve had the fortune of speaking with Adam Boehler more than once, and I’ve also met with his staff. They have been incredibly kind, compassionate, and patient,' she said. 'I’ve been reassured that getting my sister out is a top priority, and they are fully engaged in working toward that goal.' Elizabeth Tsurkov, a Princeton University doctoral student, was conducting research in Iraq when she was kidnapped by Kataeb Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia that is part of Iraq’s security forces. Tsurkov criticized the previous U.S. administration for what she described as a lack of willingness to hold the Iraqi government accountable. 'My sister was kidnapped by a terror group that is also part of the Iraqi armed forces. Iraq is an ally of the United States, and yet there was no effort to hold the Iraqis accountable,' she said. 'That has changed with this new administration, and it feels refreshing.'

While confirming that Elizabeth is alive, Emma Tsurkov expressed deep concern for her sister’s health, noting that she was abducted just days after undergoing emergency spinal surgery in Baghdad. 'She was facing months of physical therapy, which, of course, is impossible under these conditions,' she said. Despite the uncertainty, she said she is more hopeful now than at any time since her sister's disappearance.

Iran defies Trump, advances nuclear program amid sanctions	Since President Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal during his first term, the regime has significantly advanced its nuclear program After the Trump administration sent a letter to Ayatollah Khamenei seeking nuclear negotiations, no progress has been made toward a dialogue on Iran’s illicit nuclear program. Since President Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal during his first term, the regime has significantly advanced its nuclear program, exceeding the regulations stipulated in the original agreement. Experts estimate that Iran could be just weeks away from developing a nuclear weapon based on its uranium enrichment reaching weapons-grade levels. The regime’s actions have also raised alarm in the UN Security Council, which has called an urgent meeting this week to address Iran’s stockpiles of highly enriched uranium—materials with no civilian purpose—and Tehran’s continued failure to fully cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). As Iran accelerates its nuclear ambitions, Trump has repeatedly stated that he prefers a verified nuclear deal over war but has warned that military action remains on the table if the regime continues on its current path. On Tuesday, Iranian President Massoud Pezeshkian reaffirmed Ayatollah Khamenei’s earlier statement that the regime will not negotiate with Trump, whom they labeled a 'bully,' declaring that the U.S. president should 'do whatever the hell he wants.' The statement came after Trump reimposed maximum pressure sanctions, including ending a waiver that previously allowed Iraq to purchase electricity from Iran. Meanwhile, the regime held joint military drills with Russia and China this week. The Islamic Republic has a long-standing grudge against Trump and has even attempted to assassinate him multiple times during the election season. As sanctions continue to squeeze the regime, Israel and the United States are working closely to ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hynch5e21g	2025-03-13T10:00:58-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2012/05/26/3948276/3948276_0_0_1000_800_0_small.jpg

Putin backs US ceasefire idea for Ukraine, but says many details ...	Russian leader says truce would have to deal with 'root causes' of the conflict and critical details still unresolved; Witkoff in Moscow to meet Putin while at the White House Trump says he hopes the Russians do the right thing President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia agreed with U.S. proposals for a ceasefire in Ukraine, but that any truce would have to deal with the root causes of the conflict and that many crucial details needed to be sorted out. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 has left hundreds of thousands of dead and injured, displaced millions of people, reduced towns to rubble and triggered the sharpest confrontation between Moscow and the West in decades. Putin's support - though caveated - for the U.S. ceasefire proposal offers the best chance so far to end the biggest conflict in Europe since World War Two as Ukraine had also agreed to the proposal at talks earlier in the week. 'We agree with the proposals to cease hostilities,' Putin told reporters at a news conference in the Kremlin following talks with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. 'The idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it. But we proceed from the fact that this cessation should be such that it would lead to long-term peace and would eliminate the original causes of this crisis.' Putin thanked U.S. President Donald Trump, who says he wants to be remembered as a peacemaker, for his efforts to end the war, which both Moscow and Washington now cast as a deadly proxy war that could have escalated into World War Three. Russia Advancing Russian forces have been advancing since mid-2024 and control nearly a fifth of Ukraine's territory. Putin said Russian forces were moving forward along the entire frontline and said the ceasefire would have to ensure that Ukraine did not seek to simply use it to regroup. 'How can we and how will we be guaranteed that nothing like this will happen? How will control (of the ceasefire) be organised?' Putin said. 'These are all serious questions. There are issues that we need to discuss. And I think we need to talk to our American colleagues as well.' > Putin said he might call Trump to discuss the issue. Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff was in Moscow and expected to meet with the Russian president. 'Hopefully they'll do the right thing,' Trump told reporters during an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. After 9 hours of discussions in Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday, Washington and Kiev announced that Ukraine agreed to a temporary cease-fire with Russia and that the U.S. would resume the provision of military aid and intelligence to Ukraine. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkemwcl31e	2025-03-13T09:28:00-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/07/H1BPotqZyg/H1BPotqZyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
‘I’m overwhelmed, an emotional rollercoaster’: IDF presents aresi...	Military and outgoing IDF chief Halevi apologize for systemic failure during the October 7 massacre on the kibbutz where one in four residents was killed or kidnapped, as survivors and bereaved families demand accountability and answers The IDF on Thursday presented residents of Kibbutz Nir Oz with its findings in the investigation into the October 7 Hamas massacre on the kibbutz, which suffered the results of the military’s most severe failures. One in four residents was either kidnapped or murdered and no military forces arrived or engaged in combat there until 1 p.m. hours after the terrorists invaded. Former IDF chief of staff Herzi Halevi and outgoing IDF Southern Command chief Yaron Finkelman were in attendance. 'We salute you. The alert squad is supposed to handle a small problem for a short time until the IDF arrives quickly – and we didn't arrive,' Halevi said. Maj. Gen. (res.) Eran Niv, who headed the probe was also there and he too began his presentation with an apology. Residents were required to leave their phones at the entrance to the hall where they gathered to hear the inquiry's conclusions. Mental health professionals were stationed outside to provide support. Among those present were former hostages from the kibbutz, including Gadi Mozes, Adina Moshe, Nili Margalit, Tami Metzger, Ada Sagi and Margalit Moses. 'It didn’t tell us much new. They were completely open and kept apologizing. They said, 'We failed,' — and that word came up 13 times,' a Nir Oz resident told Ynet. 'There’s a lot of anger and tough questions from the residents. I feel awful, but they’re answering all our questions. They’re telling us everything they know, but they can only provide information about themselves — we need a state commission of inquiry.' Daniel Lifshitz, grandson of former hostage Oded Lifshitz, who was murdered in captivity and whose remains were returned to Israel, said before the meeting began that the main question was why no one came to Nir Oz. 'We need the names of those responsible for this catastrophe. I want to see full accountability,' he said. 'It's important to finish this investigation and keep up the pressure to bring the hostages home. We just want to understand what happened — how is it possible that our internal security team fought for hours against hundreds of terrorists when they were trained for, at most, a 15-minute battle against a few dozen? There’s a huge gap here that needs serious answers.' Yael Eder, mother of Tamir Eder, who fought in the kibbutz’s alert squad, was murdered, and kidnapped, told Ynet she wanted to know that former chief of staff Halevi remains committed to securing her son’s return. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Even after they resign, they must stay committed as citizens. My children didn’t get to say goodbye to him and he needs to be brought back so they can. That’s the duty of the Israeli government and everyone who was in office on October 7.' She said she told Halevi at the end of the six-and-a-half-hour briefing that if her son is not brought home, 'all of this was for nothing.' Halevi responded that Tamir's actions weren’t in vain because the local squad saved lives. 'It was important that they didn’t shy away from the discussion. They stood there, spoke honestly and apologized,' Natan Bahat, one of the kibbutz founders, said. 'They admitted it was a systemic failure, a mindset. They kept repeating the word ‘failure.’' Nir Oz, which was left completely unprotected during Hamas’s surprise attack, was at the center of the assault on Gaza border communities. Hundreds of terrorists stormed the kibbutz and occupied it for hours. By the time IDF forces first arrived, there was no one left to save. The terrorists and looters had already left after and there was no battle between the IDF and the terrorists, unlike in other communities. The death toll was devastating: 57 people were murdered, including at least seven who were kidnapped alive and murdered in captivity. Some 76 were abducted and five hostages from Nir Oz remain alive in captivity: Eitan Horn, Matan Zangauker, David and Ariel Cunio and a Thai national. Nine of the Nir Oz residents who were murdered in captivity are Judih Weinstein Hagga, Aryeh Zalmanovich, Eliyahu Margalit, Gadi Hagi, Yair Yaakov, Ronen Engel, Aviv Atzili, Tamir Eder and Amiram Cooper. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkh7o00ghjx	2025-03-13T08:51:21-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/20/H1jT11tkf6/H1jT11tkf6_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Iran protests UN closed-door meeting on its nuclear program	Envoys of the UK, France and Germany are summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Tehran after the regime claims of 'misuse of the UN Security Council' and British threats to impose UN sanctions on Iran Iran's foreign ministry on Thursday summoned the envoys of Britain, France and Germany over what it called a 'misuse of the U.N. Security Council to hold a closed-door meeting' over Tehran's nuclear program, Iranian state media reported. The closed-door meeting at the U.N. was called by six of the Security Council's 15 members - the U.S., France, Greece, Panama, South Korea and Britain. Britain warned on Wednesday that it would trigger a return of U.N. sanctions on Iran, if needed, to prevent it from getting a nuclear weapon as the Security Council met to discuss Tehran's expansion of its stock of uranium that is close to weapons grade. Iran has denied wanting to develop a nuclear weapon and says its nuclear programme is peaceful. However, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has warned that its production of uranium enriched to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% weapons-grade level, has recently jumped. Western states say there is no need to enrich uranium to such a high level under any civilian program and that no other country has done so without producing nuclear bombs. The U.S. mission to the U.N. said in a statement after the Council meeting that Iran was 'the only country in the world without nuclear weapons producing highly enriched uranium, for which it has no credible peaceful purpose.' > On Wednesday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appeared to dismiss a U.S. proposal for negotiating over its nuclear programme.

After talking to Hamas US hostage negotiator removed	According to sources Adam Boehler is no longer involved in efforts to release the Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza or Elizabeth Tsurkov abducted in 2023 in Baghdad U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy on hostages, Adam Boehler, has been moved from dealing with the Israeli captives held by Hamas, according to senior sources in Washington. There has been no official announcement yet, and the decision could be reversed at the last moment. Boehler's removal follows Israel's campaign against the backchannel talks he held with the heads of Hamas in Doha, aimed at securing the release of American hostages. After they were revealed – according to American sources by Israelis – they were suspended. Israel was at first ignorant of the talks and later opposed to them. To explain his attempt born of the stalemate in negotiations, Boehler gave interviews to Israeli media outlets and further enraged American officials after he described the Hamas officials as nice people and had to apologize. According to the reports, he will be removed from the efforts to release the 59 hostages held in Gaza and the attempts to bring about the release of Elizabeth Tsurkov who was abducted in Iraq in 2023. He will for now, continue to be responsible for efforts to free thousands of American hostages and prisoners. > Boehler's removal leaves Steve Witkoff as the sole senior official dealing with Israel's hostages.

Netanyahu to visit Hungary despite ICC arrest warrant	Visit to come after invitation by Hungarian PM Orban last November, saying he would guarantee arrest warrant over Israel's alleged war crimes abuses in Gaza would 'not be observed' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will pay an official visit to Hungary in the next few weeks, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's chief of staff said on Thursday, in defiance of an international arrest warrant for the Israeli leader. Orban invited Netanyahu to visit Hungary last November, saying he would guarantee that an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant, issued a day earlier over Israel's alleged war crimes abuses in Gaza, would 'not be observed'. 'According to current plans will arrive before Easter. Once the date of the visit is confirmed, we will, of course, announce it, taking into account the extremely important security considerations in this case,' Gergely Gulyas told a news conference. Easter Sunday falls on April 20 this year. Several other European nations have said Netanyahu would be detained if he set foot on their soil. All European Union member states, including Hungary, are members of the ICC, which means they are required to enforce its warrants. Orban, a right-wing nationalist, has often been at odds with the EU over democratic standards and human rights in Hungary.

Israel sends humanitarian aid to Druze in Syria	Foreign Ministry says over 10,000 packages of humanitarian aid have been transfered to southern province of Suwayda Israel has sent humanitarian aid to Druze communities in Syria over the past few weeks, the Foreign Ministry said on Thursday, in a further sign of Israel's support for the minority group. 'In an operation conducted over the past few weeks, 10,000 packages of humanitarian aid were thus far delivered to the Druze community in the battle areas of Syria,' the foreign ministry said in a statement. The packages included basic goods like oil, flour, salt and sugar, and were mostly delivered to the southern province of Suwayda, the Foreign Ministry said. The Druze, an Arab minority present in Syria, Israel, the Israeli Golan Heights and Lebanon, practise a faith that originated in Islam but which has a distinct identity. In Israel, many Druze serve in the military, including in the war in Gaza, and some have reached senior ranks. Since the ouster of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Israeli leaders have expressed deep mistrust of the new Syrian government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa, describing his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) movement as a Jihadist group. HTS was affiliated with extremist group Al Qaeda but later renounced the connection. Israel has called for the rights of Syrian minority groups including the Druze to be protected. This week, Defence Minister Israel Katz said Syrian Druze would be allowed to enter and work in the Golan Heights. A group of around 100 senior figures from Syria's Druze are also expected to visit the Golan Heights on Friday, members of the community said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj0xgeehye	2025-03-13T02:18:38-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/13/BJmOQbQeh1x/BJmOQbQeh1x_0_80_1280_721_0_small.jpg
US envoy Witkoff arrives in Moscow for Ukraine cease-fire talks	Moscow's advances along front in recent months and Trump's attempt to strike peace deal to end three-year-old conflict have raised fears that Kyiv, which was backed by the West, could lose the war Russian President Vladimir Putin, dressed in military fatigues, ordered the swift defeat of Ukrainian forces in western Russia, a signal to the United States that Moscow holds the military initiative as they prepare to discuss a cease-fire on Thursday. Russia's advances along the front in recent months and U.S. President Donald Trump's attempt to strike a peace deal to end the three-year-old conflict in Ukraine have raised fears that Kyiv, which was backed by the West, could lose the war. Trump's Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Moscow on Thursday to meet Putin. Russian officials said U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz had provided details on the cease-fire idea on Wednesday and Russia was ready to discuss it. Trump had said in the White House on Wednesday that he hoped the Kremlin would agree to the U.S. proposal for a 30-day cease-fire that Ukraine said it would support. Just hours after Trump spoke, the Kremlin published footage of Putin dressed in a green camouflage uniform visiting the Kursk region of western Russia where Ukraine is set to lose its foothold after a lightning offensive by Russian forces. 'Our task in the near future, in the shortest possible timeframe, is to decisively defeat the enemy entrenched in the Kursk region,' said Putin, a former KGB officer who very rarely wears military uniform. 'And of course, we need to think about creating a security zone along the state border,' said Putin. He did not mention the cease-fire idea. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 has left hundreds of thousands of dead and injured, displaced millions of people, reduced towns to rubble and triggered the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West in six decades. In an attempt to divert Russian forces from eastern Ukraine, gain a bargaining chip and embarrass Putin, Ukraine smashed across the border into the Kursk region in August, the biggest attack on Russian territory since the Nazi invasion of 1941. Ukraine now has a sliver of less than 200 square km (77 square miles) in Kursk, down from 1,300 square km (500 square miles) at the peak of the incursion last summer, according to the Russian military. Cease-fire? Putin is due on Thursday to hold talks in Moscow with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and then give a joint news conference, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The United States agreed on Tuesday to resume weapons supplies and intelligence sharing with Ukraine after Kyiv said at talks in Saudi Arabia that it was ready to support a cease-fire proposal. 'It's up to Russia now,' Trump said on Wednesday, saying that he hoped the 'bloodbath' of the war would end. 'And if we can get Russia to stop, then we have a full cease-fire. And I think it'll never go back to war.' Two senior Russian sources told Reuters that Putin would seek to carve out assurances and guarantees before agreeing to any cease-fire. Another senior Moscow source said that Putin would agree to the truce but seek to add his own terms on what should happen after the cease-fire. Beyond the immediate cease-fire idea, Russia has presented the U.S. with a list of demands for a deal to end its war against Ukraine and reset relations with Washington, according to two people familiar with the matter. The Kremlin declined to comment directly on that report but said there was a huge amount of incorrect information being published by the media. In June, Putin set out his terms for peace: Ukraine must officially drop its NATO ambitions and withdraw its troops from the entirety of four Ukrainian regions claimed and mostly controlled by Russia, which holds just under a fifth of Ukraine. Russia is advancing swiftly in Kursk. The Defence Ministry said on Thursday that the town of Sudzha had been taken by Russia. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine, which had on Wednesday reported that fighting was still ongoing. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of Russia's General Staff, said Ukraine's plans to use Kursk as a bargaining chip in possible future negotiations with Russia had failed and its gambit that its Kursk operation would force Russia to divert troops from its advance in eastern Ukraine had also not worked. He said Russian forces had retaken 24 settlements and 259 square km (100 square miles) of land from Ukrainian forces in the last five days along with over 400 prisoners. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sypba7x3kl	2025-03-13T02:14:06-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/07/H1BPotqZyg/H1BPotqZyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

IDF veterans with PTSD call for firecracker-free Purim: 'It paral...	Military veterans describe how firecrackers trigger severe anxiety, flashbacks and distress, sometimes taking days to recover, urging parents to educate children on impact 'When I hear firecrackers, my heart drops to the floor. I'm certain there's a terror attack. It's a kind of panic that paralyzes me and it takes me back. An incident like this can send me straight to bed, in hysteria, crying and needing sedatives. It can take me days to return to my routine. This is how I’ve been living for 20 years.' This is how Keren Chizik, 40, from Ra'anana, described the impact of loud Purim firecrackers, including fireworks, cap guns and other noise-making accessories, on herself and many others who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Chizik served as a combat medic in the Gaza border region, where she experienced hundreds of traumatic incidents that left her struggling with PTSD. 'We were called to incidents almost every day,' she recalled. 'There were many terrorist infiltrations and constant gunfire. There was no Red Alert rocket warning system back then. We were constantly responding to emergencies and seeing the wounded. A few months after my discharge, I started experiencing PTSD symptoms. Today, I’m diagnosed with severe, complex and chronic PTSD. 'Eight years ago, I was introduced to the concept of service dogs for PTSD and I became involved in the field. Now, I have a service dog — one of the first in Israel — and she has completely changed my life.' Chizik, mother to a 10-year-old boy, believes that children can understand the impact of firecrackers. 'Kids at this age are well aware of what's happening in the country,' she explained. 'It's absolutely possible to explain to them that these explosive Purim accessories frighten everyone — especially after October 7. It affects heroic soldiers who defended our country. It paralyzes us. So why is it necessary? We can do without it.' 'Every boom takes me back to war' Alon Katz, 39, from Haifa, also suffers from PTSD. During his military service, he participated in various operations and fought in the Second Lebanon War. 'I was in combat situations that were extremely complex,' he said. 'I was discharged in 2007 and soon after, I began experiencing troubling behaviors. Two years later, the PTSD symptoms hit hard—I started having panic attacks and other issues I had never faced before.' Katz remembers firecrackers being popular during Purim when he was a child. 'Back then, the loud booms were cool, but today, it’s different. Every sudden explosion in the middle of the day brings back the smell of gunpowder and takes me straight back to war. I instantly start scanning for terrorists or explosives. I feel like I'm in a battlefield, on high alert, making sure there's no threat around me. It’s like being transported back 20 years—to a checkpoint, hearing explosions from all directions. It’s like walking down the street and suddenly smelling Lebanon.' 'It can take me a month to recover' According to Katz, it takes him a long time to recover after hearing a firecracker explosion. 'For a child, throwing a firecracker takes a second. But for me, it takes hours to calm down. What sets us apart—those of us with PTSD—from the rest of the population is that our injury makes us react physically differently to our surroundings. It completely throws you off balance. The ability to regulate yourself afterward, to calm down, can take hours. It’s not fair. Why should I have to suffer for hours? Why should I be in this situation? We’re already in a difficult time—we’re at war.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Katz believes education is key. 'I'm speaking to children, but also to parents. Please consider us—the ones who were there for you, protecting you and your children, so you can go to work, to school and live your lives. We deserve to be treated with respect and to live as normal a life as possible because we already face so many challenges. Firecrackers make it even harder for us.' 'I instantly go into high alert' Kobi Levy, 36, from Ashdod, also suffers from combat-related PTSD. 'Every time a firecracker goes off, I panic and immediately go into a state of extreme alertness, as if my finger is on the trigger,' he explained. 'Last year, it took me nearly a month to recover from an incident like this. I’m really asking and hoping that this year, Purim will be completely firecracker-free. It would make a huge difference for us.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rjylrxxh1l	2025-03-12T23:26:29-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/13/HkxDZbxl21x/HkxDZbxl21x_0_42_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Tayibe resident Kamel Nashaf is suspected of filiming security forces en route to West Bank's Tulkarm and sharing footage via Telegram to help terrorists prepare for their arrival Israeli police and the Shin Bet have arrested Kamel Nashaf, a 21-year-old from Tayibe, suspected of pledging allegiance to ISIS and collaborating with terrorist operatives. Amid the ongoing war in Gaza, Nashaf allegedly sought to 'avenge' Israel by assisting terror groups in the West Bank. According to the investigation, Nashaf filmed security forces en route to Tulkarm and shared the footage via Telegram to help terrorists prepare for their arrival. An indictment against him is set to be filed today. Authorities say Nashaf began consuming ISIS-related content on social media last summer and eventually made direct contact with operatives affiliated with the group.

Columbia U protest leader to remain in detention, won't be deport...	Mahmoud Khalil's pregnant wife says she was naive to think his Green Card would save him from arrest, says he is helping other detained migrants with poor English fill out forms; 'It would be devastating for him to meet his first child behind a glass screen' Two days before U.S. agents arrested Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University student and Palestinian activist asked his wife if she knew what to do if immigration agents came to their door. Noor Abdalla, Khalil's wife of more than two years, said she was confused. As a legal permanent resident of the U.S., surely Khalil did not have to worry about that, she recalls telling him. 'I didn't take him seriously. Clearly I was naive,' Abdalla, a U.S. citizen who is eight months pregnant, told Reuters Wednesday in her first media interview. A U.S. judge on Wednesday extended his order blocking federal authorities from deporting Khalil, in a case that has become a flashpoint of the Trump administration's pledge to deport some pro-Palestinian college activists. U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman had temporarily blocked Khalil's deportation earlier this week, and extended the prohibition on Wednesday in a written order following a hearing in Manhattan federal court to allow himself more time to consider whether the arrest was unconstitutional. The Department of Homeland Security says Khalil, 30, is subject to deportation under a legal provision holding that migrants whose presence in the country are deemed by the U.S. Secretary of State to be incompatible with foreign policy may be removed, according to a document seen by Reuters. Homeland Security agents handcuffed him on Saturday in the lobby of their university-owned apartment building in Manhattan. Earlier on Wednesday, Abdalla, a 28-year-old dentist in New York, sat in the front row of a Manhattan courtroom as Khalil's lawyers argued to a federal judge that he had been arrested in retaliation for his outspoken advocacy against Israel's military assault on Gaza following the militant group Hamas' October 2023 attack. They told the judge that was a violation of Khalil's constitutional free speech rights. Trump has said, without evidence, that Khalil, 30, has promoted Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group that governs Gaza. His administration has said Khalil is not accused of or charged with a crime, but Trump says his presence in the U.S. is 'contrary to national and foreign policy interests.' On Sunday, the Trump administration transferred Khalil from a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement jail in Elizabeth, New Jersey, near Manhattan, to a jail in rural Jena, Louisiana, about 1,200 miles (2,000 km) away. Abdalla and Khalil met in Lebanon in 2016 when she joined a volunteer program Khalil was overseeing at a non-profit group that provides educational scholarships to Syrian youth. They started as friends before a seven-year long-distance relationship led to their New York wedding in 2023. The couple are expecting their first child in late April. She said she hoped Khalil would be free by then. She showed Reuters a picture of a recent sonogram: a boy whose name they have yet to choose. 'I think it would be very devastating for me and for him to meet his first child behind a glass screen,' Abdalla said, adding that Khalil had insisted on doing all the cooking, laundry and cleaning through her pregnancy. 'I've always been so excited to have my first baby with the person I love.' The government has said it has begun proceedings to deport Khalil and is defending his detention in the court proceedings until then. Trump has called the anti-Israel student protest movement antisemitic and said Khalil's 'is the first arrest of many to come.' > Khalil was born and raised in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria and came to the U.S. on a student visa in 2022, getting his U.S. permanent residency green card last year. He completed his studies at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs in December but is yet to receive his master's degree diploma. He became a high-profile member of the Ivy League university's student protest movement, often speaking to the media as one of the lead negotiators with Columbia administration over the protesters' years-long demands that the school end investments of its $14.8 billion endowment in weapons makers and other companies that support Israel's government. The Trump administration says pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses, including Columbia, have included support for Hamas, which the U.S. has designated as a terrorist organization, and antisemitic harassment of Jewish students. Student protest organizers say criticism of Israel is being wrongly conflated with antisemitism. Jewish faculty at Columbia held a rally and press conference in support of Khalil outside a university building on Monday, holding signs saying 'Jews say no to deportations.' But Abdalla said no one from Columbia's administration had contacted her to offer help, which she found frustrating. She said her husband's focus was on supporting his community through advocacy and in more direct ways.

Israeli Arab indicted for joining ISIS, providing terrorists with...	State prosecutors are set to file an indictment against Kamel Nashaf, a 21-year-old resident of Tayibe, on suspicion of engaging in terrorist activity inspired by ISIS. According to the allegations, Nashaf pledged allegiance to the terrorist organization and provided information on security forces' operations to terrorists in the West Bank. Police and the Shin Bet said the suspect had consumed ISIS-related content on social media and had even contacted operatives affiliated with the group. The investigation also revealed that Nashaf filmed security forces on their way to Tulkarm and passed the information on to terrorists in the area.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by11xsegh1g	2025-03-12T22:32:46-07:00

Rights groups say Trump used term Palestinian as slur in referenc...	U.S. Muslim and Jewish advocacy groups criticized President Donald Trump on Wednesday for referring to the top Senate Democrat, Senator Chuck Schumer, as a Palestinian, with the organizations saying the president used the term as a slur. Trump, a Republican, was asked by reporters at the White House about U.S. corporate tax rate policy during an Oval Office meeting with Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martin, and in response expressed displeasure with congressional Democrats not supporting his agenda. 'Schumer is a Palestinian as far as I'm concerned. He's become a Palestinian. He used to be Jewish. He's not Jewish anymore. He's a Palestinian,' Trump said. Schumer is the highest-ranking elected U.S. Jewish official and is not of Palestinian heritage. 'President Trump's use of the term 'Palestinian' as a racial slur is offensive and beneath the dignity of his office,' said Nihad Awad, national executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations. Awad, who is of Palestinian heritage, said Trump's comments showed the 'continuing dehumanization' of Palestinians. Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, also condemned Trump's remarks, as did Halie Soifer, CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rybssje2ye	2025-03-12T21:23:54-07:00

During the event, they repeatedly interrupted speakers until they were removed from the hall by security guards.

Is Mike Huckabee's Israel ambassadorship in Jeopardy?	Exclusive: Huckabee's senate confirmation hearing has been delayed until March 25 The Senate confirmation hearing for Gov. Mike Huckabee to become the U.S. ambassador to Israel was delayed once again—this time from March 13 to March 25. According to sources close to the Trump administration, the postponement was driven by Democratic opposition and pressure from the liberal Jewish community, adding another layer of controversy to his appointment. 'The Democrats will do everything possible to delay the hearing,' said Friends of Zion founder Mike Evans. After learning of the delay, Evans wrote a letter to all members of the Senate in support of Huckabee’s nomination. That letter was disseminated on Tuesday. Huckabee was among the first appointments announced by U.S. President Donald Trump after his election. The Senate officially received his nomination on February 11, 2025. In his letter, Evans wrote that Huckabee has 'been criticized for being a Christian Zionist. In fact, he is a Christian Zionist, and I am also, as are more than 50 million Bible-believing Americans.' He further stated, 'Israel has been weakened by Jew haters who have used the Palestinians as proxies. To weaken Israel is to destabilize the Middle East and risk the peace of the world, for the road to world peace runs through the Middle East.' Evans praised Huckabee as a man of 'moral clarity' and emphasized that 'if there was ever a time Israel needed a U.S. ambassador whose foundation is a support of Zionism and moral clarity, it is now.' Evans’ letter follows a contrasting message sent to Congress nearly three weeks earlier by the Union for Reform Judaism and the Central Conference of American Rabbis. In their letter, these groups expressed deep concerns over Huckabee’s nomination, citing his opposition to a Palestinian state and his Christian theology. The rabbis reminded senators that in 2008, as a presidential candidate, Huckabee stated, 'There’s really no such thing as a Palestinian.' They also pointed out that in 2017, 'Huckabee denied the reality of Israel’s decades-long occupation of the West Bank.' More recently, in an interview with Israel Radio following his nomination, the former governor welcomed the possibility of Israeli annexation of Judea and Samaria. 'Gov. Huckabee’s views may be shaped in significant part by his deeply held evangelical faith, including what is known as ‘Christian Zionism,’' the letter reads. 'This ideology professes a love of Israel rooted in the belief that Jewish sovereignty over the biblical land of Israel will hasten the return of Jesus Christ. Gov. Huckabee can hold whatever faith views he believes. At the same time, as Jews and Zionists, we are gravely concerned by a teaching in which the well-being of Jews, of Israel, and of America are not ends in themselves but means to the fulfillment of Christian eschatology.' Ynet News reached out to several Democratic senators for comment, but none responded. The outlet also contacted the director of strategic communications for the Union for Reform Judaism and a representative of the liberal J Street organization. J Street stated that it would look into the matter. Evans told Ynet that he does not believe the Senate will ultimately block Huckabee’s appointment but emphasized that Israel urgently needs an ambassador. He warned that the delay is detrimental to ongoing war efforts and efforts to bring hostages home. If confirmed, Huckabee would be the first Evangelical Christian to serve as U.S. ambassador to Israel. In recent decades, most ambassadors to Israel have been Jewish, including Trump’s previous ambassador, David Friedman. This is a developing story.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1t11hjx3ke	2025-03-12T20:58:16-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2014/06/25/5413490/5413490_1_0_1024_576_0_small.jpg
Targeted Israeli facilities: US sanctions notorious Swedish gang ...	Trump administration imposes sanctions on Sweden’s Foxtrot Network and its leader, alleging Iranian intelligence collaboration in attacks on Israeli embassies and Jewish targets amid escalating Gaza war tensions The United States on Wednesday announced sanctions against the Foxtrot Network, a Sweden-based gang accused of carrying out attacks against Israeli interests in Europe on behalf of Iran. Describing Foxtrot as one of Sweden's 'most notorious criminal gangs,' the U.S. Treasury and State Departments also placed sanctions on its leader Rawa Majid, with both agencies saying in statements that he had 'specifically cooperated with the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security.' The network, primarily based in Sweden, is involved in drug smuggling and has carried out violent attacks on Israeli and Jewish targets in Europe. In January 2024, it planned and executed an attack on the Israeli embassy in Stockholm on behalf of the Iranian government. Four months later, gunshots were fired near the same embassy, and a week later, 'Airsoft' grenades were thrown into the courtyard of the Israeli embassy in Belgium. 'Iran's brazen use of transnational criminal organizations and narcotics traffickers underscores the regime's attempts to achieve its aims through any means, with no regard for the cost to communities across Europe,' Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said. The sanctions, which usually include asset freezes and US entry bans, were issued in line with President Donald Trump's reinstated 'maximum pressure' campaign against Iran, the agencies said. Sweden's Sapo intelligence service announced last May that it believed Iran had recruited Swedish criminal gang members as proxies to commit 'acts of violence' against Israeli and other interests in Sweden. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: That announcement came weeks after nighttime gunfire was reported outside Israel's embassy in Stockholm, and three months after police found a live grenade lying on the grounds of the Israeli compound. At the time, Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter (DN) reported that both Majid's Foxtrot and arch-rival gang Rumba had been recruited by the Iranian regime, citing documents from Israel's intelligence agency Mossad. DN said the Mossad documents showed Majid -- a Swedish-Turkish dual national nicknamed the 'Kurdish Fox' -- had been arrested in Iran and ordered to cooperate with the Iranian regime or go to jail. Later, in October, the embassy was hit by gunfire, while the day after two explosions occurred near the Israeli embassy in Copenhagen. Swedish nationals have been arrested over the suspected grenade attack, according to Danish police. The attacks in Europe last year occurred as tensions soared between Iran and Israel over the devastating war in Gaza. But Sweden has struggled to contain surging gang violence in recent years, with shootings and bombings now frequently occurring across the country. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1r8ef13kl	2025-03-12T14:42:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/05/30/BJsEGXIVC/BJsEGXIVC_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Putin visits front in fatigues as Trump pushes for cease-fire	Russia boasts military gains while Kremlin says it awaits details from D.C. on proposed 30-day truce in war with Ukraine; Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson says her country will make its own decisions The Kremlin said on Wednesday it was awaiting details from Washington about a proposal for a 30-day cease-fire in Ukraine before responding, while U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio hoped a deal would be struck within days. As Moscow considered the plan, President Vladimir Putin visited Russia's Kursk region for the first time since Ukrainian troops captured part of it last year, Russian media reported. Kyiv's forces have been on the verge of losing that foothold, which Ukraine hoped to use as leverage in any peace talks with Moscow. With Putin's visit highlighting Russian claims of success in Kursk, Valery Gerasimov, head of the Russian General Staff, told the Kremlin leader that Ukrainian troops were surrounded, according to the reports. But Ukraine's top army commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Facebook that fighting continued on the outskirts of Sudzha town in Kursk and Kyiv's troops will continue operating there 'as long as appropriate and necessary.' The U.S. on Tuesday agreed to resume weapons supplies and intelligence sharing after Kyiv said at talks in Saudi Arabia that it was ready to support a cease-fire proposal. The Kremlin said it was carefully studying the results of that meeting and awaited details from Rubio and White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. Later on Wednesday, the White House said Waltz had spoken with his Russian counterpart. Speaking to reporters when his plane refueled in Ireland, Rubio said on Wednesday: 'Here’s what we’d like the world to look like in a few days: Neither side is shooting at each other, not rockets, not missiles, not bullets, nothing ... and the talking starts.' In Washington, U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that he had received 'positive messages' about the potential for a truce in the three-year-old conflict, without giving details. After Russian forces made gains in Ukraine in 2024, Trump reversed U.S. policy on the war, launching bilateral talks with Moscow and suspending military assistance to Ukraine, demanding that it take steps to end the conflict. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Rubio and Waltz said that they would pass on detailed information to us through various channels about the essence of the conversation that took place in Jeddah. First, we must receive this information,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Rubio said the United States was hoping for a positive response, and that if the answer was 'no' then it would tell Washington a lot about the Kremlin's true intentions. He said that Europe would have to be involved in any security guarantee for Ukraine and that the sanctions Europe has imposed would also be on the table. After a meeting of five European defense ministers, British defense minister John Healey on Wednesday told reporters that work was accelerating on a 'coalition of the willing from Europe and beyond' to support Ukraine. French Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu said about 15 countries had expressed interest. Asked whether Russia could accept the cease-fire unconditionally, Rubio said: 'That's what we want to know - whether they're prepared to do it unconditionally.' Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for Russia's Foreign Ministry, said Russia will make its own decisions and not after agreements made by other parties. Sources told Reuters it was unlikely that Putin would agree to the 30-day cease-fire. In Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed this week's meeting in Saudi Arabia between U.S. and Ukrainian officials as constructive and said a potential 30-day cease-fire with Russia could be used to draft a broader peace deal. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 has left hundreds of thousands of dead and injured, displaced millions of people, reduced towns to rubble and triggered the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West in six decades. During Putin's visit, Gerasimov told him Kyiv's plan in Kursk had failed and Russian forces had regained 1,100 square kilometers (425 square miles) of territory. Putin called for Kyiv's troops in Kursk to be completely defeated. Russian media group Agentstvo, which analyzed Ukrainian open-source maps, earlier said that Ukraine controlled just 150 square kilometers in Kursk. A Ukrainian source said last year it had controlled 1,376 square kilometers of Kursk. Putin has repeatedly said he is ready to talk about an end to the war and Trump says he thinks Putin is serious, though other Western leaders disagree. Reuters reported in November that Putin was ready to negotiate a deal with Trump, but would refuse to make major territorial concessions and would insist Kyiv abandon ambitions to join NATO. Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the international affairs committee of the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's parliament, said on Telegram that Russia's advances in Ukraine must be taken into account in any deal. 'Real agreements are still being written there, at the front. Which they should understand in Washington, too,' he said. In June, Putin set out his terms for peace: Ukraine must officially drop its NATO ambitions and withdraw its troops from the entirety of four Ukrainian regions claimed and mostly controlled by Russia, which holds just under a fifth of Ukraine. Ukraine says the regions have been annexed illegally and that it will never recognize Russian sovereignty over them. The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014 after a Russia-friendly president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution and Russia annexed Crimea, with Russian-backed separatist forces then fighting Ukraine's armed forces in the east. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syrl000yh1e	2025-03-12T14:14:59-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/12/HklZ00LDJnJl/HklZ00LDJnJl_485_195_1356_763_0_small.jpg

‘No one is above the law’: Syria’s coastal massacres spark calls ...	A wave of massacres targeting Alawite civilians in Syria’s coastal region has left over 1,000 dead, prompting an investigation and demands for accountability While some activists claim that certain reports of massacres lack proper documentation, The Media Line visited Al-Sanobar, a village in the Jableh countryside of Latakia, and witnessed evidence of a series of civilian killings targeting the Alawite community. Although no official civilian death toll exists, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed that the number of fatalities from the recent wave of violence in the coastal region has surpassed 1,000. Meanwhile, the Syrian government announced the formation of an investigative committee tasked with uncovering the circumstances of the attacks and prosecuting those responsible. Accessing Al-Sanobar was difficult due to the heavy security measures imposed by government forces. Residents told The Media Line that no young men remain in the village—all were killed by forces allegedly affiliated with the Syrian government. Khaled (a pseudonym) shared the heartbreaking story of his elderly mother, who was shot in the head when troops entered the village. The Media Line documented the deaths of 193 civilians in Al-Sanobar alone. The village bears the scars of what residents describe as an unjust war. Fear dominates daily life, with internet services and electricity cut off and survivors stripped of their mobile phones. It felt like a nightmare. Gunfire erupted suddenly, and the soldiers stormed homes, killing people without asking questions. 'It felt like a nightmare. Gunfire erupted suddenly,' Zina, a resident of Al-Sanobar, said. 'The soldiers stormed homes, killing people without asking questions. Dozens of our neighbors were killed, and their bodies were left in the streets for days with no one able to bury them.' According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, the massacres were carried out by a combination of official government forces, local militias, and foreign Islamist fighters formally linked to the Ministry of Defense but without clear organizational integration. Armed civilians also reportedly supported government troops despite lacking formal military affiliations. The network’s report states that the security operations, launched after coordinated attacks by 'remnants of the Assad regime,' quickly escalated into violent clashes, extending beyond the pursuit of direct perpetrators. Most Al-Sanobar residents now sleep outdoors, unable to return to their homes due to the government’s intensified security crackdown. The Media Line documented a mass grave in the village where victims were hastily buried. I lost dozens of my relatives, all civilians. The government didn’t even deny what happened. Hassan, an Al-Sanobar native who fled before the massacres, called for a transparent investigation and accountability for the perpetrators. 'I lost dozens of my relatives, all civilians. The government didn’t even deny what happened.' Meanwhile, a woman from Al-Sanobar said that since the fall of the Assad regime, fighters from Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) had coexisted peacefully with villagers for four months. She insisted that the perpetrators of the massacres were not HTS members but rather foreign fighters who entered the village, spewing sectarian slurs before killing residents. She declined to reveal her name for security reasons. The United States condemned the killing of civilians by what it called 'radical Islamist terrorists,' urging the transitional administration to hold the perpetrators accountable. 'The United States condemns the radical Islamist terrorists, including foreign jihadis, that murdered people in western Syria in recent days,' US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. Over the past few days, 39 mass killings have claimed the lives of over 1,000 civilians, though military operations in the coastal region have since quieted. Amid media misinformation and the fog of war, Rami Makhlouf, the cousin of ousted President Bashar Assad, blamed Brig. Gen. Ghiath Dalla, former chief of staff in the 4th Armored Division led by Maher al-Assad, for the recent bloodshed. Addressing Dalla, Makhlouf wrote: 'What have you done to our people? Did you trade their blood for money? Didn’t you expect a violent backlash after what you did to the security forces? Why did you drag these helpless civilians into your conflict and exploit their poverty?' Makhlouf also criticized Assad, calling him a 'fleeing president,' adding: 'Wasn’t destroying the country, dividing it, shattering the army, collapsing the economy, and starving the people enough? And after all that, you fled with stolen wealth that could have fed every hungry citizen?' What happened in Syria wasn’t random violence—it was systematic killing against the Alawites 'What happened in Syria wasn’t random violence—it was systematic killing against the Alawites. People were slaughtered for their identity, and the perpetrators must face justice,' Rami Abdulrahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said. According to Abdulrahman, some villages were targeted after calls to 'kill the Alawites' were broadcast from mosques. The Syrian government, however, insists that the violence stemmed from individual actions rather than state policy. In response to the massacres, Syria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, announced the formation of the national independent commission to investigate the coastal region’s events. The commission pledged to hold all perpetrators accountable, emphasizing that the law must be applied equally to everyone, regardless of their position or religious or ethnic background. Yasser al-Farhan, the commission’s spokesperson, said during a press conference in Damascus: 'No one is above the law. Anyone found guilty of human rights violations will face accountability, and our findings will be submitted to the presidency and judiciary for further action.' Farhan stressed that the commission would not release investigation results publicly to protect witnesses; instead, it would share findings exclusively with relevant judicial bodies. He confirmed that the commission aims to conclude its investigations within 30 days, welcoming international cooperation while prioritizing national resources. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The commission, composed of five judges, a security officer, and a human rights lawyer, will investigate the root causes of the events, document civilian abuses, identify responsible parties, and refer those implicated to the courts. Since the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024, the new Syrian authorities have launched a reconciliation initiative for former regime elements willing to surrender their weapons and who do not have blood on their hands. While tens of thousands accepted the offer, remnants of the old regime, particularly in the coastal region, rejected it, retreating to mountain hideouts to stage sporadic attacks. Despite the ongoing trauma, Al-Sanobar’s survivors continue to seek justice, hoping that their testimonies to The Media Line will contribute to accountability and prevent history from repeating itself. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj1111ed1hyg	2025-03-12T13:15:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/09/r1PV8Gjjkl/r1PV8Gjjkl_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Hamas' 'superstar blogger' accused of embezzaling donation for Ga...	Salah al-Ja'frawi accused of pocketing latest campaign, which raised $4 million for Hamas claiming it will aid rebuilding hospital and that it was launched by Palestinian health ministry Gaza-based blogger Salah al-Ja'frawi, who initially rejoiced at the rocket fire from Gaza into Israel on the first day of the war but was later seen weeping in a hospital after Israel’s response, has reportedly amassed a fortune during the conflict. Al-Ja'frawi, known as 'Hamas’ social media star' and a recognizable figure even in Israel, raised funds for Gazans—but it now appears that the money may have ended up in his personal account. Al-Ja'frawi’s latest campaign raised $4 million for Hamas through an appeal for rebuilding Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. He claimed that the Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah had urged him to launch the campaign quickly, prompting him to use the ministry’s logo, along with that of a Kuwaiti charity—apparently without the latter’s knowledge. As part of the campaign, he set a fundraising target of $10 million. However, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah swiftly issued an official statement denying any involvement in fundraising campaigns for Gaza, emphasizing that it was not a partner in any donations or online fundraising efforts conducted by activists. The ministry further warned against unauthorized use of its name or logo for fundraising purposes on any platform, urging the public to verify information only through its official website. The revelations have sparked outrage in Gaza. Palestinian activist Mustafa Asfour condemned al-Ja'frawi, stating: 'The thief Salah al-Ja'frawi collected more than $4 million, and the official Palestinian Health Ministry denied any connection to these donations. I told you before—the Health Ministry in Gaza, controlled by Hamas, backed this thief, not the Palestinian Authority. So, dear donors, your money is gone.' A Gaza resident, Abu Lafi, added: 'Salah al-Ja'frawi and Hamas’ Health Ministry in Gaza, together with the Kuwaiti charity, planned to collect money under the name of the official Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah. Kuwait is a respected country, but this must stop.' A social media activist known as 'Abu Hassan' also weighed in: 'Before the war, he (al-Ja'frawi) was just ‘working in restaurants,’ and after the war, he became a millionaire with one click—using Gaza’s name! Those donating to you, Salah, expected you to help the people of Gaza, not to steal the money. He deceived many donors.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1dnadkhkg	2025-03-12T12:41:25-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/20/B1lsAuewp/B1lsAuewp_0_334_576_325_0_small.jpg
Security forces seize largest West Bank weapons cache in years	IDF and police forces uncover a massive weapons cache in a village near Ramallah, including rifles and explosives; suspects are arrested amid heightened fears of terror attacks during Ramadan Security forces seized one of the largest weapons caches found in the West Bank in recent years, the IDF Spokesperson's Unit reported Wednesday. Troops found the cache hidden in two adjacent apartments in the village of Al-Ram near Ramallah during an operation by the Home Front Command's search-and-rescue forces and detectives from the Israel Police's West Bank District. The raid uncovered M-16 rifles, a Glock pistol, a Ringo firearm, a 7.62mm sniper rifle, a hand grenade, explosives, a remote detonation device, thousands of rounds of ammunition, cash and gold jewelry. 'Binyamin station, acting on precise intelligence, located two apartments used as weapons depots. Our district works around the clock to prevent attacks in Judea and Samaria and inside Israel,' West Bank District Commander Moshe Pinchi said. 'Any weapon that isn't seized can easily end up in the hands of criminals and can all be used for terrorism. We work in full cooperation with the IDF and Shin Bet, which leads to these results.'

A., commander of the IDF battalion that participated in the operation, said his troops have been operating in the area for a long time. 'The difference from previous caches found is the sheer quantity and the presence of explosives.' The fight against illegal weapons in the West Bank has become increasingly significant in recent months amid growing security concerns. Security officials are particularly alarmed by the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners back into the area and ongoing efforts by Hamas and Iran to smuggle weapons and funds to destabilize the region — especially during the sensitive Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The origin of the weapons seized and how they arrived remains under investigation by the Shin Bet and police. The IDF's Central Command is focusing its efforts on seizing illegal arms, particularly by targeting weapons dealers, who often supply both criminals and terrorists. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj3yp8khkg	2025-03-12T12:33:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/12/r1Vxf1H12Jx/r1Vxf1H12Jx_360_11_2384_1342_0_small.jpg
Arab states to continue talks with Trump envoy on Egypt's Gaza pl...	Foreign ministers say consultations and coordination on proposal would continue with Witkoff as 'basis for reconstruction efforts' Arab foreign ministers said on Wednesday they would continue consultations with U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy over Egypt's plan for rebuilding the Gaza Strip, an alternative to Trump's proposed takeover of the Palestinian territory. Consultations and coordination on the plan would continue with the U.S. special envoy, Steve Witkoff, as a 'basis for the reconstruction efforts' in Gaza, according to a joint statement following a meeting of the foreign ministers in Doha. Earlier this month, Arab leaders adopted a $53 billion Egyptian reconstruction plan for Gaza that would avoid displacing Palestinians from the enclave, in contrast to Trump's vision of a 'Middle East Riviera'. Trump's plan reinforced long-standing Palestinian fears of being permanently driven from their homes, and was met with widespread international rejection.

Egypt's reconstruction plan for Gaza provides for an administrative committee of independent, professional Palestinian technocrats entrusted with the governance of Gaza. The plan is detailed in a 112-page document that includes maps of how its land would be redeveloped and dozens of colourful AI-generated images of housing developments, gardens and community centres. Large-scale reconstruction funding would require heavy buy-in from oil-rich Gulf Arab states such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The White House has previously said that the plan, which has recently received backing from France, Germany, Italy and Britain, did not address Gaza's reality. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hysr8vjhjl	2025-03-12T12:01:33-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/SkXdjwz5ke/SkXdjwz5ke_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Israel receives first sign of life from hostage Avinatan Or	Or was last seen when he was abducted in the October 7 massacre with his partner Noa Argamani, who has since been rescued in a military operation For the first time since his abduction on October 7, a sign of life has been received from hostage Avinatan Or. He was last seen in footage captured on the day of the attack alongside his partner, Noa Argamani, who was rescued in Operation Arnon on June 8, 2024. The widely circulated video of their kidnapping, which took place after they arrived at the Nova music festival near Re’im, remains among the most haunting images of that day. The footage shows Argamani being forcibly separated from Or as they were taken into Gaza. Now, after 523 days in captivity, Or’s family confirmed they had finally received proof that he is alive.

Austrian government suspends family reunification for migrants am...	Country's new coalition government cites overwhelmed schools and security risks after a fatal stabbing linked to an asylum seeker as the EU debates stricter deportation policies The new Austrian government said Wednesday that family reunification procedures for migrants will be immediately halted because the country is no longer able to adequately absorb newcomers. The measure was temporary and intended to ensure that those migrants who are already in the country can be better integrated, Chancellor Christian Stocker from the conservative Austrian People’s Party said. 'Austria’s capacities are limited, and that is why we have decided to prevent further overloading,' Stocker said. The new measure means that migrants with so-called protected status — who cannot be deported — were no longer allowed to bring family members still living in their home countries to Austria. The new three-party coalition made up of the People’s Party, the center-left Social Democrats and the liberal Neos has said that curbing migration is one of its top issues and vowed to implement strict new asylum rules. Official figures show that 7,762 people arrived in Austria last year as part of family reunification procedures for migrants. In 2023, the figure was 9,254. Most new arrivals were minors. Migrants who were still in the asylum process or had received a deportation order were not allowed to bring family members from their countries of origin. Most recent asylum seekers came from Syria and Afghanistan, the Austrian chancellery said in a statement. Austria has a population of 9 million. Stocker said the measure was necessary because 'the quality of the school system, integration and ultimately the security of our entire systems need to be protected — so that we do not impair their ability to function.' The government said it had already informed the EU of its new measures. It did not say for how longthe measure would be in effect. 'Since last summer, we have succeeded in significantly reducing family reunification,' Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said. 'Now we are creating the legal basis to ensure this stop is sustainable.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Governments in Europe have been trying to cut the number of migrants. The clamp-down was a severe turnaround from ten years ago, when countries like Germany and Sweden openly welcomed more than 1 million migrants from war-torn countries such as Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. Many communities and towns in other countries, such as Germany, also said they no longer have the capacity to find shelter or homes for migrants. The EU is trying to keep more migrants from entering its 27-country bloc and move faster to deport those whose asylum procedures are rejected. On Tuesday, the EU unveiled a new migration proposal that envisions the opening of so-called 'return hubs' to be set up in third countries to speed up the deportation for asylum seekers whose requests have been rejected. So far, only 20% of people with deportation orders have been removed from EU territory, according to the European Commission. The commission has proposed a 'European System for Returns' that will set a standard for all 27 members of the bloc and allow national authorities from one country to enforce deportation orders issued by another. Such rules were missing from the EU’s migration and asylum pact that was approved last year. Concern over immigration in Austria has been fuelled by fallout from recent security incidents linked to Islamist extremism, including a stabbing rampage last month suspected of being carried out by a Syrian asylum seeker that killed a 14-year-old boy. The government said that in 2023 and 2024, about 18,000 people came to Austria as part of family reunification, including 13,000 school-age children or minors. 'Given the number, it's obvious we should act responsibly and temporarily press the stop button,' Stocker said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyep11r1nyx	2025-03-12T10:10:57-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/BkxZTcZ091g/BkxZTcZ091g_0_57_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Mediators suggest compromise: small, possibly very limited, initial releases to create momentum for further negotiations in the coming days Israeli and American officials expressed cautious optimism Wednesday, citing slight progress in hostage negotiations held in Doha. The talks included White House envoy Steve Witkoff, who recently joined the discussions. While there is no agreement on Witkoff’s proposal to secure the release of all hostages in two stages, mediators have suggested a compromise: small, possibly very limited, initial releases to create momentum for further negotiations in the coming days. Another option under consideration is adopting Witkoff’s proposal to release 10 hostages but doing so in smaller stages. Officials familiar with the talks said their American counterparts were deeply disturbed by reports of torture suffered by the hostages and remain determined to secure additional releases at any cost. However, they also expressed a strong preference to avoid a return to full-scale fighting. Both Israeli and U.S. officials agree that an extended ceasefire without further hostage releases is unsustainable, leading to discussions about setting a firm deadline to reach an agreement soon.

IDF says operation targeted radars, surveillance equipment, command centers, and military facilities containing weapons and vehicles belonging to new regime to prevent future threats The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Wednesday released footage and details of a massive airstrike carried out earlier this week in southern Syria, the most extensive Israeli operation in the country in more than two months. According to the IDF, 22 fighter jets participated in the strikes, which targeted dozens of sites linked to the Syrian military. The operation involved the deployment of more than 60 munitions against radar installations, surveillance equipment used for aerial intelligence gathering, command centers, and military facilities containing weapons and vehicles. 'The presence of these capabilities in southern Syria poses a threat to Israel and IDF operations,' the military said in a statement. 'These targets were attacked to remove future threats.' Syrian reports indicated that at least 41 targets were struck in rural areas near Damascus, with additional strikes taking place elsewhere. The attack, which occurred earlier this week, was the largest Israeli airstrike in Syria since early January. Growing threats in the region IDF disclosed details of the strike amid heightened security concerns over evolving threats in Syria.

According to Israeli assessments, jihadist groups freed senior Hamas and Islamic Jihad operatives from Syrian prisons during the early days of the country’s civil war. These militants, previously jailed by former President Bashar Assad to prevent them from drawing Syria into conflict with Israel, may now be planning attacks. Israeli intelligence was also monitoring the possibility that Turkey could provide military assistance to these groups, further complicating the region’s security landscape. Syria remains in a state of political uncertainty under President Ahmed al-Sharaa as his administration seeks to assert control over the country amid ongoing conflict and foreign involvement. The shifting power dynamics and continued presence of armed factions have heightened concerns in Israel about the potential for new threats emerging from Syrian territory. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjedihkh1e	2025-03-12T09:50:38-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/26/rylV0wWjH1e/rylV0wWjH1e_0_157_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Tehran confirms reception of Trumps' nuclear talks proposal via the UAE; Khamenei dismissed offer, calling it deceptive Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responded Wednesday to remarks made by U.S. President Donald Trump regarding Iran, including a threat Trump issued last week against Tehran. Trump said he had sent a letter to Khamenei offering negotiations on a nuclear deal but warned that there were 'two ways' to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons—'a military option or reaching an agreement.' On Wednesday afternoon, Tehran confirmed it had received the letter via the United Arab Emirates. 'When the U.S. president says he is ready to negotiate with us, it is a deception of public opinion,' Khamenei said. 'There is no point in negotiating when we know the other side does not uphold its commitments. Trump's call for talks is an attempt to appear as if he seeks dialogue and peace while portraying Iran as the one rejecting it.' Khamenei also issued a warning to Trump, saying, 'The U.S. threatens military action, but that would not be a wise move because Iran would respond with a counterattack. They say they will not allow Iran to possess nuclear weapons,' he said, adding, 'If we wanted to obtain nuclear weapons, the U.S. would not be able to stop us. But we do not seek nuclear weapons, and we have explained our reasons for this before.' However, Khamenei’s assertion that Iran does not want nuclear weapons contradicts findings in reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regarding the Islamic Republic’s nuclear activities. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Iran does not seek war,' Khamenei said, 'but if the Americans or their agents make a mistake, Iran's response will be decisive, and the U.S. will be the main loser.'

It's going to be interesting.' He added, 'Soon you’ll be discussing it, and I hope we can reach a peace agreement. I'm not speaking from a position of strength or weakness—I’m just saying I would prefer a peace deal over the alternative. But the alternative would solve the problem.' On Saturday, in his first response to Trump’s remarks, Khamenei said, 'There are bully states that insist on negotiations not to resolve problems but to impose their demands. For them, negotiations are just a way to extract further concessions, and this goes beyond Iran’s nuclear program. Tehran will categorically reject their demands.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyihyn12yl	2025-03-12T08:51:21-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/07/r100SLOdiJe/r100SLOdiJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Trump’s metal tariffs take effect, sparking global trade retaliat...	Canada, biggest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the US, announces 25% retaliatory tariffs on those metals along with computers, sports equipment and other products worth C$29.8 billion in total President Donald Trump's increased tariffs on all U.S. steel and aluminum imports took effect on Wednesday, ratcheting up a global trade war and drawing swift retaliation from Canada and Europe. Trump's action to bulk up protections for American steel and aluminum producers restores effective tariffs of 25% on all imports of the metals and extends the duties to hundreds of downstream products, from nuts and bolts to bulldozer blades and soda cans. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said nothing could stop the tariffs and Trump would impose trade protections on copper as well. Canada, the biggest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States, announced 25% retaliatory tariffs on those metals along with computers, sports equipment and other products worth C$29.8 billion in total. Canada's central bank also cut interest rates to prepare the country's economy for the damage. Trump's hyper-focus on tariffs since taking office in January has rattled investor, consumer and business confidence in ways that economists worry could cause a U.S. recession and slow the global economy. The European Commission said it would impose counter tariffs on up to 26 billion euros ($28 billion) worth of U.S. goods next month. Nevertheless, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters she had tasked Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic to resume talks with U.S officials on the matter. 'It is not in our common interest to burden our economies with such tariffs,' she said. China's foreign ministry said Beijing would safeguard its interests, while Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said the move could have a major impact on U.S.-Japan economic ties. Close U.S. allies Britain and Australia criticized the blanket tariffs, with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the move was 'against the spirit of our two nations' enduring friendship.' However, both countries ruled out immediate tit-for-tat duties. Brazil, the No. 2 provider of steel to the United States, said it would not immediately retaliate. Dental floss to diamonds The 27 countries of the EU are less impacted, for now. Germany's Kiel Institute estimated a hit to EU output of only 0.02%, because 'only a small fraction' of the targeted products are exported to the U.S. The EU's counter-measures target goods like dental floss, diamonds, bathrobes and bourbon - which likewise account for a small portion of the giant EU-U.S. commercial relationship. Still, the liquor industry warned they would be 'devastating' on its sector. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the EU's countermeasures 'disregard the national security imperatives of the United States.' Stock market steady With Wednesday's tariff increase well flagged in advance, global stocks were barely changed on Wednesday, as data showing cooler U.S. inflation. But the back and forth on tariffs has left companies unnerved, and producers of sportswear, luxury cars and chemicals painted a gloomy picture of consumer and industrial health. 'Nearly everyone in the economy is struggling to comprehend wild swings in Washington policies, and their implications for everyday decisions,' said Stephen Dover, Franklin Templeton's chief market strategist. U.S. steel producers welcomed Wednesday's move, noting Trump's 2018 tariffs had been weakened by numerous exemptions. The cost of aluminum and steel in the United States hovered near recent peaks.

A steep U.S. stocks selloff in March has wiped out all of the gains notched by Wall Street following Trump's election. Frayed relations with Canada The escalation of the U.S.-Canada trade war occurred as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prepares to hand over power to his successor Mark Carney, who won the leadership race of the ruling Liberals last weekend. 'I'm ready to sit down with President Trump at the appropriate time, under a position where there's respect for Canadian sovereignty and we're working for a common approach,' Carney said while touring a steel plant in Ontario. Other Canadian officials are due to meet with U.S. officials in Washington on Thursday. Trump repeated on social media he wanted Canada as 'our cherished Fifty First State.' The normally close relationship between the two countries has frayed. The U.S. national anthem has been booed at hockey games and some stores removed U.S. products from their shelves, even before the duties took effect. Travelers are steering clear of the United States, with bookings down 20% from a year ago. Trump on Tuesday threatened to double duties on Canadian steel and aluminum to 50% before backing off after Canada's Ontario province suspended a move to impose a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to some U.S. states. Canada has built a commanding position in the U.S. aluminum market thanks to cheap hydropower resources as U.S. smelters once revived by Trump's tariffs have been idled. Canadian Energy Minister Jonathan Wilkinson told Reuters that Canada could impose non-tariff measures such as restricting oil exports to the U.S. or levying export duties on minerals if U.S. tariffs persist.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syknrvknkl	2025-03-12T08:37:13-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/12/H1EtNXk21g/H1EtNXk21g_0_0_2143_1207_0_small.jpg
Iran's Khamenei rejects idea of nuclear talks with US	Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday rejected the idea of holding negotiations with the United States over a nuclear deal, as a letter arrived from U.S. President Donald Trump calling for such talks. Trump said last week he had sent a letter to Khamenei proposing nuclear talks but also warning that 'there are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal' preventing Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ybdvk3kx	2025-03-12T08:36:35-07:00

A lawyer for the U.S. government on Wednesday said a federal judge in New York does not have jurisdiction to hear a Columbia University student's challenge to his arrest by immigration authorities. The case has become a flashpoint of the Trump administration's pledge to deport pro-Palestinian college activists. Brandon Waterman, a government lawyer, said Mahmoud Khalil, 29, was detained at an immigration facility in New Jersey at the time his lawyers filed a challenge to the legality of his arrest on Sunday morning. Waterman told U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman at a hearing in Manhattan - where Khalil was arrested - that his case should be heard either in New Jersey or in Louisiana, where Khalil is currently in immigration detention.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyddee13jl	2025-03-12T08:21:28-07:00

Lebanon denies border talks could lead to normalization	After Israeli official says Israel hopes to normalize ties with its neighbor to the north, sources in President Joseph Aoun's office tell a Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper that discussions held in Naqoura are part of UN Resolution 1701 Sources in the office of Lebanon's president on Wednesday denied Israeli claims that discussions over a permanent border with Israel could lead to normalization between the two countries. The sources told the Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese network Al-Mayadeen that the establishment of three committees tasked with resolving contentious issues with Israel was part of the continued implementation of UN Resolution 1701. They emphasized that these committees are not separate from Resolution 1701 and that there are no direct negotiations between Lebanon and Israel. 'Any claims that these committees serve as a prelude to normalization are false.' The committees, they said, will address existing issues, including border disputes, contested points from 2006, the five locations seized by Israel after the war, and the issue of prisoners. Earlier on Wednesday, a senior official said that Israel was seeking normalization of relations with Lebanon. 'The Prime Minister’s policies have already changed the Middle East, and we want to continue the momentum and achieve normalization with Lebanon. We and the Americans believe this is possible following the changes in Lebanon. Just as Lebanon has territorial claims regarding the borders, we also have claims and will discuss these matters.' On Tuesday, The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) announced that representatives of the IDF, the United States, France and Lebanon met in the border town of Naqoura. The PMO also announced that 'in coordination with the United States and as a gesture to the new president of Lebanon, Israel agreed to release five Lebanese detainees.' 'During the meeting, it was agreed to establish three joint working groups with the aim of stabilizing the region. These groups will focus on the following topics: the five points in southern Lebanon controlled by Israel, discussions regarding the Blue Line and disputed points, and the issue of Lebanese detainees held by Israel,' the PMO said in a statement. 'Although the talks included an IDF representative, it has been agreed that future discussions will include an Israeli government representative,' the official said. 'This is a dramatic breakthrough. For the new president of Lebanon, this is something difficult to manage politically within Lebanon, which is why we released five Lebanese detainees—so he can present this to his public and say that he brought them back without firing a single shot, as opposed to the resistance that destroyed Lebanon. The goal is to strengthen the president against Hezbollah and Amal, who oppose him, with the hope of achieving normalization with Lebanon. This is the aspiration and why we established the working groups and will continue the talks.' The official said that moving the talks to a diplomatic representative framework is a first step toward Lebanese recognition of Israel. 'The American announcement also confirmed that future discussions would be diplomatic. We are assisting the Lebanese president in managing this issue as smoothly as possible. Lebanon has territorial claims regarding the border, but so does Israel. This does not mean we will automatically withdraw or agree to every Lebanese demand. We will also make demands in accordance with Israel’s national and security interests, with a realistic perspective that Hezbollah is still a part of Lebanon, even though we have significantly weakened and struck them. Every step forward in the talks will be taken with a comprehensive view of the benefits and risks.' David Azoulay, head of the Metula Regional Council, wrote to Prime Minister Netanyahu on Wednesday to voice his concern over the possible outcome of the talks. 'The residents of the north are not willing to be hostages to weak agreements or security compromises.' Azoulay warned of what he called 'fateful consequences' in an agreement. 'Do not agree to partial solutions that would set us back to the same dangers we experienced before the cursed Sabbath of October 7.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Azoulay criticized the decision to release terrorists back to Lebanon as a gesture to the new government without ensuring the security of the residents of the north and without Beirut committing to dismantle all terrorist organizations operating in South Lebanon. 'The State of Israel must not agree to the presence of any terrorist organization in Lebanon, neither north nor south of the Litani River. Any progress in the talks must be based on actions on the ground and not empty promises.' Moshe Davidovich, head of the Mateh Asher Regional Council and chairman of the Forum of Border Communities, said Israel has seen where UN Resolution 1701 has led. 'Israel must remain a strong state that creates a security buffer zone. Any agreement with the Americans and the Lebanese army might contribute to a sense of security, but it cannot replace the security of our residents without the presence of IDF on the borders.' Sources speaking to the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Akhbar newspaper said the release of Lebanese detainees was not a gesture of goodwill on the part of Israel and the talks between the two countries began some time ago. According to the sources, Aoun had asked the Americans to pressure Israel to release the detainees, particularly after Lebanon agreed to extend the 60-day ceasefire by another month. They said that Israel’s lack of response and the absence of American pressure was an embarrassment for Lebanon. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyztn11jhjl	2025-03-12T07:38:00-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/12/HJt9MgJ2yg/HJt9MgJ2yg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Greenland voters push back against Trump’s wish to take control o...	Center-right Demokraatit Party says it is for Greenlanders to decide future of strategically important territory, which holds large reserves of the rare earth minerals A party that favors a gradual path to Greenland’s independence from Denmark won a surprise victory in parliamentary elections, held in the shadow of U.S. President Donald Trump’s stated goal of taking control of the island. The center-right Demokraatit Party has pushed back against Trump’s rhetoric, saying it is for Greenlanders to decide the future of the strategically important territory, which holds large reserves of the rare earth minerals needed to make everything from mobile phones to renewable energy technology. The Arctic island is also home to a U.S. air base and straddles strategic air and sea routes in the North Atlantic. The result should send a clear message to Trump that Greenland is not for sale, Demokraatit leader Jens-Friederik Nielsen told Sky News. 'We don’t want to be Americans. No, we don’t want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders. And we want our own independence in the future. And we want to build our own country by ourselves, not with his hope,' he said. Trump has been outspoken about his desire to control Greenland, telling a joint session of Congress last week that he thought the U.S. was going to get it 'one way or the other.' Moving toward independence from Denmark A break from Denmark wasn’t on the ballot, but it was on everyone’s mind. Greenland was colonized 300 years ago by Denmark, which still exercises control over foreign and defense policy. The island of 56,000 people, most from Indigenous Inuit backgrounds, has been on a path toward independence since at least 2009, and the 31 lawmakers elected will shape the island’s future as it debates whether the time has come to declare independence. Four of the five main parties in the race sought independence, but disagreed on when and how. Second-place finisher Naleraq is the most aggressively pro-independence, while Demokraatit favors a more moderate pace of change. 'What approach to independence will win the day will ultimately depend on if Demokraatit decides to form a coalition government, and if so, with which party,' said Dwayne Menezes, managing director of the Polar Research and Policy Initiative. A surprising victory Demokraatit won nearly 30% of the vote, compared to just 9% in the election four years ago, Greenlandic Broadcasting Corporation KNR TV reported, while Naleraq came in second with almost 25%, up from nearly 12% in 2021. Demokraatit’s upset victory over parties that have governed the territory for years indicated many in Greenland care just as much about social policies such as health care and education as they do about geopolitics. Nielsen, 33, appeared to be surprised by his party’s gains, with photos showing him sporting a huge grin and applauding at the election party. He said that Greenland needs to stand together 'in a time of great interest from outside,' KNR TV reported. Danish broadcaster DR reported that Nielsen said his party would reach out to all other parties to negotiate the future political course for Greenland. Denmark’s reaction Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen congratulated the Demokraatit party and said the future Greenlandic government would likely have to 'deal with massive pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump,' according to DR. He added that 'it’s not the case that you can just take part of the Danish Realm — the future of Greenland is based on what the Greenlandic people and government want,' DR reported. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, meanwhile, called the election 'a joyful day and a celebration of democracy' in a statement Wednesday. She congratulated Demokraatit and said the Danish government would await the results of coalition negotiations. Uniting the country Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede had called the vote in February, saying the country needed to be united during a 'serious time' unlike anything Greenland has ever experienced. On Wednesday, after the results were known, Egede thanked voters in a Facebook post for turning out and said the parties were ready to turn to negotiations to form a government. His party, Inuit Ataqatigiit, or United Inuit, received 21% of the vote. This is a significant decline from the last election, when the party came in strongest with 36% of the vote, according to KNR TV. Inuit Ataqatigiit had been widely expected to win, followed by Siumut — two parties which had dominated Greenland’s politics in recent years. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1gsnmy2yl	2025-03-12T07:32:43-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/12/Bym2ayJ21g/Bym2ayJ21g_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Israel's top rabbinical court overturns suicide victim's will	High Rabbinical Court has ruled that a woman who died by suicide cannot be cremated, despite a request in her will, and that her body must be buried in Israel Israel’s High Rabbinical Court has ruled that a woman who died by suicide cannot be cremated, despite a request in her will, and that her body must be buried in Israel. The court rejected an appeal by the State Attorney’s Office and upheld an earlier decision by the Ariel Rabbinical Court, which had ruled that the woman’s will was invalid due to a lack of legal competence. The woman, 30, drafted her will in August 2023, requesting that if she died in Switzerland, her body be cremated there. She instructed that her remains be stored in Switzerland until her brother could collect them and that all her assets be transferred to her mother. Two weeks later, she was found dead in a Swiss hotel. Her family, who opposed cremation, petitioned the rabbinical court in Ariel, which determined that the will was invalid and that her body should be brought to Israel for burial. The State Attorney’s Office argued on appeal that the rabbinical court had no jurisdiction over the handling of the woman’s body because the matter was not financial. The woman’s mother countered that wills are not limited to financial issues and that the rabbinical court was within its authority to rule on her daughter’s final wishes. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: A panel of three judges—Rabbis Shlomo Shapira, Zion Luz-Illouz, and Zvi Ben Yaakov—ruled that the court was obligated to determine the will’s validity and that it had the authority to do so. 'Having concluded that the deceased was not competent at the time she wrote the will, the court fulfilled its duty by ruling that it has no legal standing,' the judges wrote. The ruling emphasized that the woman’s family—particularly her father, who is in poor health and had pleaded for her burial in Israel—could not be forced to act against their religious beliefs or finance the cremation. The judges noted that, in their view, the woman’s request stemmed from emotional distress, affecting the will’s validity. The court criticized the State Attorney’s Office for contesting the family’s wishes, stating that Jewish tradition prioritizes burial. The ruling also referenced Israel’s ongoing efforts to recover the remains of victims and hostages from the war with Hamas, contrasting those efforts with the legal battle to prevent the woman’s burial in Israel. The court declared the will null and void and ordered that the woman’s body be buried in Israel. The State Attorney’s Office was also ordered to pay the family 30,000 shekels ($8,300) in legal fees. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sje4fgk2kl	2025-03-12T06:35:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/03/23/B1HfjruGq/B1HfjruGq_1_105_1000_563_0_small.jpg

Can Palestinians go from destroyers to builders?	Dan Feferman developed the concept of 'builders and destroyers' to help explain when Israel and moderate players in the region can collaborate—and when they cannot One of the reasons Israelis were so surprised by the October 7 attack is that Israel is a society of builders, while Palestinian society operates with a destroyer mindset, according to Dan Feferman. Speaking on the ILTV News podcast, Feferman, founder of Sharaka—a group working to shape a new Middle East through dialogue, understanding, cooperation, and friendship—shared his insights from a recent visit to Abu Dhabi with a group of Israelis. The group remarked on how the city resembled Gaza in some ways, but with one major difference: its diversity. Click here to view this week's ILTV News Podcast. 'You see people dressed as they want,' Feferman said. 'Some people are dressed incredibly traditional, and some people are very Western. You hear the call to prayer in malls, but you also see Western outlets selling lingerie and Western bookstores. You realize there is this other, alternative path that not only the Arab and Muslim world can take—but is taking.' Watch these previous episodes of the ILTV News Podcast: Why Are Rabbis Backing MAGA?

He argued that Palestinians have repeatedly prioritized harming Israelis over building up their own society. He pointed to Saudi Arabia as an example of a country undergoing a 'fascinating' transformation of both Islam and society under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS). 'It’s a long process. It’s not an overnight one, but you see how to de-radicalize the population,' Feferman said. 'I think the Arab world and the Western world need to understand this paradigm and help transform Gazan society—Palestinian society, whatever you want to call it—from a destroyer society to a builder.'

Women in leadership: Eynav Mass on navigating career growth and c...	LinkedIn Israel’s Country Manager and Director of Engineering, Eynav Mass discusses her professional journey; speaking to Ynetnews, she discusses her thoughts on the role of women in leadership, and the importance of fostering inclusive workplace cultures In celebration of International Women’s Day, we sat down with Eynav Mass, LinkedIn’s Country Manager and Director of Engineering in Israel, to discuss her path to leadership, the challenges and opportunities women face in the workplace, and the steps she has taken to promote inclusivity and professional growth within her team. Step by step: A journey to leadership Reflecting on her career trajectory, Mass describes herself as a 'stepper'—someone who approaches challenges one step at a time. Rather than mapping out a rigid long-term plan, she focused on making tangible progress in the present while keeping her aspirations in mind. 'I remember when I started my Bachelor of Science studies, I had my eldest daughter in my second year. I didn’t know how to navigate motherhood and a career at the same time. I was still a student, without industry experience,' Mass recalls. 'So, I took it step by step. My first goal was to find a student job as an engineer and take it from there.' Watch the interview That approach proved successful, enabling her to grow steadily in her career. She emphasizes the importance of being pragmatic and focusing on the immediate next step rather than feeling overwhelmed by long-term uncertainties. Challenges and perceptions in the Workplace When discussing the challenges women face in leadership, Mass acknowledges that while gender disparities exist, she personally never felt that her gender was a barrier to career advancement. 'I didn’t feel that I was denied a salary raise, job opportunity, or promotion because I am a woman. Maybe I did face gender-related obstacles, but I never interpreted them as such,' she explains. 'For me, it helped to focus on my skills and my work rather than on external limitations.' While recognizing that systemic gender inequalities persist, she believes that her perspective—viewing herself as equal and capable—has contributed to her success. 'Maybe I’ve encountered challenges related to gender, but I didn’t let them define my career path,' she says. The competitive edge women bring to the workplace Mass highlights that with the rise of artificial intelligence and technological transformation, the demand for soft skills in the workplace has increased significantly. 'Soft skills, especially communication, were among the top skills in demand on LinkedIn in 2024. Research shows that women often excel in these areas, which positions them well in leadership roles.' She points out that women’s strengths in adaptability, creativity, and leading through change offer a competitive advantage, particularly in evolving work environments. Building inclusive and supportive work cultures A strong advocate for workplace diversity, Mass believes inclusivity should be defined beyond gender. 'In Israel and globally, workplaces must address various forms of diversity, including accessibility, cultural backgrounds, and more.' At LinkedIn, she strives to create an environment where individuals are valued for their skills and contributions rather than personal characteristics. 'We need to shift discussions towards what team members bring to the table and the value they create,' she asserts. One specific initiative Mass has championed is workplace flexibility—not just for women but for all employees. 'Many workplaces offer flexibility to support women balancing careers and motherhood, but I believe true equality means extending that flexibility to men as well,' she explains. 'If we want to create a more equal society, we need to enable all parents to take an active role in family life.' Advice for aspiring women leaders For young women aspiring to leadership, Mass emphasizes the importance of self-belief and perseverance. She recalls her own early doubts about balancing career and motherhood and how she overcame them by looking at role models who had done it before. 'At one point, I thought my career was over before it even began. I didn’t know anyone who had successfully balanced a career and family life. But then I reminded myself—millions of women have done it before, and so can I.' Her message to women is clear: 'There are many women out there succeeding in their careers while pursuing their personal dreams. You can do it too. Believe in yourself and go for it.' International Women’s Day serves as a reminder of the progress made and the work still to be done in achieving true workplace equality.

Boehler, Trump’s special envoy for hostage affairs, faces criticism for direct talks with Hamas and controversial remarks about a potential cease-fire; His efforts include negotiating hostage releases, advocating American commando raids and addressing tensions between US and Israeli interests Adam Boehler, a 51-year-old Jewish member of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council and a staunch supporter of Israel since the October 7 massacre, has been at the center of controversy in his role as President Donald Trump’s special envoy for hostage affairs. Appointed to the position three months ago, Boehler has made several contentious statements regarding the hostage situation, ranging from advocating for U.S. commando raids in Gaza to holding direct negotiations with senior Hamas officials and hinting at the possibility of a long-term cease-fire ('hudna') between Hamas and Israel. Born in New York to Jewish parents, Boehler was college roommates with Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, at the University of Pennsylvania. His career began in a tech-focused venture capital firm before he co-founded a private company specializing in health care services. Boehler later founded a lab management company for the U.S. healthcare system, as well as the largest home health care company in the U.S., which was sold in 2021 for $3.5 billion. That same year, he established Rubicon Founders, a health care investment firm. Boehler’s connection to the U.S. government started in 2018 when he was appointed to lead the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. In 2019, he became the CEO of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), a federal agency created during Trump’s first term, which was dissolved in 2021. He also led the federal task force for streamlining COVID-19 testing and was appointed by Trump to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council. Boehler, who is active in the Jewish community in Nashville, Tennessee, where he lives with his wife Shira and their four children, has been a vocal supporter of Israel since the October 7 massacre. He previously served as a mediator for Trump in the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and Bahrain, the UAE, Morocco and Sudan. In recent days, Boehler stirred controversy during interviews in which he confirmed holding direct negotiations with senior Hamas officials. Some Israeli cabinet ministers called his statements 'unnecessary,' while former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman sharply criticized Boehler’s actions, tweeting, 'Adam, I know you mean well, but listen to your boss.' In interviews, Boehler revealed Hamas’ proposals during the direct talks and hinted that the U.S. does not rule out a long-term cease-fire with the terror organization. Speaking to Kan, the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation, Boehler stated, 'Hamas offered a deal that includes the release of all hostages and prisoners, as well as a five-to-10-year cease-fire during which Hamas would disarm. The U.S., along with other countries, would ensure there are no more tunnels, no military activities, and that Hamas would no longer be involved in politics.' In an interview with Fox News, Boehler added, 'We’ve had discussions about what the end might look like, and I can say Hamas is aiming for a long-term ceasefire. We discussed a cease-fire that includes Hamas disarming, staying out of politics, and ensuring they cannot harm Israel.' Addressing Iran, he said, 'It’s not complicated for us to work with Israel to strike Iran’s nuclear capabilities, and that’s probably what we need to do.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Speaking on CNN's 'State of the Union,' Boehler did not rule out further meetings with Hamas and suggested that 'something could happen regarding Gaza and the hostages within weeks,' without elaborating. He also speculated, 'I think all the hostages could be released, not just the Americans.' Addressing Israeli frustration with U.S. negotiations with Hamas, Boehler said: 'I understand why Israelis are upset, but we are the U.S. — we’re not Israel’s agents, and we have our own interests. Maybe I’ll meet them and say, ‘They don’t have horns growing out of their heads; they’re actually guys like us, nice guys.’' He added that the meetings with Hamas representatives 'were approved by Trump and were very helpful in advancing the release of the hostages.' Following widespread criticism, and possibly after receiving reprimands, Boehler issued a clarification on Twitter: 'I want to be clear because some misunderstood — Hamas is a terrorist organization that has murdered thousands of innocent people. By definition, they are bad people. As President Trump said, no Hamas member will be safe if they don’t immediately release all the hostages.' According to reports from the Qatari news outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, Boehler is also involved in efforts to resolve the case of hostage Elizabeth Tsurkov. Two senior Iraqi officials told the outlet that the Trump administration formally requested Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia’ Al-Sudani to resolve the crisis or face 'political and economic consequences.' One of the officials confirmed that Boehler delivered the message, issuing direct warnings to Iraq in recent days regarding Tsurkov. The official stated that Boehler 'threatened a package of American punitive measures against Iraq if Tsurkov is not released, emphasizing that the Iraqi government is responsible for her swift return.' In December, when Boehler was appointed to his current role, Trump described him as someone who 'has negotiated with some of the toughest people in the world, including the Taliban.' Boehler expressed gratitude for the opportunity, saying, 'There is nothing more important than bringing our citizens home. Under Trump’s leadership, there will finally be action and consequences. We will bring them home.' During the war, amid Lebanon’s rocket attacks and the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, Boehler expressed hope that these developments would result in 'Abraham Accords on steroids.' He added, 'It’s hard to fight without arms or when your testicles have exploded. They also contributed to the Lebanese government by eliminating Hezbollah.' Later, he criticized then-President Joe Biden, who called for a cease-fire in Gaza, stating, 'We need to remember who our allies are. They are not Hamas terrorists; they are Israel and the modern Arab states.' In an opinion piece published in The Hill, Boehler called for a more aggressive approach to rescuing American hostages, including a military raid by U.S. commandos in Gaza. He wrote, 'U.S. soldiers are more than skilled enough to carry out a rescue. American special forces have a strong track record of successfully penetrating enemy territory to free hostages. Those opposing U.S. military presence in Gaza should remember that a single, targeted operation is not the same as prolonged military involvement.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/b14fmtpiye	2025-03-12T05:34:39-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/SkhN5UwiJl/SkhN5UwiJl_713_454_2201_1239_0_small.jpg
Israel to begin employing Syrian Druze workers in Golan Heights p...	Israel plans a one-day pilot to employ 40 Syrian Druze workers in the Golan Heights to address labor shortages in agriculture; While some farmers are optimistic, others remain skeptical about the long-term feasibility and security implications of the project Druze residents from Syria will begin working in the towns of the Golan Heights on Sunday, Defense Minister Israel Katz has announced. However, for now, arrival of the workers will be a one-time occurrence as part of a pilot project announced on Tuesday, which is yet to become permanent. In the north, there are those who are skeptical about the plan’s success. 'I don’t believe it will happen, maybe in three or four years,' estimated Alex Kudish, the orchard manager of Kibbutz Ein Zivan, adjacent to the Syrian border. In recent weeks, under the instructions of Defense Minister Katz, the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), led by Major General Ghassan Alian, has been working on a framework to employ Druze workers from neighboring villages across the Syrian border. According to the plan, the framework will provide much-needed employment for the Druze across the border, while simultaneously addressing the severe shortage of labor in agriculture and construction in northern Israel. However, Katz’s announcement does not yet signify a breakthrough for Golan farmers. For now, it is merely a pilot program of sorts, part of a working plan, under which approximately 40 Druze workers from Syria will arrive on the 16th of the month and work for one day in Majdal Shams. According to a joint investigation by Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth, further planning and security measures are required before Syrian Druze workers can be permanently employed in Israel. It remains unclear how many work permits will be granted or through which routes the workers will enter Israel. At the same time, reports from Syrian sources and publications in Arab media indicate that the new Syrian government has reached agreements with the Druze community in the As-Suwayda province, promising them integration into state institutions and security services. This development could complicate the situation. According to IDF sources, the intention is to allow Syrian Druze residents, many of whom have relatives in Druze villages in Israel, to enter the country, similar to how Lebanese workers were once allowed to work in Israel before the withdrawal from southern Lebanon, or how work permits are granted to Jordanian residents employed in the Eilat and Dead Sea regions. Last weekend, Golan Regional Council head Uri Kalner met with Katz to discuss employing workers from Syria. 'The army has been instructed to advance this with us, but it’s still a developing process,' Kalner said. 'At peak season, up to 3,000 workers are needed for agriculture here, and there’s always a need for more hands. Syrian workers from neighboring areas could certainly help. Of course, we’ll ensure that security conditions allow it and that only Druze workers who ultimately accept Israel’s existence and support it will come here.' Despite the potential economic and logistical benefits, skepticism remains among Golan farmers. 'I don’t believe it will happen, maybe in three or four years,' said Alex Kudish, manager of the orchards at Kibbutz Ein Zivan, near the Syrian border. 'I believe by then, the borders might even be open. But until then, we’re still in the middle of what feels like World War III in the Middle East, and everything here is constantly changing. Just yesterday, IDF struck several targets in Syria.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Kudish has no doubt that the hardworking hands of Syrian neighbors across the border could significantly aid the Golan orchards. 'Hopefully, it’ll happen, because it would also be more economical to employ workers from Syria. They wouldn’t demand the high wages we have to pay local or Thai workers here. We’re short on workers, and we can’t keep up with the wages demanded by local labor. Syria is no longer a threat to us, and if this contributes to good neighborly relations, even better.' The head of the local council in Ein Kinya, Wael Mugrabi, voiced both support and caution regarding the plan. While praising the intention to bring Druze workers from Syria, he warned that such a move could endanger the Druze beyond the border. 'Unfortunately, we know how Israel is viewed in Syria and in the Arab world in general,' Mugrabi said. 'It could be perceived as if they are traitors or collaborators with Israel.' Mugrabi suggested any initiative involving Syrian Druze should be handled discreetly to ensure their safety. 'We know Druze have no interest in fighting Israel, and vice versa. I’m confident that if they come here, we’ll provide them with financial security, and on the other side, they’ll be strong and know how to protect themselves.' In addition, for the first time since 1974, about 100 Druze religious leaders from Syria, living in villages along the Israeli-Syrian border, are expected to visit Israel. The purpose of the visit is religious, focusing on sites such as the tombs of Nabi Shu’ayb (Jethro) and other Druze saints. The unique visit is set to be finalized tomorrow at all levels, and if all goes well, the religious leaders will arrive by the weekend. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz have repeatedly stated their commitment to ensuring the safety of Druze in southern Syria, amid brutal fighting led by Ahmad al-Sharaa against minorities in the country. Since al-Sharaa's rise to power in Syria, Druze communities in three regions of the country have expressed increasing concern over his intentions to establish an Islamist state that does not respect minorities or other religions. Syria also remembers the 'As-Suwayda attacks,' a series of suicide bombings and shootings carried out by terrorists from al-Sharaa’s organization during the Syrian civil war. The attacks occurred in 2018 in the city of As-Suwayda and its surroundings, killing 258 people, most of them Druze from the region, including 142 civilians, among them 38 women and children. During his visit to IDF positions at the demilitarized zone on the peak of Mount Hermon on Tuesday, Defense Minister Israel Katz said, 'Every morning, when al-Sharaa opens his eyes in his presidential palace in Damascus, he will see the IDF watching him from the heights of Mount Hermon and remember that we are here, in every security sector.', has been working on a framework to employ Druze workers from neighboring villages across the Syrian border. According to the plan, the framework will provide much-needed employment for the Druze across the border, while simultaneously addressing the severe shortage of labor in agriculture and construction in northern Israel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjfg111j3jg	2025-03-12T05:12:16-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/11/yk14292446/yk14292446_205_204_985_555_0_small.jpg
He threw a live grenade to save his friends—now he's a hostage in...	Bipin Joshi’s final words have haunted his family, who remain in a remote village in western Nepal This is the story of Bipin Joshi. Bipin Joshi took a leap of faith and left his home country of Nepal for the first time on September 12, 2023. He and 16 other students were selected to study agriculture and work in the fields of Kibbutz Alumim, near the Gaza border. The program was designed to provide them with valuable knowledge for their future careers. 'He went to Israel just for his studies—to learn from Israel and apply that knowledge to agriculture in Nepal,' said his best friend, Bhumika Bista. His parents were hesitant about their only son traveling 3,500 miles away for the program, Bista explained. However, Joshi ultimately boarded the plane and embarked on his 11-month educational journey in Israel. 'He knows how to lead,' said his friend Himanchal Kattel, who traveled from Nepal with Joshi and was also part of the program. 'He’s also very spiritual. He meditated every day.' Now 24 years old, Joshi is described as composed and a natural-born leader. However, coming from another part of the world, he found it difficult to understand the complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the role of Hamas, the terrorist organization that governs Gaza. Kattel said he and the other students were aware that living near the Gaza border came with risks and that there were tensions between Palestinians and Israelis, but they did not fully grasp the extent of the threat. 'We were told that if there were sirens, we would need to go to a bomb shelter—that was it,' Kattel recalled. 'We never imagined something this bad could happen to us.' On the morning of October 7, 2023, sirens blared across the communities closest to the Gaza Strip. Residents of Kibbutz Alumim, located just five kilometers from the border, were instructed to take shelter. Joshi and the other Nepalese students followed protocol and hid in a bomb shelter. After about an hour and a half, the situation escalated. The students began hearing shouting outside. 'At the time, we didn’t know the difference between Hebrew and Arabic—it all sounded the same to us,' said Kattel. At that moment, they still did not fully understand what was happening, but then they heard gunfire. 'Two of our friends stepped outside to see who was shooting. They were both shot immediately. Then, two grenades were thrown inside,' he said. Hamas terrorists hurled two live grenades into the bomb shelter where Joshi, the other students, and several Thai workers were taking cover. One grenade exploded, injuring five students. In a split-second act of bravery, Joshi grabbed the second grenade and threw it out of the shelter before it could detonate. 'If both grenades had exploded, I don’t think I would be alive today,' said Kattel. The terrorists then forced the students into another room with other people from the kibbutz and opened fire. Soon after, they grabbed Joshi and took him away. He was never seen again. Kattel only learned that Joshi had been kidnapped by Hamas days later, while recovering in the hospital from three gunshot wounds sustained in the attack. 'We saw a video from the hospital. Physically, he didn’t seem too hurt,' he said. Footage released by the IDF, later confirmed by Joshi’s friends and family, appears to show him being dragged into Gaza’s Shifa Hospital on the morning of October 7. Though the video does not clearly show his face, his loved ones identified him, taking it as proof that he had been kidnapped alive. 'That morning, he spoke to his cousin and said he was at risk. He told him to take care of his family if anything happened to him,' Bista said. 'It’s too painful for us to believe… but that was his last message to his cousin.' Joshi’s final words have haunted his family, who remain in a remote village in western Nepal. Due to language barriers and a lack of understanding about the conflict, they only learned he had been kidnapped two days later. 'We received a list of students—those who had been killed that day. We were also told that he was missing… That was the worst news we could have received,' Bista said. That morning, Hamas terrorists murdered ten Nepalese students, injuring several others. Kattel, who still receives medical treatment for his gunshot wounds, decided to stay in Israel and pursue a master’s degree. But as life continues outside of Hamas’s tunnels, Joshi’s friends and family are left wondering why he has not been released. 'A lot of thoughts run through your mind. Sometimes you’re hopeful, sometimes you’re hopeless. There’s a constant conflict between your emotions,' said Kattel. 'It’s been 16 or 17 months. I think you can imagine how his family feels.' Bista describes Joshi as an innocent person caught in the middle of a conflict he had nothing to do with—a foreign student who came to Israel to build a better future for his home country. Today, Joshi has been held captive by Hamas for 522 days. His condition remains unknown, as there have been no signs of life from him since the release of other hostages. However, Israel believes he is among the 24 men still presumed alive in Gaza. 'He must return to all of us as soon as possible. He must not lose hope… His family is waiting for him. All of Nepal is waiting for him,' said Bista. 'We know he will come back to us.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkwzvb12jx	2025-03-12T04:59:18-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/12/rkl4CNZk2kl/rkl4CNZk2kl_0_78_600_338_0_small.jpg
Somalia hotel siege death toll rises to 10, officer says	The death toll from an al Shabaab attack on a hotel in central Somalia where clan leaders were meeting on Tuesday has risen to 10 and most of the victims were civilians, a police officer in the town said on Wednesday. On Tuesday, attackers from the al Qaida-linked group struck the hotel in Beledweyne with a car bomb before its gunmen entered the hotel and engaged in a day-long siege with government forces trying to flush them out. Clan elders from the Hiran region had gathered in the hotel for a meeting to discuss ways of countering al Shabaab before the attack, which the Islamist militant group claimed responsibility for. Al Shabaab often conducts bomb and gun attacks in the fragile Horn of Africa nation as part of a campaign launched nearly two decades ago to topple the government and establish its own rule based on its strict interpretation of Islamic law.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjrjrz1n1x	2025-03-12T04:59:00-07:00	
Greece to spend more than 25 bln euros in arms procurements by 20...	Greece will spend more than 25 billion euros in arms procurements by 2036, including new submarines, drones, satellites and fighter jets, under a 12-year plan to be submitted to parliament in the coming weeks, three officials with knowledge of the plan told Reuters. The move is part of Greece's bid to modernize its armed forces as it emerges from the 2009-18 debt crisis that led to years of austerity, and as it tries to keep pace with its historic rival Turkey. The two countries are at odds over sea boundaries, energy resources and airspace in the eastern Mediterranean. The new plan will build on recent reforms. Greece, a member of the European Union and NATO, already spends about 3% of its gross domestic product on defense. That is nearly double the average in the EU, which is under pressure to bolster defenses as its 75-year-old alliance with the United States comes under strain. The plan will include the purchase of four new submarines, new air, sea and underwater drones, and a communication satellite, said two sources who participated in the preparation of the plan. Part of the money will be used to develop an anti-aircraft and anti-drone dome, called 'Achilles Shield', and to pay for 20 F-35 fighter jets that have been ordered from the United States. Under the plan, Greece will also upgrade older F-16 fighter jets to 'Viper' level and upgrade four German-made MEKO 200 frigates already serving in the navy. A third source said that the plan will include up to six new big patrol boats or corvettes, to be built in Greek shipyards. The new plan follows already-announced plans to buy new a long-range rocket artillery system with a range of up to 300 km. Most of these will protect Greece's northeastern border with Turkey and its islands in the Aegean	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1h00nzk3kg	2025-03-12T04:57:37-07:00

Rats wouldn’t survive in such conditions': Omer Wenkert's mother...	Omer Wenkert shared harrowing accounts of abuse and survival during his 505 days as a hostage; His mother, Niva, called his return a miracle and vowed to continue fighting for the hostages still left behind; 'Captivity brings out superhuman strength in a person that helps them survive the worst of all' Niva Wenkert, the mother of Omer Wenkert, spoke on Wednesday morning about the harrowing testimony her son gave regarding his time in captivity in Gaza. 'Throughout the entire ordeal, I told myself that I trust my son,' Niva said in an interview with Ynet studio. The mother emphasized, in light of the 59 hostages still left behind, 'We are continuing the fight, now also in the name of Omer, who is joining us.' Omer shared, for the first time Tuesday night, details about his long period of captivity, describing 505 days in Gaza during which he endured constant physical abuse, including starvation and beatings by the captors. However, he stressed that the greatest fear 'wasn’t death, but the thought of becoming like Ron Arad, or being stuck in this situation for another 15 or 20 years.' In an extensive interview with Keshet Channel 12 News, Omer recounted the abduction from the Nova Festival near Reim, which he had attended spontaneously with his girlfriend Kim Damti, who was murdered by the attackers. He testified that, even after realizing that terrorists had infiltrated the area, he still believed that 'any moment, IDF would come and neutralize them.' An hour after the massacre began, terrorists reached the shelter where Omer was hiding with other festivalgoers near the Reim junction and began throwing grenades inside. 'Suddenly, a woman screamed into her phone, ‘They’re killing us, they’re burning us.’ That might have been the hardest thing I heard while in the shelter.' A particularly difficult moment came on his birthday when a terrorist woke him and attacked him brutally. 'I got hit on the head with a metal rod — that was my birthday present. The terrorist woke me up in complete frenzy and with insane aggression. He humiliated me, hit me, but even as he did that, I looked him in the eyes. After he left, I completely broke down and decided to bless myself for my birthday, right at that moment, to wish that I wouldn’t get beaten on my next birthday. Just something small — not even to go home.' On the day of his release, Omer shared, 'Omer Shem Tov or Eliyahu Cohen began singing ‘Shir Lama’alot’ [a Hebrew psalm], and we found ourselves singing together, from the heart. The moment I saw the Red Cross, it was the biggest relief imaginable.' Omer explained that the psychological terror show staged by Hamas during his release, where he was paraded in public, 'didn’t humiliate me.' He described, 'For me, that was the victory. I finished the struggle. I fought, and I won. I was smiling from ear to ear. The first thing I told my mother was that I defeated captivity. I meant it — I overcame it completely.'

Omer returned to his home in Gedera, where he was warmly welcomed by the residents of the town. 'The heart swells with pride, love, and gratitude,' said his mother, Niva, on Wednesday morning. 'The fact that Omer is home is nothing short of a miracle. I obviously didn’t trust those holding him, and yet I was very surprised. You’ve heard his testimony — captivity is hell underground. Rats wouldn’t survive in such conditions. Physical, verbal and mental violence, with constant, immediate danger to life, 24/7, for such a long time. Captivity brings out superhuman strength in a person that helps them survive the worst of all.' Niva added that, since Omer’s return, she finds herself 'staring at him more. I just find myself looking at him constantly and touching him more. He’s my son, and we know that there will be moments when he’ll have setbacks, and we’re prepared for that. For now, he’s going out of the house a bit, meeting friends. There’s also rehabilitation at Rabin Medical Center.' 'He’s rediscovering the world,' she concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/syxbwc0syg	2025-03-12T03:13:32-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/04/Bkze9O4jyx/Bkze9O4jyx_0_0_1280_885_0_small.jpg
Russia says it needs to hear from US before commenting on propose...	The Kremlin said on Wednesday that it needed to be briefed by the United States on the outcome of U.S.-Ukrainian talks in Saudi Arabia before commenting on whether a proposed cease-fire in Ukraine was acceptable to Russia. Ukraine said on Tuesday it was ready to support a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Russia, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Americans would now take the offer to Russia. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow expected to be briefed in the coming days by Rubio and White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz on Tuesday's talks with Ukraine in Jeddah. Peskov also said he did not rule out the possibility of a phone call between presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, which he said could be organized very quickly if needed. Asked on his daily briefing call with reporters whether the 30-day ceasefire proposal was advantageous to Russia or not, and whether Moscow would link a possible ceasefire to other demands, such as the lifting of Western sanctions on Moscow, Peskov said: 'You are getting a little ahead of yourself. Yesterday, when talking to the press, both Rubio and Waltz said that they would pass on detailed information to us through various channels about the essence of the conversation that took place in Jeddah. First, we must receive this information.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj1ipars1x	2025-03-12T02:13:30-07:00

Kidnapped Elizabeth Tsurkov 'may have been transferred to Iran', ...	Iraqi prime minister does not know where Israeli-Russian researcher kidnapped in Baghdad in 2023 is being held; Official says 'any decision regarding her will come only from the government in Tehran'; Emma, ​​Elizabeth's sister, tells Ynet: 'For the first time since the kidnapping - there is room for optimism' Iran is believed to be involved in the detention of Israeli-Russian researcher Elizabeth Tsurkov, who was kidnapped in Baghdad in 2023 by the Shiite militia Kataib Hezbollah, an Iraqi official told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth. According to the official, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani 'does not know where Tsurkov is being held,' adding that 'it’s a stroke of luck she’s still alive. Usually, captives don’t survive the interrogations.' Two senior officials in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump have joined efforts to secure Tsurkov’s release: Adam Boehler and Rep. Mike Waltz. Boehler, Trump’s special envoy for hostage affairs, told Saudi-owned Al Arabiya that the U.S. is pressuring Iraq’s prime minister, who 'continues to claim he doesn’t know where Tsurkov is being held,' but has acknowledged that the Iran-backed Iraqi Hezbollah militia abducted her. Reuters reported Monday that Boehler traveled to Iraq about three weeks ago to meet with senior officials and attempt to break the deadlock in locating Tsurkov. In an interview with Ynet from the United States, Emma Tsurkov, Elizabeth’s sister, said: 'I’ve spoken directly with Adam Boehler several times, and I’ve also met his team. The updates are encouraging. It’s amazing that in just a few weeks of determined effort, they’ve made more progress than in the previous two years. I really hope this pressure from the Americans works soon so I can hug my sister again.' 'They’re very careful not to give me false hope, but in all my conversations with Adam Boehler, he’s been incredibly kind and patient. I don’t know how he finds the strength to speak with hostage families with such empathy,' Emma Tsurkov said. 'He told me the same thing Steve Witkoff said when I met him in Washington a week and a half ago — that they are working on this, that my sister is important to them, and that it’s unacceptable to them for a Princeton student to be held captive in a country allied with the U.S.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Addressing claims from Iraqi officials that Tsurkov may have been transferred to Iran, Emma Tsurkov said: 'I’ve heard that before. If I had a dollar for every time an Iraqi official told me that, I could buy Iraq. It’s a convenient excuse they keep repeating, but it’s not true. She is not in Iran. The Iraqi government knows exactly who is holding her because the terror group detaining her is part of the Iraqi system.' 'We’re afraid to be optimistic too soon,' she added. 'Until I’m holding her in my arms, it’s not over. But for the first time since the kidnapping, there’s reason for hope. She’s alive. She’s in Iraq.' No longer branded a 'Zionist spy' American diplomatic efforts have also impacted how Tsurkov is described on Iraqi social media. She is no longer labeled a 'Zionist spy' or 'CIA agent,' as she was forced to declare in a previously recorded video released by her captors. Now, social media posts refer to her as 'the Israeli researcher who entered Iraq on a Russian passport, ignoring the ban on Israeli citizens.' Tsurkov was abducted in March 2023 in Baghdad’s Karrada district. Iraqi social media reports claim Iran is pushing for a prisoner exchange deal in return for her release. The proposed deal reportedly includes freeing Emad Ahwaz, a naval officer linked to Hezbollah and captured by Israel; Iranian terrorist Reza Nouri, imprisoned in the U.S.; and an Iranian 'infiltrator' held in Cyprus. While some speculate that Tsurkov was transferred to Iran for interrogation and negotiations, an Iraqi official told Ynet that Prime Minister al-Sudani 'has no precise information on her whereabouts but does know who kidnapped her.' This is the second time the U.S. has pressured al-Sudani to act, the official said. 'The first time, less than a year ago, he was confident she would be released and even made promises to the Americans. It didn’t work. This time, for more than a week, the Americans have been threatening Iraq with direct economic sanctions.' The official, who lives with his family in Baghdad’s fortified Green Zone, explained that Israel cannot intervene directly to secure Tsurkov’s release. He confirmed that Kataib Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia responsible for her abduction, still holds her in an undisclosed location. He said Tsurkov was kidnapped after leaving a café with an Iraqi citizen — possibly someone who betrayed her and handed her over to the militia. 'There’s full documentation and witness testimony from people on the street who reported the kidnapping to Baghdad’s security forces,' he said. 'The prime minister sent police and intelligence officials to speak with the militia leaders. They promised to ‘arrange her release,’ but nothing happened. When they followed up, the response was: ‘We don’t know where she is.’' The Iraqi official also confirmed that, for months, U.S. officials believed Tsurkov had been taken to Iran for questioning. 'It’s possible she was moved there secretly, or Iranian intelligence agents were brought in to interrogate her,' he said. 'It’s a miracle she’s still alive. Usually, hostages are executed during interrogations. Her foreign identity is working in her favor.' He added that Prime Minister al-Sudani would prefer to hand her over to the Americans but genuinely doesn’t know where she’s being held. According to the official, the U.S. has demanded Iraq 'resolve the case of the Israeli hostage Elizabeth Tsurkov,' who entered Iraq on her Russian passport. Israel reportedly appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to intervene, but he has not acted. 'That’s why the Americans are emphasizing her Israeli citizenship and threatening Iraq with sanctions if it doesn’t act quickly,' the Iraqi official said. Nearly a year after her abduction, a video surfaced of Tsurkov pleading in Hebrew for her release. In the recording, she 'confessed' to working for Israel’s Mossad and the CIA and 'demanded' Israel stop its 'heinous attacks.' Before her kidnapping, Tsurkov was an outspoken critic of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and publicly stated, 'If I’m kidnapped, don’t pressure anyone to secure my release.' Despite that, U.S. mediators are applying heavy pressure on Iraq, warning of punitive measures if Tsurkov isn’t freed soon and handed over to the Americans. According to the Qatari daily Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, Adam Boehler has threatened Iraq with economic and diplomatic consequences, making it clear the U.S. holds Iraq responsible for ensuring her release. While the Iraqi government says it is taking steps to locate her, there has been no cooperation from her captors. 'We believe Iran is involved and giving the orders,' the Iraqi official said. Last week, Iraq’s National Security Adviser Qasim al-Araji announced renewed efforts to locate Tsurkov, but so far, they have not succeeded. 'No group in Iraq has claimed responsibility for holding the Israeli-Russian researcher,' he said. 'The Tsurkov case is directly linked to Iran,' the senior Iraqi official concluded. 'Only they will decide her fate.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjbeb3ro1l	2025-03-11T23:36:01-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/11/yk14292454/yk14292454_0_29_691_389_0_small.jpg

Taking over influence the US is backing away from' : Europe begi...	With Washington treating alliances as negotiable rather than essential, Europe is forced to take on a greater role in security and international diplomacy; 'There’s a power vacuum, and it’s going to be filled' Over the past decade, the geopolitical landscape between the United States and the European Union has undergone significant changes. The once-stable transatlantic alliance is experiencing fractures, driven by shifting U.S. policies and Europe’s push for greater autonomy. This evolving relationship is evident in responses to international crises, such as the war in Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East, as well as Europe’s renewed focus on military capabilities. A transatlantic divide: The US steps back, Europe moves forward Historically, Washington has led, with Brussels following its direction. However, recent years have disrupted this dynamic, particularly during the Trump administration. Mattia Diletti, a researcher in the Department of Communication and Social Research at La Sapienza University in Rome, argues that the shift is not due to Europe pulling away but rather to the US stepping back. 'It is not Europe that dissociates itself from the United States, but it is the United States that dissociates itself from Europe, from NATO,' according to Diletti. 'This administration has decided to intervene in a transformative way on the liberal order that the United States has shaped after World War II.' This change reflects a broader departure from the post-World War II multilateral system, moving toward a more transactional approach based on spheres of influence. As Diletti explains: 'What is changing is the system of international relations with the abandonment of a multilateral system based on international institutions led by the United States, toward another model based on spheres of influence.' The Ukraine war: Europe fills the US void The shift in U.S. engagement is most evident in Ukraine. With Washington showing hesitancy in sustaining its support, Europe has been compelled to take a more active role in Kyiv’s defense. Steven Terner, an American geopolitical analyst, describes this transition. 'Europe is going to pick up the slack that the United States is dropping,' he said 'So Europe will continue to support Ukraine, and it’ll support Ukraine probably even more than the US was, because it’s afraid of being left without the United States entirely.' Yet, the consequences of reduced US involvement extend beyond military aid. Terner warns that Washington’s reluctance to fully back Ukraine is weakening its global standing: 'The risk is the United States is simply losing geopolitical influence by not supporting Ukraine. It’s losing credibility with Europe, and it’s losing credibility with all of its allies internationally. And Europe is taking over the influence that the United States is backing out of.' Rearming Europe: A new military power emerges In response to these geopolitical shifts, European nations have significantly increased their defense spending. The European Union has announced an ambitious $800 billion plan for security and military development. Diletti sees this as a crucial step, though one that remains largely theoretical. 'We are evoking a future of an autonomous Europe politically and militarily, but from a practical and material point of view, we are far from it,' he said. Despite growing defense budgets, he remains skeptical about Europe's ability to act decisively: 'The transformation of political Europe, for me, is like a soap bubble. Europe must change its approach to decision-making. Otherwise, all this movement risks becoming a soap bubble.' The Middle East: Europe and the US on diverging paths Beyond Ukraine, differing approaches to Middle Eastern conflicts further illustrate the widening gap between the U.S. and the EU. The Trump administration’s stance on Israel and Palestine, particularly regarding the Gaza crisis, clashed with European leaders, who supported an Egyptian-led peace initiative. Terner points to Europe’s limited ability to enforce its policies: 'Even though Europe supports the Arab and Egyptian plan, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to be implemented, because they can’t implement it without Israel.' Similarly, Diletti questions whether Europe has ever wielded real influence in the region: 'Clearly, it is an attempt to gain autonomy and to reason in terms of reasonable terms. But the question remains: Have Europeans ever really had much influence in this region?' A new world order? The growing divide between the U.S. and Europe is forcing both to reconsider their roles in global affairs. While Europe pushes for strategic independence, the U.S. appears increasingly focused on a transactional foreign policy, treating alliances as negotiable rather than essential. 'Everywhere that the United States pulls out of will be filled by somebody else. There’s a power vacuum, and it’s going to be filled,' Terner observes: For now, Europe seems ready to step into that gap. Whether it can truly establish itself as a dominant geopolitical force or remain hindered by internal divisions remains uncertain.	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rkt11dqcoke	2025-03-11T21:40:27-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/28/HJ23vdkiyl/HJ23vdkiyl_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Is Jesus angry? Kanye West's church burned down	The property the antisemitic rapper purchased next to his church in Los Angeles burned to the ground, destroying his hopes of expanding his house of worship; Neighbors in the area obtained 12,000 signatures for a petition calling for the property not to be sold to him citing his offensive and antisemitic statements It seems Kanye West has managed to anger not only people on Earth but perhaps higher powers as well—Jesus, for instance. How else to explain the fate of the abandoned church building the embattled rapper purchased for $1.5 million, only for it to burn to the ground? On Monday, reports surfaced that West’s hopes of expanding his church in Los Angeles went up in flames after the adjacent building he bought was destroyed by fire. West acquired the one-story property in the San Fernando Valley in 2023. The building was previously owned by Cornerstone Christian Church, located next door. Despite West’s declarations that he planned to expand his church, he never followed through. The property remained neglected and abandoned. Neighbors had long complained about the building’s deteriorating condition even before the fire. Reports also noted that prior to the sale, more than 12,000 people had signed a petition urging the church not to sell the property to West, citing his offensive and antisemitic statements. Nevertheless, the sale went through, particularly after West formed a close relationship with Cornerstone’s former pastor, Ronald Nagin.

Trump's hostage envoy visited Iraq to push to free kidnapped Eliz...	U.S. President Donald Trump's Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs Adam Boehler traveled to Iraq last month to push for the release of Israeli-Russian researcher Elizabeth Tsurkov, who was kidnapped in Iraq nearly two years ago, three sources familiar with the matter said. Since taking office, Boehler has stepped up efforts to secure the release of Tsurkov, a Princeton University student who went missing in Iraq during a research trip in March 2023, publicly urging the Iraqi government to help her get home. Tsurkov is being held in Iraq by the Shiite militia Kataib Hezbollah, a group backed by Iran, according to Israeli officials. Boehler is trying to negotiate a deal under which Tsurkov will be released in exchange for six members of Iran-aligned Lebanese militia Hezbollah, one of the sources, adding that there was a whole of government effort to bring her back. 'The United States cannot tolerate hostage-taking of U.S. nationals or those of our partners such as Israel. We have and will continue to underscore with the Iraqi government the urgency of securing Elizabeth Tsurkovâ€™s release,' a State Department spokesperson at Boehler's office said. In a February 5 post on social media platform X, Boehler advocated for Tsurkov's release. 'Elizabeth Tsurkov is a Princeton student held hostage in Iraq! The @IraqiPMO consistently made false promises to the prior administration about releasing her. BUT NOW @realDonaldTrump IS ON TO YOU,' Boehler said, tagging the official handle of Sudani's office. He said if Tsurkov does not come home, then the Iraqi prime minister's office is 'either incapable and should be FiRED or worse COMPLICIT. Bring Elizabeth home now!' Under the previous administration of former President Joe Biden, Tsurkov's family struggled to get Washington to throw its weight behind the efforts to secure her release. U.S. officials then said there was little they could do because she is not an American citizen. 'March 21 will be the two year anniversary of my sister's kidnapping. Hopefully she will not endure March 21 in their custody,' Emma Tsurkov said. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke on the phone on February 25 with Sudani. While a State Department statement on the conversation did not mention a discussion on Tsurkov, one of the sources said Rubio pushed the Iraqi prime minister on her case.

USAID employees ordered to shred records, court filing says	An official at the U.S. Agency for International Development has ordered employees to shred a large volume of records, according to a court filing on Tuesday by government employee unions asking a judge to block the move.

'Shred as many documents first, and reserve the burn bags for when the shredder becomes unavailable or needs a break,' Carr wrote. The unions said the directive 'suggests a rapid destruction of agency records on a large scale' that both violates federal record-keeping law and could destroy evidence in their case. The lawsuit was brought by the American Federation of Government Employees and American Foreign Service Association, which represent government employees, as well as by anti-poverty organization Oxfam America.

Houthis announce renewal of naval blockade on Israel: 'Until aid ...	Almost 24 hours after ultimatum from Iran's envoys in Yemen expired, Houthi terrorist leaders announced they will again attack any ship linked to Israel: 'We salute the Palestinian people and we will stand by them' ; The Houthis have not threatened to fire at Israeli territory, but the Air Force is prepared for any scenario Following the expiration of the Houthi ultimatum on Tuesday evening, the spokesman for the Iran-backed militia in Yemen, Yahya Saree, announced that the maritime blockade on Israel would continue 'for another month, until the crossings into Gaza are opened for humanitarian aid.' He added, 'The Yemeni forces salute the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank, and affirm that they stand alongside the Palestinian resistance.' Earlier Tuesday, Houthi Defense Minister Mohammed al-Atifi said the group’s forces were 'ready and fully prepared to carry out the leadership’s instructions to support Gaza and assist Palestinian fighters.' The Houthi cabinet issued a similar statement, warning it was 'prepared for any developments or consequences resulting from Yemen’s support for Gaza and Palestine.' The Houthi ultimatum specifically threatened to resume attacks on 'Israeli ships,' rather than firing missiles or drones at Israeli territory. Still, the Israeli Air Force remains on high alert, although officials said this level of readiness is standard and not the result of a new threat. Last week, Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi said naval operations against Israeli ships would resume if humanitarian aid shipments to Gaza did not restart within four days. That deadline passed at midnight Monday. On Tuesday, he reaffirmed the group’s warning, saying Houthi forces were ready to act and that military operations would begin immediately if aid shipments did not resume.

Israel has been preparing for the possibility that the Houthis will follow through on their threats, which could include both a renewed naval blockade and missile attacks. Officials said Israel is working closely with U.S. Central Command and is expecting a stronger American response than during President Joe Biden’s term. Former President Donald Trump, in his first month in office, designated the Houthis as a terrorist organization and imposed sanctions on senior Houthi officials. Israel has struck Houthi targets in Yemen five times during the current war. Despite heavy damage to some of their key assets, the Houthis are threatening a 'second round' of attacks. Israel’s most recent strike in Yemen was Jan. 10, just days before the transition of power in Washington. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1jsoxasjl	2025-03-11T13:30:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/02/04/HkUa8gJ656/HkUa8gJ656_0_111_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Saudi Arabia appointed to lead UN women’s rights commission despi...	Like putting Dracula in charge of blood bank': Saudi Arabia, despite poor track record on women's rights, now leads the UN Commission on the Status of Women, sparking criticism over its influence on global gender equality policies Despite its questionable record on women’s rights, Saudi Arabia took over as chair of the UN Commission on the Status of Women on Monday and will lead the annual global summit on gender equality on March 21. 'This is surreal. Appointing Saudi Arabia to head the world’s leading body for women’s rights is like putting Dracula in charge of a blood bank,' said Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch, a Geneva-based independent human rights organization. Neuer added that Saudi Arabia now holds a key position to influence the commission’s agenda and decisions. 'Despite cosmetic reforms, Saudi Arabia continues to subject women to legal discrimination, effectively keeping them enslaved under a male guardianship system that was codified into law three years ago—ironically, on International Women’s Day.' 'The Personal Status Law, which Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described as a ‘quantum leap forward,’ entrenches discrimination against women in family life and preserves many of the most oppressive aspects of the guardianship system,' Neuer said.

This is a dark day for women’s rights and for human rights as a whole.' This marks the first time since the commission’s establishment in 1946 that Saudi Arabia has been appointed as its chair. The 45-member commission unanimously elected Saudi Arabia to the position on March 27, 2024, without objections, as it was the sole candidate. Leadership roles within the commission typically rotate among the UN’s five regional groups, and the Asia-Pacific group, which includes Saudi Arabia, had unanimously endorsed its candidacy. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkzhi11aokx	2025-03-11T12:02:12-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/08/03/9401930/9401930_0_0_1300_732_0_small.jpg
‘He wasn’t arrested for speaking up’: Columbia U still rocked by ...	The arrest of a Columbia graduate heavily involved in anti-Israel protests on campus for alleged ties to Hamas, has increased tensions on a campus already grappling with destructive protests, free speech debates, and accusations of antisemitism As Monday dawned in New York City’s Morningside Heights neighborhood — home to Columbia University and Barnard College as well as three of the nation’s leading religious seminaries — residents of this urban college community struggled to absorb the dramatic events of the past two weeks. Students heading to class on this sunny yet chilly morning and residents strolling along Claremont Avenue and Morningside Drive alike seemed overtaken by a somber mood. 'I cannot believe what has taken place here,' said a Columbia professor walking his dog near the campus who requested anonymity. He said that the quality of life for everyone in the neighborhood has been severely impacted. 'I am very concerned about what comes next,' he said. While the professor was reacting to the local protests, marches, rallies, encampments and building takeovers of the past two academic years, he was referring most immediately to news of federal agents storming a Columbia-owned residence on Saturday night, just blocks from his own apartment, arresting Mahmoud Khalil. Khalil, a 29-year-old Palestinian graduate of Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs, was a mainstay of anti-Israel protests at Columbia during the previous academic year. He was the self-described spokesperson for Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), an anti-Israel group on campus. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the impetus for the dramatic arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents was Khalil’s violation of 'President Trump’s executive orders prohibiting antisemitism' and 'activities aligned to Hamas,' the US-designated terror group. Khalil, whose pregnant wife is an American citizen, was taken to the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Jena, Louisiana, though his whereabouts were not known for 36 hours after his arrest. Agents threatened to revoke his student visa and his green card. Trump has vowed to deport Khalil, but a federal judge blocked the deportation order until a conference on Wednesday. Some critics call the arrest indicative of a new McCarthyism, while others say the move was simply meant to force American colleges to comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and guarantee that the rights of Jewish students are safeguarded. EJ Kimball, director of interfaith engagement at the Combat Antisemitism Movement, described Trump’s call to deport Khalil as 'common sense.' 'Those opposed need to reassess their own values,' Kimball said. 'This is not about weaponizing antisemitism or silencing free speech; this is about enforcing the rule of law and about universities failing to uphold the civil rights law.' Shoshana Aufzien, a first-year student in a double degree program at Barnard and the Jewish Theological Seminary, said that a mood of anxiety has come over Columbia’s campus since the arrest—a mood she said is likely unwarranted. 'I empathize with students who are worried about ICE being on campus but also believe that you should not be concerned if you are not fomenting pro-terror, antisemitic sentiments,' Aufzien said. 'There was a reason [Khalil] was arrested,' she added, describing him as being part of a 'really insidious group of CUAD people who have material ties to US-designated terror groups.' Shai Davidai, an Israeli Columbia business professor and outspoken advocate for Jewish students, also defended the arrest. 'Like Mahmoud Khalil, I too am on a green card. Unlike Khalil, I don’t support US-designated terrorist organizations, take over university buildings, and call for the genocide of anyone,' he posted on X. 'He wasn’t arrested for speaking up. He was arrested for breaking the conditions of his stay here.' By Monday afternoon, Davidai’s X account was flooded with accusations by supporters of Khalil, alleging that Davidai had reported him to ICE, a charge that Davidai denies. The Anti-Defamation League similarly lauded the Trump administration’s 'broad, bold set of efforts to counter campus antisemitism' in a post on X, though it added that 'any deportation action or revocation of a green card or visa must be undertaken in alignment with required due process protections.' While some groups were pleased to see stronger responses to antisemitism, others were concerned about the arrest’s implications. A spokesperson for the New York Civil Liberties Union characterized Khalil's arrest and detainment as an 'extreme attack on his First Amendment rights.' Bend the Arc, a progressive Jewish political organization, characterized the White House’s move as 'authoritarian,' accusing the new administration of cynically claiming to combat antisemitism while furthering its own political agenda. 'We’ve been afraid this day would come since campus protests began. Free speech and education are pillars of our democracy, and a healthy democracy is what keeps Jews safest,' the group wrote on social media. Reflecting on the incident, Jewish student activist Eliana Goldin expressed a more nuanced reaction. 'I’m a Columbia student, and the lack of critical thinking is astounding. Just because people disagree with ICE detaining Khalil doesn’t mean there’s not rampant antisemitism on campus. But apparently holding two seemingly contradictory ideas together is too difficult for the Ivies,' Goldin wrote on X. Two weeks before Khalil’s arrest, on Wednesday, February 26, protestors wrapped in keffiyehs and face masks descended on Barnard’s Milbank Hall, disrupting classes and barring passage to anyone who needed to access the building’s services. For six hours, the group congregated outside the office of Barnard Dean Leslie Grinage. The catalyst for that protest was the expulsion of students who stormed a History of Modern Israel class at Columbia the previous month. Disrupting the lesson, the masked students passed out anti-Israel fliers, one of which featured a picture of a jackboot stomping on a Star of David. During the February protest inspired by the expulsions, a Barnard public safety officer was injured badly enough to require hospitalization. Recordings of the protest, which was organized by Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine, showed administrators unsuccessfully attempting to reason with the impassioned protesters. One video that went viral on social media showed Barnard professor Jackie Orr heckling public safety officers and confronting a student about 'whether you support a genocide.' The next week, on Wednesday, March 5, protesters were back in force at Barnard’s Milstein Library. By that point, the protests had become so predictable that one Jewish first-year student at Barnard wearily texted this reporter: 'They took over a building. Classic.' This time, protesters displayed an effigy of Barnard President Laura Rosenbury, distributed pro-Hamas literature, and hung posters praising slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. After a bomb threat was phoned in, the university called the NYPD to clear the building—a move that many universities have seen as a last resort in the decades since the Vietnam protests of the 1960s. Videos filmed by students showed the police wrestling recalcitrant protesters onto the lawn and binding their hands with zip ties before taking them away in police vans. Two days later, as the weekend loomed, came the stunning news that the Trump administration was halting $400 million in funding earmarked for Columbia as punishment for the school’s failing to protect its Israeli and Jewish students. The administration said that Columbia would be the first of 10 universities to face financial sanctions. That day, Columbia’s interim president, Katrina Armstrong, released a statement in which she said Columbia was 'working with the federal government to address their legitimate concerns' regarding antisemitism on campus. She noted that the cancellation of funding would have immediate effects on 'research and other critical functions of the university, impacting students, faculty, staff, research, and patient care.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: At a community-wide Shabbat dinner later that day, scores of Jewish students and faculty at Barnard and Columbia congregated for a festive meal in Morningside Heights. While the mood was festive, students shared difficult stories of their experiences on campus. They affirmed to one another how challenging it has been to be publicly Jewish at Columbia, as Zionism—and sometimes Judaism itself—has become heavily stigmatized. Speaking publicly, a well-known Columbia professor affirmed Armstrong’s sincerity in her efforts to fight antisemitism while validating the students’ experiences and concerns. She urged them to stay and 'fight the good fight' rather than hand the campuses over to antisemites and Israel-haters. The professor also cautioned the students against being manipulated by politicians who have their own agendas and goals that are not in sync with those of Jewish students. 'Do not allow yourselves to be used,' she warned. The resolve to stay and fight was also expressed by Barnard first-year student Aufzien. 'I’m really worried about the value of my degree depreciating,' she confessed, adding that she has been advised several times by concerned family members and friends to switch to Stern College, the women’s school of Yeshiva University. 'I would not be having the commensurate experience at Stern. Leaving is not a panacea,' Aufzien said. 'We have to fix this problem, as it doesn’t seem that the administration can or will.'

Ukraine says ready for 30-day cease-fire, as US resumes military ...	The United States agreed on Tuesday to resume military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine immediately after talks in Saudi Arabia in which Kyiv voiced readiness to accept a U.S. proposal for a 30-day cease-fire in its conflict with Russia, the countries said in a joint statement. The Trump administration imposed the measures a week ago to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to enter talks to end the war with invading Russian forces. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he would now take the offer to the Russians, and that the ball is now in Moscow's court. 'The President wanted this war to end yesterday... So our hope is that the Russians will answer 'yes' as quickly as possible, so we can get to the second phase of this, which is real negotiations,' Rubio told reporters, referring to U.S. President Donald Trump, after the statement was issued. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was in Saudi Arabia but did not participate in the talks, said the cease-fire was a 'positive proposal,' that covers the frontline in the conflict, not just fighting by air and sea. The two sides also said Washington and Kyiv agreed to conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine's critical mineral resources, a deal that has been in the works for weeks and was thrown into limbo by an acrimonious White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky last week. Zelensky said the two countries would work to finalize the minerals agreement. National security adviser Mike Waltz said that 'the Ukrainian delegation today made something very clear, that they share President Trump's vision for peace.' Waltz said negotiators 'got into substantive details on how this war is going to permanently end,' including long-term security guarantees. The announcements emerged as senior officials from Ukraine and the United States opened talks in Saudi Arabia focused on ending Moscow's three-year war against Kyiv. The discussions started only hours after Russia shot down over 300 Ukrainian drones. It was Ukraine's biggest attack since the Kremlin ordered the full-scale invasion of its neighbor. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is expected to travel later this week to Moscow, where he could meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to a person familiar with the matter but not authorized to comment publicly. The person cautioned that scheduling could change. Earlier in the day, journalists were briefly allowed in a room where a senior Ukrainian delegation met with Rubio, who smiled at the cameras and when asked about his expectations for the meeting, gave a thumbs-up and replied, 'Good.' Across the table, Ukrainian officials, including the country's top diplomat and defense chief, showed no facial expressions as the meeting got underway at a luxury hotel. However, Ukrainian presidential aide Andriy Yermak told reporters that the most important thing was 'how to achieve a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.' He said security guarantees were important to prevent Russia from invading again in the future. It was the first meeting between the two sides since the Oval Office blowup between Trump and Zelensky last month. Saudi Arabia's foreign minister was also on hand as American, Saudi and Ukrainian flags could be seen in the background. Officials did not answer any of the journalists' shouted questions. The delegations met for about three hours in the morning before taking a break, and officials said the talks continued in the afternoon. There was also no immediate comment from Ukrainian or U.S. officials on the massive attack in which 343 drones targeted 10 Russian regions, leaving three people dead and 18 wounded, including three children, officials said. The Kremlin is sticking to its conditions for peace The Kremlin has not publicly offered any concessions. Russia has said it's ready to cease hostilities on condition that Ukraine drops its bid to join NATO and recognizes regions that Moscow occupies as Russian. Russia has captured nearly a fifth of Ukraine's territory. Russian forces have held the battlefield momentum for more than a year, though at a high cost in infantry and armor, and are pushing at selected points along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, especially in the eastern Donetsk region, against Ukraine's understrength and weary army. Ukraine has invested heavily in developing its arms industry, especially high-tech drones that have reached deep into Russia. This is the full text of the joint U.S.-Ukrainian statement that was published after bilateral talks in Saudi Arabia's Jeddah on Tuesday: Today in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia - under the gracious hospitality of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - the United States and Ukraine took important steps toward restoring durable peace for Ukraine. Representatives of both nations praised the bravery of the Ukrainian people in defense of their nation and agreed that now is the time to begin a process toward lasting peace. The Ukrainian delegation reiterated the Ukrainian people's strong gratitude to President Trump, the U.S. Congress, and the people of the United States for making possible meaningful progress toward peace. Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day cease-fire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation. The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace. The United States will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine. The delegations also discussed the importance of humanitarian relief efforts as part of the peace process, particularly during the above-mentioned cease-fire, including the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children. Both delegations agreed to name their negotiating teams and immediately begin negotiations toward an enduring peace that provides for Ukraine's long-term security. The United States committed to discussing these specific proposals with representatives from Russia. The Ukrainian delegation reiterated that European partners shall be involved in the peace process. Lastly, both countries' presidents agreed to conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine's critical mineral resources to expand Ukraine's economy and guarantee Ukraine's long-term prosperity and security. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1v3ybrs1g	2025-03-11T11:26:47-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/24/BkXom0yAA/BkXom0yAA_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
IMF approves $1.2 billion for Egypt after reform program's fourth...	The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved disbursement of $1.2 billion to Egypt after completing the fourth review of the country's $8 billion economic reform program. The IMF's executive board also approved Egypt's request for an arrangement under the resilience and sustainability facility (RSF), with access to about $1.3 billion, the lender's statement added. Cairo has requested financing under the RSF since 2022, with hopes it could unlock up to an additional $1 billion. Egypt on Monday reported headline inflation almost halved in February, helped by financial reforms taken as part of the IMF financial support agreement. Annual urban consumer price inflation decreased to 12.8% in February from 24.0% in January and core inflation also plunged more than expected to 10% on a year-on-year basis in February, from 22.6% in January. Owing to the IMF deal and record UAE investments, analysts and bankers expect foreign investors to largely roll over their holdings of Egyptian treasury bonds. Egypt, which has been grappling with high inflation and shortages of foreign currency, agreed to the expanded IMF programme in March 2024. A sharp decline in Suez Canal revenue caused by regional tensions over the past year compounded its economic woes.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hytb911cj1e	2025-03-11T11:08:22-07:00

Netanyahu denies receiving money from Qatar, files lawsuit against Ya’alon for spreading false claims; Ya’alon responds, accusing Netanyahu of ties to Hamas and Qatar, amid ongoing criminal investigation Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday denied any involvement in the 'Qatar-Gate' scandal, responding to accusations from former defense minister Moshe (Bogie) Ya’alon. Netanyahu filed a lawsuit against Ya’alon for spreading what he called the 'despicable lie' that he received money from Qatar. In a video posted on social media, Netanyahu said: 'I’ll tell you, I didn’t receive anything from Qatar, but from Bogie, I will — and this is just the beginning.' He added that nothing would stop him from making decisions in Israel’s best interest, particularly for its security. Netanyahu criticized the 'fake scandals' that have emerged recently, calling them 'hot air balloons' that disappear as quickly as they are created. The prime minister further rejected attempts to intimidate him, saying that 'campaigns of blackmail and threats' would not deter him. 'We all know where this comes from, and it won’t stop me,' Netanyahu said, emphasizing that he would continue prioritizing national security. Ya’alon responded to Netanyahu's video, questioning the prime minister's ties to Hamas and accusing him of involvement in financial dealings with Qatar. 'I hear that the Hamas financier intends to sue me. Let him! Perhaps this will be an opportunity to hear his explanation for the suitcases of cash from Qatar to Hamas,' Ya’alon said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ya’alon also raised concerns about Qatar’s alleged funding of Netanyahu’s close associates and mentioned a recent gag order imposed on details of the investigation by Israel’s Shin Bet security agency. 'The attempt to dismiss the head of Shin Bet and the attorney general is a result of this pressure,' he added. Ya’alon criticized Netanyahu for focusing on maintaining power rather than resolving the ongoing conflict with Hamas. Netanyahu's lawsuit follows an interview Ya’alon gave on Israel Radio, where he alleged that three members of Netanyahu's office were under suspicion of receiving funds from Qatar. Ya’alon also claimed that Netanyahu received $15 million from Qatar in 2012 and $50 million in 2018. 'There are intelligence documents from the UAE proving this,' Ya’alon said. This legal battle comes amid a high-profile investigation into the relationship between Netanyahu’s office and Qatar, a key financial backer of Hamas and mediator in hostage negotiations. The Israeli Attorney General's office confirmed earlier this month that it had opened a criminal investigation into the so-called 'Qatar-Gate' affair, which has led to a rare court-issued gag order on the case details. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjrtakroyg	2025-03-11T10:46:59-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/10/H1D811wXnj1g/H1D811wXnj1g_0_6_946_532_0_small.jpg

Entire families killed during Syria's military crackdown, UN says	Entire families including women and children were killed in Syria's coastal region as part of a series of sectarian killings by rival groups during an insurgency by Bashar Assad loyalists, the U.N human rights office said on Tuesday. Pressure has been growing on Syria's Islamist-led government to investigate after reports by a war monitor of the killing of hundreds of civilians in villages where the majority of the population were members of Assad's minority Alawite sect. 'In a number of extremely disturbing instances, entire families - including women, children and individuals hors de combat - were killed, with predominantly Alawite cities and villages targeted in particular,' U.N. human rights office spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan said, using a French term for those incapable of fighting. So far, the U.N. human rights office has documented the killing of 111 civilians and expects the real toll to be significantly higher, Al-Kheetan told a Geneva press briefing. Of those, 90 were men; 18 were women; and three were children, he added. 'Many of the cases documented were of summary executions. They appear to have been carried out on a sectarian basis...,' Al-Kheetan told reporters. In some cases, men were shot dead in front of their families, he said, citing testimonies from survivors.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1gfiecikg	2025-03-11T09:43:22-07:00	
The Palestinian-American businessman who serves as secret advisor...	Bashar al-Masri, a Palestinian-American entrepreneur and a Trump confidant, has become a key figure in efforts to address the challenges of rebuilding Gaza; Known for his neutrality and vision, al-Masri combines Western business savvy with deep Palestinian roots, advocating for peace, reconstruction and Palestinian unity Bashar al-Masri, 64, a Palestinian-American businessman, never imagined he might one day be seen as the person who could save the Gaza Strip and stop the war, as some in the U.S. are anticipating. Masri serves as a secret advisor to the Trump administration and is emerging as the 'shadow figure' of Adam Boehler, the U.S. envoy for hostage affairs, whose name garnered attention recently after it was revealed that he was involved in direct talks with senior Hamas officials. A long-time friendship based on business and mutual interests exists between Boehler and Masri, who is currently in Brazil. Although no joint photos of the two have been published, as part of Masri's involvement—which was first reported by journalist Ben Caspit — he has reportedly allowed Boehler to use his private jet for months to facilitate negotiations with Hamas. The al-Masri family: Prominent and neutral players Bashar Masri belongs to a prominent family from Nablus. Two other family members are well-known globally: billionaires Munib and Sabih al-Masri. Munib is his uncle, while Sabih is a distant relative. The al-Masri family is considered neutral, unaffiliated with any Palestinian factions. Over the years, the family has refrained from political involvement to avoid jeopardizing their extensive business ventures. Palestinian leaders, including Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas, have tried to recruit them into politics but failed. Offers for ministerial positions in the Palestinian Authority have been declined by both Munib and Sabih, as well as Bashar himself. Masri is married to an American and lives a Western lifestyle, which could appeal to Donald Trump. Despite his luxurious life — he drives grandiose cars and is often accompanied by aides and bodyguards — he remains deeply involved in Palestinian affairs, advocating for the international community, particularly the U.S., to understand the realities in the West Bank and Gaza. He also uses his Instagram account, with tens of thousands of followers, to share his message. Born and raised in Nablus, Masri left for the U.S. at a young age, where he studied chemical engineering at Virginia Tech. He worked for a consulting firm in Washington, where he met his wife, Jane. Around 2005, he returned to Palestine with his wife and two daughters and established his holding company, Massar. In a past interview, he described himself as 'half-Palestinian, half-American.' He said: 'I don't think or act like the average Palestinian, but my heart and soul are Palestinian.' From protests to business success Despite his Palestinian-American identity, Masri has had several encounters with Israeli prisons due to his participation in protests against Israel. He was often held under administrative detention, which has contributed to his stature in Palestinian society. Masri is seen as a role model for many young Palestinians. However, as he has explained in the past, 'People thought I inherited everything — but I didn't. I came with very little money from my work abroad, and I started investing and developing myself.' His flagship project is undoubtedly the city of Rawabi (which translates to 'Hills'), located near Ramallah. It is the only planned Palestinian city and has been dubbed the 'Palestinian Modi'in' (a reference to a modern Israeli city). The city was built at an estimated cost of over $1 billion, with Qatar also contributing to its funding. Rawabi includes a large commercial center, a high-tech hub where even Apple engineers work, and an amphitheater. Interestingly, most of the apartment buyers in Rawabi have been Arab-Israelis rather than Palestinians. Ties to Gaza and Israeli plans Masri's name has been linked to past Israeli plans to distribute humanitarian aid in Gaza through Palestinian officials who could also govern the Strip. In March last year, The Wall Street Journal reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected such plans because some of the involved individuals, such as Majed Faraj and Mohammed Dahlan, were associated with Fatah. According to the report, the aid was supposed to enter Gaza via sea and land, be inspected by Israel, and then distributed by Palestinians. After the war, those managing the aid were expected to assume governing roles in Gaza. However, Netanyahu, according to the report, did not rule out Masri's involvement, as he is seen as unaffiliated with any political faction among Palestinians. Masri frequently comments on current events. Regarding the Arab League summit held last week in Cairo, where Egypt presented an alternative plan to Donald Trump's for rebuilding Gaza, Masri said: 'It could become a historic summit if it results in a Palestinian initiative to set a date for general elections, strengthen Palestinian legitimacy and prepare for the next critical phase.' During the hostilities in Gaza, Masri called for a 'cessation of aggression' in the Strip. In one instance, he stated, 'Deal or no deal — the most important thing is to stop the aggression and alleviate the suffering of our people in Gaza.' Following the declaration of the current cease-fire, he said: 'The suffering did not end with the announcement of the cease-fire. It continues to worsen daily. We must do more to support Gaza, advance the Strip hand in hand, and prepare for its reconstruction. This is the test that will ensure success.' Throughout the war, he consistently highlighted Gaza's suffering in his social media posts, and a month into the conflict, he described the situation there as a 'tragedy.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In one Instagram post, Masri emphasized that addressing Gaza's needs is 'primarily a Palestinian responsibility.'

Israel begins border negotiations with Lebanon, releases prisoner...	Israel and Lebanon began negotiations on land border, with Israel agreeing to release 5 Lebanese prisoners as a goodwill gesture; The talks, mediated by the US, aim to address several disputed points in southern Lebanon and on the border line Israel has released five Lebanese prisoners as part of ongoing negotiations with Lebanon over the land border between the two countries, Israeli officials said Tuesday. The decision, coordinated with the United States, was framed as a goodwill gesture to Lebanon’s newly elected president. Lebanese media reported that Israel had jailed several Lebanese nationals during the war and has transferred them back via the Red Cross. The identities of those who were released, as well as any potential ties to Hezbollah, remain unclear. The negotiations took place in the southern Lebanese town of Naqoura, with delegations from the IDF, Lebanon, the United States and France. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office reported in a statement that the talks resulted in the formation of three joint working groups aimed at stabilizing the region. These groups will focus on five areas in southern Lebanon under Israeli control, disputes over the U.N.-recognized Blue Line border, and the status of Lebanese detainees held by Israel. The negotiations have been ongoing with U.S. mediation since the end of the tenure of former U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein and continued under his successor, Morgan Ortagus, who has recently visited both Lebanon and Israel. Lebanese media also reported that a Lebanese soldier was 'kidnapped' by Israeli forces earlier this week. According to Al-Mayadeen, a Hezbollah-affiliated outlet, the soldier is among those set to be released. The handover is expected to take place at the Rosh Hanikra crossing following a meeting of the committee overseeing the U.N.-brokered cease-fire agreement.

New US envoy to Kuwait who denied Oct. 7 sexual violence, holds a...	President Donald Trump appointed Amer Ghalib, a Michigan mayor, who denied reports of Hamas-led sexual violence on Oct. 7 and initiated a vote calling for an economic boycott of companies working with 'Israeli apartheid' United States President Donald Trump on Monday appointed Hamtramck, Michigan, Mayor Amer Ghalib as the next U.S. ambassador to Kuwait. Ghalib, 45, a Yemeni-born Muslim immigrant, has been outspoken in his criticism of Israel. Just hours before his appointment he liked a comment on Facebook that described Jews as 'monkeys.' Ghalib made history in 2021 when he became the first Muslim mayor of Hamtramck. Since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, he has led several anti-Israel initiatives in the city, including a council vote to boycott companies that do business with what he called 'Israeli apartheid.' Following the decision, he stated that 'Palestine is fighting for a just cause' and claimed that 'the only ethical option for Israel is to admit defeat and leave the land.' Ghalib also supported renaming a city street 'Palestine Street' as an act of solidarity and cast the deciding vote in favor of the measure. He refused to condemn a local council candidate’s social media post comparing Israel’s actions to the Holocaust and dismissed reports of Hamas militants beheading and sexually assaulting victims on Oct. 7 as 'lies spread by the Biden administration to justify its support for Israel’s crimes.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In an open message at the time to then-President Joe Biden, he said :You fueled (these) kind of hate crimes and Islamophobia by spreading false information and lies (e.g. beheaded babies and raped women).' Ghalib continued: 'You make us feel unsafe by trying to justify your support for the criminal and unethical attack on the civilians of Gaza using lies and made up stories. Be a man and apologize for your moral and historic downfall, otherwise the blood of thousands of children and innocent people will be a curse that will follow you to your grave.' Ghalib also has previously referred to Saddam Hussein, who invaded Kuwait in 1990, as a 'martyr.' Ghalib met with Trump in September, praising him as a 'man of principle who opposes wars' and helping mobilize Muslim voters ahead of the U.S. presidential election. However, he later said he disagreed with Trump’s proposal for the U.S. to take control of Gaza. Trump, for his part, lauded Ghalib on Monday, calling him 'the greatest mayor in the world, who won’t let men participate in women’s sports' — a reference to Trump’s opposition to transgender rights. In 2023, Hamtramck’s city council voted to ban pride flags and other social or political flags from government buildings, a move that sparked public backlash. Announcing the appointment, Trump said Ghalib was chosen in part because of his role in helping secure victory in Michigan, a key battleground state with the highest percentage of Arab American residents in the country. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1mv5ypj1e	2025-03-11T07:48:46-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/10/B1pJoo2jye/B1pJoo2jye_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

IDF prepares to release 14,000 draft notices for young Haredi men...	Response to call-up of 10,000 Haredim since June has been dismal so far - under 200; the IDF will focus on communities and cities where enlistment rates were higher in earlier draft rounds; Ultra-Orthodox call it a 'war against yeshivot' The Israel Defense Forces are preparing in the coming days to issue 14,000 draft notices to young ultra-Orthodox men. These orders will add to the roughly 10,000 already sent since last June, though the response so far has been extremely limited. The military plans to incorporate lessons learned from earlier draft rounds and focus on communities and cities where enlistment rates were higher. According to data presented Monday at the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, of 3,000 draft orders issued last summer, only 160 ultra-Orthodox men have enlisted to date. In November 2024, an additional 7,000 summonses were approved, resulting in just 17 enlistments so far. Several hundred more are currently undergoing various stages of the enlistment process. Sixty-five individuals are under arrest orders, and more than 2,000 are under Order 12, which requires immediate enlistment. Those who fail to report to the draft office within the number of days specified are subject to a travel ban and may be arrested if they encounter police. The IDF intends to improve the effectiveness of future draft rounds, though no significant changes are expected in the way the notices are delivered or in how officials interact with draft candidates, beyond adjustments made to date. On Tuesday morning, ultra-Orthodox newspapers published notices calling for prayers on Thursday in response to what was described as 'a war against the world of yeshivas.' The announcements, appearing in publications such as Yated Ne’eman and HaMevaser, declared, 'At a time when war has been declared against the world of Torah learning, with schemes to conscript Torah scholars — God forbid — and many other decrees upon the Torah world, the Jewish people have only the power of prayer. It is our duty to plead with the Creator of all worlds and to seek mercy on His people. Therefore, we will all gather for a day of prayer on the Fast of Esther.' The notice went on to call for 'coming before the King, assembling and standing up for our souls in communal prayer throughout the world, asking for the sake of the Torah world and for each and every one of its scholars. ‘Our Father, our King, nullify from upon us all evil and harsh decrees.’' The notice also said that, on the Fast of Esther, 'Men, women and children will gather to recite Psalms and prayers. Yeshiva students will increase their Torah study, crying out on behalf of the Torah world and all Israel who are in distress and captivity, and the Holy One, Blessed be He, will have mercy on us and redeem us from all our troubles. May we merit a great salvation as in the days of Mordechai and Esther.' Meanwhile, the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee continued its debates on the proposed legislation that would formalize draft exemptions for ultra-Orthodox men. Tensions rose when one participant shouted at Knesset lawmaker Yinon Azoulay of the Shas Party, calling him 'insolent' and was subsequently removed from the hearing. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'There’s an agreement from the rabbis that I sit here to ensure that those who are not learning in yeshiva will enlist, but that they stay in a framework appropriate to the ultra-Orthodox community, one that’s good for them,' Azoulay responded. The attendee replied: 'No one asks my children, and no one wraps them in cotton wool like that. Insolent!' Azoulay responded: 'You won’t call me insolent. Shame on you. I have the Torah, and it protects no less. Don’t argue with my faith.' Laly Deri, whose son, Staff Sgt. (res.) Sa’adia Yaakov, who studied at the hesder yeshiva in Jaffa, was killed by a mortar strike in central Gaza on June 20, 2024, also took part in the discussion. 'I prayed this issue of drafting my ultra-Orthodox brothers would come from within, through mutual responsibility. I prayed for it, but sadly, it isn’t happening,' she said. Since her son’s death, Deri has become a prominent advocate for drafting ultra-Orthodox men. 'We’ve been discussing this law for 16 months. In that time, we could have drafted so many people who could have contributed to the war effort, but it’s not happening. I wanted it to come from a place of ‘we will do and we will listen,’ but it turns out it has to be forced like Mount Sinai over our heads. This law is urgent. Not only was my son’s spirituality not harmed in the IDF, he grew there. We have no choice but to demand personal sanctions,' she said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkp4rppi1e	2025-03-11T07:13:01-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2018/03/14/8406271/8406271_0_78_1300_790_0_small.jpg

Israeli forces kill two terrorists in Jenin and arrested 10, including senior operative; In Lebanon, President Aoun urges UN officials to pressure Israel to withdraw from five strategic points amid cease-fire tensions An Israeli drone strike targeted a vehicle in southern Lebanon on Monday afternoon, according to reports from the country. The strike occurred between Deir al-Zahrani and Roumine, with local reports indicating that one person was killed. Lebanese reports stated that the man was a senior operative in Hezbollah's aerial defense unit. At the same time, five Palestinians were reportedly killed in an Israeli drone strike in the Netzarim corridor area in the Gaza Strip. Earlier in the day, following the most extensive wave of Israeli airstrikes in Syria in more than two months, another attack was reported in the country. According to Syrian media, the latest Israeli strike targeted the al-Khalhalah military airport near al-Suwayda in southern Syria. Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces continued operations in the northern West Bank. A joint statement from the IDF, the Shin Bet security agency, and the police said that counterterrorism units, including the elite Yamam and Duvdevan forces, carried out raids in Jenin and Qabatiya, killing armed terrorists and arresting a senior member of a terrorist cell in the area. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: During the operation in Jenin, Israeli forces encountered armed gunmen barricaded inside a building. Two terrorists were killed in the ensuing firefight, while a third was wounded. Security forces also arrested 10 other suspects, including Liwaa Jaaz, a senior operative in the Jenin-based terror network. Separately, Duvdevan forces killed another gunman who had opened fire on them. Israeli troops also located two vehicles in Jenin containing weapons intended for attacks and destroyed them. According to Palestinian reports, a 58-year-old woman was killed by Israeli gunfire in Jenin earlier in the day. Despite a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah, the IDF has continued striking targets in Lebanon to prevent violations of the deal and to stop weapons transfers aimed at rebuilding Hezbollah's military capabilities. The Iran-backed group has suffered significant losses in the fighting, weakening its internal standing in Lebanon. Under the ceasefire terms, the Lebanese military is required to take control of areas in southern Lebanon previously under Hezbollah’s authority. While the IDF has withdrawn from most of the territory, it remains stationed at five strategic locations. On Monday, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun urged the head of the UN ceasefire monitoring committee to pressure Israel to withdraw from these positions and release Lebanese prisoners. In Gaza, the temporary cease-fire has officially ended, though both sides have largely refrained from renewed fighting as mediators work to extend the truce. Israel is pushing for further hostage releases as a condition for maintaining the ceasefire. However, the IDF has continued targeting terrorists identified as attempting to plant explosives or approaching Israeli forces operating in the buffer zone and the Philadelphi Corridor. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1leiiasyl	2025-03-11T04:11:59-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/11/H1r0pqTsye/H1r0pqTsye_0_315_961_541_0_small.jpg

Local sources say pact with community leaders in al-Suwayda will reintegrate the province into state institutions after years of unrest Syria’s government has reportedly reached an agreement with Druze leaders in the southern province of al-Suwayda, marking a significant shift in the region’s relationship with Damascus after years of unrest. However, no official confirmation of the deal has been issued. According to Qatar-based Al-Araby, local sources say the agreement between the Syrian government and community leaders in al-Suwayda will reintegrate the province into state institutions. As part of the deal, 300 security personnel will be deployed to the province. Additionally, 600 local residents whose legal status was settled will be reinstated into the police force. The Syrian government has already appointed a new police commander and a deputy in al-Suwayda, while a second deputy will be selected from the province’s Druze population, according to the report. The agreement comes amid broader efforts by Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa to consolidate control over autonomous regions. A separate deal signed Monday with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) will see Kurdish forces merge with the Syrian military and place key Kurdish-controlled institutions, including border crossings, prisons, and oil fields, under government authority. Kurdish forces to join Syrian government Under the agreement with the SDF, the Kurdish population will be granted constitutional recognition as an 'indigenous community' in Syria. The deal also requires Kurdish leaders to support efforts to combat remaining Assad loyalists and other security threats while rejecting any aspirations for independence.

Court orders total gag order on explosive ‘Qatar-Gate’ investigat...	Israeli court grants police request to prohibit publication of any details on probe, centering on alleged ties between associates of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatar About two weeks after Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara announced the opening of a criminal investigation into the 'Qatar-Gate' affair—centering on ties between associates of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatar, Hamas' primary financial backer and a mediator in hostage negotiations—a comprehensive gag order has been issued on the case. The Rishon Lezion Magistrates' Court granted the police's request to prohibit the publication of any details of the investigation, including findings, interrogations of suspects, and evidence gathered. The case is being handled by the National Unit for International Investigations within Lahav 433, Israel's top police anti-corruption and serious crime unit. According to the ruling, the publication ban applies to all forms of media, including social networks, excerpts from foreign news reports, references to them, online platforms, and any other media. The restriction extends to both direct and indirect hints regarding the investigation. Two weeks ago, Baharav-Miara stated that the probe would be conducted by the Israel Police and the Shin Bet security agency. The case focuses on three close associates of Netanyahu: Eli Feldstein, a spokesperson who has already been investigated and indicted in a separate case involving leaked classified documents. Jonathan Urich, an adviser and spokesperson also implicated in the classified documents case, where he allegedly corresponded directly with Feldstein regarding the leaked material. Israel Einhorn, a campaign consultant involved in Likud's election efforts. Allegations and connections to Qatar Before the attorney general's decision to launch a formal investigation, authorities were examining security and counterintelligence breaches. The decision to authorize Shin Bet to interrogate suspects under caution—rather than merely as witnesses—suggests potential criminal elements. According to reports, Feldstein received payments from an international private company to manage a public relations campaign aimed at improving Qatar’s image in Israel. His work focused on hostage negotiations, and he allegedly facilitated interviews between journalists and Qatari officials, relayed official statements on Qatar’s behalf, and promoted messages regarding its regional role. This was happening while he also worked in the Prime Minister's Office—at a time when Netanyahu was publicly criticizing Qatar for 'serving Hamas.' Urich and Einhorn reportedly provided public relations consulting to Qatar in Israel. In 2022, they designed a campaign ahead of the FIFA World Cup, aiming to portray Qatar—a country that finances and supports terrorism—as a legitimate state committed to peace and regional stability. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The campaign was managed by Einhorn’s company, 'Perception,' which collaborated on the Qatari project with another firm, 'Coyos,' co-owned by Brig. Gen. (Res.) Eli Ben-Meir. Ben-Meir, a former head of the IDF Military Intelligence Research Division, currently holds a sensitive position in the army and was responsible for intelligence reviews following the October 7 Hamas attack. Reports indicate Feldstein was also employed by Einhorn’s firm, though it is unclear if he was involved in the Qatari PR campaign. Netanyahu's response and political fallout All individuals mentioned in the investigation have denied any wrongdoing. Netanyahu has dismissed the probe as a 'witch hunt' aimed at undermining him and his associates. Opposition leaders have warned that Netanyahu may attempt to dismiss Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar in retaliation for the investigation. Following the attorney general’s announcement, Likud issued a statement saying: 'As the fabricated cases against Prime Minister Netanyahu collapse in court, new and baseless cases are being fabricated against his associates for personal and political reasons. We see right through it.' There is no evidence that payments to Netanyahu’s aides influenced his decision to allow Qatar to transfer cash to Gaza. Netanyahu has maintained that the funds were intended to assist impoverished residents in the enclave, not Hamas. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rygvzqpiyx	2025-03-11T02:48:21-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/r1rAKDiFJe/r1rAKDiFJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Help bring daddy home from Gaza': Hostage’s daughters appeal to ...	Lishi Lavi-Miran shares video of her daughters pleading for help in securing their father Omri's release; she criticizes Netanyahu for not fulfilling promises on hostage negotiations, urges public to join protests for their return Lishi Lavi-Miran, whose husband, Omri Miran, has been held hostage by Hamas for 522 days, posted a video Monday on her X account. The video features her two young daughters, Roni and Alma, addressing former U.S. President Donald Trump: 'Help us bring Daddy back from Gaza. Thank you.' The girls also say in the video that they will give their father 'kisses and lots of hugs' and later draw a large heart for him on paper. Lishi also wrote directly to Trump in a post: 'Dear Donald Trump, my daughters talk about you all the time. They know you are the one who can bring fathers home to their children. Please help us bring Omri and all the other hostages back to their families. We trust you. Thank you.' Speaking to Ynetnews on Tuesday morning, Lishi explained why she decided to post the video. 'It’s always difficult for me to expose my daughters, but we’ve reached this point. We are fighting for Omri’s life, for the life of my daughters’ father, and for them to have a normal reality,' she said. She criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for failing to follow through on his promises regarding the second phase of the hostage deal. 'The prime minister promised me and all of us, a month and a half ago, before the agreement began, that it was a comprehensive deal and that only specific details needed to be finalized for the second phase,' she said. 'We are now entering our second consecutive weekend without our loved ones returning—neither the living nor the remains of the deceased—and he is not keeping his promises.' Lishi stressed that she had never supported a phased deal. 'None of us wanted this deal to be done in stages—except, apparently, for the decision-makers in Israel, who thought it was the right approach. I accepted it. I said that we need to start in order to finish,' she said. 'We started, but then we stopped. For some reason, everything has halted. So I am reaching out to anyone I can—whether at the UN last week, to Trump, to our prime minister, to Hungary because Omri is a Hungarian citizen—whoever I can. I will do everything I can to bring Omri and all 58 hostages still in Gaza home.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Lishi also emphasized the need to end the war. 'We know for certain that the fighting is endangering the lives of the hostages. We can no longer avoid this reality. We can’t say, ‘We didn’t know,’' she said. 'This war should have ended long ago, for many reasons. One of them is to bring everyone back—Omri and all 58 hostages still there—and to allow all the reservists who have been carrying this burden for too long to return home. We cannot continue to normalize this situation. We have been at war for a year and a half, and we see no end in sight.' Regarding Omri’s condition, Lishi said: 'We don’t know how he is. We do know that one of the released hostages was with him in July. That was the last time we received any indication that he was alive. People tell me, ‘But that was July!’ And I say, ‘Yes, but that’s better than before, because the last time before that was in late April.’ So at least now we know he was alive as of the end of July.' She also shared that Omri had been kept in the dark about his family’s survival for months. 'We know he had some information in the past, that he knew the girls and I were alive. But we recently discovered that until our press conference following the release of his hostage video, he didn’t know for sure that I had survived. We can only imagine what it’s like to be told that your wife and two daughters were murdered, and then a day later, to be told they weren’t—playing mind games with him. Beyond the physical torture and abuse we know all the hostages are enduring, there is also severe psychological terror. Only in early May did Omri finally know for sure that the girls and I had survived and that we were fighting for him.' With Purim approaching in two days, Lishi noted how difficult it is to face another holiday without her husband. 'I’m about to celebrate Alma’s second birthday. When this hostage deal began, I told myself, ‘It’s happening soon—Omri will be here for Alma’s birthday.’ According to the signed agreement, he was supposed to be home by now. But right now, I am far from certain—if anything, I’m sure he won’t be,' she said. 'Omri turns 48 on April 11, exactly one month from now. Will he mark the day? Will he celebrate? No one is giving us any answers.' She concluded by calling on the public to join the ongoing protest near the Kirya military headquarters in Tel Aviv. 'Come, join us, be with us. Not just in your hearts, not just in your prayers—but through action,' she urged. 'Don’t go out celebrating Purim because we still have nothing to celebrate. The Book of Esther is more relevant than ever this year. The children deserve to celebrate, to breathe, and we must give them as much normalcy as possible. But we adults have nothing to celebrate. Thousands of orphaned children, hundreds of bereaved families, and 59 hostages still in Gaza. Remember that.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjs2nkpoyx	2025-03-11T02:26:26-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/11/S1B03u6okg/S1B03u6okg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
U.S. shifts stance on hostage deal, from ‘all or nothing’ to phas...	Jerusalem prioritizes release of injured hostages; terror group resists disarmament, while families voice frustration over delays; Witkoff pushes for deal, with negotiations focusing on temporary cease-fire extension in exchange for releases The framework for a hostage release deal remains uncertain, with proposals ranging from freeing half of the 59 living and deceased hostages at once to releasing 10 living captives without mention of the fallen. While U.S. President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum to Hamas demanding the release of all hostages—calling it their 'final warning'—negotiations in Doha suggest discussions are focused on freeing a much smaller number. At the beginning of the month, Israel announced its agreement to the framework proposed by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. According to this plan, which was first revealed in an official statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, the first phase would see the release of half of the living and deceased hostages. If an agreement on a permanent cease-fire were reached, the remaining hostages—both living and deceased—would be freed in a later phase. Initially, this meant the release of approximately 11 living hostages and 19 bodies. Hamas rejects initial proposal, new version on the table Hamas quickly rejected this plan, leading to a revised proposal, also spearheaded by Witkoff. The updated framework calls for the release of 10 living hostages, including American citizen Idan Alexander and nine others reportedly subjected to torture. While this number is similar to the original plan, there has been little mention in negotiations of the earlier demand to release the bodies of hostages. Under the current proposal, the cease-fire would be extended through the end of Ramadan and Passover, and Israel would resume humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s Al-Akhbar newspaper, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, reported that Egyptian diplomatic sources say the most viable deal under discussion involves the release of 10 living hostages in exchange for a 60-day cease-fire. During this period, large quantities of humanitarian aid would be allowed into Gaza, and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails would be freed. The report also claims that to avoid tensions within Israel, the released hostages would not be publicly celebrated or paraded upon their return. Israel pushes for injured and sick hostages first Israel’s negotiating team, which arrived in Qatar with a mandate to advance the Witkoff framework, is also exploring ways to extend the first phase of the deal to secure additional releases. Israel's position is that priority should be given to releasing hostages who are injured or ill. Previously, there had been discussions about prioritizing the release of four fathers of young children: David Cunio, Omri Miran, Elkana Buhbout, and Maxim Herkin. Israeli officials said, 'If we see that the Witkoff framework is not viable and no agreement is reached, Israel will seek to extend the first phase or create an interim deal as a bridge to the Witkoff plan.' This would mean multiple release phases in exchange for temporary cease-fire extensions, with the exact number of hostages freed, the timeline, and other details still to be determined. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israel’s negotiating team, led by a senior Shin Bet official, arrived in Doha on Monday. Other members include hostage and missing persons coordinator Gal Hirsch, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s foreign policy adviser Ophir Falk, and representatives from Mossad, Shin Bet, and the IDF. Talks resumed after the Ramadan fast-breaking meal (Iftar) and are expected to continue for two days. Witkoff is expected to arrive in Doha today to push for progress in negotiations. While he is not currently scheduled to visit Israel, it is possible he could do so unexpectedly if necessary to convince Netanyahu to agree to certain aspects of the deal. U.S. involvement and Hamas’ stance The negotiations are taking place against the backdrop of direct talks between Hamas and Trump’s special envoy for hostage affairs, Adam Boehler. These talks have drawn criticism in both Israel and the United States. Boehler’s discussions primarily focused on securing the release of Alexander, though four other American citizens—Omer Naotrah, Itai Chen, Judy Weinstein Haggai, and her husband Gadi Haggai (who were killed on October 7)—remain in captivity. Israeli officials believe Boehler’s talks with senior Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya have not contributed positively to negotiations, and even White House officials are reportedly dissatisfied with the results. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said yesterday that the direct talks with Hamas were a 'one-time event' and admitted they had not yielded results. Meanwhile, the London-based Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper reported that Hamas has made clear it has not committed to disarmament under any deal, calling it an 'internal Palestinian matter.' According to sources, Hamas told Boehler they would only consider disarming if a clear political path to a Palestinian state were established. Families of hostages speak out The slow progress in negotiations has left families of the hostages frustrated. Yael Ader, whose son Tamir Ader was murdered on October 7 while defending Kibbutz Nir Oz, expressed her frustration in an interview with Ynet. His body remains in Gaza. 'They’re talking about a two-month cease-fire for 10 hostages. It feels like they’re telling the families of the fallen: ‘You’re on hold.’ And for the living hostages, they’re playing Solomon’s trial, deciding who is more important or more humanitarian to save,' she said. Ader added, 'I hope someone will stand up and say, ‘We’re bringing all 59 home.’ But I’m also deeply afraid because I see where the government is headed. It doesn’t want to resolve this for reasons tied to other political interests. Right now, it’s the Americans who are the only ones demanding that everyone be released.' 'But they’re promising hell, and we’re the only ones who can deliver it,' she added. 'They expect us to send our forces into battle. It’s a problematic paradox.' Referring to Trump’s ultimatum, she noted: 'Even Trump, at some point, will say, ‘I said my piece—now Netanyahu has to decide.’ The prime minister must decide that ending this crisis is the most important thing, even if it means not passing the March budget or that his coalition collapses. Bringing the hostages home is what matters most to Israeli society right now.' Ader also criticized Israel’s handling of the crisis, pointing out that U.S. officials have been more responsive than the Israeli government. 'I have Israeli citizenship—why should I have to turn to the U.S. for help? My son went to defend Israel’s border, not America’s. I’m grateful to the Americans, but the effort should be coming from Israel’s prime minister,' she said. 'Even Witkoff—when I reach out to him, he responds. Israel’s prime minister? Unreachable. Something here doesn’t make sense.'

White House: 'Shalom, Mahmoud'; judge halts deportation of Columb...	ICE sends Mahmoud Khalil to detention facility in Jena, Louisiana - notorious for reports of mistreatment of detainees, civil rights violations, and unexplained deaths U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the arrest of a Columbia University graduate and a leader of pro-Palestinian protests on campus, promising that 'there is much more to come.' 'Shalom, Mahmoud,' read the official White House post, which went on to proudly detail the Saturday arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a former student and organizer of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia. Hours later, a federal judge in New York ruled that Khalil would not be deported from the U.S. for the time being. Federal Judge Jesse Furman ruled that Khalil should not be deported in order to 'preserve the court’s jurisdiction.' A hearing on petitions for his release from detention was scheduled for Wednesday. Before the court ruling, Trump had already expressed satisfaction with the arrest, calling it 'the first of many to come.' Khalil, who earned a master's degree from Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs in December, was arrested in New York by immigration agents and transported thousands of miles from his home to a detention facility in Jena, Louisiana. The facility has been notorious for reports of mistreatment of detainees, civil rights violations, and unexplained deaths. Arrest sparks outrage and political debate Khalil’s arrest has angered his supporters while providing the Trump administration with an opportunity to showcase its hardline stance against pro-Palestinian protesters at elite U.S. universities. Although he completed his studies, a Ynet investigation found that Khalil was seen last week negotiating on behalf of students who had barricaded themselves inside Barnard College, Columbia’s affiliated women’s college. A viral video showed him holding a megaphone and chastising the university’s president. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Public reaction to his arrest was swift. Khalil, a Green Card holder married to an American citizen in the late stages of pregnancy, received widespread support. A petition demanding his release gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures within hours, while politicians and human rights groups condemned the move. His supporters claim the charges against him are politically motivated rather than legitimate immigration violations. 'This is an abuse of immigration law for the sake of political persecution,' said his attorney, Amy Greer, who vowed to appeal the arrest. While some legal experts question the legality of the move and whether it constitutes selective enforcement for political purposes, the Trump administration has made its stance clear: 'We will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country — never to return again.' Khalil’s plea for protection before arrest A day before his arrest, Khalil sent an email to Columbia University President Katrina Armstrong, pleading with her to intervene and offer him protection. Armstrong did not respond to his request. In his letter, Khalil claimed he was the target of a 'coordinated and ruthless smear campaign' by pro-Israel activists, including Israeli professor Shai Davidai and the U.S. branch of the Betar movement, who had called for his deportation and, according to him, 'threatened his life.' 'I can’t sleep at night, fearing that immigration agents or a dangerous individual will come to my home,' Khalil wrote. 'I urgently need legal support, and I am calling on you to intervene and provide the necessary protections to prevent further harm.' His fears intensified after reports surfaced that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents had been seen on campus in the past week. A university-issued document warned staff that they could not intervene if immigration agents sought access to school grounds without a warrant. 'I have outlined the broader context,' Khalil wrote, 'yet Columbia has failed to provide any meaningful support or resources in response to this escalating threat.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjhquupjkl	2025-03-11T00:56:43-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/09/B1AbHtssJe/B1AbHtssJe_1_144_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Taliban lifts TV channel ban, but press freedom in Afghanistan re...	As the Taliban reopens previously shuttered media outlets in Afghanistan, experts warn that the move is more about exerting control than restoring independent journalism The Taliban has granted permission for a private television channel to resume operations after nearly three months of suspension, the Afghanistan Journalists Center (AFJC) said earlier this month. The body welcomed the decision and urged the Taliban to ensure that media outlets in Afghanistan can operate freely, without restrictions or threats. The AFJC, a nongovernmental organization advocating for press freedom, announced in a statement that the Taliban’s Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice had granted permission to the privately owned Arezo TV channel to return to the air. Arezo TV is an Afghan satellite television network primarily broadcasting in the Dari language. Launched in 2007 in northern Afghanistan’s Mazar-e-Sharif, the channel initially catered to a regional audience before expanding its reach nationwide. It also operates a radio station within the country. On December 4, 2024, Arezo TV’s Kabul office was raided by Taliban intelligence and morality police. According to the AFJC, before the office was sealed, staff members were mistreated, electronic devices and computers were confiscated, and seven employees were arrested, in what it called a 'clear violation' of independent media rights. Two weeks later, on December 21, authorities freed the detained employees from the infamous Pul-e-Charkhi prison. The employees had to promise in writing to remain in Kabul and appear in court. Now that the court has ruled not guilty, the workers face no barriers to resuming their jobs. Basir Abid, head of the channel’s Kabul office, told the AFJC that all employees were allowed to return to work without any conditions. The spokesperson for the Ministry of Vice and Virtue, Saif-ul-Islam Khyber, told The Media Line that the station’s closure was necessary to 'preserve Islamic values, prevent media misuse, and maintain social order.' He claimed that an investigation revealed Arezo TV had misused its name and resources, employing 'unofficial individuals' to produce and air content that allegedly violated Islamic principles and Afghan traditions. An official from the Ministry of Information and Culture who asked to remain anonymous told The Media Line that Arezo TV was shut down because of 'dubbing Indian ‘vulgar’ dramas and malicious contents from Iranian media based abroad into local languages.' 'The station’s management has now assured authorities that such contents will not be aired again and that future programming will focus on Afghan culture and Islamic values,' the official said. The AFJC voiced serious concerns over the growing restrictions on media operations, calling on the Taliban to uphold Afghanistan’s Media Law. As recognized by the Ministry of Information and Culture, this law affirms that media outlets have the right to operate freely without undue interference or threats. Arezo TV is far from the only channel to be affected by the Taliban’s censorship. In early February, the Taliban suspended Radio Begum, Afghanistan’s only women-run radio station, accusing it of violating domestic broadcasting regulations and unlawfully distributing content to a foreign TV channel. Later that month, Afghan authorities announced the channel’s reinstatement. Radio Begum began broadcasting on International Women’s Day in March 2021, just five months before the Taliban regained power. The channel’s content is produced entirely by Afghan women. The station’s sister channel, Begum TV, operates from France, airing educational programs for students in grades seven to 12. Since the Taliban banned girls’ education beyond the sixth grade, many Afghan girls are now deprived of schooling. In a conversation with The Media Line, Taliban chief spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid stated that 'there are no formal restrictions on media in the country.' He emphasized the importance of media outlets adhering to national interests and Islamic values and cautioned against the spread of unverified claims and rumors. Since the Taliban’s return to power, press freedom in Afghanistan has deteriorated significantly. The Taliban’s Ministry of Vice and Virtue enforces rigid content guidelines, banning reports deemed 'against Islamic values' or critical of the regime. Foreign media access has also been restricted, further isolating Afghanistan’s press. Afghanistan plunged to 178th out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders’ 2024 World Press Freedom Index, a stark decline from its 152nd position in 2023. Independent journalism has also become increasingly difficult under Taliban rule, as media outlets face strict censorship, intimidation, and financial hardship. Reporters who cover sensitive topics, including human rights abuses, women’s rights, or security issues, risk harassment, detention, or worse. Many journalists have been arrested, interrogated, or even physically assaulted for their work. Several media companies have been shut down for failing to comply with Taliban-imposed restrictions, while others operate under constant fear, leading to widespread self-censorship. The situation is especially dire for female journalists. The Taliban has barred adult women from education and severely restricted their participation in the workforce and public life. Female journalists have been systematically removed from their positions, with many attempting to flee the country. Gulalai Zarmina, a former news director at a Persian-language channel, is now a refugee in a neighboring country, after being forced to flee with her family. 'Since the fall of Afghanistan, women and girls in the media have been silenced, confined to their homes,' Zarmina told The Media Line. She endured such isolation in Afghanistan for two weeks before realizing that staying silent meant surrendering to censorship. Determined to return to work, she contacted her television station, but she was warned against returning—going back to work was simply too dangerous. Zarmina, a fierce critic of the Taliban who spoke out against the group during Ashraf Ghani’s presidency, found herself a target after the government fell in 2021. When her brother informed her that Taliban intelligence was asking about her, she and her family felt they had no choice but to flee the country. Reflecting on the state of journalism under Taliban rule, Zarmina painted a grim picture of an industry stripped of its independence. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Journalistic content, language, and even references to former Afghan officials are all tightly controlled, Zarmina said. 'No one dares to speak against the Taliban,' she explained. 'Guests refuse to appear on television out of fear, and even hosts tread cautiously, knowing a single misstep could have dire consequences.' Arash Yaqin, a former UN adviser for the Afghan Foreign Ministry now based in Washington, told The Media Line that Afghanistan used to have substantial press freedom. 'Before the Taliban’s return, the media fearlessly scrutinized those in power, from the president down to the lowest officials,' he said. 'Now, that era of press freedom has vanished.' While the Taliban’s core policies have remained largely unchanged since the 1990s, the group’s approach to media has shifted, Yaqin said. 'They once enforced a near-total blackout, but now they exploit the media to shape narratives and influence young Afghans through jihadi propaganda,' he said. With that in mind, the return to air of Afghanistan’s women-run radio station should be seen not as a concession but as 'calculated tactic,' Yaqin said. 'While it projects an illusion of media freedom, strict control ensures it serves the Taliban’s agenda,' he explained. 'It wouldn’t be surprising if soon Afghan women are heard praising the Taliban for ‘bringing peace’ and ‘ensuring their rights’—claims far removed from reality.' Turning the women-owned radio station into a mouthpiece for the Taliban would also be financially beneficial to Afghanistan, since such stations are often funded by international donors, he continued. Speaking from an undisclosed location, Afghan media rights activist Elaha Sekandary similarly told The Media Line that the Taliban’s decision to allow media stations to reopen 'comes with conditions attached.' 'These outlets will now operate under the Taliban’s strict guidelines, ensuring their content aligns with the regime’s policies,' she said. By exerting control over media under the pretext of aligning it with Islamic regulations, the Taliban seek to present itself as media-friendly while maintaining strict oversight, she explained. She noted that the Taliban is keenly aware of shifting global politics, particularly with the return of President Donald Trump, whose stance on Afghanistan could pose challenges to the regime’s stability. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ugkwpo1x	2025-03-10T23:31:56-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2021/08/22/SknVuDk11F/SknVuDk11F_0_169_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Palestinain car thief breaks into military base, injures soldier	IDF says soldier was injured moderately and taken to nearby hospital; incident under investigation; authorities rule out terror-related motive An undocumented Palestinian from Jenin stole a car Tuesday morning from the Tel Aviv area, broke through a military base checkpoint in Tzrifin, injured a soldier moderately, and was arrested in Ramla after a chase. Authorities said the incident was not terror-related. The Israel Defense Forces said the soldier 'was injured by a vehicle at the entrance gate checkpoint of Tzrifin Base, and the incident is under investigation.' The soldier was taken to a hospital for medical treatment, and his family was notified. After stealing the car, the suspect drove onto Route 44 and turned right toward Tzrifin. He rammed through the checkpoint, drove inside the base for several minutes, then returned to the checkpoint, where he struck a man in his 20s. Despite attempts to stop him, the suspect fled back to Route 44 and continued east toward Ramla, where he was finally apprehended by local police at the Ice Junction in the city. He was taken in for questioning and is expected to appear in court later Tuesday for a remand hearing.

UN Security Council to meet over Iran's growing stockpile of near...	Council members also request discussion on Tehran's obligation to provide nuclear watchdog with information and access to sites The United Nations Security Council will meet behind closed doors on Wednesday over Iran's expansion of its stock of uranium close to weapons grade, diplomats said on Monday. The meeting was requested by six of the council's 15 members - France, Greece, Panama, South Korea, Britain and the U.S. They also want the council to discuss Iran's obligation to provide the U.N. nuclear watchdog - the International Atomic Energy Agency - with 'the information necessary to clarify outstanding issues related to undeclared nuclear material detected at multiple locations in Iran,' diplomats said. Iran's mission to the U.N. in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the planned meeting. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Iran has denied wanting to develop a nuclear weapon. However, it is 'dramatically' accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% weapons-grade level, the IAEA has warned. Western states say there is no need to enrich uranium to such a high level under any civilian program and that no other country has done so without producing nuclear bombs. Iran says its nuclear program is peaceful. Iran reached a deal in 2015 with Britain, Germany, France, the U.S., Russia and China - known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action - that lifted sanctions on Tehran in return for restrictions on its nuclear program. Washington quit the agreement in 2018 during Donald Trump's first term as U.S. president, and Iran began moving away from its nuclear-related commitments. Britain, France and Germany have told the U.N.

Israel conducts largest airstrike in Syria in months, targeting n...	Israeli officials view Interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa’s regime as security threat, citing its ties to jihadist groups and potential Turkish military influence; attacks come amid concerns Hamas, Islamic Jihad could use Syria as base for attacks In the most extensive Israeli airstrike in Syria in over two months, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) carried out dozens of attacks from Monday night into early Tuesday, striking military sites affiliated with Interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa’s regime. According to the IDF, the strikes in southern Syria targeted radar installations, aerial detection systems, and military headquarters, as well as weapons depots and other military infrastructure used by the new regime. The IDF stated that 'the presence of these systems in southern Syria poses a threat to Israel and to IDF operations. These targets were struck to eliminate future threats.' The wave of strikes marks the most significant Israeli military action in Syria in recent months, as Israel seeks to counter the growing military presence of the new regime. Syrian reports indicated that the strikes targeted military outposts in the Damascus countryside, including the towns of Sa’sa and Qatana, as well as former military positions in the Daraa region and the Syrian army’s 90th Brigade in the Quneitra countryside. Additional attacks were reported near Homs and along the Lebanese border. In total, at least 41 airstrikes were reported in the Damascus countryside alone. Growing concern over new regime’s military activity Ynet security analyst Ron Ben-Yishai noted that the recent massacre carried out by forces loyal to al-Sharaa in Alawite cities in western Syria has reinforced Israel’s assessment that the new regime poses an emerging threat requiring preemptive action. Israel is concerned not only about jihadist groups within Syria but also about the country becoming a hub of fragile political stability that could allow Turkey to expand its military influence in the region. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: One of the most pressing threats is the potential for Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad to use Syrian territory as a base for attacks against Israeli communities in the Golan Heights and Upper Galilee. Forces loyal to al-Sharaa have released senior terrorists, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad operatives, whom Bashar Assad had previously imprisoned to prevent them from launching attacks against Israel. There is growing concern that these operatives are already planning terrorist activities. Another major concern is that Turkey may begin supplying and training jihadist forces aligned with the new regime. With these threats in mind, Israel is working to shape the reality in southern Syria to prevent the new regime from consolidating power near its border. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz have made it clear that Israel will not allow regime-backed militants to move south, nor will it tolerate armed Sunni jihadists operating near the Syrian Golan. Many abandoned Syrian military outposts in the region remain stocked with weapons, raising fears that they could fall into hostile hands. Al-Sharaa strikes agreement with Kurdish forces At the same time, al-Sharaa has moved to strengthen his rule. On Monday night, he announced an agreement with the commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to integrate Kurdish fighters into Syrian state institutions and the military. The agreement followed a meeting between al-Sharaa and SDF leadership, whose forces are backed by the United States. The decision to incorporate Kurdish forces came after they were excluded from last month’s 'National Dialogue Conference,' which aimed to establish a framework for Syria’s future governance. According to al-Sharaa’s office, the agreement reaffirms 'the unity of Syrian territory and the rejection of its division.' As part of the deal, the SDF pledged to support Syria in combating remnants of the Assad regime and other security threats. The agreement effectively ends any Kurdish aspirations for an independent state—at least within Syria—due to their commitment to preserving the country’s territorial integrity. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1wacu6jjg	2025-03-10T22:55:00-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/r1rTo6NEyl/r1rTo6NEyl_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Houthis threaten to renew hostilities 'immediately' after Gaza de...	Israeli officials fear Iranian proxy threats could signal broader regional escalation, potentially involving other Iran-backed groups; U.S. is expected to take stronger stance against terror group, with heightened military coordination in Red Sea Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels said Tuesday that their deadline for allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza had expired and warned they could resume attacks on ships linked to Israel in the Red Sea. Houthi leader Abdul-Malik Badr al-Din al-Houthi said the group was 'standing by its commitment' to enforce the ultimatum and that its forces were 'prepared for action.' He warned that 'military measures will begin immediately' if aid deliveries to Gaza are not resumed. The deadline, first announced last week, gave four days for humanitarian shipments to reach Gaza. On Monday, senior Houthi official Nasser al-Din Amer reiterated that any renewed attacks would be focused on maritime operations. 'The leader sent a message to mediators and the enemy before the deadline expired, limiting the threat to naval actions,' he said. 'If the Americans decide to support the Israeli enemy, they know what could happen.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The pro-Houthi Yemeni news channel Al-Masirah posted a message in Hebrew on Telegram on Monday warning that 'the promise is approaching.' The message referred to the deadline for humanitarian aid and included a graphic showing that only one day remained. Possible Hamas involvement Hamas may have requested the Houthis resume attacks as a way to pressure Israel into maintaining a cease-fire, according to Israeli assessments. Last month, senior Houthi officials issued a similar threat, warning that if cease-fires in Gaza or Lebanon collapsed, missile attacks from Yemen would resume. Since the start of the war, Hamas has sought to coordinate multiple fronts against Israel. Israel is preparing for the possibility that the Houthis will act on their latest threat, either by attempting to enforce a naval blockade or by resuming missile strikes. Israeli officials say there is close coordination with U.S. Central Command in anticipation of such developments. They expect a stronger U.S. response against the Houthis than in recent months. Former U.S. President Donald Trump designated the Houthis a terrorist organization and imposed sanctions on their leaders within his first month in office. Israel has carried out five airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen during the war. The last strike took place on Jan. 10, just days before the transition of power in Washington. Despite suffering losses to key assets, the Houthis have warned they are preparing for a new round of attacks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1vpx8psyl	2025-03-10T22:17:34-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/19/H111JJV00dA/H111JJV00dA_0_261_2508_1412_0_small.jpg

Iran's mission to the U.N. in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the planned meeting. Iran has denied wanting to develop a nuclear weapon. However, it is 'dramatically' accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% weapons-grade level, the IAEA has warned. Western states say there is no need to enrich uranium to such a high level under any civilian program and that no other country has done so without producing nuclear bombs. Iran says its nuclear program is peaceful. Iran reached a deal in 2015 with Britain, Germany, France, the U.S., Russia and China - known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action - that lifted sanctions on Tehran in return for restrictions on its nuclear program. Washington quit the agreement in 2018 during Donald Trump's first term as U.S. president, and Iran began moving away from its nuclear-related commitments. Britain, France and Germany have told the U.N. Security Council that they are ready - if needed - to trigger a so-called snap back of all international sanctions on Iran to prevent the country from acquiring a nuclear weapon.

Egypt’s $53 billion Gaza reconstruction plan may ‘face major obst...	Egypt’s plan to rebuild Gaza has been endorsed by the Arab League, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and several European states, but a lack of funding and opposition from the US and Israel might stop the plan in its tracks Despite the approval by officials from Arab nations of Egypt’s $53 billion plan to rebuild Gaza, the plan may 'face major obstacles before its implementation,' according to Abdullah Ghanem, a Saudi political analyst. He noted that the plan makes no mention of Hamas, the group that has controlled Gaza since 2007 and that was responsible for the October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel, alongside numerous other terror attacks. 'This will lead to the U.S. administration rejecting the plan, and Israel rejecting it as well,' Ghanem said. 'Perhaps the Islamic countries will support this plan, but it is also important for America, Europe, and Israel to support it,' he continued. The plan, which Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi presented at the emergency Arab League summit in Cairo last week, aims to provide an alternative to U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans to relocate Palestinians from Gaza and take U.S. control over the enclave. The Arab League statement released after the summit warned against 'any sinful attempts to displace the Palestinian people from their land,' saying that such attempts constitute a 'threat to peace in the Middle East.' The strategic choice of the Arab League remains the achievement of peace and stability through a two-state solution, the statement read. On Thursday evening, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said that the plan 'will include the removal of 50 million tons of rubble, the removal of unexploded ordnance, the provision of temporary housing units, the construction of a total of 460,000 permanent housing units and the restoration of basic services, networks and facilities' in Gaza. Representatives at last week’s summit included Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, Iraqi President Abdul Latif Rashid and interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres also spoke at the summit, calling attention to the immense suffering experienced by the Palestinians over the course of the war in Gaza. 'The situation may worsen if the international community does not assume its responsibility to end the war, alleviate the suffering, and ensure the achievement of lasting peace,' he said. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said in a statement following the summit that he would ask the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to adopt the plan. On Friday, that group voted to endorse the plan, according to media reports. On Saturday, the foreign ministers of France, Germany, Italy and the UK released a joint statement expressing their support for the proposal, describing it as a 'realistic path to the reconstruction of Gaza.' The U.S. has sent mixed signals about its support for the plan. U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff described the proposal as a 'good faith first step' with positive features on Thursday, but later that day, a spokesperson for the State Department called it ' inadequate.' Israel swiftly rejected the plan, with Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Oren Marmorstein posting on X that the proposal was stuck in an old paradigm intent on keeping Palestinian refugees. 'Now, with President Trump’s idea, there is an opportunity for the Gazans to have free choice based on their free will. This should be encouraged! Instead, Arab states have rejected this opportunity, without giving it a fair chance, and continue to level baseless accusations against Israel,' he wrote. A draft of the Egyptian plan includes the formation of a committee to manage affairs in the Gaza Strip during a six-month transitional phase. The committee would consist of independent Palestinian technocrats not associated with any of the political factions and would work under the umbrella of the Palestinian government. Egypt would also train Palestinian security cadres to ensure stability throughout the next phase, during which the Palestinian Authority would be put in control over Gaza. The plan extensively addresses rebuilding Gaza, which it estimates will cost $53 billion over five years. According to the Egyptian draft, the total material damage to the Gaza Strip since the war began amounts to $29.9 billion, along with economic and social losses amounting to $19.1 billion. The first stage of rebuilding, set to extend until 2027, would focus on reestablishing utilities, building and restoring permanent housing units, and reclaiming about 20,000 acres of agricultural land. The $30 billion second stage includes establishing industrial zones, a fishing port, a seaport, and an airport. According to the plan, temporary housing will be provided in seven locations throughout the strip for those displaced during the reconstruction process. The planned temporary housing is meant to accommodate more than 1.5 million residents. The summit’s final statement noted that a trust fund would be established to collect financial pledges toward the project. Mohamed El Azhar, an Egyptian political analyst, said that the plan has received 'great support from Arab and Islamic countries.' 'There are more than 50 countries that agree with it, and Egypt and the rest of the Arab countries will certainly seek to attract more support from countries around the world. We are very optimistic,' he said. He said that Egypt is singularly capable of managing Gaza’s reconstruction. 'It is the closest country to it, and all aid enters through it,' El Azhar said. 'Gaza has no borders other than with Israel and Egypt, so Egypt knows everything the strip needs, and it also knows how to manage things realistically.' Iraqi political analyst Abdul Redha Al-Saffar said that the Arab summit came too late, more than a month after Trump announced his plan for Gaza on February 4. 'There are moves by Israel to restart the war in Gaza, which means we are back to square one,' Al-Saffar said. 'So this plan is up in the air and will not succeed.' He said that Israel had successfully weakened many of its rivals, including Hezbollah and groups based in Gaza and Iraq, making the country less susceptible to pressure. Abdullah Ghanem, a Saudi political analyst, told The Media Line that the plan may 'face major obstacles before its implementation.'

'Perhaps the Islamic countries will support this plan, but it is also important for America, Europe and Israel to support it,' he continued. Abdul Latif Assaf, a Palestinian journalist living abroad, similarly described the U.S. and Israeli reluctance to support the plan as 'the biggest challenge' regarding its implementation. 'The other challenge is who will bear the cost,' he said. 'The Arab countries will not be able to provide $53 billion, the U.S. administration will not pay, and the countries of the world are all suffering from a weak economy, so who will bear the cost?' He said that Gazans themselves will get behind any proposal that allows them to return to normalcy and remain in Gaza. 'The people of Gaza just want to return to their homes and live in peace and quiet, away from Israeli or Hamas threats,' he said.

IDF chief cancels all holiday leaves for soldiers, citing October...	Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir changes the long-standing military protocol that grants large-scale leave during holidays — one of the lessons learned from October 7, saying the dramatic move aims to ensure there is no day in the year when a significant portion of the IDF is on standby IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir has canceled all routine holiday leaves for soldiers, saying the army must remain on alert year-round in the wake of the deadly October 7 attack by Hamas. Speaking to senior military commanders, Zamir said mandatory service members and career officers would still be entitled to vacations, but the longstanding practice of scheduled unit-wide leaves during holidays would be canceled. The decision follows military investigations into the failures of October 7, when Hamas exploited the reduced troop presence along the Gaza border during the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah to launch its unprecedented terror attack. The findings showed that Hamas was aware of the Israeli military’s predictable holiday schedules, with its leader, Yahya Sinwar, reportedly noting that, during holidays and on Fridays, 'they don’t leave many people.' As part of the response to these findings, Zamir ordered a surprise drill to test the military’s readiness for base infiltrations, and Israel’s military inspector launched an unannounced review of Northern Command operations. Preliminary reports highlighted failures in intelligence processing and warning systems, with some analysts suggesting that the absence of key officers during pre-scheduled holiday leaves may have impacted real-time information flow and coordination. While military analysts say the Oct. 7 failures were due to multiple factors — including intelligence shortcomings and Hamas' strategic planning — reducing troop presence on holidays has been identified as a vulnerability. Zamir’s order ensures that, going forward, key units, including intelligence, Air Force, and operations divisions, remain fully staffed year-round. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Military officials say holiday leave suspension is particularly significant for combat units and command centers that manage border security. The military has already increased its permanent force deployment along Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and the West Bank during holidays as a result of the war. During the October 7 terror attack, reduced troop presence left many bases undermanned, and the scale of Hamas’ assault overwhelmed the defenses. Intelligence gathered from Gaza after the war began included Hamas’ operational orders for attacking the Nahal Oz base, which detailed Israeli troop weaknesses, including the routine reduction of forces on weekends. A previous decision by Israel’s military high command to cut weekend troop presence in combat zones by half, intended to boost motivation for enlistment in combat roles, was recently reassessed. Military officials have since labeled it a 'mistake,' with Nahal Oz base — where 53 Israeli soldiers were killed —identified as one of the most vulnerable sites on Oct. 7 due to understaffing. Despite the cancellation of scheduled leaves, individual soldiers will still be granted time off, but Israel’s military will remain on full operational footing year-round to prevent future lapses in readiness. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1ccdq3skl	2025-03-10T11:09:42-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/rJ7hPDPikg/rJ7hPDPikg_0_0_2048_1152_0_small.jpg

Tanker hired by US military carrying jet fuel ablaze off UK after...	A tanker carrying jet fuel for the U.S. military was hit by a container ship off northeast England on Monday, with the collision igniting a blaze on both vessels, causing multiple explosions and forcing both crews to abandon ship. The tanker, which can carry tens of thousands of tons of jet fuel, was at anchor when the smaller container ship struck it, rupturing its cargo tank and releasing fuel into the sea, its operator said. Its owner Stena Bulk gave the same details. There is a risk of environmental damage, experts said. The tanker, the Stena Immaculate, operated by U.S. logistics group Crowley, was carrying Jet-A1 fuel when it was struck by the Portuguese-flagged cargo ship Solong while anchored near Hull, Crowley wrote on X. The tanker is part of a U.S. government program designed to supply the armed forces with fuel when required. A U.S. military spokesperson told Reuters on Monday it had been on a short-term charter to the U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk3pgh2jje	2025-03-10T10:43:07-07:00	
Trump boasts about ICE arrest of organizer of Columbia University...	The US president says it is 'the first arrest of many to come' after vowing to deport foreign students and imprison 'agitators' involved in protests against Israel's actions in Gaza U.S. President Donald Trump boasted about the arrest by federal immigration authorities of a prominent Palestinian activist who helped lead Columbia University’s student encampment movement. Trump posted a message on Monday on his Truth Social media platform about the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, and said that it is 'the first arrest of many to come.' 'Following my previously signed Executive Orders, ICE proudly apprehended and detained Mahmoud Khalil, a Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student on the campus of Columbia University,' Trump wrote in his post. 'This is the first arrest of many to come. We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it. Many are not students, they are paid agitators. We will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country — never to return again. If you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here. We expect every one of America’s Colleges and Universities to comply. Thank you!' Khalil was at his university-owned apartment blocks from Columbia’s Manhattan campus when several Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents entered the building and took him into custody on Saturday night, according to his attorney, Amy Greer. Trump has vowed to deport foreign students and imprison 'agitators' involved in protests against Israel's actions in Gaza since the Hamas massacre on October 7, 2023. The administration has placed particular scrutiny on Columbia, announcing Friday that it would be cutting $400 million in grants and contracts because of what the government describes as the Ivy League school’s failure to squelch antisemitism on campus. The New York Civil Liberties Union calls Khalil's detention unlawful, retaliatory and an attack on free speech rights. Khalil grew up in a Palestinian refugee camp in his native Syria and has worked for the British embassy in Beirut. He holds a U.S. permanent residency green card.

Israeli court rules in favor of parents who gave birth to baby in...	Family Court initially ruled to transfer the baby to her biological parents, but after an appeal by the birth mother and her partner they were granted custody: 'She gave birth to her and risked her life, parents should not be separated from their daughter'; 'We are shocked and heartbroken — our daughter will continue to grow up in a mistake' biological parents say An Israeli court on Monday ruled in favor of the couple who gave birth to a baby girl following an in-vitro fertilization (IVF) mix-up, determining that they will remain her legal parents despite a lack of genetic connection. The decision upheld the couple’s parental rights while recognizing the importance of maintaining a connection between the child and her biological parents. The ruling by the Central District Court overturned a lower court’s decision and concluded that the woman who carried and gave birth to the baby, named Sophia, should be recognized as her legal mother. The case arose from an IVF error at Assuta Medical Center in Rishon Lezion, where an embryo belonging to another couple was mistakenly implanted in the mother’s womb. The mistake was discovered through genetic testing after the child’s birth. The couple raising Sophia expressed relief and joy following the court’s decision. 'We are thrilled and emotional over the ruling that corrected the injustice done to us in the lower court,' they said in a statement. 'We pray this decision will give our daughter and us the peace we need to continue her development. We are focused solely on our child and want to raise her in security and quiet, as any parent would.' They also expressed hope that, with time, both sides would have space to process the ruling, potentially opening the door for some level of future communication. Attorney Galit Kerner, who represented the couple raising Sophia, welcomed the court’s decision. 'This is a sensitive and humane ruling that affirms a mother and father cannot and should not be separated from the child they carried and have lovingly raised,' she said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The biological parents of the child, however, reacted with dismay. 'We are shocked and heartbroken by this decision, which reverses the ruling of the Family Court,' they said in a statement. 'This ruling sends the painful message that even the most serious mistakes and injustices are not only left uncorrected but legitimized and perpetuated by the state. We are solely focused on Sophia’s well-being, her future, her identity and her life story. The idea that our daughter will grow up in the result of a mistake that could have been corrected early on is unbearable. Her whole life is ahead of her, and we firmly believe that her long-term best interest is to grow up with her biological family, to whom she belongs and resembles.' Attorneys Shmuel Moran and Noa Gelerman Liel, who represent the biological parents, criticized the ruling, calling it a dangerous precedent. 'This effectively amounts to a redistribution of children in society. It sends a perilous message, particularly in the realm of fertility treatments and birth,' they said. The court cited several factors in its ruling, emphasizing that the woman who gave birth to Sophia had carried the pregnancy without knowing of the error. The judges highlighted that she risked her own life to save the baby, undergoing an in utero surgery despite medical advice to terminate the pregnancy due to detected heart defects. The court noted that both she and her partner had devoted themselves to the child’s care and well-being since birth. Given the complexities of artificial reproduction and the potential for human error, the court stated that prioritizing the 'principle of certainty' is crucial — affirming that the birth mother should be recognized as the child’s legal parent. This principle, the ruling argued, prevents the need for retroactive genetic testing to determine legal parentage in future fertility errors. Instead, genetic testing should only serve to inform the child about their full life story, rather than dictate legal custody. The judges referenced Israeli law, including surrogacy regulations, egg donation laws, and civil registry statutes, as well as Jewish legal interpretations, to support their decision. 'Just as a fetus is not removed from the womb of a gestational mother, so too should a newborn not be taken from her hands. The nurturing womb and the embracing arms of the birth mother are one and the same,' the ruling stated. The court also determined that the woman’s partner should be recognized as Sophia’s legal father, based on his parental connection to the birth mother. The judges further ruled that it was in Sophia’s best interest to remain with the only parents she has ever known, citing her medical and developmental challenges and the potential irreversible harm that could result from severing that bond. At the same time, the court emphasized the importance of ensuring Sophia learns about her origins in an age-appropriate manner, as recommended by professional experts. The welfare authorities will oversee a structured plan to facilitate ongoing contact between the child and her biological parents while maintaining legal parental rights solely with the couple raising her. The case stems from an IVF embryo mix-up at Assuta Medical Center, which came to light in September 2022 when genetic testing revealed no biological connection between the couple and the fetus the woman was carrying. The revelation exposed significant procedural failures at the fertility clinic, ultimately leading to a legal battle over parental rights after Sophia’s birth and the subsequent identification of her biological parents. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkh900fnske	2025-03-10T08:41:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/10/26/SJlA9vCU4j/SJlA9vCU4j_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Man who scaled London's 'Big Ben' clock tower appears in court	A man who climbed part way up the 'Big Ben' clock tower at London's Palace of Westminster early on Saturday and stayed there all day as part of a pro-Palestinian protest, appeared in court on Monday. Daniel Day, 29, was charged by police with climbing and remaining on the tower which created 'a risk or caused serious harm to the public', and also trespassing on a protected site. Prosecutors said Day's actions had led to serious disruption in that area of central London with roads closed and buses diverted, and the cancellation of parliamentary tours had cost 25,000 pounds ($32,300). Day's lawyer said he would plead not guilty to the first charge, saying his action was designed to spread awareness regarding the situation in Gaza and Britain's response to it. The second charge of trespass requires the authorization of the attorney general, and so the case was adjourned until March 17 for a decision to be made. Day, from a seaside town in eastern England, was remanded in custody, with his supporters clapping and shouting 'Hero' and 'Free Palestine' as he was led away.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjytz5nijl	2025-03-10T08:23:36-07:00	
Israeli negotiators head to Doha and will be joined by Witkoff, w...	Israeli delegation will arrive in Doha, where it will discuss with the mediators the framework proposed by Trump's envoy- who claims that an approach needs to be changed in order to release the hostages; Hamas has been adamant in its refusal and is making it clear now that it is interested in moving to Phase II, which includes ending the war: 'threats of war will not work' A delegation of Israeli negotiators departed for Doha on Monday afternoon and is expected to begin indirect talks with Hamas later in the day through mediators, based on a framework proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s special Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff. The initial discussions will focus on the structure of the negotiations and the issues to be addressed. Witkoff himself is expected to join the talks on Tuesday or Wednesday. In an interview with Fox News earlier in the day, Witkoff said, 'We need deadlines' for the next stage of the cease-fire deal, reiterating his claim that this is the only way to advance the stalled negotiations. Last week he stressed that 'Trump has had enough.' According to Witkoff, 'This has to happen. The way these hostages are being held is unacceptable.' Witkoff emphasized the urgency of securing the hostages’ release, describing the condition of those already freed as 'simply unacceptable' and 'deplorable.' He added: 'Many of them came out sick, they hadn’t eaten, they didn’t receive medical care. It’s a terrible situation for them. It’s just unacceptable.' Meanwhile, Hamas continued to reject Witkoff’s proposal, reiterating Monday afternoon its demand to move to the second phase of negotiations, which includes a permanent cease-fire. 'We reaffirm our full commitment to the cease-fire agreement and its implementation, and we are ready to immediately begin negotiations for the second phase,' the terror group said. Hamas accused Israel of 'undermining the agreement and refusing to proceed to the second phase, exposing its intention to evade and delay. Netanyahu is obstructing the agreement’s implementation for personal and political reasons, and the last thing he cares about is releasing the Zionist prisoners or the feelings of their families.' In another statement, Hamas said: 'The agreement was brokered by the mediators and witnessed by the world. Its implementation is mandatory as it is the only way to return the enemy’s prisoners. We reject attempts to pressure Hamas, while the occupation evades its commitments without accountability. The language of extortion and threats of war will not work. There is no way forward except negotiations and adherence to the agreement. Anything else jeopardizes the fate of the prisoners. The occupation’s continued stalling and deception will not provide it cover, but rather increase its isolation and expose the falsehood of its narrative to the world.' Hamas stated earlier Monday that it has shown flexibility in talks with the United States, Qatar and Egypt regarding the hostage deal and cease-fire with Israel. It said it is now waiting to see whether negotiations with Israel will yield results and allow the second phase of the agreement to proceed. 'The talks focused on ending the war, Israel’s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and its reconstruction,' Hamas said. 'We fulfilled our commitments in the first phase. Our priority now is to provide aid to our people and ensure a permanent cease-fire,' Hamas spokesperson Abd al-Latif al-Qanou said. He added that Hamas agreed to Egypt’s proposal to establish a committee to govern Gaza, but claimed Israel’s goal is to tighten the blockade, close the crossings, prevent relief for Palestinians, and push them to emigrate. 'Israel’s talk of military plans to resume fighting, along with cutting off electricity, threatens the hostages, who will only be freed through negotiations,' he said. A Palestinian official told Sky News Arabia on Monday that Egypt insisted on discussing the disarmament of Hamas as a condition for establishing the proposed governing committee in Gaza. This, the official said, is intended to prevent Israeli objections that could hinder reconstruction efforts. Ahead of the Israeli delegation’s departure for Qatar, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to give the team 'full authority to bring home all 59 hostages at once.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Earlier Monday, diplomatic sources told the Qatari news outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that the future of Hamas’ weapons in Gaza was a key issue in talks between Trump’s envoy, Adam Boehler, and the terror group. According to the report, Hamas’ proposed 'package,' supported by other armed factions in Gaza, also covers the West Bank and Jerusalem. It includes a cease-fire lasting at least 10 years. 'The situation in Jerusalem, according to the proposal, would remain unchanged,' the report said, referring to the status quo. The Qatari report stated that Hamas expressed a willingness to discuss its offensive weapons and rockets in exchange for the long-term truce, which would include an Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza, the end of the war and the release of all Israeli hostages, beginning with those holding American citizenship. Hamas reportedly offered to release American hostage Edan Alexander as a 'gesture of goodwill' to keep negotiations open with Washington. However, the group emphasized it would not relinquish its weapons in the event a Palestinian state is established. Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt’s State Information Service, told Al-Raed TV Monday night that the talks between the United States and Egypt indicate that 'there is no winner in the war.' According to Rashwan, 'Netanyahu will not resume the war without Trump. The meetings between Washington and Hamas reveal secrets about Gaza’s future after the war — because their communication means that the day after belongs to Hamas.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syalu003ojx	2025-03-10T07:27:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/09/rk11B4tooyl/rk11B4tooyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

West Bank security on edge amid fragile Gaza cease-fire, released...	Security officials warn that approximately 80% of recently released Palestinian prisoners may return to terrorism, with some rebuilding networks; Meanwhile, declining economic conditions and rise in illegal crossings into Israel add further instability After months of conflict and heightened tensions, the West Bank is entering a critical period. While the frequency of terrorist attacks has decreased, the coming weeks are expected to bring a series of developments that could inflame the already fragile security situation. The recent release of Palestinian prisoners, ongoing Israeli military operations, growing economic distress, and the volatile atmosphere surrounding Ramadan all contribute to a complex and unpredictable reality. Israeli security officials are closely monitoring these converging factors, which could lead to further escalation both in the West Bank and inside Israel. While the IDF and Shin Bet are working to prevent a deterioration, a combination of internal and external pressures may test their ability to maintain stability. Ramadan tensions and the threat of escalation With Ramadan already underway, Israeli security officials are bracing for the possibility of violence centered around Al-Aqsa Mosque, a frequent flashpoint during the holy month. Religious tensions have historically been exploited by terrorist groups to incite violence, and this year is no exception. Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar named the October 7 attack 'Al-Aqsa Flood,' framing it as a response to Israeli actions at the site. The Israeli security cabinet has yet to decide whether to approve a defense establishment recommendation to allow 10,000 Muslim worshippers onto the Temple Mount, as was permitted last year. Any restrictions, confrontations, or incidents at the site could further inflame tensions, particularly against the backdrop of ongoing IDF operations in the West Bank. The return of freed terrorists to the West Bank One of the most immediate security concerns is the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners into the West Bank as part of the hostage deal with Hamas. While Israeli officials have acknowledged the necessity of these releases, they have also warned of the consequences. A senior security official recently estimated that about 80% of those freed are expected to return to terrorism in some form. This is not merely a question of individuals carrying out attacks. Many of the released prisoners are experienced operatives with the knowledge and networks to reestablish terrorist cells, secure funding and weapons, and recruit new militants. Compounding the risk, security officials have noted a significant increase in the flow of weapons and funds into the West Bank, making it easier for these individuals to reengage in terror activity. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israeli security forces, in close coordination with the Palestinian Authority, are monitoring these former prisoners. However, Hamas and other groups continue to receive external support, making it difficult to contain the growing threat. The Palestinian Authority itself has an interest in preventing Hamas from strengthening its presence in the West Bank, but its ability to act remains limited. Economic instability fueling unrest The Palestinian Authority is facing severe financial difficulties, adding another layer of instability. At the same time, terrorist organizations are injecting funds into the West Bank, using financial incentives to recruit new operatives. Ramadan typically brings an economic boost, as many Israeli Arabs visit Palestinian cities to shop and dine. However, security officials report a decline in both visitors and spending, indicating growing financial distress. The worsening economy is a concern not just for the Palestinian leadership but also for Israeli security officials, who fear that economic frustration could further destabilize the situation. The issue of Palestinian laborers in Israel also remains unresolved. The security cabinet has yet to formulate a clear policy on work permits, and in the meantime, the number of Palestinians entering Israel illegally is on the rise. Israeli security forces are struggling to monitor and regulate these movements, raising concerns that terrorist groups could exploit the situation to smuggle operatives into Israeli cities. IDF operations shifting the battlefield The IDF continues to conduct military operations across the West Bank, particularly in the northern region, where armed groups have gained strength in recent years. While these operations have led to the arrest or killing of key terrorist figures, they have also had unintended consequences. Many operatives are now relocating to other areas, potentially spreading the threat rather than eliminating it. Security officials believe that maintaining a strong military presence in the West Bank is essential for reducing attacks and enabling rapid responses to intelligence threats. However, the extended nature of IDF operations inside refugee camps has driven some terrorist operatives to reposition themselves, with the potential to launch attacks from different locations. Terrorist organizations see this period as an opportunity to provoke wider unrest, particularly by encouraging lone-wolf attacks inside Israeli cities. Leaders of these groups are hoping that a series of high-profile incidents will trigger broader protests and inspire additional attackers. Terror groups targeting upcoming Jewish holidays Beyond the immediate security concerns, Israeli officials are also looking ahead to key dates on the Israeli calendar that have historically been targeted by terrorist organizations. Jewish holidays and national commemorations, including Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Passover, are often seen as strategic moments to carry out attacks. Adding to the uncertainty is the possibility of a U.S. policy announcement regarding Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank, as well as the potential for renewed fighting in Gaza or even along the Lebanese border. With so many volatile factors converging, Israeli security forces face one of their toughest tests in recent months. The coming weeks will likely determine whether the relative calm in the West Bank holds or if a new wave of violence emerges. The IDF and Shin Bet remain on high alert, knowing that even a single incident could set off a wider escalation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjhenwno1e	2025-03-10T05:51:36-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/SylgPo391l/SylgPo391l_1_103_1601_901_0_small.jpg

Trump administration warns Iraq: Free Israeli researcher or 'face...	Officials say US envoy conveyed direct messages to Iraqi PM, making it clear Baghdad bears full responsibility for securing Elizabeth Tsurkov’s release The Trump administration has issued a formal warning to Iraq, demanding the swift release of Israeli researcher Elizabeth Tsurkov or face political and economic consequences, two senior Iraqi officials told the Qatari news outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed on Monday. According to the officials, Adam Boehler, the Trump administration’s envoy for hostage affairs, recently conveyed direct messages to Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, making it clear that Baghdad bears full responsibility for securing Tsurkov’s release. One of the officials stated that Boehler 'threatened a package of punitive U.S. measures against Iraq if Tsurkov is not freed soon.' Tsurkov, an Israeli academic and journalist, was abducted in Iraq seven months ago by the Iran-backed Shiite militia Kataib Hezbollah, which has refused to engage in negotiations. Iraqi officials say the government, with support from Shiite political leaders, has renewed efforts to resolve the crisis, aiming to avoid U.S. sanctions. A second Iraqi official confirmed that authorities are focusing their efforts on mediating with Kataib Hezbollah and other armed groups. 'The government has been working on this issue for months, but the captors have not responded at all — and ransom is not their objective,' the official said. 'This makes resolving the situation significantly more difficult.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Boehler spoke publicly about Tsurkov’s case in recent interviews with Saudi-owned Al Arabiya and Fox News, revealing that he had personally discussed the matter with the Iraqi prime minister. Al-Sudani reportedly acknowledged that Tsurkov may be held by Kataib Hezbollah. Boehler also recently visited Baghdad, where he was seen near the site of the 2020 U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani. Amid growing U.S. pressure, Iraq’s National Security Advisor Qasim al-Araji stated last week that authorities were working to locate Tsurkov, who was kidnapped in March 2023. The only known footage of her captivity surfaced in November of that year. 'We must work discreetly, through intermediaries,' al-Araji said, while Iraqi officials expressed concerns that Washington could impose sanctions regardless of the case’s outcome. On Saturday, two U.S. diplomats told the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat that the Biden administration is preparing phased, wide-ranging sanctions against Iraqi government and political figures, as well as militia groups. Iraq, governed by the pro-Iranian Coordination Framework coalition, remains divided over its stance on U.S. policy toward Tehran. The reported sanctions are part of Washington’s broader strategy to 'apply maximum pressure on Iran and counter its influence' in Iraq.

The government has scheduled a no-confidence vote against Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara for Sunday, March 23, sources said Monday. The decision follows a request last week from Justice Minister Yariv Levin to Cabinet Secretariat Yossi Fuchs to initiate proceedings for Baharav-Miara’s dismissal. In his letter, Levin argued that 'the government must express no-confidence in the Attorney General due to her inappropriate conduct and the existence of significant and prolonged disagreements between her and the government — creating a deadlock that prevents effective cooperation.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyo1100bhi1g	2025-03-10T03:09:35-07:00

Syrian defense ministry says operation against Assad loyalists is...	New regime's crackdown in the province of Latakia - former president's coastal heartland - has killed more than 1,000 people, mostly civilians A Syrian military operation against loyalists of ousted former President Bashar al-Assad has been completed, the defence ministry said on Monday. Clashes between Assad loyalists and the country's new Islamist rulers in the former president's coastal heartland have killed more than 1,000 people, mostly civilians, according to a war monitoring group. Hassan Abdul Ghany, the defence ministry spokesperson, said in a statement on X that public institutions were now able to resume their work and provide essential services. 'We are paving the way for life to return to normal and for the consolidation of security and stability,' Abdul Ghany said. He added that plans were in place to continue combating the remnants of the former government and eliminate any future threats. Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa vowed on Sunday to hunt down the perpetrators of the violent clashes and said he would hold to account anyone who overstepped the new rulers' authority. Al-Sharaa's office also said it was forming an independent committee to investigate the clashes and killings carried out by both sides. Abdul Ghany added that the security forces would cooperate with the investigation committee, offering full access to uncover the circumstances of the events, verify the facts and ensure justice for the wronged. 'We were able to absorb the attacks from the remnants of the former regime and its officers. We shattered their element of surprise and managed to push them away from vital centers, securing most of the main roads,' he said.

The fighting spiralled into revenge killings against Alawites, an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam that is the faith of some of Assad's most ardent supporters and became associated with Assad's wartime atrocities against Syria's mostly Sunni Muslim population. The British-based Syrian Observatory reported that more than 1,000 people were killed during two days of fighting, including 745 civilians, 125 members of the Syrian security forces and 148 fighters loyal to Assad. Assad fled to Russia last year after rebels led by Sharaa's Sunni Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group toppled his government, ending decades of severe repression and a devastating civil war. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjezkrnjye	2025-03-10T02:38:13-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/09/HJ2TQ69oyg/HJ2TQ69oyg_1_197_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
UN recognition of hostage families as torture victims 'milestone ...	Speaking with Ynetnews, Advocate Hila Kugler-Ramot says decision could bolster legal and diplomatic pressure on terror group; 'We'll continue working to ensure justice is served' In an interview with Ynet, Advocate Hila Kugler-Ramot, CEO of the International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists, discussed the significance of a newly published UN report on hostage-taking, which recognizes both Israeli hostages held by Hamas and their families as victims of torture. Speaking about the report’s findings, Kugler-Ramot emphasized its groundbreaking approach. 'Dr. Alice Jill Edwards, the UN’s special rapporteur on torture, addressed hostage-taking comprehensively, covering both state and non-state actors. Her report made two major contributions: first, recognizing hostages as victims of torture, and second—and perhaps even more significantly—acknowledging that their families also endure torture due to the psychological abuse inflicted by Hamas.' The findings were presented at a special event at the UN in Geneva on March 5, led by the International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists, in partnership with the Hostages and Missing Families Forum and with support from the German embassy in Geneva. The voice of the families Among those attending the UN discussion were Lishai Miran-Levi, the wife of hostage Omri Miran, and Rivka Bukhbut, the wife of hostage Elkana Bukhbut. Kugler-Ramot stressed the significance of their testimonies. 'Their presence was essential,' she said. 'They gave the world an unfiltered look at the horrifying reality their husbands are experiencing in captivity. But beyond that, they shed light on their own suffering and the toll this has taken on their children.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Dr. Edwards, the special rapporteur, visited Israel and met with the families of hostages. According to Kugler-Ramot, this direct engagement had a profound impact on shaping the report’s conclusions. When asked about the practical impact of the UN’s findings, Kugler-Ramot highlighted how the report could serve as a powerful tool for legal action and advocacy. 'With Dr. Edwards’ status as a leading global expert, this report can help push for accountability and justice,' she explained. 'It also makes an important clarification—that soldiers taken captive are also considered victims of hostage-taking, reinforcing international legal protections.' Challenges and next steps Despite the report’s significance, Kugler-Ramot acknowledged that challenges remain in implementing its recommendations. 'This is a milestone in international law, but it’s only the first step,' she noted. 'Now, we need UN member states to adopt these conclusions and act on them. That will be the real test.' As efforts continue to secure the release of the hostages, Kugler-Ramot remains hopeful that this recognition will strengthen legal and diplomatic pressure on Hamas. 'This is just the beginning,' she concluded. 'We will continue working to ensure that justice is served.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skjz0z2sjg	2025-03-10T02:27:38-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/08/Syv007E5o1e/Syv007E5o1e_0_198_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

‘Living in fear’: Alawite civilians tell of massacres by Syrian s...	Fighting between pro-Assad rebels and security forces escalates in Syria’s Latakia province, raising fears of further sectarian conflict and regional destabilization Syria, a nation exhausted by more than a decade of civil war, has once again plunged into chaos as violent clashes erupted between armed rebels and government security forces in the coastal province of Latakia. The latest violence highlights the deep divisions in Syrian society following the ousting of President Bashar Assad in December 2024—a turning point that many hoped would lead to peace but has instead reignited old rivalries. According to an official security source speaking anonymously, pro-Assad fighters launched a series of coordinated attacks on security checkpoints and outposts in the region, resulting in the deaths of 121 security personnel and the injury of dozens more. The violence quickly escalated beyond military targets, with reports of horrific massacres against Alawite civilians—the religious minority to which Assad belonged—allegedly carried out by forces linked to the new government. The recent surge in violence reflects the power vacuum left in the wake of Assad’s downfall. Remnants of Assad’s loyalist forces are refusing to surrender while the new government struggles to consolidate control. Localized skirmishes have quickly spiraled into a full-scale conflict, with both sides accusing the other of war crimes. Clashes erupted in the city of Jableh and its surrounding rural areas, where intense firefights broke out between security forces and pro-Assad fighters. Latakia, a predominantly Alawite stronghold, had been a pillar of regime support throughout Syria’s brutal civil war, making it a symbolic and strategic target for both sides. The Syrian Ministry of Defense deployed military reinforcements to the region, sending convoys of heavy artillery and armored vehicles to support security forces. The government framed the operation as a necessary step to crush the insurgency and protect civilians, but eyewitness reports painted a far darker picture. As government forces pushed back against the rebels, local sources reported that at least 150 Alawite civilians—including women and children—were executed by members of the security forces. The killings took place in villages across Latakia and Tartous, triggering widespread condemnation and calls for accountability. A leaked video showed a soldier, allegedly from the Ministry of Defense, executing an elderly man in one of the coastal villages. The footage, which spread rapidly online, intensified public outrage and drew comparisons to the brutal tactics used by Assad’s regime in the early years of the war. Since the collapse of Assad’s rule, a large number of military and security personnel have gone into hiding in the Latakia mountains. Many of these individuals are high-ranking figures accused of committing war crimes on behalf of Assad, and they are believed to be behind the recent violent uprisings in the coastal region. Rabee, an Alawite resident of Latakia, confirmed that extrajudicial killings had taken place in his village, targeting his relatives. He described the situation as 'deeply distressing.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'My relatives and friends are living in fear,' Rabee said. 'Many innocent people in my village have been killed without any reason—they were civilians, and they were murdered by Syrian security forces.' Alaa Al-Khair, a resident of Qardaha—Bashar Assad’s hometown—emphasized the importance of distinguishing between Assad loyalists and members of the Alawite religion. 'Not everyone in the coastal region supports Assad,' Al-Khair said. 'Hundreds of thousands of Alawite civilians themselves do not support him.' He said that while the situation in Qardaha itself was relatively stable, surrounding villages had witnessed executions of civilians, which could further inflame tensions between the government and the coastal population. 'The unraveling of Syrian society' The brutality has sent shockwaves throughout Syria, raising fears of renewed sectarian conflict and further destabilization of an already fragile region. A government security official attempted to downplay the atrocities, claiming they were 'isolated incidents' carried out by 'unorganized crowds' seeking revenge for the assassination of security personnel. However, human rights groups and local activists rejected this explanation, warning that unchecked retaliation could ignite sectarian violence on a massive scale. Amira Haddad, a political analyst based in Damascus, said: 'What we are witnessing is not just a military conflict, but the unraveling of Syrian society. The massacres are a grim reminder that the wounds of the civil war have not healed, and without accountability, history will repeat itself.' Determined to reassert control, the Syrian Ministry of Defense announced the launch of coordinated military operations to reclaim rebel-held areas. Special forces units and night combat brigades were deployed to conduct precision strikes on militant strongholds, while warplanes carried out airstrikes in rural Jableh. Ministry of Defense spokesperson Col. Hassan Abdel Ghani issued a stark warning on the X social media platform to the Assad loyalist fighters. 'To the remaining fighters: Don’t be fuel for a lost cause,' he wrote. 'Bashar Assad fled and abandoned you to your fate. Don’t repeat the mistake—or it will be your last.' Despite these threats, fighting continued to rage across the region, with neither side willing to back down. Civilian casualties mounted, and humanitarian organizations reported a sharp increase in displacement figures, as families fled their homes in search of safety. As the violence escalated, public demonstrations erupted across Syria. In cities like Damascus, Idlib, Homs, and Daraa, thousands took to the streets—some rallying in support of the military’s campaign, others demanding an end to the bloodshed and calling for justice for the victims of the massacres. In Latakia’s Saliba neighborhood, mourners carried Syrian flags and photographs of the slain civilians, chanting for unity and an end to sectarian killings. Protesters called on the international community to intervene and investigate the civilian massacres, fearing the country’s descent back into full-scale war. The resurgence of violence sent ripples across the Middle East, raising concerns that the conflict could once again draw in regional powers like Iran, Russia, and Turkey. Analysts warn that Iran-backed militias might attempt to rearm pro-Assad fighters, while opposition factions could seek support from neighboring countries, turning Syria into a proxy battleground for external actors. While the coastal Latakia region remains at the center of the current conflict, other areas of Syria—inhabited by different sectarian groups—remain tense but relatively calm. However, fears persist that the violence could spread to the Kurdish regions in the east or the Druze areas in the south. For now, the coastal front remains the epicenter of Syria’s struggle for a post-Assad future. As military operations continue and the humanitarian crisis deepens, Syria stands at a dangerous crossroads. The country’s future remains uncertain—caught between the hope for peace and the looming threat of greater chaos. > The story is written by Rizik Alabi and reprinted with permission from The Media Line.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkqyy73s1l	2025-03-10T01:20:38-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/09/Sk3lbyoo1e/Sk3lbyoo1e_0_62_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Hamas: 'We offered to release 10 hostages, Netanyahu refused'	Palestinian sources say Egypt insisting on terror group’s disarmament as condition to reconstruction efforts in the enclave in an effort to address Israeli concerns Hamas has proposed releasing 10 hostages in exchange for a two-month ceasefire, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the offer, according to a Palestinian source who spoke to Sky News Arabia. The source also said Egypt has insisted on discussing Hamas’s disarmament as a condition for allowing the Gaza Administration Committee to begin its work, in an effort to address Israeli concerns and facilitate reconstruction in the enclave. Hamas has reportedly informed Egyptian leadership that it would not oppose the committee’s operations in Gaza and would ensure its security. However, the group has not offered to disarm or withdraw from political activity in exchange for a long-term ceasefire. The source also said Hamas has proposed the release of American hostage Edan Alexander as a goodwill gesture to keep diplomatic channels open with Washington, without an official handover ceremony. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Meanwhile, Hamas spokesperson Abd al-Latif al-Qanou said the group is awaiting the outcome of negotiations in Qatar, claiming: 'We have shown flexibility in response to the efforts of the mediators and Trump’s envoy.' As negotiations continue, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged Netanyahu to grant full authority to the Israeli delegation expected to depart for Qatar on Monday. The group called for a mandate to secure the immediate return of all 59 remaining hostages in a single agreement. 'A comprehensive deal to bring back all the hostages is possible, and it is the Israeli government’s duty to its citizens who remain in Hamas tunnels,' the group said in a statement. It cited comments by Trump envoy Adam Boehler, who claimed, 'Hamas has proposed a broad hostage deal and a ceasefire lasting five to ten years, under which it would disarm.' The group warned that time is running out for the hostages. 'Testimonies from those who have returned leave no doubt—hostages are out of time,' the statement read. 'In the last exchange, hostages who were still alive could have been saved but were returned as corpses. Delays in negotiations will cost more lives and the chance to recover bodies for burial, denying families closure.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkomixhokg	2025-03-10T01:19:45-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/08/rkewOmE9oyg/rkewOmE9oyg_0_140_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
After two years of deadlock, Lebanon turns to Hezbollah’s disarma...	Lebanon faces the delicate challenge of disarming a weakened Hezbollah, risking instability amid fears of renewed civil conflict after devastating losses in the recent conflict with Israel After electing a president and forming a government following two years of political deadlock, Lebanon’s political class faces its biggest challenge yet: disarming Hezbollah. The Shiite terror militia has been severely decimated during the 14-month conflict with Israel. The brutality of last fall’s bombings wiped out much of the group’s political and military leadership, killing its leader of the past 32 years, Hassan Nasrallah, and his intended successor in the same week. However, the political party continues to mobilize much of the Shiite community and is a prominent political force that refuses to give up the hegemony that its weapons give it. 'Hezbollah has lost the war, and the so-called ceasefire agreement imposed on Lebanon was really a surrender agreement, which we see every day,' said Abdallah Khoury, a Lebanese political expert. Since the truce came into effect at the end of November, Israeli forces have continued to attack Lebanon with hardly a rebuke from the U.S.-chaired ceasefire monitoring committee. 'In every sense, it is a defeat for Hezbollah and, of course, it is also a defeat in terms of Lebanese sovereignty,' he said. Despite this tragic reality, not everyone sees it the same way. 'The different political camps in Lebanon try to explain the war in the way that best suits their political position: it is not surprising that Hezbollah has pointed to achievements that show its victory in its war against Israel, and it is also not surprising that its opponents point to its defeats to show that Hezbollah has lost the war,' Noah Johnson, senior analyst for Lebanon said. More than three months after the last war, Israeli forces are still present at five strategic points on the border between the two countries, in clear violation of the cease-fire. The Lebanese militia, the only one that did not lay down its arms at the end of the civil war (1975-1990), is closer than ever to doing so. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Anything is possible,' Johnson said. 'It was certainly difficult to even imagine having a conversation about the disarmament of Hezbollah even six months ago, which shows how significant these changes have been throughout the war,' he added. The militia is in a weakened position after Israel destroyed much of its military arsenal, killed thousands of fighters, and seriously wounded many others. That is why many in Lebanon, especially its detractors, believe that it is now time to seize the momentum and start disarmament. However, they have little time to achieve this because the country will hold elections again in 14 months. A political source close to Najib Mikati, the outgoing prime minister who took a moderate stance toward Hezbollah, said that 'none of the political parties will accept the return of the group’s military capacity [after the war].' However, the delicate sectarian balance underpinning Lebanon’s fragile political system demands caution. 'While Hezbollah should eventually disarm, it should do so gradually because otherwise there could be a high risk of a violent response from it or a state-led political paralysis in which Hezbollah and its allies find ways to block political activity,' Johnson warned. 'If the government does not move quickly to disarm, this momentum could slip away, regional balances could shift [the fall of Bashar Assad, its main ally in Syria, has severely affected the group] and Hezbollah could become stronger on the domestic scene,' he added. One way the militia could hand over its weapons is through the weak and underfunded Lebanese army. National troops are supposed to take up positions in the south of the country, where Hezbollah reigned supreme until just a few months ago. However, among the soldiers are many Shiite citizens, the community that Hezbollah represents. The possibility of a direct confrontation with the group would motivate many of them to defect, paving the way for civil conflict. For Khoury, that scenario is not very probable. 'I don’t see it very likely that we will get involved in military action by the army against Hezbollah,' he said. 'We will try to move forward in a consensual way towards a solution; Lebanon is not going to get involved in a civil war just because the international community, the Americans or the Israelis want to see Hezbollah weakened,' he added, calling for 'patience.' 'The international community should avoid getting involved or interfering in the way the Lebanese should deal with the disarmament of Hezbollah and its political role,' Johnson agreed. 'These are issues that affect the daily lives of the Lebanese; therefore, only the Lebanese should decide the future of Lebanon.' > The story is written by Taylor Thomas and reprinted with permission from The Media Line.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjky17noyx	2025-03-10T01:09:42-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/07/rJGq007smY1g/rJGq007smY1g_668_518_1665_937_0_small.jpg

Israeli tourist to return home after brutal gang rape in India	Indian authorities arrest third suspects and pledge enhanced safety measures for tourists four days after a horrific gang rape near Sanapur Lake; Israeli victim to leave the country Monday Four days after the rape of a 27-year-old Israeli woman and a guesthouse owner in Karnataka, India, the victim is expected to board a flight to Israel on Monday. Meanwhile, Indian police named the third suspect in the gang rape and murder case as Kasiram. The suspect was arrested after fleeing to Tamil Nadu. Two other suspects, Mallesh and Chetan Sai Sillekyatar, were arrested the previous day and their photos were published by the local police. The Karnataka’s interior minister vowed to significantly increase security measures at the tourist destination following the attack. He also said that tourists arriving in the state would receive safety briefings to ensure their well-being. The brutal incident took place last Thursday when the Israeli woman and the guesthouse owner were traveling with two Americans and an Indian tourist near the village of Sanapur in Karnataka. According to the guesthouse owner’s testimony, as they were stargazing and playing the guitar, three suspects approached and demanded money. When they refused, the attackers assaulted the three men accompanying the women and threw them into a canal. One of the men drowned. According to the police complaint filed after the rape and murder, the assailants threatened to crush the men's heads with stones before throwing them into the canal and then raped the two women. In the water, American tourist Daniel Pittas managed to grab the hand of Pankaj Amrit Rao Patil and swam with him to the canal’s edge despite the strong current. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The third man, identified as a traveler named Bibash, was swept downstream. The survivors only saw his broken watch floating on the water. They returned to the spot where they had been attacked and found the two women. 'They were devastated, crying, with terror on their faces,' one of the survivors recalled. The group then made their way back to the guesthouse and later filed a complaint with the police. The guesthouse owner, who also reported the attack to police, described the events leading up to the assault. 'After dinner, we decided to go stargazing. We rode our scooters to the banks of the Tungabhadra Canal, near Sanapur Lake. As we were watching the stars and playing the guitar, around 10:30 p.m., three men on a motorcycle approached us and asked for fuel,' she said. She told them that there was no gas station nearby and suggested they find fuel in Sanapur. According to her testimony, one of the men suddenly demanded 100 rupees. 'They didn’t know us, so I told them I had no money. But they kept demanding, until one of the male tourists gave them 20 rupees.' When the travelers refused to give them more money, the suspects began arguing and threatening them with stones. Two of them then attacked and raped the women, while the third pushed the men into the canal and assaulted the guesthouse owner with stones. 'I was bleeding heavily. Two of the suspects dragged me to the side of the canal. One of them choked me and removed my clothes. One after the other, they beat me and raped me,' she said. The attackers stole her bag and fled with two mobile phones and 9,500 rupees. One of the men dragged the Israeli tourist away and raped her as well. 'When we screamed and cried, they fled on their motorcycle,' she recounted. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkrlbghije	2025-03-09T23:58:47-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/08/Bk00XNhKsJl/Bk00XNhKsJl_1_0_1200_675_0_small.jpg

Beyond the Product: How Strategic Branding Transforms Startups	How does branding shape the future of tech companies—and why is it vital for startups? From Google to TikTok, strategic name and identity shifts have driven global success. At SHOW 2025, experts will reveal how companies can stand out in a competitive market and what makes a brand memorable, trustworthy, and industry-leading In the competitive world of technology startups, branding has become just as important as the product itself. Ahead of SHOW 2025.THE BRAND TECH SUMMIT, set to take place in Israel on May 8, industry experts are emphasizing the role of strategic branding—sometimes beginning with a well-timed name change—in shaping a company’s trajectory. The Power of a Name: How Rebranding Shapes Companies The history of the tech industry includes numerous examples of companies that have reshaped their trajectory through carefully planned rebranding. One of the most well-known cases is Google, which started in 1996 as 'BackRub', a name reflecting its ability to analyze backlinks. Two years later, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin rebranded it as 'Google', a play on the mathematical term 'googol' (10¹⁰⁰), creating a simpler and more memorable identity that became synonymous with internet searching worldwide. Similarly, the project management platform Monday.com was originally launched as 'dapulse' in 2012. By 2017, the founders recognized that the original name caused confusion and limited the company’s growth potential. The decision to rebrand as Monday.com provided a clearer representation of its purpose while naturally linking the product to the beginning of the workweek—a key moment when people organize their priorities. Before becoming a global social media phenomenon, TikTok was known as 'Musical.ly' in markets outside China. When ByteDance acquired Musical.ly in 2018, they merged it with their existing app Douyin and introduced the rebranded version internationally as TikTok. The new name, which is catchy and onomatopoeic, contributed to the app’s rapid rise by making it instantly recognizable and reinforcing its focus on short, time-based content. More recent examples illustrate that rebranding continues to be a significant tool for companies adapting to evolving markets. One of the most high-profile corporate rebrands in recent years was Facebook’s transition to Meta in 2021. This move allowed the company to differentiate its parent entity from its flagship platform while signaling a strategic shift toward building the metaverse. That same year, financial services company Square rebranded as Block, reflecting a shift toward blockchain technology and a broader financial strategy beyond payment processing. The rebrand marked an expansion into various ventures, including Cash App, the music streaming service Tidal, and cryptocurrency-related initiatives. Other companies have also undergone rebrands to clarify their market positioning. In 2022, Indian quick-commerce startup Dunzo adopted the name Dunzo Daily to highlight its focus on everyday essentials and grocery deliveries. Similarly, project management software Clubhouse rebranded as Shortcut in 2021 to distinguish itself from the social audio platform that had gained widespread recognition. SHOW 2025: Exploring the Role of Branding in Tech The SHOW 2025 Brand Tech Summit, set to take place on May 8, 2025, at Cinema City, Israel, will bring together experts in technology branding and marketing. The one-day event will examine the relationship between branding and technological innovation, featuring discussions on how strategic brand positioning influences business growth. In today’s highly competitive market, branding plays a crucial role in determining whether a startup scales into a major player or struggles to gain traction,' said Yariv Amit, the event organizer. 'With thousands of companies offering innovative products, differentiation is essential.' The summit will host a diverse lineup of speakers, including Udi Ledergor, a seasoned B2B marketing leader and former CMO at Gong. Now serving as Chief Evangelist at Gong, Ledergor will deliver the keynote address and present his latest book, 'Courageous Marketing: The B2B Marketer's Playbook for Career Success.' The summit will feature insights from industry experts, including Gary Survis, Operating Partner at Insight Partners, who will discuss 'Branding in the Age of AI,' and Regev Gur, Founder and CEO of Narrative Group, who will examine 'Why Every Tech Company Should Work with Influencers.' Executives from companies such as Wix, Wiz, AppsFlyer, Aleph, Melio, and Overwolf will also share their perspectives on branding strategies and industry trends. The Growing Importance of Branding For early-stage companies operating with limited resources, branding can serve as a powerful tool to compete with more established players and gain visibility in saturated markets. A startup’s brand reflects its identity, values, and the commitment it makes to its customers. In the early stages of a business, a well-defined brand can help build credibility and foster trust—two critical factors in attracting initial users and standing out in a competitive landscape. Strong branding helps businesses establish emotional connections with customers, distinguish themselves from competitors, and maintain a consistent message across different channels. For startups operating on tight budgets, a strategic approach to branding can be especially valuable, as it can drive organic growth and word-of-mouth marketing without requiring significant advertising investments. A well-defined brand identity can also encourage early adopters to become advocates, helping to expand awareness through their networks. Many companies that have undergone successful rebrands demonstrate that adaptation is often essential for growth. As businesses evolve and shift focus, their branding may need to change accordingly. A strong brand identity should also align with the company’s purpose, clearly conveying what it does and the problem it aims to solve. Timing plays a critical role as well—when done at the right moment, rebranding can reinforce new directions and attract media attention, helping companies reposition themselves in competitive markets. Global Participation with Israeli Expertise The event is expected to welcome 600 in-person attendees, including CMOs, brand managers, founders, and technology leaders, with thousands more joining virtually from around the world. To accommodate a diverse audience, the summit will provide bilingual content in Hebrew and English, along with live translation services. Running from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM, the summit will feature case studies, interactive sessions, and networking opportunities. Early registration is open until February 27, 2025.

Two Palestinians from Nablus suspected of receiving tens of thous...	Israeli police and the Shin Bet arrested two Palestinian residents of Nablus on suspicion of contacting Hamas operatives abroad to secure funding for terrorist activities in the West Bank, police said on Monday. During the investigation, authorities seized $35,200 and 33,000 shekels. The two suspects, accused of receiving Hamas funds via bank transfers, were arrested and interrogated over the past month. On Sunday, prosecutors filed a statement of intent to indict them on charges including contact with a foreign agent, receiving enemy funds, membership in and activity for a hostile organization, and providing services to such a group.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1gewz3sje	2025-03-09T23:14:29-07:00

‘I don't know if they will ever find her’: Murdered female hostag...	Families of Inbar Haiman, Judy Weinstein-Haggai, and Ofra Keidar — murdered on October 7 and still held by Hamas — demand justice and closure as Israel grapples with the ethical and emotional toll of unresolved grief After the conclusion of the first phase of the hostage deal with Hamas, the bodies of three women — Inbar Haiman, Judy Weinstein-Haggai, and Ofra Keidar — are still being held by Hamas in Gaza. The three were murdered by terrorists on October 7 and their bodies were abducted. 'If the situation were different, Inbar would probably be at the forefront of every protest, not resting until all the hostages were returned. She was highly principled, opinionated and deeply compassionate. Her life was filled with action and giving,' said her father, Haim Haiman. ‘Art was her life’ Inbar, who studied visual communication in Haifa, was supposed to complete her studies last year. 'We were invited to the graduate exhibition. There were works by all the graduates, including Inbar, but they left a blank wall for her. Art was her life. She was a nature-loving girl who hiked the Israel National Trail. She must be brought to rest in the land she loved so much,' her father added. The families of Inbar, Judy and Ofra received word that their loved ones had been murdered on October 7, 2023, but Hamas took their bodies to Gaza. 'We are in a sort of limbo,' said Iris Weinstein-Haggai, Judy’s daughter. 'There is no forensic confirmation and the psychological terror in my mind tells me that I can’t be certain of it until she is home. Maybe she is still there, waiting for us to save her? We are stuck between worlds, relying on intelligence reports while envying those who have been able to bury their loved ones.' ‘She was the softest, happiest person’ Judy was murdered after witnessing the murder of her husband, Gadi Haggai. 'It’s hard to separate my mother from my father. She made aliyah to Israel from Canada and fell in love with kibbutz life. She was the softest, happiest person I knew and my moral compass,' Iris said. Judy was a teacher in the Kibbutz Nirim schools and introduced mindfulness techniques into classrooms to help children develop resilience. She had retired and was set to begin her dream job — teaching mindfulness through puppetry — after the Jewish high holidays. 'Every morning, she wrote a haiku poem and posted it on Facebook. Then she and my father would go for a walk in the fields — that’s when they were taken.' ‘The first victim of Kibbutz Be’eri’ Ofra Keidar was also murdered while on her morning walk and is believed to have been the first victim of Kibbutz Be’eri. 'She was just two kilometers (1.2 miles) from the kibbutz,' said her son, Oren. 'The terrorists on motorcycles murdered her even before they reached Be’eri. They likely took her body only on their way back.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I have come to a certain acceptance. I don't know if they will ever find her,' he continued. 'I imagine the moment when the liaison officer will call me and say, ‘Come to the forensic institute, we found your mother.’ But I know there’s a chance we will never recover her body.' Oren believes his mother would have told him to stop dwelling on the past. 'She was a pragmatic woman who didn’t care for sentimentality. She was a dairy farmer for 40 years, working with calves. She wasn’t the type to show affection with hugs and kisses but she did everything for us. 'My sister, Yael, has special needs. Despite doctors saying she would never communicate, my parents refused to accept that. Every week, they took her from Be’eri to Jerusalem for therapy. Now Yael reads, writes and speaks — all because of my mother’s determination.' Even in her final moments, Ofra remained true to herself. 'My brother managed to record her last conversation. She was naïve — she thought they were Bedouins trying to steal. She yelled at them, ‘Enough already, stop it.’ She was in her own world,' Oren said. 'We need to focus on the living before the dead but I fear she will end up like Ron Arad — her burial place unknown.' ‘Holding women’s bodies hostage is inhumane’ Haim Haiman, Inbar’s father, expressed his frustration: 'The fact that Hamas is still holding the bodies of these women is a failure. The fact that there are hostages at all is a failure and after a year and a half, it’s even more so. There are difficulties in implementing the next phase of the deal and I don’t have the answers. 'But my real fear is that Inbar will disappear as time goes on. We will never be able to hold her, to kiss her, to help her heal. All we can hope for is to bring back her body so we can begin our own healing. The sorrow and heartbreak deepen every day. Losing a child is the most painful thing imaginable and it is beyond inhumane when you can’t even bury them.' Iris Weinstein-Haggai shared her anger: 'I’m from Kibbutz Nir Oz and Shiri Bibas (who was murdered in captivity) was my neighbor. It pains me that not all the women were included in the hostage deal. What kind of world are we living in where they keep women’s bodies as bargaining chips? 'I want to be able to visit my mother’s grave on Memorial Day — assuming she really was murdered. My daughter recently asked me, ‘How do you know they’re dead if there’s no grave?’ My mother was a 70-year-old woman who weighed 45 kilograms (99 pounds), the smallest person in the world — and they are keeping her as leverage?' she added. 'The government doesn’t understand how crucial it is to bring back the deceased. It’s convenient for them to ignore 35 missing people that are an entire world in their own right.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjcmtw3j1e	2025-03-09T23:08:26-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/10/Sy6MIl2jyx/Sy6MIl2jyx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Syria’s Druze seek a place in a changing nation, navigating press...	Members of small religious sect find themselves caught between two forces that many of them distrust: new, Islamist-led government in Damascus and Israel, which used plight of Druze as pretext to intervene in the country Syria’s Druze minority has a long history of cutting their own path to survive among the country’s powerhouses. They are now trying again to navigate a new, uncertain Syria since the fall of longtime autocrat Bashar Assad. Members of the small religious sect find themselves caught between two forces that many of them distrust: the new, Islamist-led government in Damascus and Syria’s hostile neighbor, Israel, which has used the plight of the Druze as a pretext to intervene in the country. Syria’s many religious and ethnic communities are worried over their place in the new system. The transitional government has promised to include them, but has so far kept authority in the hands of the Islamist former insurgents who toppled Assad in December -- Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. That and HTS’s past affiliation with Sunni Muslim extremist al-Qaida, has minorities suspicious. The most explosive hostilities have been with the Alawite religious minority, to which Assad’s family belongs. Heavy clashes erupted this week between armed Assad loyalists and government forces, killing at least 70, in the coastal regions that are the Alawites’ heartland. In contrast, the Druze -- largely centered in southern Syria -- have kept up quiet contacts with the government. Still, tensions have broken out. Last week in Jaramana, a suburb of Damascus with a large Druze population, unknown gunmen killed a member of the government’s security forces, which responded with a wave of arrests in the district. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and military officials weighed in by threatening to send forces to Jaramana to protect the Druze. Druze leaders quickly disavowed the offer. But soon after, someone hung an Israeli flag in Sweida, an overwhelmingly Druze region in southern Syria, prompting residents to quickly tear it down and burn it. Many fear another flare-up is only a matter of time. Multiple Druze armed militias have existed for years, originally set up to protect their communities against Islamic State group fighters and drug smugglers coming in from the eastern desert. They have been reluctant to set down their arms. Recently a new faction, the Sweida Military Council, proclaimed itself, grouping several smaller Druze militias. The result is a cycle of mistrust, where government supporters paint Druze factions as potential separatists or tools of Israel, while government hostility only deepens Druze worries. A struggle to unite a divided country On the outskirts of Sweida, a commander in Liwa al-Jabal, a Druze militia, stood on a rooftop and scanned the hills with binoculars. He spoke by walkie-talkie with a militiaman with an assault rifle below. They were watching for any movement by militants or gangs. 'Our arms are not for expansionist purposes. They’re for self-defense and protection,' said the commander, who asked to be identified only by his nickname Abu Ali for security reasons. 'We have no enemies except those who attack us.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Abu Ali, who is a metal worker as his day job, said most Druze militiamen would merge with a new Syrian army if it’s one that 'protects all Syrians rather than crushes them like the previous regime.' The Druze religious sect began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. Over half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed in 1981. In Syria, the Druze take pride in their fierce independence. They were heavily involved in revolts against Ottoman and French colonial rule to establish the modern Syrian state. During Syria’s civil war that began in 2011, the Druze were split between supporters of Assad and the opposition. The Sweida region stayed quiet for much of the war, though it erupted with anti-government protests in 2023. Assad reluctantly gave Druze a degree of autonomy, as they wanted to avoid being involved on the frontlines. The Druze were exempted from conscription into the Syrian army and instead set up local armed factions made of workers and farmers to patrol their areas. Druze say they want Syria’s new authorities to include them in a political process to create a secular and democratic state. 'Religion is for God and the state is for all' proclaimed a slogan written on the hood of a vehicle belonging to the Men of Dignity, another Druze militia patrolling the outskirts of Sweida. ‘Being inclusive will not hurt him’ Many Druze quickly rejected Israel’s claims to protect the minority. Hundreds took to the streets in Sweida to protest Netanyahu’s comments. 'We are Arabs, whether he or whether the Lord that created him likes it or not. Syria is free,' said Nabih al-Halabi, a 60-year-old resident of Jaramana. He and others reject accusations that the Druze want partition from Syria. But patience is wearing thin over what many see as arbitrary layoffs of public sector workers, shortage of economic opportunities, and the new authorities’ lack of more than token inclusion of Syrians from minority communities. For the first time, a protest took place in Sweida on Thursday against Damascus’ new authorities. Interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa has promised to create an inclusive system, but the government is made up mostly of his confidantes. The authorities convened a national dialogue conference last week, inviting Syrians from different communities, but many criticized it as rushed and not really inclusive. 'What we are seeing from the state today, in our opinion, does not achieve the interests of all Syrians,' said retired nurse Nasser Abou-Halam, discussing local politics with other residents in Sweida’s public square where near-daily protests took place. 'It’s a one-color government, with leadership appointed through factions rather than through elections.' Al-Sharaa 'has a big opportunity to be accepted just to be Syrian first and not Islamist first. Being inclusive will not hurt him,' said Bassam Barabandi, a former Syrian diplomat currently based in Washington. 'On the contrary, it will give him more power.' Economic woes shorten the honeymoon Syria’s new leaders have struggled to convince the United States and its allies to lift Assad-era sanctions. Without the lifting of sanctions, it will be impossible for the government to rebuild Syria’s battered infrastructure or win over minority communities, analysts say. 'I’m scared sanctions won’t be lifted and Syria won’t be given the chance,' said Rayyan Maarouf, who heads the activist media collective Suwayda 24. He has just returned to Sweida after fleeing to Europe over a year ago because of his activism. 'Syria could go back to a civil war, and it would be worse than before,' he said. Outside Sweida, Abu Ali was helping train new volunteers for the militia. Still, he said he hopes to be able to lay down his weapons. 'There is no difference between the son of Sweida or Jaramana and those of Homs and Lattakia,' he said. 'People are tired of war and bloodshed … weapons don’t bring modernism.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1bei112sjl	2025-03-09T23:05:15-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/10/Hk11656bnikx/Hk11656bnikx_0_185_2880_1622_0_small.jpg
Where Tradition Meets Technology: The Digital Revolution of Synag...	Easyshul is modernizing synagogue management with a comprehensive digital platform, bridging the gap between outdated systems and a modern, intuitive experience that enhances community engagement In collaboration with Easyshul For decades, synagogue administration has relied on outdated software, cumbersome manual tracking, and aging management systems that struggle to keep up with modern demands. Many communities still juggle spreadsheets for membership tracking, event coordination, and donation management—while others rely on legacy platforms that were cutting-edge a decade ago but now feel outdated and inefficient. The need for a more seamless and intuitive solution has been apparent for years, yet few platforms have truly addressed these challenges—until now. What happens when an Israeli startup decides to bring synagogue management into the 21st century? Easyshul is more than just another tech tool—it serves as a bridge between tradition and modernization, proving that even deeply rooted communities can embrace innovation in a natural way. Instead of complex systems requiring extensive training, poor customer service, and exhorbant processing costs, the platform offers an intuitive interface that allows members to pay dues, register for events, and contribute to causes—all without calling the synagogue office. Beyond simplifying administration, Easyshul is reshaping how synagogue communities engage, making participation easier and more accessible for all generations. This shift toward modernization is gaining traction among communities looking for efficient and accessible ways to manage their affairs. More Than Management: Strengthening Community Connections Easyshul, founded in 2022, is an all-in-one platform designed specifically for synagogue management, offering a streamlined approach to membership administration, event coordination, and fundraising. With an intuitive design, Easyshul provides synagogue administrators with tools to manage all these aspects in one centralized system, reducing operational disruptions and minimizing the transition effort for staff. Lior Shabat, co-founder and CEO of Easyshul, leveraged his decade of experience in Israel’s high-tech industry to develop a solution tailored to the specific needs of synagogue administrators. 'We created Easyshul with the goal of making synagogue management more efficient and user-friendly. Conversations with synagogue leaders highlighted the challenges of outdated systems, and we saw an opportunity to provide a more practical and responsive alternative,' said Shabat. 'The platform has helped numerous communities transition seamlessly, whether from legacy software or from managing synagogue affairs manually.' The Changing Face of Synagogue Management Easyshul allows members to manage their personal accounts independently, handling tasks such as paying dues, making donations, registering for events, and enrolling in educational programs. Administrators can efficiently set up and manage events, track attendance, and facilitate contributions toward specific causes or in memory of loved ones. The platform also includes advanced reporting tools and an integrated email and newsletter system, reducing the need for third-party service. Regina Melnik, Synagogue Administrator for Congregation Emanuel of the Hudson Valley, noted, 'Easyshul has been a reliable partner in streamlining our synagogue’s operations. Their team is proactive in addressing our needs and ensuring a smooth user experience. Managing a synagogue requires adaptability, and this platform has provided tools that support our growth and engagement.' With partners across the US, UK, Canada, and New Zealand, Easyshul brings modern technology to synagogue communities, combining innovative solutions with a focus on ease of use and responsive support. Easyshul is a cloud-based platform designed to simplify synagogue management through technology-driven solutions.

IDF warns of soldier shortage and extreme burden on troops in com...	With increased deployments, longer rotations, and fewer home leaves, IDF soldiers are expected to endure unprecedented strain as the military struggles to meet growing security demands More strain, more missions, and almost no time off—one of the most alarming failures revealed in investigations of the Oct. 7 terror attack was the IDF General Staff’s decision five years ago to reduce the number of combat troops stationed in security outposts on weekends by half. This move was primarily intended to boost motivation for enlisting in combat units. That decision—recently described by the IDF’s Southern Command as a 'mistake'—came at a heavy price on that tragic Saturday, particularly at sparsely defended outposts like Nahal Oz, where 53 soldiers lost their lives. The reversal of this policy is just the beginning of the military’s desperate effort to cope with an extreme, multi-front burden that is only expected to grow in the coming years—not just for reservists but for regular soldiers as well. The IDF’s Operations Directorate, responsible for force deployment across Israel’s borders and in the West Bank, estimates that Israel is entering a period of manpower shortages not seen since the days of the Security Zone in southern Lebanon, followed shortly by the Second Intifada in the early 2000s. The reason: Israeli policy, shaped by years of deceptive calm, now aims to prevent Hezbollah and Hamas from re-emerging as full-fledged military forces—like they were before the current war. The cost of that effort will be borne by Israeli society. Concern in the IDF General Staff Regular soldiers are already feeling the strain. According to senior officers, the grueling deployment schedule is unlikely to change in the coming years: 17 days on duty, followed by a short three- to four-day leave. That means a brief break for combat troops once every two and a half weeks—at best, once a month if there are no escalations, security alerts, or lockdowns. For the past 15 years, combat troops were able to go home once every two weeks. 'The Israeli public, new recruits, active soldiers, and especially their parents should adjust their expectations—they will see much less of their sons and daughters in the coming years,' the IDF warns. 'Even if prolonged combat in Gaza does not resume and even if fronts like southern Lebanon, Syria, and the West Bank remain ‘calm’ as they are now.' Military officials add, 'We are doing everything we can to ease the burden on reservists, who are completely exhausted. But regular combat troops will bear the brunt. We need thousands of soldiers to man the new outposts established inside Lebanese territory, in the Syrian Golan Heights, and along the Gaza Strip’s buffer zone. On top of that, we have doubled the number of regional battalions stationed around Gaza and the Galilee compared to the pre-war period. This new reality will not change in the coming years, even under the most optimistic scenarios.' The IDF General Staff—including newly appointed Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir—is deeply concerned about the severe manpower shortage, while political leaders remain indifferent. More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from IDF service since the war began. According to IDF data, approximately 12,000 soldiers—most of them combat troops—have been killed or wounded since Oct. 7. Additionally, the need for increased border defense and the rapid expansion of armored and engineering brigades have left the IDF with a growing manpower deficit, the burden of which will be felt by both current and future servicemembers through extreme workloads not seen in two decades. Another factor in the manpower shortage is one of Lt. Gen. Zamir’s first decisions: the creation of a new infantry brigade—the first since the 900th battalions were merged into the Kfir Brigade 20 years ago. The IDF currently has five active-duty infantry brigades in addition to Kfir: Nahal, Paratroopers, Golani, and Givati. At least one new engineering battalion will also be established, and tank brigade reconnaissance companies—shut down in the past decade—will be reinstated. These changes will require thousands of additional combat soldiers that the IDF currently lacks, meaning the burden will only increase for existing troops. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: To fill these ranks, the IDF is reaching out to older former combat soldiers in the civilian population, attempting to form new reserve brigades with volunteers aged 40 to 60. Despite high motivation, these units remain understaffed and rely on volunteers with varying levels of fitness and other personal constraints. 'We are stretched to the limit, and every IDF combat soldier feels it already,' officials say. 'Even in basic training, new recruits are affected by the burden. After just two months of infantry training, some platoons are sent to reinforce active units for a week or two, cutting into their own training. The only way to break this cycle is to add forces at an unprecedented scale. The number of rapid-response units—the forces that must be on standby for major incidents—has tripled or quadrupled, and this will not change.' Military sources dismissed claims that the newly formed 'Hasmonean Brigade' is a meaningful solution. 'It’s misleading to present it as a full-fledged ultra-Orthodox combat brigade when, in reality, only one company has been recruited so far. It’s not even a band-aid for the IDF’s combat manpower crisis.' Holding ground instead of raids The challenges are not limited to Gaza, the West Bank, or the northern border. Even soldiers stationed along Israel’s traditionally quieter Arava border, primarily tasked with stopping drug and weapons smuggling from Sinai, describe the hardship of going home just once every two and a half weeks. 'Of our four days off, we lose an entire day traveling home. When we ask to swap leave schedules, commanders agree only if the adjustment results in an even longer stretch of service, sometimes requiring us to serve 21 consecutive days before a break.' However, these extreme conditions might be the best-case scenario. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, a key component of the IDF’s new war plan, developed under Lt. Gen. Zamir, includes permanently holding parts of Gaza—rather than conducting repeated raids, a strategy that has drawn criticism from right-wing circles. A scaled-down version of this 'hold-and-secure' approach is already in place. IDF troops remain stationed along the Philadelphi Corridor near Egypt, and forces have yet to withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor in northern Gaza. If the new offensive strategy leads to a permanent military presence in Khan Younis or the outskirts of Gaza City’s Shati and Rimal neighborhoods, the burden on IDF combat personnel will only grow at the expense of essential training for other fronts. One of the IDF Operations Directorate’s strategies for managing the strain is to send entire units on short leave periods of five to seven days, as was done with Givati and Nahal battalions after a month or two of continuous combat in Gaza. While this offers a brief reprieve, it comes only after 50 to 60 days without seeing home, depending on mission intensity. 'Reservists are the first to receive any relief. We’re trying to ensure they don’t serve more than two and a half months in 2025, but many will still be called up for two extended deployments within a year,' IDF sources said. Uncertainty remains over the IDF’s broader plans for Gaza. The political leadership recently authorized another mass call-up of hundreds of thousands of reservists under the open-ended emergency mobilization order. But many reserve commanders have warned officials about the toll this has taken. 'Even with staggered rotations, only 50% to 70% of reservists currently respond to call-ups due to prolonged absences from work, studies, and family life. The strain cannot be eased with money alone. 'For large-scale operations in Gaza, more people might answer the call. But they have already fought there and in Lebanon for months. Family pressures are mounting—everyone is asking, ‘Why can’t someone else do their part?’ This must be factored into future planning, as it will impact force availability for future missions.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryvq00uiikg	2025-03-09T22:25:27-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/08/yk14287447/yk14287447_0_0_1976_1214_0_small.jpg

Jewish leader: Diaspora Jews are 'warriors for Israel'	Hadassa Getsztain, Chairperson of the World Jewish Congress in Israel: Jewish communities in the Diaspora are facing challenges too Like Israel, Jewish communities in the Diaspora are facing challenges—though of a different kind, according to Hadassa Getsztain, Chairperson of the World Jewish Congress in Israel. She said Jews living in the Diaspora are 'warriors for Israel,' not only because of the support they provide to the country but also due to the rising antisemitism they face.

Expert warns: Trump’s threats may backfire on Iran talks	Thamar Gindin: 'With both Hamas and the Islamic Republic, threats only make them more adamant in their opposition to peace or nuclear talks' U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat may make negotiations with Iran more difficult, according to Thamar Gindin of the University of Haifa. 'Lately, [Trump] just threatens everyone, and he doesn’t take into consideration the psychology of the other side,' Gindin told ILTV News. 'With both Hamas and the Islamic Republic, threats only make them more adamant in their opposition to peace or nuclear talks.

Columbia’s antisemitism problem: It’s time to hold universities a...	Comment: Academic freedom cannot thrive where Jewish students’ civil rights are repeatedly violated by anti-American, jihad-supporting radicals Columbia University is once again making headlines for anti-Israel protests, but this time, action is finally being taken. Since October 7, dozens of American campuses have been overrun by Hamas-supporting mobs harassing and even physically assaulting Jewish students. According to U.S. intelligence, many of these campus protests received foreign funding from regimes such as Iran. Hamas itself has praised students engaging in domestic terrorism and displays of anti-American hate, including burning the American flag. This week, students at Columbia not only protested against Israel but also hung flyers stating 'Death to America' and displayed photos of Yahya Sinwar. They blocked campus entrances, prevented students and faculty from attending classes, and barricaded themselves inside a Barnard College building, injuring a staff member. Instead of immediately allowing the NYPD to arrest the protesters, the university delayed action to negotiate—a tactic it has repeatedly used, even as mobs continue to harass Jewish students and make campuses unsafe. Now, the Trump administration is stepping in to hold universities accountable. The U.S. Department of Justice has launched investigations into 10 universities, including Columbia, for failing to protect Jewish students’ rights. Additionally, the administration announced a $400 million cut in contracts and grants to Columbia over its handling of antisemitism. This announcement came just days after the U.S. State Department revoked the first student visa of a foreign pro-Hamas protester. While eliminating foreign subversion on campuses is a challenge, these first steps should be a relief to all students, regardless of political stance. Academic freedom cannot thrive where Jewish students’ civil rights are repeatedly violated by anti-American, jihad-supporting radicals. Those seeking to destroy Israel, the U.S., and American values should not be welcomed on campus, and universities that allow this behavior must be held accountable.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk2jbl2syx	2025-03-09T21:03:28-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/07/BkRtE600iyl/BkRtE600iyl_0_0_853_481_0_small.jpg
Trump envoy sparks criticism over Hamas talks - and US's new outl...	Following backlash, Adam Boehler posts clarification on social media: 'Hamas is a terrorist organization; No Hamas member will be safe unless it releases all hostages immediately' The U.S. envoy for hostage affairs, Adam Boehler, confirmed he had held direct negotiations with senior Hamas officials, sparking criticism from both Israeli officials and former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman. Israeli cabinet ministers called Boehler’s statements in a series of interviews on Sunday 'unnecessary,' while Friedman sharply condemned the Trump administration official’s actions. Following the backlash, and possibly other reprimands, Boehler posted a clarification on social media: 'I want to be clear because some misunderstood—Hamas is a terrorist organization that has murdered thousands of innocent people. By definition, they are bad actors. As President Trump said, no Hamas member will be safe unless Hamas releases all the hostages immediately.' Friedman, in a separate post, criticized Boehler’s diplomatic approach. 'Over the past week, President Trump brilliantly presented Hamas with a binary choice—release all the hostages and surrender, or be destroyed. That is the only way to end the war,' Friedman wrote. 'If I understood Boehler’s comments today correctly, he took the unprecedented step of meeting with Hamas to explore a third option—whether Hamas could be 'involved' in governing Gaza.' Friedman dismissed any negotiations with Hamas as futile, writing, 'A deal with Hamas is a waste of time and will never hold. Attempting one is beneath the dignity of the United States. Adam, I know you mean well—but listen to your boss. The choice must remain binary.' Meanwhile, the Israeli cabinet convened ahead of a planned delegation trip to Qatar for hostage negotiations. Ministers were briefed on the mission but were not asked to formally approve a mandate. The delegation is expected to explore a framework proposed by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, which includes the release of 10 hostages, including U.S. citizen Idan Alexander, in exchange for a 60-day cease-fire and renewed humanitarian aid to Gaza. Those hostages are reported to be suffering from torture in Hamas captivity. Boehler revealed details of Hamas' proposals during his direct talks, hinting that the U.S. is not ruling out a long-term truce between Hamas and Israel. His statements appeared to partially confirm reports from Israeli sources that negotiations to free American hostages had failed. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In an interview with Israel’s Kan News, Boehler said Hamas had offered a deal involving 'the release of all hostages and prisoners, along with a five- to ten-year cease-fire, during which Hamas would disarm, and the U.S., along with other countries, would ensure there are no more tunnels or military activity, and that Hamas would no longer be involved in politics.' He did not rule out the possibility of a hostage release in the near future, saying, 'If I’m optimistic, I’d say weeks.' Speaking on CNN’s State of the Union, Boehler left open the possibility of further meetings with Hamas, stating that 'something could happen regarding Gaza and the hostages within weeks,' without elaborating. His remarks followed an Israeli official’s assertion that the talks had not yielded progress. Boehler also acknowledged Israel’s frustration over Washington’s contacts with Hamas. 'I understand why the Israelis are upset, but we are the United States—we are not Israel’s agents, and we have our own interests,' he said. He added that his meetings with Hamas representatives had been authorized by President Trump and were 'very useful in advancing the release of the hostages.' During Sunday’s cabinet meeting, several ministers reiterated their criticism of Boehler, arguing that such diplomatic efforts should be coordinated with Israel. However, others downplayed the controversy, saying the focus should be on the upcoming Doha talks based on Witkoff’s framework. The cabinet did not discuss Defense Minister Israel Katz’s proposal to prepare for the relocation of Gaza’s population to a third country. The meeting was also the first attended by new IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir, who was welcomed by ministers and appeared to have good rapport with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar, recently removed by Netanyahu as head of Israel’s negotiating team, was absent from the session. During the meeting, Minister for Settlements and National Missions Orit Strock urged Zamir to halt the deployment of female soldiers to guard Hamas prisoners. 'We worked hard to end the practice of female conscripts guarding security prisoners in Israeli prisons,' she told Zamir. 'Now I am asking you personally to stop this intolerable situation.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bksqpfssjl	2025-03-09T14:00:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/09/rk11B4tooyl/rk11B4tooyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah chief: Reaching Netanyahu's home proves our capabilitie...	In first interview since assuming leadership, Naim Qassem acknowledged security 'flaws' and 'breaches' within the terror group but denied it had been defeated Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem acknowledged security 'flaws' and 'breaches' within the militant group but denied it had been defeated in recent conflicts, saying, 'We reached an agreement, we stopped the fire, and our capabilities remain intact.' In his first interview since assuming leadership in late October following the assassination of his predecessor, Hassan Nasrallah, Qassem spoke to Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Manar TV on Sunday. Addressing the group's fighters, he urged them to stand firm: 'Just as you have always held your heads high, remain that way. You are Nasrallah’s sons. His funeral was a ‘victory declaration’ in the way we believe. We persisted until the very last moment of securing the agreement.' Qassem expressed gratitude to Iranian, Iraqi, Palestinian, and Yemeni representatives who attended Nasrallah's funeral despite travel restrictions. He also revealed that following Nasrallah’s killing, he had initially asked Hashem Safi al-Din, then head of Hezbollah’s Executive Council, to take over as leader. However, days later, the Israeli military carried out an airstrike in Beirut’s Dahiyeh district, killing Safi al-Din as well. 'We are conducting investigations to learn lessons and hold people accountable,' Qassem said, adding that Hezbollah had made 'battlefield adjustments.' He also referenced the drone attack that struck Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea, stating, 'Hezbollah reaching Netanyahu’s home proves our capabilities remain.' Qassem insisted that while Hezbollah had paid a high price, its 'resistance' against Israel would continue. 'We are in a new phase where the fundamental principles remain unchanged, but the methods, tactics, and timing have evolved,' he said. 'We face new equations that will not be dictated by Israel. Let the state seize this opportunity through political action and demonstrate to the world that Israel does not retreat through diplomacy—it retreats through war and resistance. Israel understands only the language of weapons.' Discussing the conflict with Israel, Qassem claimed Hezbollah had the ability to strike 'any target we chose' but had limited its attacks to military objectives 'to deny the enemy an excuse.' He dismissed speculation about secret clauses in the cease-fire agreement, saying, 'The agreement is what was declared and published—there are no hidden terms.' Hezbollah's leader also warned Israel about maintaining a military presence at five strategic locations inside Lebanese territory. 'I say to the Israelis—if you stay in these positions, how long do you think it will last? The resistance will not allow you to remain there,' he said. 'If the occupation persists, the army, the people, and the resistance will confront it. We have no ties to any agreement between the U.S. and Israel.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Qassem described Iran as a 'friendly country' and called for the resumption of flights between Lebanon and Iran, which Israel has sought to limit over concerns about arms and financial transfers to Hezbollah. He also accused the U.S. of interfering in Lebanon’s government appointments, saying, 'We are evaluating how to deal with this intervention.' Addressing the possibility of a regional war involving the U.S. and Iran, Qassem asserted that Iran had the strength, leadership, and decision-making ability to defend itself. 'If the Americans launch a war against Iran, their losses will be significant, and the global consequences will be extraordinary,' he warned. At the end of the interview, Qassem grew emotional as he addressed Hezbollah terrorists and those wounded in recent operations, referring to them as 'our living martyrs.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skrd8tjsyg	2025-03-09T13:31:19-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/02/rJ11ANDsbw0/rJ11ANDsbw0_0_182_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Israeli student arrested in Poland for Nazi salute at Auschwitz	High schooler made gesture beneath 'Arbeit Macht Frei' ('Work Sets You Free') sign at entrance to former Nazi camp; he was detained and later released after being fined 1,500 zloty (about $370) A 12th-grade Israeli student was arrested Sunday after performing a Nazi salute at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp during a school trip to Poland. The student, who was visiting the site with his high school delegation from northern Israel, made the gesture beneath the 'Arbeit Macht Frei' ('Work Sets You Free') sign at the entrance to the former Nazi camp. He was detained and later released after being fined 1,500 zloty (about $370). Israel’s Education Ministry said it was treating the incident with 'the utmost severity' and that the student would face disciplinary measures upon returning home. 'This behavior is entirely unacceptable, contradicts the values of Israeli education, and undermines the significance of the trip to Poland,' the ministry said in a statement. The Auschwitz-Birkenau museum condemned the act, calling the Nazi salute a symbol of the antisemitic ideology responsible for the suffering and murder of millions during World War II. 'Committing such an act at the historical site, where Nazi Germany murdered approximately one million Jews, along with tens of thousands of Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war and others, is not only deeply offensive and morally reprehensible but also a violation of the law,' the museum said. Security personnel reported the incident to police, who launched an investigation. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The student’s high school said it was addressing the matter internally and that the act did not reflect the values of the institution. The municipality where the school is located said it was also investigating. The student told authorities he had been waving rather than making a Nazi salute. Polish law prohibits the public promotion of Nazi symbols, with violations punishable by up to two years in prison. In January, a Dutch tourist was arrested and fined for performing a Nazi salute at Auschwitz, which she later described as a 'bad joke.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1ze4usi1x	2025-03-09T12:13:39-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/SJqul5MBuJg/SJqul5MBuJg_0_313_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Syria death toll surpasses 1,000 as Alawites bear brunt of regime...	Al-Sharaa's government faces mounting chaos as clashes with Assad loyalists leave over 1,000 dead, including hundreds of Alawite civilians massacred in retaliatory attacks, sparking humanitarian and political crises Syria’s new Islamist-led government, under interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, announced Sunday the formation of what it called an independent investigative committee to examine the recent wave of violence in Alawite-majority coastal regions. Since Thursday, more than 1,300 people have been killed, including at least 830 Alawite civilians who were reportedly executed, according to emerging reports. The remaining fatalities include 481 fighters, both members of al-Sharaa’s security forces and loyalists of the ousted Assad regime. The violence erupted Thursday when Assad loyalists ambushed security forces in Latakia province, prompting fierce retaliation. Eyewitness accounts from the region describe Alawite civilians being rounded up and executed, with gunmen linked to the current government allegedly carrying out summary killings. Arabic media outlets aligned with the former government have reported additional massacres in Alawite villages over the past 24 hours. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights stated that numerous communities near Latakia have lost access to water and electricity due to the ongoing conflict. Clashes have also spread to neighboring Tartus province. A Syrian security official told Reuters that Assad loyalists have targeted infrastructure, including power stations, in an effort to disrupt the government’s hold on the region. Meanwhile, government forces continue searching mountainous areas where an estimated 5,000 Assad loyalists are believed to be hiding. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: As the violence escalated, President al-Sharaa sought to distance his administration from the reported massacres, asserting that rogue elements were responsible for civilian deaths. The government acknowledged that the influx of fighters into the region had resulted in human rights violations but insisted it remained committed to protecting all religious and ethnic communities. During dawn prayers at a Damascus mosque on Sunday, al-Sharaa addressed the situation, saying, 'What’s happening in Syria now is part of the expected challenges. We must maintain national unity and civil peace. There’s no threat to the country. We urge Syrians to remain confident that the state has the means to endure. We can live together in this country.' International reactions have been swift. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio strongly condemned the violence, calling on Syrian authorities to prosecute what he termed 'radical Islamist terrorists' responsible for the executions. He reaffirmed Washington’s support for Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy echoed those concerns, calling the reports from Syria’s coastal regions 'horrifying.' The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, urged an immediate end to the killings, warning of ethnic-based executions carried out by multiple actors, including members of both the current and former regimes. Meanwhile, protests erupted in Damascus on Sunday, with demonstrators calling for justice for the Alawite victims. Security forces dispersed the gathering after clashes broke out between protesters and counter-protesters. Some participants demanded accountability for the massacres, while others, aligned with the Islamist-led government, chanted in favor of establishing a Sunni state. Eyewitness accounts from the affected areas describe entire families being executed, homes burned, and bodies left in the streets. A resident of Baniyas told Ynet on Sunday morning that gunmen from the Shaheen Brigades, a drone unit previously used by Syrian rebels, had attacked Alawite villages. 'They’re targeting the villages, burning homes, and killing civilians,' he said. Many Alawites have fled their homes, some seeking refuge at the Russian military base in Hmeimim. Others have attempted to escape to Lebanon, with displaced individuals calling for international intervention. 'We are refugees without a homeland,' said Jafar Ali, a 32-year-old Alawite who fled the violence. 'We need countries to open humanitarian migration channels for Alawites.' The Syrian government has vowed to investigate the massacres and bring those responsible to justice. However, human rights groups have raised concerns about ongoing reprisals, warning that the conflict risks further spiraling into sectarian violence. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syb9ugsokx	2025-03-09T11:17:25-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/09/HJ2TQ69oyg/HJ2TQ69oyg_1_194_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF appoints new military spokesperson as Hagari closes tenure	Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin is a veteran tank commander who was severely wounded in 2006 Lebanon War; most recently, he served as head of military’s international cooperation unit Two days after effectively dismissing Brig. Gen. Daniel Hagari, newly appointed IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir on Sunday named Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin as the next IDF spokesperson. The appointment was approved by Defense Minister Israel Katz. Defrin, a veteran officer, was severely wounded while fighting in the Second Lebanon War’s Battle of Wadi Saluki as a tank battalion commander. Most recently, he served as head of the IDF’s international cooperation unit. He will replace Hagari following a transition period.

Mahmoud Khali's lawyer says Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who took him into custody were executing State Department order to revoke his student visa A prominent Palestinian activist who helped lead Columbia University’s student encampment movement was arrested Saturday night by federal immigration authorities who claimed they were acting on a State Department order to revoke his green card, according to his attorney. Mahmoud Khalil was at his university-owned apartment blocks from Columbia’s Manhattan campus when several Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents entered the building and took him into custody, his attorney, Amy Greer, told The Associated Press. One of the agents told Greer by phone that they were executing a State Department order to revoke Khalil’s student visa. Informed by the attorney that Khalil, who graduated in December, was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too, according to the lawyer. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The arrest comes as President Donald Trump vows to deport foreign students and imprison 'agitators' involved in protests against Israel’s war in Gaza. The administration has placed particular scrutiny on Columbia, announcing Friday that it would be cutting $400 million in grants and contracts because of what the government describes as the Ivy League school’s failure to squelch antisemitism on campus. The authorities declined to tell Khalil’s wife, who is eight months pregnant, why he was being detained, Greer said. Khalil has since been transferred to an immigration detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. 'We have not been able to get any more details about why he is being detained,' Greer told The AP. 'This is a clear escalation. The administration is following through on its threats.' A spokesperson for Columbia said law enforcement agents must produce a warrant before entering university property. The spokesperson declined to say if the school had received a warrant for Khalil’s arrest. Messages seeking comment were left with the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and ICE. Khalil had become one of the most visible faces of the pro-Palestinian movement at Columbia. As Columbia students erected tents on campus last spring, Khalil was picked to serve as a negotiator on behalf of students and met frequently with university administrators. When classes resumed in September, he told The Associated Press that the protests would continue: 'As long as Columbia continues to invest and to benefit from Israeli apartheid, the students will continue to resist.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byxwpssskl	2025-03-09T08:59:19-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/30/Bk11S11ml8ke/Bk11S11ml8ke_0_95_1417_798_0_small.jpg

They were shattered, terrorized' | New details on gang rape of I...	In brutal attack near Sanapur, Israeli tourist was raped, man was killed, and others were assaulted; survivors describe night of terror, recalling threats, violence, and desperate escape Indian media released additional details Sunday about the gang rape of an Israeli tourist and the deadly assault near the village of Sanapur in Karnataka state. Among the victims were the Israeli woman who was raped, a local guesthouse owner, an American tourist, and a local traveler. A third man who was with the group drowned after the attackers threw him and his companions into a canal. According to the police complaint, the assailants threatened to crush the heads of the three men with stones before throwing them into the water and raping the two women. In the canal, American tourist Daniel Pittas managed to grab the hand of Pankaj Amrit Rao Patil, and despite the strong current, he swam with him to the shore. The third man, identified as a traveler named Bibash, was swept downstream. The survivors only saw his broken watch floating on the water. They returned to the spot where they had been attacked and found the two women. 'They were devastated, crying, with terror on their faces,' one of the survivors recalled. The group then made their way back to the guesthouse and later filed a complaint with the police. Attack began with a request for fuel The guesthouse owner, who also reported the attack to police, described the events leading up to the assault. 'After dinner, we decided to go stargazing. We rode our scooters to the banks of the Tungabhadra Canal, near Sanapur Lake. As we were watching the stars and playing the guitar, around 10:30 p.m., three men on a motorcycle approached us and asked for fuel,' she said. She told them that there was no gas station nearby and suggested they find fuel in Sanapur. According to her testimony, one of the men suddenly demanded 100 rupees. 'They didn’t know us, so I told them I had no money. But they kept demanding, until one of the male tourists gave them 20 rupees.' When the travelers refused to give them more money, the suspects began arguing and threatening them with stones. Two of them then attacked and raped the women, while the third pushed the men into the canal and assaulted the guesthouse owner with stones. 'I was bleeding heavily. Two of the suspects dragged me to the side of the canal. One of them choked me and removed my clothes. One after the other, they beat me and raped me,' she said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The attackers stole her bag and fled with two mobile phones and 9,500 rupees. One of the men dragged the Israeli tourist away and raped her as well. 'When we screamed and cried, they fled on their motorcycle,' she recounted. Survivors recovering in hospital Ruth Korczak, an Israeli traveler in southern India, visited the hospital where the four survivors were treated. Speaking to ynet, she said she knows one of the surviving men. 'I got a call from him and went to visit him at the hospital. The two men who survived are doing okay—I saw them myself. I can’t share their personal experiences because they specifically asked me not to, but as has been reported, they were hit with stones, pushed into the canal, and that was it. They still haven’t fully processed what happened.' Regarding the Israeli woman’s condition, Korczak said: 'I can’t say anything about her. She’s okay. She’s in contact with the consulate, and they’re taking care of her.' Asked if arrangements were being made to return her to Israel, she replied: 'I can’t say.' Korczak added that despite the attack, she and other travelers still feel safe in the area. 'We had a tough day, but the sense of security returned quickly. We’ve heard a lot about what happened, including a lot of nonsense on social media about women traveling in India. The reactions have gotten out of control. That’s why it’s important for us to say that we feel safe here. Bad things can happen anywhere.' Another traveler, Hannah Bella, addressed suggestions that women in India should always be accompanied by men. 'They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. We have amazing Indian friends here,' she said. Korczak agreed, adding: 'This is a very safe place. The only takeaway is not to wander around late at night, just like I wouldn’t do in certain places back home. This was an area with no cell reception.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryoekrijyg	2025-03-09T08:47:43-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/09/Syl9CzSqsJg/Syl9CzSqsJg_1_89_800_451_0_small.jpg
Turkey blocks Israel from NATO execise: 'Wielding veto as politic...	Decision follows meeting between Israeli diplomats and defense alliance representatives, during which to there was strong enthusiasm for Jerusalem's participation Turkey has blocked Israel from taking part in NATO’s annual exercise on 'resilience and emergency preparedness,' according to reports received by Israel’s Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem on Sunday. The decision follows a meeting about two weeks ago between Israeli diplomats, NATO’s coordinating team for the drill, and Bulgaria’s delegation to the alliance. During the meeting, there was reportedly strong enthusiasm for Israel’s participation. Turkey’s move could derail Israel’s involvement in the exercise. NATO decisions require consensus, and without an active partnership agreement, there is no bureaucratic mechanism to compel Turkey to allow Israel to participate in the alliance’s official activities. NATO currently has 32 member states from North America and Europe. An Israeli official accused Turkey of using its veto power as a political tool. 'Turkey’s position undermines regional cooperation and NATO’s ability to address global challenges,' the official said. 'Instead of promoting unity and collective security, Turkey is wielding its veto in a way that harms strategic partnerships. Blocking Israel’s cooperation with NATO does not contribute to stability; rather, it undermines the alliance’s core values.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, Turkey has consistently blocked NATO-Israel cooperation, arguing that the alliance should not engage with Israel until the conflict ends. In the past, Ankara unsuccessfully attempted to prevent Israel from obtaining observer status in NATO but withdrew its opposition following a brief diplomatic reconciliation between the two countries. Turkey has since vetoed all NATO interactions with Israel, including meetings and joint exercises. At NATO’s summit in July, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the alliance 'cannot continue its partnership with the Israeli government.' In response, then-Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz called on NATO to expel Turkey after Erdoğan hinted at possible military action against Israel. Turkish officials have argued that Israel’s actions in Gaza violate NATO’s fundamental principles, international law, and universal human rights. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj6nseisyg	2025-03-09T08:14:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/27/HJ4i3XEQ1l/HJ4i3XEQ1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Israel orders immediate cutoff of electricity to Gaza amid stalle...	Senior official says that cutting off water supply to is also under consideration as part of 'tool kit' to push Hamas into agreement Energy Minister and Cabinet member Eli Cohen has signed an order to immediately halt the supply of electricity to the Gaza Strip. 'In accordance with my authority, I am instructing the Israel Electric Corporation to stop the transfer of electricity to Gaza,' Cohen wrote in his directive. His decision was made independently and was not based on a government or cabinet resolution. A senior Israeli official said that cutting off water supply to Gaza is also under consideration. 'As part of Israel’s toolbox, severing water pipelines to Gaza is on the table. The first pipeline to be cut would be the one supplying northern Gaza, but no decision has been made yet,' the official said. At the outset of the war, Israel announced it would cease supplying electricity to Gaza. However, under pressure from the United States and European countries, the supply initially continued. The Gaza Electricity Company had previously extended cables along Salah al-Din Street to directly power a desalination and wastewater treatment facility west of Deir al-Balah using electricity from Israel. Since the outbreak of the war on October 7, Israel has not supplied electricity to Gaza, except for one line—known as the Qalaa line—which directly powers desalination facilities. At the beginning of the war, approximately 10 power lines from Israel supplied Gaza, but most were subsequently disabled. Aside from the single remaining Israeli power line, Hamas has relied on generators to provide electricity to residents. Gaza’s power plant ceased operations early in the war. If Hamas runs out of fuel—following Israel’s recent decision to halt humanitarian aid deliveries and close border crossings—it will no longer be able to operate the generators. International aid organizations estimate that Hamas has enough fuel to run generators for approximately 45 more days. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Israeli military has recently stated that maintaining the Qalaa power line was necessary to prevent the spread of disease, which could endanger both hostages and soldiers operating in the area. However, Cohen has now ordered a complete halt to the transfer of electricity. Last week, the municipality of Deir al-Balah announced that Israel had cut off electricity to two desalination plants that supply 70% of the city’s water needs. Israeli officials, however, stated that there had been no deliberate cutoff and that a local malfunction had disrupted supply. They said repairs had not yet been approved due to ongoing military operations in the area. The Israel Defense Forces previously justified supplying electricity to the desalination plant last summer, explaining that it provided drinking water to displaced residents in Mawasi, Khan Younis, and Deir al-Balah before the withdrawal from the Netzarim corridor as part of a cease-fire arrangement. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich had opposed the electricity supply to Gaza, criticizing infrastructure repairs six months ago. 'We have completely lost our minds. We are rehabilitating Gaza with our own hands before its demilitarization—especially its hospitals, which serve as terror hubs,' he said at the time. 'Prime Minister, stop this folly. This time, no one will be able to say we didn’t know.' Last week, following Israel’s decision to halt humanitarian aid to Gaza, Smotrich welcomed the move. 'This is a step in the right direction, and I can assure you it is only the beginning,' he said. 'We are closing the gates of paradise and preparing to open the gates of hell. The next step will be cutting off electricity and water, followed by an intense, deadly, and rapid attack that will lead to the conquest of the territory and the implementation of the Trump plan to encourage emigration from Gaza.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hychq4js1g	2025-03-09T07:34:57-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/22/Bk27frvqJx/Bk27frvqJx_0_223_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Trump envoy says hostage talks with Hamas were 'very helpful'	POTUS' special hostage envoy says that he believes something could come together on Gaza within weeks; 'probably all the hostages are going to be released, not only Americans' U.S. President Donald Trump's hostage envoy Adam Boehler said on Sunday that American meetings with Hamas on the release of hostages held in Gaza were 'very helpful' and he did not rule out additional encounters with the Palestinian terror group. Boehler said in an interview on NBC's 'Meet the Press' that he believed something could come together on Gaza within weeks, but did not elaborate. However, he did note that 'probably all the hostages are going to be released, not only Americans.' His remarks came after an unnamed senior Israeli official claimed earlier in the day that no progress had been made in the negotiations. Boehler, who has been leading direct U.S. engagement with Hamas, also addressed Israeli frustration over Washington’s decision to hold these talks. While acknowledging Israeli concerns, he stressed that the United States was acting in its own interests and was not an agent of Israel. He said the meetings had been authorized by President Donald Trump and were focused on advancing the release of hostages. Israeli officials who spoke with American counterparts said Washington was 'shocked' by Israel’s opposition to the discussions with Hamas, particularly by alleged attempts to create tensions between Boehler and U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. According to American sources, Boehler was working under Witkoff’s direction, with all actions taken in coordination with him and with the approval of President Trump. They rejected claims of a 'good cop, bad cop' approach, insisting that U.S. efforts were fully coordinated. Israel’s Security Cabinet was set to meet later Sunday to finalize the mandate for a delegation traveling to Doha, Qatar, on Monday to engage in hostage negotiations. The delegation will be led by a senior Shin Bet official, along with Israel’s Coordinator for Hostages and Missing Persons Gal Hirsch, Dr. Ofir Falk, and representatives from the Mossad and Shin Bet. U.S. envoy Witkoff is also scheduled to arrive in Doha on Tuesday to assist in the discussions. Israeli officials said the delegation would remain in Qatar for two days, where it would discuss the 'Witkoff framework.' Officials suggested that flexibility could be possible if the talks showed signs of progress. The U.S. is focused on securing the release of 10 living hostages in exchange for a 60-day ceasefire and renewed humanitarian aid, according to a source familiar with the discussions. One proposal under consideration is prioritizing the release of hostages suffering from torture or those in urgent medical need. Meanwhile, Hamas official Taher al-Nunu confirmed to Reuters that the group’s leaders had held multiple meetings with Boehler as part of direct U.S.-Hamas contacts. However, prior to Boehler’s remarks, an Israeli official had stated that no progress had been made in the discussions. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamas also announced that a delegation led by senior official Mohammad Darwish met in Cairo with Egyptian intelligence chief Hassan Rashad to discuss key issues. An internal Israeli government memo sent to ministers reiterated that Israel would not accept any arrangement for Gaza that did not align with the war’s objectives: the return of all hostages, the dismantling of Hamas' military and governing capabilities, and the removal of the terrorist threat to Israeli citizens. The memo also stated that Israel retained the option to resume intense military operations if negotiations proved ineffective, noting that this position had been supported by both the previous and current U.S. administrations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ouiqjojl	2025-03-09T06:48:07-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/07/H1qEPMdiJl/H1qEPMdiJl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

I don't need the publicity': The Haredi businessman who gave Emi...	Shai Graucher, inspired by his late father’s charity work, unites wealthy US donors and Israeli war victims through lavish gifts, viral acts of kindness and a mission to showcase Jewish unity amid tragedy 'We came to offer support, but I feel like they’re the ones giving us strength,' a young ultra-Orthodox man told former hostages Keith and Aviva Siegel. The couple described the harsh reality of captivity in Gaza and their growing connection to religion. In another video, the same man is seen with IDF lookout Liri Albag, who teaches him how to make a precise heart shape with his hands. In another clip, he presents Emily Damari with a new luxury BMW, donated by a U.S. Jewish community. His name is Shai Graucher, an Israeli businessman whose phone number has been in high demand among soldiers, commanders and evacuees since the war began, as they seek assistance in securing supplies such as coats, generators, phones and chargers. Now, Graucher is visiting former hostages and their families, offering them encouragement and gifts — laptops, smartwatches, high-end headphones and approximately $10,000 in cash. Some of these meetings were documented and went viral online, even making it to news broadcasts. Others were kept private at the request of the hostages or bereaved families. Graucher sees his work not only as charity but as a mission — to show 'the beautiful face of the Jewish people.' 'At my father’s funeral, I made a commitment without realizing what I was predicting,' said Graucher, who leads a charity movement under the Klal Yisrael – Chesed v’Rachamim organization. 'I promised to continue my father’s path of giving. I knew I wanted to carry on his work, to care for widows and orphans. I was in a deep depression and this is what brought me back to life —continuing his legacy. 'After he passed, we learned how much he did for families, things that no words can describe. I didn’t leave the house after he died, but when the war started, I realized I needed to act and do good again.' Graucher’s father, David 'Dedi' Graucher, was a well-known singer in the ultra-Orthodox community, famous for his religious music hits and his ability to connect donors with major charitable initiatives. He was deeply involved in helping orphans and widows. He died three weeks before the October 7 massacre, and his son, who had considered following in his footsteps, suddenly saw the need for this work at an unprecedented level. Inspiring others to give Graucher, 35, lives in Jerusalem with his wife and five children. He studied at the Nehora and Derech Chochma yeshivas. He runs a VIP travel agency catering to wealthy Jewish clients in the U.S., through which he has built relationships with the upper echelons of American Jewish communities. Beyond business, he connects them to social, Zionist and volunteer initiatives in Israel. 'I have a VIP travel agency. My clients are extremely wealthy U.S. Jews traveling to Israel for vacations, family visits or events. They usually send me a WhatsApp message with their needs, and then don’t have to worry about a thing,' he explained. 'I arrange their first-class flights, transportation, hotels, attractions, private chefs, babysitters — everything they need.' Six years in the industry allowed him to form deep connections. He frequently travels to clients’ celebrations and meetings in the U.S. and hosts them when they visit Israel. 'On October 7, it was Simchat Torah. Many of my clients and acquaintances were in Israel for the holidays. After experiencing the massacre firsthand, they felt uncomfortable returning home without contributing. 'Some left me checks for $50,000 or $100,000, asking me to put the funds toward the war effort. That’s how we started — by providing equipment for soldiers, helping evacuees and addressing urgent needs.' Did this effort begin on October 7? 'No. People don’t realize that Klal Yisrael — the organization that scaled up our wartime efforts — started back in 2017. A few families banded together to support terror victims, civilians and soldiers, giving each family $10,000 and essential supplies. We also provided food baskets to the needy, medical treatments — whatever we could to help. 'Everything was done quietly, away from the cameras. Since the war started, our efforts have expanded dramatically. We’ve visited 970 bereaved families since October 7, going door to door, offering financial support and gifts to those who lost loved ones to terror and war.' Some critics on social media question why you document and publicize donations instead of keeping them private. Does this concern you? 'First, we never make donations conditional on filming or publicity. But we realized that when families agree, documenting these moments has value. 'The main goal is to show national unity. As a Haredi man visiting families from all sectors of Israeli society — especially after the divisiveness before October 7 — I wanted to demonstrate that we can put our differences aside and support one another. We must unite as one people. That’s why we started this movement on October 8.' He added, 'There’s another important aspect. Before the war, donors would sometimes contribute large sums and later say, ‘We never saw where the money went.’ By documenting and sharing, they see their contributions making an impact — bringing joy to someone, helping someone in need. That motivates them to keep donating and inspires others to give as well.' Closing the circle Inspiration can come from unexpected places. 'A few months ago, a girl preparing for her bat mitzvah saw our videos online and got an idea,' he recalled. 'She told her father she didn’t want a big party with friends and family in a hall. Instead, she wanted to donate the money and buy iPhones for soldiers.' 'A year ago, she reached out and said, ‘I want to distribute iPhones with Shai.’ We went together, handed them out and she was thrilled. Believe me, I don’t need fame. I was close to Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky, my father was famous — I don’t need the publicity.' Graucher often finds himself finding closures. 'Yonatan Azulay, the best friend of Eliya Cohen — who was recently freed from captivity — was murdered at the Nova music festival massacre. We visited his family to see if they needed anything. We were at their shiva and his mother, Linda, told an incredible story,' he recounted. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'She was widowed 18 years ago when her husband died of illness. Her brother was [Benjamin] Netanyahu’s driver and my father sent money through him to help her after she became a widow. My father was even investigated over this, which pained him deeply because he was just trying to do good. But we never knew the full story.' The bereaved mother shared that her son, Yonatan, had always wanted to donate a Torah scroll in memory of his late father. 'She told me this on the 30th day after his passing and they had a Torah scroll in their name within 48 hours,' Graucher said. 'We offered them gifts — AirPods, a laptop — but they wanted only one thing: a Torah scroll.' He recounted other emotional moments: 'We took freed hostages and their families to Ramat Aviv Mall for a private shopping experience. We closed down the stores after hours, so they had it to themselves, letting them pick out clothes and shoes.' 'We covered half a million shekels’ worth of purchases ($137,784). Our goal is to spread joy, to connect these generous American donors with Israeli society and to show how much kindness and unity exist within our people.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bjgvnyjjjg	2025-03-09T05:25:14-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/24/ryz2iI9cke/ryz2iI9cke_0_330_961_540_0_small.jpg

Settler leader meets Trump’s senior Arab and Middle Eastern affai...	Samaria Council head Yossi Dagan met Massad Boulos, Trump’s senior Middle East advisor, in Washington; Dagan presented Boulos with symbolic gifts, including wine honoring Trump’s inauguration As leaders of the settler movement await statements from the Trump administration regarding the West Bank, they have intensified efforts to promote their agenda and strengthen ties with the administration. Massad Boulos, the Lebanese-American father-in-law of President Donald Trump's daughter and one of his closest advisers, held an extended meeting with Yossi Dagan, head of the Samaria Regional Council, at Boulos’ home in Washington. Details of the meeting were first posted on Dagan’s Facebook page. The meeting was part of a series of discussions Dagan and his team are currently conducting in Washington. Their goal is to build coalitions in support of settlement activity in the West Bank and to educate and promote understanding within the Trump administration, Congress and the Senate about the importance of applying sovereignty to the West Bank now. Boulos, an American businessman of Lebanese descent, is considered one of Trump’s closest allies and serves as his senior adviser on Middle East affairs. During the meeting, Dagan presented Boulos with the official Samaria medal and a bottle of Trump Victory wine, a special edition produced by the Kabir Winery in the West Bank town of Elon Moreh to commemorate Trump’s inauguration. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Boulos expressed his gratitude, saying: 'It is a pleasure to convey my appreciation to the people of the West Bank through you. To my brothers and sisters in Israel and Lebanon, we look forward to peace and yearn for it, and with God’s help, we hope it will come soon. I deeply appreciate this gesture.' Dagan responded: 'I believe and know that the Creator has sent us to work together for the future of the Middle East and the world. Especially after October 7, we are united and will continue to work together.' Dagan also conveyed a message of appreciation to Trump. 'For everything you and your team are doing together — your policies for the security of Israel and the United States and for restoring justice in the world. In Israel, we feel toward you, and especially toward President Trump, like family. May God bless you,' Dagan said. Massad Boulos’ son, Michael, married Trump's daughter Tiffany in November 2022. During Trump’s 2024 election campaign, Michael Boulos led outreach efforts to the Arab-American community in key states such as Michigan, significantly contributing to garnering support among Arab-Americans. Following Trump’s victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Trump announced Massad Boulos’ appointment as his senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs. Following Trump’s inauguration, Dagan established a Congressional caucus in Washington to promote the West Bank. The caucus, which includes over 20 members of Congress, aims to advance Israeli sovereignty in the area. The caucus’s first initiative was a bill, introduced by Congresswoman Claudia Tenney, its chair, declaring that official U.S. documents should no longer refer to the area as the 'West Bank' but instead call it by its biblical names. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjw6q05okg	2025-03-09T01:34:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/09/ryenQ2cokg/ryenQ2cokg_0_103_1230_693_0_small.jpg

As Israel imposes blockade on Gaza, Houthis threaten another agai...	Gaza remains under Israeli blockade, prompting the Houthis to escalate threats in the Red Sea; Responding to Hamas’ request, Yemeni rebels warn of renewed naval blockades and missile fire, testing Israel and US coordination as regional tensions mount Over the past week, Houthis have shifted gears when it comes to threats against Israel, both by renewing missile fire toward Israeli territory and by resuming naval actions against both Israel and the United States. According to information received by officials in Jerusalem, Hamas asked the Houthis in Yemen to renew the maritime blockade on Israel 'as a means of applying pressure to prevent a return to fighting.' In his latest weekly speech, Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi declared the 'resumption of naval actions against Israeli vessels' unless humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza are restored within four days. Similar threats were made by senior Houthi officials last month, stating that if cease-fires in Gaza or Lebanon collapse, missile fire from Yemen would resume. This is likely a request from the terror organization, which from the start of the war aimed to unite the various fronts so that Israel's enemies in the region would act against it simultaneously. In response, Israel is preparing for the possibility that the ultimatum will indeed be carried out, implying the renewal of the Houthis’ naval blockade. The possibility of resuming missile fire from Yemen is also being considered. Israel has emphasized that there is close coordination with U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) in anticipation of such scenarios, and Israeli officials are counting on a 'harsher response' from the United States against the Houthis than what was seen during Biden's administration. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: During his first month in office, President Donald Trump designated the Houthis as a terrorist organization and imposed sanctions on senior Houthi officials. Israel, for its part, has attacked the Houthis in Yemen five times during the ongoing war. Despite the significant destruction inflicted on several of their key assets, the Houthis are now threatening a 'second round' of confrontation. The last Israeli attack in Yemen occurred on January 10, 10 days before the second Trump presidency was ushered in. The first attack, carried out in Operation Long Arm, occurred on July 20 of the previous year, followed by attacks on September 29, during Operation White City on December 19, and during Operation 'Sounds of the Vineyard' on December 26. The port of Hodeidah was targeted multiple times in these airstrikes. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r100rwp5o1g	2025-03-09T00:21:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/01/20/S1zD11rKYp/S1zD11rKYp_0_26_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Trump’s ultimatum to Hamas sparks fears of renewed war while Israel mobilizes troops and Hamas refuses to disarm amid stalled hostage negotiations; Israel increases pressure on Hamas potentially leading to a full resumption of hostilities After U.S. President Donald Trump issued a stark warning to Hamas if the terror group does not release Israeli hostages, a senior American official said Sunday, 'He [Trump] wants all the hostages released immediately. If that doesn't happen, President Trump fully supports Israel in doing whatever is necessary to eliminate Hamas and bring the hostages home.' Meanwhile, Hamas announced that a delegation led by its senior official Muhammad Darwish met Egyptian General Intelligence Service chief Hassan Rashad in Cairo to discuss the cease-fire agreement, hostage releases and displacement plans. According to Hamas, the delegation stressed the need to adhere to the agreement’s terms and called for 'immediate negotiations on the deal’s second phase, the reopening of border crossings and the unrestricted entry of aid into Gaza.' The Prime Minister’s Office announced that an Israeli delegation will travel to Doha on Monday to advance hostage negotiations, responding to an invitation from mediators Egypt and Qatar, with U.S. backing. The delegation will include senior Shin Bet official 'M.,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s political advisor Ophir Falk, hostage coordinator Gal Hirsch and officials from the IDF and Mossad. The announcement followed a security assessment led by Netanyahu amid concerns over the direct U.S.-Hamas negotiations. On Saturday, Al-Arabiya reported an agreement to extend the temporary cease-fire throughout Ramadan, but both Israel and Hamas denied the claim. Later, Saudi network Al-Hadath reported, 'Hamas has agreed in principle to extend the first phase (cease-fire and gradual hostage releases) by two months and to release live soldiers.' The report has not been officially confirmed. Israel has devised a series of escalating measures to increase pressure on Hamas, potentially leading to a full resumption of hostilities if the terror group does not return the remaining 59 hostages. The Wall Street Journal reported the measures began last week with a halt on goods and supplies entering Gaza. A source familiar with the plan said that if Hamas fails to release more hostages, Israel may escalate to renewed airstrikes and tactical raids, followed by the potential evacuation of hundreds of thousands of Gazans who returned to northern Gaza during the cease-fire. According to sources familiar with the military plan, 'Israel may ultimately re-enter Gaza with a larger force than before, aiming to seize and hold territory while eliminating Hamas remnants.' U.S. officials have similarly assessed that if Israel resumes combat operations, it will do so 'more forcefully and decisively,' aligning with Trump’s warnings. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: At present, renewed fighting appears almost inevitable — Hamas has conditioned the return of all 59 hostages on a permanent end to the war, while Israel insists that Hamas must disarm and relinquish control of Gaza, which the terror group has so far refused to do. The government maintains that there will be no commitment to ending the war as long as Hamas remains in control. On his first day as IDF chief of staff last week, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir approved offensive plans for the IDF Southern Command in preparation for a potential resumption of fighting. Hamas, meanwhile, has been preparing for renewed conflict during the cease-fire. The IDF has warned decisionmakers that any new offensive in Gaza will face constraints — not just in troop numbers but also in areas where operations could be hindered by the presence of hostages. Several IDF divisions, including reserve brigades, have been preparing for a ground assault in Gaza, supported by intensive aerial bombardments. Reports indicate that Hamas has strengthened its military readiness in recent weeks, fortifying explosive-rigged zones, redeploying thousands of terrorists in Gaza City, repositioning rocket launchers and reorganizing combat units into platoons and battalions. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjioa35jjx	2025-03-08T23:05:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/08/SkOwYVqoJe/SkOwYVqoJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

While negotiating cease-fire: Qatar demands IAEA oversight of Isr...	Doha pressures international bodies during IAEA governors meeting to enforce nuclear transparency on Israel and for Israel to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons amid escalating Middle East tensions Qatar issued an unusual statement calling for all of Israel’s nuclear facilities to be placed under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) supervision. Qatar’s Foreign Ministry on Saturday night urged for 'greater international efforts to bring all Israeli nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards,' and for Israel to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). According to the statement, Qatar’s ambassador to Austria, Jassim Yacoub Al-Hammadi — who also serves as the country's permanent representative to UN offices in Vienna — made the remarks during an IAEA Board of Governors meeting in the Austrian capital. The meeting addressed 'the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel’s nuclear capabilities.' 'The ambassador stressed the need for the international community and its institutions to uphold their obligations under UN Security Council resolutions, the UN General Assembly, the IAEA and the 1995 NPT Review Conference, which called on Israel to place all its nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards,' Qatar’s foreign ministry said. 'He noted that some of these resolutions explicitly urged Israel to join the NPT as a non-nuclear state.' Al-Hammadi also said that 'every Middle Eastern country except Israel' is a party to the NPT and has effective safeguard agreements with the IAEA. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He accused Israel of maintaining 'an aggressive policy,' citing 'growing calls for the forced displacement of the Palestinian people, increased military operations against cities and refugee camps in the West Bank, obstruction of humanitarian aid to Gaza and continued restrictions on UNRWA’s operations.' Doha also announced last week that it submitted a written memorandum to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) regarding a request for an advisory opinion based on a UN General Assembly resolution from December 19, 2024. 'The request seeks clarification on Israel’s obligations regarding UN activities, international organizations, and third-party entities,' the statement read. The memorandum affirmed Israel’s duty to allow UN and international organizations —especially UNRWA and humanitarian agencies — to operate in Israel and the 'occupied Palestinian territories.' It also called on Israel to respect and protect UN and international property, including schools, medical facilities, transportation infrastructure and water resources, as well as the personnel working in them. 'Al-Hammadi stressed the urgency for the international community and its institutions to take decisive action to compel Israel to implement international resolutions, recognize the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and statehood, restore security and stability in the Middle East and prevent further global risks,' the Qatari statement concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1jym39sjx	2025-03-08T21:58:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/29/Sykhaa4Sa/Sykhaa4Sa_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

The gang rape of an Israeli woman and India's fight against sexua...	Indian authorities confirm new details in the gang rape of an Israeli woman and a guesthouse owner in Karnataka region; Two suspects confessed, saying they were drunk during the attack, while a third suspect remains at large as investigations continue; State official: 'The horrific attack and rape of an Israeli citizen and a guesthouse owner are heinous crimes' On Saturday, Indian media widely covered the report of the gang rape of an Israeli woman and a local guesthouse owner, noting the date of the incident — International Women’s Day. The gang rape was also reported by leading global news agencies, including AP and Reuters, as well as major British outlets such as BBC, Sky News, and The Guardian. The incident occurred near the village of Sanapur in the Karnataka state. The two women were traveling with three tourists — two Americans and one Indian — who were thrown into a canal by the attackers before the women were assaulted. Two of the men were injured but managed to swim out, while the third drowned, and his body was found Saturday morning. Two suspects, aged 21 and 22, have been arrested, and a manhunt for the third suspect is ongoing. Indian media reported that two of the suspects raped the guesthouse owner, while the third raped the Israeli tourist. According to the reports, the victims — who had gone stargazing near the canal in the Hampi area — did not know each other beforehand and had met at the guesthouse. Hampi is a town in Karnataka, and some of its areas, including ancient temples, are recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Many Israelis visit the area. Crimes against women in India garnered worldwide headlines last year after a junior doctor in a public hospital was raped and murdered. That case led to massive protests by doctors and strikes in protest of inadequate security measures, but gang rape incidents have been happening in India for quite a while. In 2016, a 25-yea-old Israeli woman travelling in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, was gang raped after a car with six men in it offered her a ride. According to official Indian data, in 2022, 31,516 rape complaints were filed with the police, a 20% increase compared to 2021. However, it is estimated that the actual numbers are much higher because many rapes and other acts of violence go unreported due to a lack of trust in the police and the social stigma still often attached to sexually assaulted women. Siddaramaiah, the chief minister of Karnataka, who effectively leads the state, addressed the rape in Hampi, saying: 'The horrific attack and rape of an Israeli citizen and a guesthouse owner are heinous crimes. As soon as the incident was reported, I instructed the police to take immediate action, conduct a thorough investigation, and quickly apprehend the culprits. The police have already arrested two suspects and are continuing the investigation. Our government is committed to ensuring the safety of every individual, including tourists. We will take all necessary measures to prevent such incidents from recurring.' Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not refer to the case directly, but in his speech yesterday on International Women’s Day, he emphasized the importance his government places on protecting women. 'When a daughter comes home late, her parents ask questions. But they do not ask similar questions when a son comes home late. Over the past decade, we have prioritized women's safety and security. To stop crimes against women, we have changed laws and established the death penalty for heinous acts like rape,' he said. The full and disturbing testimony of the guesthouse owner, who was raped and filed a complaint with the police, was revealed Saturday. This is how she described the incident: 'After dinner, we decided to go stargazing. We rode scooters to the banks of the Tungabhadra canal near Sanapur Lake. While we were stargazing and playing the guitar, around 10:30 p.m., three men on a motorcycle approached us and asked for fuel.' She told them there was no nearby gas station and that they could find fuel in Sanapur. According to her testimony, one of the men suddenly demanded 100 rupees (less than $2): 'They didn’t know us, so I told them I didn’t have any money. But they kept demanding and demanding until one of the male tourists gave them 20 rupees.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to her, when the tourists refused to give them more money, the suspects began arguing with them and threatening them with stones. Two of the men attacked and raped the women, while the third pushed the male tourists into the canal and hit them with stones. 'I was bleeding heavily. Two of the attackers joined forces and dragged me to the side of the canal. One of them strangled me and removed my clothes. One after another, they beat me and raped me.' She recounted that the attackers stole her bag and fled with two mobile phones and 9,500 rupees. One of the suspects dragged the Israeli tourist and raped her. 'When we screamed and cried, the three fled on their motorcycle,' said the guesthouse owner. Two of the suspects have been arrested and are charged with gang rape, extortion, and attempted murder. According to the police, the two detainees confessed to the rape and said they had consumed alcohol at a bar before the incident. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk00fas9oyg	2025-03-08T21:42:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/09/Syl9CzSqsJg/Syl9CzSqsJg_147_91_654_368_0_small.jpg

Man who climbed London's Big Ben to support Palestinians comes do...	He climbed barefoot carrying a Palestinian flag and refused to come down, even after rescuers went up with a crane and tried to convince him; He filmed himself and posted a video on Instagram: 'stop weapons from being sent to the terrorist state of Israel'; Eyewitnesses were amazed, saying he looked 'like Spiderman' A man who scaled the lower sections of Big Ben's Elizabeth Tower at London's Palace of Westminster early on Saturday has came down after 16 hours and was subsequently arrested, the British police said on Sunday. He was waving a Palestinian flag and shouted 'free Palestine,' according to British media. 'We worked with other agencies including the London Fire Brigade and deployed specialist officers to bring this incident to a close as quickly as possible while minimizing risk to life,' a Metropolitan Police spokesperson said. Emergency crews had gone up in a crane to negotiate with the man, and he came down after earlier telling negotiators he would come down 'on his own terms', according to a Sky News report. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police earlier said they were alerted to the incident at Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) at 7:24 local time. Emergency services closed Westminster Bridge on Saturday morning in response to the incident, and parliamentary tours were also cancelled, Sky News had reported. All roads have been reopened following the man's arrest, the police added. According to the Daily Mail, the protest triggered a 'massive emergency response,' with rescue teams deploying a crane to bring the man down safely. Videos filmed by onlookers captured the protester shouting, 'I’m not going anywhere' and calling to 'free Palestine.' Witness Luke Whelan told the Daily Mail, 'I was cycling to work when I saw him climbing up Big Ben. It looked like he was on a video call or livestreaming. He seemed pretty calm up there, like Spider-Man.' The protester shared videos on Instagram from his perspective on the tower, in one of which he also documented the moments when he climbed the fence outside the tower and then onto the tower itself. In another video, he documented the rescuers who were hoisted up to him in a crane in an attempt to convince him to come down. 'At some point you're going to have to come down, how long do you think you're going to be up there?' one of them is heard telling him, but he refused to come down. In the videos, he is also seen bleeding from his feet. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In another video posted by the man, he is heard saying: 'Democracy is dead, when people are sent to prison for nonviolent civil disobedience protests, when climate activists get three to four years in prison, when activists for Palestine are imprisoned for doing what the government should do, stop weapons from being sent to the terrorist state of Israel.' From one of the videos he uploaded, it is clear that he had intended to remain on the tower for three and a half days. Sky News reported that dozens of protesters gathered in the area to demonstrate in support of the man who climbed the tower, and one of them waved a sign against the BBC, to protest that a documentary about Gaza which was removed from the British Broadcasting Corporation's website for not following standard journalistic practice: 'Labor, Conservatives, BBC, you present Russia's crimes but hide Israel's...

Millions in USAID funds sent to Hamas and terror groups, U.S. con...	Middle East Forum head Gregg Ramon reveals in interview with Ynetnews that U.S. taxpayer money was being funneled to organizations with ties to Hamas, Al-Qaida and other terror groups; following his testimony, testimony, congressional lawmakers have begun pushing for immediate action A U.S. congressional hearing last week revealed that U.S. government aid funds had been directed to organizations with ties to Hamas and other designated terrorist groups, according to testimony presented by Gregg Raman, executive director of the Middle East Forum who recently talked with Ynet. 'The DOGE Committee is delivering on government efficiency and has been peeling back the onion when it comes to many instances of fraud, waste and abuse in U.S. budgetary spending,' Roman said. 'Last week's hearing specifically focused on how that fraud led to national security implications for the U.S. government and its allies, like Israel.' According to Roman, the issue involves two key areas. 'There's money that went to Hamas-affiliated organizations and areas under Hamas control after October 7,' he said. 'But the second set of data goes back 15 years to the Obama administration. 'USAID, along with other elements of the State Department and the U.S. government, funded radical organizations with over $122 million going to groups that have direct ties to Al-Qaida and other organizations that are on the U.S. list of designated terrorist groups.' The findings suggest U.S. taxpayer money has been funneled to terrorist groups in Somalia and Gaza as well. 'It would be like the U.S. government subsidizing Nazi Germany with the Marshall Plan before Hitler fell during World War II,' Roman said. 'It's unconscionable and must be dealt with immediately, which is why the hearing was held.' Roman described to Ynetnews years of attempts to obtain information through legal channels, facing resistance from multiple administrations. 'We filed Freedom of Information Act requests with the U.S. government, but in some instances, we're still facing delays — even though the Trump administration promised to release the information as soon as possible.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We've also filed six lawsuits against the U.S. government to obtain this data. Gradually, month by month, year by year, we managed to uncover it,' he added. He also recalled similar challenges during his time as a noncommissioned officer in Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT). 'We sought answers about U.S. administrations subsidizing terror-linked groups but they refused to explain and even applied political pressure to force allies to allow the funds to go through,' he said. Following Roman’s testimony, congressional lawmakers have begun pushing for immediate action. 'It’s prompted members of the executive branch and Congress to seek immediate action — not just to stop this kind of funding, but also to hold those responsible accountable, potentially through civil actions and even criminal indictments,' he said. He added that discussions are underway to place organizations that received the funds on a 'do-not-support' list. 'This would be enforced through secondary sanctions under U.S. law,' he said. Roman also noted that efforts are being made to prevent future funding of terror-linked organizations. 'I think lawmakers are working to codify it into U.S. law so that it’s not just an administrative action, but something permanent,' he said. The U.S. government has yet to respond publicly to the findings presented at the hearing. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1yecbioke	2025-03-08T14:04:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/03/ByfsX3R001x/ByfsX3R001x_0_88_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Israeli delegation to leave for cease-fire talks in Qatar as Hama...	Israel will send a delegation to Doha on Monday to advance hostage release talks, following an invitation from Egypt and Qatar, with U.S. support; This follows rising tensions over U.S.-Hamas talks, which Israel fears are bypassing it; Hamas, meanwhile, demands new terms for any cease-fire extension, including the release of hundreds of prisoners, including lifers; U.S. talks with Hamas have further strained relations, with Israel seeking veto rights over prisoner releases. Israel announced Saturday that it will dispatch a delegation to Doha on Monday to advance negotiations for the release of hostages held in Gaza. The Prime Minister’s Office stated that the decision follows an invitation from mediators Egypt and Qatar, with U.S. backing. The announcement came after a security consultation led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and amid growing concerns in Israel over direct U.S.-Hamas talks. The Israeli delegation will include a senior Shin Bet official, Netanyahu’s political advisor Ophir Falk, hostage and missing persons coordinator Gal Hirsch, and representatives from the IDF and Mossad. A political source said the delegation would push forward the framework proposed by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. Earlier Saturday, Al-Arabiya reported that Israel and Hamas had agreed to extend the temporary cease-fire throughout Ramadan — claims denied by both parties. Meanwhile, Saudi network Al-Hadath reported that Hamas had agreed in principle to extend the first phase of the cease-fire by two months, with a phased release of hostages, including Israeli soldiers. Unnamed sources told Al-Hadath that Hamas had shown flexibility in negotiations with its expanded delegation in Cairo. 'The progress in talks with Hamas led Israel to send its own delegation on Monday,' a source said, though no official confirmation has been issued. Adam Boehler, President Donald Trump’s hostages envoy, has continued discussions with Hamas over the weekend, exploring modifications to Witkoff’s proposed framework. Instead of releasing all hostages in two phases, current talks reportedly focus on freeing a smaller number while extending the cease-fire until the end of Ramadan and Passover. According to Gaza-based journalist Tamer Almisshal, considered a Hamas mouthpiece, four direct meetings took place this week between the U.S. and Hamas. He claimed that U.S. officials sought a partial deal for the release of one Israeli American soldier and the bodies of four other Israelis with U.S. citizenship. Hamas allegedly agreed to the release in exchange for freeing of hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli prisons. The U.S. reportedly offered to release 250 prisoners, including 100 serving life sentences. Israel sought veto rights over 50 names, while Hamas insisted on limiting it to 10. However, after the fourth meeting, the U.S. withdrew from talks, with Trump reportedly demanding hostage releases without concessions. One report suggests the U.S. is now negotiating a deal to secure the release of 10 hostages in exchange for a 60-day cease-fire. The Trump administration is prioritizing the release of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, as well as American citizens confirmed dead, as part of a broader deal. Officials say Trump was deeply shaken by his recent meeting with freed hostages and has ordered his team to secure their release. Israel fears U.S.-Hamas talks are happening behind Its back While Israel is receiving updates from Washington, officials worry that the direct U.S.-Hamas negotiations are sidelining Jerusalem. Israeli sources told Al-Hadath that these talks have not yet produced results, but officials close to the Trump administration believe otherwise. Israeli officials who recently spoke with White House advisors were struck by their confidence that direct talks with Hamas could yield progress. They noted that Hamas’ statement about 'positive indications for advancing Phase II' of a deal aligns with U.S. assessments, contradicting Israeli claims that no significant progress has been made. A diplomatic rift deepened following reports that Israeli Minister Ron Dermer 'erupted in fury' at Boehler during a tense phone call after Boehler met Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya in Qatar. While Boehler assured him that discussions were preliminary and that no deal would be signed without Israeli approval, the conversation heightened tensions between Washington and Jerusalem. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: A leak revealing Boehler’s meeting led to speculation that Israel was behind it, further straining trust between the two governments. A senior U.S. official acknowledged that 'Israel doesn’t like that we’re speaking directly with Hamas,' but stressed that Israel was informed. The talks have been ongoing for over three weeks. Israeli sources who spoke with senior White House officials believe that resolving the hostage crisis is key to Trump’s broader plan to expand the Abraham Accords. 'They won’t let Netanyahu derail their agenda,' one official said. 'This is an administration that steamrolls obstacles to get what it wants. If they see Bibi as a roadblock, they’ll go after him. Trump is planning a trip to Saudi Arabia in the next six weeks — he won’t go if the hostage issue isn’t resolved. The White House’s mindset is that Trump simply doesn’t lose, and he won’t let anyone put him in that position.' Hamas statement: No cease-fire extension without new terms A Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo this weekend following U.S. negotiations and an American proposal reportedly submitted to the group. Washington has kept Israel informed of these developments. However, a senior Israeli source said U.S. envoy Witkoff is unlikely to travel to the region unless negotiations reach a more advanced stage. Meanwhile, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told Al Jazeera that discussions with mediators continue regarding Phase II of the negotiations. 'We have set three conditions: prisoner exchanges, a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and a commitment not to resume the war,' he stated. Qassem urged Israel to 'demonstrate seriousness' to mediators, emphasizing that Hamas rejects extending the current cease-fire and seeks a new framework for further hostage exchanges. 'We have no issue engaging with U.S. representatives because we understand the pressure they exert on Israel,' he said. 'We do not oppose the release of Israeli prisoners with American citizenship, but only as part of a comprehensive agreement.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1h8cv9ikx	2025-03-08T13:30:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/B1tH0OPjyx/B1tH0OPjyx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

We came to stargaze - then they came, beat us, and raped me one ...	Guesthouse owner recounts night out with an Israeli tourist and three men near a canal: 'As we played guitar, three men arrived, demanded money, and pushed the men into the water. Then one dragged me, choked me, and tore off my clothes.' One man drowned, two suspects were arrested, and a third remains at large. Following reports on Saturday that an Israeli tourist and a local guesthouse owner were raped by three men in India, the full harrowing testimony of the guesthouse owner has now been revealed. The attack occurred on Friday night near the village of Sanapur in Karnataka. The two women were with three tourists —two Americans and an Indian — when the assailants threw the men into a canal before assaulting them. Two of the men managed to swim to safety with injuries, while the third drowned. His body was recovered Saturday morning. The guesthouse owner, who filed a police complaint, described the ordeal. 'After dinner, we decided to go stargazing. We rode scooters to the banks of the Tungabhadra canal near Sanapur Lake. Around 10:30 p.m., while we were watching the stars and playing the guitar, three men on a motorcycle approached us and asked for fuel,' she described. She told them there was no gas station nearby and suggested they find fuel in Sanapur. According to her, one of the men suddenly demanded 100 rupees. 'They didn’t know us, so I told them I had no money. But they kept insisting, until one of the male tourists gave them 20 rupees.' When the tourists refused to give more, the suspects became aggressive, arguing and threatening them with stones. 'Two of them attacked and raped us, while the third pushed the men into the canal and hit me with stones,' she testified. 'I was bleeding heavily. Two of the attackers dragged me to the side of the canal. One of them choked me and tore off my clothes. One after another, they beat and raped me.' She said the assailants stole her bag, two mobile phones, and 9,500 rupees before fleeing. One of the suspects also dragged the Israeli tourist and raped her. 'When we screamed and cried, the three fled on their motorcycle,' she added. Local police reported that two suspects, both 22, have been arrested, while a third is still being hunted. 'He will be caught soon,' a police representative stated. The suspects face charges of gang rape, extortion, and attempted murder. According to police, the two arrested men admitted to the rape and said they had been drinking at a bar before the attack. Both women were hospitalized for medical examinations. Israel’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that 'The Israeli consulate in Bangalore and the Department for Israelis Abroad are aware of the case and are handling it.' Karnataka’s Chief Minister Siddaramaiah condemned the attack. 'The horrific assault and rape of an Israeli citizen and a guesthouse owner is a despicable crime. As soon as the incident was reported, I instructed the police to take immediate action, conduct a thorough investigation, and swiftly apprehend the culprits. Two have already been arrested, and the investigation continues. Our government is committed to ensuring the safety of all individuals, including tourists. We will take every necessary measure to prevent such incidents from happening again,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rybyigqjyg	2025-03-08T10:37:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/08/Bk00XNhKsJl/Bk00XNhKsJl_1_0_1200_675_0_small.jpg

Massacre of Alawites continues in Syria with hundreds more killed...	More than 500 minority Alawite civilians have been killed in clashes between Syria’s new regime and Assad loyalists in Latakia and Tartus; Fighting continues as Hezbollah denies aiding 'remnants of Assad’s forces'; . President al-Julani accused Assad loyalists of trying to destabilize and 'test the new Syria' Fighting continues in Syria’s coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus following massacres in which hundreds of Alawite civilians were killed. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported Saturday evening that, since Thursday, more than 500 Alawites have been slaughtered amid clashes between security forces aligned with the new regime and loyalists of ousted dictator Bashar Assad. The organization estimates that at least 745 people have been killed so far, including 523 Alawite civilians, while the rest were combatants from both sides. Since Saturday morning, Syrian social media has been flooded with images of intense battles between regime-aligned security forces and armed groups referred to by Syrian media as 'remnants of the Assad regime.' Some reports suggest that supporters of the deposed Alawite leader have been receiving external assistance, possibly from exiled elements who fled Syria. Speculation about external support prompted Hezbollah, a longtime ally of Assad, to issue a statement denying any involvement in the events. 'Certain parties are attempting to link Hezbollah to the developments in Syria and accuse it of taking sides in the ongoing conflict. Hezbollah categorically denies these baseless allegations and calls on the media to report accurately and avoid misleading campaigns serving political agendas,' the terror organization said in a statement. Meanwhile, opposition-affiliated Arab media outlets report additional massacres allegedly carried out by the current regime. The Hezbollah-linked Al-Mayadeen network reported on two massacres in the villages of Al-Qabu and Ain al-Arus in Latakia’s countryside. The director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights described the situation as a 'disaster,' stating that the killings of Alawites involve foreign elements. Syria’s state-run news agency reported that internal security forces in Latakia had seized large stockpiles of ammunition belonging to 'remnants of the old regime.' Syrian TV network SyriaTV reported that pro-Assad militants surrendered to security forces following clashes in the city of Jableh. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Images of security forces deploying across various areas were widely circulated, with official sources claiming their mission was to 'restore security and stability and protect civilians.' Other reports suggested that 'remnants of the Assad regime' and their families had fled to the Russian-run Hmeimim Air Base. Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Muhammad al-Julani, vowed Friday that security forces would continue pursuing 'remnants of the previous regime' to bring them to justice, accusing them of trying to destabilize the country. 'They sought to test the new Syria — a country they no longer recognize,' he declared. However, an Alawite source told Ynet that the community has no ties to Assad’s former regime. 'This is not some organized rebellion, as regime-affiliated media claim. There is no Iranian or Russian backing, and these are not Assad loyalists,' he said. 'People simply can’t endure the daily humiliation and terror any longer, and they rose up to defend their dignity.' Arab nations have condemned the ongoing unrest in Syria while expressing support for the new government’s efforts to restore order. The United Arab Emirates joined in the condemnations Saturday, with its Foreign Ministry denouncing 'attacks against Syrian security forces' and affirming 'support for Syria’s stability, sovereignty over all its territories, and efforts to achieve security, peace, and stability.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkqwf119syg	2025-03-08T09:15:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/08/H1fbm8vYjJx/H1fbm8vYjJx_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Gaza Not for Sale': Pro-Palestinian graffiti spray-painted at Tr...	A pro-Palestinian group spray-painted graffiti on one of Trump's golf courses in Scotland, including on the putting green, and the clubhouse walls were covered in slogans against the US president; The group objects to Trump treating Gaza like his personal property and says: 'we have shown him that his own property is not safe from acts of resistance' Pro-Palestinian activists vandalized one of U.S. President Donald Trump’s golf resorts in Scotland in response to his proposal to empty the Gaza Strip of its Palestinian population. The group Palestine Action targeted Trump’s Turnberry golf course and hotel in southwest Scotland overnight, painting 'Gaza Is Not For Sale' in giant letters on the lawn and using red spray paint on the club house’s exterior wall. Palestine Action said it 'rejects Donald Trump’s treatment of Gaza as though it were his property to dispose of as he likes.' 'To make that clear, we have shown him that his own property is not safe from acts of resistance,' it said in a statement. Police Scotland said it received a report of damage to the golf course in the early hours of Saturday, and that inquiries are ongoing. Trump Turnberry called the activism a 'childish, criminal act' and said it will ensure it does not affect its business. The future of Gaza is uncertain as the first phase of a cease-fire that paused the 15-month war between Israel and Hamas ended with no clarity on what would come next because the agreement’s second phase has not yet been hammered out. Trump has called for Gaza’s population to be resettled elsewhere permanently so that the United States can take over the territory and develop it for others. Palestinians have roundly rejected calls to leave.

Are Trump’s policies a sign of the Messiah? Some religious leader...	During a visit to the White House last week, former hostage Omer Shem Tov told Trump that he was 'sent by God' to save them Some religious Jewish and Christian groups believe the Messiah's arrival—whether for the first or second time—could be imminent. In their view, God has set the stage by returning Donald Trump to the White House. The president's recent actions—whether appointing Pastor Paula White, a staunchly pro-Israel Christian, to lead his new faith office in the West Wing, telling Israel to 'let hell break loose' on Hamas and destroy the enemy, or likely preparing to announce that Israel can enact sovereignty over Judea and Samaria (also known as the West Bank)—have convinced some that their beliefs are correct. During a visit to the White House last week, former hostage Omer Shem Tov told Trump that he was 'sent by God' to save them. 'Purim is where God orchestrates all these natural and political events in order to save Israel,' explained Rabbi Tuly Weisz, founder and CEO of Israel365. 'And God places Esther in the palace 'for such a time as this.'' Speaking on the ILTV News Podcast, Weisz said, 'A lot of people said that God placed Trump in the White House,' but now they are starting to believe it. He pointed to Maimonides' teachings, which outlined three key events that would signal the coming of the Messiah. The first, he explained, is the destruction of Amalek, which many—including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after October 7—equate with modern-day Hamas. The second is a religious revival among the Jewish people. Some American Jews believe they see this happening in a growing 'surge' of interest in religious involvement, while in Israel, it is reflected in the rise of the religious right. According to Weisz, the final stage is the rebuilding of the Temple on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. 'Building the Temple would be total victory in this war,' he said, noting that Hamas called the October 7 attack the 'Al-Aqsa Flood,' a direct reference to the Temple Mount. 'God willing, we will celebrate a joyous Purim with the release of all our hostages,' Weisz continued. 'And we will have that Third Temple we have prayed for 1,000 years. It will be thanks to Donald Trump and to all the Jews who are finally saying, 'Enough of this nonsense—we are going to take action.'' Watch these previous podcasts: Jewish Power at the Polls: Inside the Zionist Election Iran’s Weakness Won’t Last—Should Israel Act Now? The Secret Behind Israel’s Dominance in AI Innovation Through his organization Israel365—and a new initiative called Israel365 Action—Weisz has been at the forefront of efforts to promote Israeli sovereignty among Jewish and Christian supporters. Last year, in partnership with several other organizations, Israel365 pushed for a resolution at the National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) convention, urging Christian media to stop referring to Judea and Samaria as the 'West Bank' and instead use its biblical name. This year, NRB took it a step further. With backing from Israel365 and similar groups, it signed a resolution supporting Israeli sovereignty in these areas. The movement has also gained traction beyond NRB. At the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), similar pro-sovereignty statements were embraced. And just last week in Jerusalem, a group calling itself the Christian Conference of Presidents promoted the same agenda. However, Israel365 and its advocacy arm, Israel365 Action, have not been without controversy. Last week, the group honored MAGA (Make America Great Again) leader Steve Bannon at an event in Texas. Bannon has been accused of antisemitism, and most recently, he was criticized for making a gesture that resembled a Nazi salute. Despite this, Israel365 Executive Director Pesach Wolicki, who joined Weisz on the ILTV News Podcast, defended Bannon, calling him 'unapologetically pro-Israel.' He argued that Bannon plays a key role in convincing members of the MAGA movement—some of whom are skeptical of Israel—that the Jewish state is a crucial ally. 'Bannon said that attacks against Israel are an attack on Judeo-Christian Western civilization,' Wolicki told ILTV. He noted that Bannon broadcasts four hours daily and listens to much of his content. 'I've never heard him say anything antisemitic,' Wolicki claimed. 'He actually gets attacked by the anti-Israel wing of the MAGA movement for being too pro-Israel.' According to Wolicki, Bannon is working to reframe the way MAGA supporters view Israel. Rather than seeing it purely as a geopolitical issue tied to military aid, Bannon wants them to recognize it as part of a more significant ideological and global conflict. Weisz echoed this perspective. He attended the Texas event and said Bannon received a standing ovation for his pro-Israel remarks. Wolicki has fully embedded himself in the MAGA movement. In December, he attended AmericaFest, the largest MAGA event of the year. He said he was likely the only person there wearing a yarmulke. He also remains in regular conversation with Bannon. His reason? Wolicki believes the movement could quickly turn against Israel, influenced by rising voices like Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson, both of whom have made antisemitic and anti-Israel statements and have Trump's ear. 'If the movement were a fully pro-Israel movement and didn't have any problematic voices in it, then there wouldn't be such a sense of urgency to get involved with them,' Wolicki said on the podcast. Israel365 Action is running a slate in the upcoming World Zionist Congress elections. Weisz said one of the platform's main goals is to push for sovereignty among Jewish community members. The election is only open to Jewish voters. Established by Theodor Herzl in 1897, the World Zionist Congress and its representatives from Jewish communities worldwide allocate $1 billion annually to Jewish causes. They also oversee Israel's key national institutions, including the World Zionist Organization, which carries out the Congress's vision; the Jewish Agency, which plays a central role in Jewish immigration to Israel; and the Jewish National Fund, which owns 13% of Israel's land. 'We unapologetically stand for Judea and Samaria. We want stronger relationships between Jews and Christians, and we want new leadership,' Weisz said. He believes there must be 'new leadership' in the Jewish world because, in his view, a Palestinian state would pose an existential threat to Israel. He argued that too many Jewish leaders, especially on the liberal left, fail to understand this. Israel365 Action has faced criticism, with some accusing it of being a covert Christian organization or of recruiting Christians to vote in the election. In December, former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman distanced himself from the slate amid allegations that Israel365 Action had a hidden Christian agenda. At the time, the group was known as the One Jewish State slate—named after Friedman's book advocating sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. The organization denied the accusations and later changed its name to Israel365 Action. But Weisz pushed back against the claims. 'There is nothing secret about our work in the Christian community. We're very proud to have taken that leadership position,' he said. He emphasized that the slate's website clearly states—'many times in bold letters'—that only Jews can vote and that the movement is for Jews. Separate efforts, he added, exist for Christians. Wolicki echoed this point. 'We're not trying to slip some Christians in the back door,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1esnx5okx	2025-03-08T08:01:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/Hkbce035Jl/Hkbce035Jl_0_76_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Hamas cites ‘positive indicators’ in cease-fire talks	Terror group spokesman says mediation efforts by Egypt and Qatar were ongoing, aimed at completing implementation of agreement and initiating talks on next phase A day after releasing a video of Israeli hostage Matan Angrest, who has been held in Gaza for 519 days, Hamas said on Saturday there were 'positive indications' regarding negotiations for the second phase of a potential deal. Hamas spokesman Abdel Latif al-Qanoua stated that mediation efforts by Egypt and Qatar were continuing in an attempt to finalize the implementation of a ceasefire agreement and initiate talks on the next phase. 'The signs are positive,' he said. Al-Qanoua added that Hamas was prepared to engage in negotiations to advance the second phase of the deal 'to achieve the demands of our people' and called for increased efforts to deliver aid to Gaza and lift what he referred to as the blockade on the enclave. According to his statement, a Hamas delegation currently in Cairo has been discussing ways to push forward negotiations, pressure Israel to engage in talks, and establish mechanisms for implementing decisions from the recent Arab summit. The delegation’s visit to Cairo follows discussions with the Trump administration and reports of a U.S. proposal being presented to the terror group. The United States has reportedly updated Israel on its contacts with Hamas. On Friday, an Israeli official downplayed expectations of an imminent breakthrough, saying that U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, was unlikely to visit the region soon. 'He will only come if there are loose ends to finalize. No progress is known at this stage,' the official said. The source added that direct U.S.-Hamas communication was 'a bonus without a deal,' emphasizing that Washington’s priority was securing the release of American citizens held in Gaza. 'If they succeed—great, let them be freed,' the official said. Israeli officials hope that beyond Trump’s threats against Hamas, the delay in humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza will also pressure the group into releasing hostages. 'As long as Hamas refuses, we will continue imposing sanctions and restrictions,' the official said. 'We want to exhaust every possibility of bringing back as many hostages as possible before resuming combat—because once the fighting resumes, things will spiral out of control.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byloorko1g	2025-03-08T05:59:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/HJPtKnEYye/HJPtKnEYye_0_255_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

According to reports, the two women were hospitalized and examined at a government medical facility. Police stated that the two arrested suspects confessed to the rape and admitted to drinking alcohol at a bar before the attack. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjoqynyjkg	2025-03-08T03:40:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/08/BJgkY73KoJx/BJgkY73KoJx_0_39_720_406_0_small.jpg

European ministers' endorsment follows emergency meeting of Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Jeddah, where 57-member body formally endorsed proposal and urged international donors to provide financial support The foreign ministers of France, Germany, Italy, and Britain have thrown their support behind an Arab-backed $53 billion plan to rebuild Gaza, emphasizing that the initiative would improve living conditions for Palestinians while ensuring they remain in their homeland. The plan, drafted by Egypt and approved by Arab leaders earlier this month, envisions Gaza’s reconstruction under the administration of the Palestinian Authority. It stands in direct opposition to U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to take over the coastal territory and relocate its residents to Egypt or Jordan—an idea that has drawn widespread condemnation. In a joint statement issued Saturday, the European ministers called the Arab-backed initiative 'a realistic path' to rebuilding Gaza, saying it could bring 'swift and sustainable improvement' to the enclave. Their backing follows an emergency meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where the 57-member body formally endorsed the plan and urged international donors to provide financial support.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty welcomed the OIC’s endorsement, saying Cairo would now seek broader international support, including from the European Union, Japan, Russia, and China. However, both the U.S. and Israel have already rejected the plan. While a U.S. State Department spokesperson said it 'does not meet expectations,' Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, described it as a 'good-faith first step from the Egyptians.' The Arab-backed initiative has united regional players against any forced displacement of Palestinians, with Egypt leading efforts to rally global support for its vision of Gaza’s reconstruction. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1de5jfi1g	2025-03-08T02:39:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/S1yXLQDokg/S1yXLQDokg_2_0_2999_1688_0_small.jpg

The barefoot protester prompts witnesses to call local authorities, leading to a major police response A pro-Palestinian protestor climbed Elizabeth Tower, home to London’s iconic Big Ben clock, on Saturday, gripping a Palestinian flag as stunned passersby looked on. The barefoot protester prompted witnesses to call local authorities, leading to a major police response. Multiple police units arrived at the scene, blocking off the area as crowds gathered to watch the unusual incident. According to the Daily Mail, the protest triggered a 'massive emergency response,' with rescue teams deploying a crane to bring the man down safely. A police spokesperson said authorities received the first report at 7:24 am local time and were working to bring the situation to a 'safe conclusion' with assistance from London’s fire and rescue services.

Israeli professor resigns from Columbia: 'It was bullsh*t; red li...	Prof. Avi Friedman endured much at Columbia—engaging with anti-Israel protesters, defending free speech, and insisting on need for pro-Zionist voice on campus; but appointment of pro-Hamas professor to teach Zionism course was breaking point Shortly before former President Donald Trump revoked $400 million in federal grants to Columbia University, Israeli-American professor Avi Friedman had already made his decision to leave. His departure, however, was not due to the pro-Palestinian protests that have engulfed the campus since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, nor was it a response to student-led building takeovers or even the removal of Israeli professor Shai Davidai from campus. For Friedman, a professor of financial economics at Columbia Business School, the breaking point came when the university appointed Professor Joseph Massad—who has described Zionism as a 'colonialist movement' and Israel as an 'apartheid state'—to teach a new course on Zionism. 'A lost generation' on campus Friedman, 61, did not shy away from engaging with student demonstrators. He recalled visiting their encampment on campus last April—an early catalyst for the wave of anti-Israel protests that has since spread to universities across the United States. 'I saw a group of lost kids,' he said. Hoping to better understand their perspective, Friedman removed his kippah and approached them. 'I asked one of them why she was there, and she told me something I’ll never forget: ‘We are holding space for Gaza.’ What does that even mean? You're not a physics student—what does ‘holding space’ mean?' While Friedman described the student protests as 'orderly and peaceful,' he noted that the real hostility came from outside agitators. 'On Broadway, it was a different story. That was a real protest—aggressive, militant. That’s where you heard ‘From the river to the sea’ and ‘Global Intifada.’' Despite the rising tensions, Friedman said he believed in upholding free speech. 'This is America. I hate what they’re saying, but they have the right to say it—as long as it doesn’t turn into violence.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: However, he was critical of Columbia’s administration for what he viewed as weak leadership. 'They set deadlines for clearing the encampments and then did nothing when those deadlines passed. That sent a clear message that there are no consequences for anything,' he said. Hamas and Zionism The final straw for Friedman came in December, when the university announced Massad’s new course on Zionism. Massad, a Palestinian-born professor of Middle Eastern studies at Columbia since the 1990s, has long been a vocal critic of Israel. His articles and speeches have sparked backlash from Jewish organizations, members of Congress, and fellow academics—especially after he praised Hamas' October 7 attack as 'remarkable' and 'a stunning victory over Zionism.' Despite public outcry, Columbia defended the decision to offer the course, citing academic freedom. 'His class is limited to 60 students and is not a required course,' the university stated in December, acknowledging that Massad’s remarks had 'caused pain' but reaffirming its commitment to free expression. Friedman was unconvinced. 'This wasn’t just Columbia reacting to events; this was an active decision to promote an anti-Zionist narrative,' he said. 'If a professor said the U.S. shouldn’t exist, would you let them teach American history? Would you let Meir Kahane teach a course on Palestinian self-determination?' He dismissed the university’s response as 'nonsense.' 'They kept telling me, ‘We are committed to academic freedom.’ But if Massad had made these comments about any other minority group, he’d have been fired in a minute. No question.' A wider battle over campus antisemitism Friedman’s resignation comes amid a broader reckoning over antisemitism on U.S. college campuses. Columbia has been at the center of this debate, with lawsuits, congressional scrutiny, and donor backlash intensifying in recent months. While Friedman is skeptical that his resignation will bring significant change, he sees growing pressure on universities to address antisemitism. 'Trump promised action, and I’m actually surprised he’s following through,' he said, referring to federal funding cuts and legal measures being pursued against universities accused of tolerating antisemitism. 'Right now, I’m cautiously optimistic,' he added. 'There’s movement—donors are pulling out, applications are declining, and it’s becoming harder for Columbia to recruit top talent. But this is a historic institution that has weathered worse. Will it change? How long will it take? Who knows. But at least there’s finally some pushback.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkgwvkkojg	2025-03-08T00:12:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/04/HJxXEvoVoJg/HJxXEvoVoJg_0_0_600_451_0_small.jpg

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol left a detention centre in Seoul on Saturday, after prosecutors decided not to appeal a court decision to cancel the arrest warrant of the impeached leader. Yoon remains suspended from his duties and under insurrection charges over his short-lived martial law imposition on December 3. The criminal case is separate from his impeachment trial, in which the Constitutional Court is expected to decide in coming days whether to reinstate him or remove him from office. The Seoul Central District Court cancelled Yoon's arrest warrant on Friday, citing the timing of his indictment and 'questions about the legality' of the investigation process. Yoon, the first South Korean president to be arrested while in office, has been in custody since January 15. On Saturday, Some 38,000 Yoon supporters rallied in Seoul, while 1,500 people demonstrated against him, Yonhap news agency reported, citing unofficial police estimates.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1pwwtkjkx	2025-03-08T00:00:06-08:00	
Hundreds of Alawite civilans executed in Syria: 'They killed ever...	Monitoring groups say at least 311 killed since Thursday; bloodshed began following ambush of government forces by what Damascus described as 'Assad loyalist gunmen' in country's Latakia province At least 311 Alawite civilians have been killed in Syria over the past two days in what appears to be a series of retaliatory attacks by the country’s new government and allied forces, according to activists and monitoring groups. The violence underscores Syria’s ongoing instability, three months after the overthrow of former president Bashar al-Assad. The bloodshed began Thursday when gunmen, identified by the new regime as loyalists of Assad’s ousted government, ambushed government forces near the coastal city of Jableh in Syria’s Latakia province. The area, home to a predominantly Alawite population that makes up about 9% of Syria’s citizens, was a stronghold of the previous ruling elite before Assad’s removal. Former regime loyalists, including ex-military personnel, remain active in Syria’s coastal areas and are suspected of carrying out recent attacks against the country’s new security forces. The ambush killed at least 50 members of the new government’s forces. In response, pro-government fighters stormed the villages of Shar, Mukhtariya, and Al-Fakh, killing civilians in apparent revenge attacks. 'They killed every man they saw,' said Rami Abdul Rahman, director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The group reported that women were spared in the attacks. Pro-government demonstrations were held in regime strongholds in Damascus and Aleppo, where supporters waved the flag of Syria’s new leadership. The violence has raised concerns that Syria could descend into further chaos. A source in Iraq’s pro-Iranian militias told the Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese news network Al-Akhbar that the situation marked 'the beginning of chaos.' 'The struggle for influence—Turkey’s attempts to assert control on one side, versus U.S. and Israeli-backed efforts on the other—will lead Syria into difficult times and endless challenges,' the source said. He denied any Iranian involvement in the violence but warned that instability in Syria could spill into neighboring Iraq. Among the Alawite casualties were dozens of fighters, but most were civilians, according to activists. Defense Minister Israel Katz on Friday shared a graphic, unfiltered video on X, formerly Twitter, showing the bodies of executed men, some with their pants pulled down. His office said his comments came 'in light of the massacre carried out by [Ahmad al-]Jolani’s forces against Alawites in Syria,' referring to Syria’s new leader. Other disturbing footage from Syria appeared to show bodies being dragged behind vehicles, armed men forcing captives to crawl on all fours while barking, and summary executions. The violence has sparked strong reactions across the Muslim world, with regional powers taking opposing positions. The United Arab Emirates, which supports Syria’s new government, condemned 'the attacks against Syrian security forces' and reaffirmed its commitment to 'Syria’s stability, sovereignty over all its territory, and efforts to achieve peace, security, and stability.' Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, whose government backed Assad, blamed the new Syrian leadership for the unrest. 'The new rulers in Syria are responsible for the security of all Syrians. The instability there serves Israel’s interests and allows terrorist organizations and extremist militias to exploit the situation,' he said. A prominent Alawite figure from the coastal city of Baniyas told Ynet that conditions remain dire. He accused forces loyal to Syria’s new president Ahmad al-Sharaa of forcibly expelling Alawites from their homes and carrying out killings in the streets. 'Many are now homeless, hiding in forests, while bodies remain scattered in the open. No one can retrieve or bury them,' he said. 'Even the wounded are not allowed to enter hospitals. Armed groups are moving toward the coast, threatening to kill Alawites.' The source said he had reached out to Israel for assistance, asking it to intervene to protect Alawite civilians, who had been Syria’s ruling minority until Assad’s fall. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sytxeyto1e	2025-03-07T23:42:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/08/rkW11XUDtokx/rkW11XUDtokx_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
UNRWA helped Hamas kill our children': Hostage's mother demands ...	Ayelet Samerano, whose son Yonatan was killed and kidnapped by UN body's employee on October 7, slams organization's claims of it 'being under attack' An Israeli mother whose son was murdered and kidnapped by a United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) employee on October 7 confronted the United Nations Human Rights Council on Friday, accusing the international body of ignoring Israeli victims while defending the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. Speaking at the council’s opening session in Geneva, Ayelet Samerano addressed 193 ambassadors, demanding accountability for her son, Yonatan Samerano, whose body remains in Gaza. 'Mr. Rapporteur, in your report, you claim the reputation of UNRWA is under attack. I speak today as a mother. My son, Yonatan, 21 years old, was shot on October 7. Then an UNRWA social worker kidnapped him. Right now, Yonatan is still held by terrorists in Gaza,' she said. 'So I know what an attack is. An attack is when terrorists, including UNRWA employees like Muhammad Abu Itiwi, enter a music festival and murder innocent young people. An attack is when a UN social worker, paid by this organization, kidnapped my son into Gaza. A UN employee who took upon himself to do good, yet did evil. No, UNRWA is not under attack. UNRWA is the attacker.' Samerano accused UNRWA’s infrastructure of actively supporting Hamas, citing testimony from 84-year-old Ditza Heiman and Emily Damari, both former hostages, who testified that they were held captive in UNRWA facilities in Gaza. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'An UNRWA teacher held 84-year-old Ditza Heiman captive. Terrorists held Emily Damari captive in an UNRWA building. UNRWA's entire infrastructure helped Hamas kill our children,' she said. Turning directly to the UN official, she asked: 'You talk about human rights. What about human rights? What about Yonatan’s rights? What about the hostages still suffering in Gaza right now?' UNRWA has been under increasing scrutiny since Israel accused multiple agency employees of direct involvement in the October 7 Hamas-led attack that killed approximately 1,200 people and resulted in the abduction of around 250 hostages. The United States, Canada, and several European nations have suspended funding to the agency, and the UN has launched an internal investigation. Samerano also addressed claims that UNRWA had suffered from the deaths of its staff, responding: 'Your report, Mr. Rapporteur, speaks of the death of UNRWA staff. Does this include the UNRWA worker who kidnapped my son, Yonatan? Mr. Rapporteur, I ask you. I ask all of the UN.' UN Watch, a Geneva-based organization that monitors the UN, invited Samerano to speak at the council session. Its executive director, Hillel Neuer, later shared a video of her speech, which quickly gained millions of views. 'The UN should apologize for the fact that many UNRWA employees—including school principals and teachers—were exposed as participants in the October 7 massacre and helped hold hostages in UNRWA facilities and employees’ homes,' Neuer said. 'Instead of being fired and prosecuted, the UN has the audacity to claim that the real victims are UNRWA employees.' Samerano has been a vocal critic of UNRWA in recent months. In August 2024, she traveled to Switzerland for a UN Watch event attended by UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. Standing on an improvised stage, she revealed a shirt that read, 'UNRWA kidnapped my son,' and confronted Lazzarini directly, asking, 'Where is my son, Mr. Lazzarini? Why are you silent?' In November, she interrupted a UN conference on UNRWA, telling Lazzarini: 'You are not human. My life has been destroyed—and you are responsible.' Samerano continues to fight for the return of her son’s body as negotiations over a possible hostage deal remain uncertain. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1yn8okoke	2025-03-07T23:21:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/07/H1lj8Fpdsye/H1lj8Fpdsye_0_202_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Trump wrote to Iran’s leader about that country’s nuclear program...	POTUS' overture comes as both Israel and US warned they will never let Islamic Republic acquire nuclear weapon, leading to fears of military confrontation President Donald Trump sent a letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, seeking a new deal with Tehran to restrain its rapidly advancing nuclear program and replace the agreement he withdrew America from during his first term in office. Iranian state media immediately picked up on Trump’s acknowledgment, given in excerpts from a Fox Business Network interview that aired on Friday — though there was no confirmation from Khamenei’s office that any letter had been received. The interview airs in full Sunday. It remained unclear how the 85-year-old supreme leader would react, given that former President Barack Obama had kept his letters to Khamenei secret ahead of the start of negotiations that led to Tehran’s 2015 deal with world powers. In comments to reporters in the Oval Office later Friday, Trump did not mention the letter directly. But he made a veiled reference to possible military action, saying: 'We have a situation with Iran that, something’s going to happen very soon. Very, very soon.' 'Hopefully we can have a peace deal,' Trump said. 'I’m not speaking out of strength or weakness. I’m just saying I’d rather see a peace deal than the other. But the other will solve the problem.' Trump’s overture comes as both Israel and the United States have warned they will never let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, leading to fears of a military confrontation as Tehran enriches uranium at near weapons-grade levels — something only done by atomic-armed nations. In the interview with Fox host Maria Bartiromo for 'Sunday Morning Futures,' Trump said, 'I’ve written them a letter saying, ‘I hope you’re going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it’s going to be a terrible thing.’' The United Nations welcomed Trump’s outreach to Iran. 'As a matter of principle, we reaffirm that diplomacy remains the best way to ensure the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear program,' spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement. 'We welcome all diplomatic efforts towards that goal.' Trump’s outreach comes amid tensions The White House confirmed that Trump’s letter to Iran’s leaders is seeking to negotiate a nuclear deal. The president’s comments in the Oval Office echoed his sentiments from the interview, in which he said the letter had been sent Wednesday. 'I would rather negotiate a deal. I’m not sure that everybody agrees with me, but we can make a deal that would be just as good as if you won militarily,' Trump said in the interview. 'But the time is happening now. The time is coming up. Something’s going to happen one way or the other.' 'We have to do something because you can’t let them have a nuclear weapon,' he added. Trump offered no details on what, if anything, was specifically offered to Iran in the letter. The move recalled Trump’s letter-writing to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in his first term, which led to face-to-face meetings, but no deals to limit Pyongyang’s atomic bombs and a missile program capable of reaching the continental U.S. Iran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb as tensions are high with the U.S. over its sanctions and with Israel as a shaky ceasefire holds in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since Trump returned to the White House, his administration has consistently said that Iran must be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons. A report last month, however, by the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog said Iran has accelerated its production of near weapons-grade uranium. Trump’s first term in office was marked by a particularly troubled period in relations with Tehran. In 2018, he unilaterally withdrew the United States from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, leading to sanctions hobbling Iran’s economy. Iran retaliated with attacks at sea — including one that it likely carried out and that temporarily halved Saudi Arabia’s oil production. Trump also ordered the attack that killed Iran’s top general in a Baghdad drone strike in January 2020. Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile surges Under the original 2015 nuclear deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity and maintain a stockpile of uranium of 300 kilograms (661 pounds). The last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency on Iran’s program put its stockpile at 8,294.4 kilograms (18,286 pounds) as it enriches a fraction of it to 60% purity, a short, technical step to weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iran’s accelerated production of near weapons-grade uranium puts more pressure on Trump. He’s repeatedly said he’s open to negotiations with the Islamic Republic while also increasingly targeting Iran’s oil sales with sanctions as part of his reimposed 'maximum pressure' policy. Khamenei in a speech last August opened the door to talks with the U.S., saying there is 'no harm' in engaging with the 'enemy.' However, more recently the supreme leader tempered that, saying that negotiations with America 'are not intelligent, wise or honorable,' after Trump floated nuclear talks with Tehran. Whether Khamenei even would accept a letter remains in question. A previous attempt in 2019 for Trump to exchange a letter to Khamenei through the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw the supreme leader refuse it and declare: 'I do not consider Trump personally worthy of exchanging any messages, nor do I have any response for him, and I never will.' But it also remains unclear how Iran will handle further pressure. The Islamic Republic’s currency, the rial, has dramatically fallen in value. Unemployment and underemployment remain rampant. Meanwhile, women have continued their defiance of laws on the mandatory headscarf, or hijab, and continue to go without the head-covering, two years after the death of a detained young woman, Mahsa Amini, sparked nationwide protests. Israel and Iran also have traded direct attacks during the Israel-Hamas war, while partners in Tehran’s self-described 'Axis of Resistance' are reeling after the assassinations of their leaders by Israel. In Israel itself, officials have suggested striking Iran’s nuclear program now, something Trump has threatened while still insisting he’d prefer reaching a diplomatic deal with Tehran.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk5p68yoye	2025-03-07T21:11:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/07/r100SLOdiJe/r100SLOdiJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Gene Hackman died at home a week after wife Betsy Arakawa died fr...	Forensic experts came to a heartrending conclusion Friday about the manner of death for actor Gene Hackman - heart failure with complications from Alzheimer's disease on an empty stomach a week after a rare, rodent-borne disease took the life of his wife at their home in Santa Fe. The partially mummified remains of Hackman, 95, and Betsy Arakawa, 65, were discovered Feb. 26 when maintenance and security workers showed up at the home and alerted police. Authorities unraveled the mysterious circumstances and revealed that Arakawa likely died Feb. 11 at home from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings. Hackman, in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's, apparently was unaware that his wife was dead. 'He was in a very poor state of health. He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that's what resulted in his death,' chief medical investigator Dr. Heather Jarrell said. 'It's quite possible he was not aware she was deceased.' Both deaths were ruled to be from natural causes.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkqhjltjjg	2025-03-07T20:56:25-08:00	
Is Iran and US on track for a nuclear deal? Israel's stance and r...	For years, Israel opposed an agreement with Iran, highlighting its violations, but with Trump’s return and engagement with Tehran, Israel now prefers diplomacy over military action, though its goal remains preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons Following months of escalating threats and reports suggesting Israel might consider major military strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, Israel’s stance appears to have shifted as U.S. President Donald Trump looks to negotiate a new nuclear deal with Iran. Israel, which had previously expressed strong opposition to a nuclear agreement with Iran, is now more open to the possibility of a diplomatic solution. While Israel still supports a credible military option, officials say they would prefer diplomacy if an agreement could prevent Tehran from obtaining nuclear weapons. President Trump, in an interview with Fox Business Network, confirmed that he is seeking negotiations with Iran. 'I hope you're going to negotiate because it's going to be a lot better for Iran,' he said. Iran, in turn, has approached the United States through Switzerland, signaling its interest in engaging in talks aimed at advancing a nuclear deal. Last month, while signing an expansion of sanctions against Iran, an Israeli official told The Washington Post that Israel had developed plans to carry out joint military strikes with the U.S. on Iranian nuclear facilities following an attack in October. However, as diplomatic talks have gained traction, Israel no longer rules out a new deal, as long as it prevents Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran in May 2018, after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented what he called 'Iran's nuclear archive,' demonstrating that Tehran had been dishonest about its nuclear ambitions. Despite a lack of trust in Iran, Israeli officials say they are not ruling out the possibility of a new agreement that would secure Iran's compliance. Israel continues to prepare for the possibility of military action, including ensuring the readiness of its forces and weaponry. However, officials also emphasize the importance of diplomatic solutions. To that end, Israel has increased military coordination with the U.S., including joint exercises involving Israeli fighter jets and U.S. bombers. These actions signal a united front between the two nations, highlighting their shared goal of addressing Iran's nuclear ambitions. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has warned that a military strike on Iran's nuclear program would spark a broader Middle Eastern conflict. 'A military attack would lead to a huge escalation in the region,' he said in an interview with AFP. Araghchi also rejected the possibility of talks under Trump’s 'maximum pressure' sanctions policy, emphasizing that Iran remains open to negotiations but is committed to defending its nuclear program. He added, 'If Iran’s nuclear facilities are attacked, we will respond immediately and decisively.' As tensions between Iran and the West continue to rise, Israel appears to be balancing its preparation for military action with a growing willingness to pursue diplomatic channels, contingent on ensuring that Iran’s nuclear ambitions are effectively contained. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1let1yske	2025-03-07T12:55:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/ryeWfliLJe/ryeWfliLJe_0_0_853_488_0_small.jpg
Syria's Alawites appeal to Israel as violence intensifies	Violence between Syria’s new regime and Assad loyalists escalates, with 229 dead; Alawite source calls for Israeli intervention, citing oppression, executions, and atrocities against civilians Violent clashes between security forces of Syria’s new regime and those loyal to ousted president Bashar al-Assad continued Friday, with the death toll rising to 229 over two days along Syria's coastal region, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Among the dead were 134 Alawites, who were reportedly executed The violence has escalated across areas such as Latakia and Tartus, where many of Syria’s Alawite minority, including Assad's supporters, reside. These regions have long experienced alleged harassment and abuse from the new regime, led by Ahmad al-Shara, who insists the reported incidents are isolated. Following the disturbing scenes from battles across the country, Defense Minister Israel Katz shared a graphic, unedited video on his X account showing the bodies of men who had been shot, some with their pants down. 'al-Julani took off his galabiya, put on a suit, and presented a moderate facade. Now, he has removed the mask, revealing his true face: a jihadist terrorist from the Al-Qaeda school, committing atrocities against the Alawite civilian population,' Katz wrote. 'Israel will defend itself against any threat from Syria. We will remain in the security zones and Mount Hermon and protect the communities of the Golan and Galilee. We will ensure that southern Syria remains demilitarized and free of threats, and we will protect the local Druze population - anyone who harms them will face our response.' An Alawite source, managing a local news page from the coastal town of Anis, spoke with Ynet, claiming the recent violence was a natural development due to the regime's oppression. 'The situation in neighborhoods like al-Datur in Latakia and in Jableh is worsening. Forest fires, mass arrests, daily violations — it's not a planned uprising,' the source explained. He described the unrest as a response to systematic oppression, not support for Assad’s regime. 'The people can no longer tolerate the daily humiliation and terror,' he said, adding that the events were sectarian and not politically motivated by Assad loyalists. He also accused the regime of committing atrocities against defenseless civilians, including looting homes, stealing valuables, and arresting young people. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The source appealed directly to Israel for intervention, referring to Israel’s past statements about protecting the Druze community in Syria. 'The Alawites are asking for Netanyahu's immediate intervention,' he said, echoing growing calls from other minority groups facing persecution under the new government. Meanwhile, Syrian security officials, including a commander in the Tartus security apparatus, told Al-Jazeera that the violence was linked to remnants of Assad's regime collaborating with external actors. They claimed that sophisticated communications and weapons were found, with evidence that remnants of Assad’s forces were receiving regular payments to carry out attacks. Syria's General Intelligence Directorate chief, Anas Khattab, added in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that initial investigations suggested former military and security figures from Assad's regime were behind the recent violence, operating under the guidance of high-profile fugitives who had fled the country. He vowed retribution, declaring, 'We will not forgive those whose hands are stained with the blood of our people.' As the situation in Syria intensifies, minority groups like the Alawites continue to face severe repression, and their appeals for international intervention grow louder. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syzbb1fijl	2025-03-07T12:38:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/07/B1gIz2Mdskl/B1gIz2Mdskl_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Israel strikes Hezbollah sites in southern Lebanon, largest attac...	Lebanese reports said Israeli planes carried out about 30 strikes across southern Lebanon; IDF spokesman confirmed the attacks shortly after, stating that Hezbollah weapons and rocket launchers were targeted, posing a threat to Israel and violating agreements The IDF launched an extensive airstrike on Hezbollah military sites in southern Lebanon on Friday, marking the largest attack since the ceasefire agreement took effect. The strikes targeted weapons and rocket launchers used by the Iran-backed terror group Hezbollah, which is active in the region. An Israeli military spokesperson stated that the presence of weapons and rocket launchers in these sites poses a threat to Israel and is a blatant violation of the agreements between Israel and Lebanon. 'The IDF will continue to act to remove any threat to Israel and will prevent any attempt by Hezbollah to rebuild and entrench itself,' the spokesperson added. The strikes occurred in the Wadi Zibqin area and between the villages of Ayta al-Jabal and Beit Yahoun, near the Litani River and the village of al-Ashiya, according to the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen network. Lebanese sources reported that the strikes were the most extensive in the area since the ceasefire was implemented, with approximately 30 strikes carried out across a wide area. Hezbollah’s Al-Manar channel stated that around 20 strikes took place in several villages.

Two days earlier, a drone strike targeted a vehicle near the village of al-Qasr, close to the Syria-Lebanon border. According to Saudi network Al-Hadath, the vehicle contained a Hezbollah member named Maher Nasr al-Din, who was killed in the attack. The location of the strike was approximately 150 kilometers from the Israeli border in northern Bekaa. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjmpzjtjke	2025-03-07T12:22:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/07/ryPF2aOiJx/ryPF2aOiJx_215_253_906_510_0_small.jpg

Trump revokes $400 million in grants to Columbia University	Newly established task force on antisemitism says Columbia’s $5 billion in federal funding is under review, calling this action just the beginning of the process The Trump administration announced Friday that it is revoking $400 million in grants to Columbia University in New York, citing the university’s failure to take sufficient action against antisemitism on campus following Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack. 'This is just the beginning of the process,' stated the administration’s newly established task force on combating antisemitism, which is leading the move. The task force added that all federal funding to Columbia—totaling $5 billion—is now under review. The decision comes just days after President Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he would cut funding to universities that allow illegal protests. Brian Cohen, executive director of Columbia/Barnard Hillel, responded to the funding freeze, saying, 'Columbia has an antisemitism crisis. I hope this federal action serves as a wake-up call for the administration and the board of trustees to take antisemitism and the harassment of Jewish students and faculty seriously. That way, grants can be restored, Columbia can continue its vital work, and the university can once again be a place where the Jewish community thrives.'

The evacuation occurred after a group of protesters took over the library, prompting the New York Police Department to enter and arrest at least ten demonstrators.

Israel's elite drone unit emerges as lethal force, eliminates ove...	With upgraded tech and female soldiers in enemy territory, Israel’s small drone unit—left inactive on Oct. 7—has boosted its lethal capabilities; Now key to recon, pursuit, and strikes in Gaza and Lebanon, it operates even in harsh weather The IDF Sky Rider drone unit, known as 'Rochev Shamayim,' has evolved into one of the military’s most lethal forces, responsible for eliminating more than 700 Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists since the start of the war. Once primarily reliant on small surveillance drones, the unit now operates advanced attack and reconnaissance drones, providing real-time support to ground forces. During the IDF's prolonged operations in Gaza's Jabaliya area before the hostage deal, Rochev Shamayim teams were responsible for nearly 60% of targeted strikes. Unit commander Lt. Col. A. said in an interview that the war has transformed the unit, shifting from basic reconnaissance missions to direct engagement, intelligence gathering, and precision strikes using a variety of drones. A key advantage of the unit is its ability to provide immediate aerial support to ground forces, eliminating the need to wait for air force drones or attack helicopters. In some cases, drones were deployed in poor weather conditions when air force operations were restricted. Recently released footage shows Rochev Shamayim operatives identifying a Hamas member preparing a rocket launcher in a destroyed building in Jabaliya. The operative was confirmed as a target and eliminated within moments. Another clip from southern Lebanon shows Hezbollah operatives loading weapons into a vehicle in violation of the ceasefire agreement. More than 40 Hezbollah members have been eliminated in similar operations in recent weeks. 'The unit has developed the capability to detect terrorists hiding inside buildings, even while infantry and armored forces are advancing,' said Lt. Col. A. 'Our teams are deployed at the front lines, working closely with battalion and company commanders, giving them real-time intelligence and strike capability.' During the October 7 attack, a team from Rochev Shamayim was stationed at the Nahal Oz base but was not activated, despite repeated requests from team commander Capt. Eden Nimri, who was later killed in combat. The unit has since expanded significantly, integrating reserve forces and growing to the size of an average battalion. It operates in a force-multiplying role, similar to elite units like Oketz (the IDF’s canine unit) and Yahalom (combat engineers), with small teams embedded within battalions. The unit is now preparing for renewed combat in Gaza and plays a central role in border defense operations in Syria and Lebanon. 'Rochev Shamayim fighters have identified and eliminated, or directly guided strikes that killed, more than 700 terrorists, primarily in Gaza,' Lt. Col. A. said. 'In a recent operation in Jabaliya, they eliminated over 10 terrorists within hours. In another case, a three-person team took out or assisted in neutralizing 60 terrorists in northern Gaza over the past month.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He noted that the unit’s front-line deployment gives it an operational edge compared to air force drone operators working from remote bases. 'Our teams operate in the field, not from air-conditioned control rooms with a cup of coffee,' he said. However, he acknowledged the psychological toll, as team members frequently witness their fellow soldiers wounded or killed in battle. The unit provides mental health support to its fighters, with only those injured in the October 7 attack having left. Rochev Shamayim is now preparing to deploy an upgraded version of Elbit’s Skylark drone, featuring vertical takeoff and high-speed horizontal flight, with plans to eventually integrate small precision-guided missiles. The first team is currently training on the new platform. 'During the war, our unit grew by 30%, and we now have five all-female teams, in addition to mixed-gender teams,' Lt. Col. A. said. 'While some missions require male fighters due to heavy equipment, once we secure operational control in enemy territory—whether in Gaza or Lebanon—our female teams also operate there.' Second Lt. S., a team commander, added, 'Over the past year, we’ve gone from targeting Hezbollah operatives at the Lebanese border to operating directly in ground combat alongside infantry brigades. We now identify deeper Hezbollah positions, hidden infrastructure, and rocket launchers concealed in orchards—and strike them without requiring ground troops to reach those sites first. Personally, I’ve directed various types of firepower, with munitions hitting their targets within minutes.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1hz7auojx	2025-03-07T11:19:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/04/rk11ch4Eoye/rk11ch4Eoye_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Israel and US plan to ask an American court for access to social media servers to gather evidence for criminal charges related to the October 7 massacre, with the goal to recover deleted footage filmed on the day of the attack, as well as track phones to pinpoint the terrorists' exact locations More than a year after the October 7 massacre, Israel and the U.S. are working together to gather evidence to support charges against Hamas terrorists. The two countries are preparing a request to an American court for a search warrant that would allow them to access servers of social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and X. The goal is to retrieve deleted footage taken by Hamas militants during the attacks to strengthen evidence in ongoing cases. Israel and the U.S. have been collaborating on this issue, with American officials traveling to Israel for meetings. The effort focuses on retrieving videos of the October 7 massacre that were deleted and some content that may still be stored on social media servers. Israel’s police have already shared investigative materials, including visuals, with U.S. authorities to assist in breaking cases and gathering intelligence. The challenge lies in linking the captured militants to specific crimes. Many cases have faced significant evidentiary difficulties, primarily because the crime scenes were not treated with the same procedures as regular criminal investigations, complicating the gathering of proof. U.S. authorities have the legal authority to issue such warrants, even for servers outside the U.S. This cooperation is seen as crucial in accessing important materials on social media servers, which could not only help with criminal cases but also provide intelligence benefits. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israel could have sought a search warrant in its own courts, but there are diplomatic and legal sensitivities when accessing servers located outside its borders. The U.S. law, however, allows for the compelled production of information from tech companies, regardless of where their servers are located. This legal difference has led Israel to seek American assistance in this sensitive investigation. This collaboration is also part of an ongoing investigation by the U.S. into the October 7 attack, which involved American victims and hostages. The findings from this cooperation are expected to contribute to both legal proceedings and intelligence efforts. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkdekooskx	2025-03-07T08:21:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/yk14286873/yk14286873_0_83_1012_570_0_small.jpg

Both parties meet in Cairo in an attempt to bridge deal gaps amid negotiations deadlock; Israeli official says US envoy Steve Witkoff is not expected to visit the region until 'there are loose ends to finalize' A Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo on Friday for negotiations following a reported U.S. proposal to the terror group, as Israel expressed satisfaction with threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and remained hopeful for progress. A senior Israeli official said Friday afternoon that Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, is not expected to visit the region at this stage. 'He will come only when there are loose ends to finalize. No progress is known at this time,' the official said. The official described Washington’s direct engagement with Hamas as 'a bonus without a deal,' adding that the U.S. is primarily focused on securing the release of American hostages.

Iran’s foreign ministry summoned the British ambassador over what it described as 'baseless' accusations by U.K. officials against the government, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency said Friday.

Hamas releases video showing footage of hostage Matan Angrest	After 518 in captivity, the terror group published first video of hostage soldier Matan Angrest; 'The military placed them there on October 7, and the state is abandoning them, leaving them behind' parents say in a meeting with IDF chief Hamas released on Friday a video showing proof of life of hostage Matan Angrest, who has been held captive in Gaza for 518 days. The family has yet to confirm the video's publication or the statements made in it. Earlier this week, Angrest’s parents—whose son, an Israeli soldier who was abducted wounded and unconscious from his tank at the Nahal Oz military base on October 7—released the first footage of him in captivity. The footage was taken at least six months after his abduction. 'We demand that the Israeli government implement all stages of the hostage deal before moving on to the next phase of the war,' his mother, Anat, said. She stressed the urgency of securing his release, stating, 'Matan is in mortal danger. All the hostages must be brought home before more soldiers are sent to battle and don’t return.' Anat and Haggai Angrest met Friday with IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir. 'We demand, first and foremost, the return of the hostages—only then should Hamas be dealt with,' they stressed. 'The top priority must be the hostages because they don’t have time. Lives are turning into casualties and casualties into missing persons. We cannot resume the war while hostages are still there. Bringing them back must be a milestone for continuing the war.' As former hostages met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington and senior White House officials stressed that American hostages remain a top priority, Matan Angrest’s parents emphasized their demand for international intervention. 'The Americans put their soldiers and fallen troops at the top of the headlines, and we ask them to help bring back the soldiers who don’t hold citizenship as well,' they said. 'It is unacceptable that a humanitarian list that included wounded hostages did not include soldiers who went out to defend the country and were injured—only for the state to abandon them and leave them behind, at the very end.' 'They are the only ones the state decided to place there that day, at that hour. The military put them there. There is an obligation—both from the IDF and the state—and yet they are treated as second-class.' According to the family, Angrest, who was taken while critically wounded, is enduring severe mistreatment in captivity, including torture during interrogations, and is being held under 'inhumane conditions.' The family also said that Angrest was excluded from the recent humanitarian release 'solely because he is an Israeli soldier.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Less than a month ago, Angrest’s father, Hagai, said the family received confirmation that he was alive through freed hostages. The accounts, which surfaced six months after Angrest appeared in a propaganda video from Gaza, indicated that he remains severely injured and is being held in harsh conditions. 'We heard from released hostages that our beloved son Matan is alive. It was incredibly emotional for us,' his father said. 'The time has come to bring him back, along with all the others. We expect Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to advance the second phase of the deal immediately. We all saw the horrific images—scenes of a Holocaust in 2025, here in Israel. Bring Matan and the rest of the hostages home now. Their situation is dire, and it is time to bring them back.' In September, Matan’s mother revealed an audio recording of her son at a demonstration on Begin Street in Tel Aviv. In the recording, he is heard addressing Netanyahu in a video filmed in captivity, in words that may have been dictated by his captors. 'Netanyahu, you must, must carry out this prisoner exchange between the prisoners in Israel and the prisoners here. I really want to see my family and friends. It’s very important. I think you can do it; you just have to want to. But I trust you. You can make it happen, and I hope it will be as soon as possible,' Matan said in the recording. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1y001ydj1x	2025-03-07T05:24:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/03/HkucstXjJg/HkucstXjJg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

US president urges Iran to negotiate a nuclear deal in a direct letter to Khamenei, warning of unspecified consequences if diplomacy fails U.S. President Donald Trump said he wants to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran and sent a letter to its leadership on Thursday saying he hoped they would agree to talk. 'I said I hope you're going to negotiate, because it's going to be a lot better for Iran,' Trump said in the interview with Fox Business Network broadcast Friday. 'I think they want to get that letter. The other alternative is we have to do something, because you can't let another nuclear weapon,' he added.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov discussed international efforts to resolve the situation around Iran's nuclear program with Iranian ambassador Kazem Jalali, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Friday. Trump's words come after the Israeli Air Force and U.S. Air Force conducted a joint aerial exercise this week, aiming to bolster military cooperation and enhance integrated operational capabilities. The exercise came amid escalating concerns over Iran's advancing nuclear program. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that as of February 8, 2025, Iran's stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% reached 274.8 kilograms, marking a significant increase of 92.5 kilograms since November 2024. This level of enrichment is nearing weapons-grade material, intensifying fears that Tehran is approaching nuclear breakout capability. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bko6vdosye	2025-03-07T03:45:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/15/HkYYDpVfJx/HkYYDpVfJx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

IDF considers banning soldier filming at national ceremonies over...	Military weighs unprecedented restrictions on filming soldiers at national ceremonies amid fears of international arrest warrants tied to Gaza war allegations The IDF is considering banning the filming of soldiers at national ceremonies this year over concerns they could later be identified abroad and face arrest warrants for alleged war crimes amid the war in Gaza. With Israel’s Memorial Day and Independence Day approaching, the issue has been discussed in government forums, but security officials say no final decision has been made. The main concern is the annual ceremony honoring 120 outstanding soldiers at the president’s residence, where participants are traditionally photographed. Other high-profile events include Memorial Day ceremonies at Jerusalem’s Western Wall and Mount Herzl, as well as the Independence Day torch-lighting ceremony, which features IDF flag bearers from various units. Paratroopers and other combat soldiers, many of whom fought in the war in Gaza, are typically filmed during these events, potentially exposing them to legal action when traveling abroad. Anti-Israel organizations, such as the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF), have been filing lawsuits against IDF soldiers for their actions in Gaza. The fund cross-references soldiers' faces with their social media profiles to initiate legal proceedings and arrest warrant requests in various countries. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: HRF previously forced an IDF soldier to flee Brazil and has also pursued cases against Israeli troops in Chile, Argentina and Thailand. Senior officers are also being targeted. HRF’s founder, Dyab Abou Jahjah, announced that the organization had petitioned the International Criminal Court in The Hague to issue an arrest warrant for Maj. Gen. Ghassan Alian, who heads the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), while he was in Italy in January. At the start of the year, the IDF issued strict media coverage guidelines for soldiers and officers. Any reporting on operational activity now requires specific approval. Officers ranked brigadier general and above can be interviewed with their full name, position and unit affiliation only after prior briefing. Lower-ranking officers must be filmed from behind or with their faces blurred and can only be identified by the first letter of their name. The guidelines explicitly prohibit linking interviewees to specific combat incidents without special approval. They also ban revealing the names of soldiers with foreign citizenship and mandate blurring their faces in any media coverage. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skuvmd00syx	2025-03-07T03:24:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/05/04/SJ56XSlLc/SJ56XSlLc_0_170_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

'During my three decades in the IDF, I have always prioritized the state’s security and our mission, and I urge you to remain steadfast in this commitment,' Hagari said. 'We must stay professional, truthful and dedicated to earning public trust.

IDF chief Zamir blocks spokesperson Hagari's promotion, says will...	Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir has axes Daniel Hagari's military advancement and announces his departure within weeks; decision comes after months of tensions surrounding Hagari’s outspoken remarks IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir decided Friday that the military's top spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari will not be promoted to vice admiral and will leave the military. According to an IDF statement, the two 'agreed on Hagari’s departure.' Zamir expressed 'great appreciation for Hagari’s years of significant combat service for Israel.' The statement added that Hagari had carried out his role 'professionally and with dedication' during 'one of the most complex wars in Israel’s history.' Hagari, a former commander of the Israeli Navy's elite Shayetet 13 unit, was frequently the public face of the war while political leaders remained silent, including during difficult events. One of his most controversial remarks came when he criticized a proposed law which would grant immunity to those leaking classified information to Israel’s prime minister. 'This law is extremely dangerous for the IDF. It would allow any low-level figure in the military to steal documents,' Hagari said at the time. He later expanded on his concerns, warning that such a law 'would endanger lives, including those of soldiers and pose a serious risk to national security.' His comments sparked a political firestorm and then-IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi reprimanded him for 'overstepping his authority.' The IDF said at the time that 'the military does not criticize lawmakers but presents its position to the decision-maker through established channels.' Following the reprimand, Hagari acknowledged that he had spoken 'beyond his authority as IDF spokesperson' and stressed that the military 'conveys its stance on legislation through proper channels, not in other ways.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Tensions escalated further when Defense Minister Israel Katz ordered Halevi to cooperate with the state comptroller’s investigation. The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit responded sharply, urging Katz to 'resolve issues through dialogue, not the media.' Katz’s spokesperson hit back, implicitly calling for Hagari’s dismissal: 'The IDF spokesperson, who recently apologized for overstepping his authority and attacking decision-makers, has done so again. This time, an apology won’t be enough.' In December, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ally Jacob Bardugo claimed Hagari would not be promoted and warned, 'If Defense Minister Israel Katz signs off on such a move, it will be the last day he serves as defense minister in a right-wing government.' Zamir’s swift decision surprised many in the IDF. Unlike past IDF spokespersons, Hagari was on the command track for promotion to vice admiral and was considered a candidate to lead the Israeli Navy, having distinguished himself as commander of Shayetet 13. Halevi had also recommended his promotion, citing his performance during the war and his lack of involvement in the October 7 failures. Zamir’s decision effectively ousted Hagari before removing officers directly tied to those failures. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjeseloojg	2025-03-07T02:33:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/07/S1WqDSdokg/S1WqDSdokg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

In a statement, the State Department said, 'Yesterday evening, we revoked the first visa of an alien who was previously cited for criminal behavior in connection with Hamas-supporting disruptions. This individual was a university student. ICE will proceed with removing this person from the country.' The student's identity and university were not disclosed due to 'legal constraints,' the department added.

Second war with Hamas inevitable, expert warns	Prof. Kobi Michael: In the early stages of the war, the Biden administration 'actually tied one hand of Israel behind its back' Hamas is unlikely to release all of the hostages—alive or dead—making a second military confrontation between Israel and Hamas inevitable, according to Prof. Kobi Michael of the Misgav Institute for National Security & Zionist Strategy. 'If Israel does not implement its objectives and figure out the war against Hamas, which means that Hamas will not be [in Gaza] anymore as a sovereign power, we are going to face very challenging threats on all other fronts that were involved in this war,' Michael said. He made these remarks during the latest episode of ILTV Insider, speaking against the backdrop of a recent U.S. State Department assessment that Hamas had reconstituted itself with as many fighters as before the war began. Additionally, scenes from recent hostage releases showed hundreds of Hamas members in uniform, reinforcing the notion that the terror group remains in control of the Gaza Strip. However, Michael said he expects a different outcome this time. He noted that, in the early stages of the war, the Biden administration 'actually tied one hand of Israel behind its back.' Now, he said, the U.S. is much more supportive of Israel’s efforts to eliminate Hamas. Watch previous episodes of Insider: Israeli Sovereignty Over Judea & Samaria: Is this Prophecy Unfolding? Is Israel Winning This War, Or Just Prolonging The Inevitable? Is Trump’s Gaza Strategy a Diplomatic Breakthrough or a Disaster? Michael also pointed to missteps by Israel’s military and political leadership early in the war, saying they erred by not reoccupying Gaza until Hamas was eradicated. 'Now, we are in a different position,' Michael said, 'with a different administration, with a different experience, and with different military personnel. And I assume that even the relationship between the political and military personnel could be different.' However, former Israeli Ambassador to Germany Jeremy Issacharoff agreed that Israel may need to continue the war but argued that this should not happen until all the hostages have been released and Israel can demonstrate that it has exhausted all possible diplomatic efforts to prevent further conflict. 'Our diplomatic situation in the world, and I've seen problems amid diplomatic circles, I think our situation today has become very, very negative,' Issacharoff said. 'It is very concerning to me.' Michael said that Israel can disregard European opposition to its fight against Hamas, emphasizing that American support is 'much more important.' Once Israel resumes the war—because, in his view, there is no other option—Michael believes 'the rest of the world will follow America.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkdknn00i1g	2025-03-07T00:02:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/ryeXhDvDoJe/ryeXhDvDoJe_0_0_2048_1153_0_small.jpg
US proposal to Hamas: 'Terror group seeks benefits in direct chan...	Reports say Trump administration seeks to free Israeli-American hostages through a cease-fire deal with Hamas while tensions flare as president warns of military escalation if negotiations fail The Washington Post reported Friday overnight that the U.S. proposed a deal to Hamas to release several live Israeli hostages, including dual U.S.-Israeli citizen and IDF soldier Edan Alexander, in exchange for a two-month cease-fire extension and continued humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza. On Thursday, Sky News Arabia cited a Palestinian source saying the U.S. had asked Hamas to release 10 hostages as part of the offer. According to the Washington Post, Hamas has yet to respond to the proposal, which was discussed in meetings between Trump hostages envoy Adam Boehler and senior Hamas officials, including the terror group’s Gaza leader, Khalil al-Hayya, in Qatar. A diplomat familiar with the discussions told the outlet that Boehler and Hamas held multiple direct meetings without Qatari mediation. The report noted that Hamas previously rejected a proposal by Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, which called for the release of half of the hostages immediately, with negotiations for the rest tied to a cease-fire during Ramadan and Passover. However, U.S. officials quoted by the outlet said Hamas was weighing the potential benefits of a direct deal with the Trump administration. Officially, Hamas continues to demand a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war, along with a Palestinian prisoner exchange for Israeli hostages. Sky News Arabia also reported Thursday that the new U.S. offer includes the release of 10 live hostages in exchange for a two-month cease-fire extension in Gaza. The names of the hostages were not disclosed, though U.S. media identified Edan Alexander as one of them. In Washington, analysts examined Trump’s recent threats in a social media post after meeting with a delegation of freed hostages. U.S. officials told the Wall Street Journal that Trump’s statement pointed to two possible outcomes: If Hamas releases the hostages, the U.S. will push for a permanent end to the war. If Hamas refuses, Trump is prepared to greenlight Israel’s military campaign against the terror group in Gaza. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s Al-Akhbar newspaper cited sources in Palestinian terror organizations who said their operatives were instructed to take precautions, cease using wireless communications and take Israel’s threats seriously. The sources warned that if mediation efforts fail to extend the cease-fire and halt the war, the IDF would target key figures and carry out 'special operations' in populated areas. Following Trump's meeting with freed hostages, senior Hamas official Basem Naim published an 'open letter' cynically suggesting that Trump also meet with released Palestinian prisoners to 'present balance.' Naim claimed that 9,500 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails were denied basic rights, including family visits and were subjected to 'ongoing psychological and physical torture.' After leaving their meeting with Trump, freed hostages met with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who was in Washington for talks with his U.S. counterpart, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Smotrich, who opposes the current hostage deal, recited to freed hostage Eli Sharabi a Jewish prayer thanking God for his release. Smotrich assured Sharabi that despite his opposition to the deal, he was 'working to bring all the hostages home.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sharabi responded, 'I’m here to make sure this happens with America’s help.' His brother, Sharon, told Smotrich, 'It's not enough to share the same goal — the timing is critical for saving lives and returning the fallen. The responsibility is also on your shoulders.' A day after his direct warning to Hamas, Trump confirmed that his administration was in direct talks with the terror group. 'We are having discussions and helping Israel,' he said. Witkoff added, 'It's time for Hamas to start acting responsibly and rationally.' Following his meeting with freed hostages, Trump said, 'I had the honor of spending a lot of time with several of the hostages we got out, and I can’t believe how horribly they were treated. Some of the stories were so terrible they couldn’t be shared.' 'We have 59 left — of which 24 are living [and] they said they’re in very bad shape… [but the released hostages] want to know if we could just continue,' he added. When asked about direct negotiations with Hamas, Trump replied, ' We’re not doing anything in terms of Hamas. We’re not giving cash. You have to negotiate. There’s a difference between negotiating and paying. We want to get these people out.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1pzhmujye	2025-03-06T23:56:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/07/H1qEPMdiJl/H1qEPMdiJl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

You're under attack by Hamas': IDF chief Eyal Zamir launches ter...	Newly appointed IDF chief of staff wastes no time making his mark, launching a surprise military drill near Gaza on his first day; with war still unresolved, top commander is pushing for combat readiness and urgent structural changes within the army IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir marked his first day in office with a visit to the Gaza Strip, signaling a shift in approach following his predecessor Herzi Halevi’s failure to bring the ongoing war to a decisive end. However, Zamir’s visit was more than just a symbolic gesture — he staged an unannounced drill at a frontline position near Beit Hanoun. 'You’re under attack by Hamas,' he told the stationed company commander. Officers present said the outgoing IDF Southern Command chief, Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman was caught off guard. During the drill, Zamir simulated an October 7-style assault, moved between positions questioning soldiers on threats in the area, and even operated a machine gun himself. When the drill concluded, he told a company commander from the Netzah Yehuda Battalion, 'An attack like this will happen. It’s not a question of 'if' but 'when,' and you need to be ready.' Zamir’s opening act was clearly intended to send a message. He is taking charge of an army still reeling from the failures of October 7, a reality exposed in investigative reports. His newly appointed team, as reported by Ynet, will now work to correct the severe flaws in those inquiries. Senior military officials describe Zamir as stepping into the role with urgency, knowing time is not on his side. He made this clear to IDF leaders during a late-night personnel meeting, to the soldiers at the outpost and to municipal leaders he met. 'The war could reignite at any moment,' he told them. 'Hamas must be decisively defeated.' In his first official order, he acknowledged the military’s failure on October 7 and vowed to shake up the system. Given the ongoing issues with readiness and discipline, he faces an uphill battle with no grace period.

Another high-level staffing discussion ran late into the night, beginning at 8:30 p.m. and dragging into the early hours. A similar meeting on Wednesday night lasted until nearly 4:00 a.m., followed by a strategic briefing just two hours later. 'It was a tough discussion,' a senior officer said. 'We talked about many fallen officers and shared memories of them.' Unlike performative leadership tactics, Zamir’s relentless pace stems from necessity. The outgoing chief’s insistence on remaining in office led to a bottleneck, leaving dozens of officers uncertain about their assignments. This caused internal unrest at a time when the IDF is already stretched thin against mounting regional threats. One of Zamir’s key priorities is strengthening the IDF’s ground forces, including forming a new tank brigade and reinstating reconnaissance units in armored divisions. But to achieve this, he requires more combat soldiers — something the government is not helping with, as it struggles to pass a new draft law. During his inaugural speech, Zamir underscored the importance of equal military service across all communities, making it clear he would not rubber-stamp legislation that increases draft exemptions. At the same time, he used religious language that earned praise in some circles. But he knows he’s walking a fine line, with political dangers that may prove even more treacherous than those in Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syiubzoi1l	2025-03-06T21:52:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/yk14286979/yk14286979_0_0_1360_765_0_small.jpg

Trump's threat against Hamas puts the burden on Israel'	Former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Danny Ayalon: 'The threat, if needed, will be materialized or realized by Israel. So in a way, it's easier for him to make this threat' It is easy for former U.S. President Donald Trump to threaten that 'all hell will break loose' on Hamas because Israel will be the one to carry out that threat, according to former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Danny Ayalon. Speaking to ILTV News this week, Ayalon explained that Trump's warning does not require direct American action, such as deploying U.S. troops. 'The threat, if needed, will be materialized or realized by Israel. So in a way, it's easier for him to make this threat,' he said.

Is an Aliyah event key to making Israel your home?	If you're considering making Aliyah, attending a Nefesh B’Nefesh event could be the game-changer you need, according to Marc Rosenberg, vice president of Diaspora Partnerships at Nefesh B’Nefesh If you're considering making Aliyah, attending a Nefesh B’Nefesh event could be the game-changer you need, according to Marc Rosenberg, vice president of Diaspora Partnerships at Nefesh B’Nefesh. In an interview with ILTV News, Rosenberg emphasized that Nefesh B’Nefesh gatherings provide crucial support for Jews worldwide looking to move to Israel. In partnership with the Ministry of Aliyah and Integration and the Jewish Agency, the organization ensures a smooth transition for new immigrants—whether they need assistance with logistics, employment, or simply a boost of confidence. Currently, a series of events is taking place across North America, including specialized programs for medical professionals. Rosenberg explained how attending an Aliyah event could be the key to making Israel your home.

Global Jewish leaders unite in Israel for inaugural Voice of the ...	President Isaac Herzog: 'Our nation is ever challenged' Around 150 people from Jewish communities worldwide arrived in Israel this week for the first gathering of Voice of the People (VoP), a global initiative led by President Isaac Herzog to strengthen unity and empower Jewish communities. 'Our nation is ever challenged,' said Israeli President Isaac Herzog. 'The Jewish nation, the Jewish story, the story of Israel, the State of Israel, and the lack of knowledge and understanding of the challenges that each one of your respective communities faces, have to be told to one another.' Jewish Agency Chairman of the Board Marc Wilf emphasized the fresh perspectives and energy within the gathering. 'What I find here are people from all walks of life in the Jewish world, and I see a lot of new faces, a lot of innovative energy, and people that I don't necessarily know or have seen before, and so I think that's good.' The inaugural meeting, held in Haifa, marked the beginning of a collaborative effort to address key communal challenges, harness data-driven insights, and shape a shared vision for the Jewish future. 'It’s almost like the diplomatic version of the Startup Nation,' observed VoP delegate from London, Efrat Sopher. The delegation included 50 participants from Israel, 50 from North America, and 50 from other regions worldwide. Over five days, attendees engaged in meaningful discussions and developed actionable strategies to strengthen Jewish communities globally. The Voice of the People initiative aims to translate the ideas exchanged at the summit into concrete action. 'Who are we? And what is our voice?' asked Israeli VoP delegate Aleeza Ben-Sharlom. 'I think we are literally here to answer that question.' She elaborated, 'When we talk about Voice of the People, it’s ‘voice.’ We didn't say, ‘Voices’ of the People. We said, Voice of the People. We might live in different countries, we might speak different languages, and somehow we're supposed to have one voice and we're supposed to be unified.' Throughout the summit, key sessions focused on adaptive leadership, crisis resilience, and the role of technology and data in shaping the Jewish future. Prominent academics, analysts, government and diplomatic officials, and community leaders led discussions on security, combating antisemitism, strengthening Israel-Diaspora relations, fostering Jewish identity, and leveraging data for strategic decision-making. 'We have to make sure that we are strong together and that we know each other, respect each other, and break our heads together, bang our heads together, to come for solutions that are so important to the future of our people,' Herzog said. Sopher added, 'I hope that there'll be practical, very, very innovative solutions that haven't been considered before.' Beyond the discussions, the summit was also about embracing diversity and fostering hope for a better future—especially in the wake of the October 7 tragedy and nearly a year and a half of war. 'The Jewish people will persevere,' Wilf concluded. 'We need to be more in touch with our identity and our heritage. And I think when you come to a conference to voice the people, and you see all the great energy here, you feel very hopeful.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjdgakdjyg	2025-03-06T19:07:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/07/H1xx11x00sJg/H1xx11x00sJg_0_49_2048_1153_0_small.jpg
SpaceX loses control of Starship in space in testing failure	SpaceX lost contact with its Starship rocket in space on Thursday during the company's eighth test mission, dooming a satellite deployment demonstration in the company's second consecutive Starship failure this year. The 403-foot(123-meter)-tall rocket system lifted off at around 6:30 p.m. ET (2300 GMT) from SpaceX's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, rocket facilities, with its Super Heavy first stage booster returning back to land as planned. But minutes later, the Starship upper stage began to spin out of control in space, SpaceX's live stream showed. A visualization of the rocket's engines showed multiple shutdowns before the company confirmed it had lost contact with the ship.

New IDF chief approves Gaza attack plans as Israel prepares for e...	IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir approved new attack plans on his first day in office; As Hamas continues to regroup, Israeli assessments indicate that once military operations resume, they will be difficult to halt; Meanwhile, IDF forces are expected to face operational restrictions in the field, while Hamas has learned from previous battles and reinforced its defenses. New IDF Chief of Staff, Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir approved new offensive plans for the Southern Command in preparation for a likely resumption of fighting against Hamas in Gaza. Hamas has been using the cease-fire to reorganize and, according to various assessments, once hostilities resume the conflict could escalate rapidly and become difficult to contain. The IDF has informed Israel’s political leadership that any new offensive in Gaza will be subject to various operational constraints, primarily in areas where hostages are believed to be held. Over the past month, multiple IDF divisions, including reserve brigades, have been preparing for a ground offensive in Gaza, combined with heavy aerial strikes. Hamas has been reinforcing its positions in anticipation of renewed fighting following the collapse of the cease-fire’s first phase without negotiations for a second. The terror group is believed to have learned lessons from previous battles, planted dozens of new explosive devices, redeployed thousands of operatives to Gaza City from the south, recalibrated rocket launchers, and restructured its combat units into companies and battalions. Zamir’s statement on Wednesday — that Hamas has yet to be decisively defeated, contradicting the stance of his predecessor, Herzi Halevi — has reinforced the military’s commitment to prolonged ground operations. The expectation is that these operations will continue for years until Hamas is militarily dismantled. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On his first day as chief of staff, Zamir entered Gaza and met with soldiers from the Netzah Yehuda Battalion. During a field tour with outgoing Southern Command Chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman and other senior commanders, Zamir urged troops to maintain full readiness. 'You must always be prepared, always stay alert, always be suspicious, and always keep training,' he told them Referring to their role in protecting Israeli civilians, he told the soldiers: 'If you look back, you’ll see the homes of Sderot — you are defending the residents of Sderot. You are our frontline defense. That gives you a great responsibility, and I trust you to fulfill your mission to the best of your ability. We have outstanding commanders, excellent soldiers, and we will accomplish all our missions in the best possible way.' Earlier in the day, Zamir also met with local leaders from Israeli communities near Gaza, telling them the IDF is preparing for a return to combat amid the fragile cease-fire. However, he stressed that 'bringing the hostages home remains our top priority.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1tlmndiyx	2025-03-06T15:09:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/rJ7hPDPikg/rJ7hPDPikg_0_0_2048_1354_0_small.jpg
The murder of the Bibas brothers is not mentioned in UN report on...	A draft of the UN’s annual report on children in conflict zones omits Israeli victims, including murdered siblings Kfir and Ariel Bibas and 12 children killed by a Hezbollah rocket in Majdal Shams; UN ambassador Danon: Report 'serves as a platform for baseless accusations against Israel' The draft of the UN's annual report on children in conflict zones, expected to be published in June 2025, continues to demonstrate imbalance and an anti-Israel tone. The report, for example, ignores the youngest Israeli victims of the war — failing to mention the names of Kfir and Ariel Bibas, who were murdered in captivity in Gaza and whose bodies were returned in the last hostage deal. Additionally, the 12 children killed by a Hezbollah rocket in Majdal Shams are not mentioned at all. The report inflates figures, includes unverified information, and blurs the responsibility of terror organizations for causing harm to children. The draft was shared with Israel for its comments, but Jerusalem was shocked by the UN's insensitivity and hypocrisy and decided not to cooperate with the report. Among other accusations, the report blames the IDF for using exactly 27 Palestinian children as 'human shields,' yet it only vaguely mentions Hamas' systematic use of civilians as human shields, without verifying specific cases. The report claims Israeli security forces 'kidnapped a Palestinian girl,' while simultaneously omitting the names of Kfir and Ariel Bibas. If that were not enough, the report does not state that the young siblings were murdered by their captors, instead merely saying they 'died in captivity.' Furthermore, the report blames Israel for harming children due to the impact of rocket interception fragments during Iranian missile launches toward Israel — without acknowledging the original source of the attack. On the topic of humanitarian aid, the UN places almost all responsibility on Israel while almost entirely ignoring the fact that Hamas itself damaged the crossings designated for aid transfers and, according to countless testimonies and evidence, also stole aid intended for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip for its own purposes. The report claims that 2,723 requests for aid were denied but downplays the fact that 5,327 requests - nearly twice as many - were approved. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Regarding the number of Palestinian casualties, the report presents thousands of deaths and injuries, many of which are unverified, creating a misleading impression of the scale of events. Responsibility for violations is placed almost entirely on Israel, while Hamas is not held accountable at all, and Hezbollah and Iran are given only marginal mentions in the biased report. The report also claims the IDF used schools and hospitals for military purposes in 10 different cases, but it mentions only one instance in which Hamas used civilian structures for military purposes — despite the well-documented fact that many 'innocent' buildings in Gaza were revealed to be bases for launching terror operations. The situation is no different in the reports on the northern front. In Lebanon, most of the harm to children is attributed to Israel, while Hezbollah is not mentioned at all as being responsible for any harm. Similarly, in Syria, Israeli actions are included in the total count of casualties, but — there is no mention of the 12 children killed in Majdal Shams. The UN 'verified' 8,555 serious violations against 2,960 children — only 15 of whom were Israeli children, while the rest were Palestinian children The draft also relies on unverified data that portrays Israel in a negative light while minimizing the severity of violations committed by terror organizations. According to the draft, which was shared with Israel, the UN 'verified' 8,555 serious violations against 2,960 children — only 15 of whom were Israeli children, while the rest were Palestinian children. Most of the cases occurred in Gaza, with thousands in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Additionally, 2,788 'serious violations' were verified for 2023 in Gaza, compared to only one 'serious violation' in Israel. Furthermore, the UN received reports of the deaths of 4,230 children in Gaza in 2024, for which the verification process is still ongoing. Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, responded sharply to the biased report, saying: 'We will not cooperate with a report that serves as a platform for baseless accusations against Israel. The Secretary-General once again chooses to blatantly ignore the harm done to Israeli children — as far as he’s concerned, our lives are worth less and don’t deserve to be included in this report. We will not let diplomatic terrorism prevail.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h15gk5vije	2025-03-06T14:40:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/06/BJbpKwJvvR/BJbpKwJvvR_0_293_961_541_0_small.jpg
Trump says he will go to Saudi Arabia to reach $1 trillion deal	I t for Riyadh to invest upwards of $1 trillion in the U.S. economy, including purchases of military equipment. Talking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said he would probably travel there in the next month and a half. He noted that the first overseas trip of his first term was to Riyadh in 2017 to announce Saudi investments estimated then to be worth $350 billion. He said that, at his behest, the Saudis were willing to invest $1 trillion over four years in American companies including purchases of U.S. military equipment. 'And they've agreed to do that, so I'm going to be going there, and I have a great relationship with them, and they've been very nice,' Trump said. Saudi Arabia has been taking a more prominent role in U.S. foreign policy. Trump's Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff told reporters the Saudis will host a U.S.-Ukraine meeting next week to discuss a ceasefire in the Ukraine war. In February, Trump met with officials of the PGA Tour and the Saudi-owned LIV Golf about resolving a rift between the two. Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and Middle East adviser during his first term, started a private equity firm that received $2 billion in Saudi investment after Trump left office. Trump has also recently presided over a string of announcements about companies investing heavily in the U.S. economy including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Apple.

Haredi lawmakers tell Netanyahu what without draft exemption law ...	Members of the Haredi Agudat Israel Knesset faction, Yitzhak Goldknopf, minister of Housing and Construction, Yaakov Tesler, and Moshe Shimon Roth, wrote a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the issue of exempting yeshiva students from compulsory military service. In their letter, they noted the clause in the coalition agreement in which the Netanyahu pledged to regulate the status of yeshiva students even before the 2023 budget. The letter clarified that 'the claim of a delay due to the war is not valid, as the Likud has returned to promoting legal reform.' They concluded their letter with the announcement that, in accordance with the instruction of their rabbis, they will vote against the budget as long as the status of yeshiva students is not regulated.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hki1tipi1e	2025-03-06T14:19:23-08:00	
Trump is fed up': US talks with Hamas and the American timetable...	Fears of the cease-fire deal's collapse are growing and Trump is losing patience after meeting with returned hostages; 'We are having discussions with Hamas. We are helping Israel in those discussions,' Trump told reporters; Witkoff clarified: 'We don't think Hamas has acted sensibly so far' There is definitely a deadline for returning to fighting in the Gaza Strip, according to President Donald Trump's Mideast envoy, 'but I'm not at liberty to discuss it,' he told White House reporters on Thursday. Steve Wtikoff's statements come a day after Trump issued another threat to Hamas about facing 'hell to pay' if the terrorist organization does not release the hostages. Witkoff repeated those words on Thursday, saying that 'it is time for Hamas to start acting in a responsible and reasonable way.' Later on Thursday Trump confirmed the talks with Hamas, saying: 'We are having discussions with Hamas. We are helping Israel in those discussions.' Amid fears of a return to fighting, and in light of the terrorist organization's threats that such and escalation it 'will lead to the deaths of hostages,' Witkoff told reporters outside the White House that there is a deadline by which Israel will indeed return to action in the Strip. 'Trump was clear on the matter, we don't think Hamas has acted sensibly so far,' he noted. He also commented on the direct contacts the United States is holding with Hamas, that bypasses Israel, and said that the release of the American hostages, both alive and dead, is the administration's top priority. 'Eden Alexander is very important to us, as all the hostages are, but Eden Alexander is an American, and he's injured, and so he's a top priority for us,' Witkoff said. A day after the talks were revealed, Witkoff noted that Adam Boehler, the president's envoy for hostages, had indeed held talks with Hamas. 'We feel that Hamas has not been forthright with us, and it's time for them to be forthright with us,' Witkoff said, adding that the release of Edan Alexander would be a 'very important signal.' Witkoff said that it was President Trump's meeting with the freed hostages on Wednesday that led him to the message he conveyed on Truth Social. 'The president has issued a statement about what's acceptable to him and what's not, and hopefully we'll see some good conduct next week, and I'll be able to go in there and have discussions,' he said. After the cease-fire deal in its current form collapsed, Witkoff was asked if the framework of the agreement still exists. 'I don't want to put words in (Trump's) mouth, but I think it's, it's fairly clear he was saying, I've had enough. Like there's a lot of mistreatment. There's a lot of conversation among these hostages about the deprivation that they went through about murders that they saw, and I think that the president listened to it, absorbed it, and said this, it's unacceptable. I'm not going to tolerate this type of behavior,' he said. Witkoff spoke about the moving meeting held Wednesday night with the returned hostages. 'The president spent about an hour with the survivors of the captivity yesterday, taking pictures and listening to their stories. He was moved by it and I think they felt a tremendous sense of liberation that they were able to talk about the feelings they experienced,' he noted. 'To talk about other hostages who were in captivity with them and the need to bring them all home.' He said that Trump 'ended up spending about an hour with them, with each of the hostages pictures, and spent a lot of time listening to their stories about what happened to them in captivity. And he was clearly emotional about it. I think that they felt a really great sense of catharsis that they got to tell the president about their experience, talk about other hostages who they spent time with while they were in captivity, and the need to get them all home. And that led to his post last night. So I describe it as a very, very important day for them. I think they all went home feeling that they got a great sense of closure, at least in part.' The State Department, on the other hand, cooled the air surrounding the reports of direct contacts between the U.S and Hamas, saying that not every conversation is a 'negotiation.' In light of these remarks, a senior Israeli official familiar with the details told Ynet Thursday that there will not be a separate American move, but rather a combination of the return of the American hostages in a broader move. 'The chances of its success depend on Israel's flexibility and the U.S.'s determination to apply pressure on the parties,' he said. 'Trump talked all day about the freed hostages' President Trump's meeting with the eight returned hostages reportedly touched his heart deeply. Sources familiar with the matter said that the returnees managed to create a very strong emotional connection with Trump and that he talked about the meeting all day and thought about them all day. People who spoke to White House officials also got the impression that Trump intends to allocate the most resources to addressing the issue. The survivors' delegation included Noa Argamani , Doron Steinbrecher, Eli Sharabi, Naama Levy, Iair Horn, Omer Shem Tov, and Keith and Aviva Siegel. After the meeting, Trump called on Hamas to immediately release all hostages held in Gaza in what he called his 'last warning' to them while also urging the terror group's leadership to leave the Palestinian enclave. Trump posted on Truth Social: 'This is your last warning! For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance. Also, to the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD!' Trump said there will be 'hell to pay later' if hostages are not released. On Thursday evening, Hamas' military wing spokesman Abu Obeida issued his own threat in response, stating that an escalation by Israel and a return to fighting would lead to the deaths of hostages. Abu Obaida claimed Hamas is 'prepared for any scenario' and stated that the organization 'committed to the world and the mediators to uphold the terms of the cease-fire and the exchange of prisoners. Despite all of Israel's attempts to evade the agreement, we chose to continue honoring it.' He went on to accuse Israel of attempting to avoid fulfilling the stages of the agreement, saying: 'The enemy leadership is trying to evade the deal, seeking American cover to carry out aggression against our people.' The families of the hostages onThursday urged the negotiating teams, the Americans and the Israelis, to work toward the release of the hostages, all at the same time and without distinguishing between them. 'We urge the negotiators to reach an agreement on the release of all 59 hostages together, not in a trickle that will leave dozens of hostages to languish in Hamas' tunnels of horror for many more months,' the Hostage Families Forum said. 'We have seen the situation of the freed ones, it is not going to get better. Dealing with Hamas can always be done, the release of the hostages must be done immediately.' The talks behind Israel's back: 'A new era' Adam Boehler , Trump's envoy for hostage issues, has been talking to Hamas leaders for the past three weeks about the release of the American hostages. At least that's what emerged on Thursday, a day after the talks behind Israel's back were revealed. The test of the outcome will be whether Phase II of the cease-fire deal is implemented or at least whether there is a gesture from Hamas regarding Edan Alexander, who holds American citizenship, as well as the return of the bodies of four dead Israeli American hostages: Omer Neutra, Itay Chen, Gadi Haggai and Judi Weinstein Haggai - but for now, whether the cease-fire will continue is unclear. 'The president asked me if there was any work I wanted to focus on,' Boehler said on Thursday. 'I told him that this (the issue of the hostages) is the only thing, because I think there is nothing more important to this country, that even if the citizens are abroad, the country has their back.' According to him, 'President Trump has made this issue a top priority. You saw what he said yesterday to Hamas, that kidnapping an American citizen or any other citizen is inappropriate and will be responded to in the harshest way possible.' He added: 'I have worked directly with the president, with Secretary of State Rubio and with National Security Adviser Waltz, to make sure that our policy is 100% focused on bringing people back. The president has no problem acting, we all back him, we are beginning a new era where it is unacceptable to detain American citizens.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The White House claimed to have consulted with Israel about the direct talks it had held with Hamas - but an Israeli official denied this. The New York Times reported that Israel did not learn about the talks from the United States, but from what was described as 'other channels.' Sources familiar with the matter told Ynet Thursday that 'there is a dynamic here that Netanyahu does not recognize and does not control. After all, there is no scenario where America releases its citizens without also releasing other hostages. Israel tried to claim that there is no second phase and that it is not prepared to enter into negotiations with Hamas, but here is the American administration that says: I will talk directly with Hamas and try to get the negotiations moving.' Israeli sources familiar with the details noted that: 'We don't know everything, but the feeling is that something is brewing between the administration and Hamas. The Americans are determined to release more hostages, they understand that a return to fighting and a ground operation is very bad news for the hostages, and they are prepared to go to places their predecessors have not gone. There is incredible determination and wonderful commitment here.' 'This is not a government that works normally,' a source who is in contact with the government told Ynet. 'It works very creatively and breaks all the rules, is not bound by any considerations.' This requires mental flexibility on the part of those conducting the negotiations, and they have this flexibility, a source said. 'Witkoff's team is very strong and active, a lot of things are happening below the surface.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy3fofpjkl	2025-03-06T13:47:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/BkKUHcDYJe/BkKUHcDYJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
