Ex-hostage Amit Soussana: 'I fought off many men'	After receiving a special award for sharing her sexual assault experience, captivity survivor says she understands the strength and determination needed to fight this battle Amit Soussana, a survivor of Hamas captivity who bravely shared her experience of sexual assault during her ordeal, was honored with a special award from the Michal Sela Forum for her groundbreaking efforts in the fight against sexual violence. Soussana, 40, a lawyer at Luzzatto & Luzzatto, was kidnapped on October 7 and released after 55 days of captivity in Gaza. Upon receiving the award, Soussana said, 'I chose to speak about the trauma I endured. I wanted justice for the women and men who have been hurt, justice for our country and justice for myself. I couldn’t bear the denial.' 'After sharing my story, many women reached out to me, sharing their own experiences. We, women, are the stronger sex—we just need a more balanced playing field. This is the strength of this forum, which seeks solutions to prevent violence. I fought off many men; I know how much determination and willpower are required in this battle. My struggle may have been lost from the start, but that's not the case for this forum. I thank you for your valuable work.' In her harrowing testimony, which was published after her release in a hostage-prisoner swap with Hamas in November, Soussana described how, days after being abducted from her home in Kfar Aza, one of her captors—an armed Hamas terrorist named Mohammed—began asking her about her sex life. She was held alone in a children's room, which she recalled was covered in posters of the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants, chained at her ankle. According to her, her captor would sleep in an adjacent room, often entering while only wearing underwear, sometimes sitting on her bed, lifting her shirt and touching her.

When her period ended around October 18, she tried to avoid being assaulted by pretending her period was still ongoing, even for an entire week. The severe sexual assault occurred several days later, around October 24, when her captor freed her from her chains and insisted that she take a shower. After resisting, he took her to the kitchen, showing her a pot of boiling water on the stove, before leading her to the bathroom, where he forced her to pour the hot water on herself. After washing for several minutes, she heard him calling her from the door, demanding she hurry. As she turned around, she saw him standing there with a weapon. She tried to cover herself with a towel, but he struck her. 'Amit, Amit, take it off,' he demanded, and she was forced to comply, with the weapon in his hand. 'He pushed me onto the edge of the bathtub. I closed my legs and resisted. He continued hitting me, placing his weapon in my face, then dragged me to the bedroom,' she recalled. After the assault, he took a shower, leaving her naked in the dark. When he returned, she said he showed remorse, saying, 'I’m bad, I’m bad. Please don’t tell Israel.' She explained that after the assault, she feared being attacked again at any moment. 'You can’t look at him, but you must. He’s the one guarding you, you’re with him—and you know it could happen again at any moment. You’re completely dependent on him.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syvziomjke	2025-03-03T11:33:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/03/Syj11qcDmi1e/Syj11qcDmi1e_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu warns Hamas of ‘unimaginable consequences’ if hostages ...	PM vows to continue war until Hamas dismantled and all hostages returned, accuses opposition of echoing Hamas rhetoric, defends hostage negotiations and credits Trump for supporting voluntary migration from Gaza Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Monday that Israel will not stop its military campaign in Gaza until Hamas is completely dismantled and all hostages are returned, warning the terror group of 'consequences they cannot imagine' if captives are not released. 'We are preparing for the next stages of the war—on seven fronts,' Netanyahu said during a parliamentary debate, adding, 'We will not stop until we achieve total victory—returning all our hostages, destroying Hamas’ military and governing power and ensuring Gaza is no longer a threat to Israel.' Netanyahu also addressed ongoing hostage negotiations and the proposal by U.S. mediator Steve Witkoff, saying Israel was not violating any agreements but remained prepared to resume fighting if necessary. 'His proposal provides a path to bringing all the hostages home,' Netanyahu said. 'I tell Hamas—if you don’t release our hostages, there will be consequences you cannot imagine.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The prime minister credited U.S. President Donald Trump for supporting a voluntary migration plan for Gazans, claiming that many had already left the territory. 'It’s time to give the residents of Gaza a real choice—the freedom to leave and the freedom to choose,' he said. Netanyahu also lashed out at the opposition, accusing them of spreading 'false briefings' that, he claimed, strengthen Hamas' resolve and harm hostage negotiations. 'You claim we are sabotaging deals? That’s a complete lie,' he said. 'You are echoing Hamas' messages, making them harden their stance, which only hurts the hostages.' Addressing recent speculation about his health, Netanyahu said he was in good condition and dismissed political attacks as 'orchestrated campaigns' aimed at undermining his leadership. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjwd00k7sjl	2025-03-03T10:59:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/03/rySR3BXokx/rySR3BXokx_167_271_1033_582_0_small.jpg

According to family, Angrest, captured while critically wounded, is enduring severe mistreatment in captivity, including torture during interrogations and held under 'inhumane conditions' The parents of Matan Angrest, an Israeli soldier who was abducted wounded and unconscious from his tank at the Nahal Oz military base on October 7, released the first footage of him in captivity on Monday evening. 'We demand that the Israeli government implement all stages of the hostage deal before moving on to the next phase of the war,' his mother, Anat, said. She stressed the urgency of securing his release, stating, 'Matan is in mortal danger. All the hostages must be brought home before more soldiers are sent to battle and don’t return.'

The family also said that Angrest was excluded from the recent humanitarian release 'solely because he is an Israeli soldier.' Less than a month ago, Angrest’s father, Hagai, said the family received confirmation that he was alive through freed hostages. The accounts, which surfaced six months after Angrest appeared in a propaganda video from Gaza, indicated that he remains severely injured and is being held in harsh conditions. 'We heard from released hostages that our beloved son Matan is alive. It was incredibly emotional for us,' his father said. 'The time has come to bring him back, along with all the others. We expect Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to advance the second phase of the deal immediately. We all saw the horrific images—scenes of a Holocaust in 2025, here in Israel. Bring Matan and the rest of the hostages home now.

Don't want to live in an Islamic state': Syrian Druze plead for ...	Druze resident of Jaramana, near Damascus, says community 'wants Israel to intervene before it’s too late,' describing dire conditions, with no water or electricity, while locals stay up at nights to protect their families Amid ongoing clashes between armed Druze militias and Syrian government forces in the city of Jaramana, near Damascus, a local Druze resident described the situation as 'extremely difficult' and urged Israel to intervene 'as soon as possible.' The plea follows warnings from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz against Syria’s new Islamist regime, led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, saying Israel will not tolerate any harm to the Druze population. According to the resident, the unrest stemmed from 'isolated incidents' that escalated citywide. He welcomed Israel’s warnings to the Syrian government, saying, 'We don’t want to live in an Islamic state, and the situation here doesn’t allow us to.' He described dire conditions, with residents lacking water and electricity, relying on bottled drinking water, and staying up at night to protect their families. Jaramana’s Druze community is particularly vulnerable. Unlike Druze populations in southern Syria, which are more independent and better armed, those in Jaramana—living in a mixed Druze-Christian area near Damascus—have limited means of self-defense. Following the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime, Israel warned of a possible power struggle in the region, placing it under close observation. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The resident claimed that Syria’s new leadership provides financial aid only to Sunni Muslim communities, leaving Druze residents without support. 'We want Israel to intervene before it’s too late,' he said, stressing the desire for peace. Regarding Syria’s broader instability, he added, 'As long as the country remains unstable, unrest will continue. The situation could worsen. If a decisive resolution is not reached for the Syrian people and the southern region, disorder will persist.' However, not all Druze in Jaramana share this view. Rabea Manzar, a local resident, told Al-Jazeera, 'We are Arab-Syrians, we are connected to our land, and we didn’t ask for protection from anyone. The Syrian government will respond to Netanyahu’s threats.' After days of tension, cautious calm has returned to Jaramana, with security forces loyal to the new regime deploying in the city. Local sources reported that negotiations were underway between city leaders and security officials over the surrender of weapons and the arrest of suspects linked to the recent killings of two security officers. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk4bdv7syl	2025-03-03T09:45:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/22/BJmudgIS1x/BJmudgIS1x_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Dore Gold, veteran Israeli diplomat and ex-Netanyahu advisor, die...	Known for his academic expertise and diplomatic impact, the former Israeli UN ambassador played a key role in shaping Israel’s foreign policy and global relations for decades Dore Gold—a former Foreign Ministry director-general, political advisor to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's ambassador to the United Nations—passed away on Monday at the age of 71. Born in Hartford, Connecticut, Gold received his primary education at Hartford Yeshiva and later attended the prestigious Mount Hermon private high school in northern Massachusetts. He pursued his academic studies at Columbia University, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in Islamic Studies in 1975. He obtained a master’s degree in Political Science a year later and completed his Ph.D. in 1984. Gold studied classical Arabic, and his doctoral dissertation, which focused on Saudi Arabia, served as the basis for his book Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism. The book, which appeared on The New York Times bestseller list, argued that Saudi Arabia actively funds terrorist organizations and supports the enemies of the United States. Gold immigrated to Israel in 1980 and served in the IDF. After his discharge in 1983, he embarked on an academic career, serving as a senior research fellow at the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University. Later, he served as head of the project on U.S. Foreign and Security Policy at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, under the direction of Maj. Gen. (res.) Aharon Yariv. In 1991, Gold served as one of the advisors to the Israeli delegation at the Madrid Peace Conference and the subsequent Washington talks. During this period, he became close to Benjamin Netanyahu and served as his political advisor, a role he continued to fulfill when Netanyahu was elected prime minister. Gold played a key role in establishing ties between the Likud Party leadership and Jordan’s Hashemite Kingdom as a counterbalance to the strategic connections established between the Labor Party-led government and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), headed by Yasser Arafat. Gold accompanied Netanyahu in his meetings with Jordanian leaders between 1994 and 1995 in London, Amman and Aqaba. In his role as Netanyahu’s political advisor following his 1996 election victory, Gold conducted negotiations with the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, Jordan, Syria and other Arab actors. Among his notable contributions was his involvement in drafting the Hebron Agreement's annexes, which focused on mutual obligations between Israel and the Palestinians. French journalist Charles Enderlin noted that Gold extracted a commitment from then-U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher ensuring that the 'deposit' promised by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin regarding the future of the Golan Heights would not bind the State of Israel. This effort also secured a new American commitment from the Clinton administration to the 1975 letter from President Gerald Ford, which declared that the United States would give significant weight to Israel’s retention of the Golan Heights. From 1997 to 1999, Gold served as Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations. In 1998, he was part of the Israeli delegation to the Wye River Memorandum, which involved Israel, the Palestinian Authority and then-U.S. President Bill Clinton. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Between 2000 and 2023, Gold served as president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, a think tank that focuses on policy studies and issues central to the State of Israel and the Jewish people. Between 2001 and 2003, he served as an advisor to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and was particularly involved in the Aqaba Summit, which included then-U.S. President George W. Bush. During this period, Gold frequently appeared in American media as a spokesperson for Sharon’s government. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu eulogized him: 'My wife Sara and I are deeply saddened by the passing of Dr. Dore Gold—a prolific academic researcher, a brilliant Israeli diplomat and a close personal friend. For over three decades, Dore accompanied me as a dedicated public servant of unparalleled caliber. Dore, with his exceptional talents, served as a political advisor, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, and director-general of the Foreign Ministry. He possessed unique intellectual integrity, a remarkable ability to get things done and a deep love for the State of Israel. 'Added to this were his passionate Zionist vision and sharp analytical skills, which bore fruit for Israel in the international arena. One clear example, among many, is his contribution to achieving the Abraham Accords with Arab states. His insightful books clearly present the just path of the State of Israel. Dore will be missed by our country, and he will be personally missed by me and my wife. Sara and I extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Orit, and his family.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkaa8f7iyg	2025-03-03T09:27:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/10/28/9562694/9562694_1_111_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Police detain driver who plowed at high speed into a group of people but have not confirmed a motive; authorities urge the public to avoid the area amid ongoing investigations A car drove into a crowd of people in the western German city of Mannheim on Monday, killing at least one person, injuring several others, and overshadowing carnival celebrations in the region where police had been on alert for security attacks. The car's driver was detained, a police spokesperson said, adding that it was unclear whether there were other suspects. Police have appealed to the public to stay away from the city center. People were seen lying on the ground at the scene and at least two were being resuscitated, an eyewitness told Reuters. Bild newspaper reported that two people were killed and 25 injured, citing security sources. It was unclear whether the driver acted deliberately or if there was any connection to Germany's carnival celebrations, which culminated on Rose Monday with a number of parades, although not in Mannheim, which held its main event on Sunday. A black car drove at high speed into a group of people, travelling from the centrally located Paradeplatz square towards the city's landmark water tower, the Mannheim24 news website reported.

‘They talk to his picture’: Hostages' children struggle with fath...	Nearly 18 months after their fathers were kidnapped by Hamas, children face ongoing uncertainty, emotional distress; experts say children are indirect terror victims, denied fundamental rights under international law Nearly a year and a half after their fathers were kidnapped by Hamas, the hostages' children are still living in uncertainty, not knowing when or if they will see them again. For these families, every day is a battle to hold on to hope, even as time passes and answers remain out of reach. Among those waiting is four-year-old Re'em David. His father, Elkana Bohbot, was taken captive on October 7. His mother, Rivka, describes the daily struggle to keep him hopeful. 'What does it mean to live without a father? It means telling my son every day that Daddy will come back, so he doesn’t lose hope,' she said. 'It means explaining that people are looking for him, listening when he cries that he misses him. When he sees a plane in the sky, he asks, ‘Bring my daddy back.’ He’s afraid to be left alone, afraid that I will ‘go to Gaza’ too. He feels his father’s absence in everything.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Despite his young age, Re'em holds onto his father’s memory. 'He says, ‘I love summer like Daddy. I like warm water like Daddy.’ He even saves up money for him, convinced that someone must have stolen his father’s wallet. On Family Day at kindergarten, he drew us—Elkana in bright colors, and the rest of us in black and white, because he knows we are sad.' But Rivka refuses to let go of hope. 'I know Elkana is holding on. He knows he has a wife fighting for him, a son waiting for him. He will be shocked to see how much his child has grown. No one will take my hope away.' Lishay Miran-Lavi faces a similar struggle with her daughters, Roni and Alma. Their father, Omri Miran, was kidnapped before their eyes. 'I do everything I can to make sure my daughters live with joy, despite the pain,' she said. 'But the reality is that Roni and Alma were also hostages. They saw their father taken from them, and it left deep scars. Roni is three and a half, and she constantly talks about her father. She remembers every detail of that day, who was there, why they came.' 'Alma never even got to know him. She was only six months old when she lost the basic right to grow up with her father. And in a way, they are still stuck in that day,' Lishay said. 'But I tell myself, and I know—Omri will come back, on his own two feet. There is no other option. We must bring him home. He has two daughters waiting for him. We must bring them all home.' Children's rights are being violated Legal experts argue that beyond the emotional toll, these children’s rights are being systematically violated under international law. A new legal document submitted by Prof. Dana Pugach and attorney Sheli Aviv-Yani highlights how the hostage crisis has deprived these children of their fundamental protections. 'The impact on these children is not just emotional—it represents a continuous breach of their basic rights,' the document states, citing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and other international treaties. It asserts that Israel has a legal obligation to recognize these children’s rights and prioritize them in efforts to secure the hostages’ release. 'This is not just a matter of sympathy or compassion,' said Prof. Pugach. 'It is a concrete legal duty of the state to protect these children, who have become indirect victims of terrorism. The rights of these children must be at the forefront of negotiations.' Pugach noted that hostages are often categorized into different groups—women, the elderly, the sick, and others—but the fathers of young children have not received enough attention. 'After nearly a year and a half in captivity, none of the hostages are in good health. But certain groups require special focus, such as fathers with young children,' she said. 'There must be a clear message—any deal to bring them home must also consider the rights of their families, especially their children.' While international law strongly protects children’s rights, Pugach said, the responsibility to uphold them does not lie with Hamas, but with Israel and the global community. 'My expectation is not that Hamas will suddenly recognize children’s rights,' she said. 'It is that Israel will uphold its obligation to these children, and that the international community will acknowledge the need to protect their interests. These legal efforts are also a way for families to reclaim some control over a situation that has left them feeling powerless.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkbyai7jyl	2025-03-03T08:57:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/02/yk14279908/yk14279908_0_140_676_381_0_small.jpg

Lone guard, breached fence, abandoned posts: IDF probe reveals Na...	On October 7, just one soldier guarded Nahal Oz base, a stone's throw from Gaza, as forces were thin, tank crews off standby and machine guns locked away; seized Hamas manual shows terror group knew base's security gaps, aiding 250 terrorists in its takeover An IDF investigation report released Monday exposed a chain of systematic failures in military norms in the Nahal Oz base, which Hamas was able to exploit to deliver a well-coordinated blow on October 7. The large military base, located a few hundred yards from the Gaza border, was not drilled for an attack; tank crews were told not to be on standby for their tanks; defense positions facing Shijaiyah were empty, and only one soldier, a sentry, was guarding the entire base—these are some of the disastrous initial conditions that contributed to the rapid collapse of the base. Intelligence gathered from the Gaza Strip during the war revealed a Hamas attack manual for the Nahal Oz base. According to senior IDF officials, it wouldn’t be out of place in an elite unit’s operation file, detailing all the base's weaknesses and characteristics: the gaps in the fence through which 60 Nukhba terrorists infiltrated during the first wave, ultimately taking the base within half an hour; the holes in the western wall, which were used as firing slits for gunmen to shoot crossfire at the soldiers inside; a reckless IDF procedure that approved reducing combat forces by about half on weekends so soldiers could enjoy time off at home; precise locations of every room, command center, office, and building within the camp; daily life routines; the number of weapons; the exact location of the bomb shelters, and more. Hamas knew it would be relatively easy to infiltrate the base. Its perimeter watch towers were not only empty and lacking machine guns (which were locked in storage), but the base also lacked significant trenches and obstacles. The investigation reveals that no military routine was maintained at the base, which housed several units, each in a different corner: no formations, no ceremonies, no daily briefings, and no posts. According to various testimonies, Hamas even built a model of Nahal Oz in Gaza to train for its conquest, understanding that if they took it and the other four battalion and brigade bases in the area, the way to murder and kidnap in southern Israeli towns would be quick and easy, as it turned out to be. The result was the loss of 53 soldiers at the Nahal Oz base: 22 combat support soldiers, including 16 lookouts, 31 fighters, including 19 from the Golani Brigade, and 10 who were kidnapped to Gaza. Every second was filmed, every angle documented The investigation, conducted over ten months by a team led by Colonel A., the commander of the IDF’s 551 Paratroopers Reserve Brigade, uncovered strange contradictions in the after-action reports of the units that operated at the base that Saturday. To uncover the truth, he organized all the data, communications, and hours of recorded footage. Colonel A.'s life was relatively easy, despite the differing testimonies of the survivors. He had almost every moment at the base captured on video. He received footage from Hamas terrorists’ GoPro cameras, drones used by the terrorist organization, armored vehicle cameras, and security cameras. One of the videos lasted an hour and 50 minutes, from when the attacker turned on the camera at 6:00 a.m. as he aimed his weapon in the Shijaiyah neighborhood until the attack ended and he returned to Gaza, along with about half of the Nukhba terrorists who had infiltrated the base. The IDF said the investigation was harder for Colonel A. than any of the battles or experiences he went through in his 20 years of service with the IDF's Shayetet 13 naval commando unit, even harder than the moments when he lost 20 of his soldiers during the war. Unlike other investigators, and against a backdrop of poor command climate, Colonel A. recommended personal measures, possibly even dismissals, against the senior officers responsible for the Nahal Oz debacle. His recommendations have not yet been accepted due to outgoing Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi's decision to leave the decisions to his successor, Major General Itzik Tzukrel. Even the commander of the northern brigade on October 7, Colonel Haim Cohen, who was responsible for the faulty operational management of the base before the war, remained in his position until recently, when he announced he would step down. 'The story of the fall of Nahal Oz could easily be linked to the long-standing failures that strengthened Hamas, the intelligence failure to provide warning, and the large-scale attack that included dozens of combat points,' said an IDF source. 'But in reality, the events there revealed something else: a shift in operational culture in recent years.' Hamas' goal: Capture in 15 minutes On the morning of October 7, there were 162 soldiers at the Nahal Oz base—about half the usual number on weekdays—according to a policy implemented by the IDF General Staff five years ago to accommodate soldiers’ preferences, based on the assumption that terrorists would only strike on weekdays. Of these soldiers, 81 were fighters, 91 carried weapons, and the rest were combat support personnel, including spotters from the Northern Brigade, medics, drivers, and logistics and armament soldiers. The night before the invasion, two separate breaches were detected in the security fence, just a few hundred yards from the base, which is one of the closest to the border. The update was sent at 4:00 a.m. to the Northern Brigade and the division, which were focused on nighttime assessments due to signs of an impending threat from the Gaza Strip. These signs, however, were not passed down to the Border Defense Battalions in order to avoid compromising intelligence sources. The breach in the fence was not fully analyzed, and according to the investigation team, it likely wasn’t linked to the upcoming invasion. However, it did lead to increased caution, and the forces were instructed to delay their morning patrol to verify no further infiltration at the border. Hamas’s operational plan to capture the Nahal Oz base, found in a document in Jabalia, reveals the sources from which Hamas gathered information about the base. These included not only drones launched intermittently but also hundreds of photos and videos uploaded by soldiers to social media from within the base itself, as well as media reports by the IDF about frequent changes in defense strategies in the sector. 'Hamas knew where every commander slept, where the dining hall was, which sections of the agricultural roads leading from the fence to the base could slow them down, and determined in their plan that the Nukhba battalions attacking the base had to do so within 15 minutes to ensure its capture,' the investigation report states. 'Hamas analyzed that it would take 15 minutes for a tank to reach Nahal Oz in case of an event. They monitored drills to determine how long it would take for nearby forces to reinforce. They understood they also had to neutralize the nearby Pega outpost, as it housed mortar positions supporting Nahal Oz, which they successfully did.' The base was divided in advance, with each Nukhba unit assigned to capture a specific area. The first wave, between 6:30 and 7:00 a.m., included 65 of Hamas' best fighters, and another 50 joined the second wave by 9:00 a.m. By 10:00 a.m., 100 more terrorists joined, completing the capture, killing, and kidnapping operations. At the height of the invasion, about 250 Hamas terrorists were inside the Nahal Oz base, which had a perimeter of only 1,200 meters. The commander of the Nukhba platoon was killed early in the battle, but his force continued according to plan. Half of the infiltrating terrorists were killed, while the rest managed to return to Gaza. The Hamas force was well-equipped, and in addition to their numerical advantage, they had a deadly arsenal: while the IDF saw no need to regularly distribute fragmentation grenades or mortar grenades to its soldiers, and machine guns were locked away in storage, Hamas arrived with numerous RPGs, explosive devices of various types, Kalashnikov rifles, and more. An investigation into the first Nukhba platoon’s conduct revealed further intelligence failures. The evening before, starting around 6:00 p.m., the Nukhba platoon had been briefed for the invasion plan. First, the commanders were briefed, followed by the terrorists. All of this occurred in Shijaiyah, an area that should have been covered by the IDF's Gaza Division’s Combat Intelligence Battalion. Yet, no one noticed the activity just one or two kilometers from the border. The second Nukhba platoon that infiltrated the base came from the Al-Furkan neighborhood, a bit deeper into Gaza City. The investigation found that the entry of Golani's 13th Battalion into the area was relatively smooth. Four months before the massacre, a brigade-level drill had included scenarios such as a Nukhba platoon raiding the nearby Pega outpost and an attack on a combat team by a Hamas drone. However, the scenario of an attack on the base itself was never practiced, even though, as noted, the base was only a 15-minute jog from the hostile Shijaiyah neighborhood, less than a kilometer from the border, and fully exposed to Gaza due to the area's topography. Despite the Nukhba raid scenarios discussed by the Gaza Division the year prior to the war, no one thought it necessary to drill Nahal Oz soldiers. Accordingly, as mentioned, the base was guarded by only one soldier at a sentry post and a few others guarding internal sections of the base, mainly to prevent theft, including a section with damaged observation balloons. The standby unit assigned to protect the entire base consisted of a platoon commander and three soldiers. Control at Nahal Oz had been lax even before October 7, despite inspections that seemingly had no effect. It took Colonel A.’s team four full months to compile a basic unit roster of the soldiers at the base as of 6:29 a.m. This indicates just how far basic norms had deteriorated at this front-line, threatened base. 'This base is right across from the kibbutz, and the civilian atmosphere had a negative impact,' the investigators noted. 'Golani’s battalion worked hard during this period, but was focused on the disturbances at the border. On Friday afternoon (October 6), it was once again stationed along the border, reinforced slightly by snipers from the Paratroopers’ reconnaissance unit and the counter-terrorism unit, but pulled back in the late afternoon because the border was unusually quiet and empty.' The shift in the IDF’s operational culture worsened with the change in standard operating procedures known to every soldier in the army until a decade or two ago in border areas: readiness at dawn. Under this procedure, all soldiers are expected to wake up and prepare to defend their post or sector, understanding that these are the most volatile hours, between the dark of night and the first light of dawn. This procedure, it turns out, was modified and contracted so that only the command posts and standby platoons performed it with the sector patrol. One of Golani’s platoon commanders, who waited at 5:30 a.m. at the base junction for a platoon from his unit to join in carrying out the procedure, angrily sent them back to base for being late. Another small unit didn’t wake up at all, according to the investigation. At 6:29 a.m., with the first barrage of fire, Golani company commander Maj. Shilo Har-Even, who was killed in action, shouted, 'This is not a drill. We’re under fire. Iron Dome interceptions. Purple rain.' 'Purple rain' is a code used in IDF operations that originated during the security zone in southern Lebanon, instructing soldiers to take positions at a post, understanding that a barrage of mortar shells could signal the start of a ground assault. Purple rain in 2023 in the IDF was primarily a reference to the Red Alert system. A video from a soldier’s phone at 6:30 a.m. showed Golani fighters laughing inside a bomb shelter in a relatively calm atmosphere. Some were still in their sleepwear, and one officer, wearing only a vest, followed the unfolding events on his radio while waiting for orders. Later, that officer would be one of the heroes of the difficult battle. No one in the IDF had taught these soldiers the real meaning of 'purple rain' or what to do in such a situation. From this point onward, the investigation notes, the spotters maintained remarkable composure, providing detailed, life-saving reports over the radio and did not stop, even when they realized that dozens of terrorists who had just blown the fence were racing toward their base in trucks and on motorcycles. Minute by minute: Fighting at Nahal Oz base 6:31 a.m.: A lookout spots the first Hamas cell before it breaches the fence and immediately reports it to the Golani force outside the base. The commander of the Nahal Oz sector, Golani 13th Battalion Deputy Commander Major N., informs all forces via radio: 'This is a complex event. Purple rain and Turkish cavalry' (code names for infiltrating terrorists). 6:33 a.m.: Another lookout reports the first explosion at the newly constructed 'formidable' border fence, which easily collapses, allowing a Nukhba unit to quickly enter the area in trucks and motorcycles, each carrying two terrorists. The platoon commander, Har-Aven, orders everyone to prepare: 'This is definitely a complex event.' 6:35 a.m.: Major Har-Aven joins a nearby company combat team in his armored patrol jeep. He quickly boards a heavily armored Namer APC attached to a tank. He forgets his mobile phone in the jeep. 6:36 a.m.: Two Golani soldiers run under mortar fire to reinforce their comrade, who is guarding the base's gate alone. The trio—Staff Sgt. Dor Lazimi, Staff Sgt. Ori Karmi, and Staff Sgt. Adir Bogale—will fight heroically at their position against dozens of Hamas terrorists until they fall in battle. 6:37 a.m.: Two active-duty soldiers from the northern battalion stationed at the base leave in a jeep as part of a military protocol, despite their comrade, tracker Warrant Officer Ibrahim Kharuba, urging them to stay and defend the camp. Investigators viewed their actions negatively, but like other soldiers in rare instances who did not seek contact, they were hard to judge. The two remained in the sector, found themselves in another battle zone, and fought until they were injured. 6:38 a.m.: A third lookout in the Nahal Oz command post identifies and reports a new breach in the fence and a large-scale infiltration of terrorists about a kilometer from the base. She and her colleagues try to contact the Pega outpost to request mortar fire on the breach area, but communication problems and ongoing fighting at Pega prevent this. 6:42 a.m.: Cpt. Shir Eilat, the lookout platoon commander, constructs a full situational picture for all forces, detailing enemy positions and IDF units. Based on this, the brigade reserves are activated towards Nahal Oz. 6:43 a.m.: Major N., stationed at the observation post, observes a new breach where dozens of Hamas terrorists are heading toward Route 25, which leads to the Sa'ad junction and then to the entire Gaza envelope. He rushes to the base junction to block the infiltration, becoming the first Nahal Oz commander to encounter terrorists. At this point, the commander of a nearby Golani company orders his soldiers to spread out in the base’s fortified perimeter positions. 6:46 a.m.: As commanders fighting in the base area shout over the radio, 'Where are the tanks?!' two tank crews, who had not been put on relevant standby, mount their tanks, crush 3-4 terrorists, and fire a shell, killing another five in the base’s southwest corner, where about 40 terrorists are concentrated. The tank crews do not see the remaining terrorists and continue toward a position near the border, following their training protocol to reach the fence as quickly as possible, 'because the enemy is in Gaza.' 6:49 a.m.: Major Har-Aven realizes he is in command of the sector alone and divides his limited forces—one tank and one Namer APC—into two fighting hubs. A mortar section commander from a nearby force requests permission to fire. The debrief describes this as another example of the significant cognitive gap among the soldiers, as they were trained this way, despite the fact that the event had been ongoing for 20 minutes. 6:50 a.m.: A tank arriving from the outpost towards Major Har-Aven receives orders from him to head to the Kfar Aza. However, the arriving force struggles to understand what’s happening in the settlement, takes a position outside, and becomes ineffective. Meanwhile, Major N., continuing to fight desperately at the base entrance, is hit by a bullet to his head and severely injured. His soldiers try to stabilize him under fire, but the already-weak human defense line collapses after about ten minutes, and the terrorists breach the base. 6:51 a.m.: The number of soldiers at the base when the attack began, 18, steadily decreases due to numerous casualties. The terrorists exploit gaps in the outpost fence and holes in the western wall, intended for lifting concrete panels, to fire crossfire from outside into the soldiers. 7:00 a.m.: Major Har-Aven receives orders from the brigade commander to command the battalion. The remaining armed personnel in the base focus on protecting the fortified rooms, where dozens of unarmed and frightened soldiers are sheltering. Major Har-Aven receives another report about the dire situation in Kfar Aza and sends his reconnaissance force with two jeeps, but they do not enter the settlement, likely due to fear, and head north instead. Later, they will testify: 'We saw an RPG missile flying near us, so we didn’t enter Kfar Aza and continued to the outposts, then to Sderot.' The debrief viewed their conduct negatively, but they did not flee or hide, instead reaching the Sderot checkpoint and engaging in heavy fighting with the terrorists there. 7:08 a.m.: More than 40 terrorists breach the weakened defense line at the base and begin firing at its buildings. Cpt. Shir Eilat, the lookout officer, hears them approaching the command post door and physically raises her orders according to the 'position abandonment procedure.' 4-5 staff officers from the Golani 13th Battalion stay with the lookouts and do not exit to fight. 7:30 a.m.: Major B., commander of Company B, is occupied with blocking a Nukhba unit attempting to infiltrate the Nahal Oz kibbutz. Major Har-Aven returns to the base with his Namer APC and sprays terrorists in his path with a MAG machine gun. At this point, an anti-tank missile is fired at him, severing his hand almost completely. 7:41 a.m.: The first airstrike, by a UAV, disrupts the movement of terrorists in a field adjacent to the base. 7:55 a.m.: Major Har-Aven retreats slightly due to his injury and meets his friend, Major B., the second-in-command, at the gatehouse to receive help with the kibbutz sector. The two plan an assault on the captured base with two tanks and a Namer APC. Major B. tells his injured friend, still on his feet: 'Let’s go, it’s just you and me against the world.' 7:56 a.m.: In these minutes, moments of heroic valor are seen in the fortified rooms. Captain Eden Nimri, commander of a Sky Rider team, manages firefights with terrorists surrounding the shelter alongside four of her soldiers. Female soldiers throw back two grenades thrown at them; the third explodes and injures them. The chaos is used by 11 other female soldiers to escape to another shelter. The terrorists follow them, but a UAV strikes nearby as they are at the door, forcing the terrorists to flee, and the 11 soldiers survive. 8:00 a.m.: Major Har-Aven begins fighting inside the outpost with the tank but realizes it is ineffective compared to the Namer APC. He decides to exit because the terrorists flee whenever they see the armored vehicles, while they continue slaughtering the rear-echelon soldiers in the camp. It is difficult for his three Namer soldiers to exit into the hellish scene, but he urges them: 'This is why we enlisted, this is what we swore to.' They go out with him into the battle for their lives, as their commander bleeds and has his hand severed. Few against many, they charge and kill terrorists, but deadly fire from four directions hits them. Major Har-Aven and two soldiers are killed. The radio operator, Soldier S., takes a bullet to his weapon but continues to fight. 8:54 a.m.: Nahal Oz base is finally overrun. The two tanks inside attempt to evacuate casualties, including Major Har-Aven and his soldiers. Eventually, they make the difficult decision to exit towards the border to block the continuing invasion. At this point, around 200 terrorists flood the base. The small armored team, along with a platoon sergeant from Golani, takes position in a field between the base and the border, facing 60 terrorists of the third wave rushing toward them. The soldiers charge forward, absorbing anti-tank missiles and heavy fire, killing terrorists until they, too, are overrun. 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.: The toughest hours at Nahal Oz base. Terrorists move from shelter to shelter, from room to room, including killing soldiers from the Balloon Observation Unit. Air support struggles to assess the situation due to the chaos, smoke, and fires, but succeeds in some disruption strikes around 11:00 a.m. Combat helicopter pilots identify a Humvee stolen by terrorists from the base but suspect it may contain kidnapped soldiers, so they refrain from attacking it. Tracker Ibrahim Kharuba from the village of Marar, raised in the Paratroopers Brigade, guards with two other soldiers the room where the lookouts are hiding. The northern brigade commander instructs him: 'Act according to your judgment, you’re the commander there now.' The terrorists call on him in Arabic to surrender. He calls his family to say goodbye, telling the female soldiers, 'It has been an honor to die for the country and for you.' He goes to charge and is shot dead. 12:00 p.m.: The command post and adjacent room where 22 soldiers, including lookouts and five staff officers from Golani, are sheltering, are set on fire. Most die from the flames or suffocate from the smoke, but some manage to escape by crawling out through a small window. Investigators struggled to assign blame to those present in the situation, who were simply trying to survive, but concluded, 'In the IDF, an officer should leave after a soldier, and a female soldier after a female soldier.' Senior fire investigators who examined the scene found no evidence of harmful chemicals or accelerants used. 1:30 p.m.: The first reinforcements from Shayetet 13 and the YAMAM counterterrorism unit begin arriving and find only one or two terrorist cells that hadn’t managed to retreat back to Gaza. Nahal Oz base is mostly in ruins, with bodies, fire, and smoke. Conclusions, lessons and recommendations Lt. Col. Tomer Greenberg, commander of Golani Brigade's 13th Battalion, who later fell in combat in Gaza, had conducted numerous drills for his forces from Nahal Oz, including one just before the massacre, emphasizing the need to be prepared for a surprise attack. However, no exercises simulated an attack on the base itself, which was not organic and included forces from different units that did not know each other—this proved detrimental on the morning of October 7: The collection battalion’s forces, including the lookouts and the Balloon Unit, were too dispersed across bases in Orim, Re’im and Nahal Oz, contributing to the loss of control and operational confusion in real time. Although the command post was closest to enemy territory, it wasn’t designated as a defensive target and was only prepared against rocket and mortar threats, with only a fire extinguisher assigned in case of fire. The division didn’t rehearse scenarios with the brigade, which didn’t train the Nahal Oz battalion, and so on for an attack scenario on the base. The lack of coverage for the base’s western positions was a critical and dangerous failure. Base staff officers were sleeping with their weapons not at hand, despite being only 15 minutes from the Gaza Strip. The debrief concluded: Operational norms were lacking. A minimum number of forces must be assigned to the outpost at all times. Multi-unit bases should be discontinued. Command climate was deficient. The battle at the base represents a profound and painful systemic failure that touches upon the core values of the IDF. While there were moments of heroic valor and exceptional resourcefulness from soldiers and officers, there were also soldiers and commanders who did not seek contact. The investigation did not examine the lookout warnings prior to the war and how the commanders responded to them, but they clearly warned about the threat. This needs to be investigated separately. Also, the way the IDF handled the bereaved families from the base after October 7 should be reviewed. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1userxojx	2025-03-03T07:58:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/29/Hy04jSPu1e/Hy04jSPu1e_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

700 soldiers, senior commanders and chaos: Inside the October 7 m...	IDF probe into October 7 Hamas attack on Kfar Aza reveals critical intelligence failures, delayed military response and acts of heroism as outnumbered defenders fought to protect their community Seven hundred combat troops, battalion and brigade commanders and two division commanders were present, yet none were able to contain the horrific attack. Cries for help went unanswered as the first forces arrived in the Young Generation neighborhood, much after several residents had already been abducted. Instead of evacuating residents, they were instructed to remain in their safe rooms—where the terrorists ultimately reached them. Others were evacuated to the kibbutz gate and told to hitch rides from there. The military investigation into the events of the October 7 massacre at Kfar Aza reveals both failures and acts of heroism. The IDF's official inquiry focused on one of the more problematic decisions made by senior command in the past decade: a significant reduction in troop deployments along the Gaza border on weekends and holidays. While Israelis were unaware of this policy, Hamas was not. The terror group exploited it to the fullest—not only in the massacre at Kfar Aza, where 64 residents were murdered and 19 were abducted, including Gili and Ziv Berman, who remain in captivity—but also in the wounding of many others and the near-total destruction of the kibbutz. Eighteen IDF soldiers were killed defending Kfar Aza. Half of the force assigned to protect it was on leave for the holiday. The probe found that it took approximately two hours before a small, insufficient force arrived to ward off the attack, despite the kibbutz being just three kilometers (under two miles) from the Nahal Oz military base. By then, 200 terrorists of Hamas' elite Nukhba force had already overrun the community. For those two hours of unrelenting violence, the kibbutz was defended solely by its 18-member alert squad. Seven were killed, and others fought on despite being wounded and lost valuable time in retrieving weapons from an armory that had been locked under IDF orders. The decision to allow so many troops to take leave—made out of concern for their well-being—has since been reversed, albeit belatedly. There were many acts of heroism that day. One example highlighted in the IDF inquiry was that of 22-year-old Neta Epstein, who threw himself onto a grenade hurled into his safe room, sacrificing his life to save his partner. Military intelligence failed to detect Hamas’ preparations for the massacre, which began on Friday evening. By dawn Saturday, dozens of terrorists were already in vehicles, waiting for the order to attack. At 6:29 a.m., Hamas launched 960 rockets and missiles at IDF positions along the border to pin down any reinforcements. That was the signal for terrorists to storm the border fence, which was breached near Kfar Aza at three points: 6:35, 6:41 and 6:43 a.m. At the same time, six Nukhba terrorists on gliders landed in the kibbutz—a moment captured on film by Ynet photographer Roy Edan, who was murdered in the attack. His young daughter, Abigail, witnessed her father's killing before being taken from his arms and abducted to Gaza. According to the IDF probe, a Hamas terrorist told Abigail to run to the neighbors, who were later taken hostage as well. Initially, 80 terrorists infiltrated Kfar Aza, later joined by 170 more in two subsequent waves. Unlike in other communities and military posts, they looted relatively little. According to intelligence, most of the terrorists in Kfar Aza had planned to continue their assault on Kibbutz Sa’ad—where their attack was thwarted—and on the city of Sderot. Instead, they remained in Kfar Aza. The terrorists took up fortified positions inside the kibbutz. Around noon, an IDF officer arrived and found a hand radio near a terrorist’s body. He overheard orders instructing the terrorists to 'stay in the kibbutz and prepare for a long battle.' The intelligence failures leading up to the massacre continued throughout the attack. No one in the elite SIGINIT Unit 8200 thought to monitor the communications of terrorists who had already infiltrated Israel. The attackers were prepared for an extended battle, bringing advanced first aid kits to treat their wounded, along with military equipment and ammunition to last for days. The destruction in Kfar Aza was among the most extensive that day. Six of the kibbutz’s eight neighborhoods were devastated. In the Young Generation neighborhood, 11 of the 37 residents were murdered, and seven were abducted. At the peak of the assault, 250 terrorists were inside Kfar Aza, using it as a staging ground for swift movement. In addition to motorcycles, pickup trucks and private vehicles they had driven from Gaza, they also used cars and even bicycles belonging to kibbutz members. Only two families, realizing the danger early, managed to escape by car. The IDF carried out seven airstrikes to support Kfar Aza, but only one occurred on the day of the attack; the rest took place the following day. Another 19 airstrikes were launched on Saturday elsewhere, seemingly slowing down additional terrorists heading toward the kibbutz. Despite the presence of three battalion commanders, three brigadiers and two division commanders—including one kibbutz resident who fought the terrorists with only a knife—along with 1,200 reinforcements from 24 units, no senior officer was able to take control of the chaos. As a result, most Kfar Aza residents remained trapped in their safe rooms with the wounded and dead for two more days as the fighting continued into a third day. The last resident was murdered on Saturday at 6 p.m., and the final soldier was killed on Tuesday afternoon. A total of 101 terrorist bodies were found inside the kibbutz, but most of the attackers managed to escape back to Gaza. The last terrorist inside Kfar Aza was killed on Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. The IDF inquiry concluded that misplaced confidence in the Gaza border barrier led to an inadequate defense strategy, creating dangerous gaps in situational awareness and operational readiness. For an entire day, troops operated without command and control. They arrived without proper combat gear, and even by evening, many were still acting independently, without clear orders from the Southern Command or IDF General Staff. The lack of coordination enabled further kidnappings. Until late Saturday night, no force managed to secure the three-to-four-kilometer stretch between Kfar Aza and the border. Senior officers did not fully grasp the plight of the besieged residents for half a day. It was only after two officers managed to reach the command post at the kibbutz entrance, which was set up Saturday evening, that a clearer picture emerged. Residents, particularly those evacuated late, reported seeing IDF forces remaining outside the kibbutz. However, according to the investigation, only a few troops hesitated to enter, primarily in the morning hours. Most of the forces seen outside were medical teams and administrative personnel. The investigation praised the United Hatzalah emergency response organization for dispatching ambulances into the combat zone and saving many lives. The IDF said that Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel’s primary ambulance service, did not cooperate with the inquiry. The findings revealed that, in some instances, IDF forces did not treat residents appropriately. Some wounded civilians, evacuated only to the entrance of the kibbutz, were left to hitch rides to hospitals—even on Saturday night. The bodies of murdered residents were removed late, only on Tuesday, and survivors of the massacre were exposed to horrific scenes during an evacuation that was largely unsecured. Numerous desperate pleas for assistance from residents to the IDF went unanswered. 'We did not properly instruct soldiers on how to evacuate civilians, so the blame does not lie with them. In the Young Generation neighborhood, trapped residents cried out for help even during the night,' the IDF acknowledged. 'There is a need for an external review of the events at Kibbutz Kfar Aza. At this stage, no personal conclusions have been drawn—some lessons have yet to be learned, while others have already been implemented.' Minute by minute: The massacre at Kfar Aza 6:42 – 6:45 a.m.: Following a barrage of dozens of rockets and mortars targeting the kibbutz, which began at 6:30 a.m., six Hamas terrorists land inside Kfar Aza as an advance force, arriving on three motorized paragliders. From the air, they fire at residents, some of whom are still outside their homes, trying to grasp what is happening. This is likely when Ynet photographer Roy Edan was murdered, after managing to capture the first moments of the infiltration. His young daughter, Abigail, was later abducted, while his wife, Shin Bet employee Smadar Mor Edan, was killed in the family's reinforced safe room shortly after. 6:50 – 6:54 a.m.: The first pickup truck carrying terrorists enters the kibbutz through the rear solar-powered gate, which was breached with an explosive charge. Almost simultaneously, Hamas operatives break through three sections of the border fence. Another terrorist vehicle enters via a second rear gate, intended for pedestrian use. The attackers spot 72-year-old kibbutz resident David 'Kachko' Katzir on his morning run and kill him—making him the first victim of the massacre. 6:55 a.m.: The terrorists know exactly where the kibbutz armory is located—possibly due to intelligence provided by Gazan laborers who had worked in the community, according to the investigation. Members of the local alert squad rush to retrieve their locked weapons, but the attackers head there as well, aiming to neutralize the defense force. Heavy fighting erupts. Among those battling the terrorists is Brig. Gen. (res.) Israel Shomer, a resident of the kibbutz and former commander of the 146th Division. At 6:40 a.m., he had managed to call IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Southern Command head Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, reporting the situation. 7:25 a.m.: A regional force, including a single tank, reaches the outskirts of Kfar Aza. It was dispatched by company commander Shilo Har-Even, who later fell in battle at the Nahal Oz military base and has since been recommended for the Medal of Valor. However, from the tank’s position, its crew is unable to fully assess the chaos unfolding inside the kibbutz. The tank’s communication systems were damaged at the onset of the attack, and its crew struggles to operate their mounted machine guns due to the sustained fire. Unable to reach Golani Brigade officers engaged in fierce combat elsewhere, the tank commander contacts his direct superior from the 77th Armored Battalion. The officer advises him to leave Kfar Aza and redeploy southward to other battle zones. 'I didn’t understand the full picture of what was happening inside, so I left,' the tank crew later explained. Meanwhile, the rest of the regional Golani forces are engaged in heavy defensive battles between the Nahal Oz military base and Kibbutz Nahal Oz, as well as on the border bridge, trying to repel the mass Hamas infiltration. 7:28 a.m.: Dorrit Wertheim, 54, who was responsible for distributing emergency messages to kibbutz residents, is murdered. A fellow resident takes over the critical task of providing guidance to the community, but communication on WhatsApp remains unsynchronized with the IDF. 7:30 a.m.: Another 150 Hamas Nukhba terrorists infiltrate the kibbutz, entering through a third breach near the Young Generation neighborhood, adjacent to the perimeter road. By this point, there are already 10 Hamas pickup trucks and multiple motorcycles inside the kibbutz, each carrying two terrorists. The attackers go house to house, killing residents in cold blood. When they find many safe rooms locked, they decide to set them on fire. 8:30 a.m.: For the first time since the attack began, an initial IDF force arrives—a small, outnumbered contingent from the regional battalion, unable to shift control from Hamas. The force is led by Capt. (res.) B., commander of Company B from the 13th Battalion, who arrives under orders from Battalion Commander Lt. Col. Tomer Greenberg, who was returning from weekend leave. (Greenberg was later killed in Gaza during the war.) B. takes an armored personnel carrier (Namer) from the battalion’s reserve near Kibbutz Alumim and advances into Kfar Aza, where 150 terrorists are still present and 37 residents have already been murdered. Two Golani reconnaissance jeeps are sent toward the kibbutz, but their troops decide to continue north rather than enter. 'We looked in the rearview mirror and saw an RPG rocket pass right by us, so we decided to head toward Kibbutz Mefalsim,' they later told investigators. The same soldiers eventually reached Sderot, where they played a key role in the heroic battle at the city's captured police station. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 8:33 a.m.: Capt. B.’s armored personnel carrier runs over several terrorists and relies primarily on WhatsApp messages from residents to determine where to go and where wounded civilians need rescue. At 8:42 a.m., the first attack helicopter is deployed at B.’s request, conducting a strike to isolate the kibbutz from external threats. 9:44 a.m.: A joint force of 15 police officers and soldiers arrives at the kibbutz after navigating Hamas ambushes that have effectively cut off the area by targeting roads and intersections. The force is immediately engaged upon entry, sustaining casualties but managing to eliminate several terrorists. 10:34 a.m.: A military force from the Duvdevan unit, consisting of 16 soldiers in two armored vehicles from the Samaria region, enters the kibbutz and is immediately drawn into heavy fighting, including anti-tank fire targeting their vehicles. The unit is aided by a fellow Duvdevan soldier who lives in the kibbutz and helps guide them. During the battle, the force loses six soldiers. At one point, they spot a man emerging from a house with a shotgun, mistake him for a terrorist, and fatally shoot him. Meanwhile, a small team from Sayeret Matkal arrives at the kibbutz, splitting into two groups. Four of them attempt to flank the enemy but are ambushed and killed at close range by terrorists hiding inside a house. 10:46 a.m.: The commander of the elite Maglan unit arrives at the kibbutz with a small force, along with undercover officers from the Israel Police’s Southern District. Simultaneously, a force from the Paratroopers' 890th Battalion enters the kibbutz. The various units attempt to organize combat teams, divide sectors and launch counterattacks against the large number of terrorists still inside. 11:00 a.m.: Brig. Gen. Dan Goldfuss, commander of the 98th Division, arrives at the kibbutz by chance and fights alongside Maglan soldiers for about an hour. He then leaves to assume command of the wider battle zone and orders the commander of the Commando Brigade to take charge of all operations inside the kibbutz. 11:24 a.m.: Chief Superintendent Shimon Portal, an intelligence officer from the Israel Police’s Southern District, arrives at the kibbutz to rescue his daughter and other young people trapped in the Young Generation neighborhood. His presence proves critical, and the intelligence he relays back helps military commanders realize that the IDF must concentrate its efforts on this area, where many terrorists are barricaded inside fortified prefab homes, along with stunned civilians. 11:48 a.m.: A second Duvdevan force enters Kfar Aza with 53 regular soldiers. During the two-hour period from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., despite the arrival of initial reinforcements, 18 residents are murdered, 19 are abducted to Gaza and seven soldiers are killed. Only 18 civilians are successfully evacuated from the kibbutz during this time. 12:50 p.m.: A military force arrives at the Young Generation neighborhood, hours late—after the abductions have already taken place, but with many terrorists still barricaded inside small apartments and safe rooms alongside terrified residents. Despite repeated pleas for help, no rescue had come until now. Confusion reigns across the kibbutz, where hundreds of soldiers are now present, but no single commander is coordinating them. 'We went house to house, saw residents, confirmed they were okay and just told them to stay in their safe rooms instead of evacuating them,' soldiers later told investigators. 'After we left and continued searching, terrorists reached some of them.' 1:30 p.m.: Brig. Gen. Shomer joins forces with the Paratroopers’ 202nd Battalion. As they advance toward the Young Generation neighborhood, they encounter heavy resistance, with soldiers killed in the fighting. Meanwhile, the commander of the Jerusalem District Counterterrorism Unit is alerted by one of his officers inside the kibbutz, who directs him toward the embattled neighborhood and warns of a large ambush at its entrance. 1:52 p.m.: Lt. Col. Tomer Greenberg, commander of the 13th Battalion, leads a force of around 50 soldiers from Duvdevan and Sayeret Matkal into the Young Generation neighborhood. However, breaching the fortified buildings proves difficult. A Namer armored personnel carrier attempts to ram through buildings with limited intelligence on whether terrorists, civilians or both are inside. 2:00 – 4:00 p.m.: By this point, more than 700 soldiers are in the kibbutz, including Givati Brigade Commander Col. Liron Batito, who joins the fighting. Yet no one considers deploying forces to isolate the area. Many terrorists remain hidden in the surrounding fields, launching attacks on soldiers into the night, including along the kibbutz’s perimeter fence. 4:00 p.m.: A unit from the elite Shaldag reconnaissance force is dispatched to locate 10-month-old twins from the Berdichevsky family, whose parents, Itay and Hadar, were murdered that morning. The infants are found crying by IDF soldiers and finally evacuated to safety at 8:00 p.m. by Lt. Col. Greenberg. 5:00 p.m.: For the first time, Givati Brigade Commander Col. Liron Batito assigns combat sectors within the kibbutz, working alongside the Paratroopers' 202nd Battalion. Meanwhile, the Commando Brigade commander assumes leadership of the battle in Kfar Aza. 6:00 p.m.: Eliyahu Orgad, 72, is killed—likely by IDF fire—when troops target a vehicle carrying Hamas terrorists attempting to flee toward Gaza. Unbeknownst to the soldiers, Orgad was restrained inside the car and hidden from view. Meanwhile, hundreds of kibbutz residents remain trapped in safe rooms, still awaiting evacuation. 6:41 p.m.: An additional 300 reservists from the 55th Brigade arrive and begin searching the kibbutz’s empty industrial area. 7:00 p.m.: The Commando Brigade’s command center is established at the Alonit gas station near the kibbutz entrance. 9:00 p.m.: A kibbutz resident, having spent the entire day hiding in his safe room, cautiously emerges and spots a military vehicle. As he slowly approaches, he opens the rear door to ask for help, but the soldiers, fearing he is a terrorist, open fire, wounding him moderately. Another soldier, realizing the mistake, kicks the wounded man away from the line of fire to save him but is also shot in the leg in the process. 11:00 p.m.: The evacuation of most Kfar Aza residents finally begins, following the intervention of two residents, Yoni Peled and Nira Shpak, who arrive at the command center and push for urgent action. Due to widespread fear, civilians only agree to open their safe rooms after receiving a prearranged password. Many are horrified to see the bodies of dozens of their neighbors as they exit the kibbutz. 11:30 p.m.: A young Maglan officer realizes that control will not be established overnight without better coordination. He creates a WhatsApp group named 'Kfar Aza Command & Control' and adds dozens of commanders from different units—IDF, Shin Bet and police—who were operating in the kibbutz but had no direct communication with each other. While the group improves coordination, it also spreads unverified rumors, such as false reports of a tunnel near the kibbutz from which 25 terrorists allegedly emerged. Midnight – dawn: Although many residents are evacuated, some remain stranded outside the kibbutz at the Alonit complex, while others reach Route 232, forced to hitchhike out as the sounds of ongoing gunfire echo from the Young Generation neighborhood. In a bizarre moment, an officer also resorts to hitchhiking—but in reverse: he stops bulldozers and a reservist tank unit from the 10th Brigade on Route 232 and redirects them to help breach the fortified safe rooms where terrorists remain barricaded. The chaos continues, with a deadly clash between Shayetet 13 forces and terrorists near the kibbutz swimming pool at 5:37 a.m. Sunday, 8:00 a.m.: The IDF has managed to evacuate 60% of the kibbutz residents, but hundreds remain trapped. Dozens of Hamas terrorists are still inside Kfar Aza, and the battle continues throughout the day, though the combat zones are increasingly contained. Monday morning: Shayetet 13 is tasked with rescuing the last remaining civilians still hiding in safe rooms—now in their third day without food or water, some wounded and others trapped alongside the bodies of their loved ones. Tuesday morning – Tuesday evening: The final phase of the evacuation takes place, followed by sweeps to locate and eliminate the last remaining terrorists, most of whom are wounded. By the afternoon, an order is given for all active combat units to withdraw, leaving 55th Brigade reservists in charge of securing the kibbutz. At 6:00 p.m., troops from the 28th Battalion of the brigade spot and kill the last wounded terrorist, who is still clutching a knife. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyfca4qoyg	2025-03-03T07:08:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/27/r1rgcadKzT/r1rgcadKzT_0_196_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

I am sure you feel at home now': Slain hostage Itzik Elgarat lai...	Hundreds gather in Kibbutz Nir Oz to bid farewell to slain hostage after 509 days in Hamas captivity; family and mourners honor his memory in emotional funeral, vowing to continue fight to bring home remaining hostages Hundreds of mourners gathered Monday afternoon to lay to rest Itzik Elgarat, who was abducted from his home on October 7 and whose remains were returned to Israel after 509 days in captivity. He was buried in Kibbutz Nir Oz, the community from which he was taken. Earlier in the day, thousands assembled outside the Great Synagogue in Rishon Lezion, waving Israeli flags and paying their respects before joining the funeral procession that departed the city in the morning and reached the kibbutz in southern Israel by midday. Elgart’s sister, Rachel Dancyg, eulogized him with a moving tribute. 'Itzik, my dear brother, now you are up there with Eli, Uri, Mom and Dad, watching over us, sending love. I am here below, a survivor from Kibbutz Nir Oz. I love you all. The Elgart family is well known—an unusual family, a family of artists, talented, leading and beloved. You, Itzik, were the kibbutz’s handyman. You could fix anything, improvise with extraordinary skill.' Reflecting on their lives in the community, she recalled, 'Eli, Itzik and I arrived at Kibbutz Nir Oz in the 1970s, after our military service. We gave so much of ourselves, and we received so much—until it all ended. The land became a field of blood and slaughter. The army didn’t come. They took you, and they took Alex Dancyg, the father of my children, into dark tunnels, into hell. You never returned. We failed to save you and our friends. So many of our loved ones vanished that day—murdered, abducted, children taken, complete devastation. None of us remain.' Elgarat’s brother, Danny, who fought tirelessly for his release, also delivered an emotional eulogy. 'My brother, you have come home. I promised I would bring you back, and I kept that promise. I am sure you feel at home now—you have returned to Nir Oz. Itzik, sadly, you were right. Your last words before you were taken, bleeding, were ‘Danny, this is the end.’ You already knew, but we refused to believe. We fought with all our strength to prove you wrong. We failed. We didn’t do enough.' Before the funeral procession left Rishon Lezion, mourners approached Danny to offer their condolences. 'I’m so sorry that we received Itzik in a coffin—that he did not come back alive,' one woman told him. Danny, a civics teacher at a local high school, expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support. 'I am overwhelmed by what I see here,' he said, thanking Rishon Lezion’s mayor, whom he called 'a true leader.' He added, 'We will continue until the last hostage comes home.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In a particularly emotional moment, Danny embraced his brother’s casket, wrapped in a black shroud, and wept. The crowd sang Israel’s national anthem, Hatikva, as Danny addressed Itzik one final time: 'You are returning home now, to the land of Nir Oz. I promised to bring you back—alive or dead—and now you are home.' As the funeral procession continued toward Nir Oz, where Elgart was laid to rest, the struggle to bring home the remaining hostages carried on. Rishon Lezion Mayor Raz Kinstlich also paid tribute to Elgart. 'This is not how we wanted to welcome you home, Itzik. Our hearts are aching. Thousands have come to salute you and bid you farewell. Itzik endured 509 days in Hamas captivity—in hell on earth. A father of two daughters, a brother to Danny and his sisters, Itzik was taken from the safe room in Nir Oz. His brother Danny fought to bring him home.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjgztbmojg	2025-03-03T06:24:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/03/BkZkjf7oyx/BkZkjf7oyx_0_215_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Haifa terror attack: Assailant gets off bus and stabs repeatedly ...	A terrorist from Shfar'am carried out a stabbing attack in Haifa, killing a resident of Kafr Kanna on a bus near the entrance to the city's central station. After exiting the bus, he stabbed another person, with chilling recordings from the scene capturing the panic: 'This is a terror attack! I see three casualties, there is a child on the ground'; The attacker’s family claims he suffered from mental health issues, while investigators are focusing on his activities abroad and why he returned to Israel. Recordings from emergency responders reveal the panic during Monday morning’s deadly stabbing attack at Haifa’s Central Station. 'Someone on the bus pulled out a knife. This is a terror attack! There’s a small child on the ground. I see three casualties,' a woman is heard saying as she called for medical help. Footage shows the assailant stepping off the bus and continuing his attack, repeatedly stabbing a 65-year-old man from Kafr Kanna in the back until he collapsed. The attacker, a 20-year-old Druze resident of Shfar'am, was shot dead by security personnel. See footage of the attack: According to Magen David Adom, the first report of the attack came at 9:53 a.m. A total of five people were wounded, including the man who was killed. Three others were seriously injured, including a 15-year-old boy whose condition later stabilized and is now listed as moderate. A woman in her 70s was also wounded and is in moderate condition. Israel Police confirmed that the attacker, named as Yitro Shahin, a 20-year-old with German citizenship from the northern city of Shfar'am, began his stabbing spree on a bus before exiting at Haifa’s Central Station, where he continued attacking people until he was shot dead by security personnel and a civilian. Investigators are now examining his recent stay abroad and his reasons for returning to Israel last week. His family claims he suffered from severe mental illness. 'We are shocked by what happened. He had been struggling with mental illness for years,' his uncle, Roni Haris, told Ynet. 'I am an IDF veteran with a disability, and his other uncle is a reservist. There is nothing in our family that is hostile to the state. This is a tragic incident, and we want to understand what really happened because all we have been told is that he was killed. We want the truth and answers to our questions.' Eyewitness accounts suggest that the assailant traveled on a bus from northern Israel before boarding another bus and continuing to Haifa. 'He got off at the central station, shouted 'Allahu Akbar,' and started stabbing people on the platform,' a witness said. Security guards then shot and neutralized him. The deputy mayor of Shfar'am, Faraj Hanifas, echoed the family’s claim that Shahin suffered from severe mental illness and was receiving treatment from the city's welfare department. However, he expressed strong condemnation of the attack. Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, the spiritual leader of the Druze community in Israel, also denounced the attack. 'We strongly condemn this morning’s incident. My condolences go to the family of the victim, and I wish a full recovery to the wounded. This is a tragic and painful event, and my heart is with the families. Before drawing conclusions, it is important to wait for a thorough investigation by security forces regarding the background, circumstances, and the severe mental illness from which he suffered,' he said. He also emphasized that members of the Druze community actively fight terrorism, noting that Druze security personnel were involved in neutralizing the attacker. In the aftermath of the attack, authorities investigated whether the 65-year-old victim, in addition to being stabbed, may have been mistakenly shot by a security guard who had identified him as the assailant. Following examinations, officials confirmed that the man had suffered multiple stab wounds to his neck and that a single bullet wound was found on his foot — likely from the shots fired at the terrorist. However, police stated that the gunshot was not the cause of death, and his body was sent for an autopsy. Magen David Adom paramedic Itai Mazor described the chaotic scene: 'There was absolute mayhem, with security guards and police officers rushing in from all directions. Despite the tragic outcome, the attack could have been far worse. Fortunately, there weren’t too many civilians at the scene, or it could have ended much more tragically.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israel’s police chief, Danny Levi, visited the site of the attack, which is one of Israel’s largest transportation hubs, and confirmed that 'one terrorist was eliminated by civilian forces.' He added that security forces were conducting searches and setting up roadblocks to ensure that the assailant acted alone. Acting National Security Minister Haim Katz held a security briefing to assess the situation and receive updates on the victims. 'The coming days will be challenging,' he said. 'The Israel Police and all emergency and rescue agencies are on high alert, but the public must remain vigilant and report any suspicious individuals without hesitation. I commend the security guards who acted swiftly and neutralized the terrorist.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkiquqxokl	2025-03-03T04:34:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/03/Byl4vB11Xjkl/Byl4vB11Xjkl_425_461_2576_1450_0_small.jpg
Phishing attack targets Foreign Ministry staff around the world	Diplomats receive messages claiming to be from senior officials or well-known personalities in an effort to breach Foreign Ministry computers and retrieve sensitive information Employees of the Foreign Ministry around the world have become targets of a sophisticated phishing attack in recent days. The attackers, who portrayed themselves as senior officials such as cabinet secretary Yossi Fuchs or well-known personalities such as Avi Berkowitz, a close associate of U.S. President Donald Trump, attempted to dupe the staffers using fake messages that appeared as if they were formal communication, asking them to click on links or accept Zoom calls which would enable the attackers to access ministry computers and retrieve information. One such message addressed to an employee of the ministry was claimed to be from Berkowitz. Dear Eyal, the message read, I am a Special Representative of Mr. Kushner. Given the need for extensive diplomatic cooperation between the US government and the MFA we intend to have more extensive cooperation in this area. You are one of the most important people in this area and I intend to discuss further details regarding the expansion of diplomatic cooperation. Given the importance of this matter, I have been assigned to contact you personally. Another message claiming to be from Fuchs was sent to a staffer in the ministry. 'I decided to cooperate more in this matter,' the message said. 'I hope we can discuss more details in the future.' A senior ministry official said the matter is under investigation and the ministry is working in cooperation with security and cyber authorities to identify the attackers and prevent further harm. Similar attacks have been made against official and strategic targets in Israel in recent months. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Data security officials said these attacks were especially sophisticated and meant to retrieve sensitive information and erode the confidence in Israel's diplomacy. Among clear indications that these are false messages are the misspelling of names, requests to connect to unknown links and invitations to Zoom calls from suspicious sources. The Foreign Ministry published guidance to its employees, stressing that such communications must be blocked and the relevant authorities notified.

Close Netanyahu ally says peace deal with Palestinians possible i...	Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer tells Jeiwsh Agency Board of Governors that once Palestinians realize Israel cannot be destroyed, they would join Arab states in making peace and that Hamas must be destroyed but first hostages must be freed; Says PM told him Qatari funding for Gaza brings quiet to south Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said a peace deal could be signed with the Palestinians if Hamas was defeated. Dermer spoke in a closed meeting with the Jewish Agency's Board of Governors. According to the minister, after the eradication of Hamas, the Palestinians would understand that the notion that Israel could be destroyed is impossible and after seeing it achieve peace with Arab states, would make peace as well. Dermer, who rarely makes public appearances, said he is certain that Hamas could be defeated, but the hostages must first be extracted from Gaza and that there are considerable efforts underway to get more of the hostages out. Regarding the day after the war, the minister said Israel is waiting to see how the outline proposed by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, which Israel supports, would develop. Dermer said that during the war, then-U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told him that Hamas was an idea that could not be destroyed, to which he replied that the Nazi ideology was also an idea and there is no Nazi state. Hamas, he said, may remain an idea but must not rule over territory. The Trump administration is better for Israel and the president has given his full unequivocal support, Dermer said, adding that President Joe Biden had done a lot for Israel and his actions are appreciated, but Hamas had identified the small differences between the previous administration's position and that of Israel and hoped to cause a rift between the two. Under Trump, he said, there is not even a slight gap. Dermer told the Board of Governors that when he was Israel's ambassador to the U.S. he refused to publish a post approving of Qatari money being delivered to Gaza. Dermer did not say who had asked for him to publish the post but said he ultimately published a watered-down version after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told him it would calm the situation in the south. He then shared that, during Netayahu's visit to the White House last month, Trump was given a gold pager as a gift, alluding to the successful operation against Hezbollah when thousands of pagers exploded in the hands of senior operatives of the terror group. Vice President J.D. Vance then asked for one as well and a special one in silver was made for him. Now, Dermer said, there is an ongoing competition among officials in the White House to see who will receive a pager in bronze	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk111szqsyl	2025-03-03T03:01:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/22/SJByJHCDJe/SJByJHCDJe_0_134_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Bedouin tracker, who defended IDF female lookouts at Nahal Oz on ...	Warrant Officer Ibrahim Kharuba fought until his last bullet defending the female lookouts at Nahal Oz base on October 7; His extraordinary bravery has led to a recommendation for Israel's second-highest honor; 'He was a man of values' his father said The investigation into the battle at the Nahal Oz base on the morning of October 7, 2023, exposed severe operational failures but also highlighted the extraordinary bravery of the soldiers stationed there, including Warrant Officer Ibrahim Kharuba, who is one of two soldiers recommended in the investigation to receive the Medal of Valor, the second-highest decoration in the IDF. 'He acted admirably — this is how I raised him. He was a man of values,' his father, Hassan, said. Kharuba served as a tracker in the northern brigade of the Gaza Division. On October 7, 2023, he joined the deputy commander of the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion, who had taken control of the area. Realizing the magnitude of the attack, Kharuba took command of the fighting at the entrance to the lookout post's command center. Together with two officers from the 13th Battalion — Lieutenant Nimrod Eliraz and Lieutenant Yohai Duchan — and a soldier, Staff Sergeant Itai Ron, Kharuba fought to block the terrorists at the command center door. He fought until his last bullet and was later found at the position closest to the door. According to reports, before he fell, Kharuba told the terrorists that he would never surrender. He spoke to the terrorists in Arabic, trying to convince them to leave the female lookouts alone in the name of Islam The investigation revealed the trackers and female lookouts performed their duties effectively, identifying and warning of the threats early on. However, these warnings were blatantly and systematically ignored. During the battle, Kharuba reportedly stood and told the female lookouts that it was an honor for him to die protecting them and the State of Israel. 'It was my greatest honor to defend you,' he said, according to details uncovered in the investigation. His father, Hassan, shared in an interview with Ynet that he was not surprised by the details revealed in the investigation. 'Ibrahim called us that morning. He said the situation was dire and that dozens of terrorists had reached the base. He told us he was protecting the female lookouts. In our culture, the least one can do is protect women and daughters. I know exactly the kind of man I raised — Ibrahim was a man of values who would use his own body to shield others,' he said, his pride mixed with grief. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hassan added that his son was a traditional, observant man who prayed regularly. Ibrahim came from a Bedouin family, many of whom volunteered to serve in the IDF. Hassan noted that his son spoke to the terrorists in Arabic, trying to convince them to leave the female lookouts alone in the name of Islam. 'Those who carried out the October 7 attack are a disgrace to Islam. Their behavior is despicable and unacceptable; it shames every true Muslim,' he said. Regarding the recommendation to award his son the Medal of Valor, Hassan said: 'Ibrahim was extraordinary. That morning, he asked us to take care of his wife and children. He already understood it was the end. He is deserving of the medal; he is a war hero.' The Medal of Valor was last awarded in 2007 to six soldiers who fought in the Second Lebanon War. Since the founding of the state, it has been awarded a total of 220 times. Only two soldiers have received the medal twice: Oved Ladizhinsky, who was killed by shielding a fellow soldier from a grenade explosion and saving his life, and former IDF Chief of Staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyhif0gjje	2025-03-03T01:21:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/BJfkLIgAcke/BJfkLIgAcke_0_0_1177_1102_0_small.jpg
Eli Sharabi's fight for freedom	Comment: 'Eli Sharabi is no ordinary man. In fact, he truly is one of a kind' After 491 days—that's 16 months—in Hamas captivity, released hostage Eli Sharabi is finally free. But his ordeal is far from over. In his first courageous interview since his release, he recounts the horrors he endured—the relentless beatings, the psychological terror, but above all, the starvation. Sharabi, a 52-year-old man, returned from captivity weighing just 44 kilograms. His body is weak, but his spirit remains unbroken. U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly watched Sharabi’s emotional and gut-wrenching testimony on Israeli television and has invited him to the White House. Despite his fragile condition, his brother Sharon—who has fought relentlessly for his release since his abduction on October 7—says this is a critical moment for the hostages still in Gaza. And so, the two will attempt the journey to Washington. After watching the full-length interview, one thing is certain: Eli Sharabi is no ordinary man. In fact, he truly is one of a kind. He survived brutal captivity in Gaza. His wife and two daughters were murdered by Hamas. His brother Eli died in captivity. His home was destroyed. And yet, somehow, he still finds the strength—to be grateful, to speak, and to fight. Not for himself, but for those still left behind.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1wfb11qsje	2025-03-03T01:16:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/SJbld8oKJl/SJbld8oKJl_0_164_1575_887_0_small.jpg
Ramadan in Gaza: A holiday overshadowed by war	Palestinian resident of Gaza: 'This year, we have no homes, no money—we have exhausted all means of life' In Gaza’s Khan Younis, residents are struggling to uphold Ramadan traditions amid the devastation of war. Markets still offer food and drinks, but the usual festive atmosphere is absent. 'Before the war, we would sit together at one table, sharing meals with neighbors, young and old. But this year, we have no homes, no money—we have exhausted all means of life,' said Palestinian resident Abu Salah Madi. Israel and Hamas are currently in a fragile ceasefire, which has resulted in the release of 33 Israeli hostages and 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli negotiators have arrived in Cairo in hopes of extending the truce, prioritizing further hostage releases. West Bank Tensions Amid Ramadan In the West Bank, Ramadan preparations are subdued. Markets that would typically be bustling ahead of the holiday are seeing fewer shoppers, as vendors cite increased security restrictions. 'In past years, the markets were packed with people, eating and drinking with ease. But now, the situation is completely different,' noted vendor Amir Amireh. Jerusalem on High Alert At Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, preparations are underway for an influx of worshippers. The Waqf has installed protective coverings in the courtyards, but tensions remain high. The site has been a frequent flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, raising concerns over potential clashes. With Ramadan beginning this weekend, both Palestinians and Israelis brace for a volatile period. Will the ceasefire hold, or is another escalation imminent? The coming days will determine the answer.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjhwybmj1x	2025-03-03T01:11:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/02/S1xgdcNGokg/S1xgdcNGokg_0_284_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Russia foils Islamist attack against 'Jewish religious institutio...	A terrorist planning suicide bombings at a Jewish religious institution and a Moscow metro station was killed in a gunfight with Russian Federal Security Service agents; Authorities revealed he intended to join a terrorist organization in Afghanistan after carrying out the attacks The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) announced on Monday morning that it eliminated a terrorist who had planned to carry out suicide bombings at a 'Jewish religious institution' in the Moscow area as well as at a metro station in the capital. According to the Russian news agency RIA, the terrorist was killed after a gunfight, during which he opened fire at FSB agents who came to arrest him. According to Russian authorities, the terrorist was a Russian citizen but was born in one of the Central Asian countries. He allegedly had planned to use improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to target a Jewish religious institution in the Moscow area and one of the city's metro stations. He had conducted reconnaissance missions and acquired the necessary components for the attacks. His plan was to carry out the bombings and then travel to Afghanistan to join an international terrorist organization. During a search of the terrorist's apartment, weapons and materials used for making IEDs were found. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In a video released by the FSB Monday morning, the body of the Islamist terrorist is shown along with his handgun and components for an improvised bomb. Additionally, the footage displayed messages found on the terrorist’s phone, which included instructions on how to assemble an explosive device. The RIA news agency reported that Russian security agencies have heightened their vigilance around Jewish institutions in recent months due to tensions in the Middle East and concerns over potential antisemitic attacks. Russia has been under constant threat of attacks by ISIS and other jihadist organizations. Last spring, the country experienced its deadliest attack in two decades when ISIS terrorists targeted a concert hall in the suburbs of Moscow, killing 145 people and injuring more than 180. It was the deadliest ISIS attack on European soil. Efforts to target Jewish institutions in Russia remain a constant threat, and last year Russia announced the prevention of several such attacks. For example, on March 7, 2024, Russia claimed it had thwarted an ISIS attack on a synagogue in Moscow. Three months later, in June, terrorists carried out a combined attack in Dagestan, targeting synagogues and churches. They slit the throat of a priest and killed 19 other police officers and civilians. Six terrorists were killed in a 'gunfight that lasted through the night,' while others were arrested. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkhnllqi1l	2025-03-03T00:59:13-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/03/ryflGbkmjJe/ryflGbkmjJe_0_48_337_190_0_small.jpg
Kremlin says London summit on Ukraine was not aimed at achieving ...	The Kremlin said on Monday that pledges made by European leaders at a London summit on Ukraine over the weekend to increase funding to Kyiv will not help bring about a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other Western leaders on Sunday, where they agreed to draw up a Ukraine peace plan to present to the United States two days after Zelensky clashed with President Donald Trump at the White House. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the results of the summit - including a $2 billion air-defence missiles deal from Britain - will allow hostilities to continue, adding it was critical that Zelensky be forced to change his position and seek peace.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sywqvgxj1e	2025-03-03T00:34:38-08:00	
Ahead of Trump meeting, Netanyahu apologizes to freed hostage Eli...	Ahead of freed hostages' White House meeting with US President Donald Trump, prime minister spoke with Sharabi, whose wife, daughters and brother were killed, apologizing for the delay in contacting him and emphasizing efforts to secure his release. Sharabi, who is traveling to Washington with other freed hostages to meet U.S. officials, urged urgent action to bring home the remaining hostages, both the living and the dead Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Eli Sharabi, a survivor of Hamas captivity whose wife and two daughters were murdered on Oct. 7 and whose brother was killed while being held hostage. The conversation took place a day before Sharabi’s scheduled meeting at the White House with U.S. President Donald Trump. 'I’m sorry it took us so long,' Netanyahu told Sharabi, emphasizing the government’s efforts to secure his release. Sharabi responded: 'The other hostages must urgently be brought home.' Netanyahu told Sharabi he had tried to contact him 10 days earlier, but only now had they been able to coordinate a call. 'I welcome your return home,' Netanyahu said. 'I know that you are enduring difficult days. My wife and I would like to console you on your terrible loss – of Lianne, Noiya and Yahel, and your brother Yossi. I understand the magnitude of the loss; this is awful. I want you to know that I regret that it took us such a long time. We fought hard to get you out; your brother and the entire family fought hard. Sharon was in close contact with me the entire time..' Netanyahu added: 'I tried to speak with you about 10 days ago and I am pleased that it is happening now. I greatly appreciate the bravery with which you have told about what you endured, and it is very important that you also tell this to President Trump. I wish you a successful trip, and when you return, I would be pleased for us to meet, when it is possible. We embrace you will all our hearts.' Sharabi told Netanyahu: 'I am very happy to be home and be reunited with my family. The other hostages, certainly the living, urgently need to return home to their families. And of course, the deceased hostages, including my brother Yossi, must be brought back for burial in Israel so their families can cry over their graves. I thank you for your efforts in this direction. Sharon and I will make our efforts with President Trump, and maybe with our joint efforts we will bring this saga to a close.' Netanyahu responded: 'That is the goal. I want you to know we are not letting up, not for a moment, even as we speak.' Alongside Sharabi, several other freed hostages — including Omer Shem Tov, Iair Horn, Keith and Aviva Siegel, Doron Steinbacher, and Naama Levy — are traveling to Washington for meetings with U.S. officials, including President Trump. The visit is organized by the Hostage Families Forum and Hostage Aid Worldwide. 'The freed hostages will personally thank the Trump administration for the president’s unwavering commitment to securing the release of all hostages and will testify firsthand about the horrors of Hamas’ tunnels,' the families’ forum said in a statement. 'U.S. officials will hear directly about the urgency of bringing all hostages home immediately and in one coordinated effort.' 'Eli is overwhelmed by the response' Osnat Sharabi-Matalon, the sister of Eli and the late Yossi Sharabi, said in an interview with Ynet that Eli was surprised by the outpouring of support following his interview on the Israeli television program 'Uvda.' 'Our family, on the other hand, is not surprised. We’ve been living with this for a year and a half and understand the magnitude of the situation,' she said. Osnat noted that Eli sees the meeting with Trump as an opportunity to express his gratitude for securing his release and to stress the importance of timing. Asked whether he was surprised that the invitation came from the U.S. president rather than Netanyahu, she replied: 'I don’t think he sees it that way. He’s not surprised it was Trump and not Bibi. He’s more surprised by the warmth and support he’s received. He says, ‘I just told my story.’ He did it for Alon Ohel, who’s still there. He feels very close to him, like a father.'

'He always says thank you and gives a hug — that’s who Eli is,' she said. Additionally, he will share his story in the hope of highlighting the urgency of bringing the remaining hostages home. 'I believe that’s enough for him to understand the need to rescue those still alive,' she said. Osnat emphasized her deep concern for the other hostages still in captivity. 'He will definitely bring up his brother, who’s still there, and our fear that if we wait too long, we won’t find him — or the bodies of the 34 other killed hostages.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1wr0jxoye	2025-03-03T00:32:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/03/HytAe17iye/HytAe17iye_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

After surgeries, Emily Damari says scars, missing fingers symboli...	Former hostage held captive by Hamas for 471 days endured horrific conditions and severe injuries; After complex surgeries, she advocates for the immediate release of other hostages, including her friends, and expresses gratitude to world leaders for their support About a month and a half after being released from Hamas captivity, Emily Damari has completed a series of complex surgeries on her hand and leg to treat injuries sustained on October 7. Damari, who survived 471 days under horrific conditions, lost two fingers after being shot twice by Hamas terrorists and was treated in captivity with nothing more than a single expired bottle of iodine. On the morning of October 7, 28-year-old Emily was in her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza when a large number of terrorists attacked the community, murdering 62 residents and abducting 19 others. She was shot at close range in her left hand and right leg, leading to the loss of two fingers and injuries to her leg that impaired her ability to move. Before undergoing surgery at Sheba Medical Center, Emily shared her feelings with her characteristic optimism: 'I have embraced my hand, my pain and my scars entirely. To me, they symbolize freedom, hope and strength.' A photograph of Emily's bandaged hand has become an emblem of inspiration for many people worldwide. After the surgery, she said: 'The surgery on my hand and leg went much better than expected, thanks to the expertise and professionalism of the surgeons at Sheba Medical Center. I want to thank the surgeons, nurses, and staff at the hospital for the amazing care I received.' She added: 'My recovery will take time, and my hand will never fully heal, but the intense pain that accompanied me for a year and a half, due to nerve stitching during my first surgery at al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, is no longer there. The large scar, caused by an open, infected wound that didn’t heal for four months due to the conditions in the tunnels where I was held, now looks much better. After recovery, with the help of physiotherapy, I hope to use my hand much better than I could before the surgery.' Mandy Damari, Emily’s mother, revealed that her daughter was 'stitched up like a pincushion' by Hamas, leaving her in severe pain in her hand and leg. Despite the severity of her injuries and the high risk of infection, Hamas provided no medical treatment other than an expired bottle of iodine. 'It’s nothing short of a miracle that she didn’t develop a life-threatening infection,' her mother said. While Emily was held in Gaza, Mandy spent months appealing to world leaders and human rights organizations to secure humanitarian and medical assistance for the hostages. In a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer last month, Mandy and Emily emphasized that, in reality, Emily received no assistance and was held in 'cruel and horrifying' conditions. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Despite her suffering, Emily is now focusing her attention on the struggle to bring the remaining hostages home: 'Although my injuries weren’t simple, I know there are others still in captivity in worse physical and mental conditions. All hostages must come home immediately, without any further delays.' Two of the remaining hostages are Emily’s close friends from Kibbutz Kfar Aza — twin siblings Gali and Ziv Berman. During the attack, Gali rushed to Emily because she was alone, and the two were abducted together. Emily urged world leaders to keep pressuring Hamas. 'I want to thank President Trump again for securing the deal that brought me home. Please, help us bring Gali, Ziv, and all the other hostages home before it’s too late for everyone,' she said. After her release, Emily and her mother Mandy thanked the British Prime Minister for his personal support during her captivity. They revealed that Hamas held Emily in a school belonging to UNRWA (the United Nations Relief and Works Agency) in Gaza, among other locations. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy has already contacted UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini regarding Emily’s claims about her time in Gaza. Starmer also invited Emily and Mandy to visit 10 Downing Street on their next trip to the UK. The two are looking forward to seeing family, friends and supporters in the UK who fought for her return — including fans of Tottenham Hotspur, the football club she supports. 'After I recover from the surgeries, and after the remaining hostages are freed, I’ll be so excited to return to the UK. There are so many people I want to thank personally for helping me get my life back,' Emily said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1ptw4zo1g	2025-03-02T22:28:48-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/02/SJERH0RZsyx/SJERH0RZsyx_0_984_1688_951_0_small.jpg
Israel believes Hamas will refuse to release more than a few host...	Senior Israeli officials say if fighting resumes it would be intense and include targeted killing of senior members of the terror group who are stealing aid but security cabinet has yet to approve a return to war Senior Israeli officials estimate that Hamas will not agree to release more than a few live hostages and the bodies of other hostages until Israel commits to ending the war. The officials who spoke to the New York Times said the stalemate in negotiations would compel Israel to decide between renewing the fighting and saving the hostages who are still alive. The officials said that the Security Cabinet has not yet approved a new offensive and that only U.S. President Donald Trump could convince Netanyahu not to renew the war. They said that if the offensive is renewed, it would be widespread and intense and would include the targeted killing of senior members of Hamas who are stealing humanitarian aid and the destruction of Hamas government sites. The mediator in the cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas asked the Israeli government to wait a few days before renewing the offensive in the hopes that they would be able to reach an agreement with Hamas that would prevent further war. Israeli officials said on Sunday that they believe chances are slim, although Hamas may agree to some hostage releases. 'We are waiting to see what happens in the coming days. We will not let this drag on,' security officials said. After blocking humanitarian aid delivery to Gaza, Israel is considering further steps, including a stop to the supply of water to the Strip. However, only 19% of Gaza's water comes from Israel. 'They will manage without it and have done so in the past,' the officials said. Israel also can attack infrastructure targets from the air to damage the supply of electricity, including generators. Netanyahu thanked Trump on Sunday 'for his unwavering support for Israel.' In a video clip, referring in English to the Witkoff outline that Israel had accepted but Hamas rejected, which Israel says was proposed by Trump's special Mideast envoy. 'In Witkoff's plan, half of the hostages would be released right away and other half would be released if we reach an agreement on a permanent cease-fire. Israel has accepted this plan, I have accepted this plan, but so far Hamas has rejected it.' He said Hamas' demands were 'totally unacceptable.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We know that America and President Trump have our back,' he said. 'Hamas steals the supplies and prevents the people of Gaza from getting it. It uses these supplies to finance its terror machine, which is aimed directly at Israel and our civilians.' Netanyahu also warned that other steps would be taken if Hamas continued to hold the hostages. The Israeli officials estimated that a return to fighting was not expected in the coming week, partially because the government wants to allow the new IDF Chief of Staff to assume his position on Wednesday. Israel is also waiting for the visit of U.S. envoy Brett McGurk, who is due to arrive on Thursday and whom the officials hope may be able to advance the talks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rju0mcmijx	2025-03-02T22:19:24-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/ByE8ISsOke/ByE8ISsOke_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
Houthis eye renewed attacks as damage caused by Israeli airstrike...	Amid stalled hostage negotiations, senior Houthi officials threaten missile and drone strikes against Israel if Gaza war resumes; Recent satellite images on Google Maps, however, reveal destruction at Yemen's Hodeidah port following Israeli airstrikes Senior Houthi figures have once again stated that they are preparing to resume missile and drone launches toward Israel due to the Israel-Hamas stalemate over the continuation of a hostage deal and the potential reignition of armed conflict between the sides. But they might want to check out Google Maps first, considering the current state of their port following Israeli airstrikes. Recent updates to Google Maps provide a remarkably clear view of the heavy damage to the port of Hodeidah, including its fuel facilities and petrochemical infrastructure. Satellite images vividly capture the extensive destruction inflicted on Yemen, particularly at the Hodeidah port. Israel has targeted the Houthis in Yemen five times during the ongoing conflict. The most recent strike occurred on January 10. The initial attack took place on July 20, 2023, followed by additional strikes on September 29, December 19 and December 26. The port of Hodeidah was repeatedly hit in these airstrikes. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On Sunday, senior Houthi official Nasser al-Din Amer issued a warning on his X account: 'Our eyes are on Gaza, our hands are on the trigger, and our missiles, drones and all military units are on high alert. The directive from our leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, is clear.' Another Houthi official, Hazem al-Assad, added that American interests could also become targets. 'If the war in Gaza resumes, we are ready for a full-scale war against U.S. interests in the region, should the United States attempt to defend Israel, support its aggression against the Palestinian people in Gaza, or attack our nation.' On Friday, during his near-weekly speech, Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi also issued threats, specifically referencing Israel’s decision not to withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor. 'The enemy’s refusal to withdraw from Rafah represents a serious breach of the agreement,' he said. 'If the war in Gaza resumes, the entire Zionist entity, starting with Tel Aviv, will be under fire. We will intervene and provide support through various military means.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hywryazj1e	2025-03-02T22:11:12-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/02/ryETtSfjyx/ryETtSfjyx_0_23_964_543_0_small.jpg

Pope Francis off mechanical ventilation entirely	Pope Francis remained in stable condition and didn't need any mechanical ventilation Sunday, the Vatican said. It was a sign that he had overcome the possible complications from a respiratory crisis Friday and that his breathing function overall was improving as he recovers from pneumonia. The 88-year-old pope did continue to receive high flow supplemental oxygen after Friday's coughing episode, which sparked fears of a new lung infection. Doctors in their late Sunday update said Francis remained stable but again referred to the complexity of his overall condition and kept his prognosis at guarded, meaning he wasn't out of danger. Francis, who has been in the hospital since Feb. 14, rested, prayed in his private chapel and participated in Mass after a morning visit from the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and his chief of staff, Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra. The content of their talks wasn't known, but even when at the Vatican, Francis meets at least weekly with them.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjzqdngijl	2025-03-02T20:00:59-08:00

Freed hostages head to White House to meet with Trump	Eli Sharabi, who lost his wife and daughters on Oct. 7; Omer Shem Tov, released from captivity last Saturday; Iair Horn, whose farewell with his captive brother filmed by Hamas; and Aviva and Keith Siegel, whose video shared by US president, will travel to Washington Five Israelis recently freed from captivity in Gaza are set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday. The group includes Iair Horn, whose brother remains a hostage, and Keith Siegel, an American citizen held for 484 days. Sharon Sharabi, brother of Eli Sharabi who was released after 491 days in captivity, said Sunday that Trump invited them after watching Eli’s emotional testimony in a TV interview. 'Tomorrow morning, we're flying to the White House, and the meeting will take place on Tuesday,' Sharon told Ynet. 'This is the call of the hour,' he said, stressing the importance of the meeting amid stalled negotiations for the release of remaining hostages. The freed hostages will travel to Washington on Monday aboard the private plane of billionaire philanthropist Miriam Adelson. Joining Sharabi, Siegel and Horn are Omer Shem Tov, and Siegel’s wife, Aviva, who was also held in Gaza and released in a hostage deal in November 2023. Several others will accompany them. Shem Tov was released last Saturday, while Horn was freed a week earlier. On Saturday, Hamas released a video showing Horn saying goodbye to his brother, Eitan, who remains in captivity. Their mother, Ruth Strom, said Sunday that Horn had hidden the video from the family to protect them. 'Iair didn’t tell us they filmed them... but I knew something like this would happen,' she told Ynet. The video shows the brothers embracing after 498 days in captivity. Eitan Horn has now been held for 513 days. 'There’s no time to waste,' Strom said, explaining why the family agreed to release the footage. 'Everyone needs to see it, to know, and to feel what all of our hostages are going through. Even those who are no longer alive deserve a proper burial.' After his release, Shem Tov returned home to Herzliya, where thousands of Israelis welcomed him. Supporters held signs reading, 'Welcome back, hero' and 'Omer is back.' Leaving Rabin Medical Center, Shem Tov wore the jersey of Brazil national soccer team legend Ronaldo—the same shirt he had on when he was abducted. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: His brother, Amit, described the moment he embraced him: 'We’re over the moon. There’s no greater happiness than this. Omer is home. It’s like he’s been born again.' For Siegel, this is not his first interaction with Trump. Last week, he sent a video message to the president, which Trump later shared on his social media platform, Truth Social.

Ukraine's Zelensky says he can salvage relationship with US	Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday he believed he could salvage his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump after their explosive meeting in the Oval Office, but that talks needed to continue behind closed doors. In an extraordinary meeting that was broadcast live on Friday, Trump accused Zelensky of being ungrateful for U.S. aid, of showing disrespect to his country and of risking World War Three, casting into doubt Washington's ongoing support for Ukraine. Zelensky, talking to reporters after a summit with European leaders in London on Sunday, said he did not think the U.S. would stop its assistance to Ukraine, because as 'leaders of the civilized world' they would not want to help Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, Zelensky said he remained prepared for any challenges that may arise.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skr00i8gjje	2025-03-02T13:27:46-08:00	
The technician accused of offering Israel's nuclear secrets to Ir...	Doron Bokobza, 29, a technician from Be'er Sheva, is accused of offering sensitive information on the Dimona nuclear reactor to Iranian intelligence; the indictment claims he sent photos, videos and data, falsely claiming access to classified sites for payment He completed the National Technician Training Program, worked as a technician at a chemical factory — and offered to sell Iran information about the Dimona nuclear reactor. Doron Bokobza, 29, a resident of Be'er Sheva and a technician by trade, is accused of initiating contact with the Islamic Republic and offering to sell its agents information, including claims that he had 'access to the Nuclear Research Center' in Dimona. The indictment filed against him accuses him of contact with a foreign agent and transferring information to the enemy. In an article published last year about students at the Technological College for Technicians in Be'er Sheva who completed the same National Technician Training Program, Bokobza was one of the interviewees. He then said: 'From the moment I graduated from the college in July 2023, I was signed to a contract as an employee in the Instrumentation and Control department of Haifa Negev Technologies. I am currently a candidate for the only position in the country as the instrumentation manager of the new ammonia facility.' On his Facebook page, Bokobza shared, among other things, a post by former national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, titled 'I Accuse,' and shared: 'I joined the struggle to save the Negev. As part of the struggle, the Barel Patrol is being established with the approval of the Israeli police, a patrol of volunteer fighters that will operate in the Negev to restore security to the residents. To establish the unit, we are conducting a crowdfunding campaign to purchase auxiliary equipment. I have taken upon myself a fundraising goal, and I would be happy if you could join. Any amount is welcome.' MK Almog Cohen of Ben-Gvir's hard right Otzma Yehudit party, who served as chairman of the Committee to Save the Negev, which Bokobza joined, claimed in response he's never heard of him. Since October 7, Bokobza has published several posts calling for the release of Noa Argamani—a former hostage abducted from the Nova music festival during the October 7 terrorist attack and later rescued in a daring operation—and her partner Avinatan Or, who is still held captive. In one of the posts, he wrote about his acquaintance with them: 'Noa Argamani, where were we eight years ago? Smiling and laughing. Where were we five years ago, on some remote mountain in Bolivia. I rented a motorcycle, and you trusted me enough to climb a steep hill and photograph you looking at the Amazon River. Ah, Noa, how hard it was for me to see your abduction with Avinatan, my friend! A man I looked up to as a savior for me. Noa and Avinatan! I’m waiting for you! Return soon, safe and sound!' Bokobza was arrested last month as part of a joint operation by Israel Police's serious crimes unit and the Shin Bet security agency after being suspected of contacting Iranian agents and carrying out missions under their direction in exchange for financial compensation. The investigation revealed that Bokobza maintained contact with Iranian intelligence agents for several months and carried out security-related missions under their guidance, including photographing sensitive sites and transferring information. Speaking to his Iranian handler, Bokobza claimed to have access to the Nuclear Research Center in Dimona and provided open-source information related to the facility. According to the indictment, Bokobza 'initiated the contact, fully aware that he was in communication with an Iranian handler and that his actions could harm national security.' Bokobza, a former bailiff, contacted Iranian operatives via Telegram, reaching out to profiles displaying Iran’s national flag. From December until his arrest in February, he maintained contact with an Iranian agent, carrying out various tasks under the agent’s direction. As part of the operation, he opened a digital wallet, which received approximately $850 in cryptocurrency deposits. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In December, Bokobza messaged an Iranian agent in Hebrew, writing, 'I am Israeli, and I want to work with you.' The agent later responded in English, asking about his motives. Bokobza cited financial struggles and dissatisfaction with the government. The agent then instructed him to prove his loyalty by filming himself on the street while making a specific hand gesture. Later that day, Bokobza filmed himself driving through Be'er Sheva, making a 'V' sign with his fingers. After sending the video, the Iranian agent transferred $65 to his digital wallet. Days later, the agent instructed him to film and photograph supermarket products—dairy items, fruits, vegetables and their prices—in exchange for $130. Bokobza then sent the agent an unexpected message: 'You will not defeat us. The people of Israel live!' Shortly after, Bokobza received another message from the same Iranian-linked profile, urging him to cooperate. 'Work with us, we want to give you a lot of money. You will have a happy life without worries,' the message read. He initially deleted the message and blocked the profile but later resumed contact. In further exchanges, Bokobza falsely claimed to be an electronics engineer working at a classified facility. He sent the Iranian agent a Wikipedia screenshot detailing the Nuclear Research Center in Dimona. The agent responded with repeated messages, offering substantial financial rewards for his cooperation. Bokobza later proposed meeting the agent abroad. Bokobza sent the Iranian agent a photo of a communication cabinet, claiming it was a key component 'responsible for the heavy water.' The agent then requested an explanatory video. In exchange, Bokobza received $650 in cryptocurrency. After learning about the arrests of two IDF reservists, accused of endangering national security over similar ties to Iranian handlers, Bokobza deleted his communications with the agent and blocked the profile. He later reversed the block and messaged the agent, writing, 'Hey, sorry I blocked you, it’s just that two soldiers who worked with you were caught, so I preferred to delete everything.' In 2021, Bokobza voiced strong criticism over what he saw as the lenient treatment of convicted terrorists in Israeli prisons. 'I served in the army, I was a combat soldier—three of the best years of my life! I pay taxes, they take from my hard-earned salary! And someone who murdered, who never paid taxes, who didn’t serve in the army (at least not the IDF), gets three kilograms of meat a week of their choice, a PlayStation and a premium TV package that rivals the best of Yes [a local satellite television provider]. I’m ashamed,' he wrote. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1npkgzi1e	2025-03-02T13:02:29-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/02/H13AflMsJg/H13AflMsJg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Amid cease-fire end and Hamas’ refusal to extend talks, incoming IDF chief Eyal Zamir summons top commanders to Southern Command; White House backs Israel’s halt to Gaza aid, saying it negotiated 'in good faith' and will support its next steps Incoming IDF chief of staff Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir summoned on Sunday senior military officials to Southern Command for a meeting on Friday. The gathering, set to take place two days after Zamir takes over as Israel’s top military officer on Wednesday, comes as Israel prepares for a potential resumption of fighting against Hamas following stalled hostage negotiations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered a halt to humanitarian aid to Gaza earlier Sunday after Hamas refused to extend the cease-fire or accept a negotiation framework proposed by U.S. mediator Steve Witkoff. Netanyahu defended the decision to cut off aid, insisting Hamas will not receive 'free meals' and that the cease-fire cannot continue without additional hostage releases. The decision, made in coordination with the United States, has drawn criticism from Hamas and Arab states, including Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said Washington supports Israel’s move. 'Israel has negotiated in good faith since the start of this administration to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas terrorists. Given Hamas’ declaration that it is no longer interested in extending the cease-fire, we will support Israel’s next steps,' he said. According to Al Jazeera, Israel had proposed a cease-fire framework before halting aid in which Hamas would release five living hostages and the remains of ten others in exchange for Palestinian prisoner releases and increased humanitarian assistance. Hamas reportedly rejected the offer, insisting that no further hostage releases would take place without advancing to a second phase of negotiations, which it says must include an end to the war. Egypt sharply criticized Israel’s decision, with Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty accusing it of imposing a policy of starvation. 'Humanitarian aid cannot be used as a weapon for collective punishment and starvation in Gaza,' he said at a press conference alongside European Commissioner for the Middle East Dubravka Šuica.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer rallied his European counterparts Sunday to shore up their borders and throw their full weight behind Ukraine as he announced outlines of a plan to end Russia's war. 'Every nation must contribute to that in the best way that it can, bringing different capabilities and support to the table, but all taking responsibility to act, all stepping up their own share of the burden,' he said. Starmer's exhortation to 18 fellow leaders that they need to do the heavy lifting for their own security comes two days after U.S. backing of Ukraine appeared in jeopardy when President Donald Trump lashed out at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and said he wasn't grateful enough for America's support. The meeting had been overshadowed by the extraordinary scolding. Starmer used the opportunity as part of his broader effort to bridge the gap between Europe and the U.S. and also salvage what had seemed like the start of a peace process before Friday's spat. Starmer said he had worked with France and Ukraine on a plan to end the war and that the group of leaders—mostly from Europe—had agreed on four things. The steps toward peace would: keep aid flowing to Kyiv and maintain economic pressure on Russia to strengthen Ukraine's hand; make sure Ukraine is at the bargaining table and any peace must ensure its sovereignty and security; continue to arm Ukraine to deter future invasion.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkqugrgo1x	2025-03-02T11:41:30-08:00

The event, a significant fixture in Russia’s political calendar, will take place in Red Square on May 9. Amid Israel’s ongoing efforts to maintain ties with Moscow, Israel has been invited to attend, though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not expected to participate. Instead, Israel will be represented by its ambassador to Russia, Simona Halperin. In comments to Russian media, Halperin emphasized Israel’s historical stance, saying, 'Historical facts do not change due to geopolitical or other circumstances.

Russia jails five for 2023 anti-Israel airport riot in Dagestan	Local court sentences Dagestan residents to up to 10 years in prison for their roles in the violent October 2023 riot at Makhachkala Airport, where an anti-Israel mob stormed the terminal searching for passengers arriving from Tel Aviv Five residents of Dagestan were sentenced to prison for their roles in the violent riot targeting Israelis at Makhachkala Airport in October 2023. They received prison terms ranging from eight to 10 years. The defendants—Ramazan Abdulabakov, Ismail Amirov, Yasin Gadzhiev, Magomedali Omarov and Magomedgadzhy Chirgilaev—were found guilty of 'participating in mass riots involving violence and pogroms' and 'failing to comply with transportation safety regulations at transport infrastructure facilities.' The riot took place on October 29, 2023, amid the war in Gaza. Hundreds of rioters stormed the airport looking for passengers arriving on a flight from Tel Aviv. The airport was temporarily shut down and damages exceeded 24 million rubles ($270,000). Thirty security personnel and police officers were assaulted, with 23 injured.

After ignoring alerts ahead of October 7, IDF continues to downpl...	Internal report shows 88% rise in reservist complaints in 2024 over service conditions, commander misconduct, pay issues; also details harassment of female soldiers, verbal and physical abuse and claims of political bias in dismissals The ongoing war has created significant new challenges for the IDF, and in some areas, it has struggled to address them. Among the concerns are the service conditions of reservists—many of whom left their civilian lives to defend the country—as well as those of female surveillance soldiers, whose critical role was underscored by the deadly Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack. A report released Sunday by military ombudswoman Brig. Gen. (res.) Racheli Tevet-Wiesel found that complaints from reservists surged 88% last year. In total, 6,777 complaints were filed with the ombudsman's office in 2024, an 18% increase from 2023. The report, which was submitted to the defense minister and the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, found that 55% of the complaints investigated were justified. Some complaints came from soldiers serving as lookouts, including those assigned to crucial intelligence positions. One soldier serving on the Egyptian border reported that while handling a security incident, her battalion’s deputy commander entered the command center and yelled: 'Which surveillance soldier spoke to me? She’s delusional,' and referred to her as a 'confused girl' and a 'total mess.' The complaint alleged that the officer later told her commander, 'If I were you, I’d give her two slaps.' According to the investigation, the officer had been frustrated with the soldier’s response time during the incident. He later explained that his comments were made in the heat of the moment out of concern for the troops’ safety. Following the incident, the battalion commander reprimanded him, emphasizing the need for respectful communication. The ombudsman wrote that the officer’s behavior was 'severely flawed,' adding, 'A commander must act and speak in a respectful and restrained manner toward subordinates and set a personal example, regardless of dissatisfaction with their performance.' The report noted that the officer apologized and that no further intervention was deemed necessary beyond informing his superiors. Concerns over lookout safety Since the Oct. 7 attack, which saw dozens of soldiers serving as lookouts killed and others abducted by Hamas, many female recruits have requested not to be assigned to these positions. Some conscripts, even before starting their training, refused to serve in the surveillance unit and were detained at an IDF induction center. Complaints from those held in detention described harsh and degrading treatment by officers in the recruitment unit. The ombudsman noted that most of these complaints were not fully investigated because the soldiers withdrew them after being released. However, she raised the issue with the commander of the recruitment unit at the time. Following a review, the unit decided to assign more experienced reserve officers to oversee detentions and ensure appropriate treatment. Additionally, parents of surveillance soldiers expressed concern over their daughters being stationed in border outposts, arguing that their proximity to conflict zones placed them in unnecessary danger. Parents of soldiers serving near the northern border complained that, unlike in other regions, surveillance posts in their area had not been relocated further inland for safety reasons. The division commander met with concerned parents, explaining the necessity of keeping surveillance troops near the frontlines to support field operations. He assured them that additional security and protective measures were being implemented to enhance their safety. Rise in complaints over abuse and harassment The report highlighted a sharp rise in complaints about commanders’ behavior, particularly from conscripts, who described harsh treatment and degrading language. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Some allegations involved physical violence and threats. Complaints included incidents of commanders kicking and choking soldiers, slapping a soldier in the face and making threats such as, 'I’m about to put a bullet in your head.' One soldier reported being humiliated when his head was forcibly shaved in front of others. In some cases, the military police and prosecution were involved, while in others, senior commanders addressed the issues internally. One female soldier complained that a senior noncommissioned officer insulted her, saying, 'You should dye your hair blonde because you’re stupid.' The officer later admitted to making the remark, apologized and explained that it was said in frustration over her performance. The ombudsman reprimanded him and ordered that the incident be documented in his personal file. Another complaint came from the parents of combat soldiers who said their sons' platoon commanders verbally abused them. One commander, who was later dismissed, allegedly called his troops 'traitors' and ordered them out of their tent, telling them, 'Get the hell out, you deserve this.' Another officer reportedly warned his soldiers to stay away from those he labeled 'traitors.' The involved commanders were disciplined, receiving detention as punishment. In a separate case, a team commander was reported for routinely insulting his troops, calling them 'losers,' 'weaklings' and other derogatory names. He was reprimanded by his superiors, and a discussion on appropriate leadership was held with the unit. Mistreatment over political views Among the numerous complaints from reservists, one stood out: A soldier claimed he was dismissed from his unit not for his political activism. The reservist, who had participated in anti-government protests in 2023, alleged that his company commander used a minor infraction as a pretext for his removal, primarily due to his political views. The ombudsman’s inquiry found that the official reason for the dismissal was cited as a serious disciplinary issue. However, she noted that the commander inappropriately referenced the reservist’s political affiliations during their conversation about his removal. While the investigation determined that the commander did take disciplinary action against others for similar infractions, the ombudsman stressed that political disputes should be defused early to prevent them from escalating into harmful exchanges. Reservists report issues with payment and service record The report also addressed a surge in complaints about reservist pay. Many reservists reported discrepancies in their service records that affected their compensation. The ombudsman attributed the issue to administrative overload, unit transfers and a lack of communication between military departments. Specific complaints included unpaid standby duty, incorrect records of reserve days, incomplete compensation for reservists on extended active duty and delays in reimbursement for travel expenses. The ombudsman found that failures in coordination and a lack of familiarity with regulations had contributed to these issues, which affected the financial entitlements of many reservists. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyniiszjjg	2025-03-02T08:47:58-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/B1s84U0t1e/B1s84U0t1e_0_203_2500_1408_0_small.jpg

What’s next in Gaza? Israel weighs renewed Gaza offensive amid Eg...	Israel suspends Gaza aid after Hamas rejected US-backed proposal to extension cease-fire and release hostages in phases; Netanyahu warns Israel would not allow cease-fire without hostage releases, while Egypt condemns aid cutoff and calls for renewed talks Israel’s decision to suspend humanitarian aid to Gaza and adopt a cease-fire framework drawn up by U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Wittkoff, followed failed negotiations with Hamas, according to reports in Arab media on Sunday. Al Jazeera reported that before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the aid cutoff, Israel proposed releasing five live hostages and ten bodies in exchange for Palestinian security prisoners and increased humanitarian aid. Hamas reportedly refused the offer. Behind the scenes, discussions took place between Israel and mediators, with the aid suspension reportedly coordinated with the U.S. According to the report, Israel demanded in the past 48 hours that Hamas release more hostages, both live and deceased, to extend the first phase of the deal and lay the groundwork for the second. Hamas, however, insisted it would not release additional captives without progress toward Phase II—widely understood to include an end to the war. Hamas considers these new demands a violation of the original agreement and remains committed to its initial terms. Addressing the aid suspension, Netanyahu told his Cabinet that Hamas would not receive 'free meals' and that he would not allow the cease-fire to continue without the release of more hostages. Meanwhile, Egypt strongly condemned Israel’s move, with its foreign minister accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon. 'Humanitarian aid cannot be used as a tool for collective punishment and starvation in Gaza,' said Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty. Speaking alongside European Commissioner for the Middle East Dubravka Šuica at a press conference, Abdelatty called on Brussels to apply 'greater pressure' on Israel to uphold the cease-fire agreement’s terms. Netanyahu told his Cabinet that Israel’s decision to adopt Wittkoff’s proposed framework was made in full coordination with Washington. The plan calls for extending the temporary cease-fire by 50 days, through the end of Ramadan and Passover, and releasing all hostages in two phases—half at the start and half at the end—if terms for ending the war are agreed upon. Netanyahu said Wittkoff described his proposal as a 'corridor to negotiations for Phase II,' and stressed, 'Israel is ready for that.' Netanyahu dismissed claims by media analysts that Israel is violating the original cease-fire deal with Hamas, arguing that negotiations for a permanent truce were supposed to begin on the 16th day of Phase I but have not yet taken place. 'Under the original agreement, Israel is allowed to resume fighting after day 42 if it determines negotiations are ineffective,' he said, adding that this clause was backed by a side letter from the previous U.S. administration and supported by the Trump administration. Despite this, he said, 'we accepted Wittkoff’s plan because we are committed to bringing our hostages home.' However, Netanyahu said Hamas has so far rejected the framework. 'If Hamas changes its position, Israel will immediately enter negotiations to implement it,' he said. He warned that Israel would not allow an indefinite cease-fire without hostage releases: 'There are no free meals. If Hamas thinks it can continue the cease-fire or enjoy Phase I conditions without returning hostages, it is gravely mistaken.' Addressing Israel’s decision to halt humanitarian aid to Gaza, Netanyahu accused Hamas of hijacking incoming supplies. 'Hamas is seizing all goods sent to Gaza, abusing the population, shooting at civilians trying to access aid and turning humanitarian relief into a terror budget against us. We will not tolerate this.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Netanyahu also issued a veiled threat, saying, 'If Hamas remains entrenched in its position and refuses to release our hostages, there will be further consequences—which I will not elaborate on here.' Despite Netanyahu’s tough rhetoric, some Cabinet ministers said they did not get the impression Israel was eager to resume fighting, following a security briefing during the meeting. 'I don’t think Hamas is interested in fighting right now, and I don’t think we are either—not in the immediate term,' one minister told Ynet. However, ministers also noted that Hamas appeared unlikely to accept the Wittkoff framework. When asked about next steps after cutting humanitarian aid, officials indicated that electricity and water supplies to Gaza could be targeted next, but no specific decisions were detailed. Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes continued in Gaza on Sunday in response to violations of the cease-fire by Hamas, the IDF said. Palestinian health officials reported four deaths from the strikes, bringing the total number of fatalities during the 42-day cease-fire to 116, according to Hamas-run health authorities. The IDF confirmed one of the strikes targeted suspects planting explosives near Israeli forces in northern Gaza, saying, 'The Air Force eliminated the suspects to neutralize the threat. The IDF will continue to act against any threat to Israeli citizens and its forces.' Palestinians also reported injuries from an airstrike on an apartment in Rafah’s Tel al-Sultan neighborhood. Meanwhile, Egyptian officials, quoted by the Qatari newspaper The New Arab, said Cairo attempted to broker a compromise between Israel and Hamas. The proposal calls for extending the cease-fire by two weeks—far shorter than the 50-day extension proposed by Wittkoff and supported by Israel. In exchange, Israel would receive three living hostages and the bodies of three others. According to Egyptian sources, an Israeli delegation was expected to arrive in Cairo for talks on the proposal, though Israeli officials later denied any such plans. 'The report of an Israeli delegation traveling to Cairo today is incorrect. We have not received an Egyptian proposal,' an Israeli official said. However, a separate report by Al Jazeera was not explicitly denied. Egyptian Foreign Minister Abdelatty reiterated his condemnation of Israel’s suspension of humanitarian aid to Gaza, vowing to push forward negotiations on the next phase of the cease-fire agreement. 'All remaining commitments under the agreement must be implemented, and negotiations for Phase II must begin,' he said, while acknowledging that 'political will is needed to move forward.' Early Sunday, following the formal end of the first phase of the hostage deal, Israel halted all humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza and closed the border crossings. Netanyahu’s government approved the decision overnight amid stalled negotiations and Hamas’ refusal to accept the Wittkoff framework. Humanitarian aid had been a key pressure tool for Israel throughout the war and is particularly critical during Ramadan. However, Israeli officials view the current aid freeze as largely symbolic, noting that Hamas has stockpiled supplies after receiving 25,200 aid trucks during the cease-fire. According to Israeli estimates, the terrorist group has enough provisions to last at least four months. Water is still being supplied to Gaza’s desalination plant, officials confirmed. The Prime Minister’s Office justified the aid suspension by citing Hamas’ rejection of further hostage releases under the proposed U.S.-backed deal. 'With the end of Phase I of the hostage deal and Hamas’ refusal to accept the Wittkoff framework, which Israel agreed to, Prime Minister Netanyahu has decided to halt all aid deliveries to Gaza. Israel will not allow a cease-fire without hostage releases. If Hamas continues to refuse, there will be further consequences,' the statement read. The previously unknown Wittkoff framework, which Israel officially adopted after Netanyahu’s overnight discussions, proposes extending the cease-fire for 50 days—through the end of Ramadan and Passover. Under the plan, half of the remaining hostages in Gaza, both living and deceased, would be released at the beginning of the extension, with the rest freed on the final day if a permanent cease-fire agreement is reached. According to Israeli estimates, Hamas and other Gaza-based terrorist groups currently hold 59 hostages, 35 of whom have been declared dead by Israel. Of the remaining 24, officials believe 22 are still alive. Hamas swiftly rejected the proposal. In a statement to Al Arabiya, the group said: 'Wittkoff’s plan to release half of the hostages is skewed in favor of Israel’s vision. It contradicts the Gaza cease-fire deal brokered by the U.S.' Palestinian Islamic Jihad also dismissed the proposal, accusing Netanyahu of 'choosing a policy of starvation over honoring the cease-fire agreement.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjdcpwfije	2025-03-02T08:20:36-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/02/ByclPibs1l/ByclPibs1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

UK's Starmer calls on Europe to step up to secure Ukraine peace	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged European leaders on Sunday to step up their defense efforts to not only help secure peace in Ukraine but stability across the continent at a summit staged as a show of support for President Volodymyr Zelensky. Just two days after Zelensky clashed with U.S. President Donald Trump and cut his Washington visit short, the Ukrainian leader was welcomed in London by world leaders, who hugged him in turn, and pledged their backing. Starmer said Europe needed to meet a once-in-a-generation challenge. 'Getting a good outcome for Ukraine is not just a matter of right and wrong, it is vital for the security of every nation here and many others, too,' Starmer said at the beginning of the meeting flanked by Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron. 'Today's meeting is to unite to discuss how to deliver a just and enduring peace together and to make sure Ukraine can defend and protect against any future Russian attack.' Trying to revive hope for peace in Ukraine, Starmer said urgent talks with Trump, Zelensky and Macron over the weekend had cemented the idea that a 'coalition of the willing' in Europe would need to move quickly to come up with a peace plan to be presented to the United States.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjg8m11fi1l	2025-03-02T07:07:12-08:00	
Trump aide Waltz says US needs Ukrainian leader who wants peace	A top adviser to President Donald Trump said on Sunday that the United States needs a Ukrainian leader who is willing to secure a lasting peace with Russia but that it is not clear Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is prepared to do so. Days after a contentious Oval Office exchange between Trump, Zelensky and Vice President JD Vance, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said Washington wants to secure a permanent peace between Moscow and Kyiv that involves territorial concessions in exchange for European-led security guarantees. Asked whether Trump wants Zelensky to resign, Waltz told CNN's State of the Union program: 'We need a leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians and end this war.' 'If it becomes apparent that President Zelensky's either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in his country, then I think we have a real issue on our hands,' Waltz added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skmhbwzi1x	2025-03-02T07:04:43-08:00

Iran's parliament ousts economy minister over economic mismanagem...	Lawmakers vote to remove Abdolnaser Hemmati over currency’s sharp decline and soaring prices of basic goods; supporters warn removal amid US sanctions could worsen instability, while opponents say he prioritized lifting sanctions over mitigating their impact Iran's parliament voted on Sunday to remove the country's Economy Minister Abdolnaser Hemmati from office over mismanagement of the economy and a plunging national currency, state media reported. The parliament has ousted Hemmati in a no confidence vote almost eight months after President Masoud Pezeshkian appointed his cabinet. Over the eight-month period, Iran’s currency has lost close to half of its value against the U.S. dollar, according to unofficial websites, such as alanchand.com. The Iranian rial now trades at 927,000 to the U.S. dollar, against 595,500 in August of last year. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Parliamentarians opposing Hemmati argued that he had failed to prevent price increases in basic goods such as medicine, food and housing while being unable to control the foreign exchange market, state media said. Hemmati had prioritised ending U.S. sanctions on Iran and removing the country from the Financial Action Task Force’s blacklist, state media said. This was opposed by MPs who believe Tehran should focus on 'neutralizing' sanctions. Hemmati's supporters said it was not the right time to remove the economy minister as Iran remained under U.S. sanctions and replacing him would cause further instability, according to state media. The economy is the top challenge for Iran's ruling clerics, who fear a revival of protests by lower and middle-income communities angry at growing poverty that have erupted since 2017. U.S. President Donald Trump has reinstated his 'maximum pressure' campaign aiming to cut Iran's oil exports to zero. In the vote, 182 parliament members backed the no confidence motion on Hemmati, while 89 voted against the measure, according to state media. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk00dmlfo1x	2025-03-02T06:12:43-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/02/By4rVlGjJe/By4rVlGjJe_0_34_2747_1547_0_small.jpg
Israel mulls extending service for reserve troups as renewed war ...	As Hamas rejects a cease-fire extension, government to debate prolonging emergency reservist mobilization allowing call up of up to 400,000 troops The government will convene on Sunday to discuss extending the emergency order allowing the IDF to call up reservists against the backdrop of Hamas' refusal to extend the first phase of the hostage and cease-fire deal. The order was first approved on October 10, 2023, and has been renewed multiple times throughout the war. The proposal stated that, like 2024, the year 2025 is expected to be a year of war, with ongoing instability in various combat zones — even in areas currently under cease-fire. 'In light of the continued war and the IDF’s personnel needs, it is proposed to approve the order allowing the continued mobilization of reservists under Tzav 8 (emergency call-up) for an additional three months,' the document read. The proposed order, which would remain in effect until May, would authorize the mobilization of up to 400,000 reservists. According to the draft resolution, the measure would 'allow reservists currently on active duty to continue serving as required for combat and operational needs until their release date is determined. Additionally, it would enable the recruitment of additional reservists to replace and refresh those previously called up.' Alongside the military draft proposal, the government is also set to discuss the approval of coalition funds. On Saturday, Housing and Construction Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf issued a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing the government of violating coalition agreements. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The letter, addressed to Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs under the subject line 'Violation of Coalition Agreements,' referred to a February 23 meeting in Netanyahu’s office where Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich reportedly agreed with leaders of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism and Shas parties to allocate NIS 1 billion ($270 million) for religious institutions, including funding for exempt schools (which are not subject to state curriculum requirements) and an additional NIS 60 million ($16 million) for public institutions via the Welfare Ministry. 'Contrary to what was agreed upon, we were surprised to see that these commitments are not reflected in the budget proposal being submitted to the government,' Goldknopf wrote. Meanwhile, tensions persist over the conscription exemption law for ultra-Orthodox men, which remains unresolved. Leading rabbis are holding discussions to form a unified stance, but no consensus has been reached, prolonging the crisis. The combination of stalled budgets and the ongoing draft exemption dispute has increased friction between ultra-Orthodox parties and the prime minister’s office. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjp5wazoke	2025-03-02T04:40:11-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/06/SyHtMztZJl/SyHtMztZJl_375_330_1049_591_0_small.jpg

Israeli charged with offering Iran ‘access’ to nuclear research s...	Authorities say engineer Doron Buchbaza, 29, initiated contact, shared publicly available details, and carried out tasks for payment in crypto over months An Israeli engineer has been indicted for allegedly initiating contact with Iranian intelligence and offering to sell classified information, including claims of access to Israel’s nuclear research facility. Doron Buchbaza, 29, a Be’er Sheva resident and engineer at Haifa Chemicals South, was charged Sunday with contacting a foreign agent and transferring information to an enemy, according to an indictment filed by state prosecutors at the Be’er Sheva District Court. He was arrested last month in a joint operation by Israeli police and the Shin Bet security agency. Investigators say Buchbaza established contact with Iranian intelligence through Telegram, messaging profiles displaying the Iranian flag. 'I am an Israeli and I want to work with you,' he wrote according to the charges. From December until his arrest in February, he allegedly carried out various tasks for his Iranian handler, including photographing sensitive sites. He also falsely presented himself as having access to the Negev Nuclear Research Center and provided publicly available details about the facility. Authorities allege Buchbaza initiated the contact, fully aware that he was engaging with Iranian intelligence operatives and that his actions could harm national security. At the request of his handler, he filmed himself making a hand gesture on a Be’er Sheva street and later took videos of supermarket prices, earning small payments in cryptocurrency. The indictment states he later escalated his activities, offering to meet his handler abroad and sending a photo of a communications rack, falsely claiming it was linked to a nuclear facility. After learning of the arrest of two Israeli IDF soldiers in the reserves accused of similar offenses, Buchbaza reportedly deleted his exchanges with the Iranian handler, only to reestablish contact later. At one point, he warned his handler of an pending Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites, claiming he had inside knowledge. Shin Bet and police issued a joint warning following Buchbaza’s indictment, urging citizens not to engage with unknown foreign contacts, particularly those linked to enemy states. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Iranian intelligence and terrorist operatives continue efforts to recruit Israelis for espionage and security-related tasks,' the statement said, highlighting social media as a primary recruitment tool. 'Israeli security agencies will continue to identify and thwart Iranian operations and will ensure those involved face the full extent of the law.'

One wrong move could seal their fate': Hostage families speak ou...	Families shocked by developments, fear for loved ones after Israel halts humanitarian aid and goods into enclalve, warning talks deadlock risks captives' lives Hours after the first phase of the hostage deal expired, families of captives expressed growing concerns for their loved ones, fearing that stalled negotiations and escalating tensions could put them at greater risk. Their fears were amplified by Hamas’ refusal to accept a U.S.-backed framework for extending the cease-fire in exchange for the immediate release of half of the remaining hostages. The situation became even more uncertain after Israel, with U.S. backing, announced it was halting humanitarian aid to Gaza. According to Al Jazeera, the decision followed an Israeli demand for Hamas to release five living hostages and the bodies of 10 others in exchange for increased humanitarian assistance—an offer the group rejected. The announcement came as a shock to many families, who fear their loved ones could be harmed by the breakdown in negotiations. 'Everything is fragile, freigtning and dangerous' For Merav Gilboa Dalal, whose son Guy Dalal remains in captivity, the uncertainty is overwhelming. She learned about the aid suspension during a live interview with Israeli media. 'I need to process what you just told me,' she said. 'Everything is so fragile, frightening, and dangerous. This is very difficult to hear.' Her anguish was compounded by a video Hamas released a week earlier, showing her son alongside another hostage, Evyatar David, watching one of the earlier hostage releases. 'The longing for Guy, especially after that horrifying video, is unbearable,' she said. 'We hold onto hope. We know Guy will come home—that belief is what carries us through.' Dalal described her son as 'a symbol of someone abducted from a festival of peace and love' and accused Hamas of psychological torment. 'In the video, they made it seem like they were about to be released, only to take them back underground. It was meant to break them mentally. But it’s moving to see the bond formed among the captives—they are truly looking out for one another.' The uncertainty has also shaken Maccabit Meir, the aunt of kidnapped brothers Gali and Ziv Berman. 'We are in a bottomless pit. Everything is volatile, fragile. In a split second, this nightmare could take an irreversible turn for Gali, Ziv, and all the others left behind,' she said. Meir referenced testimony from former hostage Eli Sharabi, who described his captivity in a recent television interview. 'His courage, his superhuman strength—he survived and returned from hell. His testimony must be aired constantly, in the Knesset, in the media. This is the reality for everyone still held captive.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: She also voiced concerns about Israel’s priorities. 'I fear that the hostages are no longer the government’s top priority. I want to believe that phase two of the deal will move forward. I want to believe negotiations will continue. I can’t even fathom a return to fighting now—it would seal their fate.' Red Cross defends role amid criticism The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which has played a key role in facilitating hostage releases, has faced increasing scrutiny over its actions. 'We are a neutral and non-political organization. We interpret events based on international law,' said Gilad Grossman, the Red Cross' spokesperson in Israel. 'Our mission is to assist civilians in conflict zones.' Addressing Israel’s decision to halt humanitarian aid, Grossman said, 'Humanitarian aid saves lives. We have repeatedly spoken about the urgent need for it. While we are not in a position to determine whether this constitutes deliberate starvation, there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.' One of the primary criticisms against the ICRC has been its failure to secure access to the hostages, who are reportedly being held in dire conditions. 'We have not been able to reach the hostages in Gaza,' Grossman admitted. 'We have consistently declared that they must be released unconditionally. The Red Cross has been trying for more than 500 days to gain access to them, to allow them contact with their families and to provide medical care. We do not conduct these efforts publicly. But the reality is clear—we have not succeeded.' Grossman also rejected accusations that the Red Cross has equated the Israeli hostages with Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. 'At no point did we attempt to create symmetry between the two sides,' he said. 'Those who are released have rights, and their dignity must be respected, but we never equated the two situations.' Regarding Alon Ahel, an Israeli hostage reportedly suffering from a severe eye injury, Grossman was unequivocal. 'He should not be there at all. His detention is a violation of international law. We continue to work to gain access to him and the other hostages.' Since the war began, Grossman said, 'more than 140 individuals have been released through our facilitation. This is humanitarian work at the most extreme level, and we will continue until the last hostage is home.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s11qdp11ske	2025-03-02T03:59:20-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/01/BkehesRlikl/BkehesRlikl_0_83_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Released hostage tried to spare family of heartrenching separatio...	Ruth Strom whose son Iair returned from captivity and his younger brother remained in Gaza says she expected their parting to be difficult, released horrific video posted by Hamas for all to see and understand what the hotages are enduring Ruth Strom, whose son Iair Horn was released from Hamas captivity while his brother Eitan remains in Gaza, said Sunday that Iair never told the family about the Hamas video showing their forced separation. The footage, released Saturday, shows the brothers embracing before Iair’s release two weeks ago, after 498 days in captivity, while Eitan remains imprisoned — now for 513 days. 'Iair didn’t tell us they filmed them. He wanted to protect us, but I knew something like this would happen. From the start, I knew they were together. I imagined their goodbye,' Strom told Ynet in an interview. When asked why the family agreed to the video’s publication, she said there was no hesitation. 'Everyone needs to see and know what our hostages are going through. They need to see that so many of them are still alive and must be brought home. There’s no time. Even those who aren’t alive deserve a proper burial so their families have a grave to visit.' She described her son’s appearance in the footage: 'I thought Eitan would be thinner, but he looks okay overall — it’s all a show. I saw his wounds from his illness, the one he had before he was taken. This is not the place for him. It’s not the place for anyone.' 'Every time they cut humanitarian aid, they take away the little that our hostages still have,' the mother said after Israel’s decision to halt humanitarian aid to Gaza on Sunday. 'I would have done things differently, asked for other things but what I want most is my Eitan and all the hostages home. They must do everything. This happened on their watch, they abandoned us and they must bring them all back — now.' She vowed to continue fighting for their release. 'I’m not stopping. I don’t know where I find the strength but somehow, someone is watching over me.' Strom added Iair, now back in Israel, is in good health but struggling emotionally. 'He won’t be able to heal until Eitan is here.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Hamas video features several hostages, including Iair and Eitan Horn, as well as Sagui Dekel-Chen, who was released with Iair. Two other hostages’ faces were blurred but one was identified as Nimrod Cohen by his tattoo. In the video, Eitan says: 'I’m happy my brother is being freed tomorrow but separating families is inhumane. Get everyone out. Don’t destroy our lives. I don’t even know how I’m speaking calmly right now. 'My brother is leaving and I’m staying behind, hearing that you don’t want to proceed with the next phase [of the hostage deal]. Are you insane? What have you been doing for a year and a half? How many more people have to die? Sign the deal. Stop the war, stop the death, stop destroying lives.' 'I eat and drink sometimes. I’m okay, but I’m not okay,' he added. 'Hamas is keeping me alive, but that’s enough — get me out. Get us all out. I can’t stay here. Enough. [Benjamin] Netanyahu, if you have a shred of a heart, sign the deal today.' He then turns to his brother Iair before their forced separation: 'Tell Mom, tell Dad, tell everyone to keep protesting. Don’t stop until the government signs the second phase and gets us all home. Do everything.' Iair responds: 'You’re telling me to leave my little brother here to die?' It should be noted Hamas is known to coerce hostages into making statements as part of its psychological warfare strategy against Israel. The Horn family issued a statement following the video’s release: 'Our hearts are breaking seeing Eitan in this horrific situation — watching his brother gain freedom while he remains trapped in Hamas’ hell after 512 days. You can see the despair and fear in his eyes.' 'Since Iair came home, he hasn’t stopped thinking and fighting for Eitan and the other hostages left behind. We demand that decision-makers look Eitan in the eyes and not stop the deal that has already brought dozens of hostages home. Time has run out. Bring them all back — now, in one phase.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj3v7nzije	2025-03-02T03:56:24-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/01/SyZLN4iljkl/SyZLN4iljkl_274_23_1647_928_0_small.jpg

The plan, introduced by U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff, called for the immediate release of half of the remaining hostages—both living and deceased—on the first day, with the rest freed if negotiations led to a permanent cease-fire. Hamas rejected a separate Israeli proposal that included the release of five living hostages and the bodies of 10 others in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and increased humanitarian aid, according to the Qatari based Al Jazeera network.

UK, France and Ukraine agree to work on ceasefire plan for Russia...	Britain, France and Ukraine have agreed to work on a ceasefire plan to present to the United States, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Sunday as he prepared to host a summit of European leaders. The summit has been overshadowed by the extraordinary scolding by U.S. President Donald Trump of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday for being ungrateful for U.S. support in Ukraine's battle against the invasion by Russia. But Starmer said he's focused on being a bridge to restore peace talks and use the collapse of talks as an opportunity to re-engage with Trump and Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron rather than 'ramp up the rhetoric.' 'We've now agreed that the United Kingdom, along with France and possibly one or two others, will work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting, and then we'll discuss that plan with the United States,' Starmer told the BBC.

Thousands line roads honoring slain hostage Shlomo Mansour, oldes...	People carrying flags come out as funeral procession makes its way to Kibbutz Kissufim; 85-year-old Shlomo Mansour taken by Hamas terrorists in handcuffs during the massacre Former Israeli hostage Shlomo Mansour was being laid to rest on Sunday following the return of his body from Gaza as part of the hostage deal with Hamas. Thousands of Israelis attended his funeral procession carrying Israeli and yellow flags symbolizing the hostages remaining in Hamas' hands. Mansour, 85, was the oldest hostage held in Gaza. He was kidnapped on October 7 from his home in Kibbutz Kissufim, when terrorists took him and handcuffed him. His wife Mazal begged for her life and managed to escape. About two weeks ago, the kibbutz announced that it had been informed by the IDF that Shlomo had been murdered on October 7 and his body taken into Gaza. He is survived by five children and 12 grandchildren. Hadassah Lazar, Shlomo Mansour's sister, last week confirmed that the family had been notified of the official identification of his remains at the National Center for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv.

'For us, Shlomo was the heart of our community—the grandfather to everyone,' the kibbutz said in a statement. 'Always with a warm smile, never forgetting a single birthday, always calling to say 'mazal tov.' He had a rare gift of making each person feel like they were the center of his world, through his warmth, kindness and selfless presence. His memory will stay with us forever.

Disgraced NY governor eyes mayoral race, cheered by pro-Israel vo...	Andrew Cuomo launches a bid for mayor, directly challenging Eric Adams and positioning himself as the leading pro-Israel candidate in a race where support for the Jewish state has become a defining issue Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York, has officially thrown his hat into the ring for the city’s mayoral race, marking an audacious comeback attempt three years after stepping down in disgrace. His entry not only shakes up the race against incumbent Mayor Eric Adams but also provides a potential lifeline for pro-Israel voters, who had grown increasingly uneasy about Adams’ sinking approval ratings and the alternatives in the Democratic primary. Cuomo, long known for his aggressive political style, is stepping into a field where support for Israel has become a significant dividing line. As governor, he positioned himself as a staunch ally of the Jewish state, visiting Israel three times while in office and signing an executive order in 2016 barring New York from doing business with entities that support the BDS movement. He reinforced this stance in 2019 when he ordered the World Trade Center to be illuminated in blue and white in honor of Israel’s Independence Day. More recently, he founded the 'Progressives for Israel' group, calling himself 'Shabbos goy' and explicitly challenging what he sees as a waning commitment to Israel among left-leaning Democrats. 'The Shabbos goy can do the work that benefits both the Jewish community and the non-Jewish community to speak out first and loudest against antisemitism', Cuomo said. Cuomo’s deep ties to New York politics stretch far beyond his own career. He is the son of the late Mario Cuomo, who served as governor of New York for three terms and was revered for his progressive vision and powerful oratory. His brother, Chris Cuomo, is a former CNN anchor who was fired after revelations that he advised the governmor during his sexual harassment scandal. Despite these controversies, the Cuomo name still carries significant weight in New York’s political landscape, especially among older Democratic voters who remember Mario Cuomo’s legacy fondly. By contrast, some of Cuomo’s leading opponents in the race have taken a more critical stance on Israel. Among them is NYC Comptroller Brad Lander, a progressive Jewish Democrat who has consistently voiced opposition to Israeli policies and has aligned himself with the city’s left-wing activists. Lander supported early cease-fire calls following the October 7 attacks and previously backed efforts to distance New York from corporations with ties to Israeli settlements. Another rising candidate, State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, has gone even further, openly endorsing the BDS movement and leading efforts to cut state funding to charities linked to West Bank settlements. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Mamdani's rhetoric following the October 7 massacre in Israel has alarmed Jewish leaders, who view his candidacy as a direct threat to the city’s traditionally strong support for the Jewish state. Other candidates include Scott Stringer, the former city comptroller whose 2021 mayoral bid was badly hindered by allegations of sexual misconduct. Stringer, a Jewish politician with deep ties to Manhattan’s Upper West Side, has tried to rebuild his reputation and remains a formidable presence in the race. Meanwhile, Brooklyn State Senator Zellnor Myrie is running as a progressive reformer, focusing on issues of racial justice and economic inequality. Though Myrie has not been as vocal as Lander or Mamdani on Israel, he has aligned himself with left-wing coalitions that have grown increasingly critical of the Jewish state. For Adams, who has consistently branded himself as a friend of Israel and a defender of the city’s Jewish population, Cuomo’s entry into the race is a serious problem. The incumbent mayor’s tenure has been marred by declining public trust, federal corruption investigations, and increasing dissatisfaction over crime and housing costs. While Adams remains popular in certain Orthodox Jewish communities that played a crucial role in his 2021 victory, his political troubles have left many in the pro-Israel camp searching for a viable alternative. Cuomo is now positioning himself as that alternative. His campaign is expected to double down on his credentials as a law-and-order moderate and a steadfast supporter of Israel. He has already secured the endorsement of Rep. Ritchie Torres, one of the most vocal pro-Israel Democrats in Congress, who framed Cuomo as a necessary counterbalance to what he calls 'radical elements' in the party. The challenge for Cuomo, however, is that his past remains a political minefield. His resignation in 2021 followed multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denies. He also faced criticism for his administration’s handling of COVID-19 in nursing homes, an issue that still lingers in the minds of many voters. Some in the Orthodox Jewish community, in particular, have not forgotten how his restrictions on religious gatherings during the pandemic disproportionately affected their neighborhoods. Yet, in a field where Adams is weakened and the alternatives include candidates with anti-Israel track records, Cuomo’s bid may resonate with voters who prioritize a strong pro-Israel stance. If he can successfully rebrand himself as the best option for the city’s sizable Jewish electorate, he may not only survive the political comeback attempt but reshape the race entirely. The battle for City Hall is now a high-stakes contest not just for New York’s future, but for the broader fight over Israel’s standing within the Democratic Party. With Cuomo in the race, the city’s pro-Israel voters may find themselves with a powerful, if controversial, champion. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sywhldzi1l	2025-03-01T23:29:46-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2017/06/02/7819610/7819610_1_49_980_552_0_small.jpg

Israeli general dismisses rumors of imminent Egyptian military th...	Brig. Gen. Itamar Ben Chaim reassures residents living near the border with Egypt amid concerns over reported military buildup in Sinai Brig. Gen. Itamar Ben Chaim, commander of the IDF's 80th Division said there is no threat of war with Egypt. The general met with residents living near the Israeli-Egyptian border and sought to dispel concerns over unverified reports suggesting that Egypt was preparing for an attack from the Sinai Peninsula, adding that that the IDF was not making preparations for it. 'The scenario in which the Egyptian army launches an attack in this area— we are not preparing for it because we do not believe it is a realistic scenario in the immediate future,' Ben Chaim said in recordings obtained by ynet. His remarks come as the IDF investigates the sources behind widespread rumors that Egypt’s military is conducting large-scale exercises in Sinai ahead of an alleged surprise attack on Israel. Addressing these claims for the first time, Ben Chaim firmly rejected them. The 80th Division, responsible for securing Israel’s border with Sinai, operates under the constraints of the 1979 Israel-Egypt peace treaty, which limits Egyptian military presence in the peninsula unless Israel grants special permission, such as for operations against ISIS or tunnel destruction near Gaza. During the meeting, one resident confronted Ben Chaim, drawing parallels to the intelligence failures exposed in recent investigations into the October 7 Hamas attack, particularly regarding gaps between enemy capabilities and intentions. Notably, Egypt has significantly bolstered its military capabilities in recent years. Ben Chaim acknowledged these concerns but emphasized the importance of Israel’s peace agreement with Egypt. 'You should take an interest in the agreement,' he said, explaining that Israel must allocate military resources across multiple fronts, including the West Bank, Lebanon, Gaza, and Jordan. 'We assess the threats we face. I do not believe that an attack, as described here, will occur in the near future, meaning in the coming years. If such a decision is made, we will know how to prepare.' Despite Ben Chaim’s reassurances, activists criticized the IDF’s approach, accusing it of ignoring a potential threat. 'The IDF is taking serious risks at the expense of residents and dismissing the clear danger before our eyes,' the group Otef Yisrael Forum, representing hundreds of residents in Israeli communities near Gaza, said in a statement. They pointed to recent remarks by IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, who reportedly warned that Egypt’s posture could shift rapidly and that Israel is closely monitoring the situation. 'The military must listen to the public rather than dismiss our concerns,' the statement continued. 'Before October 7, our warnings were ignored, and we were fed false security assumptions that led to disaster. The minimum demand should be for Egypt to withdraw its forces from northern Sinai.' Rumors about a potential Egyptian military buildup, despite the peace treaty, have been spreading in recent weeks, particularly among right-wing circles and online forums, fueling unease among Israelis. Adding to the controversy, Israel’s ambassador to the U.S., Yehiel Leiter, made a rare public statement last month, accusing Egypt of violating the peace agreement. 'Egypt is building offensive military bases, and we have turned a blind eye for a long time. But this continues. It is a clear violation. This is an issue we will bring to the table in the near future,' Leiter said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: A video of his remarks was swiftly removed from the internet, without confirmation or denial from Israel’s Foreign Ministry, but not before it drew criticism from Cairo. The IDF has yet to respond to the matter. However, in an official statement, the military’s spokesperson said: 'The division commander presented residents with key aspects of the situation assessment, operational efforts, and the division’s preparedness for all potential threats, in accordance with priority considerations.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkzpef11jjx	2025-03-01T22:50:36-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/19/BkURrOcvkx/BkURrOcvkx_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Israel halts humanitarian aid to Gaza, closes all border crossing...	In a statemnt government says move comes after Hamas refuses to accept the Witkoff framework for continuting negotiations; the decison was made in coordination with the United States ; Hamas say Israel decides to starve people of Gaza Israel on Sunday stopped the supply of humanitarian aid into the Gaza strip and closed all border crossings. The decision by the government came hours after the first phase of the cease-fire agreement with Hamas expired amid a crisis in the talks to extend it and bring about the release of more hostages held by the terror group. 'With the completion of the first phase of the hostage deal and in light of Hamas's refusal to accept the Witkoff framework for continuing negotiations—which Israel had agreed to—Prime Minister Netanyahu has decided that, as of this morning, the entry of all goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will be halted,' the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said in a statement. The cease-fire proposal put forward by Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy, which calls for a temporary truce during Ramadan and Passover, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced late Saturday. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Under the plan, half of the remaining hostages—both living and deceased—would be released on the first day.

Eli Sharabi held hostage for 491 days recounts in interview the struggle of captives to survive, says was bound in chains, starved and subjected to physical violence by Hamas U.S. President Donald Trump has invited freed hostage Eli Sharabi to the White House, his brother Sharon Sharabi said Sunday. The invitation came after Trump watched an interview on Israel's Channel 12 Ovda program, in which Sharabi spoke about his captivity and his hope for the release of the remaining hostages. 'We are flying on Monday for a meeting with the president on Tuesday,' Sharon Sharabi said. 'It is the vital, present need,' he added, as cease-fire talks remain stalled and 59 hostages are still held in Gaza. Sharabi was held by Hamas for 491 days. After his release, he learned that his wife and two daughters were murdered in the Oct. 7 massacre and that his brother, Yossi, died in captivity. Sharabi was released last month along with Or Levy and Ohad Ben Ami. Their condition, having lost so much weight, alarmed Israelis and prompted an angry reaction from the president and other top administration officials. 'They looked like Holocaust survivors,' Trump said. In the interview, Sharabi recalled how he and his wife chose not to resist their captors to protect their daughters. While in captivity, he was led to believe his family had survived. Only upon his release did he learn the tragic truth.

Rubio signs declaration to expedite delivery of $4 billion in mil...	Since taking office the Trump admiinistration approved nearly $12 billion in military aid to Israel; Secretary of State says using emergency authority to expedite the delivery U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Saturday he had signed a declaration to expedite delivery of approximately $4 billion in military assistance to Israel. The Trump administration, which took office on January 20, has approved nearly $12 billion in major foreign military sales to Israel, Rubio said in a statement, adding that it 'will continue to use all available tools to fulfill America's long-standing commitment to Israel's security, including means to counter security threats.' Rubio said he had used emergency authority to expedite the delivery of military assistance to Israel to its Middle East ally, now in a fragile ceasefire with Hamas militants in their war in Gaza. The Pentagon said on Friday that the State Department had approved the potential sale of nearly $3 billion worth of bombs, demolition kits and other weaponry to Israel. The administration notified Congress of those prospective weapons sales on an emergency basis, sidestepping a long-standing practice of giving the chairs and ranking members of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations Committees the opportunity to review the sale and ask for more information before making a formal notification to Congress. Friday's announcements marked the second time in recent weeks that President Donald Trump's administration has declared an emergency to quickly approve weapons sales to Israel. The Biden administration also used emergency authority to approve the sale of arms to Israel without congressional review. On Monday, the Trump administration rescinded a Biden-era order requiring it to report potential violations of international law involving U.S.-supplied weapons by allies, including Israel. It has also eliminated most U.S. humanitarian foreign aid. The January 19 Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement halted 15 months of fighting and paved the way for talks on ending the war, while leading to the release of 44 Israeli hostages held in Gaza and around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel. Hours after the first phase of the agreed ceasefire was set to expire, Israel said early on Sunday it would adopt a proposal by Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza for the Ramadan and Passover periods. Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the ceasefire, casting doubt over the second phase of the deal meant to include releases of additional hostages and prisoners as well as steps toward a permanent end of the war.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyjxwdbojx	2025-03-01T20:18:27-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/16/SJ7EjcP19Je/SJ7EjcP19Je_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Hamas Demands Implementation Of Second Ceasefire Phase: Statement	Hamas said Sunday it insists on the implementation of a second ceasefire phase after Israel endorsed a temporary extension of the initial phase. 'The only way to achieve stability in the region and the return of the prisoners is to complete the implementation of the agreement... starting with the implementation of the second phase,' Hamas leader Mahmoud Mardawi said in a statement given to AFP.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bye00pwzoyl	2025-03-01T20:07:21-08:00

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Saturday he had signed a declaration to expedite delivery of approximately $4 billion in military assistance to Israel.

Israel backs US cease-fire plan for Ramadan and Passover, accuses...	Proposal put forward by Witkoff calls for release of half remaining hostages upfront and rest if permanent truce reached; 'If Hamas changes its position, Israel will immediately engage in negotiations to finalize the Witkoff framework' Israel has agreed to a cease-fire proposal put forward by Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy, which calls for a temporary truce during Ramadan and Passover, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced late Saturday. Under the plan, half of the remaining hostages—both living and deceased—would be released on the first day. If negotiations lead to a permanent cease-fire, the remaining hostages would be freed by the deal’s conclusion. According to Netanyahu’s office, Witkoff proposed the framework after assessing that the gaps between Israel and Hamas remain too wide for an immediate resolution to the war and that additional time is needed for negotiations. 'While Hamas has repeatedly violated past agreements, Israel has not breached any terms,' the statement said, adding that Israel retains the right to resume military operations after 42 days if it deems negotiations ineffective. 'If Hamas changes its position, Israel will immediately engage in negotiations to finalize the Witkoff framework.' Despite Israel’s agreement to the proposal, an Israeli official said the country is 'closer to resuming military action than to securing a cease-fire.' The official stressed that no truce would proceed without further hostage releases. Israel is expected to give negotiations a few more days before considering a return to combat operations, with Netanyahu’s government awaiting Witkoff’s arrival in the Middle East later in the week after a delay in his planned visit. Meanwhile, the IDF has begun preparations for a potential return to fighting, increasing readiness along the Gaza border and deploying additional forces to strategic locations. The IDF is also preparing for a renewed ground offensive, with combat divisions training for urban warfare against Hamas’ remaining infrastructure, including tunnels, explosive-laden streets and fortified strongholds. Military officials have cautioned the government that any renewed offensive would need to be conducted with constraints, given intelligence indicating that dozens of Israeli hostages remain in specific areas of Gaza. Both sides, according to analysts, have entered a tense standoff over who will make the next move—whether negotiations will resume or hostilities will reignite.

Of them, 24 are classified as alive, with Israeli intelligence estimating that 22 are indeed still alive, while 35 are believed to be deceased. On Saturday morning, Hamas announced it was rejecting an extension of Phase I 'under the conditions proposed by Israel.' Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told Qatar’s Al-Araby network that 'there is currently no negotiation regarding a second phase, and Israel bears full responsibility.' He accused Israel of seeking to recover hostages while maintaining the option to resume attacks on Gaza and of 'evading a commitment to ending the war and fully withdrawing from the Strip.' Netanyahu held a rare Friday evening consultation following the return of Israel’s negotiating team from Cairo, where talks failed to progress due to Hamas’ insistence on an Israeli withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor as a condition for further negotiations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sywpfbwoke	2025-03-01T13:42:52-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/24/Hyy8hLc5kx/Hyy8hLc5kx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced late Saturday that Israel has agreed to a cease-fire framework proposed by Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy, which would pause fighting during Ramadan and Passover. According to the statement, under the plan, half of the remaining hostages—both living and deceased—would be released on the first day of the agreement. If negotiations lead to a permanent cease-fire, the remaining hostages would be freed by the end of the arrangement. The statement also noted that under the deal, Israel retains the right to resume military operations after 42 days if it determines that negotiations are not progressing effectively.

Israel strengthens ties with Russia in bid to curb Turkish influe...	Jerusalem deepening security coordination with Moscow while working to curb Turkish influence in post-Assad Syria; amid rising tensions, Netanyahu authorizes military action against jihadist forces and urges Moscow to pressure Hamas for hostage talks As tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky escalated to unprecedented levels on Friday, Israel is quietly reassessing its own strategic partnerships. Ynet has learned that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dispatched his military secretary, Maj. Gen. Roman Gofman, to Moscow in recent days for a series of security and diplomatic meetings aimed at strengthening cooperation while safeguarding Israel’s strategic interests. Gofman, who returned from Moscow on Friday, is considered one of Netanyahu’s closest advisors—particularly given the prime minister’s strained relations with outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar, whom Netanyahu has threatened to dismiss. Gofman has also been sent on similar secret missions to other locations in recent weeks. Israel’s stance on Syria is becoming increasingly clear: it prefers Russian influence over Turkey’s expanding foothold and is actively working to curb Ankara’s involvement. One key objective of the Moscow meetings was to urge Russia to pressure Hamas—through intermediaries—to advance negotiations for the release of Israeli hostages. Among those still held captive in Gaza is Maxim Herkin, a dual Israeli-Russian citizen. Israel is also deeply concerned about hostile actors consolidating power in post-Assad Syria. Netanyahu has already ramped up pressure, publicly demanding the demilitarization of southern Syria. According to Reuters, Israel is urging the U.S. to ensure Syria remains 'weak,' including by allowing Russia to maintain its military bases there—effectively countering Turkey’s efforts to forge a security alliance with Syria’s new ruling power. Israel seeks to block Turkish-Syrian military pact Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to host Syria’s new president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, leader of the jihadist rebel factions that toppled Assad. Their discussions are set to focus on establishing Turkish military bases, training Syria’s reconstituted armed forces, and securing the country’s airspace. Israel views these developments as a direct threat and is working to thwart them, preferring Russian dominance in Syria over Turkish influence. During an IDF officers’ graduation ceremony last week, Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel’s military presence in key areas of Lebanon and Syria. 'We demand the full demilitarization of southern Syria from forces of the new regime. We will also not tolerate any threats to the Druze population in southern Syria,' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Netanyahu also declared that Israeli forces would remain stationed at Mount Hermon and the buffer zone for an indefinite period to safeguard Israeli communities and deter emerging threats. 'We will not allow forces of HTS [Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the now-defunct jihadist group led by Sharaa] or the new Syrian army to enter the area south of Damascus,' he said. Within 24 hours of Netanyahu’s remarks, the IDF launched airstrikes on Syrian military positions in Syria. Defense Minister Israel Katz later confirmed the strikes, saying: 'The Air Force struck forcefully in southern Syria as part of our new policy to demilitarize the region.' He added, 'Our message is clear: We will not allow southern Syria to turn into another southern Lebanon. We will not jeopardize our citizens’ security.' Despite its security coordination with Moscow, Israel harbors no illusions about the Kremlin’s allegiances. Russia maintains a strategic alliance with Iran, including backing Tehran’s civilian nuclear program, and has recently adopted a pro-Hamas stance. Since October 7, Russian President Vladimir Putin has refused to condemn Hamas for its attack on Israel, instead blaming Israel’s settlement policies and later accusing Jerusalem of committing 'massacres against Palestinians.' Meanwhile, Israel has refrained from offering full support to Ukraine, despite Ukrainian President Zelensky’s vocal backing of Israel following the Hamas onslaught. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyzr6ybj1g	2025-03-01T11:40:40-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/01/SJ8amTlike/SJ8amTlike_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Israel warns Syria against attacking Druze as tensions simmer nea...	Netanyahu and Katz warn Syrian regime against attacking minority as fighting rages in Jaramana, vowing IDF action if Druze harmed; Israel delivers aid to Druze in Quneitra Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a rare warning to the Syrian government on Saturday, vowing to retaliate if it harms Druze residents in the city of Jaramana, about five miles from Damascus. 'We will not allow the extremist Islamist regime in Syria to harm the Druze. If the regime harms them, it will face consequences from us,' Netanyahu and Katz said in a joint statement. The two leaders said they had instructed the IDF to prepare and deliver a strong warning to Damascus. 'We are committed to our Druze brothers in Israel and will do everything necessary to protect their relatives in Syria,' they added. Jaramana, a mixed Druze-Christian city near Damascus, is in a vulnerable position. Unlike the Druze stronghold of Sweida in southern Syria—where the community is more independent and armed—the Druze of Jaramana lack the ability to defend themselves. Israel has closely monitored the situation, concerned that Syria’s new leadership could test the Druze population’s standing, making it a red line for Jerusalem. Earlier on Saturday, Syrian reports indicated that the IDF had facilitated the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Druze village of Khadr in Syria’s Quneitra province. The aid, organized by Israel’s Druze religious council, was partially delivered, with more expected to follow. The packages are designated for villages near the Israeli border, with additional shipments planned for other areas. Meanwhile, Syrian reports detailed clashes between security forces and Druze groups in Jaramana. According to Arab media, Syria’s General Intelligence Directorate launched a security operation in the area after one of its operatives was killed by armed men. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based opposition group, reported multiple incidents in the city, including an attack on a vehicle carrying Druze civilians, leaving several wounded. The circumstances surrounding the shooting remain unclear. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hussam al-Tahan, head of Damascus’ rural security administration, a government body, claimed that security officers were attacked when they tried to enter Jaramana. 'They were stopped at a checkpoint manned by the Jaramana Shield group and were denied entry with their weapons. After handing over their weapons, they were beaten, humiliated and fired upon. One officer was killed instantly, and another was wounded and taken by the checkpoint personnel,' he alleged. Syrian officials have reportedly given Jaramana’s armed groups five days to surrender their weapons and remove the checkpoints. Al Jazeera reported that mediation efforts have begun between Jaramana residents and Syrian security services 'to contain the tensions.' A local resident, Rabih Manzar, told the Qatari network, 'We are Arab Syrians, loyal to our country and we did not ask for protection from anyone. The Syrian government will respond to Netanyahu—we will not allow ourselves to be used.' Israel’s diplomatic moves in Moscow As tensions in Syria mount, Netanyahu has dispatched his military secretary, Maj. Gen. Roman Gofman, to Moscow for a series of high-level security and diplomatic meetings. One of Israel’s key concerns is Turkey’s growing influence in Syria. Israel has taken a clear stance, favoring Russian interests over Turkish influence in the region. The meetings in Moscow were also aimed at urging Russia to pressure Hamas, through intermediaries, to advance negotiations for a hostage release deal. One of the Israeli hostages still held in Gaza, Maxim Herkin, holds Russian citizenship. Against the backdrop of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s ousting and Israel’s push to demilitarize southern Syria, Jerusalem has been pressing the United States to ensure Syria remains 'weak,' in part by allowing Russia to maintain its military presence there. According to a Reuters report citing four sources familiar with the discussions, Israel is seeking to counter Turkey’s influence over Syria’s new ruling forces. The report also noted that while jihadist groups led by Syrian leader Ahmad al-Sharaa—who played a role in Assad’s downfall—are lobbying the U.S. to lift sanctions against them, Israel has communicated its concerns about emerging threats in Syria to American officials. Three U.S. sources told Reuters that Israel views Turkey’s close ties with Syria’s ruling factions as problematic. Other sources confirmed that Israel has conveyed its stance in meetings and official documents. However, it remains unclear whether the Trump administration supports Israel’s position, as Washington has largely remained silent on the matter. According to the sources, some U.S. officials were surprised when Israel framed Russia’s continued military presence in Syria in a positive light. 'Turkey, as a NATO member, would be a better guarantor of Israel’s security,' some officials reportedly argued. However, Israeli representatives at the meeting firmly rejected that notion. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1c8p1bjke	2025-03-01T11:23:37-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/22/BJmudgIS1x/BJmudgIS1x_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Jewish power at the polls: Inside the Zionist election	American Zionist Movement Executive Director Herbert Block explains the upcoming World Zionist Congress elections American Zionist Movement Executive Director Herbert Block defines Zionism as the Jewish people’s right to self-determination 'and to have our national homeland in our ancestral land.' The word 'Zionism' has been under attack for decades. Following the October 7 massacre and the ongoing war, the anti-Zionist movement has become increasingly vocal. Many Jews, especially on college campuses, are now hesitant to openly identify as Zionists due to rising hostility. However, in an interview with the ILTV News Podcast, Block made it clear that Zionism is here to stay. 'You can’t take Zionism out of our people, our tradition,' Block said. 'Jews around the world, for millennia, have been talking about Zion.' This year, Zionism will take center stage in Jewish discourse for another reason: the upcoming World Zionist Congress elections. These elections determine Zionist Jewish leadership worldwide and influence priorities and funding allocations for the next five years. For those unfamiliar with the process, it can seem complex. Block helped break it down on the podcast. He leads AZM, the umbrella Zionist federation in the United States and the American arm of the World Zionist Organization. Under AZM’s umbrella are 46 national Jewish organizations, and nearly 40 countries have similar Zionist organizations. The World Zionist Organization (WZO) is one of the Jewish people’s legacy institutions. Founded by Theodor Herzl, it organized the first Zionist Congress in Basel in 1897. Today, it works alongside Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael, the Jewish Agency, and Keren Hayesod—three institutions considered the 'national institutions of Israel.' Together, they bridge the connection between Israel and Jews in the Diaspora. The World Zionist Congress serves as the parliament of the Jewish people, with members elected globally. Unlike many Jewish organizations, representation in the Congress is not based on financial contributions. Instead, it is a 'grassroots convening of representatives of Jewish communities, both in Israel and around the world,' Block explained. 'It’s what was formed by Herzl. And now, this year in October, we’ll meet for the 39th Zionist Congress, following in Herzl’s footsteps.' Watch previous ILTV News Podcasts: Delegates gather every five years to set the agenda and direction for these national institutions. These organizations existed before Israel’s founding and remain integral to Herzl’s vision—keeping Jews in Israel and the Diaspora connected and advancing the Zionist cause. They continue to support Jewish communities worldwide, promote Zionist and Jewish education, and fund various initiatives that impact Jews across the globe. Voting for the slates that will be represented in the World Zionist Congress opens in March. Five years ago, 14 parties ran in the elections. This year, in the wake of October 7, that number has risen to 21. 'We're hopeful there will be a greater turnout this time,' Block told ILTV. In the last election, around 125,000 voters participated in North America, despite millions of eligible Jewish voters over the age of 18. 'We're hoping that among affiliated Jews, there will be a greater turnout.' Block stressed the importance of voting, as these national institutions allocate more than a billion dollars annually. Delegates play a key role in determining how those funds are distributed. 'To be represented and have your priorities reflected, voting is essential,' he said. 'This election is an opportunity for people to stand up, unite around Zionism, and connect to the community,' Block emphasized. 'I’m a Zionist, and that’s what this election is about—affirming your Zionism and representing your views on the Zionist movement. We’re all bound together as a Jewish people.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjyorkj5yx	2025-03-01T09:04:20-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/25/SJuLwyjqJe/SJuLwyjqJe_0_161_2500_1408_0_small.jpg
Could the US push for Zelensky’s ouster? Ukraine’s future uncerta...	After White House thrashing, Ukrainian leader travels to London for talks on military aid and possible cease-fire; Moscow seizes on fallout, describing 'war obsessed' Zelensky's visit to Washington as 'diplomatic failure' In a symbolic move, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky flew to London on Saturday, just hours after his heated and public confrontation with U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance at the White House. Zelensky is set to meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who will lead a special summit with European leaders to discuss the ongoing war. The talks will focus not only on continued military and economic aid for Ukraine but also on whether European nations would be willing, as part of a potential cease-fire agreement, to deploy troops to Ukraine to monitor and enforce a truce if one is reached. Amid tensions with the White House following Trump’s sharp criticism during their Oval Office meeting, Zelensky issued a statement emphasizing Ukraine’s gratitude toward the U.S. 'We are very grateful to the United States for all the support,' Zelensky wrote. 'I’m thankful to President Trump, Congress for their bipartisan support, and American people. Ukrainians have always appreciated this support, especially during these three years of full-scale invasion. America’s help has been vital in helping us survive, and I want to acknowledge that.' Despite what he described as 'tough dialogue,' Zelensky insisted that Ukraine and the U.S. remain strategic partners. '[W]e need to be honest and direct with each other to truly understand our shared goals,' he wrote. 'It’s crucial for us to have President Trump’s support. He wants to end the war, but no one wants peace more than we do. We are the ones living this war in Ukraine. It’s a fight for our freedom, for our very survival... We’re talking about just and lasting peace—freedom, justice, and human rights for everyone.' Zelensky cast doubt on the viability of a cease-fire with Russian President Vladimir Putin, arguing that temporary truces had repeatedly failed. 'He has broken ceasefires 25 times over the last ten years. A real peace is the only solution,' he said. He reaffirmed Ukraine’s willingness to sign a minerals agreement, calling it 'the first step toward security guarantees,' but stressed that such a move alone would not be enough. 'A ceasefire without security guarantees is dangerous for Ukraine,' he warned. Zelensky also sought to reassure Ukrainians about continued U.S. support. 'We’ve been fighting for 3 years, and Ukrainian people need to know that America is on our side,' he said. However, the extent to which relations between Zelensky and Trump can recover remains uncertain. A senior U.S. official told CNN that relations with Ukraine appear 'irreparable' if Zelensky remains in office. Putin has long pushed for Zelensky's removal, arguing he is not a legitimate leader. This week, Putin reiterated his position in an interview, calling Zelensky 'toxic' to Ukrainian society and its military, claiming he would lose if elections were held. Putin appears to be leveraging Ukraine’s prolonged state of martial law—which has postponed elections—to deepen divisions between Kyiv’s leadership and the Ukrainian public. There is growing speculation that the U.S., possibly influenced by Russia, may now be considering moves to replace Zelensky with a more Moscow- and Trump-friendly figure. Such a leader, analysts suggest, would be more open to signing a mineral rights agreement with the U.S. and agreeing to a cease-fire—terms Zelensky has opposed without firm American security guarantees. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Despite strong European backing for Zelensky, as seen in multiple public statements of support from EU and NATO leaders, his position remains precarious. The escalating rift between Kyiv and Washington benefits Russia, which sees it as an opportunity to weaken U.S.-European unity and NATO’s cohesion. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova described Zelensky’s visit to Washington as a 'diplomatic failure,' claiming he had rejected peace efforts and was 'obsessed with continuing the war.' Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev reacted even more aggressively, mocking Zelensky’s tense White House meeting with Trump. 'A brutal slap down in the Oval Office. Trump told the cocaine clown the truth to his face for the first time: the Kiev regime is playing with World War III. And the insolent pig got a strong slap from the owners of the pigsty,' he wrote on his Telegram account. 'This is helpful. But not enough—we need to stop military aid to the Nazi machine.' Kremlin-aligned analysts expressed satisfaction with Trump’s tough stance on Zelensky, repeatedly highlighting the deepening rift between the Trump administration and the Ukrainian leader. They noted that the U.S.-Ukraine fallout is also straining Washington’s relations with European allies, further serving Moscow’s strategic interests. The future of U.S.-Ukraine relations now hinges on whether Trump and Zelensky can repair their fractured ties. If not, direct negotiations between Washington and Moscow may accelerate, potentially leading to U.S. pressure on Ukraine to accept a cease-fire on unfavorable terms. Some analysts believe Washington may also push for Zelensky’s resignation, but such a move would be seen as a major victory for Russia. Whether Zelensky would consider stepping down remains highly uncertain. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjsybpxs1l	2025-03-01T09:03:14-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/28/BJO111t1jkx/BJO111t1jkx_0_0_1879_1058_0_small.jpg

Turkey and Iran trade barbs over Syria, Israel and regional influ...	Turkish top diplomat slams Iran’s costly interventions in Syria and Iraq; Tehran fires back, accusing Ankara of ignoring US and Israeli influence while defending its role in 'supporting Palestinian resistance' and 'regional stability' Diplomatic tensions between Turkey and Iran have escalated in recent days, with officials from both countries trading accusations over regional policies, particularly regarding Syria. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan criticized Iran’s foreign policy in an interview with Al Jazeera, claiming Tehran has paid a 'very heavy price' to maintain its influence in Iraq and Syria. Fidan argued that Iran’s approach has become a burden on both its regime and the wider region, saying the cost of its interventions far outweighs any gains. Regarding Syria, Fidan called on regional powers to develop relations with Damascus 'without the foundations of control and acquisition.' However, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently met with Syria’s new president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, to discuss a security alliance that would include establishing Turkish air bases in central Syria and training the restructured Syrian military. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei responded sharply to Fidan’s remarks, accusing Turkey of 'turning a blind eye to the hidden American and Israeli hands influencing regional developments.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In a post on X, Baqaei called Fidan’s comments 'a major mistake' and agreed that the region must be freed from any country’s dominance—whether Arab, Turkish, Kurdish or Iranian. However, he questioned why Turkey omitted Israel from this equation. Baqaei accused Israel of 'reoccupying the entire Golan Heights and significant parts of Syria' following the collapse of the Assad regime, claiming Israel now 'controls the country's most vital water resources.' He further alleged that Israel had 'carried out widespread attacks on Syrian military and defense infrastructure, destroying more than 90% of it, including key research centers.' Despite its growing presence across the Middle East through proxy forces, Baqaei denied that Iran has pursued regional ambitions over the past five decades. Instead, he framed Iran’s involvement as supporting 'the Palestinian people in their struggle against occupation and aggression, while preventing Israeli dominance in the region.' 'Today, the Palestinian issue is more alive than ever, and Israel is more despised than ever,' Baqaei said. 'Iran has always supported the resistance while standing firmly against unlawful behavior and terrorism. We were the first to fight ISIS, the first to oppose the coup attempt against Turkey in 2016 and among the first to welcome the disarmament of the PKK, seeing it as a step toward Turkey’s security.' Baqaei concluded by emphasizing Iran’s consistency in its policies, contrasting it with what he suggested was Turkey’s shifting alliances. 'We stand firm in our positions and do not change our approach from one day to the next,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkhsrnxjkg	2025-03-01T08:26:08-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/24/rJr6trdS1e/rJr6trdS1e_0_100_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
We didn't come to Jerusalem to evict people from their homes'	Jewish-American developer Gary Barnett paid NIS 750M for 130 acres of Greek Orthodox Church land in Jerusalem’s Rehavia and Talbiya; in an exclusive interview, he shares his journey from a poor childhood in a family of 12 to leading a top NYC real estate firm 'We paid a lot of money for this land, and we're not going to give it away for free,' says Gary Barnett, the Jewish-American developer behind the controversial real estate deal described as the biggest in Jerusalem in the last 100 years. A year ago, Barnett completed the massive acquisition for no less than 750 million shekels, purchasing 130 acres in the heart of Jerusalem—land previously owned by the Greek Orthodox Church. However, since then, he has encountered challenges that cast doubt on the feasibility of his massive project. Barnett’s main obstacle is opposition from many of the tenants living on the land, who refuse to reach an agreement that would allow large-scale urban renewal projects, including the construction of thousands of new housing units. The vast area in Rehavia, Talbiya and Nayot neighborhoods includes some of the most central and expensive streets in the city. It currently holds around 900 housing units, well-known hotels such as the Inbal, Prima and Dan Panorama hotels, public buildings including part of the Great Synagogue and the Israel Museum, open spaces, and over 12 plots designated for development. Despite skepticism from the real estate sector regarding Barnett's ability to execute his ambitious plan, he asserts in the interview that he has no regrets about the deal, for which he spent hundreds of millions of his own money. 'I’ve been involved in many complicated and challenging deals in America,' he says. 'Extell, my company, is among the top five development firms in the U.S. We have built in Boston, Chicago, and Miami, and we have a major project in Park City, Utah. We are developing a massive ski and resort site, which is an extremely complex deal. We had to merge over 20 transactions to create the site and secure permits worth billions of dollars.' 'Something big and creative' Barnett, 69, was born on New York's Lower East Side to a father who was a rabbi and a teacher and a mother who was also an educator. He grew up in New York and in the nearby city of Monsey as one of 12 children. 'My father was born in Europe before the war and spent three years in Israel in the 1930s,' he shares. 'My mother was born in America but also spent several years in Israel in the 1930s. We were a large, poor family. I got married and moved to Belgium, where we lived for 12 years. My wife became ill and passed away after a three-year battle. 'I remarried, and when I returned to America, I was already in real estate. I managed my business from Belgium for a few years and was also involved in the diamond trade, but when I moved back to the U.S., I shifted entirely to real estate, starting with acquisitions and later moving into development.' Why did you decide to invest in Israel? 'My family and I love Israel deeply, and I have visited many times. Most of my children (Barnett has eight) studied in Israel for at least a year. Over the years, people kept asking me, ‘Why don’t you build there?’ and I never really found the right project for me. But of course, it was always a dream — to build and own something in Israel. 'When this opportunity came, it seemed big and creative enough for me to get involved. Beyond urban renewal, we also own land where important institutions like the Israel Museum and the Great Synagogue are located, and we want to help secure their long-term status. I truly believe this initiative will bring good for everyone, but it requires goodwill from all sides,' he says, referring to the Jewish National Fund (JNF), the Jerusalem Municipality, and the opposing residents. Residents claim they have become hostages in their homes. 'Naturally, people are skeptical. I understand why residents—those who live in the apartments, not investors—are initially distrustful. Many have had bad experiences with empty promises. But we have a 30-year history of successful deals and keeping our word. 'When I started my career in 1994, we had a similar situation in America. We bought a building on Manhattan’s Upper West Side during the longest rent strike in New York history—nine or 13 years. The tenants, who were politically active and savvy, had stopped paying rent because the landlord neglected the building. My partners and I saw the potential in the property, met with the tenant leader, and reached an agreement. We renovated the building, increased rents and never had any legal disputes afterward. 'One of the tenants was a rabbi with ten children. He paid $273 per month for a ten-room, 400-square-meter apartment. The court ruled we could increase his rent to $1,500, still an extremely low price for that space in Manhattan. Of course, he couldn't afford it, but we didn’t evict him. Instead, we bought him a house in Monsey, and he moved there. It was a very happy ending. Later, we renovated his old apartment and rented it for $20,000 a month. 'Bottom line, we did not come to Jerusalem to evict people from their homes. In any case, there are 25 years left on the lease, so there’s no immediate threat. We came to Israel with goodwill, and we believe our plan is a win-win for everyone.' 'There are those stirring the pot' Barnett’s acquisition was finalized in January 2023 with the seller, the Jerusalem-based Ben David family’s company, Nayot Komemiyut. The land was originally leased by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate to the Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) in the 1950s for up to 99 years (until 2052), with an option to extend. The KKL subleased the land to tenants. In 2016, Nayot Komemiyut purchased the land rights from the church, continued leasing to the KKL, and even offered tenants the chance to purchase full ownership of their homes. Some deals have been completed, including the sale of Villa Sherover, President Hotel, and other apartments. Two years ago, Barnett, along with several Jewish-American investors, acquired the land. To manage it, he established Extell Israel, which he controls. This company has no corporate affiliation with Extell Development in the U.S., one of New York’s top three real estate firms with multi-billion-dollar holdings. Barnett faces a complex real estate puzzle. The land leases expire in 25 years, raising concerns among tenants who don’t own their apartments. Barnett does not intend to renew leases, aiming instead to push forward an urban renewal plan. He offers tenants a choice: purchase ownership for a reduced price or extend their lease until 2100 without payment. However, many tenants oppose the deal, fearing high taxation costs. Some also criticize the limited 12.5-square-meter expansion he proposes for their new apartments, arguing that larger additions are approved in similar projects. The objections forced him to submit a new, improved proposal to the residents last November. Barnett’s initial proposal to the residents offered them ownership of their apartments in exchange for a payment based on different tiers: Approximately 3,000 shekels per square meter (about 300,000 shekels for a 100-square-meter apartment) for residents who owned the property before 2019. Around 5,000 shekels per square meter for those who own the apartment as a secondary property, such as foreign residents. Approximately 6,000 shekels per square meter for those renting out the apartment as an income-generating property. Around 9,000 shekels per square meter for those who purchased the property from 2019 onward. Barnett defines the latter as speculators, arguing that those who bought after 2019 acquired the properties at significantly lower prices compared to market rates. 'Less than 50% of the apartment owners actually live in them, meaning about half of the leaseholders are investors,' Barnett says. 'Some inherited the apartments and rent them out, but most are investors who, just like us, want to achieve financial success. The value of these apartments decreases every year. 'For those living in them, it might not matter much — they will stay for another 25 years, and whatever happens, happens. But what happens if they need to sell? The residents can either extend their lease or obtain full ownership. Clearly, ownership is the better option.' Extell claims that only 7% of the residents are the original leaseholders of the apartments and that 25% purchased them between 2000 and 2010 at a price 10%-20% below market value. After that, according to the company, the price was already 20%-40% below market rates. The company also asserts that about 25% of the leaseholders are not Israeli citizens. The improved offer In November, Extell improved its offer to the residents, presenting two options: Ownership of the apartments or Lease extension until the year 2100 at no cost. Additionally, the payment required for ownership was reduced. The new model is tiered: First tier: Longtime residents who have lived in the apartments since before 2019. Those opting for ownership can forgo a 12.5-square-meter expansion under the redevelopment plan and receive ownership for free. If they want the extra space, they will pay 2,000 shekels per square meter. Those who choose to extend the lease will receive the additional space at no cost, but without ownership. Second tier: Residents who do not live in the apartment and rent it out. If they choose ownership and want the 12.5-square-meter expansion, they will pay 4,000 shekels per square meter. Third tier: Residents who purchased the apartment after 2019. If they choose ownership and want the 12.5-square-meter expansion, they will pay 6,000 shekels per square meter. According to calculations by Extell, a 100-square-meter apartment in Talbiya is currently valued at approximately 2.95 million shekels under leasehold status. Transferring it to ownership would increase its value to 4.85 million shekels. After the redevelopment, the apartment would become a new 112.5-square-meter unit valued at approximately 7.87 million shekels. The company claims this deal would significantly increase the value of the apartments for residents. However, many remain opposed to the offer, partly due to concerns about high tax costs when purchasing ownership. Real estate appraiser Kobi Bir, an expert on church-owned lands, explains that church-owned lands pose challenges even for lease extension: 'On lands owned by the Israel Land Authority (ILA), lease renewal is almost automatic at a cost of 5.5% of the land’s value. However, on church-owned lands, the situation is different: renewal fees apply not only to the land but also to the buildings on it, and they are full lease fees—not the symbolic 5.5% charge. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) would have to pay the landowners a much higher amount than it can collect from residents, creating a significant financial gap and taxation issues. A lease renewal transaction is considered a real estate transaction for tax purposes. Since the renewal is based on the market value and not a symbolic lease fee, the tax on the renewal will be at full market value.' From Barnett’s perspective, if he manages to reach an agreement with all 900 residents, and they all pay at least the minimum amount instead of opting for lease extension, the total revenue from the ownership transfers alone would be around 180 million shekels, even before advancing the urban renewal project, which would include selling hundreds of new apartments at market prices. Why does the new offer include an expansion of only 12.5 square meters per apartment, rather than a larger increase, as seen in similar projects? Will there also be balconies? 'Unlike a regular urban renewal project where residents bring the land and apartments into the deal while the developer handles the redevelopment, this situation is different,' Barnett explains. 'Moreover, our offer provides a significant discount on ownership compared to market prices, granting residents a substantial financial benefit. Regarding balconies, where feasible from a planning perspective, we will certainly include them, but this depends on final approvals from the local planning and building committee.' Can residents receive an official commitment from KKL-JNF and the Israel Tax Authority that the project can proceed in order to gain their trust? 'An official commitment depends on receiving formal agreements from KKL-JNF and the Tax Authority. We are in discussions with the relevant parties and examining the possibility of obtaining such approval. 'It's important to understand that while the contracts grant KKL-JNF the right to extend the leases for additional years, the cost of extension will be determined based on market value—not just for the land but also for the buildings on it, along with undeveloped land value. This cost will be based on projected market values in 2050, when the current leases expire.' 'Not all residents have the funds to pay,' Barnett acknowledges. 'Like the rabbi in New York, we understand that. Therefore, if a resident cannot afford the payment, they will only need to pay when they sell the property or transfer it to their heirs. We never intended to pressure people who cannot afford it. We didn’t come to Jerusalem to cause trouble. Those who think our offer isn’t good enough simply don’t understand it.' He also claims: 'Some people are stirring the pot, arguing that they shouldn’t have to pay anything for ownership. But we paid about 800 million shekels for the land (750 million for the deal plus additional taxes). The Israeli government practically gave away its land for free, so some people seem to think we should do the same. We know that one of the residents’ lawyers represents a client who wants to push his own redevelopment project on these lands.' Opposition to the proposed law In July, coalition and opposition lawmakers advanced the 'Fair Leasehold' bill, which applies to church-owned and Christian monastic lands. It would grant tenants the right of first refusal to purchase their apartments and extend their leases for another 50 years at 5.5% of the land's pre-development value. If passed, this law would significantly delay Barnett’s ability to proceed with urban renewal on the lands he purchased. Real estate appraiser Bir adds that church-owned lands have become a diplomatic issue: 'Attempts to resolve the problem through legislation, such as the Fair Leasehold bill, faced strong opposition from the churches, even leading to the temporary closure of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre as a protest. The churches argue that such legislation would harm their ability to sell land in the future.' During his visit to Israel in November, Barnett did not hide his opposition to the bill, stating in the interview: 'I told the residents: if you think the Knesset will pass a law that will take our land away, it will end in 10-15 years of legal battles, and your properties will only lose value. And then, don’t expect anyone to negotiate with you.' 'Extell's position,' says Barnett, 'is that the proposed law in its current form is far from providing a fair and balanced solution. In fact, it disproportionately infringes on private property, interferes with freedom of contracts, and could potentially harm the certainty required for investors in Israel. Beyond that, as I understand it, it may also harm churches in Israel and relations with the Christian world. 'In fact,' he adds, 'a comparison between the proposed law and Extell's current proposal reveals that, in many ways, our offer is better. It grants ownership to some tenants without payment, and to others at a very low price, close to what they would be required to pay under the proposed law. It is correct and far preferable for all parties to reach agreements rather than engage in lengthy legislative processes and legal petitions, which will only prolong the existing uncertainty unnecessarily.' Does your proposal address tax aspects? 'Yes. The company is working in collaboration with expert tax advisors to minimize the exposure of lessees and the company to unnecessary taxation within the framework of the project. As explained to the lessees, the proposal is subject to obtaining relevant tax exemptions, within the framework of urban renewal and in general.' Will the tenants be able to receive ownership immediately? 'The transfer of ownership is expected to occur at the time of evacuation from the apartment, ensuring that all parties are secured. If the tenant is required to pay for the ownership, they will do so only then, and not a moment earlier.' Throughout the interview, Barnett repeatedly shifts the responsibility to the Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) and the Jerusalem Municipality, clarifying that they must assist the company in advancing the deal due to their public responsibility for the overall solution. 'In all our discussions with the KKL and the Jerusalem Municipality, we were told that we must offer the tenants a very good deal,' he says. 'We need the KKL and the municipality to support the deal, but practically, there is still no cooperation. We need to hold further discussions. It is clear that if they tell the public that they should receive more, it will ruin it for us, and they have the power to do that. But based on what they have told us in the past, it's hard for me to see them not agreeing. They still need to move from the theoretical stage to the practical stage, but we recognize that they want to resolve the issue.' Do you think the KKL will renew the lease? 'If the KKL renews, it will effectively agree irreversibly to pay hundreds of millions annually. If it passes this on to the tenants, it will be very unsuccessful for them, and if not, it involves providing subsidies of hundreds of millions annually to tenants, instead of using these funds for other purposes that the KKL promotes. 'In light of the attractive offer on the table, where the tenants will receive ownership, not a lease, without any payment from the KKL, it's hard for me to imagine the KKL passing on a win-win opportunity. We have now seen a very good response from many more tenants saying, 'Okay, this is what we've been waiting for,'' claims Barnett. 'Resolving the issue' Alongside the many objections from tenants who have not yet agreed to the deal, there are those who would like to move forward with Extell. 'I have an investment apartment in the best place in Jerusalem, and I know that when we get older, I want to live in the Talbiya neighborhood with my wife,' says an investor from the central region, who asked to remain anonymous. 'We purchased the apartment in August 2023, just before the war, and we understood that we were entering into lease agreements until 2052. I told myself that this must be resolved because what will happen in 25 years? Will people be evicted from their homes? Just when we saw that Extell had purchased the lands, I understood their financial strength and capabilities. 'I saw their projects in New York, and I told myself that if such a body comes to a place like Jerusalem, it will probably do serious work there. I assumed they didn't pay 750 million shekels for lands to wait until 2052 to do something with them. 'We bought with the understanding that the new landowners would upgrade the entire complex. You don't need to be a real estate person to see the buildings around and understand the potential of new structures. From meetings we held with Extell and with Gary himself, we were impressed that there is an intention to promote respectable projects. 'I understand the opponents, who are afraid and don't want to be suckers, but I say: I hold a property under lease for another 25 years. If someone offers me a reasonable offer with a reasonable addition to get ownership and a better apartment - I'm happy. 'I know that it's possible to get an addition of more than 12.5 square meters; there are contractors here who offer tenants an addition of 25 square meters per apartment, and I agree that one shouldn't agree to a deal hastily, but they forget that the situation here is not normal; the apartment is not ours, and they are offering us ownership of it.' In the residents' protest headquarters, they are less happy. The headquarters stated: 'Gary Barnett and his group continue to intimidate the tenants, threatening that they will be evicted from their homes if they do not agree to Barnett's draconian and unilateral terms, while applying heavy pressure on elderly people and foreign residents through mailboxes, email, and phone continuously. The state and the KKL must end this saga and the loss of control over vast areas in the heart of Jerusalem by quickly completing the legislation and exercising the KKL's right to extend the lease without the need to dip into the public pocket. This is also the simple solution for the KKL, due to complex contractual obligations, including full compensation and lease periods crossing the year 2052 for some lessees. 'Extell is trying to divide and conquer between lessees, to create conflicts between buildings and complexes, and to ride on the tenants' rights on the way to obtaining the coveted approvals from the KKL, the Jerusalem Municipality, and the Knesset, approvals that it is light-years away from receiving. 'The Fair Lease Law currently being promoted was passed in a similar version in the British Parliament and other countries and was approved by the European Court of Human Rights as proportionate and just. The law is supposed to regulate the issue, including tax issues, in a way that preserves the tenants' rights and does not allow any land speculator to do with them as they please. 'This whole situation was born in sin, without the tenants' knowledge and behind their backs. Signing with Barnett and Extell is a clear own goal and a very problematic tax event, and therefore the vast majority of tenants do not succumb to his intimidation campaign about long legal proceedings and eviction.' The Jerusalem Municipality stated: 'The mayor is monitoring developments on this issue with concern. Although this is not a municipal matter, it is of great importance to a large segment of the city's public. The mayor has clarified that the issue should be resolved at the national level, through legislation or other arrangements, provided that this does not come at the expense of the leaseholders. |'He has informed the developer and the leaseholders that the Jerusalem Municipality will not permit the advancement of plans within its jurisdiction on church lands until the matter is settled. When such a settlement is on the table, the municipality will take the necessary steps to assist. Ultimately, these are leaseholders who have acted honestly and in good faith and deserve protection and assistance.' KKL-JNF declined to specify their position regarding the deal and only stated: 'KKL-JNF was not and is not a party to the transaction for the sale of rights to the Jerusalem Lands Company (Extell Israel), nor did it receive any notification of the intention to carry it out. 'However, recently there has been dialogue between company representatives and KKL-JNF professionals. In this context, KKL-JNF clarified its position regarding its rights, including its right to extend the lease period. Additionally, although KKL-JNF is not the entity representing the sub-lessees and residents, it places great importance on protecting their rights and acts accordingly.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sj2xiu2q1l	2025-03-01T07:56:18-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/yk14237976/yk14237976_0_50_919_518_0_small.jpg

A quiet leader': How one courageous IDF officer saved 17 soldier...	CPT Eden Nimri heroically fought terrorists during Nahal Oz base massacre, saving 17 soldiers before being killed; her family, presented with her team’s charred logbook, treasures records of her professionalism, warnings to commanders and her ultimate sacrifice On October 4, 2023, Team Nimri, led by Captain Eden Nimri, arrived at the Nahal Oz base from the northern sector to replace the 'Sky Rider' unit, which had gone home for the holiday. Three days later, Eden was killed in a heroic battle against terrorists who infiltrated the base during the October 7 massacre. Team Nimri always carried an operations logbook, meticulously documenting every activity. The logbook, which was in the command room that was completely burned during the massacre, miraculously survived and was recently presented to Eden’s family. Inside, they found details about her final days and her professional conduct leading up to the attack. Originally, Eden was set to become an exceptional athlete due to her swimming talent, but as her enlistment approached, she decided to pursue meaningful military service. After dropping out of the pilot training course, she was assigned to the 'Sky Rider' unit, part of the Artillery Corps. Soldiers in this unit work alongside ground forces, operating a small UAV called the 'Skylark,' used for intelligence gathering, directing forces, artillery fire and other purposes. Eden underwent a year of training and served as a combat soldier at the Nahal Oz base. 'A brilliant girl with incredible abilities,' her mother, Sharon, proudly recalls. Eden eventually became an officer and served in the northern sector. Occasionally, she and her team were sent to replace soldiers in the southern sector, as they were during the Yom Kippur holiday in 2023. They arrived at the Nahal Oz base, a place Eden knew well from her previous service. 'The base looked abandoned, neglected and desolate,' Sharon recounts from a family visit to Eden. 'Eden told us about the barrier erected against tunnels, the mounds of dirt and the fence. She felt safe and protected. They were sold stories that put them at ease. But Eden, who had fought in Operation Guardian of the Walls, knew the enemy all too well.' A year earlier, Eden had arrived at the Nahal Oz base with four female soldiers under her command. During their time in the sector, they were not required to carry out any operations. 'Eden was told there was no operational necessity,' Sharon explains. 'She was concerned that her soldiers' readiness was deteriorating. She warned her commanders every day, raising the problematic situation to everyone who needed to know, but no one listened. They dismissed her concerns.' On October 7, just days after arriving at the base, Eden heroically fought off terrorists, enabling the female soldiers to escape from the fortified shelter, where she was ultimately killed. She saved the lives of 17 soldiers, including lookout soldiers who were kidnapped and later released. 'They woke up to the sounds of gunfire, and Eden immediately grabbed her weapon and led the girls to a shelter where soldiers she didn’t even know were hiding, as gunfire and explosions rang out,' Sharon recounts. 'At 7:15 a.m, she managed to message us that everything was okay. Six minutes later, she informed her company, Team Nimri has taken command of the shelter.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Eden heard the terrorists approaching and didn’t flinch. She kept firing to draw their attention and allow the girls to escape, even as the terrorists started throwing grenades into the shelter. The last person to see Eden said she was crouched with her weapon, continuing to return fire. She was a fighter and a commander until the very end—that’s who she was. Even in pajamas, without her officer insignia, she was fully committed to her role and tried to save as many lives as she could, even though everyone there had effectively been sentenced to death.' Just two days later, Eden was supposed to begin a new role at Mitzpe Ramon, serving as the acting Operations Officer for her unit. 'We had already planned her farewell from the team and the base, and we wanted to accompany her transition to her new post,' Sharon says. 'A beautiful girl, full of light, who loved life and was loved in return, until that tragic Saturday. She did everything with courage and humility. Her commanders describe her as a quiet leader.' The release of the lookout soldiers deeply moved Eden’s family. 'We hoped for this moment. They were there and witnessed Eden in her final moments. We are eager to meet them, to hear about that day through their eyes. They even spoke about her in the Hamas tunnels to other captives who were later released. They didn’t even know her name, but it was important to them to share her act of heroism.' Ahead of Tu Bishvat, a senior military officer visited the family. After presenting them with a tree to plant and dried fruits, he revealed for the first time the operations logbook of Team Nimri. 'I was very surprised to see the logbook, which was completely charred but whose contents were preserved,' Sharon recalls. The family was even more astonished to discover that the last entry in the logbook was dated October 3. 'The logbook is full of daily reports from Eden and her team. In the northern sector, they operated around the clock, 24/7. Everything was documented and written. But the entries stop on October 3. From the moment the team arrived at Nahal Oz, nothing was written, meaning there was no activity.' The family has requested to keep the logbook, which survived the devastation of the command room, as a final memento. 'Through the logbook, you can see Eden,' Sharon concludes. 'Her pursuit of excellence, her professionalism and her attention to detail. She understood the responsibility placed on her and the significance of her role. It proves to me what I already know—how meaningful she was in her life.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/h1clgnjcjg	2025-03-01T07:21:52-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/HyFYGnVM9yg/HyFYGnVM9yg_16_77_1214_684_0_small.jpg
Hamas releases video of freed hostage Iair Horn and his brother E...	Terror group releases clip showing brothers alongside other hostages in what appears to be their final moments together before Iair’s release Hamas released a video Saturday showing freed Israeli hostage Iair Horn alongside his brother Eitan, who remains in captivity, in what appears to be their final moments together before Iair’s release. The footage also shows another former hostage, agui Dekel-Chen, who was freed along with Iair. At the request of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the video or any part of it will only be published with the family's approval. Iair Horn, who was held by Hamas for 489 days, spoke publicly for the first time on Wednesday at Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, just hours after the funeral of the Bibas family, whose bodies were returned from Gaza last week. 'I was kidnapped on October 7, and after 498 days, I was released from Hamas captivity,' he said. 'I want to thank all those advocating and working to bring the hostages home. Your efforts matter—the fact that I am standing here today proves that.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Horn, visibly emotional, emphasized that his freedom remains incomplete as long as others are still in captivity. 'I am standing here, but 63 hostages are not—among them my younger brother, Eitan Horn. Until he and the others return, I will not truly be here. Maybe my body, but not my soul,' he said. Fighting back tears, Horn described his time in captivity and the stark contrast to life outside. 'This is the first time in 498 days that I have stood under the sun for this long. I didn’t have the privilege of breathing fresh air. While we are here, enjoying the sun—or taking it for granted—there are hostages still struggling to breathe.' He urged immediate action for a second phase of the hostage deal. 'There is no time. A second phase must be signed to bring them all back now. I stand before you knowing exactly what they are going through. The hostages don’t have time—we must bring them home now. Help me bring back my little brother, Eitan.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj7waoejyx	2025-03-01T06:58:04-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/01/H18N4ieoye/H18N4ieoye_0_0_1920_1080_0_small.jpg

Military intelligence probe reveals Hamas plans to assassinate 60...	Results of the investigation by the intelligence force show Hamas planned its massacre for 2022 and then during Passover of 2023 and did not consider Israel's internal strife over judicial legislation in determining when to strike After the IDF completed its investigations into failings of the military leading to and during the Hamas massacre of October 7, new information was revealed including Hamas's plan to kill 600 people in the Negev desert town of Ofakim. Raad Saad, the first of the Hamas operations commander that Israel attempted to assassinate during the war, was the one who devised the plan to infiltrate Israel above ground, avoiding the use of tunnels after an underground barrier was built by Israel. Based on his plans, Battalions of the elite Nukhba forces were established, including a reserve force for each. Intelligence gathered in Gaza during the offensive last year, revealed a trove of intelligence. The plan that was first devised in 2017, included live streaming of the incursions into border communities and IDF positions, subterfuge and control of strategic and symbolic locations such as police stations and the intention to reach cities in the South including Beer Sheva, Ashdod and Ashkelon. The plan for Ofakim called for the murder of at least 600 civilians. During the massacre, 33 of the city's residents were murdered. The planned attack during scrapped when IDF chief stayed overnight at the border Review of the intelligence showed that the anti-government protests that broke out over the attempted legislation to weaken Israel's judicial branch, were not a consideration of Hamas, when it decided on the timing of the massacre. Israeli intelligence missed two earlier dates when Hamas planned to launch the attack, one during the previous government and the other during the Passover holiday in 2023. Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi attended a Seder meal with troops at the time and stayed at the base overnight. The intelligence analysts believe Hamas postponed their planned massacre both times in the last moment choosing to improve their forces capabilities. 'Hamas understood that they are only 85% prepared at the end of 2022 and during part of 2023. We found in one of the operatives files a record of the original date for attack,' the military intelligence probe said. 'We discovered that 2022 was considered a year of great opportunities.' The military intelligence research department that was supposed to issue strategic alerts of war, missed at least 10 signs in the two years preceding the war. In one case they misinterpreted a Hamas produced television series that included scenes that were later played out in the massacre. Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was later killed in an Israeli strike, praised the program that showed how the terror group intended to infiltrate into Israel. Israel's worse case scenario unlike the reality Israel prepared a worse case scenario that included an invasion of some 70 terrorists from four to eight locations and activated its plan of response just nine minutes after the massacre began. But in reality the first wave of the attack included 1,175 terrorists while the IDF had 671 soldiers only to respond. The military's command bunger that was activated soon after the start of the Hamas assault only knew about 55% of the events occurring on the ground which prevented an accurate picture of events and confusion while the Gaza division collapsed. Where was the Air Force According to the military probe, the first drone attack was at 7:15 am and prevented terrorists from entering Netiv Haasara. At 7:55 am the first fighter jet strike targeted a tunnel near the border moshav to stop terrorists from infiltrating underground. At 8:02 am a helicopter gunship first fired at terrorists near Kibbutz Re'im and at 8:10 wounded were evacuated by chopper. At 8:47 am, special forces were flown in to join the fighting along the border and in the communities. The Hamas massacre began after a day of preparations that started around mid-day on Friday, without being detected by the IDF or the Shin Bet. The terrorists came in three waves with 5,500 armed men who proceeded to carry their planned murder, rape and abductions.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy542kxoke	2025-03-01T04:51:37-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/HJeY7F9n5ke/HJeY7F9n5ke_0_678_851_479_0_small.jpg

Israel advocating for Russian presence in Syria to counter growin...	Israeli officials urge the United States to allow Russians to keep military presence after demanding demilitarized zone south of Damascus preventing Islamist regime forces from taking positions on the Israeli border Israel wants Russian forces to remain in Syria in the wake of the fall of the Assad regime and after it announced its demand for a demilitarized zone south of the capital Damascus. Israeli officials have been pressuring the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to ensure that Syria is weakened by allowing the Russians to hold on to their bases there in order to curb Turkish influence over the new Syrian rulers, according to Reuters, citing four sources. Prime MInister Benjamin Netanyahu's statement that that IDF troops would remain on the ground in Syria, sparked protests and drew condemnation from Damascus calling for an immediate pullback of Israeli forces from Syrian land. On Saturday, the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group declared an immediate ceasefire heeding jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan's call on the PKK to lay down its arms and dissolve and a move that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's government and the opposition pro-Kurdish DEM party voiced support for. Ending the insurgency would facilitate efforts by Syria's new regime to assert greater sway over areas in northern Syria controlled by Kurdish forces. Since Assad's fall, Turkey has repeatedly demanded that the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the YPG militia disarm, warning of military action otherwise. However, the SDF said that while Ocalan's call was positive, it did not apply to them. Israel communicated its views to top U.S. officials during meetings in Washington in February and subsequent meetings in Israel with U.S. Congressional representatives, three U.S. sources and another person familiar with the contacts said. The main points were also circulated to some senior U.S. officials in an Israeli 'white paper', two of the sources said. 'Israel's big fear is that Turkey comes in and protects this new Syrian Islamist order, which then ends up being a base for Hamas and other militants,' said Aron Lund, a fellow at U.S.-based think-tank Century International.

Free world 'seeking new leader,' after Trump turns back on Ukrain...	Without mentioning the U.S. president by name most Western leaders say they stand by Ukraine against Russian aggression; division of the West makes us all weaker and favors those who would like to see the decline of our civilization, Italy's Meloni says Most European leaders came out in support of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after the unprecedented confrontation with U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday that included accusations, reprimands and the rolling of eyes, and all in plain sight of the entire world, and his reported subsequent removal from the White House. Vice-President of the European Commission Kaja Kallas said clearly that the free world needs a new leader. Zelensky left without signing a deal to allow the U.S. access to his countries untapped minerals including future earnings. In an interview with Fox he later said the administration could be more on Ukraine's side. 'You’re either going to make a deal, or we’re out,' Trump angrily told Zelensky in the Oval Office. 'And if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. I don’t think it’s gonna be pretty, but you’ll fight it out. You don’t have the cards. Once we sign that deal, you’re in a much better position, but you’re not acting at all thankful, and that’s not a nice thing. I’ll be honest, that’s not a nice thing,' the American president said. 'It is very important for us that Ukraine is heard and that no one forgets about it, neither during the war nor after. It is important for people in Ukraine to know that they are not alone, that their interests are represented in every country, in every corner of the world,' the Ukrainian president said on a post on Saturday. Without specifically calling Trump out by name, Europe's leaders were quick to express their support for Ukraine and its leaders. 'No one wants peace more than the citizens of Ukraine! That is why we are jointly seeking the path to a lasting and just peace. Ukraine can rely on Germany, and on Europe,' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. French president Macron agreed. 'Russia is the aggressor, and Ukraine is the aggressed people. I think we were all right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago, and to continue to do so, we, that is the United States of America, the Europeans, the Canadians, the Japanese and many others,' he said. 'We must thank all those who have helped and respect those who have been fighting since the beginning.

Israel violating cease-fire, Lebanese president says	In his first interview Joseph Aoun says speaking to cease-fire mediators to remove IDF troops from five South Lebanon locations; says decisions on war and peace must be in the hands of the state but hopes to resolve conflicts diplomatically Lebanese President Joseph Aoun said Israel was violating the terms of the cease-fire by maintaining its troop presence in five locations near the Israel-Lebanon border. In his first interview since taking office, Aoun told the Saudi-owned, UK-based Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper that he did not believe there was a military need for Israel to remain on Lebanese soil. 'With drones and satellites, these locations are meaningless,' he said. Aoun said he was in contact with French and American mediators to pressure Israel to withdraw its forces. 'If the American administration, until now, did not pressure Israel to leave Lebanese territory, it means either that there is no desire to do so or that it is waiting for the appropriate time, I don't know,' he said but added that relations with the United States were necessary because of their position in the world. Aoun was named president after the war between Israel and Hezbollah ended and after Hezbollah's leaders, including Hassan Nasrallah were assassinated. said that his country was tired of war. 'In all honesty Lebanon is tired. The Lebanese are tired of others fighting their wars on our land. We deserve economic and political recovery,' he said.

Lebanon was committed to UN resolution 1701, Aoun said. adding he hoped to end military confrontations and resolve them diplomatically. 'We as military men, however, always think of the worse. The worse is a military conflict and that depends on the decision of the state.' Aoun said he hopes to ensure relations based on mutual respect with all countries, including Iran.

Hamas rejects Israel's 'formulation' of extending first Gaza ceas...	Terror group says it would not release more hostages until negotiations for the second phase of the deal proceed including an end to the war and a withdrawal of IDF troops from Gaza Hamas said on Saturday that it rejected Israel's 'formulation' of extending the first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza, on the day the first stage of the deal was set to expire. The group's spokesperson Hazem Qassem also told Al-Araby TV there were no current talks for a second ceasefire phase in Gaza with the group. He said Israel wanted to release more hostages along with the possibility to renew attacks on the Gaza Strip and was avoiding its commitment to end the war and withdraw its forces. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu summoned senior ministers and security officials to consultations late on Friday after Hamas refused to discuss an extension to the first phase of the cease-fire deal and insisted that talks begin on the second phase that includes and end to the war. The consultations were held after the delegation sent to Cairo for negotiations returned without any progress made. Egyptian sources told Reuters that Israel was attempting to extend the first phase by 42 days, so that three hostages would be released each week in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. An Israeli official confirmed that that was Israel's intention. This is the first Saturday that no hostages are being released. There are currently 59 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Israel believes 22 of them are alive.

Oron Shaul rescue: The covert operation that almost collapsed the...	Just two days before the first phase of the cease-fire deal in Gaza, intelligence reveals Shaul held above ground, near civilians requiring a tough choice: launch a mission or risk the hostage deal Israel’s Shin Bet and IDF faced a nerve-wracking dilemma in January after receiving precise intelligence on the location of the body of Staff Sgt. Oron Shaul, a Golani Brigade soldier killed in the 2014 Gaza war. Since then, Hamas had held his remains. On one hand, this was a rare opportunity to bring him home for burial, offering some solace to his grieving family. On the other, a ceasefire was set to begin in two days, along with the release of the first three hostages. A failed recovery operation could jeopardize international mediation efforts, reignite fighting, and endanger other captives. What should they do? In a joint decision, the Shin Bet and Southern Command authorized the mission in two phases. The first, within the limits of what can be publicly disclosed, aimed to establish optimal conditions for the extraction deep inside Gaza. Special forces along with infantry troops and the Armored Corps participated. Secrecy was so tight that many support units were unaware of the target’s identity. The second phase—the actual recovery—took place more than 24 hours later, in the overnight hours between Saturday and Sunday, just before the ceasefire took effect. The rescue team was comprised Shin Bet operatives and Shayetet 13 commandos. Shaul’s body was not buried but kept above ground, near civilian areas, adding to the risks. Hours before reaching the site, an IDF tank providing security detected a suspected terrorist. Tracking him led to the discovery of three additional Hamas operatives near the location of Shaul’s remains. Again, a dilemma emerged: attacking could alert Hamas and bring reinforcements, while ignoring the threat could endanger the rescuers. After much deliberation, the Air Force was called in, eliminating all four militants. The IDF held its breath, hoping the strike wouldn’t compromise the mission. Maj. (res.) D., an operations officer in the 188th Brigade and one of the planners, monitored the mission from the command center. Yet, even he didn’t know the identity of the target until the operation began. 'The intelligence came in during combat. I assume the urgency of the ceasefire led to mistakes that provided this intelligence,' he told Ynet. 'The most tense moments were before reaching the body. Early on, we didn’t know if there would be terrorists in the building. We didn’t even know for sure if the body was there or what condition it would be in. We didn’t know what tools or how many people would be needed to retrieve it. It was an ongoing uncertainty until the full picture became clear, from the moment of recovery to securing the evacuation point. In our command center, there was total silence—everyone’s eyes were on the screen.' By Sunday morning, a sigh of relief echoed from Southern Command to IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv. Shaul’s body had been recovered, the mission was executed without casualties, and after arrival in Israel and a positive identification, his family was finally notified—10.5 years after his capture. Defense officials said that Hamas was unaware of the operation, which went smoothly. 'We knew we had done something significant—we brought him home,' D. said. 'This mission was a peak moment for all of us, after everything we had been through.' S., a Shin Bet official involved in the operation said that since the war began, a massive amount of intelligence was received and prossessed and detainees interrogated. 'A key part of our job was simply organizing all that information—piecing together a complex puzzle. For this moment, all the effort was worth it.' Learning About Your Brother From WhatsApp Oron Shaul, 21, from Poria, was killed between July 19 and 20, 2014, about two weeks into Operation Protective Edge in Gaza. He was part of a Golani force inside an armored personnel carrier (APC) that was struck by Hamas anti-tank fire in Shuja'iyya. The bodies of six of his comrades were recovered and declared dead two days later. Although Hamas claimed Shaul was captured, he was initially classified as missing in action. Only on July 25 did the IDF officially determine, based on battlefield evidence, that he had been killed, designating him a fallen soldier whose burial place was unknown. Before that, Shaul’s family first learned about the incident through a WhatsApp message. the war in 2014 was Israel’s first major military campaign in the smartphone era, where instant messaging apps spread real-time information—often tragically accurate—at an uncontrollable pace. This was the case when a message titled 'APC Incident with Casualties' reached Oron’s brother, Aviram Shaul. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: For a decade, the Shaul family fought to bring him home. At one point, his mother Zehava and brothers Aviram and Ofek petitioned the Supreme Court, alleging that the IDF was withholding information and demanding access to documents related to Oron’s fate. Their request was denied. His father, Herzl Shaul, passed away in 2016 without witnessing the mission’s conclusion. The formal reclassification of Oron Shaul as a 'captured fallen soldier' only came after the October 7 Hamas attack. 'The IDF finally admitted how absurd it was to say ‘burial place unknown,’' Aviram told Ynet. 'For years, we fought to change that designation. We even went to the Supreme Court and lost. To me, it was hypocrisy. The only thing that changed was that now there were more fallen soldiers held by Hamas. But Oron had clearly been taken—his vest and helmet were found in a tunnel in Gaza. There was no escaping the truth. The IDF’s refusal to acknowledge it was inexplicable.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hylbs4li1x	2025-02-28T23:12:04-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/11/21/9610964/9610964_0_0_980_981_0_small.jpg
A heartfelt journal of a severely wounded Golani officer	After sustaining life threatening injuries in his lungs, face and hands, a Golani officer document road to recovery in journal; says his daughters were constantly on his mind: 'I told myself, ‘Survive for them'' 'After more than ten minutes in the air, Vitaly leaned close to my ear and whispered that we were on our way to Tel Aviv, to Sourasky Medical Center. Inside, I felt the first hint of relief. My mind and emotions were deeply consumed by the event, but that whisper—Tel Aviv, Sourasky—was profoundly powerful to me. It represented a sharp transition from the harsh realities of the battlefield to the place where my greatest joy came into the world: Sourasky, the hospital where my children were born.' There’s something magnetic about B., in the way he writes and speaks. It’s as though he carries an internal fire for action and creation—one that, not so long ago, also resonated through the strings of his beloved guitar. Today, due to his injury, he can no longer play the guitar but instead plays the piano (with remarkable skill) at Sourasky Medical Center in Tel Aviv. As part of his rehabilitation, B. decided to document his journey in what he calls his 'injury journal.' He explains that it’s not a form of emotional therapy but rather a personal document he plans to one day pass on to his children when they ask, 'What did Dad do in the war?' B., who was severely injured in Lebanon, sees writing his journal as a tribute to his family. 'My words are heartfelt, and this journal is my way of honoring my wife and children.' When it came time to sit down and share his story, B. hesitated. A 35-year-old Tel Aviv resident and finance manager at a high-tech company, B. wasn’t sure he wanted to talk about the heroic events in which he saved himself and another soldier from a burning shelter that was hit by a drone on October 8, near a northern border outpost. 'During that moment, I stared death in the face, and it gave me a minute to think about everything. A thousand thoughts raced through my mind, but one of them was that I hadn’t left any message for my family. No words for my children to explain why Dad had been gone for so long on reserve duty, in case I didn’t make it. My family gave me the drive to survive, and now this is my way of giving back to them—by telling the story. Beyond that, it helps me in my recovery. Writing feels like a form of meditation.' Like so many reservists in their thirties, the war upended B.’s life without warning. Since the fighting began, he has spent dozens of days on the northern border across three rounds of reserve duty. On October 7, the Hamas attack found him with his family at his parents’ home in Ma’ale Adumim. 'It was my wife who woke me up and showed me that infamous image of the pickup truck in Sderot. At first, I didn’t know if it was real, but then the air raid siren went off. I ran to the synagogue to bring the kids, who were with my parents, and when I got back, the phone rang. As a sergeant in the 769th Battalion, I knew I was being called up. I quickly packed my things and drove to the meeting point.' B. completed two full rounds in the tense north, just before the situation escalated. He received his third reserve duty call-up while on a family vacation in Thailand—a trip he had organized to briefly escape the situation. 'I knew it might happen. We had been prepared for it, and when the call came, I didn’t tell my wife immediately. I waited until we were on the plane to drop that ‘bombshell.’ It wasn’t an easy conversation. We were on our way back from Thailand, and I had to tell the mother of my two children that I was returning to the hell of real war.' In his journal, B. describes the moment like this: 'I felt a strange mix of excitement and dread about entering Lebanon.' B. arrived at the northern base immediately after Rosh Hashanah. Three days later, he sustained a severe injury. 'I suppose it was the quickest way to get back to Tel Aviv,' he jokes, his dark humor surfacing as he recalls the incident. 'I didn’t plan for this to happen. In fact, I was thrilled at the prospect of entering Lebanon. There was this internal excitement mixed with pride. Even when I was in Thailand and heard about what the country had done to Hezbollah, I felt proud—proud of our ability to return to high levels of cunning and strategy. I wanted to be there, to be part of it.' On the morning of October 8, 2024, exactly one year and one day after the war began, B. was severely wounded at a base near the Lebanese border. 'It was the quietest morning we’d had. I woke up at five to help secure some forces. By seven, I looked at the sky and thought to myself how wonderful it was to hear that silence. I was in the operations room when it all began. Out of nowhere, drones started falling on the base. I ran to the shelter to prepare equipment with another soldier, and suddenly, a drone hit one of the base’s structures near the shelter, causing a massive explosion.' The blast trapped B. and the other soldier inside the shelter, which caught fire. 'Flames and smoke created a wall, and we knew no one could come in to rescue us. The heat was unbearable, and we couldn’t even see the short distance to the door. Outside, I could hear shouting and bullets whizzing by. Later, I learned the fire had ignited the ammunition. Inside, all I knew was that we were in a major event.' Seconds into the incident, B. realized the severity of the situation. 'It was clear no one could get to us, and that this would be a painful and fiery end. We couldn’t even exchange words—the rising heat drove us to silence. At one point, I hugged my friend and told him I loved him. I hoped I’d pass out, but I couldn’t. Suddenly, my child’s face appeared in my mind. I couldn’t believe this was how it was going to end.' Through the thick black smoke, B. spotted a ray of sunlight piercing through. Together with his friend, he decided to run through the fire to save themselves. 'We just looked at each other and said, ‘Let’s run.’' B. was the first to make contact with the flames during what became the run of his life—a mere seven meters. 'We had to move obstacles out of the way, which caused burns on our hands, but I didn’t care. We made it out and reached another shelter, where I collapsed on the floor. At that moment, I realized I was in serious trouble; I couldn’t breathe. The pain in my body was excruciating, and from that point on, I could only take shallow sips of air until I was evacuated. It was terrifying. Later, I learned I had sustained lung injuries from the blast and inhaled toxic gases.'

Don’t make things harder for the others handling the situation.’ I felt surrounded by the country’s bravest lions, and this is a good time to thank them. It’s always reassuring to know you’re in the company of lions.' When B. arrived at the hospital, he could barely whisper due to his injuries. Yet when asked to inform his partner of his condition, he hesitated. 'I thought it was too much for me to handle. I sat there for ten minutes because I couldn’t remember her number. In the end, I managed. I didn’t know what to say, but when she heard my voice, she started crying. Then I passed the phone to the casualty officer.' Weeks later, B. decided to take on the task of writing his injury journal. It serves as both a record of what he endured over the past year and a half and as part of his occupational therapy to rehabilitate his hands, which suffered severe burns. 'I write at least three or four times a week. At first, because of the pain, I could only write for a few minutes at a time. I’d write, then rest, and then write again. Over time, I’ve been able to extend those periods. Now, I can sometimes write for half an hour or even an hour.' So far, B. has documented everything leading up to his injury. He plans to continue writing about his hospitalization—when he wasn’t sure he’d survive—and his rehabilitation. He approaches the process with minimal self-censorship and takes pride in his progress. 'My words are heartfelt and unfiltered. There are things I don’t want to remember, so they don’t make it in. My focus is on my children and what I want them to read someday. I want them to know what we endured as a family during this war—what all reservist families endured, whether injured or not. Writing helps me with my hands, and I’ve even started drawing to improve my dexterity. I’ve returned to playing the piano. Above all, I want to return to reserve duty. It has to be something that suits my limitations, but I want to keep contributing. I was an integral part of Israel’s security, and I want to continue being one.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hjh55u39ye	2025-02-28T22:34:46-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/ry04tQsYJg/ry04tQsYJg_1_75_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Illinois jury convicts man in hate crime murder of Palestinian Am...	Joseph Czuba, 73, faces life in prison when he is sentenced in May for a murder that prosecutors said was sparked by anti-Muslim hatred An Illinois jury on Friday found a man guilty of murder and hate crime charges for an October 2023 stabbing that killed a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy and severely wounded his mother, according to court documents. Joseph Czuba, 73, faces life in prison when he is sentenced in May for a murder that prosecutors said was sparked by anti-Muslim hatred. It took place just days after Hamas militants carried out an October 7, 2023 attack inside Israel. The murder of the boy, Wadee Alfayoumi, and the attack on his mother, Hanan Shaheen, was one of the earliest and worst hate crime incidents in the U.S. since the start of the Israel-Gaza war. Czuba, who was the landlord for Shaheen and her son, stabbed the boy 26 times with a military-style knife with a 7-inch (18-cm) serrated blade, authorities said. Shaheen suffered multiple stab wounds in the attack that occurred in Plainfield Township, about 40 miles (64 km) southwest of Chicago. During the trial this week, Shaheen testified that Czuba told her 'you, as a Muslim, must die'. Michael Fitzgerald, prosecutor at Will County State's Attorney's Office, presented a 911 call's recording in the trial. 'The landlord is killing me and my baby,' Shaheen is heard saying on the audio. Czuba had earlier pleaded not guilty and did not testify during the trial that started on Tuesday. Other U.S. incidents raising alarm over anti-Arab bias include the attempted drowning of a 3-year-old Palestinian American girl in Texas, the stabbing of a Palestinian American man in Texas, the beating of a Muslim man in New York, a violent mob attack on pro-Palestinian protesters in California and a Florida shooting of two Israeli visitors whom a suspect mistook to be Palestinians.

The outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militia will heed its jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan's call for disarmament and declare an immediate ceasefire, a news agency close to the group cited it as saying on Saturday, in a major step toward ending a 40-year conflict with the Turkish state. The group said it hoped Ankara would release Ocalan, held in near total isolation since 1999, so he can lead a process of disarmament, adding that the necessary political and democratic conditions need to be established for the process to succeed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryishmesjg	2025-02-28T21:01:39-08:00

Cairo talks focus on extending ceasefire amid fragile hostage neg...	Israel attempts to secure additional hostage releases before Saturday, but chances appear slim as discussions with Hamas on extending the deal terms have only just begun Negotiations regarding the continuation of the hostage deal have been ongoing in Cairo since Thursday. According to Egyptian sources who spoke to Reuters, Israel is attempting to extend the first phase by 42 days, meaning Hamas would release three hostages each week in exchange for prisoners released from Israeli jails. Sources in Cairo added Hamas does not agree to this and wishes to proceed to Phase B as originally agreed, which would bring the war to an end. An Israeli source confirmed only that 'the goal is indeed to extend Phase A.' Israel’s aim was to secure the release of additional hostages by Saturday, but sources familiar with the details say the chances of achieving results in the near term are 'low,' as negotiations on the terms for the continuation have just begun. If there is no additional release on Saturday, it will mark the first weekend during Donald Trump’s presidency in which no hostages have been released—after 42 days and despite his strong threats against Hamas. Over the course of the deal, 33 hostages have been released in nine stages, 25 alive and eight deceased. Hamas—and Arab media outlets—are accusing Israel of being unwilling to proceed to Phase B. Today, the organization officially announced the completion of the final stage of the deal and stated that they have fulfilled all of their obligations under it. In a statement identical to one released on Thursday, Hamas called on the international community to 'apply pressure' on Israel to move forward with Phase B 'without any delay or evasion.' On Thursday, Hamas spokesperson Abd al-Latif al-Qanou stated that the terror organization is 'ready to extend Phase A or merge the two phases, but only in accordance with our red lines.' This morning, sources in the organization told the Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper that whether Phase A is extended or Phase B begins, they will demand that Israel release 'more prisoners' in exchange for the remaining hostages in Gaza. According to the sources, who referred to the remaining hostages as 'military' even though not all are soldiers, 'the criteria will be 'different' from what was agreed upon in the past, as the price must be proportional.' This suggests that the terror organization may demand the release of 150 prisoners or more for each hostage. Meanwhile, Israel has announced that it will not withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor, receiving backing from Trump, who stated that he would accept any decision by Israel since Hamas has not responded to the ultimatum to return all hostages at once. If hostages are not released soon, it is expected that fighting will resume, with Defense Minister Israel Katz warning that Hamas is 'planning attacks on soldiers and communities.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: As efforts to extend the ceasefire continue in Cairo, media outlets in Gaza reported on Friday that IDF carried out a drone strike in central Rafah, killing one Palestinian. At the same time, relatives of freed hostage Liri Albag held a celebration in her honor. During the event—before raising a toast—she said: 'There are still 59 hostages that I want to bring back; they are my family. I want to say that although I’ve returned home, I won’t feel complete until everyone is back.' Shir Siegel speaks in Shokeda Forest Shir, daughter of freed hostage Keith Siegel, visited the Gaza border area on Friday for the first time since October 7. 'If you had asked me a year and a half ago if there was a chance I would stand here and speak about hostages—I would have laughed,' Shir said at an event supporting local businesses, marking Family Day in Shokeda Forest. 'No one believed such a day would come, where so many people would be talking about hostages. Honestly, until my dad returned, I didn’t really believe it either—it felt like a nightmare, not reality.' She continued: 'Not far from here, my parents and my best friend were kidnapped. This is a place I have a love-hate relationship with—love for the landscape, the people, the community, and hate because of the fear, the race to the bomb shelter. I’m used to bad things happening here, but I didn’t realize just how horrific the situation had become. Since then, I’ve been on a tumultuous journey of anxiety and fear, disappointment with those who were supposed to take responsibility, and the realization that the responsibility is on all of us. A journey of pleading, of hugs and connections, which taught us so much.' 'We went through hell, but today I want to talk about the good. Every day in captivity, my dad asked the hostages to name one thing they could be grateful for. He returned to his faith and would pray and give thanks for what little they had. In hell, small acts of gratitude lit up days of darkness and silence. One of the first questions he asked when he got home was, 'What can I do to bring everyone back?' We leave no one behind—these are values of mutual responsibility, the redemption of captives, and the faith that we must never give up on any of our brothers and sisters.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by1xxlkiye	2025-02-28T12:29:01-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/rkXqjHT5kl/rkXqjHT5kl_0_299_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's meeting with President Donald Trump ended in disaster on Friday, after the two leaders traded verbal blows before the world's media at the White House over the war with Russia. The visit by Zelenskiy was designed to help Ukraine convince the United States not to side with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who ordered the invasion of Ukraine three years ago.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjv5yyyjyl	2025-02-28T10:08:48-08:00	
Explosive argument erupts between Trump, Zelensky in Oval Office ...	You’re running low on soldiers,' Trump told Zelensky during their heated White House meeting, accusing the Ukrainian president of ingratitude and disrespect; The tense exchange over peace negotiations and mineral agreements dissolved into accusations, with Trump declaring, 'I think we’ve seen enough' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had high expectations for his meeting with his American counterpart, Donald Trump, at the White House, emphasizing in the past the importance of meeting before Trump’s discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, it seems that Ukrainian hopes for a shift in the Trump administration’s approach toward Ukraine were completely dashed on Friday evening. The diplomatic summit surrounding the mineral agreement turned into a loud exchange of accusations and harsh, disparaging remarks, culminating in Zelensky effectively being shown the door at the White House. Trump has recently displayed a hostile attitude toward Zelensky, even referring to him as a 'dictator.' Although the two exchanged a handshake upon Zelensky’s arrival in Washington, tensions quickly escalated, and the strained relationship between the two leaders came to the surface. 'You’re either going to make a deal, or we’re out,' Trump angrily told Zelensky. 'And if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. I don’t think it’s gonna be pretty, but you’ll fight it out. You don’t have the cards. Once we sign that deal, you’re in a much better position, but you’re not acting at all thankful, and that’s not a nice thing. I’ll be honest, that’s not a nice thing.' Trump added, 'Your country is in big trouble. Your people are dying. You’re running low on soldiers. Listen, you’re running low on soldiers. It would be a damn good thing if you could get a ceasefire right now. I tell you, you’d take it so the bullets stop flying and your men stop getting killed. Of course, we want to stop the war, but I’m saying you don’t want a ceasefire, do you?' At the height of the argument, the two began speaking over each other, and Trump used the moment to take a jab at his predecessor, Joe Biden: 'That wasn’t with me. That was with a guy named Biden, who was not a smart person. That was, excuse me, that was with Obama who gave you sheets, and I gave you javelins to take out all those tanks. Obama gave you sheets. In fact, the statement is Obama gave sheets, and Trump gave javelins.' Zelensky retorted dismissively, 'In three days—I’ve heard that from Putin.' Trump responded, 'It’s going to be very hard to do business like this. I'd just say thank you.' During the argument, Trump also said, 'You’re not showing any gratitude at all. That’s not nice. I’ll be honest—it’s not nice.' He further mocked Zelensky in a dismissive tone, saying, 'Then you’ll say, ‘I don’t want a ceasefire, I don’t want a ceasefire! I want to go and I want this.’' Shortly thereafter, Trump addressed the media: 'I think we’ve seen enough. What do you think? Uh, this is gonna be great television, I will say that.' Following the meeting, Trump posted an official statement on his X account (formerly Twitter): 'We had a significant meeting at the White House. I recognized that Zelensky is not ready for peace if America is involved because he believes our involvement gives him a huge advantage in negotiations. I don’t want an advantage—I want peace. He demonstrated disrespect toward the United States in the Oval Office. He can return when he’s ready for peace.' U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance, who was also present at the meeting, likewise accused Zelensky of disrespect. Zelensky responded, 'I signed a ceasefire in 2019, but Putin violated it and launched a full-scale attack on Ukraine in 2022. What diplomacy are you talking about, J.D.?' Vance replied, 'I think it’s disrespectful of you to come into the Oval Office and try to debate this in front of the American media.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: This difficult meeting came despite a relatively positive statement from Zelensky beforehand, in which he claimed he 'thought Trump was on their side.' The Ukrainian president demanded that Trump 'not compromise with a murderer,' referring, of course, to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who started the war with Ukraine. The mineral agreement discussed in recent days would allow the United States access to Ukrainian minerals but does not provide a security guarantee in return, a disappointment for Ukraine. Trump, however, argues that American business involvement would provide a form of security guarantee. Zelensky had hoped to use the meeting with Trump and his visit to Washington to bolster American support, which has shifted since the change in administration. Under President Biden, Ukraine received billions of dollars in weapons and ammunition from the United States. Trump, on the other hand, seeks to reclaim the funds provided as support to Ukraine and bring an end to the war while strengthening U.S.-Russia relations. 'I hope to be remembered as the one who brought peace,' Trump said, praising Ukrainian soldiers for their bravery. The American president made it clear to his Ukrainian counterpart that 'the United States wants to bring the war to an end and invest the funds in other priorities like rebuilding efforts.' Before the meeting, Trump told the media that a ceasefire agreement between Ukraine and Russia was close and described the upcoming mineral deal as very fair. According to the agreement, Ukraine would transfer 50% of the revenues from government-owned minerals to a reconstruction fund jointly managed by American and Ukrainian ownership. The agreement, however, does not specify exactly how these funds will be used. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjjshf1skl	2025-02-28T10:02:33-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/28/H1r11eF1jke/H1r11eF1jke_0_120_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Keith Siegel on captivity: 'living with shortness of breath, ches...	Keith Siegel described horrific conditions during his Hamas captivity, including being held in tunnels and moved 33 times; Meeting with Minister of Housing and Construction Yitzhak Goldknopf, Siegel emphasized the urgent need to rescue remaining hostages and shared his recovery journey Keith Siegel, a survivor of captivity, shared his experiences during his time as a hostage held by Hamas in a meeting with Minister of Housing and Construction Yitzhak Goldknopf. Keith revealed that he was held at times with his wife, as well as with other hostages, and was transferred to different locations no fewer than 33 times, including two tunnels and two schools in the Gaza Strip. Keith recounted that during the abduction on the day of the massacre, 'We went through three vehicles. They kidnapped us from our home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza using my car, and when we entered Gaza, they transferred us to a local vehicle, and after some time, they transferred us again. They also placed a bag over our heads so we couldn’t see. I don’t know how long it lasted, but from there, we arrived at a house, and from it, we descended into a tunnel. We were kept in that tunnel for three days. After that, we came out for a period of two or three weeks, and then we were taken back into a tunnel again.' Keith described the second tunnel where he was held as 'particularly deep—they told us it was 40 meters underground. We had to walk 15 steps to get to the bathroom, which had no air. It was like living with shortness of breath, chest pain, and pressure. They left us there alone from about 5:00 PM until 8:00 AM the next morning. If something had happened to us, there was no one to talk to. They told us, 'If there's a problem, go to the stairs and call for us to come.' One night, while I was with my wife, another hostage with us wasn’t feeling well and needed medication. 'We went and shouted at them, but no one came until we gave up. We returned, and only the next morning did the terrorists arrive. Even getting out of that tunnel was an ordeal. Part of the way, we climbed improvised stairs, and at another part, we crawled to the exit. We emerged from the tunnel miraculously, after all three of us were exhausted and dehydrated. We received very little water and food.' Keith also shared that he was transferred between no fewer than 33 locations during his captivity, including two schools, and was held with other hostages, including one young hostage. 'I remember all 33 dates; that’s how many times they moved us,' Keith said, noting that he could identify the locations and even name the terrorists. The meeting with Goldknopf took place last week and was organized by media figure Israel Cohen, who works to connect hostage families with the ultra-Orthodox community. During the meeting, the minister said to Keith: 'It was important for me to meet you and hear about the horrors you experienced at the hands of the despicable terrorists in Gaza. My thoughts are constantly with the hostages who remain in captivity after the conclusion of this phase of the deal. As I’ve done so far, I will continue to support any deal. Your descriptions reinforce what we already knew—that this is a matter of saving lives and the utmost necessity.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Earlier on Thursday, Keith and his wife Aviva, who was released during the first hostage deal, met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara. Their daughter Shir, who became a prominent figure in the fight for the hostages' release, also participated in the meeting. Netanyahu’s office stated that Keith 'wanted to thank the Prime Minister for his efforts to secure his release and that of other hostages.' Additionally, Shir and Aviva 'also expressed their gratitude to the Prime Minister’s wife, Sara, for her work on behalf of the hostages’ release.' During what was described as a warm meeting, the Prime Minister and his wife told the Siegel family that 'together with all of Israel, they are deeply moved to see Keith back home.' Netanyahu said that he had promised Aviva and Shir that Keith would return home and was happy that this promise had been fulfilled. Sara added that the hostages were freed thanks to the courage, bravery, and sacrifice of the soldiers in battle. She also noted that she 'personally witnesses the extraordinary efforts the Prime Minister is making for the sacred mission of bringing back all of our hostages.' Keith shared with them the hardships he endured in captivity, his struggles, and the process of recovery since his return. 'For me, the story isn’t over. While I’ve returned, the responsibility lies with me and with you to bring everyone back. Our friends are still there, and it’s hard for me to return knowing they remain. I know you’re doing a lot—keep showing courage and leadership,' he told them. The Prime Minister responded, 'I am constantly working to secure the release of the remaining hostages. I will not give up on anyone.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry6e28js1x	2025-02-28T07:04:36-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/BJbbnKVA5Jx/BJbbnKVA5Jx_0_0_1920_1080_0_small.jpg

Israeli Navy foiled Hamas infiltration by sea on Oct. 7, but dead...	IDF probe finds Navy forces quickly repelled Hamas' amphibious attack, eliminating most infiltrators; failure to stop all terrorists allowed 16 to reach Zikim beach and murder 17 people On October 7, the battle at sea ended in less than an hour thanks to a swift response from IDF Navy forces, even though no reinforcements were sent to the coastline overnight, even after warning signs emerged. The Navy had even been instructed not to raise its alert level, yet still managed to eliminate about half of the Hamas terrorists who attempted to infiltrate by sea. However, those who did make it ashore murdered 17 people at Zikim beach, near the Gaza border. As part of the IDF’s core investigations into the failures of October 7, released Thursday for the first time since the attack, the military reviewed the Navy’s response. The investigation found that the rapid reaction of the Ashdod-based 916th Flotilla, which was on routine patrol off the Gaza coast that morning, was key in quickly ending the battle. The IDF’s Southern Command and the Gaza Division had not issued warnings about unusual activity the night before the massacre and the Navy also did not reinforce its presence despite signs of an impending attack. However, the commander of the Navy’s elite unit did arrive at the Ashdod base overnight and an additional patrol boat was placed on standby for rapid deployment. The decision was made after a late-night update from Gaza Division commander Brig. Gen. Avi Rosenfeld to the Ashdod base commander regarding suspicious signals. Despite this, the navy was explicitly ordered not to increase its alert level. 'Do not conduct unusual activity at sea so that Hamas does not realize we are watching them more closely tonight due to the warning signs,' the directive said. Timeline of the attack At 6:29 a.m., the Navy’s surveillance detected hundreds of large Palestinian fishing boats along the coast, under whose cover Hamas naval commandos launched their attack. Four minutes later, at 6:33 a.m., the Ashdod naval base declared a confirmed terror attack from the sea, issuing an alert equivalent to the IDF’s highest-level ground incursion protocol. At 6:37 a.m., the Navy requested that Israeli police evacuate Zikim beach and called on the Gaza Division to send infantry forces to secure the shore, in case some of the terrorists managed to breach Israel’s defenses. However, in a disturbing incident that has yet to be explained by Southern Command, an infantry force deployed to the area failed to engage the Hamas squad that landed at Zikim beach. Instead, the soldiers lay on the ground about 100 meters (330 feet) away and later retreated. The terrorists then seized their open-top vehicle and drove toward nearby Kibbutz Zikim. A Navy lookout, noticing the failure to stop the terrorists, took the initiative and called the Zikim security chief, warning him about the incoming threat. The security chief managed to mobilize the local emergency alert squad, which intercepted and killed the terrorists before they could reach the kibbutz. In total, the navy destroyed five of the seven Hamas boats at sea, killing 22 out of the 38 terrorists who attempted an amphibious invasion. However, 16 terrorists successfully made it ashore. Navy officers acknowledge shortcomings 'The forces responded quickly and decisively but our weapons weren’t lethal enough,' navy officers admitted in the investigation. 'In one instance, a commander hesitated for a full minute before opening fire on an enemy boat due to restrictive engagement rules that have been in place since 2014’s Operation Protective Edge.' 'We failed in our mission to defend Israel from the sea,' The report concluded. 'We were not prepared for such a large-scale surprise attack — only for a more limited infiltration scenario.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkvjewr9ye	2025-02-28T04:41:51-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/10/SJzORGRhR/SJzORGRhR_2_43_802_452_0_small.jpg
IDF troops fire warning shots in southern Syria, protests break o...	Syrian media reports Israeli forces searching homes collected information on residents before firing warning shots when locals gathered around them; shortly after, demonstrators near Damascus protest Israeli control in border region Israeli forces entered the Syrian village of Rafeed, south of Quneitra, on Friday morning, searching several homes before withdrawing after clashes with residents, the IDF said. According to the military, dozens of Syrians gathered in front of the soldiers during the searches, prompting troops to fire warning shots into the air to disperse the crowd before leaving the area. Syrian media claimed the soldiers were not only conducting searches but also 'gathering information on residents' in the village. Shortly after the incident, dozens of people gathered in the city of Douma, near Damascus, to protest what they called 'ongoing Israeli violations in southern Syria.' Demonstrators carried signs opposing Israeli control in the border region, with messages proclaiming 'the Syrian people are united.' The protests come days after Israeli airstrikes targeted multiple sites in Syria, attacks for which Israel took responsibility. Some demonstrators reportedly called on Syrian rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa to 'strike Tel Aviv' in response. On Monday, protests erupted across Syria following remarks by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called for 'the complete demilitarization of southern Syria from the new regime's forces' and vowed to protect the country’s Druze population. 'We will not tolerate any threat against the Druze community in southern Syria,' Netanyahu said, adding that Israeli forces would remain stationed 'in the Mount Hermon area and the buffer zone indefinitely.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Demonstrations took place in multiple locations, including Bosra al-Sham, east of Daraa, as well as in Sweida and Quneitra. Footage from the protests showed demonstrators waving the Syrian flag and chanting slogans against Israel, Jews and Netanyahu himself. A journalist from Quneitra province told Ynet that Netanyahu was trying to 'provoke conflict between Sunnis and Druze,' claiming the Israeli leader was seeking to prolong the war in the region. 'The war in Gaza and Lebanon will eventually end, but he is doing everything he can to extend his rule in Israel by provoking Syria,' the journalist said. 'After 14 years of war against Iran, Hezbollah and the Assad regime, another war cannot be ignited.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkg7yn1iyg	2025-02-28T04:32:15-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/28/SkZp74kikl/SkZp74kikl_0_61_1279_721_0_small.jpg
IDF Northern Command chief: Israel will stand firm against any th...	Northern Command chief Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin warned Thursday that Israel would not tolerate any threats or violations of the cease-fire agreement along its northern border. 'We will not accept any threat or breach of the agreement—we will stand firm against any enemy, strike when necessary and prevent any danger,' Gordin said at a ceremony honoring wounded soldiers. Speaking at the event, Gordin praised the resilience of those injured in battle, emphasizing their role in Israel’s strength. 'In the face of rapidly evolving challenges, one thing remains certain—we have a strong nation, and you are the proof of that,' he said. He also thanked the wounded soldiers for their sacrifice. 'You did not think of your own personal well-being but of the good of the country,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1kiwn1syx	2025-02-28T04:18:00-08:00	
Israel wants to extend first phase of Gaza truce by six weeks, Eg...	An Israeli delegation in Cairo aims to negotiate to extend the first phase of the Gaza cease-fire deal by an additional 42 days, two Egyptian security sources said on Friday. Hamas opposes the extension and insists on proceeding to the second phase of the deal as originally agreed, the sources told Reuters. The second phase is meant to include steps leading to a permanent end to the war. The first phase of the cease-fire is set to end on Saturday, and the warring parties have yet to clarify what will happen if no agreement is reached by then. Egypt and Qatar are mediating the talks, with U.S. support. In a statement on Friday, the Palestinian terrorist group urged the international community to press Israel to immediately enter the second phase without any delay. Two Israeli government officials had told Reuters that Israel was seeking to extend the initial phase, with Hamas freeing three hostages each week in exchange for Palestinians held by Israel.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjkgvvjj1g	2025-02-28T04:15:45-08:00	
Begin’s unpublished writings to be released on 33rd anniversary o...	In newly revealed 65-page document, former prime minister warns Israel must remain strong to deter its enemies and calls for an independent judiciary free from government pressure A collection of previously unseen documents, letters and articles written by former Prime Minister Menachem Begin will be made public next week, coinciding with the 33rd anniversary of his death. Among the handwritten papers is a document outlining Begin’s views on human rights, the need for a constitution and the tension between the judiciary and the legislature. In 1952, Begin wrote a 65-page paper titled A Personal View, A National View and Basic Principles. Due to austerity measures in the young state of Israel, he drafted it on discarded rolls of paper from a printing press. 'There is no justice without courts,' Begin wrote. 'Justices are but flesh and blood and may make mistakes, be bribed or afraid, but the determinative role of the court in our society is not the human weaknesses of any particular judge but the ‘psychological position’ given to that institution and those who sit in judgment.' He argued that both the judiciary and authorities must uphold the courts’ complete independence. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Herzl Makov, CEO of the Menachem Begin Heritage Center, described the documents as a reflection of Begin’s political philosophy and humility. 'It is a sharp political analysis that distills Begin’s liberal-national worldview,' he said. In the writings, Begin also addressed Israel’s territorial aspirations and the necessity of national might. He warned that Israel’s security depended on its power. 'Anyone with eyes in his head knows that when we are strong, we will not be attacked by the Arabs, even without signed agreements. And if we are weak, our Arab enemies will rise to destroy us, even if such agreements are forged in diplomacy.' Begin criticized Israel’s early leaders for conceding historical lands, lamenting that they agreed to establish the state without key biblical sites within its borders. 'National leaders were found willing to sign, in the name of the people of Israel, that Jerusalem, Hebron, Bethlehem, Jericho, Nablus and all the good land east of the Jordan would not be ours. Is there a national-historic crime equal to this?' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkukk7jj1g	2025-02-28T03:41:06-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/28/BkTacJyi1e/BkTacJyi1e_3_0_852_479_0_small.jpg
U.S. leaders would push for immediate return of Israeli hostages,...	Former IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus says U.S. leaders have been specifically emphasizing that all remaining Israeli hostages, including four Americans, should be returned immediately The U.S. administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has relayed the message that if they were in charge in Israel, they would 'do things differently,' according to former IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus. He said U.S. leaders have been specifically emphasizing that all remaining Israeli hostages, including four Americans, should be returned immediately—'not that it would be a deal that would take a lot of time to implement, but to return the Israeli hostages together and to do it quickly.' Conricus added that he believes this will be an important angle in the ongoing hostage-for-ceasefire negotiations taking place in Cairo.

Pre-military academy honors fallen soldier Regev Amar	Russell Robinson: 'To be able to participate, open something so quickly, and see so many young people… you feel the energy of tomorrow here' Fifty students, parents, and supporters gathered in Kibbutz Sde Nehemia, near the Lebanese border, to unveil new signs and renovated buildings at a pre-military academy where students sleep, learn, and spend time. The academy is named after Staff Sergeant Regev Amar and is located on the kibbutz where he was raised. Amar was killed in battle while defending Kibbutz Kissufim on October 7. His family sought to honor his memory by educating the next generation in his name. The Upper Galilee Leadership Institute established the new pre-military program in Amar’s honor, with the support of donors like JNF-USA. Thanks to hundreds of thousands of shekels in donations, students from across Israel who are about to enlist now have access to this unique program. 'In honor of Regev, who lost his life trying to protect our Jewish nation, his mother Gilanit had a dream—this is something he would have wanted,' said Russell Robinson, CEO of Jewish National Fund-USA. 'To be able to participate, open something so quickly, and see so many young people… you feel the energy of tomorrow here.' 'He was really an inspiration for all of us,' added Amos Moshe, a friend of Amar's. 'Everyone remembers him. After October 7, after Regev died, the whole kibbutz changed. Everything became a memorial. It’s hard, but it’s also very emotional to create so many memories of one true friend—everyone knew him. That’s why the whole kibbutz came together today.' Amar’s friends and family were in tears as the ceremony took place. The program officially opened its doors in August.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjhgvq1sye	2025-02-28T03:12:21-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/28/SJcxdQkoyl/SJcxdQkoyl_0_0_734_418_0_small.jpg
Annexation debate: Will Israeli sovereignty bring security or glo...	Annexation would force Israel to choose between two difficult paths: denying Palestinians citizenship and becoming an apartheid state or granting them equal rights and risking the country's Jewish majority and national identity,' says Dan Perry It's been nearly four weeks since former U.S. President Donald Trump said he'd soon reveal his stance on the issue of enacting Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. If he gives the go-ahead, what would that mean for Israel, the Palestinians, and the wider region? Would this move strengthen security and stability—or trigger a global backlash? And why are Christian conservatives and U.S. Republicans rallying behind it? These were the questions debated this week on ILTV's Insider. Dan Perry, former chief editor of the Associated Press (AP) for the Middle East, Africa, and the Caribbean, warned that Israel should not annex the entire West Bank 'because the long-term costs would outweigh any short-term gains in sovereignty or security. ' Malkah Fleisher, an influencer and settler, took the opposite view. The co-founder of B'yadaim Shelanu, a women's security initiative in Judea and Samaria, said failing to enact sovereignty has 'only earned international contempt and local Arab derision. We have gained nothing from the lie of a two-state solution and from giving land away to a foreign entity.' According to Perry, annexation would force Israel to choose between two difficult paths: denying Palestinians citizenship and becoming an apartheid state or granting them equal rights and risking the country's Jewish majority and national identity. Today, nearly three million Palestinians live in Judea and Samaria, primarily in Areas A and B, which are under Palestinian Authority control. In the same region, approximately 465,000 Jews reside in Area C. Inside Israel's pre-1967 borders, known as inside the 'Green Line,' including Jerusalem, there are 7.2 million Jews and two million Arabs. Perry argued that neither scenario is sustainable for Israel. However, if annexation moves forward, he believes Israel would likely sacrifice its democratic character. 'It would create a system where two populations live under one authority but with vastly different rights,' he said. The result, he warned, 'would erode Israel's moral standing, risk a major outbreak of violence, and gradually invite global pariah status, which would crush Israel's export-driven economy.' But Fleisher disagrees. She told ILTV that it should be clear to everyone that the Oslo doctrine has been a 'colossal failure.' 'The areas that have been given over to the control of the Palestinian Authority have become jihadist and Judenrein,' Fleisher said. 'October 7 is all the proof any logical Israeli should need that when Israel loses control over parts of its land and allows jihadists to take over; it is a recipe for attacks against us.' She argued that the IDF has repeatedly emphasized the need to prepare for another large-scale attack originating from Judea and Samaria. 'With huge Hamas strongholds like Hebron being left to their own devices to strengthen and reinforce terrorist ideology, including its cynical brainwashing of its children, we are leaving ourselves vulnerable to an attack at any time,' Fleisher contended. 'Israel taking control of these areas, forcing out terrorist hegemony, ripping out jihadist educational curriculum, and expelling anti-Israel elements, we are providing security that has eluded Israel throughout its history.' Watch previous issues of ILTV Insider: Is Israel Winning This War, Or Just Prolonging The Inevitable? Is Trump’s Gaza Strategy a Diplomatic Breakthrough or a Disaster? Should Israel Consider a Nuclear Strike on Iran? Fleisher also emphasized Judea and Samaria's deep historical and religious significance to the Jewish people. She noted that many key landmarks—such as the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem, and the site of the first Tabernacle in Shiloh—are located there. In her view, the real question is not whether Israel should enact sovereignty but what the status of non-Jews would be in the newly annexed territory. 'The question is not whether Israel should govern [this territory], but what the status is of other peoples living in our land,' Fleisher said. 'We cannot allow the difficulty of this question to undermine the truth and the rationality of the Jewish people holding on to its land.' Perry, however, argued that if Trump does greenlight some form of annexation, Israel's far-right leaders would likely choose to annex Area C—where most Jewish communities are already located—rather than the entire West Bank. While this would leave disconnected Palestinian enclaves under Palestinian Authority control, he said it would carry fewer risks than full annexation. Fleisher rejected that idea as well. She said that being 'generous' by '[our] willingness to gift [the land] to a terror state as a way of seeming moderate and praiseworthy in the eyes of the international community, in reality, [has] only earned international contempt and local Arab derision.' She added, 'We have gained nothing from the lie of a two-state solution and from giving land away to a foreign entity.' On the other hand, Perry warned that fully annexing the West Bank would be disastrous for Israel's diplomatic relations, economic stability, and security. 'Such a move would mark a dramatic departure from decades of international consensus supporting a two-state solution,' he told ILTV. 'Europe, Israel's largest trading partner, could impose severe economic sanctions, undermining Israel's prosperity. Diplomatic isolation would be swift, with countries worldwide condemning the annexation as a violation of international law.' He added that the decision would also threaten Israel's security ties with neighboring countries. 'It would also risk diplomatic and security ties with neighboring countries like Jordan and Egypt and end the prospects for wider peace in the region,' Perry continued. 'Both nations would face domestic pressure to sever peace agreements with Israel, potentially destabilizing regional security—and it would end prospects for wider peace.' Moreover, he argued that such a move would make Israel a partisan issue in the United States, alienating young liberal Americans, including many American Jews. He said Israel's challenge is not choosing between democracy and Judaism but balancing both. 'Israel should never be tempted to think that theocracy or suicidal ultranationalist fantasies are somehow more Jewish,' he said. Fleisher balked at this idea. Instead, she told ILTV that the world is shifting 'back to healthy nationalism and common sense,' and many countries are looking to Israel for courage, strength, and honesty. 'The American president and administration and the American people are strongly behind us, maybe more vociferously than ever before, as they too fight to rectify the takeover of broken progressive ideas and practices that have been leading their country down the wrong path,' Fleisher said. 'India, Argentina, Hungary, Poland, and more have shown interest in and solidarity with a strong Israel – not to mention Saudi Arabia.' According to Fleisher, when Israel stands firm in its beliefs, it earns respect. But when it succumbs to international pressure, its weakness becomes a tool for its enemies. She argued that the Trump administration has taken a 'stronger and prouder' nationalist stance on Israel than Israel itself has and that Israel's democratic values should not be mistaken for being identical to those of the United States. 'Israel is first and foremost a nation-state and a defensive one at that,' Fleisher said. 'Democracy is a value, but it is not above Judaism or the Jewish people. It has in it beautiful principles that Israel cares about, but it was meant to be a system that helped Israel enhance and actualize itself, not destroy itself.' Perry strongly disagreed. 'Israel was founded as both a Jewish and democratic state, and ultimately, its long-term security and prosperity depend on remaining both,' he argued. 'Annexation threatens this delicate balance because it would wipe out the Jews' demographic majority. That, then, is the irony: annexation, while motivated by religious Jewish fanaticism, does not make the country more but less Jewish in any way that is rooted in actual life in the real world.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk15pgyj1e	2025-02-28T02:36:22-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/16/r1fUqXyVdR/r1fUqXyVdR_1_166_1601_901_0_small.jpg

Minute by minute, the orders issued in response to 1st wave of Oc...	Probe finds IDF HQ failed to produce an accurate situational assessment in the critical early hours and the Operations Directorate was unable to break through the system’s constraints that morning Of all the IDF’s core investigations into the failures of October 7, the easiest was the review of the military’s Operations Directorate. This unit, based in the IDF’s underground command center, directs forces in both routine and emergency situations. Unlike other investigations that relied on commanders’ recollections — after months of combat in Gaza and Lebanon — this facility is monitored and recorded 24/7. At the time, the division was led by Maj. Gen. Shlomi Binder, who was later appointed head of the IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate (MID), replacing Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, who resigned over his role in the failures. The military’s supervising command post, activated within minutes that morning in the IDF’s military headquarters in Tel Aviv, is responsible for allocating and overseeing forces. The investigation found that until 6:29 a.m. on October 7, operations in the Gaza Division were proceeding as normal. At the time, 671 soldiers were stationed in the area, distributed among 14 companies in four regional security battalions. The report concluded that, given the chaos of the attack and the fact that a large-scale invasion was never considered a realistic threat, the deployment of forces was reasonable. Many commanders and soldiers rushed to the battlefield of their own accord. 'The General Staff’s operations center failed to produce an accurate situational assessment in the critical early hours and the Operations Directorate was unable to break through the system’s constraints that morning,' the report read. 'It was a catastrophic event with no outstanding performances or real-time feedback. There was also difficulty assessing the readiness of command posts in the Gaza Division.' However, the investigation also found that 'the decisions made in the first hours were reasonable, though in some locations, forces were not fully utilized. There were also gaps in the Air Force’s firepower deployment, particularly using fighter jets. While force mobilization aligned with readiness protocols, oversight of troop deployment was inadequate.' Fighting with no intelligence The investigation was conducted without cooperation from the Shin Bet and Israel Police, due to both security restrictions and a deliberate decision to prevent coordination of testimonies in the event of a future state commission of inquiry. 'We fought an entire day without intelligence,' IDF Southern Command officers said in the report, noting that the MID failed to detect thousands of terrorist phone and radio signals inside Israel. 'Even if we had 100 fighter jets that morning, we wouldn’t have known what to do with them because we weren’t prepared for this scenario,' one officer said. 'We had no pre-planned aerial attack strategy for even 10% of what took place. 'In the first 24 hours, we carried out 500 strikes in Gaza but the first dedicated attack cell wasn’t set up until 8:30 a.m. because it consisted of reservists who were still at home.' Southern Command chief’s mistakes According to the Southern Command’s internal review, IDF forces — despite being vastly outnumbered — managed to kill about 600 terrorists that morning. Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, who led the Southern Command, had correctly ordered the activation of the 'Parash Pleshet' protocol — an alert for hostile infiltration — but the scale of the attack far exceeded expectations. Soldiers guarding the Gaza border were operating under standard pre-dawn readiness procedures, with additional troops positioned outside at sunrise. Fourteen tanks were manned in the area that morning but one of the Gaza Division’s emergency reserve battalions was away on a training exercise in the Golan Heights, causing significant delays in reinforcements. Finkelman later told investigators that he had to 'reinvent' his forces that morning to respond to an unimaginable scenario. The key decisions he made included: - Prioritizing civilian rescue, rapidly flooding the area with troops despite the risks and lack of coordination. - Dividing the Gaza Division into three new divisions to regain command over forces. - Sealing the border with airstrikes — though belatedly. Finkelman also identified five critical mistakes he made: - Placing too much weight on immediate threats the night before the invasion, despite warning signs. - Failing to gather additional intelligence on both enemy movements and IDF force deployment. - Not initiating a cross-command discussion on closing the border fence, which could have enabled an airstrike an hour and a half earlier. - Not providing sufficient reinforcements to southern Gaza border communities that day. - Failing to establish a faster and safer civilian evacuation plan. Looking back, Finkelman, like many other senior officers, concluded that under no circumstances should terrorist organizations be allowed to establish and grow along Israel’s borders. Command failures on the ground The review of battlefield conduct found no significant cases of soldiers avoiding combat or deserting under fire. However, some IDF officials criticized the decision of Northern Gaza Brigade Commander Col. Haim Cohen to oversee the battle from the operations center rather than the field. His counterpart, Southern Brigade Commander Col. Asaf Hamami, was killed in combat and his body remains in Hamas captivity. Despite the criticism, Cohen’s presence in the command center allowed him to maintain some control over the situation. The human cost The toll of October 7 was devastating. According to IDF data, 1,320 people were murdered or killed that day, including 457 security forces personnel and first responders. Another 251 people were kidnapped to Gaza and thousands were wounded. Minute by minute In total, 5,500 terrorists entered Israel, carrying out a campaign of conquest, mass murder, rape and abduction in the western Negev. They breached 114 openings in the border fence, infiltrating through 59 routes with the aid of 57 drones, six paragliders, seven boats and a massive barrage of 3,889 rockets and mortars throughout the day. The timeline of orders issued by the Operations Directorate, alongside the Southern Command’s investigative chronology, reveals the extent of the chaos that day — and how the IDF was unaware, in real time, of the scale of the massacres unfolding in the kibbutzim and at the Nova music festival: 6:29–7:00 a.m. – The first wave of 1,175 Hamas terrorists, mostly from the elite Nukhba forces, infiltrates southern Israel under cover of a 1,400-rocket and mortar barrage. Their initial targets include IDF outposts, the Gaza Division headquarters, an intelligence base near Urim, the Sderot police station, key intersections and major roads — aiming to secure control over the western Negev. 6:31 a.m. – The IDF’s supervising command post is activated in the IDF’s underground headquarters in Tel Aviv. At the same time, immediate readiness protocols for the Air Force and elite emergency units are enacted. 6:35 a.m. – The Air Force is ordered to deploy additional fighter jet crews beyond its standard readiness level. 6:38 a.m. – The Gaza Division activates 'Parash Pleshet,' its highest-level infiltration alert, assuming the attack involves around 70 terrorists from four to eight locations. Over the next 14 minutes, the Operations Directorate gradually deploys all available reserve ground forces to the southern region. 6:45 a.m. – The first report of a ground incursion from northern Gaza reaches IDF headquarters. 7:00 a.m. – Southern Command are now aware of 15 terror incidents occurring simultaneously along the border. The General Staff opens a dedicated attack coordination center to manage airstrikes from the headquarters. 7:00–9:00 a.m. – A second wave of approximately 600 Nukhba terrorists joins the invasion, under cover of 937 additional rocket and mortar strikes, mostly targeting Israeli communities near the border. 7:05 a.m. – The IDF chief of staff’s military secretary sends an internal WhatsApp message to the Operations Directorate group, independently declaring: 'We are at war.' 7:13 a.m. – The security coordinator of the Nova music festival reports to the IDF that 90% of attendees have been evacuated. 7:14 a.m. – The Air Force conducts its first drone strike against terrorists near Netiv HaAsara. 7:26 a.m. – Officer updates IDF headquarters: 'A breach at the Erez Crossing has resulted in two hostages being taken. There is ongoing combat in Sderot. The division is requesting deployment of every available combat unit to the southern region.' A senior officer at IDF headquarters responds: 'Every IDF unit has been ordered to join you. Open routes for them and direct them where needed. We have activated troops from training bases.' 7:28 a.m. – Brig. Gen. Shlomi Binder, head of the Operations Directorate, orders a full-scale military mobilization. An emergency deployment order is issued to send massive reinforcements to the western Negev. 7:30 a.m. – Units from the 80th Division, responsible for the Egyptian border, arrive from the south to assist. Under the command of the Paran Brigade, a team of female tank operators prevents two Nukhba battalions from seizing communities in the Kerem Shalom area. 7:55 a.m. – The first fighter jet strike targets a Hamas tunnel near Netiv HaAsara. 7:58 a.m. – Fromer Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif calls on Gaza residents via local media: 'Go and storm Israel. There is no border fence.' At that moment, the dramatic decision is made — to be officially executed an hour later — to seal the breached border at all costs using airstrikes. 8:00 a.m. – Southern Command chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman urgently requests additional reinforcements. IDF headquarters decides that two-thirds of the West Bank Division’s security forces will abandon their positions and be rushed south. 8:17 a.m. – The IDF establishes a command center dedicated to managing the hostage crisis. 8:29 a.m. – Investigators later determine that at this stage, only 55% of active terror incidents in the Gaza border communities were being reported to IDF headquarters, further complicating the situational assessment. 8:30 a.m. – Southern Command activates 'Damocles’ Sword,' an operation targeting Hamas’ command and control centers in Gaza to disrupt the ongoing invasion. 8:42 a.m. – The supervising command center orders the air force to target Hamas headquarters and leadership figures. 9:23 a.m. – The Gaza Division is effectively overrun as Nukhba forces besiege its main command center near Kibbutz Re’im. The IDF decided to dispatch division and brigade commanders across the region, assigning each to oversee a major town or community that Hamas had seized, including Ofakim, Netivot, Sderot and Be’er Sheva. 9:40 a.m. – Southern Command and the Air Force order an aerial lockdown of the breached border, authorizing fighter jets to kill anyone moving within a kilometer (0.6 miles) of the fence. The bombing begins but does not fully halt the infiltration. 10:00 a.m. – By this hour, IDF headquarters is receiving reports on 61% of ongoing terror incidents in the southern region. 10:40 a.m. – A bottleneck of military forces is identified in Sderot, where troops have gathered after seeing viral footage of terrorists in pickup trucks. The supervising post orders them to disperse to active combat zones. 12:00 p.m. – The attack reaches its peak as thousands more Hamas terrorists exploit still-open breaches in the border. By this point, approximately 5,500 terrorists have flooded into southern Israel. 1:00 p.m. – The Hamas assault is largely halted, and the IDF begins establishing a new defensive line. By 5:00 p.m., Southern Command announces that operational control over the western Negev has been restored, roads are secured and the last remaining terrorist strongholds are encircled. That night, special forces tracked and eliminated the terrorist cell that had advanced the farthest — between Sde Teiman and Be’er Sheva. The last terrorist inside Israel was killed three days later between Zikim and Ashkelon. Three weeks after the attack, the 162nd Division withdrew from the region to prepare for the IDF’s ground operation in Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkehxlcqyx	2025-02-27T20:45:33-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/H1qSpmRqkx/H1qSpmRqkx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
British PM Starmer calls BBC documentary on Gaza 'concerning'	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer commented Thursday on the production of the BBC documentary investigation on the Gaza Strip, saying: 'I am concerned about the investigation, the Foreign Secretary held a meeting with the BBC on the matter.' The British network issued an apology Thursday, admitting that there were 'serious shortcomings' in the production of the documentary, one of whose participants was revealed to be the son of a senior Hamas figure.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syrtuv0qje	2025-02-27T13:41:09-08:00

There were 5 warning signs the night before the Hamas invasion, b...	To understand intelligence failure that led to October 7, it is enough to examine the evening and night before attack; IDF probe shows how those few hours encapsulates the entire flawed intelligence assessment; 'The border was so quiet that I had nothing to write in my daily report' To understand the intelligence failure that led to the October 7 disaster, it is enough to examine the evening and night before the Hamas attack. According to IDF investigators, that period encapsulated the entire flawed intelligence assessment. No fewer than five warning signs were received by Military Intelligence (Aman) and the Southern Command in those hours, including dozens of SIM cards from mobile phones that were activated in Gaza, suspicious movements in Hamas’ rocket deployment, and other unclear indicators. Despite this, intelligence officials found plausible explanations for each warning, primarily arguing that similar incidents had occurred in the weeks, months and years preceding the war. These findings were outlined in an IDF investigation into the night before the massacre, published Thursday as part of the military’s core inquiries. Meanwhile, the establishment of a state commission of inquiry remains nowhere in sight. Despite the grave failures and numerous mistakes uncovered, no personal conclusions have been drawn, and Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi has left disciplinary measures and command decisions to his successor, Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to the investigation, signs of Hamas activity were attributed to the organization's general concerns and an assessment that stemmed from an Israeli cabinet meeting the previous week. Leaked details from that meeting suggested that Israel was considering assassinating senior Hamas figures in Gaza in response to terror plots emanating from the Strip targeting the West Bank, particularly in the area of Huwara. Systemic intelligence failures Southern Command planned to respond to these signs the following day by increasing aerial surveillance. However, the accumulation of warning signs did not even lead to the lowest level of intelligence alert. As a result, after a joint nighttime assessment, Southern Command Chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman and Chief of Staff Halevi decided not to raise the alert or readiness levels of the 671 soldiers stationed with the Gaza Division for the Simchat Torah holiday. On October 7, 157 of them were killed in battle. Throughout the summer of 2023, Hamas organized violent riots along the Gaza border on Fridays. However, on Friday, October 6, the border was unusually quiet, which only reinforced a sense of complacency. Some commanders even brought their children to spend the holiday with them on base. When a heightened alert was eventually issued, senior combat commanders at the brigade level were recalled, but battalion commanders on weekend leave were allowed to remain on break. 'The border was so quiet that I had nothing to write in my daily report,' a duty intelligence officer told investigators. Other commanders also testified that they took advantage of the rare calm to leave the area for the first time after many tense weekends along the border. The investigation found that the primary intelligence failures that night stemmed from the lack of a structured intelligence assessment. Instead, officials relied on entrenched assumptions to explain away the warning signs, preventing any alert about potential terrorist activity. Additionally, excessive emphasis was placed on protecting intelligence sources at the expense of increasing troop readiness. The abundance of information also blurred the lines of responsibility between intelligence-gathering units and analysis teams, affecting the operational-intelligence discourse. The report further revealed that a culture of remote work, using encrypted communication systems, led intelligence centers to act more as intermediaries than as proactive analysts. Unit 8200’s deafening failure One of the most critical failures that night was the reluctance to expose intelligence-gathering methods, such as surveillance techniques. As in many previous cases, this led to a decision not to inform soldiers and commanders of warning signs — though they did not reach the threshold of an official attack alert — so that Hamas, which monitors Israeli movements, would not realize its covert activities had been detected. However, according to the IDF’s probe, there were also numerous 'reassuring' signs that night. Some of the warning signals were perceived as 'fragments of understanding,' meaning not all relevant personnel were exposed to them. Senior officials in Military Intelligence, Southern Command, and even Air Force officers — who were asked to prepare two surveillance drones and raise the alert level of air defense units — only received partial information. The nighttime assessments were primarily conducted by three General Staff members: Chief of Staff Halevi, Southern Command Chief Finkelman, and Operations Directorate Head Maj. Gen. Oded Basiuk. Air Force Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar was not briefed at all. Military Intelligence Chief Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva was informed but did not participate in the nighttime situation assessment. The events of those hours expose a fundamental failure in Unit 8200’s intelligence-gathering efforts. For years, the unit primarily focused on tracking senior Hamas leaders. As a deliberate policy, there was no active surveillance of lower-ranking commanders or operatives, let alone the hundreds of communication devices that were activated that night and throughout October 7. 'There was no geolocation data from Military Intelligence — not even on October 7 — despite thousands of terrorists’ phones and radios operating for hours inside Israel,' the investigation stated. 'We were deaf and blind on both sides of October 7, even on Friday afternoon, when Hamas began preparing for the invasion — from dozens of operatives initially briefed on the plan, to hundreds by Friday evening, and to thousands of Gazans overnight. One captured terrorist even said during interrogation that he had time to say goodbye to his family over the phone and call his commander in Gaza to report that he was returning because he had forgotten his RPG.' The investigation concluded: 'Enhanced preparedness could have been achieved without compromising intelligence sources. There was no negligence that night, but there was a rigid mindset — no one understood or declared it a time-sensitive event requiring immediate action. If a single authority had had the full picture that night, it is likely an alert would have been issued. That night, the IDF had a rare opportunity to correct years of flawed assumptions — and perhaps at least disrupt the invasion.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/h1zianrq1l	2025-02-27T13:23:07-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/20/SJb70czHye/SJb70czHye_0_0_853_481_0_small.jpg
BBC apologizes for Gaza documentary, citing 'serious flaws'	Spokesperson says network not informed about familial ties of 13-year-old boy featured in Gaza: How To Survive A Warzone, later discovered to be son of senior Hamas official The BBC issued a formal apology for its documentary on Gaza, 'Gaza: How To Survive A Warzone,' admitting to 'serious flaws' in its production. The network stated that it has no plans to broadcast the film again in its current form or make it available on iPlayer. The documentary, produced by Hoyo Films for the BBC, has sparked significant controversy. In its statement, the BBC acknowledged that both the production company and the network made 'unacceptable mistakes.' The BBC took full responsibility for the errors and their impact on the corporation's reputation, expressing regret and apologizing for the situation. Hoyo Films, which produced the documentary, defended the film’s goal, saying it aimed to amplify voices that had not been adequately represented during the war, ensuring they were portrayed 'with dignity and respect.' The company stated it is fully cooperating with the BBC to determine where mistakes were made. A BBC spokesperson added that the network had not been informed ahead of time about the familial ties of a 13-year-old boy featured in the documentary, later discovered to be the son of a senior Hamas official. The BBC had questioned Hoyo Films multiple times during production about possible connections between the boy's family and Hamas, but the company admitted after the broadcast that they were aware the boy's father was a Deputy Agriculture Minister in the Hamas-led Gaza government. The BBC called it a failure on its part for not uncovering the information before the broadcast. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Furthermore, Hoyo Films informed the BBC that it had paid the boy's mother a 'limited sum of money' for his narration in the documentary, through his sister's bank account. While the production company assured the BBC that no payments were made to Hamas members or affiliates, the BBC is now requesting additional confirmation and will conduct a full audit of the documentary’s budget, including a review of Hoyo Films' financial records. The BBC also stated that the issue has 'damaged' public trust in its journalism, with the Director-General requesting that the handling of public complaints be expedited. The BBC’s Editorial Complaints Unit, which operates separately from its news division, will review the situation, and a comprehensive fact-finding inquiry is set to take place. This review will assess whether any editorial guidelines were violated and determine if disciplinary actions are warranted. In a separate statement, the BBC’s board acknowledged that the documentary's subject matter was a legitimate area for journalistic exploration. However, the board emphasized that nothing is more important than trust and transparency in its work. While it recognized that mistakes can occur, it concluded that the errors in this case were serious and damaging to the BBC's reputation. 'We have no plans to broadcast the program again in its current form or return it to iPlayer and will make a further assessment once the work of the Editorial Complaints Unit is complete,' the BBC spokesperson said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyau5ucqyl	2025-02-27T13:09:49-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/20/HylaktDV5ke/HylaktDV5ke_0_0_2250_1267_0_small.jpg
AG orders criminal probe into Netanyahu's office over ties to Qat...	Attorney General calls for criminal investigation into prime minister's advisers over alleged ties to Qatar, including a PR campaign promoting the Gulf state; probe, led by Shin Bet and Israel Police, raises concerns about foreign influence Israel’s Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara announced on Thursday that her office will launch an investigation into connections between officials in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office and individuals linked to Qatar. According to Baharav-Miara, during a discussion attended by the state attorney, the head of the Israel Police’s Investigations and Intelligence Division, and Shin Bet professionals, information was presented regarding ties between individuals operating within the Prime Minister’s Office and entities associated with Qatar. The probe will be conducted by the Shin Bet and the police. Authorities believe the suspicions against the Prime Minister’s Office officials involve abuse of power and actions taken while in a conflict of interest. The case involves three of Netanyahu’s associates: Eli Feldstein, his spokesman, who was previously investigated in a classified documents leak case; and advisers Yonatan Orich and Yisrael Einhorn, who are also suspects in that case. Einhorn has been abroad since the scandal broke. The decision marks an escalation, shifting the case from a security review to a criminal investigation. Suspects will now be questioned under caution, not merely as witnesses. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Feldstein, though not formally employed by the PM’s office, reportedly received payment from a private international firm for managing a PR campaign promoting Qatar’s image in Israel. The campaign focused on Qatar’s role in hostage deal negotiations, with Feldstein arranging interviews with Qatari officials and disseminating their messages. This took place while Qatar mediated regional talks, despite Netanyahu’s criticism of the Gulf state for 'serving Hamas.' Orich and Einhorn allegedly provided PR consulting to Qatar, including a 2022 campaign ahead of the FIFA World Cup, aimed at portraying Qatar — a known funder of terrorism — as a legitimate supporter of regional peace. Einhorn’s firm, Perception, partnered with another company, Coyote, co-owned by retired Brig. Gen. Eli Ben-Meir, a former IDF intelligence official now leading an investigation into the October 7 attacks. All individuals involved have denied the allegations. Netanyahu called the probe a 'witch hunt' against him and his team, while opposition leader Yair Lapid warned of 'an Arab state’s infiltration into the Prime Minister’s Office.' 'Netanyahu’s closest aides received large sums of money. This isn’t just corruption — it’s a dangerous threat to national security,' Lapid added. Qatar, one of the world’s wealthiest nations and a key Hamas funder, has long used its financial influence to gain leverage globally. Reports of payments to Netanyahu’s associates have raised concerns about similar efforts in Israel. Netanyahu has denied any influence from the payments, claiming funds sent to Gaza were for humanitarian purposes, not Hamas. The Shin Bet remains the sole body authorized to investigate the matter, with Lapid stressing: 'The suspects cannot fire the Shin Bet chief to control the probe.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjltjhcc1g	2025-02-27T12:18:32-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/r1rAKDiFJe/r1rAKDiFJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

In first public statement since release, 80-year-old emphasizes urgency to continue hostage releases, saying: 'Every moment counts, I was freed after 482 days — by sheer luck, I made it out alive' Less than a month after his release from captivity in Gaza, 80-year-old Gadi Mozes from Kibbutz Nir Oz issued his first public statement Thursday, addressing the Israeli public and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a recorded message. 'I was there, and I suffered. I witnessed the horrors our people endure in captivity,' Moses said. 'Mr. Prime Minister, every day is critical — critical to the survival of our remaining hostages, critical to our ability to bring our fallen home for burial in Israel.' Mozes was freed in the first phase of the hostage deal after 482 days in captivity. He was held alone by Islamic Jihad, as was Arbel Yehoud, who was released with him. In the same exchange, IDF lookout Agam Berger was freed from a separate location. Even before reuniting with his family, Mozes vowed upon his release: 'I will do everything in my power to help rebuild Nir Oz.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: At the start of his statement, Mozes expressed gratitude to the thousands who protest daily to raise awareness and push for the swift return of the remaining hostages. 'I was there for 482 days and suffered. I saw firsthand the horrors our people endure,' he said. Emphasizing the urgency of their release, Mozes added: 'Every moment counts. I was freed after 482 days—by sheer luck, I made it out alive. But with each passing day, those still held are at greater risk. I suffered there, I suffered greatly—mentally and physically, facing relentless abuse.' Mozes also referenced the recent confirmations of hostages' deaths. 'Just days ago, we mourned my dear Oded, Ariel, Kfir, and Shiri. Today, we learned that Itzik, Shlomo, Ohad and Tzachi are also no longer with us.' Concluding his message, Mozes extended his support to IDF soldiers, expressed condolences to bereaved families, and wished a swift recovery to the wounded. 'These brave individuals risked their lives to save me, my fellow hostages, and our entire people,' he said. He pledged to 'join the fight for the release of every last hostage and dedicate himself to rebuilding Nir Oz, transforming it from a devastated landscape into a thriving community once again.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bycf004a5ke	2025-02-27T12:09:35-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/ryxUCUXAc1x/ryxUCUXAc1x_2_0_1279_720_0_small.jpg

IDF's Hashmonaim Brigade - first all-Haredi combat unit - is swor...	In unusual scene for military event, audience separated by gender with partition; Instead of military band music, religious songs blast from speakers Dozens of soldiers from the newly established Hashmonaim Brigade, the IDF’s first ultra-Orthodox combat unit, gathered Thursday afternoon at the Maccabees' Tombs in Modiin for the unit's inaugural swearing-in ceremony. The soldiers, who received their unit insignia earlier this week, participated in a ceremony known as a 'declaration' rather than an 'oath' to align with the religious principles of the soldiers, who avoid oaths for religious reasons. The ceremony was tailored to the lifestyle of the recruits and reflected the atmosphere the brigade strives to maintain. In an unusual scene for a military event, the audience was separated by gender with a partition. Instead of the usual military band music, speakers played religious songs performed solely by male singers. Rabbi Moshe Korkus, the brigade’s rabbi, offered his blessings to the soldiers. 'Each one of you continues the way of the Maccabees, holding in one hand a sword and shield, and in the other hand declaring, 'Who is for God, come to me.'' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The ceremony included elements that deviate from standard military protocol. One officer even led a 'Siyum Masechet,' a prayer and blessing traditionally recited after completing the study of a section of the Talmud. The soldiers studied the tractate 'Megillah' during their scheduled study times and marked their completion of it during the event. Prior to singing 'Hatikvah' (the national anthem), they also sang 'Mimkomcha Malkeinu Tofiah,' a prayer traditionally sung on Shabbat in synagogues. 'Unusual in the community, natural to the soul' Some of the soldiers participated in the ceremony without their families, who oppose their enlistment, but others shared with excitement how meaningful the ceremony was, a moment they had never experienced before. Gideon Shushan, whose son enlisted in the brigade, told Ynet: 'We are very proud of him and of all of them. We are proud of our sons studying in yeshivas, and of our sons serving in the army.' Asked if the enlistment was unusual for their community, Shushan said: 'It’s unusual in our community, but natural to our soul. Being part of the fight in a war — there is nothing more Jewish than that. We are very proud of him and of all those who support and serve.' When asked about the reactions they received to his son’s enlistment, he replied: 'The reactions in our town of Beit Shemesh have been all positive. Our rabbi supports it, and the community supports it. We all support both our sons and daughters who study in yeshivas and seminaries, and we are also proud of those who serve in the army, with God's help.' Mike, a relative of another soldier in the brigade, expressed his pride. 'Despite all the questions and criticism about the army, we are very proud of Moshe for enlisting, for completing the course, and for participating in defending the homeland,' he said. When asked if he ever thought something like this could happen two or three years ago, he responded: 'Honestly, I didn’t think this was the path he would choose in life. But he’s doing it, and in the end I think it’s a good thing.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjhq00gc9ke	2025-02-27T11:02:24-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/H1dqMxC9ke/H1dqMxC9ke_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Kazem Zawahreh, who took part in deadly shooting attack near Maale Adumim, was hospitalized in a vegetative state, said to have cost state nearly $2 million annually As part of the hostage deal, Israel overnight released Kazem Zawahreh, a Palestinian terrorist who carried out the deadly shooting attack on Highway 1 near Maale Adumim in February last year. Zawahreh, along with two other assailants, opened fire on vehicles stuck in traffic, killing Matan Malmalyah and wounding six others. He was shot in the head at the scene by armed civilians and has been in a vegetative state ever since, hospitalized under guard at Hadassah Ein Kerem Medical Center. His care reportedly cost Israel approximately 6 million shekels ($1.6 million) over the past year. Zawahreh had lost all ability to speak or move, except for minimal eye movement, and required dialysis twice a week. Security officials revealed that his monthly hospitalization expenses, including medical care and security, amounted to roughly 500,000 shekels ($135,000).

Defense officials said the decision was made in part due to the high financial burden of his continued hospitalization, which diverted resources from law enforcement and national security efforts. 'This step aims to reduce budgetary strain, especially given the complex security situation,' a security official said. Overnight, after a year in critical medical condition, Zawahreh was released and transferred to Palestinian Authority-controlled territory in a Magen David Adom intensive care ambulance as part of the deal. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skhober5yl	2025-02-27T10:55:51-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/02/22/HJ4iBtVn6/HJ4iBtVn6_0_0_959_540_0_small.jpg
Israel lifts ban on European far-right parties, cites changes in ...	Jerusalem removes sanctions on France's National Rally, Sweden Democrats and Spain's VOX; maintains restrictions on Germany's AfD and Austria's Freedom Party Israel has decided to lift its diplomatic ban on three far-right European political parties, including France's National Rally, Sweden's Sweden Democrats, and Spain's VOX, while maintaining its embargo on Austria's Freedom Party and Germany's Alternative for Germany (AfD), which secured strong results in recent elections. Foreign Minister Eli Cohen directed his office and Israeli embassies in France, Sweden and Spain to engage with these far-right parties, noting that the move was based on a thorough review of their positions on Israel, antisemitism and Holocaust denial. 'We are examining how these parties behave today,' Cohen said in a meeting with Jewish community leaders and pro-Israel organizations in Belgium. 'We do not want to isolate ourselves from potential allies in Europe, but we also do not want to legitimize neo-Nazi movements.' Cohen emphasized that Israel's decision-making process involves a detailed assessment of each party's stance on critical issues such as antisemitism, support for Israel, and their position on Jewish traditions like circumcision and kosher slaughter. He also pointed out that some of these parties have problematic historical roots, but Israel is focusing on their current actions and whether they are distancing themselves from any antisemitic rhetoric. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Regarding the continued ban on the AfD and Austria's Freedom Party, Israeli officials explained that it was not a random decision but based on specific criteria. They stated that, while Israel has traditionally viewed these parties with skepticism, they are closely monitoring whether they are taking effective measures to distance themselves from antisemitic elements. 'It’s about updating and reassessing based on their actions,' one senior official said. While the Sweden Democrats have Nazi roots, Israeli officials acknowledged that the party has evolved, with changes in both its leadership's rhetoric and internal policies. In contrast, the AfD and the Freedom Party's efforts to distance themselves from problematic elements regarding antisemitism have been deemed insufficient, officials said. 'We want to see how they treat Jewish life and Israel, and we will make our decisions accordingly,' the official added. Israeli officials also stressed the importance of dialogue with Jewish community leaders in these countries, ensuring that decisions regarding the relationship with these parties will be based on real-time developments rather than historical precedents. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1fwlxa9yx	2025-02-27T10:52:41-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2017/04/25/7739392/7739392_0_150_1300_732_0_small.jpg
This is how Hamas’ deception led to Israel’s October 7 intelligen...	IDF investigation uncovers how Hamas’ strategic deception and Israeli intelligence failures paved the way for the devastating October 7 attack; report highlights systemic gaps, missed warnings and a false sense of security that left Israel unprepared The IDF's investigation into the failures surrounding a devastating Hamas attack over a year ago, published on Thursday, revealed systemic intelligence lapses and strategic deception by the terror group. The report, part of the IDF’s core reviews, highlights that former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar believed success hinged on total surprise, a strategy solidified after he and his officials, Marwan Issa and Mohammed Deif, consolidated control over Gaza in early 2017. Despite severe shortcomings, no personal accountability has been enforced, with responsibility for dismissals deferred to incoming Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir. The investigation found that Hamas’ strategic deception intensified in the years leading up to the attack. While publicly seeking a cease-fire, Hamas secretly prepared to breach the IDF's Gaza Division. Military intelligence failed to recognize this dual strategy. Hamas also established a general headquarters for the first time after the 2014 Operation Protective Edge, with Raad Saad developing the 'Jericho Wall' invasion plan in response to Israel’s underground border barrier construction. The plan, which reached Israeli intelligence in 2018, was dismissed as unrealistic. By 2019, Hamas had formed elite Nukhba battalions, with reserves completed that year. Intelligence gathered during operations last year revealed that the invasion plan, dating back to 2017, included live broadcasts from captured kibbutzim, symbolic siege of strategic sites and aims to reach cities like Be’er Sheva and Ashkelon. The plan initially targeted the murder of 600 civilians in Ofakim; 33 were murdered there on October 7. The COVID-19 pandemic delayed the plan for two years, as Hamas diverted resources to pandemic management, further lulling Israel into complacency. Intelligence failures were compounded by missed warning signs, including a Hamas-produced TV series, 'The Free Fist,' which depicted scenes eerily similar to the October 7 attack. 'Hamas knew they were 85% operationally ready by the end of 2022,' the investigation revealed. 'We later learned that Hamas saw 2022 as the year of great opportunities.' Sinwar’s strategic decision to withdraw most Hamas forces to southern Gaza preserved the terror group’s military wing and weapons stockpiles, anticipating Israel’s overwhelming response. The move proved successful, with Hamas recovering to over 10,000 terrorists by October 6, 2023. In the month before the attack, Hamas revived border protests as a deception tactic, while the 24 hours preceding the invasion saw complete quiet, and was not flagged by intelligence as suspicious. The investigation concluded that the core failure lay in the growing gap between perceived and actual realities. 'The Military Intelligence Directorate (MID) did not help decision-makers realize that their approach was wrong,' the report read. 'It was a classic intelligence failure, the kind books were written about after Pearl Harbor, Barbarossa and Yom Kippur.' The Research Division’s flawed methods and organizational culture created biases, with a false sense of superiority and transparency over the enemy. 'Israel saw Hamas as a pragmatic movement with whom it could do business,' the report noted. 'The MID underestimated Hamas, focusing more on its rocket system.' The investigation criticized the lack of skepticism within the MID, which sought explanations to fit prevailing narratives rather than challenging them. 'An illusion of certainty was created,' the report stated. 'A false sense of intelligence superiority.' The report also highlighted gaps in understanding Hamas’ culture and language, crucial for research professionalism. 'They preferred harmony and synchronization within the MID, without debates,' it noted. 'The research approach argued that there is a need to distinguish between the enemy's capabilities and its intentions.' The investigation called for broad systemic changes within the MID, beyond replacing senior officials or establishing new units. Maj. Gen. Shlomi Binder, the MID’s new chief, has adopted recommendations to revise warning models and expand intelligence-gathering units. 'The corrections will not take place through replacing one senior official,' the report warned. 'A broad change is needed within the MID.' Binder concluded that the IDF’s intelligence system exacerbated biases and professional gaps, with no adequate military research on Hamas despite its classification as a military force. 'The deep understanding of the enemy eroded,' he said, 'and the mistakes were rooted in perceptions — one of the oldest mistakes made in intelligence.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkd8rnrqkl	2025-02-27T10:34:28-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/H1j1r1C9ke/H1j1r1C9ke_4_0_852_479_0_small.jpg

President Donald Trump said Thursday he is confident that Russian leader Vladimir Putin will 'keep his word' if an agreement is reached to end Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Trump said going through the 'Russia hoax' ordeal gives him confidence that he can trust Putin in talks about the war in Ukraine that the Kremlin launched three year ago. Early in Trump's first term as president, the Republican was dogged by a special counsel-led investigation looking into the FBI's probe of Russian interference in his 2016 campaign for the White House. Trump made the comments during an exchange with reporters at the start of his meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Heroism of murdered hostage Ori Danino revealed by fellow captive...	Rabbi Elchanan Danino, father of killed hostage Ori Danino, talks about his son’s extraordinary bravery during his captivity with Hamas told to him by ex-hostage Eliya Cohen Rabbi Elchanan Danino, father of hostage Ori Danino, who was murdered in a Hamas tunnel in Gaza, spoke with former hostage Eliya Cohen and learned remarkable details about his son’s bravery. According to Cohen, who was held captive alongside him, Ori fought his kidnappers on October 7 and worked to help his fellow hostages. In an interview with Ynet, Danino shared what he learned from Cohen. 'He told us that Ori got out of the car and hid in a bush. When a terrorist grabbed him, he punched him so hard that he was badly injured. Even inside the vehicle, during the abduction, Ori fought the terrorists hand-to-hand,' his father said. According to Danino, the terrorist was so injured that he was unable to identify who had hurt him, even 50 days later. 'They searched for the one who hit and wounded the terrorist for 50 days in the tunnels,' he said. Cohen also told him that, while in captivity, Ori 'didn’t even acknowledge the terrorists’ weapons' and focused on helping his wounded comrades. 'He didn’t care that they were armed. They only gave Hersh (Goldberg-Polin) medical treatment because of him after three days.' Danino described his son as fearless. 'He was a soldier and we always knew Ori had no fear. Eliya told us that Ori told him: ‘I’m not sure I’ll make it out.’ He was completely mission-driven. Ori told me: ‘Dad, if there’s a war, I’ll be the first to fight.’ In the end, he helped save three hostages — Omer Shem Tov, Mia and Itay Regev.' Despite always knowing his son was courageous, Danino admitted: 'I would have run away in that situation. Ori’s siblings constantly say that, even today, he wouldn’t have acted any differently. One of his former girlfriends called me today and said that‘Ori always told me his greatest honor would be to die for his country.’' Ori enlisted in the Givati Brigade’s ultra-Orthodox battalion in 2018 and was later recruited into its elite reconnaissance unit. At one point, he was transferred to the 202nd Battalion under the command of Lt. Almog Rotem, to whom he remained closely attached.

It’s an honor and a source of comfort. But it’s a deep wound for his siblings. Their big brother is suddenly gone — it’s not easy.' According to Cohen, Ori never left Hersh’s side in captivity. 'He was a unifying force in the tunnels. He refused to eat meat or chicken there and recited the Jewish prayer for meals loud at every meal. 'He seemed to know exactly what he was doing at every moment. His awareness in life was incredible. His love for others wasn’t new to us — he always helped the elderly and the poor. He would help complete strangers.' Danino stressed that Ori was one of many heroes: 'Let’s not forget — there are hundreds, even thousands of heroes in this story. We thought this generation was ‘only about technology,’ but they have incredible strength — like Aner Shapira. Which of us adults would do something like that?' Shapiro threw back at Hamas terrorists seven grenades thrown into the shelter near the Nova festival that has been come to be known as the 'shelter of death,' saving many lives. 'This is what our leaders should be learning,' he added. 'Aner and Ori did it without being ordered to — they risked and sacrificed themselves. There’s no shortage of heroes in this war. The gap between the leadership and the soldiers who gave everything is enormous. At the very least, our leaders should strive to be like them, but instead, it seems like they go out of their way not to be.' Ori Danino was executed by Hamas terrorists in late August, along with hostages Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Carmel Gat. At the time, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari stated: 'They were kidnapped on October 7 and murdered by Hamas terrorists shortly before we reached them.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk2tfx05kl	2025-02-27T09:59:47-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/HJyDWJRckl/HJyDWJRckl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

IDF October 7 Investigation finds Hamas exploited intelligence ga...	Military releases investigation into the failures leading up to and during the October 7 Hamas attack, says surprise and operational collapse on October 7 were more severe than those of the 1973 Yom Kippur War; no senior officials have been dismissed and calls for an independent inquiry remain blocked For the first time since October 7, and after months of delays, the IDF on Thursday released its core investigations into Hamas' attack — while a state commission of inquiry remains nowhere in sight. Despite the grave failures uncovered, the investigation does not assign personal responsibility to any individual, leaving disciplinary actions and dismissals to outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi’s successor, Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir. Total surprise The IDF’s October 7 investigative conclusions, while largely unsurprising, paint a grim picture. One key finding highlights the extent of the army’s intelligence failure: the surprise and operational collapse on October 7 were more severe than those of the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Unlike in 1973, when Israel had prior warnings of a possible Arab attack, debated whether to call up reserves and saw signals of impending war, no such indications were identified this time. 'There was no one who saw or detected any sign of this event in advance, not even at the lowest intelligence level,' one of the central investigations found. 'The surprise was total — situational and fundamental — against a strategic deception that lasted years, an operational deception leading up to the attack and a tactical deception throughout the night before the invasion.' No discussion was ever held about calling up reserves. The military acknowledged that Hamas successfully employed deception at multiple levels, leading Israel into a deadly trap, including by manipulating its 'Jericho Wall' defense concept — a dossier detailing a possible Hamas attack against Israel. Investigative reports also confirm a that, in a classified General Staff meeting on July 27, 2022, then-Operations Division head Brig. Gen. Yaron Finkelman — who was the IDF’s Southern Command chief on October 7 — ordered preparations for war with Hamas based on the 'Jericho Wall' plans. However, no action was taken. Deception and missed warnings During that 2022 discussion, Finkelman concluded that Hamas could only achieve surprise through a deception operation disguised as a military drill or by misinterpreting its own heightened readiness as an Israeli threat. In a report from November 2023, investigative journalist Ronen Bergman reported that Finkelman himself fell victim to the very deception tactics he had warned about in the early hours of October 7. In a phone assessment at 3:00 a.m. that day, he repeated the same two mistaken assumptions regarding Hamas’ increased alert level. Hamas initially planned to launch its invasion during the Jewish High Holidays in 2022 and again on Passover in 2023, while the IDF chief was stationed at the Kissufim base for the night — unaware of the plans. Hamas ultimately postponed the attack to improve its elite Nukhba forces' readiness. Halevi first heard about the 'Jericho Wall' report only two weeks after the war began, despite having served in key intelligence and operational roles — including as Military Intelligence Directorate chief, Southern Command chief and deputy chief of staff — over the past decade. The investigation also suggests that Hezbollah refrained from joining the war due to a misunderstanding in its coordination with Hamas in July 2023. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Failures in intelligence and defense strategy Halevi insisted on launching IDF probes at the start of the war despite opposition from some military leaders, who feared it would lead to finger-pointing while soldiers were still fighting in Gaza. Delays caused by the war’s expansion to Lebanon, Iran and Yemen, as well as political disputes over responsibility, slowed the process. Now, the military has concluded 18 General Staff-level investigations. Four core reports have been presented to the public, focusing on Israel’s flawed perception of Hamas before October 7, intelligence failures at all levels — particularly the lack of strategic and tactical warnings — the critical hours leading up to the attack and the collapse of the IDF’s Gaza Division. According to the findings, Israel’s long-standing policy of differentiating between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority strengthened the terrorist organization, including through the flow of Qatari cash into Gaza and humanitarian concessions. Israel chose a 'conflict management' approach that sought to maintain the status quo, based on the mistaken belief that Hamas neither wanted nor was preparing for a large-scale war. This assumption was built on deterrence and cease-fire agreements, but Hamas used deception tactics to reinforce it. 'In hindsight, this was a grave mistake,' the report read. The threat of a surprise large-scale attack was not considered a plausible scenario, as intelligence assessments assumed Hamas would not launch a war without warning. The underlying belief was that Israel held military superiority, Hamas was a secondary threat and Military Intelligence 'knew everything.' Operational collapse on October 7 The massive above- and below-ground border defenses Israel built along Gaza created a false sense of security, forcing Hamas to develop alternative invasion tactics that bypassed tunnels. Confidence in the border barrier led to a reduction in troop deployment along the border. The investigation found that on October 7 the IDF’s conflict-management strategy collapsed, as did the assumption that enemy attacks could be contained along the border fence. 'The concept was deeply entrenched — there was no systematic effort to challenge it,' the report read. Before the war, IDF Southern Command assessed that the worst-case scenario would be an infiltration of about 70 terrorists from two locations. In reality, around 5,000 terrorists breached the border, murdering more than 1,160 people in a single day. Three months before the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the military to shift its focus to Iran, Hezbollah and the West Bank while de-escalating the Gaza front. Decision-making failures at the highest levels Despite at least 10 warning signs in the two years before the war, IDF intelligence failed to reassess its assumptions. 'We read the signals but we didn’t see what they actually said. There was a false sense of security,' IDF officials admitted. However, the investigation did not find evidence of negligence or dereliction of duty among intelligence officers. The intelligence division lacked a critical approach, failing to challenge its own assumptions. Analysts focused on Hamas’ intentions rather than its capabilities and lacked sufficient understanding of radical Islam. Military Intelligence officers also showed long-standing organizational failures in questioning strategic assessments, even after October 7. Two officers were deemed unfit for their roles. Hamas, the investigation found, had been systematically preparing for war since 2016. The 2021 Gaza conflict bolstered its confidence, reinforcing its belief that Israel was weak and that total 'liberation' was achievable. By July 2023, Hamas had developed an integrated war plan, coordinated with Hezbollah and Iran, aimed at Israel’s destruction. Failures in military response Although signs of an imminent attack were present the night before October 7 — such as increased rocket launch indications and Hamas militants disappearing into tunnels — these were not recognized as serious warnings. Intelligence was passed via WhatsApp messages from the Shin Bet to IDF intelligence but was not properly escalated. In the crucial early hours of October 7, IDF forces remained in routine security positions, with no reinforcement of troops. The Gaza Division collapsed within hours, but this was not immediately understood by military leaders, delaying an effective response. The failure to comprehend the scale of the attack in real-time resulted in critical decision-making gaps. The Israeli Air Force was also unprepared for an invasion of this scale. While its forces were on routine alert, it had no contingency plan for repelling a massive ground assault. Despite numerous intelligence and operational failures, no senior officers have been dismissed. Calls for external investigations blocked Despite demands from IDF leaders, political figures and the Israeli public, Netanyahu has blocked efforts to establish an independent state commission of inquiry into the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust. Unlike past wars, no external military investigation has been authorized, apart from a partial review by Israel’s state comptroller. Some senior officers consulted lawyers before giving testimony to investigators. Halevi himself chose not to do so and was reportedly disappointed to see legal influence in some officers' responses. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s100p00zr9yl	2025-02-27T08:40:13-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/S1uHq565Je/S1uHq565Je_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Cyprus failed to probe British teen’s claim she was gang-raped by...	ECHR admonishes Cypriot authorities for failing to determine whether woman — 18 at time of alleged rape — had ever consented to having sex with some of the suspects Cyprus’ law enforcement authorities failed to live up to their obligation to thoroughly and effectively investigate a British teenager’s claims that she had been gang-raped by a group of Israelis while on a 2019 vacation in a popular resort town, the European Court of Human Rights ruled Thursday. In its ruling, the court placed particular weight on the failure of the authorities to determine whether the woman — who was 18 at the time of the alleged rape — had ever consented to having sex with some of the suspects. According to the ruling, the woman had told authorities she rejected the suggestion of having sex with multiple partners. However, the suspects persisted in entering the hotel room where the alleged rape took place, disregarding her pleas for them to leave. Even though the woman was having sex with an Israeli friend of the suspects in that hotel room at the time, the court said investigators didn’t establish whether the suspects had secured her consent. According to testimony, some of them only assumed they would because of her previous behavior. Flaws in the investigation The court said investigators appeared not to take into account the woman’s capacity to consent in light of testimony that she had consumed alcohol prior to the alleged rape and that traces of cocaine were found in her urine. Moreover, police and investigators took the suspects’ statements that no rape had taken place 'at face value' despite testimony that her Israeli partner 'said he would arrange for his friends to have sex' with her. This compounded what the court described as a series of flaws in the initial state of the investigation, from a limited search of physical evidence such as fingerprints in the hotel room to failure to track down potential suspects or witnesses. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The court observes that the present case reveals certain biases concerning women in Cyprus which impeded the effective protection of the applicant’s rights as a victim of gender-based violence and which, if not reversed, run the risk of creating a background of impunity, discouraging victims’ trust in the criminal justice system, despite the existence of a satisfactory legislative framework,' the ruling said. No legal representation and prejudiced proceedings The July 2019 case made headlines in Cyprus, Britain and Israel when all 12 suspects were released without charge after the woman retracted her rape claims. The Cyprus attorney-general opted not to pursue legal proceedings against the suspects, while the woman was subsequently found guilty on a charge of public mischief and sentenced to a four-month suspended jail term. In the lower court ruling, the judge said the woman didn’t tell the truth and tried to deceive the court with 'evasive' statements. He said the woman had admitted to investigators that she made up the claims because she was 'ashamed' after finding out that some of the Israelis had videoed her having consensual sex with her Israeli boyfriend on their cellphones. In 2022, the Cyprus Supreme Court overturned the woman’s conviction, citing among other reasons that she didn’t have a lawyer present when police repeatedly questioned her and that the lower court misconstrued evidence, prejudicing proceedings against her. The ECHR ruling said that, given the conditions of the woman’s questioning by police, 'there is force in her argument' that the 'long and repeated interviews' prompted her to retract her rape allegations. The court awarded the woman 20,000 euros ($20,850) in damages and another 5,000 euros ($5,210) for legal costs. Justice Abroad Director Michael Polak, who represented the woman both in Cyprus and at the ECHR, called the ruling a 'landmark decision for victims of sexual violence.' 'This ruling reinforces the fundamental principle that allegations of sexual violence must be investigated thoroughly and fairly, without institutional obstruction,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjh5c11ac1e	2025-02-27T08:16:15-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/05/SJ1ohz3eT/SJ1ohz3eT_0_228_2955_1664_0_small.jpg

ICC prosecutor's office says Palestinian probe continues with urg...	The International Criminal Court will urgently continue its investigation into crimes committed in Palestinian territories, or by Palestinians, the prosecutor's office said on Thursday, despite the withdrawal of an arrest warrant for a Hamas leader. The ICC said on Wednesday that judges had withdrawn an arrest warrant for Ibrahim al-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, following credible reports of his death. Deif had been wanted for atrocities committed during Hamas' October 2023 attack on southern Israeli communities that triggered the war in Gaza. He had been accused by prosecutors of mass killing, rape and hostage taking. He was killed in an Israeli airstrike last year, but militant group Hamas only confirmed his death in late January. On Thursday, the prosecutor's office said the probe continued and it would not hesitate to seek arrest warrants for other suspects 'if and when it considers that the threshold of a realistic prospect of conviction has been met'. 'Addressing the situation as an urgent priority, the office is conducting an active investigation, and advances multiple and interconnected additional lines of inquiry,' it said in an e-mail.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryn0hecckg	2025-02-27T05:55:56-08:00

A delegation of Turkey's pro-Kurdish DEM Party visited Ocalan on Thursday in his island prison and later delivered his statement in nearby Istanbul. 'I am making a call for the laying down of arms, and I take on the historical responsibility of this call,' Ocalan said in a letter made public by DEM party members.

Defense minister warns terror group using cease-fire to rebuild forces, relocate operatives and stockpile weapons; reveals Hamas had planned attacks in West Bank before October 7 Defense Minister Israel Katz said Thursday that intelligence gathered during the cease-fire indicated Hamas was planning attacks on soldiers and communities. His remarks followed reports that Hamas had relocated thousands of operatives from southern to northern Gaza, rebuilding its battalions, tunnels, rocket stockpiles and drone capabilities. Katz stressed that the cease-fire was not due to a lack of munitions or troop exhaustion but solely to facilitate the return of hostages. 'This is our top priority, our duty and our mutual responsibility,' he said at a conference of regional council leaders. He emphasized that Israel was maintaining a buffer zone in Gaza, including military outposts beyond Israeli lines, and would not permit arms smuggling through humanitarian aid. 'If we had withdrawn from the Philadelphi Corridor, within these 42 days, it would have been flooded with weapons,' he warned. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: With the first phase of the hostage deal completed—returning 25 living hostages and eight deceased—Katz said continued pressure was necessary to compel Hamas to release the remaining captives. 'The best way forward is for Hamas to know that the IDF is ready to resume combat,' he said, reiterating that 'Hamas will not remain in control of Gaza, militarily or politically.' Katz also discussed efforts to facilitate voluntary emigration from Gaza. 'I am rapidly advancing a voluntary migration initiative, enabling those who wish to leave Gaza to do so via Ashdod Port and Ramon Airport,' he said. Addressing threats in the West Bank, Katz revealed that Hamas had planned attacks there before October 7 and that Iranian-backed weapons and funding had fueled growing terrorist activity. 'The refugee camps are the core of terrorism in the West Bank,' he said, instructing the IDF to continue operations in Jenin, Tulkarm and Nur Shams to dismantle terrorist infrastructure. Regarding Israel's northern border, Katz said that Israeli forces would remain in strategic outposts in Lebanon indefinitely, with U.S. approval. He also reaffirmed that Israel would maintain its military presence in the buffer zone along the Syrian border indefinitely, citing security concerns. 'It was clear to me and the prime minister that we needed to secure the buffer zone, and our policy is to remain there—at the peak of Mount Hermon and other strategic positions—for an unlimited period,' he said. Addressing Syria's new Islamist leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former al-Qaeda and ISIS member, Katz dismissed him as unreliable. 'He swapped his robes for suits and speaks well, but we do not trust him—we trust only the IDF,' he said. Katz reiterated Israel’s demand for the demilitarization of southern Syria and confirmed that the IDF struck Syrian regime positions earlier in the week. 'Two days ago, we hit the first attempt by the new regime to man positions and outposts,' he said. 'We will not allow violations of the demilitarization agreement in southern Syria, nor will we permit the emergence of new threats in the area.' Katz concluded by emphasizing a broader security doctrine: 'Israel cannot allow extremist organizations to operate along its borders—whether in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria or the West Bank. This is our policy, and we will enforce it.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byxxhppqje	2025-02-27T02:55:35-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/22/Hyj118gP5kg/Hyj118gP5kg_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

No Israeli withdrawal from Gaza’s Philadelphi Corridor, official ...	Israeli forces to remain in Gaza-Egypt border buffer zone despite hostage deal terms, citing Hamas rearmament and border security concerns; with 59 hostages still held, talks for next phase remain uncertain as Hamas demands full Israeli pullout and end to war Israel will not withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor—a buffer zone along the Gaza-Egypt border—on the 42nd day of the hostage deal, despite the agreement brokered by Qatar and Egypt stipulating that the IDF would begin pulling out, an Israeli official said Thursday. 'We will not allow Hamas terrorists to once again roam our borders with trucks and rifles, nor will we let them rearm through smuggling,' the official stated. The announcement came as the first phase of the agreement was completed, with the release of 33 hostages—including eight who were returned deceased. Fifty-nine hostages remain in Hamas captivity in Gaza after 510 days. On Thursday morning, Hamas spokesman Abdel Latif al-Qanua said the group was willing to extend the first phase of the deal or merge it with the second phase, 'in accordance with our red lines.' He specified that these conditions included a full Israeli withdrawal, an end to the war and reconstruction efforts in Gaza. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: With the return of the four deceased hostages to Israel, the first phase of the deal has officially concluded. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to hold consultations Thursday on the next steps and discuss whether to send a negotiating delegation for the second phase of talks. Netanyahu previously committed that if a delegation were dispatched, the Cabinet would first hold a debate on its mandate, but such a discussion has yet to take place. Instead, deliberations have shifted to Hamas’ alleged violations of the agreement, which Netanyahu cited in his decision to halt the release of additional Palestinian prisoners. It remains unclear when and where negotiations for the second phase will begin, though estimates suggest they may take place next week in Cairo or Doha. U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is scheduled to visit the region early next week, including a stop in Israel, with expectations that his visit will help jumpstart discussions on the next stage of the deal. The IDF was initially expected to begin its withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor on Saturday, with a full exit completed by March 9. However, the Israeli official’s remarks confirm that the pullout will not happen. Throughout the first phase of the agreement, the Philadelphi Corridor—considered a key element of the deal—was a subject of extensive debate. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich had listed Israel’s presence there as one of his 'red lines' for Netanyahu, threatening to collapse the government in the case of an Israeli withdrawal from the 8.7-mile stretch of land. Some analysts had suspected Israel never intended to withdraw and that the move was tied to the second phase of the deal, which remains highly uncertain. A security official acknowledged Wednesday that the Philadelphi Corridor was a 'complex issue' and that 'there is significant uncertainty surrounding the expected withdrawal.' The most immediate consequence of Israel remaining in the corridor is that negotiations for the second phase of the hostage release deal are unlikely to progress. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1ehuaa91x	2025-02-27T02:22:36-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/01/ryfoOKZ97yx/ryfoOKZ97yx_0_107_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Petah Tikva man charged with spying for Iran	Daniel Kitov, 26, charged with contacting foreign agent and receiving payment for tasks, including spraying graffiti and photographing military sites and the Shin Bet director's home for money The Shin Bet and Israel Police reported Thursday that an indictment was filed against Daniel Kitov, 26, from Petah Tikva, for spying and carrying out tasks on behalf of Iran. According to the statement, Kitov was instructed to photograph the home of Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar and suggested photographing the home of National Unity party leader Benny Gantz. The statement noted that Kitov was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of carrying out various tasks on behalf of a hostile foreign entity. A Shin Bet investigation, conducted alongside the Tel Aviv District Police’s Central Unit, found that Kitov had been in contact with an Iranian operative for months, carrying out dozens of acts of graffiti vandalism in Petah Tikva and Rosh Ha’ayin in exchange for payment. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In one of the messages Kitov received, he was instructed: 'Make it big, nice, good, and high quality.' Another message read: 'We have tasks like burning Netanyahu’s picture and filming it.' Kitov responded, 'I can only do graffiti. What should I write? And how much do you pay?' The agent replied: 'Graffiti—$40. Posting flyers—$2 per flyer. Burning Netanyahu’s picture—$50. You need to write ‘Bibi is a dictator.’' The investigation found that Kitov was instructed to photograph the home of Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar and several military bases. He was also asked if he knew any Israeli Air Force pilots. While he did not complete these tasks, he independently offered to photograph the home of MK Gantz, though that, too, was never carried out. Authorities determined that Kitov was aware he had been in contact with an Iranian handler, partly based on media reports and his own online searches on the topic. The indictment, filed in the Lod District Court, charges him with contact with a foreign agent. The graffiti Kitov sprayed included the phrases 'Conquerors of Khaybar' and 'Children of Ruhollah.' The term 'Ruhollah' is commonly associated with religious and nationalist figures in Shiite Islam, while 'Conquerors of Khaybar' has been used in anti-Jewish contexts, primarily by Islamist groups. Kitov was caught in the act, and investigators found he had received $7,000 for his activities. The Iranian agents he communicated with used the aliases 'Mike' and 'Roni Bar.' The Shin Bet and police warned that 'intelligence and terrorist elements continue their efforts to recruit Israelis for security and terrorist missions within Israel. These actors attempt to recruit Israelis through social media, and we caution citizens and residents of Israel against engaging with foreign agents or carrying out missions on their behalf.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk4qx2ackl	2025-02-27T01:37:27-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/BJG6u5pcyx/BJG6u5pcyx_0_130_1170_659_0_small.jpg

Israel-Hamas cease-fire talks: interim deal, renewed fighting or ...	Israel readies a delegation for hostage deal talks, but Trump envoy warns of Middle East volatility; Hamas demands a higher price for additional hostage releases without ending the war, while uncertainty looms over the Philadelphi Corridor withdrawal deadline Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has yet to decide how to proceed with the hostage deal, as the first phase has concluded. The proposed framework includes two additional phases: a second phase involving a permanent cease-fire, the release of all remaining living hostages and the full withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza—where it currently remains only in the buffer zone and along the Philadelphi Corridor. The third phase entails long-term reconstruction of Gaza, during which the remains of fallen hostages would also be returned. Negotiations on the terms of the second phase were supposed to begin on the 16th day of the cease-fire—February 4—but have yet to start officially. However, talks are ongoing with the mediation of Qatar, Egypt and Trump's regional envoy, Steve Witkoff. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, who is in the U.S. and was appointed by Netanyahu to lead the negotiations instead of the heads of the Mossad and Shin Bet, has been in discussions with Witkoff over the past week. Israel is preparing to send a delegation to discuss the next steps, but it has yet to be determined whether talks will be held in Cairo or Doha. Israel is also waiting for Witkoff’s visit, which was postponed this week. Sources in Israel were informed that he plans to arrive next week, but he made it clear that his visit will depend on progress in the negotiations. Possible scenarios and the Philadelphi Corridor hurdle 'If negotiations progress positively enough—this is an initial stage where we set certain boundaries, outline what we want to discuss, and define the outcomes we expect… if everything goes well, I might be able to arrive on Sunday to finalize and implement the agreement,' Witkoff said at an American Jewish Committee conference. He expressed optimism but remained cautious: 'We've had many discussions and people are listening—but that doesn’t mean it will happen. The Middle East is a very chaotic place.' Israel now stands at a crossroads with three main options: resuming hostilities, moving to Phase II or extending Phase I with additional hostage releases. Decision-makers in Jerusalem favor extending Phase I, which could also temporarily defuse political obstacles for Netanyahu, particularly the threat from Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich to quit the coalition if the war ends. A security official described this scenario as an 'interim deal' that could lead to the release of additional hostages. 'We will try to prolong the cease-fire. Hamas does not want the fighting to resume—it is not in their interest,' he said. Under this scenario, Israel is expected to demand the release of captive fathers still in Hamas' hands, as well as hostages believed to be wounded or ill based on information from captivity survivors. Witkoff hinted at this possibility, saying that advancing Phase II alongside the 'release of additional hostages' is a 'real option.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamas has not ruled out extending Phase I but has signaled that it will demand a higher price for each hostage—requiring new negotiations over prisoner-to-hostage release ratios. Senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk, in an interview this week, expressed regret over the October 7 massacre due to the devastation it has brought upon Gaza. Speaking to The New York Times, he said that if Phase I is extended, Hamas will demand significantly more prisoners in exchange for each hostage—500 to 1,000 terrorists per hostage—viewing all remaining captives as soldiers. Israel also anticipates that Hamas will seek an increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza. A further complication in this scenario is a clause in the current agreement requiring Israel to begin withdrawing from the Philadelphi Corridor by this Saturday—the 42nd day of the cease-fire—and to complete the withdrawal by day 50. This is one of the 'red lines' Smotrich has set for Netanyahu. Some believe Israel has no intention of pulling out of Philadelphi, as the withdrawal constitutes part of Phase II, which is unlikely to be agreed upon. The security official addressing the matter called it a 'complex issue' and noted 'significant uncertainty regarding the expected withdrawal.' The second option: Progressing to Phase II Moving to Phase II appears highly unlikely at this stage. Israel insists on achieving all of its war objectives, including dismantling Hamas' military and governing capabilities. Israeli officials have made it clear that in any negotiations for Phase II, Hamas would be required to disarm, demilitarize Gaza entirely and exile its leadership—following the Beirut 1982 model whereby Israel exiled the leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization to Tunisia following its invasion of Lebanon. 'If Hamas agrees—great, the war can end,' an Israeli official said. However, the likelihood of Hamas accepting these terms is extremely low. The group has signaled a willingness—at least on paper—to relinquish control over the future governance of Gaza. However, Israel has made clear that it will not tolerate Hamas ruling from behind the scenes in a 'Hezbollah model' akin to southern Lebanon. If Hamas refuses, and Phase I is not extended, the only remaining option is resuming military operations. 'If Hamas refuses, Israel will achieve its objectives through intense fighting,' the security official asserted. 'This will be combat under a new chief of staff, with weapons and munitions received after the lifting of arms embargoes and with unprecedented U.S. support—which also wants to see Hamas destroyed. The fighting will be intense, and we will eliminate Hamas’ military and governing capabilities, including how humanitarian aid is handled. What was before will not be what happens now. The fighting will be different and so will the humanitarian aspect.' A senior Israeli official added: 'Hamas will have to choose between three options—Phase II under Israeli terms, extending Phase I with additional hostage releases or a return to war.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1hfpq69kg	2025-02-27T01:07:39-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/24/Hyy8hLc5kx/Hyy8hLc5kx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
What is the key to bringing Israeli families back to the peripher...	Tal Basechess says the gap between Israel’s periphery and its center has widened over the past 16 months of war The gap between Israel’s periphery and its center has widened over the past 16 months of war, according to Tal Basechess, CEO of the Israel Association of Community Centers. To help people successfully return to their homes, several new programs are being implemented through the Community Centers in collaboration with the government and philanthropists. For example, additional support is now available for students who need extra help transitioning back to school. Instead of just checking in upon their return, the centers will now provide ongoing online support to ensure students succeed.

20 years after Jews left Gush Katif, will they return to Gaza?	For 77 years, Israel has sought peace with the Palestinians through withdrawals and removals, but each attempt has led to more conflict In 2005, Israel forcibly evacuated around 10,000 residents from Gush Katif in the Gaza Strip. The hope? Peace. Many believed that withdrawing from Gaza would pave the way for harmony with the Palestinians and, perhaps, even lay the foundation for a future Palestinian state. Instead, Israel was met with relentless rocket fire, terror attacks, and, ultimately, the October 7 massacre—where Gazan terrorists and civilians brutally murdered 1,200 Jews. Now, U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed a plan that could allow Jews to return to Gaza. Other proposals from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and regional players are also emerging. Many doubt Trump’s vision will materialize, but one thing is clear: former Gush Katif residents say that Israel cannot return to the status quo. 'Ever since Donald Trump announced his plan, I can’t get it out of my mind,' Dror Vanunu, who served as Gush Katif’s spokesperson during the 2005 disengagement, said. Standing outside the Gush Katif Heritage Center in Nitzan, Vanunu’s eyes were distant, lost in memory. He recalled how, in 2005, thousands of journalists from around the world descended upon Gush Katif. At the time, there was an illusion, he said—that expelling Jews from the 21 flourishing communities would bring peace, that Gaza would become another Singapore, that its shores would rival the French Riviera, and that 'everything would be awesome.' 'They believed this was just a conflict over territory,' Vanunu said. 'They thought that if the Israelis left everything we built over 35 years, there would be peace. But we knew that once you take us out of Gush Katif, there would be much more terrorism. We used to say Gush Katif was like the pin in the dam of terrorism. Once you pull it out, there will be massive terrorism.' Two years after Israel’s withdrawal, under pressure from the U.S. administration, the Palestinians held elections. The people voted Hamas into power. Within months, the newly elected leadership was throwing its Fatah rivals off rooftops and further radicalizing the enclave. In the years that followed, conflict after conflict erupted—major clashes in 2014 and 2021—culminating in the Hamas-led massacre of 2023. Instead of expelling the terrorists, they expelled the victims of terror.

'Instead of expelling the terrorists, they expelled the victims of terror.' Vanunu sees Trump’s proposal as the answer. Because what you have is, instead of punishing the victims, you need to punish the terrorists. The only solution is destruction and rebuilding it again—this time, in a different way. It’s a brave solution. 'Because what you have is, instead of punishing the victims, you need to punish the terrorists,' he said. Gaza, he argued, is like biblical Sodom, with its vast underground terror tunnels. 'The only solution is destruction and rebuilding it again—this time, in a different way. It’s a brave solution.' Building a dream For 19 years, Laurence Beziz called Gush Katif home. An immigrant from France who also lived in Los Angeles, she saw her life there as part of something greater—a pioneering effort to build the state of Israel. She and her husband arrived with nothing. Together, they built one of Israel’s most successful farms. 'Life was less about what you wanted for yourself and more about what you wanted for the community,' Beziz recently recalled. 'You looked at yourself as part of something larger. It was not about how much furniture you had or what your house was like, but what you could do for the country,' she said. During those years, she and her husband were young, energetic, and driven by dreams. 'We had a lot of dreams, and basically, I can say that all of them came true,' Beziz said. When former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon first spoke of the disengagement, the Jewish residents of Gush Katif couldn’t believe it. The government had invested heavily in schools, infrastructure, and services, and the communities were thriving. 'It seemed impossible to destroy all of it,' Beziz said. Moreover, the government was unprepared. Beziz recalled the chaos of August 15, 2005—the first and central day of the disengagement. 'There was a lot of chaos. A lot of people leaving, some refusing to leave, soldiers coming in, policemen everywhere,' she said. She lost more than 10 acres of greenhouses, wiping away years of hard work. But more than that, she lost her dreams. 'Gush Katif is still very much anchored in us,' Beziz said. 'Coming to Israel and feeling like pioneers—that connection between the land, ourselves, and building a community—that’s powerful. It’s a part of you. Looking back at my life, it was a great achievement.' She added, 'The way that we were uprooted from this land—it’s something we cannot forget. It was done in a way that didn’t respect all we built.' A history of Jewish presence in Gaza Jews have been present in the Gaza region since ancient times. According to the Torah, the patriarchs Abraham and Isaac spent time there. Genesis 20:1 describes Abraham as settling in Gerar, a city within Gaza. Later, during a famine, Isaac considered traveling to Egypt, but God instructed him to stay in Gerar, saying: 'Dwell in this land, and I will be with you, and I will bless you; for to you and your descendants I will give all these lands' (Genesis 26:3). It was in Gaza that God reaffirmed His covenant, promising the Jewish people their inheritance in the Land of Israel. For centuries, Jews lived in Gaza—only to be repeatedly expelled. The Romans forced them out, followed by the Crusaders, Napoleon, the Ottoman Turks, the British in 1929, and the Egyptians in 1948. So when Israel reclaimed Gaza in the 1967 Six-Day War, it seemed natural for Jews to return and rebuild.'These were left-wing leaders at the time,' Vanunu said, 'but they understood there had to be a presence in Gush Katif. They believed that if you want to protect the southern part of Israel, you must have communities [in Gaza], not just army bases.' Of the 21 Jewish communities in Gaza, about 70% were religious or traditional, while the rest were secular. Most relied on agriculture. For 36 years, Gush Katif thrived, producing large quantities of peppers, tomatoes, flowers, and other crops for Israel and beyond. Vanunu, like Beziz, recalled that residents never believed the disengagement would happen. But as the reality set in, they launched an 18-month campaign to stop it. 'We went all over the country,' Vanunu said. 'We kept telling people it would be a disaster for Israel.' But in the end, he said, it became clear that even if most of the Knesset opposed the plan, Sharon would find a way to push it through. And that’s exactly what happened. A Life Built and LostVanunu remembers Gush Katif as a place with a 'special atmosphere,' a thriving community where life felt meaningful and connected to the land. He and his wife lived there for 11 years with their three children; now they have six. In December 2003, after years of waiting, they finally received the permits to build their home. Construction began immediately. But in June 2004, the government announced its decision to disengage from Gaza. 'My wife and I didn’t know what to do,' Vanunu recalled. 'We were hesitating, but in the end, we decided to move forward. We completed the home about five months before the expulsion. We loved it.' Beyond their home, they loved Gush Katif—the beaches, the farms, the greenhouses, and the vibrant flowers and plants.'Gush Katif was a miracle,' Vanunu said. 'When the Jews arrived, the Arabs asked what they planned to do with the land since it was just dunes. The Jews said agriculture. The Arabs said there was no chance—it was the desert. But the pioneers told them, ‘Don’t worry, you’ll see. This area will flourish.’ And it happened.' He added, 'We were able to make the desert heaven.' With Trump’s plan on the table, Vanunu has already considered whether he would return, saying, 'There is a good chance' he would despite everything he lost. After being forced out of Gaza, Vanunu lived in a hotel for six months, then in a caravan for nearly a decade before finally moving into a permanent home in Nitsan. Many families had it even harder—some waited 18 years to resettle. 'There was compensation,' he said, 'but it was very low compared to what we lost. Many families, despite receiving compensation, were not able to rebuild their lives.' For nearly 77 years, Israel has tried again and again to find solutions with the Palestinians, Vanunu said—whether by removing Jewish communities, withdrawing from hilltops, or even relinquishing entire cities. But each time, the result has been the opposite of peace. 'Gaza became Sodom,' he said. Now, for the first time in years, he feels a glimmer of hope that things might change. Beziz shares that hope, though cautiously. What matters most to her is that Israel and the world remember Gush Katif—not just as a painful chapter but as proof that Israel can rebuild and thrive even after the most challenging times. While not everyone managed to reclaim their lives, as Vanunu described, most of the 10,000 people who were evicted from Gush Katif in 2004 have since moved forward. 'Gush Katif is the Israel story—the Jewish story through the ages,' Beziz said. 'We can have a crisis, we can know trauma. But we can cope. We can make things better.'

With keffiyehs, masks and drums, Pro-Palestinian mob takes over B...	For hours, pro-Palestinian students block hallways and dean's office in administration building of Columbia University's women's college; staff member assaulted by protesters and required hospital treatment, school says More than 50 pro-Palestinian students at Columbia University stormed an administrative building at Barnard College, the university's women's college, late Wednesday night, staging a sit-in blocking the office of Dean Laura Rosenbury for several hours. The students, wearing keffiyehs and masks, carried drums, flags and signs reading 'Free Palestine,' demanding the reinstatement of two students suspended for distributing anti-Zionist flyers during classes, as well as the cancellation of disciplinary actions against students for pro-Palestinian activities. They also called for Barnard to divest funds and publicly condemn Israel’s military actions in Gaza. During the demonstration, a staff member was allegedly assaulted by protesters and required hospital treatment, according to Robin Levine, Barnard’s vice president for strategic communications. Protesters also spray-painted graffiti on building walls with messages such as 'Barnard expels students' and 'F–k Barnard.' Levine said that protesters had also encouraged other people to come on campus without identification. The administration offered to meet with the students if they removed their masks, but protesters refused. The protesters declared they would continue 'until our demands are met,' blocking hallways, drumming and distributing pro-Palestinian leaflets. Some reportedly shoved security personnel upon entering the building. The students eventually agreed to leave only after Barnard officials promised negotiations beginning Thursday afternoon to consider their demands for amnesty for all students they claim were suspended due to pro-Palestinian actions or speech. Barnard College President Laura Rosenbury later issued a statement confirming that the protest had ended: 'Tonight, a small group of masked protesters attempted to undermine Barnard's core values of respect, inclusion, and academic excellence. Thanks to the efforts of our staff and faculty, the protesters have now left Milbank Hall without further incident. But let us be clear: their disregard for the safety of our community remains completely unacceptable.' Brian Cohen, director of Columbia's Hillel student group, condemned the protest, saying it disrupted classes, led to violence against staff, and undermined the rights of Jewish students to study without fear of harassment. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Columbia University issued a response stating that the disruption was unacceptable, but emphasized that the matter fell under Barnard College’s jurisdiction. Outside the building, police set up mobile units, including a bus designated for mass arrests. Pro-Israel students said a planned counter-demonstration would proceed Thursday. Israeli professor Shai Davidai, who has become a prominent critic of the university’s handling of such protests, urged supporters to join the counter-rally, writing online: 'Angry about the images coming out of @BarnardCollege? Join me tomorrow to demand consequences. Don’t confuse our non-violence with submissiveness.' The incident echoed a similar protest in April 2024, when pro-Palestinian students occupied Columbia's Hamilton Hall, leading to mass arrests after the university called in New York City police. The university president at that time, Minouche Shafik, later faced heavy criticism and resigned in August 2024, partly due to backlash over her handling of the demonstrations. Her successor, Katrina Armstrong, publicly apologized to pro-Palestinian students for their treatment by university and police officials. Since taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order instructing the cancellation of visas for foreign students considered 'Hamas supporters,' enabling their deportation. The order pledges to 'investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist and anti-American colleges and universities' and instructs government agencies to identify and utilize all available legal tools against antisemitic attackers and harassers within 60 days. In an explanatory note accompanying the order, Trump warned: 'To all foreign residents who joined pro-jihadist demonstrations—we will find you and deport you.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjmkk96qje	2025-02-26T23:25:25-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/rJgHvdTcke/rJgHvdTcke_1_108_603_340_0_small.jpg

Ending the war would hand Hamas a victory, says Israeli security ...	Gilad Kabilo, an Israeli political and security advisor, explained that Hamas’s core strategy was to stop the war by taking hostages If Israel ends the war against Hamas in Gaza, the terrorist organization would be seen as the victor, according to Gilad Kabilo, an Israeli political and security advisor. He told ILTV News that the world is already witnessing this in the humiliating parades Hamas has staged with hostages. 'Suddenly, Hamas militants found their uniforms and are showing up in their masks and with their guns as Hamas militants and not as civilians as they've been fighting,' Kabilo said. He explained that Hamas’s core strategy was to stop the war by taking hostages. The idea that Hamas will eventually release all the hostages contradicts its fundamental strategy of using them as leverage for its survival. 'The general idea right now is to divide between either continuing and extending phase one—meaning the same prices, the same cadence, the same keys that we've been seeing—or to go to a new deal called phase two,' Kabilo said. 'The issue here is going to be the timing and the prices, which is more of the micro-technical. But on a larger level, is it going to be an end to the war? Something, in my opinion, that Israel cannot live with, but that for Hamas, is the core issue.'

Remains of hostages Itzik Elgarat, Ohad Yahalomi and Shlomo Manso...	After 510 days in captivity, Kibbutz Nir Oz confirms Yahalomi and Elgart murdered in Hamas captivity; Kibbutz Kissufim announces identification of Shlomo Mansour, the oldest hostage taken on October 7; their coffins, along with that of Tzachi Idan, returned from Gaza overnight Kibbutz Nir Oz announced Thursday morning that Itzik Elgarat and Ohad Yahalomi, who were abducted from their homes during the October 7 Hamas-led attack, were murdered in captivity in Gaza. The family of Shlomo Mansour was also informed that his remains were identified at the National Center for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv. The coffins of the three hostages were transferred to Israel overnight, along with the remains of hostage Tsachi Idan, whose identification has yet to be officially confirmed. The hostages had been held in Gaza for 510 days before their remains were recovered. Itzik Elgarat - remembered for his laughter and big heart Residents of Kibbutz Nir Oz described Itzik Elgarat, who was abducted at age 68, as a beloved figure in their community. 'We will remember him for his laughter, his big heart and his unwavering willingness to help anyone in need,' they said. 'For years, he served the kibbutz with dedication as a groundskeeper and was responsible for plumbing, gas and steam maintenance. He was an integral part of the social fabric, loved spending time at the local pub, hosting friends and connecting generations. His passion for soccer and backgammon was well known, and he was a star of local games—always with a smile and good spirit.' Elgarat is survived by two children, a brother and two sisters. Elgarat was abducted from the safe room of his home during the October 7 attack. Before being taken, he was wounded by gunfire and called his brother, Danny, for help. Danny guided him on how to apply a tourniquet, but their conversation was abruptly cut off. For a long time, his fate remained unknown, until it was confirmed that he had been taken alive despite his injuries. Elgarat had previously lived in Denmark, where his children reside, before returning to Israel several years ago. His brother, Danny, became a prominent voice in the fight to bring the hostages home, regularly attending protests, giving media interviews and speaking at Knesset committees. This week, in a session of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, he asserted that his brother did not die due to military pressure but rather succumbed to starvation in captivity. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'My brother was not killed by an Air Force strike—my brother starved to death. He simply starved,' Danny said. 'They could have brought him out. In November, there was a deal, but they gave up on all the elderly and went to war instead. Now, all those elderly hostages are buried. They are all dead. Who will take responsibility for this? Who will answer for the decision to leave them there?' he asked the attendees. 'We warned, we pleaded, we said time was their oxygen.' Ohad Yahalomi - devoted family man and nature conservationist The kibbutz also paid tribute to Ohad Yahalomi, who was murdered in Hamas captivity at age 50, describing him as 'a devoted and loving family man, a sports enthusiast and an avid hiker who knew every trail and landmark in the desert he cherished.' 'For years, he worked at the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, dedicating his life to protecting nature,' the kibbutz statement continued. 'His deep love for the desert led him to co-publish a scorpion field guide and take part in educational initiatives within the Bedouin community. We will always remember him as a man of values, full of compassion, who loved both people and the land.' Yahalomi is survived by his wife, three young children, extended family and many friends. The Yahalomi family was abducted in its entirety during the October 7 attack. Ohad’s wife, Bat Sheva, and their two young daughters were taken on one motorcycle, while their son, Eitan, was placed on another. Ohad, who was left behind injured, was later seized as well. As the kidnappers neared the Gaza border, the terrorist transporting Bat Sheva and her daughters panicked and fell off the bike. Seizing the moment, she managed to escape with the girls. However, the captors continued into Gaza with Ohad and Eitan. Eitan endured 52 days in captivity—16 of them alone—before being released. Yahalomi, a dedicated ranger at the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, remained missing for months. 'We have no information about him,' Bat Sheva said in an earlier interview. 'That’s the worst part—living on shaky ground, with no certainty. It’s gut-wrenching.' 'I can’t begin to imagine what this time is doing to the hostages,' she continued. 'Every day adds another unbearable weight of despair. We were in that hell for just one day, feeling like no one was coming to save us. What must they be feeling?' Shlomo Manour - the grandfather to everyone Hadassah Lazar, Shlomo Mansour's sister, confirmed that the family had been notified of the official identification of his remains at the National Center for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv. 'None of this should have happened,' she said. 'It is heartbreaking that in our own country, we are forced to take solace in receiving a body to bury.' She added, 'I am filled with rage over what happened. I don’t know if this is truly a form of comfort—I am just full of anger. Now, we all owe him an apology. As a child, he survived the Farhud pogrom, and now, in his old age, he could not survive the catastrophe that befell us on October 7. He was a man of rare character.' Kibbutz Kissufim, from which Mansour was abducted during the October 7 attack, paid tribute to him, describing him as 'a beloved and cherished figure.' 'For us, Shlomo was the heart of our community—the grandfather to everyone,' the kibbutz said in a statement. 'Always with a warm smile, never forgetting a single birthday, always calling to say 'mazal tov.' He had a rare gift of making each person feel like they were the center of his world, through his warmth, kindness and selfless presence. His memory will stay with us forever. May his soul be bound in the bond of life. May his memory be a blessing.' Hamas handed over the remains of four hostages overnight. The coffins were transferred to the Red Cross shortly after midnight and were delivered to Israeli forces inside Gaza about an hour later. In accordance with Israel’s demands, Hamas reportedly refrained from transferring the hostages' remains in a public display. Around 5 a.m., a convoy carrying the coffins arrived at the National Center for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv. Dozens of people awaited their arrival throughout the night, holding Israeli flags, yellow flags and banners of Hapoel Tel Aviv—the soccer team supported by Tsachi Idan, one of the victims. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1ievyaq1g	2025-02-26T21:48:50-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/r1M4kYT5Jg/r1M4kYT5Jg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
1 in 3 Israeli families lives in poverty, says NGO	In Israel, thousands go to bed hungry—this charity is making sure they don’t have to For many, Passover and Purim are holidays filled with family, fun, and food. But today in Israel, thousands of families go to bed hungry. 'One in three families is living under the poverty line in Israel, and we are here to help,' said Shimona Geffen of Yad Ezra v’Shulamit. That’s where Yad Ezra v’Shulamit steps in. Established in 1988, the organization provides 12,000 food baskets every week, ensuring no one is left behind. 'We want to make sure that everyone's needs are met and they receive everything they need for the week,' Geffen explained. The process is simple: anyone in need can apply for a food basket, and the organization will do everything possible to ensure their needs are met. 'Once we receive the application form, we then verify that these people need food for various means,' Geffen said. Operating nationwide, Yad Ezra v’Shulamit makes sure help reaches every corner of Israel, no matter where people live. 'We have 15 trucks that deliver food to 93 distribution points across Israel,' Geffen continued. Their mission extends beyond food. They provide clothing, school supplies, wedding support, and more—offering a safety net for those in need. 'We are the lifeline to many families across Israel,' Geffen emphasized. Their impact has been so significant that they have received government recognition. 'Recently, we were recognized by the Knesset for delivering the most amount of food every single week,' Geffen noted. But the demand only grows during the holidays. 'We don’t just stop there. We don’t just stop at weekly food baskets. For the holidays, we deliver over 60,000 food baskets, and this number is obviously determined by what we get in,' Geffen said. This article was written in collaboration with Yad Ezra v'Shulamit.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkppek69ye	2025-02-26T21:28:30-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/H1b18YT9yx/H1b18YT9yx_0_104_1024_577_0_small.jpg

Mount Hermon to reopen after year-long closure	After nearly a year and a half of closure due to the wars in Gaza and the north, the resort will finally reopen to visitors next week on March 4 Good news for Israeli snow lovers. The Mount Hermon Ski Resort has announced its reopening date. After nearly a year and a half of closure due to the wars in Gaza and the north, the resort will finally reopen to visitors next week on March 4th, according to the management team. However, the reopening is still pending final approval from the IDF, as the site has been designated a closed military zone under the Northern Command since last year. For now, the site will be open to visitors only, with no skiing due to significant war damage to the infrastructure, including direct hits on two ski lifts. Repair efforts are still underway. Visitors will have access to a cable car ride, an extreme sledding attraction, and children’s snow sledding.

Tzachi Idan, Itzik Elgert, Shlomo Mansour and 1 other dead hostag...	Coffins taken to Institute of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv to determine cause of death; IDF and Israel Police special forces escort the convy while Isarelis come out holding flags to honor the hostages coming home Tzachi Idan, Itzik Elgert, Shlomo Mansour and 1 other dead hostage were en route to the Institute of Forensic Medicine early on Thrusday . They were returned to Israel on Wednesday after they were released by Hamas ending the first phase of the cease-fire agreement. The convoy was escorted by IDF and Israel Police special forces. A military honor guard received them at Kerem Shalom where preliminary forensic examinations were made to enable a positive identification. Chief military Rabbi, Brigadier General Rabbi Eyal Krim held a small religious ceremony upon their arrival. The families of the hostages were notified that their loved ones were to return and will get final confirmation after the forensic examination to determine the cuse of death is complete. Isarelis came out in the late night hours, carrying flags to honor the hostages as they made their way to the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv. 'We will honor those who were abducted and deserted,' they said. Many of those people, residents of the communities near the border, neighbors of those who were abducted. 'This has not been an easy day, Nahal Oz secretary Matan Weize said of his neighbor and freind Tzachi Idan. 'We've held on to hope until the last moment. But it was important to us to be here to pay respect as the convoy passes.' The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement on behalf of the family of Tzachi Idan, who was kidnapped on October 7 from his home in Nahal Oz: 'Our family received with great sadness the announcement from Hamas that our beloved Tzachi is no longer alive and his body will be returned to Israel during the night. We are all still waiting for the long-awaited certainty, which we will be able to receive only after he arrives in Israel and all the necessary tests are conducted by the authorized authorities of the state, while maintaining the privacy of Tzachi and his family.' 'Since Tzachi was kidnapped on his feet, we have received several signs of life, and in the previous deal in November last year, Tzachi was alive and expected to be released. We are grateful for the great love and support we receive from the citizens of Israel, the media and the Nahal Oz community. In these difficult times, we ask that our privacy be respected. We will update later after receiving details from authorized officials of the State of Israel,' the statement from the family also said. Tzachi Idan, 50, was kidnapped from his home in Nahal Oz, after terrorists who broke in and murdered his oldest daughter, Maayan. Their home became a sort of terrorist headquarters, where they gathered other families from the kibbutz. From there, they handcuffed and took Tzachi and Omri Miran, and Yehudit and Natalie Raanan, who have since been released. Tzachi worked in high-tech, was married to Gali for 18 years, and the two are parents of four: the late Maayan, 15.5-year-old Sharon, who was with her aunt in Tel Aviv on Oct. 7, 12-year-old Yael, and 10-year-old Shahar. His family and friends say that he was 'passionate about soccer and a fan of Hapoel Tel Aviv' Danny Elgert said his brother was sacrificed on the alter of politics. In a poem he wrote to his brother Danny said he was defeated in his fight to bring his brother home alive, the total victory was over him, he said aluding to the declarations of Prime Minister Benjamin Netayahu and others in his government that the war will be faught until total victory is achieved. 'We are very sad, we feel very bad, but right now we are focused on one thing - and that is to bring Itzik home, to Nir Oz, and there to give him all the respect he deserves,' he told ynet earlier. 'Enough time has passed and we need to face reality. If some mistake was made, which I find hard to believe, then we will be surprised. Right now we just feel great sadness,' he said. Elgert said that the family heard from hostages who were returned in the first deal two months after October 7, and later from Sagui Dekel Chen and Yarden Bibas that Itzik had been alive when he was kidnapped and that by April his condition had deteriorated and his life was in danger. Itzik, 69, was kidnapped on the day of the massacre from his home. He had been wounded by gunfire earlier and called his brother Danny to ask for help. Danny explained to him how to place a tourniquet, and then their conversation was interrupted. For a long time his condition was unknown, until it became clear that he had been kidnapped alive despite his injuries. Itzik had previously lived in Denmark, where his children live, and returned to Israel a few years ago. Shlomo Mansour, 85, was the oldest hostage held in Gaza. He was kidnapped on October 7 from his home in Kibbutz Kissufim, when terrorists took him and handcuffed him. His wife Mazal begged for her life and managed to escape. About two weeks ago, the kibbutz announced that it had been informed by the IDF that Shlomo had been murdered on October 7 and his body taken in to Gaza. He is survived by five children and 12 grandchildren. 'In accordance with Israel's demands, an agreement was reached with the mediators: our four fallen hostages will be returned tonight as part of Phase I, in an agreed-upon procedure and without Hamas ceremonies,' the Prime Minister's office said earlier. Earlier, a police source told Ynet that preparations are also being made in Israel to return the hostages' bodies. Violations from day one Negotiations for the next phase of the deal have been taking place all week in the U.S. between President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and the head of the negotiating team, government minister Ron Dermer. Internal discussions and processes have taken place within Israel. Israel plans to send a delegation as soon as the current phase is completed. At the moment it is not clear whether the delegation will arrive in Doha or Cairo, but as soon as the bodies are transferred Israel will be ready to send a team. Senior Israeli officials said that, over the past month, Israel has warned the mediators not to turn a blind eye to Hamas' violations. During talks in Doha, and later in Cairo, Israel made it clear that it views Hamas' violations as serious. These violations include Hamas' decision to disrupt the implementation of the agreement when a cabinet discussion on Phase II began and the decision not to hold the previous meeting. In talks in Cairo, Israel made it clear that the debasing and humiliating handover ceremonies are unacceptable, both in terms of the danger to the hostages as in the case with with Arbel Yehoud and Gadi Mozes, and also in the manner in which the degrading ceremonies are performed. Israel specifically warned against such degrading ceremonies with the dead hostages. And although the message was conveyed and received, Hamas held shocking ceremony with the offins of the Bibas family and Oded Lipshitz, and in addition they transferred a Gazan body to Israel, instead of that of Shiri Bibas. Israel was also outraged by Hamas' shocking act last Saturday of bringing Guy Gilboa Dalal and Aviatar David to the release ceremony of Omer Shem Tov, Omer Wenkert and Eliya Cohen. 'We warned against this and we will not tolerate this as the next attack,' said an Israeli official. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bbomfesaw	2025-02-26T17:22:27-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/27/Sy3CoSa5Jl/Sy3CoSa5Jl_1_39_1280_721_0_small.jpg

The BBC censored Gazans remarks in controversial documentary: Ins...	BBC accused of mistranslating anti-Jewish rhetoric in 'Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone' documentary, sparking allegations of bias and whitewashing The BBC has been accused of 'whitewashing' participants’ views in its controversial Gaza documentary by mistranslating references to 'the Jews' and omitting praise of 'jihad.' An investigation by The Telegraph found that on at least five occasions, the words Yahud or Yahudy —Arabic for 'Jew' or 'Jews'— were changed to 'Israel' or 'Israeli forces' in subtitles, or removed entirely. In one instance, an interviewee praised Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar for his 'jihad against the Jews,' but the BBC translated it as 'fighting Israeli forces.' The broadcaster also faces pressure to clarify whether taxpayer money was given to Hamas during the production of 'Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone.' Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said counter-terror police should investigate if funds were transferred. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has also raised concerns with BBC director-general Tim Davie. 'It is essential that the BBC maintains the highest standards of reporting,' she said, adding that she expects to be informed of the findings of the broadcaster’s internal investigation. The documentary, originally promoted as an 'unflinching' look at life in Gaza, was removed from iPlayer after it emerged that one of its main participants was the son of a Hamas minister. New translations by the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis (CAMERA) have raised further questions about the BBC’s handling of the film. In one scene, a Gazan woman fleeing an area under attack says: 'The Jews invaded our [area].' The BBC subtitles quoted her as saying: 'The Israeli army invaded our area.' In another, a boy says: 'The Jews came, they destroyed us, Hamas and the Jews.' The subtitles rendered this as: 'The Israelis destroyed everything, and so did Hamas.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: During a distressing moment where a doctor amputates a child’s arm, the subtitles quote him saying: 'Look what the Israelis are doing to the children of Gaza.' However, the word 'Israeli' was not actually used, according to CAMERA. A young girl watching Iranian missiles in the sky during the Islamic Republic’s attack on Israel in October 2023 is quoted in the subtitles as saying: 'We’re used to seeing flashes of lightning in the sky. But now it’s real missiles.' However, CAMERA’s translation states she actually said: 'At first, when we would see these [flashes], they would be flares, by the way. From the Jews. But now they turned out to be [real] missiles.' In another mistranslation, a woman discussing the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks is quoted as saying it was the 'first time we invaded Israel.' However, she actually said: 'We were invading the Jews for the first time.' Later, a Palestinian woman showing footage of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is quoted as saying he was 'prepared for battle,' but CAMERA’s translation states she actually said he was 'ready for jihad.' Another subtitle quotes her as saying Sinwar was 'fighting and resisting Israeli forces,' but the actual translation, per CAMERA, is: 'He was engaging in resistance and jihad against the Jews.' Alex Hearn, co-director of Labour Against Antisemitism, accused the BBC of 'sanitizing' views about Sinwar and presenting a 'more acceptable version for a Western audience.' 'This whitewashing keeps viewers ill-informed about Hamas and promotes sympathy for their deadly ideology,' he said. 'It signifies the institutional failure behind the BBC’s reporting of the Israel-Hamas conflict.' Orly Goldschmidt, a spokeswoman for the Israeli embassy in the UK, called the mistranslations 'intentional' and a 'sinister and misleading policy.' She said the changes 'excuse racism' and 'do not allow viewers to see how children, and Palestinians at large, have been taught to hate ‘Jews’ from a very young age.' She also criticized the omission of 'jihad,' arguing that it 'downplays the threat of terrorism that Israelis face daily.' 'The issue goes beyond one documentary,' she added. 'It reflects a serious and systematic problem at the BBC regarding its anti-Israel bias.' The BBC did not comment on the latest concerns but referred to previous findings by its editorial standards committee, which had not upheld complaints regarding the translation of the word Yahud. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjjj2ba5yx	2025-02-26T13:24:51-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/SkZs0Yu39Jg/SkZs0Yu39Jg_0_0_767_427_0_small.jpg
71 serving life sentences, Shalit deal releasees and convicted ki...	After a five-day delay due to Hamas violations and its macabre ceremonies, Israel is set to release more than 600 Palestinian prisoners; Of these, 457 will be sent to Gaza, including many arrested after the October 7 massacre As part of the release last week of six living hostages, Israel is expected to free 620 Palestinian prisoners, whose release was postponed due to Hamas violations in the previous round, when the bodies of four hostages were returned. Among those to be released, 71 were sentenced to life terms, while 60 others received lengthy prison sentences. A total of 97 prisoners will be deported outside Palestinian territories, five will be released to East Jerusalem, 37 to the West Bank, and 457 to the Gaza Strip. Additionally, 105 prisoners will be released with 24 hours' worth of medication, and five will be transferred by ambulance. The release also includes 47 prisoners who were re-arrested after being freed in the 2011 Shalit deal, as well as 445 Gazans who were detained following the October 7 attack. Following Hamas' controversial 'ceremony' in which it transferred the remains of hostages Oded Lifshitz, Ariel Bibas, and his infant brother Kfir, as well as an unrelated Palestinian woman’s body instead of Shiri Bibas, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced a decision to delay the release of 620 prisoners 'until the next hostages are freed and without further acts of desecration.' The prisoners were originally slated for release following the handover of six living hostages on Saturday. However, even after being loaded onto transport vehicles, they were returned to prison. Subsequent understandings led to the decision to transfer four dead hostages without a public ceremony. > Among those to be deported is Nael Barghouti, convicted of murdering Israeli bus driver Mordechai Yekuel in 1978. Barghouti was initially freed in the Shalit deal but later re-arrested for violating his release terms. Another notable prisoner is Salama Qatawi, who led Hamas prisoners in Israeli jails over the past four years. Jailed in 2009 for activities with Hamas’ military wing, he was sentenced to 15 years. Also being released is Bilal Abu Ghanem, sentenced to three life terms for the 2015 attack on Jerusalem’s Bus 78, which killed Chaim Haviv, Alon Govberg and Richard Lakin. Another prisoner set to be freed is Khalil Jabarin Abu Hamid, who murdered Ari Fuld in 2018 at the entrance to a shopping center in Gush Etzion. He was sentenced to life in prison. Also released will be Omar al-Zaben, who was convicted on multiple counts related to deadly attacks, sentenced to 27 life terms plus 25 years, and imprisoned for more than 19 years. A senior figure in Hamas' military wing, he was found responsible for multiple attacks that killed 27 Israelis. This phase of the prisoner release, which was postponed, includes three veteran prisoners who will all be deported outside Palestinian territories. Alongside Barghouti, Samer Mahroun will be released after serving 38 years for the 1986 murder of a yeshiva student in Jerusalem, and Alaa al-Din al-Bazian, who served 42 years for involvement in various attacks, including the 2014 abduction and murder of Israeli teenagers Naftali Frenkel, Gil-Ad Shaer, and Eyal Yifrah. On Thursday, Israeli ministers voted on a last-minute swap in which seven prisoners originally slated for deportation chose to remain in prison, and seven others were selected in their place, four of whom are now designated for expulsion. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1xodz65kg	2025-02-26T12:54:00-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/B1eUXtRpKkx/B1eUXtRpKkx_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Michael Rapaport on Bibas family tragedy: 'Devastating, heartbrea...	Actor, comedian and outspoken Israel supporter says coffins' should serve as wake-up call to the world; condemns captors’ actions as 'disgusting, demonic' Actor and comedian Michael Rapaport has long been an outspoken supporter of Israel, unafraid to share his views on social media. In an interview Wednesday, he reflected on the funeral of the Bibas family—mother Shiri and her two children, Ariel and Kfir — whose deaths in captivity in Gaza shocked and devastated many around the world. 'May their memory be a revolution,' Rapaport said. 'Their story touched everyone, and obviously, this is not the ending we wanted. It’s a horrific, heartbreaking loss. I can’t even begin to imagine what their family is going through.' The Bibas family was among the hostages taken to Gaza during the October 7 attack. After months of uncertainty about their fate, it was revealed that they had been killed by their captors in Gaza. Their bodies were returned last week for burial. Rapaport said that the images from their funeral procession, particularly the sight of their small coffins, may have finally awakened some people to the brutality of those responsible. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I do feel like the world is starting to wake up,' he said. 'Hamas, Hezbollah, the Iranian regime — they’ve never hidden their intentions. Their only goal is to terrorize, to kill Jews, to destroy Israel. It’s not a secret. They say it openly, and their actions prove it. What happened to the Bibas family—how they were treated, how they were paraded around — it was disgusting, demonic. I hope and pray the world is finally seeing them for what they are.' Rapaport, who has used his platform to call for the release of Israeli hostages, said he is determined to keep speaking out. 'The world must not forget them,' he said. 'America must not forget them. There are still five Americans in captivity, along with so many others. Every single one of them must be freed — immediately.' The comedian, known for his passionate and often unfiltered commentary, said that, despite the criticism he receives online, most of the responses in recent weeks have been supportive. 'Social media is fake, but I feel like the vast majority stand with Israel,' he said. 'Of course, there are the lunatics, the provocateurs, and the fake accounts. But overall, I believe most people understand the truth of what’s happening.' For Rapaport, his advocacy is deeply personal. 'There was never a choice — I stand with my people, and I always will,' he said. 'The pain I feel is nothing compared to what the Bibas family’s relatives are going through, what the hostage families are going through, what the soldiers fighting in the IDF are facing. I try to take myself out of the equation and keep fighting for them as long as I can,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/byw2jdh91g	2025-02-26T12:17:20-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/rJDTnwn9Jg/rJDTnwn9Jg_0_114_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF presents investigation into October 7 massacre at Kfar Aza: '...	Investigation into massacre at Kibbutz Kfar Aza, where 64 were killed and 19 kidnapped, presented to community; Families express disappointment: 'Military says there was a 'failure,' apologized, but there was nothing we didn't already know' An IDF investigation into the October 7 massacre in Kibbutz Kfar Aza was presented to the community on Wednesday. The kibbutz was overtaken by Hamas terrorists during the terror attack, resulting in the murder of 64 members and the abduction of 19 others. IDF representatives emphasized at the start of the briefing that the army failed to respond in time, taking hours to arrive at the kibbutz. Brig. Gen. Rafi Milo, head of the Home Front Command, participated in the presentation. 'There was a huge gap between how we perceived Hamas strategically and the reality. That was the concept,' he acknowledged. Hundreds of community members attended the briefing, which was held at Kibbutz Ruhama in the Sha'ar HaNegev region, where Kfar Aza residents are temporarily housed. Among the attendees was hostage survivor Amit Soussana. Kfar Aza officials issued a statement following the presentation, describing the IDF’s investigation as 'shocking, difficult, and a further testament to the fact that Kibbutz Kfar Aza was overtaken on the cursed morning of October 7 by hundreds of terrorists, and its residents were abandoned. For hours, community members cried for help and fought almost alone, showing heroism and camaraderie against hundreds of murderers. The local defense team fought valiantly without any soldiers entering the kibbutz until late morning. Even when soldiers did arrive, it was without control or command.' The statement continued: 'Sixty-four members of our community were murdered, 19 were abducted from their homes, and dozens of buildings were burned or severely damaged. This is an unimaginable failure of the IDF’s command and defense apparatus. The investigation is thorough, but to the critical question of where was the IDF — there is no real answer.' The community emphasized that Israel has a moral obligation to bring home its members twin brothers Gali and Ziv Berman, and all the other hostages. It also called for ensuring that all security and physical conditions are met for the rehabilitation of Kfar Aza. 'We will forever remember and honor the soldiers and security personnel who arrived, fought with determination, and sacrificed their lives for us,' according to a statement from the community. Before the full investigation was presented, a general overview was given to the bereaved families from the kibbutz. Several of them, present at the meeting with Milo, shared that there was significant tension in the room and that the families left dissatisfied with the answers provided. 'There was nothing in the investigation,' they said, 'They said it was an ‘intelligence failure,’ which is all we've been hearing for a year and a half. There was nothing new. They didn’t focus on the data. They just apologized from start to finish.' One bereaved family member added: 'Grieving parents were in tears. He (Milo) took responsibility, which we don’t accept, claiming he regretted not going to fight that day. Why would he, as head of the Home Front Command, go fight? He said the main problem was that we became addicted to intelligence — and the intelligence said there were no irregularities.' Another family criticized the investigation, claiming it described events 'as if they were in an alternate world — and we weren’t there.' Earlier this month, Ynet reported new revelations about the massacre. The IDF’s investigation, which will be published Thursday and has already been shared with communities in the Gaza border area, reveals a number of failures during the October 7 attack in Kfar Aza. According to the investigation, in at least one instance, an IDF soldier mistakenly killed a civilian who had been abducted with his vehicle. The soldiers believed the individual was a terrorist and opened fire. The victim’s family was recently updated on the findings but had initially suspected friendly fire. The investigation outlines a series of failures, including delays in the forces’ arrival at the kibbutz and a failure to enter and engage Hamas terrorists, as the soldiers waited for further orders. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The investigation also revealed that, after some soldiers entered the kibbutz and cleared areas of Hamas fighters, they did not secure the area and left. It later emerged that terrorists returned to the kibbutz and continued their killing, abduction and destruction. Additionally, the evacuation of civilians, many of whom had gathered at the gas station outside the kibbutz, was not documented, which prevented forces from understanding who was still inside their homes and hindered further combat. Another mistake in judgment was the decision to evacuate civilians to the gas station, which turned out to be a poor choice, as additional terrorists were present in the area. The soldiers assigned to protect civilians inside the station did not conduct external defense operations. The decision to evacuate kibbutz residents by bus on Route 232 toward the Sha'ar Hanegev Junction was also questioned, as the buses were unprotected and the area was still under attack. Fortunately, the buses were able to travel safely, despite the ongoing fighting. The investigation also highlighted failures in handling the bodies of civilians, local defense team members, and security forces. The IDF and emergency services evacuated bodies to collection points in the kibbutz without documenting the location or circumstances of the deaths, which could have provided critical information for investigation and for the victims’ families. Despite these findings, the kibbutz emphasized that 'the forces that did eventually enter fought like lions, some knowing they wouldn’t survive. IDF soldiers saved lives in Kfar Aza, and they rescued civilians from their homes despite everything.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkwxr02q1e	2025-02-26T11:31:18-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/29/Byp3JKBnv6/Byp3JKBnv6_0_179_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Trump addresses Phase II of hostage deal, says decision on cease-...	Trump says next steps in hostage deal depend on Israel, expresses concern over returned bodies; 'They think they're doing us a favor by sending us bodies' U.S. President Donald Trump commented Wednesday on the transition to Phase II of the cease-fire and hostage return deal, stating that the decision regarding the continuation of the deal and the cease-fire in Gaza lies with Israel. 'This is a decision that needs to be made by Israel, by Bibi. Israel has to make this decision,' Trump said during a press briefing at the White House when asked about potential progress in the ongoing negotiations. Trump expressed disappointment at the recent return of four bodies of victims, emphasizing the tragedy of young lives lost. 'These are young people. Young people don’t die,' Trump remarked. 'They think they're doing us a favor by sending us bodies.' He described one particularly disturbing account, recounting how how hostage Emily Damari was injured after trying to shield herself from a bullet, which blew off part of her hand. 'This is a vicious group of people, and Israel’s going to have to decide what they’re doing,' Trump added. The president continued, highlighting the emotional toll on families who have lost loved ones. 'I’ve spoken to a lot of parents and people involved. They want those bodies almost as much, if not more, than they want their son or daughter. It’s incredible the level of importance they place on bringing back the bodies,' he said, noting the emotional depth of families requesting their deceased loved ones' remains. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Trump further remarked on the condition of some victims, comparing them to survivors of concentration camps. 'The first group that came in two weeks ago looked like they just got out of a concentration camp. The next group that came in wasn't in as bad a shape, but Israel's going to have to make a decision,' he said. Trump stressed that while Phase 1 of the deal is concluding, it remains a sad situation as bodies continue to be returned. As the discussions around the hostage deal continue, Trump’s remarks underscore the complex decisions ahead for Israel regarding the future of the cease-fire and the ongoing hostage negotiations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skcmtjpqke	2025-02-26T11:10:01-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/HyrP1RhcJg/HyrP1RhcJg_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

The White House on Wednesday denied reporters from Reuters and other news organizations access to President Donald Trump's first cabinet meeting in keeping with the administration's new policy regarding media coverage. The White House denied access to an Associated Press photographer and three reporters from Reuters, HuffPost and Der Tagesspiegel, a German newspaper. TV crews from ABC and Newsmax, along with correspondents from Axios, the Blaze, Bloomberg News and NPR were permitted to cover the event. On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced the White House would determine which media outlets would cover the president in smaller spaces such as the Oval Office. The White House Correspondents' Association has traditionally coordinated the rotation of the presidential press pool. Reuters, an international wire service, has participated in the pool for decades. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that while traditional media organizations would still be permitted to cover Trump on a day-to-day basis, the administration plans to change who participates in smaller spaces. The pool system, administered by the WHCA, allowed select television, radio, wire, print and photojournalists to cover events and share their reporting with the broader media.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjackepcjg	2025-02-26T10:49:00-08:00	
Sagui Dekel-Chen's wife shares first photos together at home	Avital Dekel-Chen posts pictures on her Instagram account following her husband's recent release from Hamas captivity; 'we're home, starting fresh' Avital Dekel-Chen, wife of Sagui Dekel-Chen who was freed from Hamas captivity in the hostage deal, shared their first photos together at home on Tuesday, writing: 'We're home, starting fresh.' Sharing a photo of a sunset, she added, 'I watched these sunsets for over a year — if you look far enough, you see Gaza. That’s how I communicated with Sagui all this time. I would stand on the balcony, look far and send him strength. Today, I stand here again, still seeing Gaza — but this time, Sagui is beside me.' Two days before his release, Sagui learned that Avital and their daughters had survived Hamas' attack on October 7 for the first time. 'You're my hero,' Avital told him during their first hug. Sagui responded: 'You're heroes, you kept me going.' Avital asked: 'Do you remember what you called her?' referring to their third daughter, born after his abduction. 'Mazal,' Sagui said. 'That's her name,' Avital confirmed. 'Mazal?' he asked in surprise. 'Her name is Shahar Mazal,' Avital said. 'Perfect, what a name,' Sagui responded. His aunt, Gilat Fish, told Ynet that Sagui learned to play chess to pass the time and delivered messages from hostages still held in Gaza while in captivity. 'He knew nothing about the situation in Israel, his family or what was happening, whether he was underground or above ground,' she said. Like other hostages, he also learned Arabic during his time in captivity. Sagui, who was released on February 15, spoke by phone with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week for over 10 minutes. He told Netanyahu that only the release of all hostages would bring a true victory. The conversation was described as positive, with Netanyahu saying he was committed to bringing everyone home. Sagui urged him to set politics aside and act solely on professional considerations, saying he had believed this was how Israel was operating throughout his captivity.

Three generations of Shiri Bibas' family were murdered	On October 7, Hamas terrorists set fire to the home of Shiri Bibas' parents, the Silbermans; initially declared missing, their remains were discovered three weeks later, confirming they were murdered inside their house; 'Watch over us, my five angels,' pleaded Shiri’s sister, Dana Silberman-Seaton, the family's sole survivor Shiri Bibas' sister, Dana Silberman-Seaton, the sole surviving member of the immediate Silberman family, delivered a heartbreaking eulogy during the funeral of Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas, recalling life with her younger sister. The Silberman-Bibas family has endured a tragedy spanning three generations. Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir — who were returned alongside the body of fellow hostage Oded Lifshitz, buried the day before — were not the only victims. On October 7, Hamas also murdered Shiri’s parents, Margit and Yossi Silberman, in their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. Yossi Silberman was born in Argentina in 1956 and was one of the founders of Kibbutz Kramim near Dimona, where he met his wife, Margit, who was originally from Peru. The couple later moved to Nir Oz, where they raised their two daughters, Dana and Shiri. While Dana relocated to her husband’s moshav, just a 15-minute drive away, Shiri remained in the kibbutz. Yossi worked in agriculture and later as a mechanic in the kibbutz’s garage. He had a passion for painting and spent years teaching art. Margit, a beloved educator, was considered one of the kibbutz’s most cherished kindergarten teachers, helping to raise generations of children. On October 7, Hamas terrorists set fire to the Silbermans’ home. Initially declared missing, their remains were discovered three weeks later, confirming they had been murdered inside their house. Margit was 63; Yossi was 67. Dana Silberman-Seaton, who lost both her parents and later her sister’s entire family, had hosted them at her home in Moshav Yesha the night before the massacre. The following morning, as Hamas launched its assault, Dana and her own family barricaded themselves in a safe room while fierce battles raged outside. At Wednesday’s funeral, Dana eulogized her sister and nephew, recalling the childhood nickname she gave Shiri — 'Baz' (Hebrew for 'falcon'). Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Shiri and I grew up in a home filled with love, compassion and understanding. Our parents raised us to be strong women, to love others and to respect those who are different from us,' Dana said. 'As kids, I was the annoying older sister, and Shiri was always the sweet, innocent one. When we picked up our kids from daycare, we would always go straight to our parents’ house. The moment we walked through the door, our parents would rush to hug and kiss their grandchildren. Shiri and I would just look at each other and say, ‘I guess we’re not really needed here.’ That was the kind of love they had for their grandkids — an incredible, special kind of love.' Addressing her lost family, Dana added: 'Please, watch over us from above — you, my five angels who belong only to me. Baz, hug Mom and Dad tight for me and take care of them. Please send us strength to wipe out the evil in this world so that only good remains.' 'I promise you, as I promised Mom and Dad, that the monsters beyond the fence will not succeed. They will not break us. They will not defeat us. In fact, they have already failed — because we have united, because we have grown stronger, because we are unbreakable. They have lost. 'I hope that, wherever you are, you are together, wrapped in Mom's and Dad’s embrace.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bynp002351g	2025-02-26T09:03:54-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/r1Vbmu3qJg/r1Vbmu3qJg_48_37_456_257_0_small.jpg
Partisan gap in Americans' opinions of Israel reaches record high	US partisan views of Israel reach a record 50-point gap, with Republicans overwhelmingly favorable and Democrats' ratings plummeting, according to a new Gallup poll; Opinions of the Palestinian territories also show significant shifts The partisan divide in Americans' views of Israel has reached an all-time high, with 83% of Republicans holding a favorable opinion, compared to just 33% of Democrats. Among independents, 48% view Israel positively. Overall, 54% of Americans rate Israel favorably, a significant drop from previous years, according to a new Gallup poll released on Wednesday. The 50-point gap between Republicans and Democrats on Israel shatters the previous record of 30 points set last year, reflecting a sharp 14-point decline in Democrats' favorable views. This widening divide is nearly three times larger than the 18-point average difference between the two parties from 2001 to 2023. Democrats' increasingly negative opinion of Israel is largely attributed to their opposition to the country’s actions during the Israel-Hamas war. The shift also coincides with former President Donald Trump’s strong support of Israel, including a recent meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In addition to Israel, there are sharp partisan divides in opinions of other countries. Republicans view Russia and Saudi Arabia more positively than Democrats, while Democrats rate Panama, France, India and Germany more favorably. The opinions of political independents on Israel have also deteriorated since the war began in 2023. This year marks the first time that any political group has had a majority unfavorable view of Israel, with 60% of Democrats and 44% of independents expressing negative opinions. As a result, Israel’s favorability rating among Americans has dropped to 54%, its lowest point since January 2000. The last time the country received worse ratings was in February 1992, when just 48% of Americans viewed Israel positively. The all-time low was 45% favorable in 1989. Meanwhile, the favorable rating for the Palestinian Territories has increased to 32%, significantly higher than the 18% registered last year for the 'Palestinian Authority.' While it remains unclear if the increase is due to more positive views of the Palestinian people, perhaps as a result of the cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war or the loss of thousands of Palestinian lives in the conflict, or if it is simply due to a change in the wording of the question, it represents a shift in public opinion. This rating is nominally higher than any previous rating for the 'Palestinian Authority,' although not significantly different from the 30% measured in 2021. All party groups rate the Palestinian Territories more positively than they did the Palestinian Authority last year, with increases ranging from 13% to 19%. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjfpzt29jx	2025-02-26T08:49:11-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/08/H1HwCk7JJl/H1HwCk7JJl_0_0_1000_563_0_small.jpg

Murdered at age 4: Teddy bears, and a drawing from a friend place...	Yoav bid farewell to his best friend from Kibbutz Nir Oz, Ariel Bibas, writing in a drawing placed on Ariel’s grave 'I am sad'; His mother recently shared the questions her son has asked since Ariel was kidnapped — and described the moment she had to explain to him that his friend would not be coming back Ariel Bibas, the 4-year-old who was murdered in Hamas captivity, had a close friend in Kibbutz Nir Oz named Yoav Avital. Since Ariel was kidnapped at the age of 3, Yoav never stopped believing in and waiting for his friend’s return. On Wednesday, a simple drawing was placed on Ariel’s grave alongside teddy bears and flowers. In it, little Yoav wrote: 'Died at age 4' and 'I am sad.' Ariel was buried alongside his mother, Shiri, and his infant brother, Kfir, who were murdered in captivity by the terrorists holding them. Yoav’s mother, Yamit, recently shared how her son experienced the tragedy of his friend’s abduction and murder. 'I want to tell you a bit about the thoughts and questions from my children's perspective,' she wrote. 'Ariel Bibas was my youngest son Yoav’s friend. They grew up together from infancy. When the first hostage deal was announced, with each group of released captives, he kept asking about Ariel and Kfir —when would it be their turn to come back? 'From time to time, Yoav would ask me if I knew what was happening with Ariel and Kfir, telling me how much he missed them and worried about them. He even asked to write a letter for Ariel and give it to his kindergarten teacher, Mali, so she could pass it on when he returned. He told me what to write: 'Ariel, I want to draw you Batman and all the flying heroes so you’ll feel like flying over Gaza. And fight the bad guys with a bow and arrow. Then you’ll come back to us and be with us in kindergarten. I hope you buy yourself sweets and a cape. I miss you.’ 'A few weeks later, realizing Ariel still hadn’t returned, Yoav asked to send a message on the radio, hoping Ariel would hear it and find strength to come home. Every so often, he asked if Ariel and Kfir had a kindergarten in Gaza if they were allowed to play in the sand and run outside like they did in the kibbutz. 'Last Purim, Yoav wanted to keep his Batman costume for Ariel, ‘because he’ll be back any day now.’ And when he didn’t return, Yoav decided to wear it himself — to fly off and rescue him. 'In the past six weeks, we explained the hostage deal and its details to our children. When Yoav heard the news, he jumped with joy — Ariel would be home soon. Unfortunately, we also had to tell them that some of those returning would not be alive. That was Yoav’s biggest fear. He immediately asked, ‘So Ariel is dead? He’s not coming back?’ I told him we didn’t know yet. That same day, he began to say goodbye in his own way. Through tears, he said, ‘My heart hurts. It feels heavy. I can’t stop thinking about him.’ 'But we still had hope, and we waited like everyone else. 'Every Saturday, my children asked if Ariel was coming home this time. But each time, only older hostages returned. Then came the questions: ‘Where are Ariel, Kfir and Shiri? They’re the smallest ones — why aren’t they being released first? Shiri is a woman — shouldn’t she be freed before the men?’ Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Yoav said, ‘Maybe they love Ariel so much there because he’s funny and mischievous, and that’s why the terrorists don’t want to let him go.’ 'Last Tuesday, when the list of hostages returning alive was published, we understood we had to prepare our children. When the final news arrived, the questions came, innocent children’s questions: '‘What? Why? How did he die? How could they do that? Why would they kill them? But they didn’t do anything to them. He was only 5, younger than me, and Kfir was just a baby…’ 'And then came their thoughts: ‘If he’s coming back in a coffin, that means he’s standing inside it. So that means he’s still alive.’ '‘But how does he fit in a coffin lying down? He’s still alive, Mom, you didn’t understand it right.’ '‘If Ariel is a fallen hero, that means he’s flying in space. He can’t be dead.’ 'And then the suggestions: ‘But in Israel, there are really smart people, right, Mom? Maybe they can invent a special potion with ingredients that can bring Ariel and Kfir back to life. It will have a bit of Batman’s two knives, fire, speed and a cape so he can fly fast to Gaza. There, the knives will cut open the bottle quickly, the potion will spill on him, and he’ll be able to come back. Simple.’' Yamit continued: 'Sadly, I had to explain that the dead cannot come back to life. And he answered me, ‘But I miss him. Can I see him just one more time?’ With tear-filled eyes, all I could tell him was that he could see Ariel in his dreams — hug him tight, play superheroes, splash together in the pool, explore bugs and plants, tell him how he’s doing, and hear how Ariel is doing too.' 'Shiri, my dear, I want to believe that just as you wrapped your arms around Ariel and Kfir during the abduction, you held them close until the very last moment. You will always remain in my memory as a lioness of a mother. 'Your story was meant to end differently. We all wished for a happy ending. But now that we have certainty, knowing you are no longer suffering and that you are home, on Israeli soil, we ask you to rest in peace — the peace you so deserve. We will stay with our longing. And from that longing, we will grow again.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r111u112hcyx	2025-02-26T08:18:42-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/r1KZKYh5ke/r1KZKYh5ke_223_0_1051_591_0_small.jpg

Bodies of 4 hostages to be returned tonight as hundreds of Palest...	The final release for Phase I: The 4 remaining hostages set to be returned in Phase I of the cease-fire deal will be brought to Israel late on Wednesday night; Hamas has provided the names and Israeli officials are informing the families; Khan Younis is preparing to receive hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, whose release has been delayed by several days The four remaining hostages set to be returned in Phase 1 of the cease-fire and hostage-return deal will arrive in Israel late on Wednesday night in the final round of the current phase; the release of the bodies is scheduled for 11:00 p.m. At the same time, the Palestinian prisoners whose release has been delayed since Saturday will be handed over. Hamas published the names of the four hostages, but all of the names have not yet been made public in Israel. So far the family of Tzachi Idan, who was kidnapped alive, has announced that his body will be returned on Wednesday night. Israel confirmed Wednesday afternoon what was first reported by the Qatari Al Jazeera network regarding the release of the four hostages and the handover of the prisoners. An Israeli official later confirmed the report. Earlier, a police source told Ynet that preparations are also being made in Israel to return the hostages' bodies. The Hamas Prisoners' Office said that 'preparations are beginning at the European Hospital in Khan Younis to receive the prisoners released as part of the seventh round of the exchange deal, as they are expected to arrive between 10:00 p.m. and midnight.' This is how it will work The release of the dead hostages is supposed to be taken care of without a handover ceremony, with Egyptian involvement and mediation. According to the agreement, Hamas was to hand over to Israel a list of the names of the four dead hostages that will be returned - something it has already done. After that, the coffins will be delivered to Egypt via the Red Cross. At the same time and in a phased manner, Israel will release terrorists according to a specific outline that has been agreed upon. The outline will be carried out with Egyptian involvement and Egyptian supervision that will ensure that Israel receives the dead and releases the terrorists according to the progress of the process. Israel made it clear earlier that, until there is a final identification of the bodies, the last group of terrorists will not be released. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We will not release all the terrorists until we have a final identification and our people are handed over to us,' said a senior Israeli official. Once Israel verifies that the hostages are in Egyptian hands, a gradual process of releasing the terrorists will begin. The release will be done in several stages that could last a few hours in total. Initially, a specific group of terrorists will be released, then Israel will drive additional terrorists south toward the Kerem Shalom crossing. In the meantime, Israel will verify that the bodies are actually those of the kidnapped Israeli hostages. 'At any given moment, Israel has terrorists in its hands until they are finally identified,' a senior Israeli official emphasized. Violations from day one Negotiations for the next phase of the deal have been taking place all week in the U.S. between President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and the head of the negotiating team, government minister Ron Dermer. Internal discussions and processes have taken place within Israel. Israel plans to send a delegation as soon as the current phase is completed. At the moment it is not clear whether the delegation will arrive in Doha or Cairo, but as soon as the bodies are transferred Israel will be ready to send a team. Senior Israeli officials emphasized that, over the past month, Israel has warned the mediators not to turn a blind eye to Hamas' violations. During talks in Doha, and later in Cairo, Israel made it clear that it views Hamas' violations as serious. These violations include Hamas' decision to disrupt the implementation of the agreement when a cabinet discussion on Phase II began and the decision not to hold the previous meeting. In talks in Cairo, Israel made it clear that the debasing and humiliating handover ceremonies are unacceptable, both in terms of the danger to the hostages as in the case with with Arbel Yehoud and Gadi Mozes, and also in the manner in which the degrading ceremonies are performed. Israel specifically warned against such degrading ceremonies with the dead hostages. And although the message was conveyed and received, Hamas held shocking ceremony with the offins of the Bibas family and Oded Lipshitz, and in addition they transferred a Gazan body to Israel, instead of that of Shiri Bibas. Israel was also outraged by Hamas' shocking act last Saturday of bringing Guy Gilboa Dalal and Aviatar David to the release ceremony of Omer Shem Tov, Omer Wenkert and Eliya Cohen. 'We warned against this and we will not tolerate this as the next attack,' said an Israeli official. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkzkbhncyl	2025-02-26T06:54:35-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/20/SkJxGIfcEq1g/SkJxGIfcEq1g_0_116_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Speaking to ILTV News on the sidelines of the B'Sheva Jerusalem Conference on Monday, Rothman said he believes former U.S. President Donald Trump would support sovereignty. However, he emphasized that the most Trump and his administration would do is to say, 'you do whatever you want.' 'We have to make this loud and clear that we want sovereignty, that we are working towards sovereignty, and we are willing to do what it takes,' Rothman said. Watch: Could Israel Permanently Seize Gazan Land?

As precedent, he pointed to past fears that an international backlash would follow the U.S. Embassy’s move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem—yet no such crisis occurred. He also cited the U.S. recognition of the Golan Heights and the fact that Jews now pray openly on the Temple Mount, despite it contradicting the status quo.

Mother who fatally stabbed son declared psychotic, faces psychiat...	Prosecutors request acquittal of Sigal Itskovitch for murder of her 6-year-old son Liam after psychiatric evaluations determined she was experiencing a psychotic episode at the time; may face 25-year psychiatric commitment Prosecutors on Wednesday requested that the Tel Aviv District Court acquit Sigal Itskovitch, 33, of murdering her 6-year-old son Liam, citing psychiatric evaluations that determined she was in the midst of a psychotic episode at the time of the crime. Instead of a prison sentence, the prosecution asked the court to commit Itskovitch to a psychiatric hospital for 25 years. The court is expected to announce its decision on Sunday. During the hearing, Itskovitch admitted to the facts in the indictment, describing her erratic behavior on the day of the killing. 'I changed clothes, went out with an ax toward the mall, chased a passerby, struck a Mercedes car hood with the ax, confronted a guard, stripped and performed obscene gestures,' she said. The judge questioned why authorities had not intervened earlier, noting a 2019 incident when Itskovitch climbed onto a roof with Liam, then a baby, and asked if the murder could have been prevented. The prosecutor did not provide an answer. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The murder took place in July of last year, when Liam’s body was found in the family’s Herzliya home, along with the family dog, Buffy, who was also killed. According to the indictment, 'Liam suffered at least 15 slash wounds to his body, arms and face as a result of his mother's stabbings.' The indictment further detailed that Itskovitch repeatedly stabbed her son with an 8-inch kitchen knife 'until the knife broke.' After stabbing her son in the bathroom, she moved to the living room, where the injured family dog was howling in pain from earlier stabbings. Fearing the neighbors might hear the howls, she stabbed the dog dozens of additional times. She then walked toward a nearby mall, frightening passersby and attempting to attack a security guard before being arrested. The boy’s grandmother later discovered the crime scene. During her interrogation, Itskovitch confessed to the horrific acts and expressed remorse. When asked why she killed her son, she said: 'I don’t know what happened to me. Maybe a demon possessed me. I was in a frenzy; everything went black before my eyes, and a voice told me to do it. I stabbed them quickly—my son and the dog—grabbed the ax, and left the house without knowing what I was doing. I ran into the street, completely confused, until they stopped me.' Throughout the legal proceedings, defense attorneys argued that Itskovitch was in a severely disturbed mental state, but the prosecution initially pursued a harsh sentence. The case shifted when psychiatric evaluations confirmed her diminished responsibility. Itskovitch claimed she had experienced hallucinations, including conversations with aliens and beliefs of being abducted by a spaceship. Legal experts say the court’s ruling could set a precedent for cases involving claims of mental incapacity. Liam’s father, Doron Hess, who was not home at the time, described the moment he realized what had happened, recalling how he collapsed upon seeing a search and rescue vehicle. He pointed at the vehicle and asked a police officer, 'Is it Sigal?' The officer replied, 'No,' prompting Hess to realize the truth and collapse to the ground.

Freed terrorist faces charges for traffic offenses during release...	Police charges freed Hamas terrorist Ashraf Zghair and two relatives for reckless driving during his release celebration in Kafr Aqab Israel Police on Wednesday filed charges against Hamas terrorist Ashraf Zghair, 46, and two of his relatives. The three are accused of recklessness, failing to wear seat belts and partially hanging out of a moving vehicle while celebrating Zghair’s release in Kafr Aqab, north of Jerusalem. The indictment was filed as Israel mourned hostages murdered in Hamas captivity, including Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas. According to the charges, Zghair was released from prison on January 25 as part of the hostage deal's second handover. He had been imprisoned since 2002, serving six life sentences for transporting the terrorist who carried out a bus bombing in Tel Aviv, which killed six people and wounded 84. Following his release, a reception was held for Zghair in Kafr Aqab, attended by locals and family members. The celebration included Hamas flag-waving, live gunfire, slowed traffic and cheers for the freed terrorist.

'By doing so, they posed a real danger to their own safety and lives, in clear violation of the law, while recklessly waving to the crowd gathered on the road,' the police said in a statement. Days later, security forces arrested 12 suspects involved in the incident. A search uncovered Hamas flags, banners, fireworks, an airsoft gun, a large sum of money and other items. After concluding the investigation and gathering sufficient evidence, prosecutors filed the indictment Monday morning at the Jerusalem Traffic Court. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry8snq3ckg	2025-02-26T05:49:50-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/SJqtbD2qyg/SJqtbD2qyg_245_90_462_261_0_small.jpg

Iran's stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% of weapons grade, has jumped since Iran announced a dramatic acceleration in enrichment in December, a quarterly UN nuclear watchdog report showed on Wednesday. The stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% in the form of uranium hexafluoride grew by 92.5 kg in the past quarter to 274.8 kg, one of two confidential International Atomic Energy Agency reports to member states seen by Reuters said. That is enough in principle, if enriched further, for six nuclear bombs, according to an IAEA yardstick.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjv64ih9jx	2025-02-26T05:28:15-08:00

Shalom Avitan arrested in Kuala Lumpur carrying 6 guns and ammunition, claims was hunting another Israeli over a family dispute A Malaysian court sentenced an Israeli man to seven years in prison on Wednesday after he pleaded guilty to carrying six guns and dozens of bullets, his lawyer said. Shalom Avitan, 39, was arrested last March at a hotel in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, and later charged with unauthorized trafficking and possession of firearms, while a married Malaysian couple was charged with supplying him the weapons.

Iran’s weakness won’t last—should Israel act now?	British-Israeli analyst and writer Jonathan Spyer: 'Israel is leaning toward decisive action to try to bring down the regime in the Islamic Republic of Iran' Iran and its proxies have taken serious blows, but 'their weakness is a perishable asset,' according to British-Israeli analyst and writer Jonathan Spyer. In an interview on the ILTV News Podcast, Spyer said Israel has not managed to eliminate any of the threats surrounding it—Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, or Iran itself. 'Every day that passes, they’re going to be getting stronger,' he warned. Spyer explained that Israel’s current military strategy is not unlike previous approaches, often referred to as 'mowing the lawn.' The idea is to weaken the enemy, watch it regain strength, and then strike again. However, he believes there is growing recognition that this cycle cannot continue. Israel, he said, may soon need to strike at the source—Iran—to put an end to regional terrorism. 'Israel is leaning toward decisive action to try to bring down the regime in the Islamic Republic of Iran, in the belief that, and I think it's an accurate belief that, at the end of the day, it is Iranian strength and Iranian assistance which enables these other fronts to maintain themselves,' Spyer said. He added that Israel sees a 'window of opportunity' for a decisive strike on Iran’s nuclear capabilities in the coming year. If Israel does not act, that window could close as Iran strengthens its defenses, likely with advanced air defense systems from Russia. Meanwhile, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and other Iranian-backed forces will have time to replenish and fortify. 'There’s a moment now where, if Israel is bold, it can try to fundamentally change the equation,' he said. Watch these previous ILTV News Podcasts: The Secret Behind Israel’s Dominance in AI Innovation William Daroff: If 40% of Gazans Want Out, Why Not Let Them Leave? Why the world can’t ignore Iran’s nuclear ambitions any longer The Hamas War: A Shifting Strategy Spyer noted that Israel entered the war in Gaza with two clear goals: to return the hostages and to destroy Hamas militarily and politically. However, he argued that Israel has not pursued both objectives with the same intensity. 'Israel has been trying to fight Hamas militarily, but it has not, in fact, been trying to replace Hamas politically,' he said. 'And the reason for that, I think, is because none of the potential goals, which are the ones I outlined earlier, are really acceptable to various parts of either Israel itself or its allies.' As a result, Israel has opted for a wait-and-see approach. 'The response of the government of Israel has been to kind of kick the can down the road,' Spyer added. He acknowledged that Israel has demonstrated impressive military capabilities, such as the recent 'beeper attack' against Hezbollah. However, its inability to establish an alternative to Hamas in Gaza presents a major challenge. Spyer also pointed to a fundamental intelligence failure regarding Hamas before October 7. While Israel had prepared for threats from Hezbollah and other enemies, it severely underestimated Hamas’s capabilities. 'Israel was blind, willfully blind, prior to October 7 as a result of a massive intelligence failure on the strategic level,' he said, 'which then, of course, leads down, as such things do, to additional failures and weaknesses on the tactical level.' A Crossroads in the War Now, Israel faces a critical decision. Negotiations are underway for a second phase of the hostage-for-ceasefire deal, which U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff has said could go through. However, the deal would require Israel to withdraw further from Gaza—while Hamas remains in control. Spyer is skeptical about the deal’s prospects, saying there is a 'very large question mark' over whether it will progress as Witkoff expects. 'Throughout the war, the government of Israel has had two contradictory aims, one of which is to ensure the release of all the hostages, and the second is the destruction of the Hamas authority, of Hamas political and military power in Gaza,' Spyer explained. 'These two goals are, of course, contradictory, because it's not, in fact, possible to negotiate with anybody and at the same time seek to destroy them. It just doesn't work in real life.' He believes the contradiction is coming to a head now, as phase two of negotiations demands Israeli concessions. 'I think that the government of Israel and Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu are reluctant to reach that point,' Spyer said. 'Maybe they would like to keep kicking the can down the road, or maybe they want to get down to pursuing the war regardless of the remaining presence of 25 hostages. It’s not clear.' His own stance? End the negotiations and finish the war. 'Israel's enemies have got used to Israel [negotiating], and we know that that can have very tragic results,' Spyer concluded.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjfugck5jg	2025-02-26T04:33:37-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/ByUeu5nc1l/ByUeu5nc1l_0_83_801_451_0_small.jpg

I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you': Yarden Bibas delivers heartbr...	Released hostage mourns wife Shiri and sons Ariel and Kfir, murdered in Gaza captivity, in emotional ceremony: 'Watch over me so I don’t sink into darkness' Yarden Bibas, whose wife Shiri and young sons Ariel and Kfir were murdered in Hamas captivity, delivered an emotional eulogy Wednesday, speaking of his profound grief and the shattered dreams of his family. Read the full eulogy below: 'Mi amor, I remember the first time I called you Mi Amor. It was early in our relationship, and you told me to call you that only if I was absolutely sure I loved you—not to say it lightly. So, I didn’t say it right away because I didn’t want you to think I was rushing to say I love you. But Shiri, I’ll tell you now—I already loved you then when I first said Mi Amor. Shiri, I love you, and I will always love you! Shiri, you are everything to me! You are the best wife and mother, Shiri, you are my best friend. Mishmish, who will help me make decisions now? How am I supposed to make decisions without you? Do you remember our last decision? In the shelter, I asked you, Do we fight or surrender? You said, We fight, so I fought. Shiri, I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you. If only I had known what was going to happen, I wouldn’t have fired a shot. I think about everything we shared, and there are so many good memories. I remember the births of Ariel and Kfir. I remember the days we would sit at home or in a café, just the two of us, talking about everything. It was so much fun—I miss that, and I miss you so much. Your presence is deeply missed. I want to tell you about everything happening in the world and here in Israel. Shiri, everyone knows us and loves us—you wouldn’t believe how surreal this madness is. Shiri, people tell me they will always be by my side, but they are not you. So please, stay close to me and don’t go far. Shiri, this is the closest I’ve been to you since October 7, and I can’t kiss or hug you—that breaks me. Shiri, please watch over me… Protect me from bad decisions. Protect me from harm. Protect me from myself. Protect me so I don’t sink into darkness. Mishmish, I love you! Chuki, You made me a father. You made us a family. You taught me what really matters in life and what responsibility means. The day you were born, I grew up in an instant because of you. You taught me so much about myself, and I want to say thank you. So, thank you, my love. Ariel, I hope you are not angry at me for not being able to protect you properly, for not being there for you. I hope you know that I thought about you every single day, every single minute. I hope you are enjoying yourself in heaven. I’m sure you’re making all the angels laugh with your jokes and impressions. I hope there are lots of butterflies for you to watch, just like you did on our picnics. Chuki, be careful when you come down from your cloud—don’t step on Tony… Teach Kfir all your impressions, and make everyone laugh up there. Ariel, I love you the most in the world, always in the world—just like you used to say to us. Pupik, I never thought our family could be any more perfect—and then you came along and made it even more perfect. I remember your birth. I remember that in the middle of labor, the midwife suddenly stopped, and we panicked—we were afraid something was wrong. But it was just so she could tell us that we had another redhead. Mom and I laughed and cheered. You brought even more light and happiness into our little home. You came with your sweet, infectious laughter, and I was hooked instantly! It was impossible not to snuggle you all the time. Kfir, I’m sorry I didn’t protect you better, but I need you to know that I love you so much, and I miss you terribly! I miss holding you close and hearing your giggles. I miss our morning playtime when Mom would ask me to watch you before I left for work. I loved those little moments so much, and I miss them now more than ever. Kfir, I love you the most in the world, always in the world! I have so much more to tell you, but I will keep it for when we are alone.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk8iiuh5je	2025-02-26T02:26:44-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/rkxIl0035Je/rkxIl0035Je_0_0_552_314_0_small.jpg

NY governor calls out CUNY for ‘divisive’ Palestinian Studies job...	Kathy Hochul orders removal of Hunter College job listing for Palestinian Studies professor, citing concerns that its language—referencing 'settler colonialism' and 'genocide'—promoted antisemitic theories; CUNY complies Following a wave of controversy, New York Governor Kathy Hochul has ordered the City University of New York (CUNY) to remove a job listing for a Palestinian Studies professorship at Hunter College, citing concerns that its content could promote antisemitic theories. The job posting, which was advertised on Hunter College’s website, sought a scholar specializing in topics such as 'settler colonialism, genocide, human rights, apartheid, migration, climate and infrastructure devastation.' Critics argued that the language echoed longstanding accusations against Israel and framed the Jewish state as a perpetrator of crimes against humanity, turning an academic position into a platform for anti-Israel advocacy. Hochul, responding to mounting pressure from Jewish organizations and pro-Israel groups, issued a statement instructing CUNY to immediately retract the posting and conduct a thorough review of the role. 'I have directed CUNY to remove the job listing and to ensure that no antisemitic theories are promoted in the classroom,' Hochul stated. The move comes amid ongoing scrutiny of CUNY’s handling of antisemitism on its campuses. An independent investigation commissioned by Hochul last year revealed a 'disturbing' rise in antisemitic incidents, including harassment of Jewish students, glorification of Hamas, and a lack of administrative intervention. The findings fueled existing concerns about the university system’s response to anti-Israel activism, particularly following Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. Jewish watchdog groups and former CUNY officials were quick to condemn the job listing, characterizing it as a taxpayer-funded endorsement of anti-Israel rhetoric. Hunter College issued a statement attempting to defuse the controversy, asserting that the institution 'has zero tolerance for hate of any kind' and that its faculty are expected to engage in rigorous academic debate rather than promote any single ideology. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: CUNY later confirmed that the job listing had been removed from the website following the governor’s directive. 'We unequivocally agree with the governor’s decision,' a CUNY spokesperson said, adding that the wording of the posting was 'divisive, polarizing, and inappropriate.' However, critics remained unconvinced, pointing to what they see as a pattern of anti-Israel bias within CUNY’s faculty and student organizations. The controversy surrounding the job posting follows other high-profile incidents at CUNY that have drawn accusations of institutional antisemitism. Earlier this year, CUNY’s faculty union, the Professional Staff Congress, passed a resolution in support of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement targeting Israel — a decision it later overturned following backlash. Similarly, past commencement ceremonies at CUNY Law School have featured speakers delivering inflammatory remarks against Israel and the United States, adding to the university’s growing reputation as a battleground for ideological disputes over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The broader implications of this controversy extend to state funding for CUNY. Hochul’s executive budget proposal includes $2.25 billion in operational funding for the university system, along with $1.8 billion allocated for capital improvements. The backlash over Hunter College’s hiring decision has sparked debate over whether taxpayer dollars should be used to fund what critics describe as 'state-sponsored antisemitism.' ' The Governor has continued to strongly condemn all forms of antisemitism and has made clear that hateful rhetoric of any kind has no place at CUNY or anywhere in New York State,' stated Hochul's office. CUNY, for now, has publicly aligned itself with Hochul’s directive. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ynld3cyg	2025-02-26T01:31:22-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/05/22/B1TnYIwPc/B1TnYIwPc_27_0_2134_1201_0_small.jpg

Graffiti left by IDF troops turn southern Lebanon homes into a ca...	As residents return to destroyed villages near the Israel border that housed IDF troops fighting Hezbollah, they find battle-scarred walls bearing the story of the war Residents of southern Lebanon have been gradually returning to their villages to find their homes heavily damaged by the fighting between Israel and the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah. As they scour what remains, they are discovering that the battle-scarred walls of their houses serve as a canvas for Israeli soldiers and Hezbollah supporters who tell the story of the war. The scrawled messages give insight into the battles that erupted after Israel launched a ground invasion into southern Lebanon in October 2024, months after Hezbollah began firing rockets and drones at Israel in solidarity with the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas in the Gaza Strip. A ceasefire in November allowed Lebanese residents to begin returning to their homes, which had been occupied by Israeli troops. One yellow wall had written on it signs of preparedness: the cardinal directions in red. On another is what appears to be a battle plan: a hand-drawn map, a list of soldiers slated for a task and supplies — a drone, a stretcher. 'Wake up Kochuk every hour on the hour from 20:00,' reads one instruction, apparently referring to a soldier. Elsewhere, a warning to the returnees: 'We will be back,' scribbled in English, in gray spray paint, with a Star of David; the word Lebanon in red, with a large X crossing it out. One message reads cynically, 'Thanks for the hospitality,' with a heart.

And still other messages appear intended to leave a personal mark: 'Congratulations, mom,' scrawled in dark red on a bright pink bedroom wall, above a bed piled with belongings and near a photo of a local couple. In another room, with windows blacked out by tarps and littered with garbage, a Bible verse. In a kitchen, inside an empty refrigerator alcove, a drawing of a blue menorah But not just messages from Israeli soldiers were left behind. Peppered throughout homes in the village of Khiam are notes in Arabic written by Hezbollah fighters or their supporters after Israeli forces withdrew earlier this month. They underscore the continued allegiance to Hezbollah despite the hard blows it endured during the war. 'Wish we lost everything and you stayed, Sayyed,' referring to Hezbollah’s longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in Israeli strikes in southern Beirut in September. 'Khiam is Golani’s graveyard,' reads a warning on one wall, referring to an Israeli military unit. On another, a message of defiance: 'Our flag will not fall. ... We will not drop our weapons.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/b1mm0v2cyg	2025-02-26T00:39:19-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/H1lfZQH3qyg/H1lfZQH3qyg_447_403_2088_1176_0_small.jpg

Authorities say Saeed Hasanein expressed support for Hamas, made statements against IDF, referring to it as an 'occupying army' Police arrested overnight Wednesday Arab Israeli journalist and former soccer announcer Saeed Hasanein on suspicion of incitement after he voiced pro-Hamas statements during a media interview. Hasanein, 62, from Shefa-'Amr, was dismissed as the announcer for Israeli Premier League club Bnei Sakhnin F.C. following controversial remarks in which he called Israel 'the enemy.' Police said he also expressed support for Hamas, referred to the IDF as an 'occupying army,' and described Arab Israelis who enlist as 'weak-minded individuals.' Following multiple complaints, police in the Northern District launched an investigation, reviewed evidence and determined there was cause to suspect incitement.

October 7 was not an accident—it was a disease that spread throu...	Commander of military intelligence Unit 8200 says IDF probe into failures leading to massacre overlooked key questions about its root causes; 'We did not see Hamas as an army, so we allowed it to remain at our border' Nearly 17 months after Hamas’ October 7 attack, the IDF’s top leadership convened to review findings from the military’s internal investigation. Among the 600 commanders present, Brig. Gen. Yossi Sariel, head of the military intelligence Unit 8200, drew the most attention, having already assumed responsibility and announced his resignation. He is set to be replaced in two weeks. Sariel delivered a scathing critique of Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and the investigation process, arguing that the inquiry failed to ask the most crucial questions and fully assume responsibility, instead shifting blame onto others. Sariel's criticism was professional, not personal. He and Halevi have been close friends for years, dating back to Sariel's time as an intelligence officer under Halevi’s command in the IDF’s 91st Brigade. 'On October 7 at 06:29, I did not fulfill my mission as expected by my commanders, myself and—most importantly—the citizens of this country that I love so much,' he said. 'I failed. This cannot be undone, and I bow my head and ask for forgiveness.' He detailed the thorough, six-day probe conducted within the Intelligence Directorate, involving all active and reserve colonels and brigadier generals. 'It was intense, earth-shattering. At times, I feared the intelligence apparatus would collapse, but because of these investigations, you now have a comprehensive inquiry,' Sariel said. He invited those present to read the full 148-page report documenting the mistakes and failures of Unit 8200. Sariel also addressed systemic military failures, saying, 'October 7 was not an accident—it was a disease that spread through the military. We failed to investigate how it spread, and that critical question remains unanswered.' He criticized the IDF for neglecting strategic assessments, particularly regarding Hamas’ growing military capabilities. He pointed to key intelligence failures, noting that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar had identified two conditions that would have deterred his attack: IDF tanks positioned at the border and drones in the air. 'We saw Hamas activating SIM cards and mobilizing emergency assets, yet we failed to respond. If we had deployed even minimal deterrence measures, the attack might never have happened,' he argued. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sariel accused senior commanders of avoiding accountability. 'Had we made just two decisions that night—to move the tanks and launch the drones—Hamas would have scrapped its plan, except for a single unit that would have been neutralized. If that had happened, would anyone here have said the success wasn’t theirs? Would they have passed the credit to the Air Force? Or would they have taken their share of the glory?' He concluded by warning that the IDF’s failure was not just operational but cultural. 'We did not see Hamas as an army, so we allowed it to remain at our border, minutes from civilian communities. We believed the land barrier and intelligence units alone would secure us. That was a fundamental flaw in our military structure and values,' he said. Referencing past political statements, Sariel remarked, 'A politician once said he was responsible for a disaster but not to blame,' alluding to former Public Security Minister Amir Ohana’s response to the 2021 Mount Meron tragedy. 'We in the military often looked down on politicians who were not raised on our values of real responsibility. But when we win, the entire military takes credit, and when we fail—suddenly, it’s only the lower ranks who are to blame.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1ys5e25kx	2025-02-25T23:29:58-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/yk14275135/yk14275135_0_86_614_346_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu appears for 13th day of testimony in corruption trial	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived at the Tel Aviv District Court on Wednesday for the 13th day of his testimony in the corruption cases known as the 'Case 1000,' 'Case 2000,' and 'Case 4000' investigations. At the start of the hearing, the judges addressed a request to pause proceedings to allow for the live broadcast of the funeral of the Bibas family. The judges denied the request, stating, 'We extend our condolences to the Bibas family and all the families of the fallen and murdered, but we will maintain the proceedings as scheduled.' Netanyahu responded by saying, 'I believe it is appropriate that we stand for a moment of silence and remember who and what we are fighting for.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1jlrb2cye	2025-02-25T23:21:22-08:00

Clip depicts Gaza in ruins, transforming into idyllic future enclave, with golden statue of Trump and enjoying a poolside tan with Netanyahu U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday shared an AI-generated video outlining his vision for the future of Gaza, pinning it to his Truth Social page. The video opens with images of war-torn Gaza before posing the question, 'WHAT'S NEXT?' in red, white and blue. It then shifts to surreal scenes, including a beachside resort, a bustling marketplace, Elon Musk eating flatbread, bearded belly dancers and a child holding a gold Trump balloon. The imagery also features cash raining from the sky, a golden statue of Trump and a 'Trump Gaza' hotel, where he and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are depicted sunbathing by the pool. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Earlier this month, Trump sparked controversy across the Middle East by proposing the removal of all Palestinian residents from Gaza to allow for its redevelopment. The suggestion drew swift condemnation from regional leaders, including Jordan’s King Abdullah and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who dismissed any forced displacement of Gazans as unacceptable. Since then, Trump has walked back the urgency of his proposal, acknowledging alternative plans led by Egypt and other Arab nations. However, at a joint White House press conference with Netanyahu, he reiterated his belief that his plan would bring stability, saying, 'Everyone loves the idea.' Trump also framed the initiative as an economic opportunity, predicting that rebuilding Gaza would create jobs and transform the area into a global tourist attraction, even likening its potential to that of a 'Riviera.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skcfuv25kx	2025-02-25T23:03:45-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/ByfJvQ29Jl/ByfJvQ29Jl_0_215_272_154_0_small.jpg

Syrians call on leader to 'bomb Tel Aviv' after IDF strikes	Defense Minister Katz confirms Air Force strikes south of Damascus as preventive policy against local terror groups; Lebanon reports additional strikes despite Hezbollah cease-fire Saudi outlet Al-Hadath reported on Wednesday that 'aircraft, likely Israeli, carried out four strikes on military positions in the Al Kiswah area.' The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Israel carried out 'a series of strikes on military sites in Damascus' countryside' and later reported at least four fatalities. Hezbollah-affiliated Al Mayadeen noted these were the most significant strikes since Syria's interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa took office. It claimed Israel 'infiltrated Syria’s communication network before the strikes' and is 'expanding into southern Syria to fully control the area.' Protests were held in Damascus and Homs against 'Israeli actions in southern Syria and attempt to partition the country,' with demonstrators chanting, 'Oh dear al-Joulani (al-Sharaa's previous nom de guerre), bomb Tel Aviv.' Another Syrian report said an additional strike hit the village of Ezra in Daraa province. Al-Mayadeen cited sources saying an old Syrian army base was targeted. Defense Minister Israel Katz previously confirmed that the Israeli Air Force carried out a 'powerful strike in southern Syria as part of our new policy to demilitarize the area.' 'The message is clear: we won't allow southern Syria to become southern Lebanon. We won't risk our citizens' security,' Katz said. Reports later indicated at least two people were killed in the strike. Katz warned that 'any attempt by Syrian regime forces or terrorist organizations to establish themselves in southern Syria's buffer zone will be engaged.' The IDF said it struck 'military targets in southern Syria including command centers and multiple sites containing weapons.' 'The presence of military forces and assets in the southern part of Syria poses a threat to the citizens of Israel. The IDF will continue to operate in order to remove any threat to the citizens of the State of Israel,' it added. Meanwhile, Lebanon reported two people were killed in an Israeli strike in the Beqaa Valley. Lebanon's health ministry said two people were killed and three were injured. Al-Mayadeen reported that an Israeli drone carried out the strike near the village of Janta. The IDF confirmed it targeted two terrorists involved in manufacturing and storing strategic weaponry. 'Activity at the site is a blatant violation of Israeli-Lebanese understandings,' the military said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hezbollah condemned the strike. Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese MP Ibrahim Moussawi called it a 'serious violation.' Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem did not issue a direct threat but said, 'We won’t accept idly being killed and occupied.' Despite the cease-fire with Hezbollah, Israel continued striking targets in Lebanon to prevent violations and weapons smuggling to the terror group. Hezbollah has suffered heavy losses and its internal strength in Lebanon has weakened. Under the cease-fire, the Lebanese army is required to take control of areas previously under Hezbollah’s authority. 'We're acting aggressively against Hezbollah targets, as seen in recent strikes,' A military source said earlier this week. 'They're trying to regain a foothold,' he said. Last week, a Hezbollah-affiliated source told The Wall Street Journal that the terror group instructed its non-southern Lebanese operatives to vacate their posts so the Lebanese army could take control as per the cease-fire agreement. 'Hezbollah suffered heavy losses,' the source said, adding the group had partially replenished its ranks with fighters from Syria, making some units ready for renewed fighting. 'The organization is weakened but not defeated,' he claimed. The Wall Street Journal reported that Hezbollah has been humiliated and is struggling financially, to the point where it’s having difficulty fulfilling commitments to its operatives. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjd7snh9ke	2025-02-25T22:13:48-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/25/SJlRxf3o9Jg/SJlRxf3o9Jg_0_428_472_266_0_small.jpg

Funeral procession for Shiri, Kfir and Ariel Bibas begins in Rishon Lezion and end at Sha’ar HaNegev Junction; public urged to line route with Israeli flags; private ceremony, without government officials, will be broadcast at 11:30 a.m. Israel time The bodies of Shiri Bibas and her two sons, Ariel and Kfir, abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7, will be laid to rest Wednesday in a private ceremony attended only by family and invited guests. The funeral procession will depart from a funeral home in Rishon Lezion at 7:45 a.m., traveling through multiple junctions before reaching the final burial site at Tzohar Cemetery. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has called on the Israeli public to line the roads with flags as a tribute to the Bibas family during their final journey. Due to space constraints, the family has requested that government officials, including ministers and Knesset members, refrain from attending both the funeral and the mourning period. Ahead of the burial, national landmarks, including the Knesset, were illuminated in orange, symbolizing the hair color of the Bibas children. Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion said the tragedy 'leaves us speechless,' calling the attack that claimed their lives 'unimaginable cruelty.' Shiri Bibas' body was formally identified at the National Center for Forensic Medicine over the weekend after being transferred from Hamas under delayed circumstances. Initially, Hamas handed over the remains of an unidentified Palestinian woman, claiming Bibas' body was lost in the rubble. Israeli authorities confirmed that Ariel and Kfir’s remains had been identified earlier, concluding that all three had been executed in captivity during the first weeks of the war.

Yarden Bibas, Shiri’s husband and the children’s father, was released from Hamas captivity earlier this month after nearly 500 days. His sister, Ofri Bibas, said the past two weeks had been an emotional whirlwind for him. 'We went from overwhelming joy at Yarden’s return to devastating sorrow upon learning that Shiri and the children were murdered in captivity,' she said. 'He is still struggling to process the loss and the public attention, often wondering how Shiri would have handled all of this. But she is no longer here to go through it with him.' The Eshkol Regional Council has encouraged residents to stand along major junctions from 9:00 a.m. to pay their respects, noting that thousands are expected to gather along the funeral route. Organizers have asked attendees to bring Israeli flags as a show of unity. Meanwhile, police will be deployed near the cemetery to ensure security and traffic control.

Amir Avivi. He told ILTV that the attack is going to be decisive in order to eradicate Hamas completely and also to release the remaining hostages. Avivi added that it is unlikely Israel and Hamas will move to Phase II of the ceasefire-for-hostage deal. He said there is too big a gap between the two sides: Israel wants Hamas to lay down its weapons and give Israel the hostages, while Hamas wants to remain in control of Gaza. 'There is an option to extend the first stage and release more hostages,' Avivi said. 'This is realistic. Hamas might want more time to organize, to release more terrorists, and to get more humanitarian aid.'

IDF presents massacre inquiry findings to Nahal Oz	Residents say officers stood before them apologetic and shamed, military was transparent providing information and answers; 'they took full responsibility and owne up to their failures,' one member said, 'unlile the government The IDF presented members of Kibbutz Nahal Oz with the findings of their investigations into the massacre on Oct. 7. One resident told ynet that the officers began with an apology and admitted the military had failed. 'We are sorry that we failed to protect you,' they said. Nahal Oz is was home to 500 residents and in the massacre 15 were murdered and eight others abducted. Not all of the residents came to receive the military's findings but thosw who did were presented with the investigation's outcome and given a chance to ask questions. 'The went through the investigation thoroughly and it appears that it was done professionally and with sensitivity,' he said adding that they were told that the inquiry was not into the failings before the massacre, and only dealt with the actual event, which was disappointing to him. Present were General Dan Goldfus, commander of a paratroopers' division who was Col. (Res.) Yaron Sitbon and other generals from the Air Force and Homefront Command Some 180 Hamas terrorists infiltrated the Kibbutz on the fateful day, in three waves and the security team fought a persistent battle against them. Head of the Team Ilan Fiorentino was killed relatively quickly. Three members of the Kibbutz Tzachi Idan, Omri Miran and Joshua Mollel, a student of agriculture from Tanzania, who was murdered in captivity. Idan was supposed to be released by his captors in the first phase of the deal. Investigation appears to be thourough professional, done with sensitivity The first wave of terrorists entered the Kibbutz around 7 am from the back gate. Three hours later, others came from the north. The third wave an hour after that. There were 11 special forces in the Kibbutz who engaged the terrorists and prevented a more extensive massacre. One of them was killed and four others wounded. At noon, another force from the Maglan special operations unite headed to the Kibbutz but encountered terrorists on the access road and only managed to reach Nahal Oz at 1:15 pm. Members said the military was unable to explain why the security team did not have long weapons with them, which were taken away by the IDF. 'We were told that was the order but found no paperwork to substantiate it,' they said. They also agreed to meet with Goldfus, at the Kibbutz again to discuss security arrangements. 'We felt like he was very committed to the Kibbutz,' residents said. The IDF generals told the residents that the military had not foreseen a war breaking out and there fore it took time for the forces to organize and arrive to Nahal Oz and the other communities who were under attack. The probe included a review of the battles in each of the homes. Residents said they found out from the inquiry that an infantry force from Golan had been fighting outside the kibbutz from the early morning hours and prevented an incursion of terrorists in the first wave but were later diverted to other areas where more fierce battles were underway. 'We learned that they had blocked many of the terrorists and we are grateful to them,' residents said. It was hard to see officers who faught so bravely in Gaza stand before us so small The members said they were surprised by the complete transparency of the findings presented to them which included recordings of the IDF communications. One member whose house was invaded said that being presented with the findings was an important step toward being able to return to his home. 'It highlighted what was missing and what was not done. There was full taking of responsibility and owning up to the failures. They said they were ashamed to stand before us,' he said. 'It was hard to see commanders who fought so bravely and Goldfus who led troops in Gaza, stand before us so totally small, compared to the fact that the government has never seen us, or even come to see what we look like and how we are living. There is a government that went missing not only on October 7 but for months following the massacre. That stood out to me.'

'The day of the massacre is etched into our hears as an open wound,' the kibbutz said in a statement after the findings were presented. 'The inquiry presented to us is earthshattering and returns us to that day. The kibbutz will stand on its feet again.

Tech talent crisis? Israel needs 13,000 engineers to sustain inno...	Afeka Academic College of Engineering in Tel Aviv says it has doubled enrollment to help meet the demand The world is advancing at an incredible pace. As technology evolves and industries become more high-tech, the demand for skilled engineers continues to grow. 'The entire IT industry has been disrupted in the past, maybe 10 years, with new waves of innovation, disruptive technologies, from networking to the cloud,' said Oren Sagi, managing director at Cisco Israel and chairperson of the Israel-America Chamber of Commerce. 'They started security challenges, and now with AI. And when we refer to AI, it's not only the LLM models, but how can we build the AI factory, the infrastructure that supports AI, the application security level.' To develop future engineers, a continuous education plan and essential skill-building are crucial. At Afeka Academic College of Engineering in Tel Aviv, education goes beyond academics. The institution has transformed the learning process to ensure students not only gain essential knowledge but also develop the skills needed to apply it effectively. This includes solving complex problems, working in or leading multidisciplinary teams, communicating ideas concisely, and continuing to self-learn throughout their careers. 'We discovered that everybody agreed that there is a need for the skills, but each institute has developed its own unique model to instill the skills for the graduates,' said Ami Moyal, president of Afeka College. 'We need to think strategically on a multi-year basis—what are the engines of growth that will make Israel secure and strong? And with this aspect, the economy, the high-tech industry, and the engineers are a major trajectory, with engineers as the only resource that we have. You know, in Israel, we don't have resources; we have only human capital. So, the investment in growing and improving the quality of engineers will flourish the economy.' Israel is currently facing a shortage of 13,000 engineers and software developers. Afeka College has stepped up to meet this demand. While it once enrolled around 500 students per year, that number has now doubled to 1,000. Today, more than 700 graduates enter the workforce annually, supplying the country with approximately 10% of the new engineers joining the high-tech industry. 'But I think our main role is to be an example of the need to change the educational process from the aspect of quality, specifically instilling skills in the educational process, because academia needs to change,' Moyal added. Israel is currently at war, and the country has urgent needs. Many donors have stepped up to help. But as Oren Sagi explains, long-term success requires a strategic focus on Israel’s future engines of growth—and that engine is its engineers. 'Eventually, the entire secret of Israel is talent,' said Sagi. 'This is the main source of innovation. This is the main source of success. And talent comes from the Academy and the Academy, and the connection between the academia, the Israeli academia, and the tech sector.' He said, 'We see so much rapid change within the tech industry, in the economy. So what I ask people, when I interview young engineers, they need to have the knife between the teeth. They need to have the energy in their eyes. They need to work very strong with the team and keep on being curious and to learn all the time.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkrytf2q1e	2025-02-25T19:39:47-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/B1Bpqfn5ye/B1Bpqfn5ye_0_0_640_361_0_small.jpg
Smotrich: If Hamas doesn't return hostages, Israel will seize Gaz...	Exclusive interview with Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich: 'Our current approach to getting the hostages out is not working' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich warned that if Hamas does not return all hostages by Saturday, Israel will permanently seize land in the Gaza Strip. The Religious Zionism Party leader stated that if the hostages—both living and deceased—are not returned, 'Israel will expand the agricultural areas of Kibbutzim Be’eri and Nir Oz into the perimeter area of the Gaza Strip.' He made the statement at the B'sheva 22nd Jerusalem Conference. ILTV caught up with Smotrich on the sidelines of the event. Smotrich: 'Our current approach to getting the hostages out is not working—Hamas is not buying it,' said Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. 'Instead, we are being asked to release hundreds of prisoners who, God forbid, will return to kill us. Hamas needs to be threatened. I told the prime minister: The day we resume fighting, the day this phase of the deal ends, we need to tell Hamas—we know exactly how many hostages are alive in Gaza. If even one of them is harmed, we will enact sovereignty over 5% of the Gaza Strip. Then another 5%, and another 5%, and another 5%. You will see—Hamas will protect the lives of our hostages more than its own, and they will return them. Because what matters most to Hamas is land. They don’t care if dozens of their people are killed—they place no value on life; they glorify death. It doesn’t even matter to them if Gaza is destroyed. They don’t care about their own citizens. But if we take their land, that will hurt them. This is the way. Don’t negotiate with them—make the threat real. I am convinced this is the only way to win, to destroy Hamas so that those Nazis never cross into our territory again, to prevent another October 7 in a few years, and to bring all our hostages home.' Sovereignty Over Judea and Samaria Another key theme of the conference was Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce his administration’s stance within two weeks, but leaders at the right-leaning event are confident annexation is coming. Smotrich: 'First of all, I want to say to you and your viewers: We have been implementing sovereignty for the past two years—even under the Biden administration, which seriously threatened us. We are making a revolution on the roads, establishing communities, and building tens of thousands of new housing units. But we need to enact full sovereignty—we need to apply it across Judea and Samaria. After October 7, everyone understands that a Palestinian state will not happen. It would mean taking Gaza, multiplying it by 20, and placing it on land that overlooks all of Israel. This would be a suicidal step, and we are not going to take it. President Trump understands this well. His administration and advisors understand it well. Israel will not commit suicide. They know that the Palestinians are still hostile, that they continue to support Hamas, and that their leadership remains committed to our destruction. We will enact sovereignty across Judea and Samaria, develop the settlements, and put an end to the concept of a Palestinian state. I am convinced that we can see eye to eye with the president and his team. Not only will this not harm the Abraham Accords—it will actually push them forward. Peace only comes from strength. We are in a region where people turn away from the weak and align with the strong. There will be a State of Israel—Jewish, democratic, strong, independent—an anchor of freedom, human rights, and values in the Middle East. With a state like this in the region, all the Arab countries will want to make peace with us, and I hope, God willing, that this will happen.' Israel’s Economic Resilience Amid War As finance minister, Israel’s economy remains a top priority for Smotrich. Before wrapping up his ILTV interview, he addressed the economic impact of Israel’s longest and costliest war. 'The economy of Israel over the past 16 months is quite simply a miracle,' Smotrich said. He noted that the shekel is stronger than before the war, the stock market remains strong, and Israel continues to be a top investment hub despite the conflict. Between October 2023 and October 2024, Israel raised $10.5 billion in investments—ranking third globally, behind only Silicon Valley and New York. Smotrich: 'This is, first and foremost, a result of the strength and diversity of the Israeli economy. We entered the war in a strong position, with fiscal responsibility and a budget that supports growth and infrastructure. But above all, it is due to the resilience of the people of Israel. Israel is healthy, strong, trustworthy, innovative, creative, and entrepreneurial. The free market we uphold in this country, along with responsible economic management, ensures confidence in the Israeli economy.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk1144m25kl	2025-02-25T19:19:29-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/26/r1P7Iz39Je/r1P7Iz39Je_65_0_1313_739_0_small.jpg

Impoverished UN moves to 'austerity measures' after Trump turns o...	First report: The UN is taking emergency measures to prevent a budget collapse, after the US under Trump stopped providing money; At the NY headquarters, the heating temperature will be lowered and maintenance work will be postponed; translation services will be cut; meetings will be shortened; and reports will be delayed: 'A period of unprecedented uncertainty, with a real impact on its ability to fulfill its mission' U.S. President Donald Trump is withholding the transfer of several budgets to the United Nations so far and the international organization, which is currently experiencing a serious economic crisis due to a sharp decline in its financial resources, has been forced to take drastic measures. According to a letter obtained by Ynet, the UN headquarters in New York has already begun making significant cuts, which are affecting the organization's ongoing activities. Among the steps taken: cutting translation services; reducing live broadcasts of plenary debates; stopping holding meetings after 6:00 p.m.; shortening the length of reports by 10%; limiting the number of meetings with translation and interpretation services; delays in producing official minutes; lowering the temperature in the offices to save on heating costs; and even closing one of the main entrances to the UN headquarters on 42nd Street in Manhattan. According to the letter, signed by the UN Secretary-General's Chief of Staff, Earle Courtenay Rattray, these steps are necessary to ensure that the organization can continue to operate, at least until the end of the year. 'Without immediate spending restrictions, we will not be able to meet our financial obligations from September to December,' the document states. It was also emphasized that due to the severity of the situation, the drastic measures taken last year will also continue, with new restrictions added to all key UN departments. The impact of the measures is evident in every aspect of UN activity. For example, official meetings will only be held between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., and discussions outside these hours – including on weekends – will only take place if funding for this comes from external sources. UN bodies that hold 10 or more meetings a week will be required to reduce them by 10%. Translation and interpretation services, essential for multilingual discussions, will be provided only during official hours, and only to a limited extent to those entitled to them, according to the regulations. Furthermore, the number of meetings budgeted for interpretation will be reduced to 55 per week, and the total number of meetings of the organization will be cut by 10%. The UN's 'outreach activities' are also being harmed The UN's internal communications are also being affected: the production of official documents will be significantly delayed; the length of reports will be reduced by 10%; and processing of official transcripts and records will only take place when funding is available. Another significant impact is on UN publications, including official reports and journals, which will experience significant delays in distribution. On the public level, the UN's outreach activities also are being severely affected: the number of live broadcasts will be significantly reduced; UNTV teams will operate in a reduced format; and coverage of Security Council events may be lacking. The letter notes that photos and videos may not be tagged or distributed on the same day. Translation services for the UN's main websites and official content will be limited, and some of the secretary-general's official messages will not be distributed in all of the organization's official languages. Additionally, budget constraints led to the cancellation of an innovative artificial intelligence project designed to help diplomats navigate the 80-year-old UN archives. Events outside of working hours, such as exhibition openings or events in the building's dining room, will only take place with full external funding. The financial crisis is also directly affecting the organization's research and training services. According to the document, access to the UN Digital Library resources will be limited, language learning programs will be reduced, and essential databases for experts and diplomats will be less accessible. Even the basic maintenance of the UN headquarters is affected by the cuts: heating levels will be reduced, the purchase of new equipment will be almost completely halted, and non-urgent maintenance work will be postponed until further notice. 'We will continue to monitor the cash situation and update the emergency measures in accordance with developments,' the letter said. 'However, given the severity of the crisis, it is clear that the UN is entering a period of unprecedented uncertainty, with a real impact on its ability to fulfill its mission.' Not just Trump: China is also delaying payments The UN's budget crisis stems mainly from the fact that its member states are not paying in full and on time the appropriations they themselves approved to finance the organization. A major factor in this is the U.S., after the Trump administration froze most international aid and is now not paying its share regularly. Trump also ordered withdrawal from the World Health Organization and the UN Human Rights Council, and halted all funding to UNRWA , the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees. He also ordered a review of U.S. membership in other UN organizations and its long-term participation in its activities. Trump and his designated UN ambassador, Elise Stefanik, accused the UN of being antisemitic and warned that if it did not change its ways the U.S. would withdraw from it altogether. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In recent years, China has also begun to delay its payments to the UN, and the closure of several large peacekeeping missions has exacerbated the cash crunch. As a result, the UN has been forced to take emergency measures such as postponing reimbursements to countries that contribute peacekeepers, reducing planned activities, and even shutting down certain offices as has already happened in UN offices in Geneva. The situation is particularly acute due to the UN's financial system, in which the budget is set by the General Assembly, but there is no clear penalty mechanism for countries that do not pay on time. Although the UN constitution states that a country that accumulates debt for more than two years will lose its right to vote, many countries deliberately maintain debt below this threshold. In the absence of effective sanctions, the UN is forced to rely on creative approaches to cash management – ​​which leads to a serious impairment of its ability to function properly and provide basic services to member states. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hji9ktic1g	2025-02-25T14:24:25-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/25/B1aApFjcyx/B1aApFjcyx_0_132_1000_563_0_small.jpg
Crisis with Hamas resolved: 4 dead hostages, hundreds of Palestin...	Israeli officials confirmed that agreements reached marking completion of Phase I of cease-fire deal: Hamas will transfer coffins containing 4 hostages to Egypt without a ceremony, and at the same time the prisoners will be released Israel confirmed late Tuesday night that a solution to the issue of the delay in the release of Palestinian prisoners is emerging, under which Hamas will hand over the coffins of four dead hostages to Egypt in the next 24 hours without a ceremony, and Egypt will hand over the coffins to the Red Cross to bring them to Israel. At the same time as the dead hostages are transferred, Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Earlier, Hamas announced that an agreement had been reached to resolve the crisis of the delay of the release of Palestinian prisoners, and that they would be released at the same time as the dead hostages. The announcement came after Al Jazeera reported a solution 'through the efforts of the mediators' for a one-off exchange. The Hamas-affiliated Quds Network quoted sources as saying that 'Egypt will oversee the exchange mechanism - so that Israel will be obligated to release the prisoners.' Meanwhile, the visit of Steve Witkoff , US President Donald Trump's envoy to the Middle East, which was supposed to begin in the region on Wednesday, has been postponed by several days, and the Americans are clarifying that it was actually not scheduled at all. Witkoff had stated in interviews with the U.S. media on Tuesday that he would arrive in the region this week, probably on Wednesday, and many understood that to mean that he would arrive in Israel, but this is not certain to happen at all. Israel also noted that at no point did he officially announce a visit, despite what he said to the media. The fact that Witkoff is not arriving in the region this week could reflect the crisis in the talks, but in the meantime Witkoff remains in the U.S. and is holding discussions with Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, who is serving as the head of the new negotiating team in place of Mossad head David Barnea, who was removed from the position. A senior source familiar with the details said earlier that attempts were being made to extricate Israel from the hole it had created for itself with the delay in releasing the prisoners. Hamas had refused to return the dead hostages before the prisoners, and each side entrenched itself in its position for fear of losing its achievements. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: As the 50th day of the cease-fire approaches, Israel, according to the agreement, is supposed to complete the withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor, which further complicates matters The purpose of Witkoff's arrival in the region is for discussions that are supposed to deal with the continuation of the hostage deal, and the transition to Phase II. Hamas officially made it clear above all else that it will not agree to negotiate and talk until the Palestinian prisoners are released. 'Israel's refusal to release Palestinian prisoners constitutes a serious violation of the cease-fire agreement signed by both sides through the mediators. The movement remains committed to implementing the agreement to achieve a permanent cease-fire and a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Without the release of Palestinian prisoners as stipulated in the agreement, progress on any other issue cannot be discussed,' sources in the organization accused in a conversation with the Saudi channel Asharq. On Sunday, Witkoff said that he would visit the region this week, probably on Wednesday, and that the Americans 'expect Phase II to come to fruition.' In an interview with CNN, he said that 'Netanyahu is motivated by the right reasons — Hamas cannot be part of any government in Gaza. Witkoff added: 'We first need to extend Phase I. We hope to have enough time to start Phase II and finish it in order to release as many hostages as possible and advance the talks.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1cpxascyl	2025-02-25T13:49:46-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/HJUXYCTKyx/HJUXYCTKyx_0_115_977_550_0_small.jpg

Zelensky plans to travel to US to meet Trump on minerals deal	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky plans to travel to Washington on Friday to meet U.S. President Donald Trump after officials agreed to terms on a draft minerals deal, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday. The White House declined comment. The minerals deal is central to Kyiv's push to win U.S. support as Trump seeks to rapidly end the war with Russia. Trump and Zelensky exchanged hostile words last week. Trump called Zelensky an unpopular 'dictator' who needed to cut a quick peace deal or lose his country, while the Ukrainian leader said the U.S. president was living in a 'disinformation bubble'. One of the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, told Reuters the White House had proposed the visit. Officials on both sides have agreed to the draft and advised it should be signed, the source said. The deal could open up Ukraine's vast mineral wealth to the U.S., with Trump seeking hundreds of billions of dollars to repay Washington for its support. Another source familiar with the matter said Zelensky may meet lawmakers on Capitol Hill, but that the schedule of the visit was still in flux.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjdohnjcye	2025-02-25T12:27:18-08:00	
Hamas operatives stand trial in Germany for planning European ter...	Trial opens for 4 Hamas terrorists accused of managing weapon caches across Europe for terror attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets; Authorities link their activities to plans for assaults on the Israeli embassy, Tempelhof Airport, and Ramstein Air Force Base The trial of four Hamas terrorists accused of managing secret weapon stockpiles across Europe for terror attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets began in Germany on Tuesday. Authorities suspect that the weapons were intended for attacks on the Israeli embassy in Berlin, the area surrounding Tempelhof Airport in the capital, and the U.S. Air Force base in Ramstein, Germany. German law enforcement identified the four defendants as Abd al-Hamid al-A., Mohammed B., Nazih R., and Ibrahim al-R. They were arrested in December 2023. In accordance with German privacy laws, prosecutors disclosed only their first names and the initials of their last names. The defendants are being charged with membership in a foreign terrorist organization. According to German security officials, the defendants’ activities were not directly linked to the October 7 attack in Israel, as early signs of their operations were detected months prior. However, a report in Tagesspiegel, cited by Bild, claimed the cell had been instructed to prepare weapon stockpiles for 'supportive attacks' designed to coincide with the attack on Israel. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Bild described the suspects as 'external agents,' Lebanese nationals tasked with managing weapons depots across Europe. Two of the suspects were apprehended in Berlin, while the other two were arrested in Rotterdam in December 2023. They have been held in custody since their arrests. According to Bild, initial information about the cell came from a 'foreign intelligence service.' Following the arrests, German officials noted that Mossad announced international cooperation had led to the exposure of Hamas’s European terror network. As part of the investigation, German police raided five locations, including Ibrahim al-R.’s apartment in central Berlin and a restaurant in the city. The indictment states that the defendants acted on behalf of Hamas over an extended period and were under the direct command of the organization’s military wing. According to Bild, the terror network’s activities began in the spring of 2019, when Ibrahim al-R. established a weapons depot in Bulgaria containing ammunition and firearms, including an AK-47. In the summer of the same year, he cleared a weapons cache in Denmark and smuggled a handgun into Germany. Reports indicate the cell received direct orders from the deputy commander of Hamas’ military wing in Lebanon, 'Abu Khaled,' who was assassinated by Israel in southern Lebanon in November 2023. The cell also attempted to find a location to store weapons in Poland but was unsuccessful. The trial is being held in Berlin’s most secure courtroom, Room 142. The space is completely sealed, windowless, equipped with an independent ventilation system, blocks cellular transmissions and is accessed via winding corridors. Defendants are seated in separate bulletproof glass enclosures, while the audience and journalists are separated from the judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys and witnesses by similar glass partitions. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1md25o9kg	2025-02-25T12:23:52-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/25/rkfBPSiq1x/rkfBPSiq1x_400_268_2358_1328_0_small.jpg
Publicly funded CUNY seeks Palestinian Studies professor to teach...	Posting for Hunter College comes amid growing concerns over antisemitism within the CUNY system; listing explicitly calls for 'a historically grounded scholar who takes a critical lens to issues pertaining to Palestine including but not limited to: settler colonialism, genocide, human rights, apartheid, migration, climate and infrastructure devastation, health, race, gender and sexuality' In a move that has sparked outrage among Jewish groups and pro-Israel activists, Hunter College, a publicly funded institution within the City University of New York (CUNY) system, has posted a job listing for a professorship in Palestinian Studies. The listing explicitly calls for 'a historically grounded scholar who takes a critical lens to issues pertaining to Palestine including but not limited to: settler colonialism, genocide, human rights, apartheid, migration, climate and infrastructure devastation, health, race, gender and sexuality'– all within the context of Palestine. Critics argue that the job posting is not an academic initiative but rather an attempt to institutionalize anti-Israel rhetoric under the guise of higher education. The listing, part of a 'Palestinian Studies cluster hire,' seeks a candidate to join the one or more of the departments of Anthropology, History, Sociology, Political Science or Women’s and Gender Studies. While the job description claims openness to diverse theoretical and methodological approaches, opponents argue that the focus areas are inherently biased and promote a singular, hostile narrative against Israel. Hunter College’s posting comes amid growing concerns over antisemitism within the CUNY system. An independent investigation commissioned by New York Governor Kathy Hochul last year found widespread instances of antisemitic incidents across CUNY campuses, including harassment of Jewish students and faculty, glorification of Hamas, and administrative inaction against hate speech. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The controversy surrounding the job posting is the latest in a series of antisemitism-related scandals at CUNY. In January, CUNY’s faculty union, the Professional Staff Congress, approved a resolution to divest from Israel over the war in Gaza. Following public backlash, the resolution was overturned. Similarly, past graduation ceremonies have featured speakers who delivered virulently anti-Israel speeches, further cementing CUNY’s reputation as a hotbed for anti-Zionist and antisemitic rhetoric. Hunter College, in a statement, attempted to downplay concerns, saying, 'Hunter College has zero tolerance for hate of any kind. Our current and future faculty are expected to be well-versed in all scholarship so they can dissect and debunk theories, not promote them.' However, critics remain unconvinced, pointing to the specific language of the job listing and the college’s history of tacitly endorsing anti-Israel activism. Hochul’s executive budget proposal includes $2.25 billion in operating funds for CUNY’s 25 schools for the upcoming fiscal year, as well as $1.8 billion for capital construction and maintenance. The controversy over Hunter College’s hiring decision raises questions over whether taxpayer dollars should be used to fund what many consider to be state-sponsored antisemitism. Critics are urging Hochul to take decisive action, warning that the longer antisemitism festers within CUNY, the more difficult it will be to reverse course. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s15j11jj9ye	2025-02-25T12:16:02-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/05/22/B1TnYIwPc/B1TnYIwPc_457_31_1367_770_0_small.jpg
Freed hostage in 1st social media post recalls slain captive Ori ...	Ori Danino courageously returned during the Nova attack to rescue Omer Shem Tov and Maya and Itay Regev; He was kidnapped and later killed by Hamas, but his actions saved their lives; Shem Tov honors Ori’s memory and heroism, thanks soldiers for fighting for him and other hostages Ori Danino, who was murdered in a tunnel alongside five other hostages, had already begun fleeing the Nova festival on October 7 but decided to return to save Omer Shem Tov, Maya Regev and Itay Regev. Danino and his friend each fled to their cars, but during the escape, the friend saw Ori turning back and received a message from him. Ori asked for the phone numbers of Maya, Itay and Omer. 'This isn’t the time to be a hero,' the friend told him, but Ori replied: 'I’ll be fine, I need to bring them home.' 'Ori, it’s because of you that I’m here,' Shem Tov wrote on Tuesday in his first long post since his release last Saturday. 'Ori Danino, whom I met only a few hours before the party, arrived with a bright light and incredible energy. A few hours later, amid the chaos, he appeared like an angel, without hesitating for a moment. I have no words to thank you. May your memory be blessed.' Shem Tov wrote a post on Instagram alongside a photo of himself putting on tefillin. 'To our heroic soldiers – I was there, I heard you fighting, fighting for us, doing everything to bring us home. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. May the memory of all the heroes who fell be blessed.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He added: 'The people of Israel – there is no nation like ours, and there never will be! I saw you fighting for us, and it gave me the strength to believe I would come home. I felt your prayers, and even in the darkness, I had light.' Like the other returning hostages, who have emphasized the urgency and supreme importance of bringing back the 63 hostages still left behind, Shem Tov has also joined the fight: 'Now I’m here to raise the voices of those still there. It’s a duty to bring them home—the living, for recovery, and the fallen, for burial. I love each and every one of you! Am Yisrael Chai.' Ori managed to locate Omer and the Regev siblings, but Hamas terrorists stopped the vehicle, and the four were kidnapped to Gaza. Maya and Itay Regev were released in the hostage deal in November 2023. Ori was one of six hostages murdered in a Hamas tunnel in August. On Saturday, with the return of Omer Shem Tov home, Ori’s mission was completed: he saved all three of them. 'We feel that the circle has closed, and we’re happy for Omer,' Rabbi Elhanan Danino, Ori’s father, told Ynet following the release. 'We know Ori wouldn’t have acted any differently — that’s just who he was. When we were told this a few days later, we weren’t surprised. That’s Ori. He already told me that dying for the country would be the greatest honor for him. We know he went there consciously. We live with the loss in deep pain — it’s our loss. But when we think about what he wanted in life, we understand that he always saw the lives of others before his own. My solace, at least as an adult and a believer, is that this was his will.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkm8otocje	2025-02-25T10:54:11-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/25/rksr00Ns5Je/rksr00Ns5Je_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Ukraine attacks Israel after its UN sovereignty vote aligns with ...	Israel’s vote against Ukraine’s sovereignty resolution at the UN has drawn sharp criticism from Ukraine; Ukraine's ambassador to Israel expressed disappointment; 'Knesset members and ordinary citizens say how ashamed they are of this vote' A day after Israel's dramatic vote at the UN General Assembly against the Ukraine-initiated resolution that calls for preserving its sovereignty and territorial integrity, Ukraine's ambassador to Israel expressed sharp criticism. 'I constantly receive phone calls from Israeli ministers, Knesset members, and ordinary citizens who say how ashamed they are of this vote,' said Ambassador Yevgen Korniychuk. Israel joined the United States in voting against the resolution —a first for both nations since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war. The resolution, which was overwhelmingly approved by 93 countries, also calls for halting hostilities and pursuing a peaceful resolution to the war between Russia and Ukraine. The unusual vote followed a dramatic shift in US policy regarding the war, after President Donald Trump harshly criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and effectively adopted Russia's stance. Shortly after the UN vote, Trump stated during a press conference at the White House alongside French President Emmanuel Macron that he is focusing on achieving a cease-fire agreement between Russia and Ukraine 'as quickly as possible.' He added that the U.S. has held 'several excellent conversations' with Russia since his inauguration last month. Ukraine was stunned by Israel's decision. Korniychuk issued a statement noting: 'On February 24, 2025, three years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation, the General Assembly adopted the resolution 'Promoting a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine.' Supported by 93 countries, the document reaffirms Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and calls for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on the UN Charter.' The ambassador also reiterated that he continues to receive calls from Israeli officials embarrassed by the vote, adding, 'Unfortunately, Israel is among the 18 nations that opposed supporting fundamental principles of truth and democracy. I want to thank the people of Israel who supported Ukraine three years ago and continue to stand with us today. I repeatedly emphasize that the people of Ukraine and Israel are one big family that feels each other's pain. This makes it so difficult to understand the position of Israeli officials — a country at war after being attacked without provocation, a country that, like Ukraine, fights for its right to exist.' Up until the final moments before the vote, Israel was unsure of the United States’ stance and whether it would indeed vote against the resolution. Israel aligned with the U.S. but was among only a handful of nations to do so — joined by allies like Hungary and Pacific Island nations. North Korea and Russia also opposed the resolution. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Since the war's onset, Israel has supported Ukraine's territorial integrity and even attempted to mediate between Ukraine and Russia. Former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett flew to Moscow on a Saturday in May 2022 to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Throughout the conflict, Israel sided with Ukraine and provided it with assistance, primarily in the form of protective equipment such as helmets, vests and gas masks. Israel also transferred its Red Alert rocket warning system to Ukraine, and the two nations have exchanged intelligence on Iranian aid to Russia, particularly regarding the supply of attack drones. At the same time, Ukraine has expected Israel to step up its support by providing offensive weapons, a demand Israel has refrained from fulfilling due to concerns about provoking Russia's anger, which has caused significant disappointment in Ukraine. Recent reports suggested that Israel transferred Patriot defense systems to Ukraine, but it was later clarified that the systems were handed to the U.S., which then delivered them to Ukraine. Public opinion in Ukraine has sympathized with Israel following the October 7 massacre and, generally, the country has felt a shared sense of destiny with Israel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjbh000o9jg	2025-02-25T10:25:40-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/09/20/r1lcK2ROk6/r1lcK2ROk6_1_66_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

220-pound bomb attack against IDF forces in northern West Bank fo...	Shin Bet and IDF announce the arrest of a terror cell and seizure of its powerful bomb in the northern West Bank town of Qabatiya; arrests came after a tip from two terrorists arrested last month in Nablus who were on their way to carry out a shooting attack in Huwara using M-16 rifles The Shin Bet announced Tuesday evening that it had foiled a shooting attack in Huwara planned by a terrorist cell, and at the same time thwarted an attack on IDF forces in the northern West Bank using a 100-kg (220-pound) bomb. A joint statement with the IDF noted that Shin Bet operational unit fighters, Yamam -National Counter-Terrorism soldiers, and Shomron Brigade soldiers arrested terrorists Ahmed Ali Zakharna and Tariq Abu Zeid on January 11 in Nablus, who were traveling in their vehicle on their way to carry out a shooting attack. Two M-16 rifles were seized from their possession. During their interrogation by the Shin Bet, it emerged that the two were on their way to carry out a shooting attack in Huwara, and that terrorist operatives from the Jenin Battalion had received a 100-kg (220-pound) bomb, which they wanted to use against IDF forces. In light of the information received during the interrogation, additional operatives from the cell were arrested Monday night in a joint operation by the IDF and Shin Bet in the city of Qabatiya in the northern West Bank, who were in possession of weapons and the powerful 100-kg bomb. At the same time, soldiers from the Nahal Brigade, who in recent days joined the counterterrorism operation in the northern West Bank, operated under the direction of the Shin Bet in Qabatiya, Silat al-Harithiya, and Al-Yamun. The forces searched dozens of terrorist infrastructures, arrested 15 terrorists, located weapons, and destroyed explosives, including the bomb.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1u4kto5kx	2025-02-25T09:06:02-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/25/BkmTYdjcJl/BkmTYdjcJl_0_200_480_271_0_small.jpg
Syria calls for Israel's withdrawal from its lands, national dial...	Syria condemned on Tuesday Israel's incursion into its territories and called for Israel to withdraw, according to a the closing statement of a national dialogue summit organised by Syria's new Islamist rulers to outline the country's political roadmap. Israel moved forces into a U.N.-monitored demilitarized zone within Syria after rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former Al-Qaida affiliate, toppled former President Bashar al-Assad in December. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel will not tolerate the presence of HTS in southern Syria, nor any other forces affiliated with the country's new rulers, and demanded the territory be demilitarized.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkas7yic1x	2025-02-25T08:52:45-08:00	
Countries tell Ukraine 'you are not alone' after UN adopts neutra...	Dozens of countries rallied behind Ukraine at a meeting at the United Nations in Geneva on Tuesday, a day after the U.N. Security Council adopted a U.S.-drafted resolution that takes a neutral stance on the conflict. The event, held to commemorate 'resistance to the Russian aggression,' follows the resolution adopted in New York on the war's third anniversary that reflects President Donald Trump's upending of U.S. policy on Ukraine and his more conciliatory stance toward Russia. 'You are not alone. Norway and other countries, all the countries who are here, but also other countries, will continue to support you as you fight for your territorial integrity, your sovereignty and your human dignity,' Norway's Deputy Foreign Minister Andreas Motzfeldt Kravik told a packed room of ministers and diplomats. The U.S. failed to convince the U.N. General Assembly to pass the same resolution that passed in the Security Council on Monday. The General Assembly instead adopted motions seen as more favorable for Ukraine, in a diplomatic victory over Washington.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjx5gks5jx	2025-02-25T08:50:30-08:00	
Shin Bet foiled 100-kg bomb attack against IDFG forces in West Ba...	Last month, the Shin Bet and security forces arrested several terrorist cells from Qabatia, near Jenin, who were planning to carry out significant attacks. On January 11, the forces arrested Ahmed Ali Zakharna and Tariq Abu Zeid in Nablus while they were traveling to carry out an attack, and two M16 weapons were seized from them. Their interrogation revealed that they were on their way to carry out a shooting attack in Huwara and had received a 100-kilogram bomb from terrorist operatives from the Jenin Battalion that they wanted to use against IDF forces in the West Bank. In light of the information, additional operatives from the cell were arrested, and weapons and a powerful 100-kilogram explosive device were seized.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry9wausckl	2025-02-25T08:26:36-08:00	
Until Avinatan returns my heart is in captivity': Noa Argamani p...	She is the first hostage to survive captivity to speak before the international body and she demanded that all stages of the cease-fire deal be implemented to save her partner Avinatan Or and the 62 other hostages who remain in captivity; 'They are in absolute hell, abandoned by the world. Don't let the darkness last forever!' Rescued hostage Noa Argamani spoke to the UN Security Council on Wednesday evening, becoming the first Gaza hostage to survive captivity to speak to the council since the outbreak of the wa. In her remarks, she called on the international community to act more vigorously to free the 63 hostages who remain held in captivity in Gaza, and she also described some of the horrors she herself endured in captivity, until she was rescued in Operation Arnon last year. Argamani demanded that all stages of the cease-fire and hostage release deal be implemented, and warned that the hostages, including her partner Avinatan Or, have no more time left. 'Until Avinatan returns, my heart is in captivity,' she said. 'My name is Noa Argamani. I was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists on October 7 from the Nova Festival along with my boyfriend, Avinatan Or. We were taken to Gaza by force, separated, and entered hell on earth. I held Avinatan's hand as long as I could, but in one moment of terror – we were torn apart from each other and dragged into the unknown.' 'After eight months in captivity, I was rescued by the Israeli soldiers. Being here today is a miracle, but I’m here today to tell you we have no time. As I speak, there are still 63 hostages living in a nightmare, including my partner Avinatan,' Argamani said in her opening remarks. 'Our lives cannot go [on] without them. That's why I need to make sure the world knows this,' she tells the council. 'The deal must go on in its entirety, in all its stages. My partner and many other hostages are only supposed to be released in the second stage of the deal. We are talking about innocent people who were taken from their beds, from a music festival, from their simple lives – to a hellish hell,' she added. She referred in her remarks to the shocking murder of Shiri Bibs and her children Ariel and Kfir, whose bodies were returned last week as part of the deal and will be laid to rest tomorrow. 'You don't need me to tell you about a 9-month-old baby, Kfir, and his 4-year-old brother, Ariel Bibas, and their mother Shiri. A mother and her infants who were brutally murdered in captivity. They didn't die in battle. They weren't soldiers. They were tender children, whose blood was spilled with unimaginable brutality. This crime is unspeakable, we can't imagine it, but it happened. And that's why we can't leave anyone there. This is Hamas – an organization that crushes babies with its hands and celebrates death. 'I know what it feels like to be left behind, to see other hostages being released. Every moment feels like the last moment of their lives, every second counts. When I was in Gaza, I was held with two little girls, Hila Rotem and Emily Hand. Emily was 8 years old at the time and Hila was 12. I had to be brave, not only for myself but also for the girls. I had to act as if everything would be okay, which is why I told them, 'As long as we are here, together, alive in this room – nothing else matters.'' She said: 'I told them to ignore all the booms, the gunshots and everything else around us. Hila and Emily were both released in the first deal after 50 days. I saw them and two other women who were with me in captivity return home to their families while I stayed behind. I was not part of any category that I could be released under. I can't even begin to describe the feeling of being left behind, but I can say – this is exactly what the kidnapped feel today. Abandoned by the world.' She also described the bombing of the building where she was later held along with hostages Itay Svirsky and Yossi Sharabi. 'After 54 days in captivity, only I, Itay Svirsky and Yossi Sharabi were left. Both were kidnapped from their homes in Kibbutz Be'eri. We were in a war zone 24/7. It was horrific, every day, every second. One evening, the house where we were being held was bombed, and we found ourselves buried under the rubble. Itay managed to get up, but Yossi and I were trapped beneath piles of concrete. I couldn't move. I couldn't breathe. I was drawn into darkness and thought this was it, these were the last seconds of my life. I screamed with all my might for someone to hear me, and I also heard Yossi's screams. Screams of pain, of pleading, of a person trapped between life and death. And then, after a few seconds, I heard only silence. Yossi died next to me, alone, helpless.' 'I pulled myself out of the rubble and tried to help Yossi, but it was too late. Yossi was a close friend of mine, he was a pure soul and will remain in my heart forever. Itay and I were forced to look for another place to hide, so one of our captors took us to another house, but two days later Itay was murdered by the same captor. Itay was with me from the first day in captivity, we told each other everything, he was my soulmate. May their memory be a blessing.' 'Hamas released a video of me describing what happened to Itai and Yossi and that I was injured and needed medical help, but of course I received nothing: no doctors, no Red Cross, nothing. From that moment on, I was alone with five terrorists holding me in the same house. You have to understand – every second in captivity is very dangerous. I didn’t think I would survive. That’s why it’s absolutely critical that we put an end to this terrible tragedy. Without immediate action, many more innocent lives will end – including my partner Avinatan. Until Avinatan returns, my heart is in captivity.' At the end of her speech, she told the ambassadors of the Security Council member states: 'I came to speak to you to say - don't let the darkness win! Work to bring everyone home now, work for the light and against the darkness. I came to speak to the Security Council today because I believe that all of you, the international community, must understand that the kidnapped are in hell. And after losing so many friends, I can say that they deserve to come home now. What kept me alive in captivity until this moment was something my mother used to tell me - always be nice to others. So in this forum, let me finish with this - be kind to each other, and please return everyone, bring them home now.'

In recent months, she has been working to return the hostages at various international events, and most recently attended an event in Miami commemorating the Nova party massacre , alongside President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon, who initiated bringing Argamani to the Security Council, said: 'We thank Noa for being here today, but she would not have been here today if the international community and this Council had acted against Hamas instead of looking the other way and remaining silent. The world must understand: Our hostages are living in hell on earth. They have no hope without action. It is time to make a decision to unequivocally condemn Hamas. They must return home now and we will return them home.' Danon added: 'Through the story of Noa, the Bibas family and many others, the world has been exposed to the depth of Hamas' inhumanity. It is time to recognize that Hamas has no place in Gaza's future. It is time to put an end to the games. Hamas does not deserve to be a party to any negotiations. The world must act decisively, allow the return of the kidnapped and ensure that this terrorist apparatus is wiped out once and for all.' 'For months, Hamas has psychologically tortured families, played with them, and kept them in cruel uncertainty,' Danon said. 'There is no other place in the world where parents go to sleep without knowing whether their children are alive or dead and the international community stands by. It is time to finally make a decision to unequivocally condemn Hamas. This should have happened 16 months ago, but better late than never.

The entire country is on high alert': Iran braces for joint US-I...	Fearing attack, Iran has heightened its defense readiness, deploying additional missile systems; Concerns grow as reports suggest Israel is preparing for significant attacks, with US support in the form of intelligence and aerial refueling Apprehension is mounting within the Islamic Republic due to a possible joint US-Israeli strike on their nuclear facilities, and the Iranian regime has elevated alert levels on its missile defense systems and reinforced defenses around key nuclear sites. Reports from the British Telegraph, citing senior officials in Tehran, indicate that additional air defense launchers have been deployed near critical missile sites as part of these heightened security measures. These steps are reportedly a response to growing fears of coordinated military action by Israel and the United States. Approximately two weeks ago, reports from the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post revealed that U.S. intelligence assessments suggest Israel is contemplating 'significant strikes' on nuclear facilities in Fordow and Natanz, potentially as early as the first half of 2025. The timing aligns with the transition between the end of the Biden administration and the early days of the Trump administration. 'Iranian authorities are bracing for an attack and expect it to occur at any night in the near future. The entire country is on high alert, even at sites whose existence is unknown to most,' a source told the Telegraph. 'Efforts to strengthen nuclear sites have been ongoing for years but have intensified over the past year, particularly since Israel’s first strike. Recent developments, including President Trump’s statements and reports of his potential plans to target Iran have only accelerated these activities.' Since the outbreak of hostilities, Israel and Iran have exchanged direct attacks, but Tehran now fears that, with President Donald Trump’s support, Israel is nearing a decisive strike on its nuclear facilities. According to the Wall Street Journal, a summary of the intelligence report noted that Israel is likely to pressure Trump’s administration for backing, as it views Trump as more inclined to join such an operation than Biden. A source speaking to the Telegraph acknowledged Iran’s vulnerability to a large-scale attack, particularly as its defense systems were weakened by an Israeli strike last year. 'Additional air defense launchers have been deployed, but there’s an understanding that they may not withstand a large-scale assault,' the source explained. Satellite images have revealed damage caused by Israeli strikes on sites such as the Shahroud Space Center in northern Iran’s Semnan province, used for launches by the Revolutionary Guards. These strikes were part of Operation 'Days of Repentance, three waves of Israeli strikes against 20 locations in Iran and other locations in Iraq, and Syria on October 26, 2024. The Ayatollah regime has developed domestic defense systems and possesses Russian-made S-300 missile launchers. However, the Telegraph noted these systems are considered insufficient to defend against Israel’s advanced military capabilities, thus prompting Iran to pressure Russia to expedite the delivery of the S-400 air defense system. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the Revolutionary Guards’ Aerospace Force, announced this week that Iran is also developing a ballistic missile defense system to counter Israeli strikes. 'Recent events have exposed gaps in our ballistic defense sector, highlighting the need for this new system,' he stated. The defense system is expected to be operational by March and deployed in Tehran and several major cities. 'We currently have the capability to produce missiles with a range of 1,240 miles and face no technical limitations in this regard. Should there be a threat from the US, we can target nearby objectives at minimal cost,' he claimed. The weakening of Iran’s proxies, such as Hamas and Hezbollah, along with the fall of Assad’s regime in Syria, has further strained Tehran’s position, making it more vulnerable to Trump’s policies. Since returning to the White House, Trump has reinstated his 'maximum pressure' campaign against Iran, aiming to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons and reducing Iranian oil exports 'to zero.' This week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that, with Trump’s support, Israel would 'finish the job' with Iran. However, analysts suggest Israel is unlikely to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program without U.S. assistance. In recent months, Trump has repeatedly expressed a preference for negotiating a deal with Iran but has also made it clear that military action remains on the table if talks fail. An Iranian official told the Telegraph that there is growing concern in Tehran that 'the U.S. might join Israel in launching a large-scale attack that could threaten the very existence of the Islamic Republic.' Earlier Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, after meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, stated that Tehran would not negotiate under threats or pressure. 'There will be no direct talks with the U.S. as long as the ‘maximum pressure’ policy continues,' he declared. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Jason Brodsky, policy director at the United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) organization, told the Telegraph that there are several ways the U.S. could support Israel in a strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities. 'The U.S. could provide political backing, assist with intelligence reconnaissance and aerial refueling, or supply advanced weaponry to destroy the nuclear program,' he explained. 'There’s always the possibility that the U.S. could directly participate in the strikes alongside Israel,' Brodsky added. 'The Iranian regime is fatigued and is considering all these possibilities. Its anxiety has grown due to American media reports and intelligence assessments indicating that Israel is preparing to strike Iran’s nuclear program.' Iran is now exploring ways to revive the 2015 nuclear agreement, which Trump withdrew from in 2018, while the U.S. continues to push for Tehran’s complete disarmament. 'As long as both sides cling to such opposing demands, a diplomatic resolution is unlikely,' Brodsky stated. 'This will require the U.S. to exert significant pressure, a strategy that the Trump administration has already begun implementing.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjcyxli9jg	2025-02-25T07:33:53-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/01/13/H1QGO3w6hK/H1QGO3w6hK_0_0_1300_867_0_small.jpg
BBC launches internal probe after Gaza-based cameraman posts supp...	Hatem Rawagh participated in the production of the documentary 'Gaza: How to Survive in a War Zone', now under fire after the public broadcaster failed to inform viewers its main protagonist was the son of a senior member of Hamas The BBC launched an internal review after being exposed to tweets by Hatem Rawagh, a Gaza-based cameraman who shared posts on his social media platforms praising the Hamas massacre of Oct. 7. He was part of the team that filmed the Documentary 'Gaza: How to Survive in a War Zone,' which has caused outrage. The film features as one of its main protagonists, Abdullah al-Yazouri, but failed to mention that he was the son of a senior member of the terror group who served as a minister in the Hamas government. The BBC later apologized. Rawagh in one post compared the Hamas massacre to the Egyptian defeat in the 1973 Yom Kippur war. 'If you missed October 6 in Egypt, October 7 is happening in Palestine,' he wrote. He also posted a clip filmed by the Hamas military wing, showing an attack on the Erez border crossing with Israel and wrote 'return to view this clip a million times.' In another post, Rawagh showed celebrations in the Omari mosque in Gaza after a ramming attack in Tel Aviv killed an Italian tourist and injured seven other people. 'The celebratory atmosphere in the Omari Mosque in Gaza when the news of the operation in Tel Aviv arrives,' he wrote. The BBC announced it would temporarily remove the documentary from its digital platforms and said it would be conducting further due diligence with the production company. 'The film remains a powerful child's eye view of the devastating consequences of the war in Gaza which we believe is an invaluable testament to their experiences, and we must meet our commitment to transparency,' the British public broadcaster said in a statement.

Fifth of Israelis displaced by war out of work, survey shows	One-fifth of Israelis who were forced to evacuate their homes after the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack have lost their jobs, the Israel Democracy Institute said on Tuesday, underlining the broader cost to the Israeli economy from the war in Gaza. Tens of thousands of Israelis were evacuated from towns near the Gaza and Lebanese borders following the attacks, which were immediately followed by missile barrages from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement in southern Lebanon. Most spent months living in temporary accommodation across Israel, helped by government subsidies that added to the billions of dollars spent on the military during the war, but away from their jobs and livelihoods. Just over a third (39%), had returned to their homes, according to the survey, conducted in December and January by the non-partisan IDI think tank, while most of the areas in the north that were subjected to months of Hezbollah bombardment were still deserted. But 19% of those in employment before the war were out of work when the survey was conducted, according to the survey by the IDI, highlighting the cost to an economy that grew by just 1% in 2024. Another 3% were called in to reserve military duty. Around a third of Israeli households have reported a fall in their incomes since the start of the war, a proportion that reached as high as 44% among households in the north, where economic activity in businesses, tourism and the agricultural sector was severely impacted. The Bank of Israel said in October that the sharp slowdown on economic activity in northern areas of Israel as a result of the war would add to the pressures on an economy already squeezed by higher spending on defense and a shortage of labour in key sectors including construction.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkhfspocke	2025-02-25T07:12:49-08:00

Mossad head speaks for first time about Hezbollah pager operation...	David Barnea in rare speech reveals new details from the exploding pager op, explaining why it was not activated and the beginning of the war; 'A clear line can be drawn in the war in the north from the exploding pagers to the elimination of Nasrallah to the cease-fire agreement' For the first time since the outbreak of war in the October 7 massacre , Mossad head David Barnea spoke publicly on Tuesday and provided new details about the exploding pagers operation targeting Hezbollah terrorists. At the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) conference, Barnea called the exploding pager operation against Hezbollah, 'a clear example of the realization of our mission.' He pointed out that the Mossad's emblem is inscribed with this verse from Proverbs, which states that: 'Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety.' In light of this verse, Barnea explained, 'the Mossad is realizing its mission for the security of the state and its citizens. The pager operation was creatively planned by Mossad employees, using ingenuity and cunning.' 'It expresses intelligence penetration and a deep understanding of the adversary, technological superiority and first-rate operational capabilities,' the Mossad chief added. The operation, he noted, symbolizes the 'turning point' in the war in the north, and 'the starting point for the 10 days during which the tide turned against our enemies. A clear line can be drawn in the war in the north from the exploding pagers to the elimination of Nasrallah to the cease-fire agreement.' According to Barnea, 'Operation Pagers is a young operation, compared to Operation Walkie-Talkie, which was launched the next day. Operation Walkie-Talkie was developed about a decade ago, back during Tamir Pardo's time (2011-2016), and continued during Yossi Cohen's time (2016-2021). The idea for Operation Pagers first came up when we realized that Operation Walkie-Talkie was not effective in all combat situations. Therefore, we thought of another way to harm Hezbollah terrorists - by detonating a device that was always attached to their bodies.' 'The first infrastructure for the operation was established in late 2022, and the first shipment to Lebanon, containing only 500 pagers, arrived just weeks before the terrible massacre of October 7,' he said. 'At that time, thousands of radios from the long-standing operation were mostly stored in Hezbollah warehouses. Launching the two operations at the beginning of the war would not have resulted in the powerful battlefield achievement that we achieved at the time of its launch.' He noted that, by the time the operation was ultimately launched, '10 times more beepers were detonated than we had at the beginning of the war and twice as many radios.' According to him, 'the dilemma in launching the operation on September 17, 2024, was great, very great. In the discussion of approving the operation, two schools of thought were presented, both of which were correct at the time they were presented. The prime minister ultimately made the decision in complete opposition to the prevailing position in the discussion, and here we are receiving the award.' He emphasized that 'the day when thousands of beepers exploded in the hands of Hezbollah terrorists will be remembered as the turning point in the war. It is the day when the power of the ruse exceeded the power of kinetics. The amount of explosives in all the thousands of devices combined did not exceed the amount of explosives found in one standard mine. But the impact on morale was powerful.' Barnea added that the severe blow suffered by the Shiite terrorist organization in Lebanon 'broke its spirit. Victory in war is not measured by the number of dead or the number of missiles destroyed, but by victory over the spirit, morale and motivation of the enemy.' He said that Hezbollah is 'Iran's execution arm on our northern border,' and that 'the Mossad has been preparing for the third Lebanon War since 2006.' 'We have collected intimate and unique intelligence over many years, and we have strengthened cooperation with the Military Intelligence Service in a wide variety of operational and intelligence activities,' Barnea said. 'We initiated and planned operations and special capabilities in enemy territory and, most importantly, we understood that the next war will be different from the previous wars we have known.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He praised the work of Mossad personnel. 'The Mossad does not have tanks or armored personnel carriers, we do not have fighter jets or missiles - the men and women of the Mossad are the engine of its work and its successes,' he said. 'They are the creative minds that make the impossible possible. They are the fighters, the special operations forces, the technology, intelligence and cyber personnel who create superiority on the battlefield. They are the ones who devise the strategy. Thanks to them, the Mossad faces many threats and challenges every day, and is able to do so.' As part of his speech, Barnea emphasized that 'above all our commitment is to return home all the hostages, living and dead.' According to him, 'it is the supreme moral imperative to return our brothers and sisters from the infernal tunnels.' Barnea referred to the return of the hostages as part of the cease-fire deal, for which he led the negotiations on Phase I, and added that the moments of reunion with their loved ones 'express the fulfillment of the greatest Jewish and moral duty - of redeeming captives. There is no more sublime feeling, not even during the implementation of a high-impact operation, that would be comparable to the sense of value and mission of returning the hostages. This sacred mission has been before my eyes since October 7. We will continue to act until everyone returns home.' The pager operation was launched on September 17, 2024, amid fears that it would soon be discovered. On the first day of the operation, the pagers of Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon and Syria exploded - and the next day, on September 18, their walkie-talkies also exploded. The explosions of the pagers and walkie-talkies killed about 30 people and injured about 3,000. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s11dolsqye	2025-02-25T06:43:49-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/18/S100cJ8dpA/S100cJ8dpA_102_0_2899_1999_0_small.jpg
Syrians hold 'historic' national dialogue amid concerns over tran...	Syria has a 'historic opportunity' to build itself anew, its interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa said on Tuesday, addressing a national dialogue summit billed by Syria's Islamist rulers as a key milestone after decades of Assad-family rule. Hundreds of Syrians met at the presidential palace in Damascus for the one-day event, hailed by proponents as unprecedented but which critics fear may be window dressing for a transition process steered heavily by Syria's new leaders. The country's political roadmap remains broadly undefined, save for a new transitional government set to take power on March 1, whose members have yet to be announced. Sharaa, facing calls from Western and Arab countries to lead an inclusive process, has said elections would take up to five years to hold. Participants divided into six working groups to discuss a transitional justice system; the constitution; building state institutions; personal freedoms; Syria's future economic model and the role civil society would have in the country. The discussions were confidential, with a moderator allocating two minutes to participants to speak and restrictions on removing any documents from the summit hall. Organizers say the recommendations set to be agreed by the end of the day will help shape a constitutional declaration intended to lay out the basic principles for Syria's new governing order. They will be considered by the new transitional government. Proponents say the process is a notable shift from decades of autocratic rule by the Assad family, when political dissent was often met with detention in a labyrinthine prison system. The summit will be closely watched by Arab and Western capitals alike, which have conditioned full ties with Syria's new leaders - including the possible lifting of sanctions - on whether the political process is inclusive of Syria's ethnically and religiously diverse population, three diplomats said. Syria-based diplomats were not invited to the conference, three foreign envoys in the country said. Its organisers did not take up offers by the United Nations to help with the summit. The U.N., the United States and other countries have imposed sanctions on HTS as a group. The U.S. and the European Union also have widespread sanctions in place on Syria, but have issued temporary lifts on some sectors in recent weeks. Speaking after Sharaa, Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani criticised international sanctions still in place, saying they were being used 'as a means of pressure on the will of the Syrian people.' Following his comments, a woman in attendance stood up and shouted, 'Thank God, the People's Palace has returned to the people!'

Rima Hassan was banned from entering Israel, but her visit was ap...	Hassan, a vocal critic of Israel, was expelled from the country despite the Foreign Ministry approving her visit two months ago; Gideon Saar's office says he had no knowledge of the European Parliament delegation's arrival A day after the European Parliament delegation headed by Rima Hassan was denied entry to Israel, reports on Tuesday said the Foreign Ministry had approved the delegation’s visit two months earlier despite accusations in Israel that she supports Hamas. The Interior Ministry had blocked Hassan’s entry while she was already on a flight from Brussels, following a recommendation from the Diaspora Affairs and Antisemitism Ministry. Hassan landed at Ben Gurion Airport with the delegation but was denied entry due to her anti-Israel activism, including support for a boycott of Israel. Hassan wrote on her X account that the Foreign Ministry had approved the delegation’s composition and schedule in January. She noted that the move came while Foreign Minister Gideon Saar was in Brussels meeting European Parliament President Roberta Metsola and EU foreign ministers in the long-dormant Association Council forum. 'The pro-Israel trolls lie just as much as the genocidal state they defend,' she wrote. 'Not only was Rima Hassan rejected, but an entire official delegation from the European Parliament was prevented from carrying out its mission in the occupied Palestinian territories and we all know why. 'Israel’s self-centeredness is as infuriating as its propaganda. Passing through its airport was a necessity but our mission was solely in Palestinian territories. It’s time for the EU to act. It’s common for Israel to block parliamentary missions. It has barred UN experts, international NGOs and even the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor.' 'Foreign Minister Gideon Saar was unaware of Rima Hassan’s request to enter Israel and did not approve it,' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. 'When he learned of it yesterday, he clarified that her entry would violate a recent amendment to the Entry into Israel Law and should be denied.' Foreign Ministry Director-General Eden Bar-Tal ordered an investigation into the circumstances of Hassan’s request. 'Given Hassan’s antisemitic views and support for Hamas, her complaints about Israel only highlight her audacity and reinforce her status as a hostile figure,' the ministry said. Hassan, a French citizen born in the Palestinian refugee camp of Nayrab in Syria, identifies as Palestinian and is considered one of Israel’s fiercest critics in the European Parliament. She claims to have condemned 'Hamas’ war crimes' but refuses to 'turn that natural empathy into support for Israel.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In an official statement, she detailed the delegation’s planned meetings with EU diplomats, UN agencies, the Palestinian Authority, civil organizations and Palestinians affected by what she called Israel’s 'colonial and ethnic cleansing policies.' She accused Israel of a last-minute reversal. 'Banning members of an official European Parliament delegation, including its president and administrative staff, is an attack on EU institutions. This mission was approved by Israeli authorities, who had the participant list and itinerary for two months.' Hassan also criticized the EU for holding the Association Council meeting despite calls to suspend the agreement over 'Israel’s war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank.' She vowed to 'keep defending Palestinian rights and pushing for sanctions on Israel as long as it violates them.' She referenced former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant’s claim that 40,000 Palestinians had been evacuated from refugee camps in Jenin, Tulkarm and Nur Shams as part of an IDF operation. 'Was Israel afraid we’d witness mass expulsions by its army or see tanks entering Jenin? Israel wants to prevent lawmakers from seeing the scale of its human rights violations. How much longer will the EU accept this humiliation?' The Diaspora Affairs Ministry said that Hassan had publicly called for boycotts of companies operating in Israel, promoted sanctions and participated in boycott initiatives. In May, she urged a boycott of the French TV channel TF1 over an interview with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Two months later, she accused Israel of apartheid and called for a total boycott. In September, she backed a boycott of French retailer Carrefour over its Israeli operations, and supported a boycott of Starbucks last week, claiming it was 'complicit in genocide in Gaza.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjftv7jcjx	2025-02-25T05:25:16-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/24/rycabb9q1g/rycabb9q1g_210_141_469_264_0_small.jpg

Tehran-linked charity openly showcases humanitarian aid convoys delivering water and food to Gaza residents, displaying Iranian flags amid severe humanitarian crisis following Israel’s military withdrawal An Iranian charity linked to Tehran has begun openly distributing aid in Gaza, raising flags of the Islamic Republic on trucks delivering water and food amid a worsening humanitarian crisis, footage shared on social media showed Tuesday. The charity, known as Iran Hamdel, said online that it dispatched its fifth convoy of aid trucks into Gaza, where residents face severe daily water shortages following Israeli military withdrawal.

'The Iranian people will always stand by the heroic Palestinian people,' the charity wrote. Sources in Gaza said Tehran's representatives have long provided humanitarian relief, especially in refugee camps, though aid now includes cash and special care packages for mothers after childbirth. Aid distribution is carefully documented to ensure continued Iranian funding and to maintain Tehran’s influence in Gaza post-war. Residents line up daily for water deliveries due to the extensive destruction of wells and infrastructure during the conflict, and local sources said Iran’s involvement, previously low-profile, has become more visible, with Iranian flags now prominently displayed on aid trucks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1appxi5kx	2025-02-25T04:21:59-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/25/Bkg7NQzi9Je/Bkg7NQzi9Je_0_0_1280_645_0_small.jpg

Hundreds gather along route to Kibbutz Nir Oz for funeral procession of journalist and peace activist, killed while held hostage by Hamas; mourners sing Israel’s anthem Hatikvah as his coffin passes by Mourners gathered Tuesday to pay their final respects to Oded Lifshitz, one of three Israelis whose bodies were returned last week after being killed while held captive in Gaza by Palestinian terrorists. Lifshitz’s remains were brought back from Gaza last week as part of the hostage agreement, alongside those of brothers Kfir and Ariel Bibas. Israeli authorities later informed the family that Lifshitz had been killed while held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the early weeks of the war. The funeral procession began in Rishon Lezion, proceeded to the Sa’ad junction in southern Israel and continued toward Kibbutz Nir Oz, where Lifshitz will be laid to rest.

Several attendees sang Israel’s national anthem, Hatikvah.

Rishon Lezion Mayor Raz Kinstlich said, 'Today we part with heavy hearts and sadness. On behalf of our city’s residents, I extend condolences to his family.' Following identification at Israel’s forensic institute, Lifshitz’s family expressed deep sorrow but gratitude for closure. 'Now we can mourn the husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather we've missed since October 7,' the family said. 'Our healing begins today, but it won’t be complete until every hostage returns home.' Lifshitz, a journalist and peace activist, was one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz. He was kidnapped from his kibbutz home during the October 7 attack along with his wife Yocheved who was released a few weeks later. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjghkxjcje	2025-02-25T02:39:19-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/25/HygrLOfjq1g/HygrLOfjq1g_0_0_1280_853_0_small.jpg

The car was delivered by Haredi businessman and activist Shai Graucher, who decorated it with balloons in the colors of Damari's favorite soccer team, Maccabi Tel Aviv. The presentation took place at the hotel where Damari and other freed hostages are undergoing medical and emotional rehabilitation. 'There are no people like our people,' Damari said joyfully.

Trump administration quietly removes human rights condition from ...	Internal document reveals Trump quietly canceled Biden-era directive requiring US military aid recipients, including Israel amid Gaza war, to comply with international humanitarian law The Trump administration has quietly revoked a Biden-era requirement that countries receiving American weapons must pledge not to use them in ways violating international humanitarian law, according to a document cited by the Washington Post on Monday. The February 2024 directive, established during former President Joe Biden's tenure, mandated that countries receiving U.S. military aid—Israel among them—must commit in writing to uphold international humanitarian law and ensure the safe passage of American humanitarian aid deliveries. U.S. National Security Advisor Michael Waltz ordered the revocation in an internal document obtained by The Washington Post. Several administration officials anonymously confirmed the decision, though the White House has not issued a public announcement on the matter. The removal of the condition aligns with Trump's 'America First' policy and follows other recent steps to relax U.S. restrictions on arms exports. Last week, the administration also halted funding for Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces as part of a broader freeze on U.S. foreign aid. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Biden-era officials had viewed the memorandum as critical leverage, particularly during the Gaza war, to ensure Israel's cooperation with humanitarian relief efforts but critics argued that Biden had failed to enforce it effectively. During Trump’s first term, Washington cut direct aid to the PA but continued financing security training through the U.S. Security Coordinator (USSC), which acts as a liaison between Israel and the PA. PA security forces spokesperson Anwar Rajab told the Washington Post that the U.S. 'has been a major contributor to PA projects,' including force training. A former Israeli official said the USSC had 'not been significantly affected' by the funding freeze, as 'other donors stepped in to fill the gap.' However, a senior PA official said the freeze had already led to cuts in certain training programs. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyxftkiq1x	2025-02-24T23:22:13-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/ByrOteulYyx/ByrOteulYyx_0_119_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

As hostage talks stall, Hamas quietly prepares for renewed war in...	After Israeli withdrawal from Netzarim Corridor, Hamas tightens control over Gaza power centers, redeploying thousands of terrorists northward as Israel raises alert level along border and mobilizes reserve forces ahead of possible renewed ground offensive The crisis stemming from Israel’s delay in releasing Palestinian prisoners has intensified doubts over the continuation of the cease-fire and the second phase of hostage negotiations, prompting both Israel and Hamas to brace for renewed fighting. The 35-day cease-fire has allowed Hamas to reorganize its severely weakened forces, rebuild units damaged during 14 months of fighting and remain committed to attacking Israel, similar to its assault on October 7, 2023. During the cease-fire, thousands of Hamas operatives, mingled with returning civilians, moved northward in Gaza following Israel's withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor and the return of about half a million Palestinians to Gaza City. Tens of thousands found damaged or destroyed homes and returned to displacement centers near Khan Younis. Hamas terrorists regrouped into new combat units alongside thousands who had remained in northern Gaza throughout the fighting, though Israeli security officials assess these new formations remain weaker than Hamas' military capabilities prior to the war. Hamas’ reorganization likely includes appointing new commanders, utilizing undetected tunnels, constructing additional underground spaces, clearing explosives previously set to target Israeli troops and creating new explosive traps. Israeli surveillance identified rocket launchers and camera installations intended to monitor military activity. At least three rockets were fired from Gaza last week, likely accidentally, amid these preparations. Surveillance drones were also launched, and attempts by Israeli Arabs to smuggle equipment via drones were intercepted. Israeli military sources say Hamas learned key lessons from previous Israeli ground operations, noting that the group never deployed its entire 30,000-strong force during the previous fighting, recognizing it would not receive support from Hezbollah or other fronts. Additionally, Hamas has used civilian governance to rebuild its military and economic strength. During the cease-fire period, the terror group reclaimed control over municipalities and civilian infrastructure, including schools and social services. Hamas terrorists have set up checkpoints to seize hundreds of tons of food, fuel and water entering Gaza daily under agreements with Israel, re-establishing taxation systems to finance salaries for operatives. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Every day of the cease-fire helps Hamas relocate operatives, issue commands and rebuild,' IDF officials said. 'They face severe shortages in personnel, equipment and command infrastructure due to Israel’s offensive, but the last month proves significant work remains before Hamas is defeated.' Meanwhile, given the Israeli government's apparent reluctance to move toward the second phase of the hostage deal, the IDF is preparing for renewed ground combat, gathering new targets intended to weaken Hamas' civilian control in Gaza. Such operations would involve substantial troop deployments with close air support. However, military commanders remain aware of the strain on reserve forces, extensively mobilized over the past year-and-a-half. Regarding the Gaza emigration proposal championed by U.S. President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, security sources now indicate it is unlikely to move forward. The primary obstacle is the absence of a third country willing to accept Palestinians voluntarily leaving Gaza. 'There are far more problems than realistic chances of this initiative succeeding,' a senior security official said. 'If we manage a pilot program, perhaps with a few hundred Gazans voluntarily leaving despite Hamas checkpoints, others might follow—particularly if offered the option to return later. Jordan and Egypt, however, are unwilling to accept such migrants, highlighting a gap between public statements and practical realities.' IDF officials further question the initiative’s value in achieving Israel’s strategic goals. 'Even if we succeeded in relocating tens or even hundreds of thousands of Gazans without accusations of war crimes, how would this topple Hamas?' one official asked. 'While Hamas’ internal legitimacy might suffer, it would still retain control over more than a million Palestinians in Gaza.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj119nks51x	2025-02-24T22:56:27-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/22/BJFKWxPckx/BJFKWxPckx_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

U.S. military expert: Israel could deal ‘serious’ blow to Iran’s ...	Norman Roule, Senior Advisor to United Against Nuclear Iran: The Trump administration has maintained a consistent policy on Iran, balancing military preparedness with diplomatic efforts If Israel decided to attack Iran, it could do 'serious, profound, and consequential damage to Iran's nuclear program,' according to Norman Roule, Senior Advisor to United Against Nuclear Iran. 'That doesn't mean that the program would stop permanently or that the Iranians wouldn't be able to respond with significant air strikes against Israel on their own, with their surviving missile program,' Roule cautioned. 'In this case, you need American air defense assistance, American coordination with regional partners. And that's why that interaction between Washington and Jerusalem is so important. I believe it exists.' Roule noted that the Trump administration has maintained a consistent policy on Iran, balancing military preparedness with diplomatic efforts. First, he explained, the administration is committed to providing Israel with whatever it needs—not only for defense but also to empower it to act independently if necessary. At the same time, the administration seeks to avoid a broader Middle East conflict, ensuring Israel is prepared while working to prevent escalation. 'The goal is an agreement of some sort. In this regard, I think you're going to see the Trump administration work with regional partners,' Roule told ILTV. 'U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is in the region right now to seek a Gaza extension. I think you'll see more of that with Iran.' He added that he wouldn’t be surprised if the administration even attempted some form of direct engagement with Iran after coordinating with allies to assess its feasibility. 'But at the end of the day, this is an Iranian decision. If they increase their nuclear program, further attack us or partner interests, I think there will be a sharp military response from the United States,' Roule concluded.

I wanted to fight for the land'	An inside look at Am Yisrael Chai Foundation's work for the State of Israel The Dream Raffle, organized by the Am Yisrael Chai Foundation, has found a way for everyone to make an impact in Israel. By simply buying a raffle ticket, you can donate Torahs to IDF bases, plant fruit trees, and help families in need. Each ticket also gives you a chance to win a $1,000,000 apartment in the heart of Jerusalem. Shmuel Sackett, the founder of the Am Yisrael Chai Foundation, joined ILTV in the studio on Monday. ILTV: What motivated you to dedicate your life to helping others? Why did you start the Am Yisrael Chai Foundation? Sackett: So, I made Aliyah in 1990, and my whole ideology was not just to come here and live, but to get ‘MAD.’ MAD stands for ‘Make a Difference.’ I wanted to come here. I wanted to fight for the land. My son and son-in-law are fighting in Gaza as we speak. And I was looking to make a difference, to become an activist, and to help wherever I could. And that's exactly what Am Yisrael Chai Foundation does now with this Dream Raffle. ILTV: Every ticket purchased secures one verse in a Torah scroll that will be donated to an IDF army base. Why is this particular cause important to the Am Yisrael Chai Foundation? Sackett: I'm coming from the religious Zionist world, and this is something where we see both. We see the need to learn the Torah, and we see the need to fight for the land. And what symbolizes that better than a Torah scroll on an IDF base? So far, we've donated five of them, and we're donating a sixth this year on Pesach. In just a few months, we’re going to be donating a Torah scroll to a base on the Golan Heights. ILTV: Now, the Am Yisrael Chai Foundation has a lot of different community projects. You guys are supporting a lot of communities, from soldiers to families in need. How are all of these missions in the community funded? Sackett: It’s funded one way, and that's through the Dream Raffle. I don't fundraise all year long. We have one fundraiser only, and that is the Dream Raffle. ILTV: How did the idea for the Dream Raffle come about, and what do you hope to achieve with it? Sackett: I'm trying to bring all of Am Yisrael together. I've been fundraising for 30 years, and we usually use the traditional method of speaking to a specific individual—a philanthropist—and convincing him or her to give a generous donation. But I would rather have 1,000 people give $1 than one person give $1,000, and that's what we're doing with the raffle. We're reaching out to people. So far, we have sold close to 20,000 tickets, and we're trying to get everybody involved—not just in the dream of winning an apartment, but also in the mitzvah of helping across the land of Israel. ILTV: Now, I wanted to ask you—there are a lot of activities that the Am Yisrael Chai Foundation does. Are there any that are particularly close to your heart beyond, of course, the Dream Raffle? Sackett: Well, what Am Yisrael Chai Foundation does is build the land, defend the land, and educate the people. We have a fund for widows and orphans. Just today, I helped two different orphans who are getting married in the coming days, trying to ensure they have a proper wedding. One of them just lost a parent in the war. So what we do is help where others don't—or won't. Every project is close to our heart, and that’s why we reach out to people to get involved. Whether it’s searching for missing Israelis, planting 600,000 fruit trees across the country, or helping lone soldiers, we try to be part of all the important things that our nation needs.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s10o7aq9jg	2025-02-24T20:29:02-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/25/S1qWrA551g/S1qWrA551g_0_42_474_267_0_small.jpg

At the Hermon site, snow accumulated up to 20 centimeters, with temperatures dropping to -5°C. Strong, cold winds made it feel even colder, creating a true winter wonderland. Schools in Jerusalem, including special education centers and daycare facilities, opened at 9 a.m. due to concerns over icy roads. To assist parents, some institutions welcomed students as early as 8 a.m. The last significant snowfall in Jerusalem was in January 2022. Local councils and municipalities issued guidelines urging residents to stock up on essentials, including food, water, and medical supplies, in preparation for the storm. In the end, the situation proved relatively benign.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjwjttqcye	2025-02-24T20:00:53-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/24/SyDgpgc9Jg/SyDgpgc9Jg_0_154_2560_1442_0_small.jpg

Elon Musk defends Netanyahu under criminal indictment ;‘Deep Stat...	Billionaire serving in senior Trump administration role shares favorable film of the prime minister's trial, broadcast on Fox on his platform X Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, tasked by former President Donald Trump with leading massive cuts to the U.S. government, weighed in Monday on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s ongoing trial, claiming that the 'deep state is everywhere.' Musk, who has a friendly relationship with Netanyahu, shared a post on X from Fox News commentator Mark Levin. Levin had reposted an old documentary about Netanyahu’s legal battle, titled The Trial, describing it as part of the 'legal war against Netanyahu.' The documentary, directed by Gilad (Gili) Goldschmidt and Yoad Ben Yosef, focuses on the bribery charges in Case 4000, the most serious corruption case against Netanyahu. The filmmakers claim it explores unprecedented legal decisions, including the prosecution’s argument that Netanyahu allegedly received bribes in the form of favorable media coverage.

In a rare move, the judges heard classified arguments from Military Intelligence Directorate Chief Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva behind closed doors. As a result, they canceled Netanyahu’s scheduled testimony for Tuesday. The proceedings were recorded manually and placed in a secure vault. Before Netanyahu took the stand, the court had ruled that the prosecution’s direct examination would last 14 sessions, while the defense would submit a list of witnesses. The trial is scheduled to proceed three times a week unless the court decides otherwise. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkfl8p59je	2025-02-24T12:55:48-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/04/H1wV51lKkl/H1wV51lKkl_397_97_783_441_0_small.jpg
Israel votes with US against Ukraine resolution calling to preser...	Resolution calls for Ukrain's sovereignty and territorial integrity on the third anniversary of the Russian invasion; US vote followes a shift in US policy but resolution passes with majority support of 93 member states Israel joined the United States on Monday in voting against a United Nations General Assembly resolution marking the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The resolution, initiated by Ukraine and the European Union, called for upholding Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, an end to hostilities, and a peaceful resolution to the war. The measure passed with 93 countries voting in favor, while 65 abstained. Eighteen nations, including the U.S., Russia, Hungary, Nicaragua, Sudan, Mali, the Marshall Islands, Haiti, Eritrea, Niger, and Palau, voted against it. This marked the first time since the war began that both the U.S. and Israel voted against Ukraine at the U.N., reflecting a significant shift in American policy following former President Donald Trump’s recent harsh criticism of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his alignment with Russia’s stance. Until the last moment, it was unclear how the U.S. would vote, and Israel ultimately aligned itself with Washington. However, Israel was among the few countries to do so, along with its allies Hungary and several Pacific nations. Meanwhile, North Korea and Russia also opposed the resolution. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Since the war began, Israel has publicly supported Ukraine’s territorial integrity and even attempted to mediate between Kyiv and Moscow. Then-Prime Minister Naftali Bennett traveled to Moscow in an effort to broker peace. While Israel has backed Ukraine and provided assistance—mainly protective gear such as helmets, bulletproof vests, and gas masks—it has refrained from supplying offensive weapons, citing concerns over straining ties with Russia. Israel has also shared intelligence with Ukraine regarding Iran’s military support for Russia, particularly the supply of attack drones. However, Kyiv has repeatedly pushed Israel to increase its aid by providing offensive weapons—a request Israel has resisted. Recent reports suggested that Israel transferred Patriot missile defense systems to Ukraine, but it was later clarified that the systems were first sent to the U.S., which then delivered them to Ukraine. Despite occasional tensions over military aid, Ukrainian public opinion has largely sympathized with Israel, particularly after the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks. Many Ukrainians have expressed a sense of shared fate with Israel in their struggles against external threats. Israeli lawmaker Gilad Kariv, chairman of the Knesset’s Immigration, Absorption, and Diaspora Affairs Committee, strongly criticized Israel’s decision to vote against Ukraine, calling it a 'moral and ethical disgrace.' 'On the day the world marks three years since Russia’s assault on Ukraine, Israel has chosen to vote against the attacked party,' Kariv said. 'This is a moral and ethical failure that could ultimately harm Israel. The free world must stand with Ukraine, not reward an aggressor that undermines fundamental values of sovereignty and democracy.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1kueu9qke	2025-02-24T12:37:34-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/09/20/r1lcK2ROk6/r1lcK2ROk6_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Israel optimistic bodies of hostages could be returned	Sources tell Saudi owned outlet the remains of two Israeli hostages could be released within hours although Hamas demands more prisoners be freed along with 620 whose release was delayed since Saturday Israeli officials said on Monday that they were optimistic that the negotiations to return the bodies of four hostages would soon be successful although Hamas has publicly said it would not release them while Israel refuses to free Palestinian prisoners under the terms of the cease-fire agreement. Israel halted the release of 620 Palestinians from jail on Saturday after Hamas showed a clip of two Israeli captives brought to view the release of Omer Shem Tov, Omer Wenkert, and Avera Mengistu. Sources involved in the talks told the Saudi owned UK-based Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper that if all goes well, Hamas may release the bodies of two dead hostages within hours. The sources said the terror group was prepared to avoid a ceremony but would demand the release of the prisoners as well as additional terrorists from jail. Israel demands that the four bodies that Hamas was to release on Thursday would be handed over without the shameful ceremony the terror group staged when they released the bodies of the Bibas family and Oded Lifshitz last week. Jerusalem also demands that no Palestinian prisoners be freed before a positive identification can be made after Hamas delivered the body of an unknown Palestinian female instead of Shiri Bibas who was murdered in captivity.

Released hostage held for nearly 500 days by Hamas terrorists since his abduction in the Oct. 7 massacre says that day has never ended for him and could not until all of the hostages are free and return home Keith Siegel (65), a survivor of Hamas captivity who was released earlier this month as part of the second hostage deal, returned to Kfar Aza on Monday to see the devastation caused in the Hamas massacre on October 7, when he was abducted by the terrorists to Gaza. He filmed a video thanking President Trump. 'Two weeks after I was returned from the Gaza Strip, I asked to visit Kfar Aza, my home, the place from which I was abducted to hell,' he said. 'While I was in captivity, I imagined thousands of times the moment I’d be able to return home. I hoped it would happen sooner, and that I wouldn’t have to endure the journey of torture that I went through.' In the video, which President Trump shared on his social media platform 'TruthSocial,' Keith addressed him in English against the backdrop of the ruins of Kfar Aza: 'Thank you for everything you’ve done to get the hostages out of Gaza. You can see the enormous destruction that Hamas did on the October 7 massacre. It's hard to believe and comprehend what I'm seeing today. Homes that were destroyed by Hamas, that were burned. People of the Kibbutz were murdered, burned alive. I wanted to say to you once again how urgent it is to get all of the hostages out of Gaza... we all urge you to continue your efforts.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: After filming his post Siegal said returning to Kfar Aza evoked difficult feelings. 'I didn’t realize how hard coming home would be,' he said. 'My house is broken and shattered, just like my heart. The harsh sights triggered traumatic and painful memories that will forever remain etched in my body and soul. For me, October 7 hasn’t ended, and it won’t end until everyone comes home.' He added, 'Our community has gone through the worst imaginable, and we won’t be able to recover until Gali, Ziv, and all the hostages come home. Everything must be done urgently to bring our brothers and sisters back. After that, we’ll do whatever it takes to rebuild and truly feel safe again.' Arbel Yehoud, who was released from Hamas captivity at the end of January, wrote a letter to her partner, Ariel Konyo, who remains held by the terror organization in Gaza. 'Pap, my love, do you remember when we arrived in Panama? One of our first days there, we went on a bike ride around Bocas del Toro. Halfway through, I told you, 'That’s enough, let’s go back,' but every few minutes, you kept saying, 'Just a little further, beautiful, just a little further,' and we kept going. Eventually, we found a secluded spot on the beach, as if someone had painted it with a brush—there was no one else around. 'I remember looking at you before we sat down. My eyes said: 'Thank you for insisting we keep going—you brought me to a view that filled my heart with butterflies.' My love, we’ve been thrown into a journey we never chose, one that is destroying our lives. But now, I’m the one who’s insisting. Be strong. Hold on to that incredible calm of yours. Believe in the good, even when it feels impossible. There’s no other option, no other ending—only the moment you come back, and we find a new breathtaking view that fills our hearts with butterflies again. I love you.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkcek4q91l	2025-02-24T10:41:59-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/24/rJLxAoz99yg/rJLxAoz99yg_24_562_557_314_0_small.jpg
Trump wants Ukraine's minirals in exchange for US aid	American president offers continued US security and economic assistance to Ukraine in exchange for exclusive access to its vast untapped rare mineral resources; Zelensky calls terms impossible amid limited options against Russian aggression President Donald Trump conditioned continued U.S. security and economic aid to Ukraine on gaining access to Ukraine’s vast, rare, and largely untapped mineral resources. U.S. extortion? According to reports on Sunday, the U.S. administration and Ukraine were close to signing an agreement that would grant the U.S. exclusive access to profits from the extraction of rare minerals in Ukraine, a condition Trump demanded as a prerequisite for continued support for Ukraine. The Trump administration also demanding that future earnings Ukraine generates from these resources, as well as from ports and other infrastructure, be transferred to a special fund controlled by the U.S. until the fund accumulates $500 billion. 'At our current profitability from these minerals, it would take us 250 years to pay back $500 billion,' Ukrainian President VolodymyrZelensky said. 'This means that ten generations of Ukrainians would have to repay this debt. It’s an impossible amount, and I cannot sign such an agreement.' Indeed, this is a staggering sum: Ukraine’s annual revenues from its resources amount to $1.1 billion per year, which is four times less than the total U.S. investment in Ukraine to date. However, it seems Zelensky and his European Union counterparts have little choice, as they lack assets they can leverage to sweeten the American offer. U.S. assistance and military presence are the only deterrents keeping Russia from invading the continent. Despite Ukraine’s explicit requests, the U.S. administration refuses to provide any guarantees beyond future funding for rebuilding the country and its economy. A significant portion of these funds was expected to come from territories currently occupied by Russia, including the resource-rich Donbas region. Tensions between Trump and Zelensky The conflict comes at the end of a week filled with mutual blows between Trump and Zelensky. 'He’s an unelected dictator,' Trump said of Zelensky, while Zelensky responded, 'He’s trapped in a web of disinformation,' after Trump claimed that Zelensky was the one who started the war. And on Monday, the U.S. voted for the first time against a Ukrainian resolution at the United Nations, calling for its soverignty to be respected on the third anniversary of the Russian invation of Ukriane. According to sources close to Trump in the White House, this deal is a dream come true for Ukraine. 'There are no greater guarantees than the Trump administration's promise of future economic cooperation,' a senior Trump administration official told CBS. 'Ukraine has vast, untapped mineral deposits that international investors have avoided due to bureaucratic and legal hurdles. These resources account for only 2.5% of Ukraine’s budget revenues—a number that should be much higher and could secure long-term economic independence. The establishment of an American economic interest in Ukraine is a far greater deterrent to Russia than any amount of weapons we could provide.' Ukraine has immense deposits, including titanium and lithium, of rare resources used globally for batteries, TVs, lasers, electric cars, and clean energy. For example, Ukraine is estimated to have 500,000 tons of lithium, making it the European country with the largest lithium resources. However, not a single gram has been utilized. Reuters reported that Ukraine has reserves of 22 out of 34 minerals classified by the European Union as rare, including rare earth metals like lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, erbium, and yttrium. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: These resources are valued by experts at $12 trillion, with more than 50% of them annexed by Russia and under its occupation. However, many remain untapped. In 2021, President Zelensky initiated a plan offering significant government subsidies and tax breaks to encourage international companies to mine in Ukraine. However, before the plan could take shape, Russia invaded Ukraine. Trump’s current plan aims to seize these resources, primarily as part of his trade war strategy against resource-rich China. Shifting negotiations Following tensions between the two leaders, Trump decided to initiate peace talks with Putin without the participation of Ukraine or its EU allies. After Ukraine rejected an initial American proposal for U.S. control over 50% of resource revenues—and as Zelensky embarked on a negotiation tour in Arab states to seek future investments—Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, visited Kyiv for a three-day trip. Afterward, Zelensky issued much softer statements to the media about progress in talks and the possibility of reaching an agreement. It is estimated Ukraine has agreed to the U.S. demand in exchange for American guarantees to Kyiv. 'The reparations demanded are higher than those imposed on Germany under the Versailles Treaty after World War I,' wrote the Daily Telegraph. 'The initial U.S. proposal was entirely one-sided in favor of the Americans. It essentially outlined that Ukrainians would have to pay the Americans their share first, and only afterward could they feed themselves.' However, it seems the initial proposal was merely Trump’s opening bid in negotiations—a proposal made to ultimately compromise on the next offer. Trump knows that EU nations will not dare send troops to Ukraine. He knows that if he withdraws from the game, Ukraine will be handed to Russia on a silver platter. Above all, he wants a return on America’s investment in Ukraine so far. Zelensky has few options. 'He’s entering negotiations with no cards to play,' Trump said of Zelensky last week. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1gfjqq9ye	2025-02-24T10:30:47-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/B111fkTmqkl/B111fkTmqkl_231_12_1495_842_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah orders operatives to withdraw from Southern Lebanon, al...	Hezbollah-affiliated source say group has been weakened, but it has not been defeated and had partially replenished its ranks with operatives from Syria even before the fall of the Assad regime A week after Israel completed its withdrawal from most of southern Lebanon, a Hezbollah-affiliated source told The Wall Street Journal on Monday that the terror group has issued an internal memo instructing its combat units to vacate positions in the region. The directive applies to operatives not originally from southern Lebanon and is intended to allow the Lebanese army to take control of the area under the terms of the cease-fire agreement. 'Hezbollah has suffered heavy losses,' the source said, noting that the group had partially replenished its ranks with operatives from Syria even before the fall of the Assad regime. Despite this, some units remain prepared for renewed fighting. 'The group has been weakened, but it has not been defeated,' the source added. Following two and a half months of cease-fire and its subsequent extensions, during which the IDF continued maneuvering in southern Lebanon to destroy Hezbollah’s military infrastructure, Israeli forces completed their withdrawal last Tuesday. However, the IDF has maintained a limited troop presence at five strategic outposts just a few hundred meters from the border fence. These positions, staffed by hundreds of soldiers, will remain occupied until further notice from Israel’s political leadership. 'Who will compensate us for our losses?' Three months after Hezbollah agreed to the cease-fire, the extent of the group's financial and operational damage is becoming clear. According to The Wall Street Journal, Hezbollah has been significantly weakened, and its economic capabilities have been severely impacted, to the point where it is struggling to meet its financial commitments to its fighters and supporters. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Before the war, Hezbollah operated as a 'state within a state,' providing jobs and social services to its backers. The organization had also pledged financial support to the families of its fallen fighters and to civilians who lost homes or businesses. However, the mounting costs of these promises have made many of the payments impossible. Some residents say Al-Qard Al-Hassan, Hezbollah’s financial arm, which was targeted by Israeli airstrikes during the conflict, has recently frozen compensation payments. Others say they have received no assistance at all. 'I have so many questions about why we were dragged into this conflict, the suffering we endured, and who will compensate us for our losses,' Jalal Nassar, a restaurant owner in the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, told The Wall Street Journal. He said he had to pay $100,000 to rebuild his restaurant after it was completely destroyed in airstrikes. Nassar added that an engineering team affiliated with Hezbollah visited his business to assess the damage but provided no financial support. 'The war was a mistake,' he said. Hezbollah's financial struggles Hezbollah’s financial difficulties stem in part from efforts by Lebanon’s new U.S.-backed government to curb the flow of Iranian cash to the terror group. The fall of the Assad regime in Syria has also dealt a blow to Hezbollah, cutting off critical smuggling routes for weapons and money. Since the cease-fire took effect in late November, Hezbollah has been trying to regroup. According to a source at Al-Qard Al-Hassan, the group has allocated $630 million in payments to families who lost homes or whose residences were damaged in the war. Committees managed by Hezbollah have reportedly assessed damage to hundreds of thousands of homes. A researcher at a Beirut-based think tank told The Wall Street Journal that Hezbollah’s recent calls for the Lebanese government to absorb much of the reconstruction costs suggest the group will likely rely on the administration of President Michel Aoun to cover its financial shortfalls. This, the researcher added, could help Hezbollah ease growing frustration among its supporters. 'Lebanon’s government wants to weaken Hezbollah’s role in society,' the source said. 'But to do that, it must deliver results.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryka67951l	2025-02-24T09:51:43-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/H1xE6Z7B00ke/H1xE6Z7B00ke_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Hamas official calls Oct. 7 massacre a mistake, after realizing c...	Moussah Abu Marzouk says he would not have supported the attack if he had known the devastation it would bring to Gaza; hints at internal divisions within Hamas over military strategy and cease-fire negotiations A senior Hamas official has expressed regret over the group’s Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel, acknowledging that he would not have supported the assault had he known the scale of destruction it would bring to Gaza. Mousa Abu Marzouk, head of Hamas’s foreign relations office, said in an interview with The New York Times that the consequences of the attack—an Israeli military campaign that has devastated the enclave and killed tens of thousands of Palestinians—would have made it 'impossible' for him to back the operation. 'If it was expected that what happened would happen, there wouldn’t have been Oct. 7,' Abu Marzouk said. He noted that he was not informed about the specific plans for the attack but had endorsed Hamas’s broader military strategy. His remarks stand in contrast to statements from other Hamas officials who have continued to justify the assault. While Hamas has declared 'victory' over Israel and vowed future attacks, Abu Marzouk’s comments suggest internal divisions over the decision and its aftermath. Abu Marzouk, 74, also indicated that Hamas may be open to discussing the future of its weapons in Gaza—an issue that has stalled negotiations with Israel. 'We are ready to speak about every issue,' he said when asked about the group’s military arsenal. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: This stance appears to contradict statements from other Hamas leaders, including Osama Hamdan, who recently ruled out any discussion on disarmament. Abu Marzouk dismissed Hamdan’s remarks, saying no single leader could set the group’s agenda alone. His comments hint at growing pressure on Hamas leadership, as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens and frustration among Palestinians rises. Analysts suggest that acknowledging strategic miscalculations could be an attempt to influence ongoing cease-fire negotiations. Israel and Hamas were expected to resume discussions on the next phase of a cease-fire, which would involve a permanent end to hostilities, an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and the release of more hostages and Palestinian prisoners. However, delays in talks and disputes over implementing the first phase have raised concerns that fighting could resume. Abu Marzouk suggested Hamas was open to negotiating a large-scale hostage-prisoner exchange. While Israel has resisted previous proposals, he indicated the group might agree to a 'comprehensive deal' if Israel freed thousands of Palestinian prisoners, ended the war, and withdrew from Gaza. Despite his remarks, Hamas terrorists have continued to parade with weapons in Gaza, signaling defiance. Abu Marzouk’s comments underscore the fractures within Hamas leadership, but it remains unclear whether his position reflects a broader shift in the group’s stance—or an attempt to pressure Israel into further negotiations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ddde5qjx	2025-02-24T09:47:58-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2014/08/24/5541654/5541654_0_0_3300_1857_0_small.jpg

Ilan Mengistu, the brother of Avera Mengistu, describes emotional closure; 'We're still trying to process the miracle that happened to us,' Ilan says, 'He recognizes us and responds. He has incredible inner strength' The Mengistu family is still processing what they call a miracle—the return of Avera Mengistu after more than a decade in Hamas captivity. His brother, Ilan Mengistu, was the first to greet him upon his arrival in Israel on Saturday. 'He responds to questions when asked, makes eye contact, and we're trying not to overwhelm him,' Ilan shared Monday. 'There's a generally good feeling, but he has a long rehabilitation ahead.' In an interview with Ynet, Ilan described their emotional reunion, and said Avera immediately seemed to recognize that something positive was happening. 'I believe he will improve over time. Our mother is a lioness—she never stopped believing he was alive, and she welcomed him back with tears in her eyes.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Avera on Saturday, thanking his family for their unwavering faith and efforts to secure his return. 'All of Israel is moved and embraces you today,' Netanyahu told him, according to the Prime Minister's Office. Ilan recalled the brief exchange: 'Avera simply said he was 'okay'—nothing more. It was a very short call, and we thanked him.' Avera, who struggles with mental illness, crossed into Gaza on his own on Oct. 7, 2014. 'I don't know how much he fully understands,' Ilan admitted. 'I was the first to hear the devastating news when he crossed the border, and now I was the first to see him in Re’im. It was an incredible sense of closure.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He described how Avera’s natural gesture of reaching for his hand and showing him respect signaled recognition. 'He even remembered something from our childhood—when I injured my finger with a bullet. He asked how my hand was doing. We need to keep supporting him and praying for him.' On his brother’s fragile mental state, Ilan said: 'Avera came back alive and physically well. Despite the hell he endured, his condition is stable. We believe he will only improve. Right now, he's not sharing much, and we’re giving him space to recover in the most natural way possible. But in Re’im, I saw it—the humanity, the face of Avera, had returned to him.' In January 2023, Hamas released the first proof of life—a short video of Avera in captivity. 'Even our mother had trouble recognizing him in that footage,' Ilan said. 'But when he arrived in Re’im, when he was in the hands of Israeli soldiers, his soul came back to him. We could feel it—his recognition, his connection to us. After a decade in captivity, in inhumane conditions and complete isolation, his spirit remains incredibly strong. We believe he will overcome this.' Sourasky Medical Center in Israel, where both Avera and Hisham Al Sayed were taken for medical evaluation, acknowledged the complexity of their recovery. 'The circumstances of their prolonged captivity and their return after so many years present significant challenges,' hospital officials said. 'We feel both honored and deeply responsible to lead their care, navigating complexities we have never encountered before.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skix7fc5jg	2025-02-24T08:42:28-08:00	https://images1.ynet.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/22/H1VETVSv5kx/H1VETVSv5kx_6_74_1025_577_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu’s sparks outrage, protests across border after remarks ...	Syrians stage widespread protests , denouncing prime minister's demand for a demilitarized southern Syria and the need to protect the local Druze community; Syrian anger focuses on IDF troop presence undermining Syrian sovereignty Protests broke out in Syria early on Monday. after comments made by Prime Minister Benjamin Netnayahu on Sunday, warning Israel would not allow the new Syrian regime to send trooops south of Damascus. 'We demand the complete demilitarization of southern Syria in the provinces of Quneitra, Daraa and Suwayda from the forces of the new regime. Likewise, we will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria.' In a speach to a ceremony for graduates of the IDF’s combat officer course, Netanyahu said that IDF troops would remain 'on Mount Hermon and in the buffer zone indefinitely.' Protests across Syria The demonstrations erupted in multiple locations, including the city of Bosra al-Sham, east of Daraa, as well as As-Suwayda and Quneitra. Video clips from the protests showed demonstrators waving the new Syrian flag and chanting slogans inciting against Israel, Jews, and Netanyahu himself. A journalist from Quneitra told Ynet that there was widespread anger following Netanyahu's remarks and tension along the border. 'There are nine Israeli military bases or positions inside Syrian territory,' he said. 'This violates the Disengagement Agreement between Israel and Syria from 1974. There is no justification for these troops to enter Syrian territory. They damage agricultural lands, block civilians from accessing their towns, and harm their lands and properties.' Since the fall of Assad's regime, IDF troops have been stationed in the demilitarized zone. 'There is immense anger among people in Quneitra, Daraa, and As-Suwayda following Netanyahu’s statements,' the journalist said. 'There is no justification for these remarks, and no justification for him to interfere in Syria again. Netanyahu is trying to incite conflict between Sunnis and Druze, but this has no place among the Syrian people. He is attempting to prolong the war in the Middle East. The war will end in Gaza and Lebanon, but he is doing everything he can to extend his rule in Israel by provoking Syria. A new war cannot be ignited after 14 years of fighting against Iran, Hezbollah, and Assad's regime.' Reactions to Netanyahu's statements He also claimed that Netanyahu's remarks were a direct challenge to Syrian sovereignty. 'This is a direct threat to the government. The Syrian people have just emerged from war; they want nothing but stability and security—so why is Netanyahu threatening Syrian territory?' Syria had paid a heavy price for its 14-year war—in lives, property, and widespread destruction, he said. 'The whole world thought there would be a civil war in the country after Bashar Assad fell, but that didn’t happen. There was a breakthrough, and coexistence was achieved. In Quneitra, we were surprised by the entry of Israeli troops. They took away our joy over the regime’s fall and the departure of Iran from Syria.' The journalist said there was no justification for Israel's incursion into Syrian territory. 'The Syrian people are highly aware, educated, and know right from wrong. There is absolutely no justification for the entry of foreign troops into Syrian territory.' He claimed it was Syria that fought to expel Iran, and now Israel is labeling Syrians as terrorists, despite it being the Syrians who removed the Iranians. 'I am on Syrian soil, in southern Syria, and I do not see what Netanyahu is talking about,' he added. Regarding the protests throughout the day, the journalist noted: 'Large demonstrations will be held today and tomorrow, especially in southern Syria.' He explained that Syrians in the As-Suwayda, Daraa, and Quneitra regions are asking the Syrian government to allow their new military forces to enter their areas to protect them. He said the Syrian government is working hard to control the borders, collecting scattered weapons across the country, and that the new leadership seeks to represent the entire spectrum of the Syrian people.

According to Al-Arabiya, IDF has made financial offers to residents of southern Syria. Sources from Quneitra told the Saudi outlet that IDF recently surveyed the population in various areas, examining the number of residents and their occupations, and offered some of them the opportunity to work in Israel. 'The Israeli army informed those who were offered work that they would be issued entry permits to Israel to work there, similar to what is done with Palestinians, in exchange for a sum of money for each worker—a sum considered significant compared to wages in Syria.' According to the report, daily wages range from $75 to $100, which could attract many Syrians, though others rejected the offer, claiming Israel is occupying their land. Last week, Al-Mayadeen citined a local Syrian source, who said that IDF troops had entered villages in the Quneitra area of southern Syria, conducted a census, which they claimed was intended to provide aid to the population.

Captives who were freed recently tell Ohel's family about the dire conditions their son is enduring, his eye is hurt and untreated, he sees only shadows is in pain with shrapnel lodged in his body, arms and neck; 'He must be released, it is critical,' father says Alon Ohel, held hostage by Hamas since his abduction during the Hamas massacre, has been in a dark tunnel for the entire time in captivity, chained and starved, Kobi, his father said on Monday after hearing from Eliya Cohen, who was with his son until his release last Saturday. Alon who was injured in his eye at the Nova music festival has not received treatment. He is in pain and sees only shadows. 'It is critical that he receive care,' his father said. The first sign of life came after the release of Eli Sharabi and Or Levy who were also with Alon. The hostages slept on the floor in difficult conditions, the distraught father said after he received the call. 'It confirmed the urgency of returning Alon home,' he said. 'From what we understand these have been the conditions of their captivity since they were taken during the massacre. Alon has shrapnel lodged in his body, arms and neck. That can be felt by touch.' Eliya who was released along with Omer Shem Tov, Omer Wenkert, Avera Mengistu and Hisham Al-Sayed on Saturday described how difficult it was for him to leave Alon behind. 'Despite it all, Alon has survived although he does not know what the future holds or what Hamas has planned for him,' Kobi said. 'I don't know either. All they had to eat was one pita bread a day.

Israel bans entry for EU parliamentarian over calls for boycott	French Rima Hassan, who identifies as Palestinian a fierce Israel critics, refused entry at Ben Gurion Airport by orders of Interior Minister Moshe Arbel; Interior Minister Moshe Arbel ordered Monday to deny entry to European Parliament member Rima Hassan while she was already en route to Israel from Brussels. Hassan, who was scheduled to arrive as part of a European Union delegation, was barred on the recommendation of the Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism due to her anti-Israel activism, including support for boycots Hassan claimed her visit was for a project in East Jerusalem. However, upon landing, she and three who were accompanying her were denied entry and will be deported. Hassan, a French citizen born in the Palestinian refugee camp of Neirab in Syria, identifies as Palestinian and is widely regarded as one of Israel’s harshest critics in the European Parliament. Israeli officials have linked her to pro-Hamas campaigns. She has denied supporting the militant group, saying that while she condemns Hamas' 'war crimes,' she refuses to 'bow to the political-media order that demands turning this natural empathy into support for the State of Israel.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to the Ministry for Diaspora Affairs, Hassan has publicly called for boycotting Israeli-linked businesses, participated in initiatives aimed at isolating the country, and promoted sanctions against it. On May 31, 2024, she called for a boycott of French TV channel TF1 after it broadcast an interview with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Two months later, she accused Israel of apartheid, comparing it to South Africa’s former regime and called for a complete boycott. In September, she urged a boycott of French supermarket chain Carrefour after it began operations in Israel. Just last week, she voiced support for a boycott of Starbucks, alleging the company was 'complicit in genocide in Gaza.' On Sunday, Hassan posted images of Palestinian youths throwing stones at Israeli tanks, with the caption: '1986 in Palestine, 2025 in Palestine.' Throughout the war, she has shared hundreds of posts about Palestinian casualties in Gaza and the West Bank, repeatedly accusing Israel of 'genocide.' Arbel’s office said in a statement: 'Hassan, who is expected to land in Israel, consistently promotes boycotts against the country and frequently makes anti-Israel statements in both social media and media interviews. Following the recommendation of the Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, Interior Minister Moshe Arbel has decided to deny her entry to Israel. Upon arrival, she will be sent back to Brussels.' Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli, who recommended barring her, added: 'The State of Israel is not obligated to grant entry to any foreign official, including members of parliament if they work to delegitimize or boycott the country. Rima Hassan, a European Parliament member, actively leads anti-Israel campaigns, calls for boycotts, and encourages economic sanctions. Israel will not provide a platform or legitimacy to those acting against it. We will use all available means to prevent the exploitation of our democracy for anti-Israel agendas. Israel’s sovereignty is not up for grabs, and we will defend it with determination.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjtog119q1e	2025-02-24T06:04:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/24/rJqoe11551x/rJqoe11551x_0_166_878_494_0_small.jpg

With hostage's return, Ori Danino’s final act of heroism is compl...	On October 7, Danino was close to escaping the Nova music festival when he made a fateful decision - to turn back and try to rescue Omer Shem Tov and Maya and Itay Regev; the three were released, but Danino was killed in captivity On October 7, as Hamas launched its deadly attack on Israel, Ori Danino was close to escaping the Nova music festival when he made a fateful decision. He and a friend had fled toward their respective cars, but before leaving, Danino turned back. He sent a message to his friend, asking for the phone numbers of siblings Maya and Itay Regev and of Omer Shem Tov — people he had met just hours earlier. 'This is not the time to be a hero,' his friend told him. But Danino insisted: 'I’ll be fine. I need to bring them home.' Danino managed to find the Regev siblings and Shem Tov, but their vehicle was intercepted by Hamas gunmen, and all four were taken hostage in Gaza. Maya and Itay Regev were freed in a hostage deal in November 2023. Danino was among six hostages who were killed in a Hamas tunnel in September. On Saturday, with the release of Shem Tov, Danino’s mission was considered complete — he had saved all three. A post on an Instagram page dedicated to Danino’s memory simply read: 'Ori, you did it.' 'We feel a sense of closure and are happy for Omer,' Ori’s father, Rabbi Elhanan Danino, told Ynet. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We know Ori wouldn’t have acted any differently — that’s just who he was. When we first heard what he had done, we weren’t surprised. That was Ori. He once told me that giving his life for the country would be his greatest honor. We know he went back knowingly. We live with immense pain, but when we think about what he wanted in life, we understand that he always put others before himself. My comfort, at least as a man of faith, is that this was his choice.' The Danino family has not yet spoken to Shem Tov. 'I believe that when things settle, we’ll have a very emotional meeting,' Elhanan said. 'We are in close and good contact with his parents. We’ll let time take its course. We want him to return to a normal life, at least for his family. We won’t pressure him, we won’t demand answers. Of course, we care deeply, but his life and his family come first.' Speaking at a hospital on Sunday night, Omer’s mother, Sheli Shem Tov, paid tribute to Danino. 'I want to acknowledge and honor Ori Danino, who, on October 7, went back into the inferno to save Maya and Itay Regev and my son, Omer,' she said. 'Ori had only met them a few hours earlier, yet he didn’t think of himself or his own family, who raised him with the values of mutual responsibility and never leaving anyone behind. Ori survived 11 months in captivity under inhumane conditions and was murdered by Hamas monsters. He is the hero and guardian angel of Maya, Itay, and Omer.' As the first phase of the latest hostage deal nears its scheduled conclusion on Thursday, many hostages remain in captivity, still waiting to come home. 'Every day there is another day when murder could take place,' Elhanan Danino said. 'No one has the right to force more families in Israel into mourning. Stop calling this ‘Phase I’ or ‘Phase II’—just continue Phase I until it’s finished! There are no phases when it comes to saving lives. It must happen immediately. You can’t tell the hostages to wait for one phase or another. Every day is an eternity. Every minute is an eternity. That’s why they must be brought home now. Families are breaking apart, and the children — what they’ve endured is horrific. The government hasn’t done enough, that’s clear. The only ones making this happen are the Americans. Without Trump — before he even took office — Israel’s government wouldn’t have understood how precious human life is.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/r1ww5ay9ye	2025-02-24T04:41:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/23/SkZudbF51e/SkZudbF51e_1_144_2000_1126_0_small.jpg

Eulogies to be broadcast and Israeli flags in procession's path: ...	Shiri Bibas and her children Ariel and Kfir set to be buried in private ceremony on Wednesday with family asking public to wave Israeli flags on procession's path; Oded Lifshitz to be buried at Nir Oz on Tuesday The funerals of Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas, murdered in Hamas captivity, will be held on Wednesday. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum invited the Israeli public to stand along the funeral procession's route waving Israeli flags. At the family's request, the ceremony will be private, but eulogies will be broadcast at 11:30 a.m. local time. No government officials were invited. Shiri Bibas' body was identified at the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute Friday overnight after Hamas delayed transferring it to the Red Cross by a day. Initially, Hamas sent a coffin containing a Palestinian woman's body and claimed Bibas' remains 'may have mixed with others.' A day earlier, the bodies of her young sons, Kfir and Ariel, were identified. According to IDF intelligence and forensic evidence, the three were murdered by their captors in the early weeks of the war. IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said they were 'murdered by terrorists in cold blood,' refuting Hamas' claims that they died in an airstrike. 'The terrorists did not shoot the two young boys, they killed them with their bare hands,' he said, adding that efforts were made to conceal the crime. Kibbutz Nir Oz, the family's home town, said in a statement that Shiri, 32 at the time of her abduction, was born and raised there. She worked in the kibbutz's accounting department and previously in local education. 'Shiri, Yarden, Ariel and Kfir loved their home in Nir Oz — the porch, the grass — where they shared countless happy moments as a family before being kidnapped on October 7,' the statement read. Her family added, 'For 16 months, we were looking for certainty. Now there’s no comfort, but we hope this brings some closure.' Yarden's sister, Ofri Bibas, spoke about his grief after his family's bodies were identified. 'In just two weeks, we went from immense joy over Yarden's return to deep sorrow and shock over Shiri and the children's murder in captivity,' she said. She noted that Yarden is struggling with the media attention and the weight of the tragedy. 'He swings between relief at surviving hell and unbearable loss. He often wonders how Shiri would react to all this — but Shiri isn’t here to go through it with him.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The family reiterated their request for a private funeral, attended only by relatives and invited guests. The government informed ministers that the family asked politicians not to attend the funeral or the mourning period. The Eshkol Regional Council urged the public to respect the family's wishes. 'To allow the family to say goodbye in the most personal and intimate way and due to space limitations, we ask everyone to honor their choice,' the council said. Large police and security forces will be stationed around the procession and the public is advised to follow instructions. The Bibas family thanked everyone 'for the love support and shared grief.' The funeral of Oded Lifshitz will take place on Tuesday, February 25, at 2:00 p.m. local time at Kibbutz Nir Oz’s cemetery. Lifshitz, 83, was identified at Israel’s forensic institute after 503 days in Gaza. He was kidnapped from his Nir Oz home and murdered in captivity. He was injured while trying to close his shelter door on October 7 and abducted along with his wife, Yocheved, who was released in a November 2023 hostage deal. According to her testimony, terrorists dressed him in Muslim garments. Lifshitz, one of Nir Oz's founders, arrived in the kibbutz in 1956. A peace activist, he transported Palestinian cancer patients from Gaza for treatment in Israel. 'My father's life ended in a tragic and humiliating way,' said his son, Yizhar. 'His home was burned, his wife was beaten and kidnapped before his eyes. Terrible. Alone, without family, without his children, without closure.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h19rnat5ke	2025-02-24T04:33:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/06/Hkf6tPJPw0/Hkf6tPJPw0_0_48_768_432_0_small.jpg

Bloc started asset freezes, travel bans on Syrian officials, banks, agencies and other organizations in 2011, in response to then-President Assad’s crackdown on protesters, which festered into civil war The European Union on Monday began easing energy and transport sanctions and banking restrictions against Syria, aiming to help breathe life into the conflict-torn country’s economy if its new leaders work toward a peaceful future. The EU started to impose asset freezes and travel bans on Syrian officials, banks, agencies and other organizations in 2011, in response to then-President Bashar Assad’s crackdown on protesters, which festered into a civil war. But after Assad was toppled in a lightning rebel offensive in December, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the main former rebel group now in control of Syria, set up an interim administration, saying that a new government would be formed through an inclusive process by March. Eager to encourage the new leadership, the EU said it was suspending measures targeting oil, gas and electricity as well as transport, and notably the aviation sector. The possibility to fund and provide certain economic resources to five banks will be reinstated. Restrictions on the export of luxury goods to Syria for personal use will also be eased. The decision to lift the sanctions was taken by EU foreign ministers and was made as part of efforts 'to support an inclusive political transition in Syria, and its swift economic recovery, reconstruction, and stabilization,' a statement said. The EU said that it would monitor developments in Syria to see whether other economic sanctions could be lifted, but it has also kept open the possibility of slapping the sanctions back on should the new leaders take the country in the wrong direction.

Israel demands: Release of terrorists for immediate return of 4 s...	Jerusalem also demands assurances no public ceremonies will take place, similar to those that occurred during release of Bibas children and Oded Lifshitz Israel has conveyed a proposal to mediators offering to release 620 Palestinian prisoners whose release has been delayed since Saturday in exchange for the immediate return of four slain hostages, an Israeli official told Ynet on Monday. As part of the proposal, Israel is demanding assurances that no public ceremonies will take place, similar to those that occurred during the release of the Bibas family children and Oded Lifshitz, the official said. Israel’s decision to delay the prisoner release stemmed from such incidents, which it views as an affront to national dignity, the official added. 'Our response to the murder of the Bibas family will be powerful. We have not forgotten. Right now, we are focused on the mission of returning the fallen hostages,' he said. Later Monday, a Hamas official said the terrorist group is insisting that Israel release the Palestinian prisoners before it hands over the four remaining fallen hostages. As negotiations continue, Israel has reiterated that it will pursue all its war objectives. According to the Israeli official, Hamas must choose between negotiating a second phase of the cease-fire that would lead to the release of all remaining hostages, the disarmament and demilitarization of Hamas, and the exile of its leaders under a model similar to the 1982 Beirut agreement. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: If Hamas agrees, the war could end. If Hamas rejects Israel’s terms, the military campaign will escalate with newly acquired weaponry following the lifting of an arms embargo. The official said the operation would continue with 'unprecedented U.S. support,' citing statements from senior Trump administration officials advocating for Hamas’ destruction. Another possibility is prolonging the current phase of the cease-fire with U.S. backing. Under this scenario, no full cease-fire would be declared unless additional hostages are released. Israel would seek the release of four fathers of young children, as well as hostages recently confirmed to be wounded or ill. A new negotiation framework would be established, with an understanding that Hamas would likely demand the release of additional prisoners and increased humanitarian aid to Gaza. To advance negotiations, White House envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff is expected to visit the region on Wednesday, with planned stops in Israel, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. In the meantime, he continues discussions with Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, who remains in the U.S. Both governments agree that Hamas must not retain control of Gaza in the next phase, according to an Israeli source. A delegation from Israel is expected to travel to Cairo or Doha in the coming days to discuss the various options, the source added. Meanwhile, Egyptian sources told the Qatari news outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that senior Egyptian officials see 'positive indications' for the start of negotiations on a second phase of the cease-fire agreement. They also suggested that the Trump administration is interested in securing the release of all hostages and avoiding a resumption of full-scale fighting in Gaza. According to the report, Israel’s security establishment is pressuring Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to move forward with a deal. Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem accused Israel of violating the cease-fire agreement by delaying the release of Palestinian prisoners. Speaking to Qatar’s Al-Araby network, he said the group was in talks with mediators about what he called an Israeli breach of the deal, with American backing. 'The prisoners must be released before any discussion of negotiations on the next phase,' Qassem said. 'Extending the first phase depends on what is on the table and on guarantees of Israel’s commitment. Serious assurances are needed from the mediators and even from the U.S. Israel has always refused to honor the agreements it signs.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk6uyrk9je	2025-02-24T03:05:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/22/BJ2qDNwckx/BJ2qDNwckx_0_95_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
EU and Israel resume dialogue with focus on Gaza's future	Foreign Minister Gideon Saar called for a constructive dialogue but braced for criticism from some European countries as he arrived for talks on Monday in Brussels. The Israeli minister is meeting senior European officials, reviving a dialogue with the European Union as the bloc considers a role in the reconstruction of Gaza following last month's fragile cease-fire deal. 'I'm looking for a constructive dialogue, an open and honest one, and I believe that this is what it will be,' Saar told reporters on arrival. 'We know how to face criticism,' he said, adding 'it's okay as long as the criticism is not connected to delegitimization, demonization, or double standards ... but we are ready to discuss everything with an open mind'. Saar will co-chair a meeting of the EU-Israel Association Council with EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas in the first such session since 2022. Talks are set to focus on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, Israeli-Palestinian relations and changing regional dynamics. The Israeli foreign minister said that within the EU 'there are very friendly countries, there are less friendly countries', but that Monday's meeting showed a willingness to renew normal relations.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syfcacf51x	2025-02-24T02:58:19-08:00	
Buenos Aires deputy mayor pushes to rename 'Palestine Street' aft...	Yamil Santoro proposes renaming 'Estado de Palestina' Street to honor Shiri and her children, Ariel and Kfir; initiative sparks both strong support and opposition, with legislative debate on proposal set for March 1 Buenos Aires Deputy Mayor Yamil Santoro is proposing to rename a city street in honor of an Argentine-Israeli family abducted and killed by their captors in Gaza, saying the October 7 attack was not just against Israel but against democracy and freedom. Santoro has introduced legislation to rename 'Estado de Palestina' (State of Palestine) Street in the Almagro neighborhood as 'Bibas Family Street' to commemorate Shiri Bibas and her two young children, Ariel and Kfir, who were abducted and later murdered in Gaza. 'The Bibas family is a worthy symbol to be commemorated,' Santoro told Ynet in an interview Monday. 'We thought it was appropriate to honor their memory, along with everyone who lost their lives or was harmed in the war against Hamas.' The proposal has drawn mixed reactions. Santoro said most residents support the initiative, with a Change.org petition gathering over 30,000 signatures in less than two days. However, some opponents believe a memorial or recognition should be created but not at the expense of Palestine Street. 'That is a fair point and will likely be debated in the local congress,' Santoro said. Others strongly object to the initiative, including 'radical left-wing factions' who claim the Bibas family was killed by Israeli airstrikes and 'far-right elements' who oppose the tribute altogether, he said. Beyond honoring the Bibas family, Santoro said his proposal is also about eliminating official recognition of the Palestinian Authority, which he argued is controlled by Hamas and Islamic Jihad. 'I don't think Buenos Aires should be recognizing such an entity,' he said. The proposal requires approval from a majority in the local congress, with discussions set to begin when the legislative session opens on March 1. Santoro, a longtime supporter of Israel, said the criticism he has faced over the initiative has been particularly intense. 'I've always stood with Israel and have been involved in similar debates,' he said. 'I'm part of Argentina’s forum against antisemitism, so I wasn’t completely surprised by the criticism.' However, he said this was the first time he had encountered such a concentrated wave of hostility. 'It was an eye-opening experience,' he said, adding that his team has worked to block and remove online accounts spreading hateful content. Santoro, who is not Jewish, described his connection to Israel as ideological, citing its role in countering Islamic extremism. 'If Israel weren’t there, the threat would spread to Europe and the rest of the Western world,' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He also defended Israel’s democratic values. 'Israel is the only democracy in the region, where people can live according to their beliefs and lifestyles,' he said. 'What happened on October 7 made it clear that the issue isn’t territory or politics — it’s pure hatred toward Israel.' Santoro was asked whether the name change initiative reflects Argentina’s shifting political climate under President Javier Milei, who has expressed strong support for Israel. 'Since Milei took office, discussions about Israel have become more public, which I see as a positive development,' he said. However, he stressed that his position predates the current government. 'Even before Milei proposed moving Argentina’s embassy to Jerusalem, I was the first to call on our Foreign Ministry to do so — in 2018 and again in 2021 under President Alberto Fernández,' he said. 'So while I’m glad Milei supports this, my stance has not changed.' Santoro said he has not contacted the Bibas family directly but has reached out through mutual friends. 'I didn’t want to intrude, so I asked friends with connections to the family to let them know I’m available to talk,' he said. He added that if the family has concerns about renaming the street, he is open to alternative proposals, such as naming it in memory of all victims of the October 7 attack. Santoro's proposal faces a legal challenge: Buenos Aires law prohibits naming streets after individuals who have died less than 10 years ago. He is now working to amend the law to allow an exception in this case. The legislative debate is expected to take place in the coming weeks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkum8nf91g	2025-02-24T02:57:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/06/Hkf6tPJPw0/Hkf6tPJPw0_0_66_768_433_0_small.jpg

American ex-hostage Keith Siegel thanks Trump in video from ruins...	U.S. president shares former captive's video with his over 9 million followers on his Truth Social platform, in which Siegel stands in the ruins of Kfar Aza and thanks Trump for his efforts to secure the deal, stresses all hostages must return home Former hostage Keith Siegel sent a video to U.S. President Donald Trump, which Trump shared overnight on his social media platform Truth Social. Siegel filmed the video among the ruins of Kibbutz Kfar Aza, from where he was kidnapped on the morning of the October 7 massacre. 'Hello, Mr. President. My name is Keith Siegel, the first American hostage released in the deal that you worked so hard to set in place,' he said. 'Thank you once again for everything you’ve done to get the hostages out of Gaza.' Siegel, who told his family he suffered physical and psychological abuse in captivity, continued: 'I'm standing in front of a home in Kfar Aza, the kibbutz where I live. You can see the enormous destruction Hamas did on the October 7 massacre. 'It's hard to believe and comprehend what I'm seeing today — homes that were destroyed by Hamas, that were burned. People in the kibbutz were murdered, burned alive. Just horrific stories of what happened on that day are horrifying.' He stressed the urgency of securing the release of the remaining hostages amid negotiations on extending the deal’s first phase or advancing to the next phase. 'I wanted to say to you again how urgent it is to get all the hostages out of Gaza and back home to their families. You've done so much so far and we all urge you to continue your efforts and use your ability to allow more progress in the hostage exchange deals. Thank you.' According to Israeli estimates, 63 hostages remain in Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be alive and can still be saved. Some have provided proof of life through videos and testimony from freed hostages. At a rally in Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square last week, former hostage Aviva Siegel, Keith's wife, said: 'I know what it's like to be in Gaza and I know what it's like to worry about someone in Gaza. The suffering there is unbearable.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: She recalled her time in captivity. 'I didn’t let myself feel anything for a moment.

They must be brought back from this hell now!' Aviva added that Keith told her he was held alone for six months, sleeping on a mattress on the floor in a tiny room, surviving on moldy pita bread unfit for human consumption. 'One day, a terrorist with him kicked him full force in the ribs, spat on him and called him 'ya kalb' (Arabic for 'you dog') for no reason, just because he felt like it,' she said.

In interview with Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa TV, Bnei Sakhnin play-caller Saeed Hassanain called Arab Israelis who enlist in IDF 'weak-minded', says terror group treated hostages 'humanly and in accordance with Islamic law' Israeli soccer officials have condemned remarks made by Saeed Hassanain, the announcer for Bnei Sakhnin F.C.’s home games, following a controversial interview he gave to Al-Aqsa TV, a channel affiliated with Hamas and banned in Israel. Hassanain, who also broadcasts on the Israeli-Arab radio station A-Nas, made inflammatory statements against Israel, the IDF and even against recently released hostages. Regarding Omri Shem Tov, who was freed on Saturday and was forced to kiss the forehead of a Hamas operative during his 'release ceremony,' Hassanain claimed: 'He did it willingly because he respects and appreciates what the person holding him did and the dignity with which he was treated.' He further stated that female hostages were treated 'with respect according to Islamic law and were not harmed,' adding that this proves 'who is barbaric and who is humane, who acts according to religious and Islamic teachings.' Hassanain also denounced Arab Israelis who enlist in the IDF, calling them 'weak-minded' and saying Hamas wanted to send a message that they should not join the 'enemy army, the army of occupation.' He urged those considering enlistment to 'think a million times before selling their conscience, morals and religion for this immoral path.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Israeli Professional Football League sent a strongly worded letter to Bnei Sakhnin, signed by chairman Erez Kalfon. 'We were shocked by the outrageous, false and unacceptable statements made by Mr. Saeed Hassanain, who holds an official position within Bnei Sakhnin, as presented in his interview with Al-Aqsa TV — the television channel of the despicable terrorist organization Hamas,' the letter stated. 'These statements are, to say the least, unacceptable in Israeli society, and certainly in Israeli soccer.' 'Given the above, and before we take further concrete steps, Bnei Sakhnin Football Club is expected to immediately and unequivocally distance itself — both from these statements and from their speaker. Mr. Saeed Hassanain is no longer a welcome figure in professional Israeli soccer, and we expect a clear statement from Bnei Sakhnin on this matter. Nothing in this letter should be seen as limiting or exhausting the league's claims or actions, which remain fully reserved.' The Israeli advocacy group Betzalmo also sent a letter, co-signed by Israel Football Association chairman Shino Zuaretz, demanding Hassanain’s immediate dismissal. 'A Hamas supporter who refers to Israel as the enemy army cannot serve as Bnei Sakhnin's announcer,' the letter read. 'He claimed Hamas is humane and acts according to religion while Israel is barbaric and the enemy. He praised Hamas leaders.

UK lawmaker demands investigation into whether BBC transferred mo...	Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch calls for inquiry into national broadcaster over contentious documentary featuring son of senior Hamas official as protagonist Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative Party, has demanded an investigation into whether Hamas received payments from the nation’s public broadcasting channel BBC during the production of the documentary 'Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone,' which aired last week, the UK-based outlet Daily Mail reported on Monday. In a letter to BBC Director-General Tim Davie, Badenoch questioned whether UK taxpayers' money — funding the BBC in part through television license fees — ended up in the hands of the terrorist group. According to the outlet, she argued that the BBC's biased coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was not an 'isolated incident' and called for an end to its 'systemic and institutional bias against Israel.' She also threatened to withdraw her party’s support for the license fee unless 'serious action' was taken, including an investigation into senior BBC executives. 'It is now clear to me that you should commission a full independent inquiry to consider this and wider allegations of systemic BBC bias against Israel,' she said, noting that Hamas exerts significant control over Gaza and questioned how the BBC could commission a program from there without ensuring that presenters and participants were not affiliated with the 'appalling regime.' ''Would the BBC be this naive if it was commissioning content from North Korea or the Islamic Republic of Iran?' she added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The controversy erupted after independent journalist Dave Collier revealed that the film’s central figure, Abdullah Ayman al-Yazouri, is the son of senior Hamas official Ayman al-Yazouri, who currently serves as the terror group's agriculture minister. The information was not disclosed to viewers, despite al-Yazouri narrating the documentary. Initially, the BBC attempted to deflect responsibility by blaming London-based production company Hoyo Films, which allegedly failed to share details about al-Yazouri’s father. The BBC said it would add this information in future broadcasts, but contract details revealed that the broadcaster had been directly and consistently involved in the documentary's production. According to online news site Deadline, BBC journalists expressed concern over how the film aired without proper scrutiny. One described the situation as a 'terrible mess,' saying: 'It’s really weird that they got themselves into this position and didn’t see the problems coming.' A protest letter also noted that if the BBC’s claims were true, the film violated the broadcaster’s strict guidelines on working with minors under 18. Amid growing backlash — including a letter signed by nearly 50 senior figures in British media — the BBC announced it would temporarily remove the documentary from its digital platforms. A report published in September found that the BBC committed 1,500 violations related to Israel in its war coverage. 'The findings reveal a deeply worrying pattern of bias and multiple breaches by the BBC of its own editorial guidelines on impartiality, fairness and establishing the truth,' the report read. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry7yghtqyx	2025-02-24T01:18:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/07/09/BkEM6edKn/BkEM6edKn_297_0_2407_1355_0_small.jpg

Olmert reveals the 'napkin map': Former prime minister shows neve...	In new documentary, Ehud Olmert shows map he presented to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in 2008, which would have seen both parties exchange territory in and near West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem Former prime minister Ehud Olmert has revealed for the first time a map outlining a proposed Israeli-Palestinian peace deal that he presented to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in August 2008. The map, which had never been disclosed until now, was part of Olmert’s offer for a two-state solution. Abbas, Olmert said, had to sketch the proposal onto a napkin during their meeting. 'For the next 50 years, you won’t find a single Israeli leader who will offer you what I’m offering now,' Olmert recalled telling Abbas in an interview for the documentary 'Israel and the Palestinians – The Road to October 7.' Olmert said he urged Abbas to sign the agreement immediately. 'I told him, ‘Sign this, sign this now!’' The plan included Israel annexing 4.9% of the West Bank, while ceding an equivalent amount of land to a future Palestinian state, which would have been granted sovereignty over more than 94% of the territory. As part of the proposal, Israel would have connected the West Bank to the Gaza Strip – already under Hamas control at the time – via a tunnel or highway. Olmert recalled Abbas’ reaction to the offer, saying the Palestinian leader responded: 'Prime Minister, this is very serious. Very, very serious.' Abbas later claimed in interviews with Israeli media that, had negotiations continued, he believed a deal could have been reached 'within two months.' The plan would have allowed Israel to retain its major settlement blocs, including Maale Adumim, Ariel and Kedumim, but required the evacuation of dozens of smaller settlements throughout the West Bank and the Jordan Valley. Olmert’s proposal also sought to address the division of Jerusalem, one of the most contentious issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Under the plan, each side could have claimed parts of the city as its capital, while a 'trusteeship committee' consisting of Israel, the Palestinians, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United States would have overseen the administration of the Old City and its religious sites. Olmert said he never gave Abbas a copy of the proposed map and insisted the Palestinian leader could only receive it if he signed the agreement on the spot. Abbas refused, saying he needed to consult with his advisers. 'We parted ways as if we were about to make history,' Olmert said. However, Abbas’ then-chief of staff, Rafiq al-Husseini, described a different reaction in the documentary. He said that after the meeting the Palestinian delegation laughed in the car on the way back. He argued that Olmert’s political situation — he had already announced plans to resign amid corruption investigations — meant the offer was unlikely to be implemented. 'No matter how nice he was, Olmert was a lame duck,' al-Husseini said. 'We knew this wasn’t going anywhere.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The situation in Gaza also complicated the peace process. Months after the proposal, Israel launched a military offensive, Operation Cast Lead, following repeated rocket attacks from the Strip. Olmert maintains that Abbas missed a historic opportunity. 'It would have been very smart of Abbas to sign this,' he said. Had the Palestinian leader accepted the plan, Olmert argued, any future Israeli prime minister who sought to revoke it would have borne full responsibility for the failure of the peace process. Months later, in February 2009, Israel held elections that brought Benjamin Netanyahu—then and now prime minister — back to power. Olmert’s proposal and map, the documentary’s creators note, became a historical footnote. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rke7jjyqjl	2025-02-24T00:11:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2020/02/11/9780106/9780106_0_136_1300_732_0_small.jpg

Friedrich Merz is a stalwart Israel ally | Meet Germany's next ch...	CDU leader vowed to lift restrictions on German arms exports to Jerusalem and criticized both outgoing chancellor Olaf Scholz and Biden administration for policies during the war Friedrich Merz, who led the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) to victory in Germany’s general elections on Sunday with nearly a third of the votes, is expected to become the country’s next chancellor. His leadership is seen as a positive development for Israel. Merz is considered a strong supporter of Israel and, before the elections, pledged to lift restrictions on arms exports to the country and maintain close ties between the two nations. According to the preliminary results published overnight, Merz’s Christian Democratic bloc secured 28.6% of the votes, while the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party came in second with 20.8% — the highest result for an extreme right-wing party in Germany since World War II. The center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), led by outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, collapsed to 16.4%. The Greens secured 11.6%, while the far-left Die Linke party achieved a significant gain with 8.8%. Merz, 69, was born in West Germany to a family of lawyers and politicians, with his father having served as a judge in several Nazi trials. He earned a law degree in 1985 and was appointed a judge soon after but left the judiciary within a year to become a legal advisor in the chemical industry. His political career began in 1989 when he was elected to the European Parliament, and in 1994 he entered the Bundestag. Over the next 15 years, he became the CDU’s top authority on financial and budgetary policy. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In the early 2000s, Merz attempted to challenge Angela Merkel for party leadership but lost. He became one of the first casualties of her political purge, in which she sidelined male rivals. In 2009, he left politics and turned to business, becoming a multi-millionaire through his work as a corporate lawyer and board member of major companies. He also obtained a pilot’s license and purchased two private planes. Merz returned to politics in 2018 after Merkel announced she would not seek another term. In 2021, following the CDU’s election defeat, he was elected party leader on his third attempt. Since then, he has worked to return the conservatives to power and distance the CDU from Merkel’s political legacy while appealing to centrist voters. 'With Israel, no ifs or buts' Merz is known as an unwavering supporter of Israel. Following the October 7 attack, he visited both southern and northern Israel and criticized outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz for allowing a de facto arms embargo on Israel. Merz vowed that under his government, there would be no such restrictions and also condemned the Biden administration’s policies toward Israel during the war. Additionally, Merz announced that he would invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to visit Germany despite the International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant against him. His party has pledged to continue viewing Israel as a 'raison d’être' — a fundamental reason for Germany’s existence. While Merz supports a two-state solution, he insists that Palestinians must first recognize Israel’s right to exist. In the past, he has stated that 'Germany’s relationship with Israel is unique — no ifs or buts,' and in October 2023, he declared that Germany would not grant asylum to Palestinians because, in his words, 'Germany already has too many antisemites.' Beyond his stance on Israel, Merz’s policies focus on a strict approach to domestic issues in Germany. He advocates limiting immigration and closing the country’s doors to illegal migrants. A month ago, after an illegal Afghan migrant killed a toddler in a stabbing attack, Merz reacted emotionally and attempted to push anti-immigration legislation in cooperation with AfD. This move broke a post-World War II political taboo, as mainstream parties in Germany have traditionally refused to collaborate with the far-right. The gamble cost him dearly: the law was not passed, hundreds of thousands protested against him, the far-left Die Linke gained renewed support, and the conservatives lost 2-3% in the polls. A clear commitment: No government with AfD On economic policy, Merz aims to cut unemployment benefits for 1.7 million citizens whom he claims are capable of working but choose not to. In foreign policy, he is a staunch supporter of the European Union and NATO, yet in response to Donald Trump’s recent actions, he has emphasized his goal of seeking greater independence for Germany. Now, following his victory, Merz faces the challenge of forming a government coalition. Despite the decisive win, he will need to partner with more moderate parties to establish a stable government. He has repeatedly promised not to include Alternative for Germany in his coalition — especially since Israel officially boycotts the party. If he breaks this commitment and includes the far-right AfD, it could pose a significant challenge for Israel, given the party’s opposition to Holocaust remembrance. On Sunday night, Merz reaffirmed his pledge to keep AfD out. Following Merz's victory, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated him on X: 'Congratulations to Friedrich Merz and the Christian Democratic Union on their decisive election victory tonight. I look forward to working closely with the new government to further strengthen the partnership between our countries.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/ry7f79t9jl	2025-02-23T22:46:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/02/12/HylJURuwj6/HylJURuwj6_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Pope Francis, in critical condition battling double pneumonia, had a 'good' night in hospital, slept and is resting, the Vatican said on Monday. The pope was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on February 14 after having trouble breathing for several days and subsequently had pneumonia diagnosed in both lungs.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyukljtqkg	2025-02-23T22:32:33-08:00	
Freed hostages reveal signs of life from those still held by Hama...	Twenty-five hostages have been released in first phase of Gaza cease-fire deal, bringing crucial signs of life from others still held by Hamas, but negotiations on Phase II remain uncertain; Families continue to push for comprehensive agreement as reports emerge of injured and ailing captives Twenty-five hostages have returned alive in various phases of the first stage of the hostage deal, bringing with them signs of life from many still held by Hamas. However, the continuation of the deal remains uncertain. After Israel decided to delay the release of 620 Palestinian prisoners on Saturday 'until the next hostages are secured and without humiliating ceremonies,' the final round of Phase 1 — retrieval of the bodies of four hostages — is now in question. If the issue is resolved and the exchange proceeds, the remains of Shlomo Mansour, Itzik Elgart, Ohad Yahalomi and Tzachi Idan are expected to be returned. This would leave 59 living and killed hostages still in Hamas captivity. Despite calls from many hostage families to secure their release in a single phase, Israel may seek to extend Phase 1 with additional humanitarian exchanges. These could include the release of four fathers of young children — David Cunio, Omri Miran, Elkanah Buhbut, and Maxim Herkin — alongside injured or ill hostages whose conditions were recently revealed through testimonies of freed captives. Of the 59 hostages not included in the first phase, 35 are no longer alive. Most of the remaining 24 have been confirmed to be alive. One of the latest and most harrowing pieces of evidence came from a Hamas video showing Avitar David and Guy Gilboa Dalal watching their fellow captives being released and pleading for their own freedom. Other Hamas videos, released about two months ago, showed signs of life from Matan Tsangauker —whose mother, Einav, received a cynical 'gift' from Hamas in the form of an hourglass with their photos —and from Idan Alexander, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen. US envoy Steve Witkoff has stated that securing Alexander’s release is a priority for the United States. Most other signs of life have come through freed hostages. Alon Ohel’s family was informed that he is chained and has an eye injury. He had been held for an extended period with Eli Sharabi, Or Levy and Eliya Cohen, who have since been released. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: A message was relayed from Elkanah Buhbut himself to his wife and son, and freed hostages reported that he is injured. Additional signs of life have been received from Nimrod Cohen — who, according to a freed hostage, was held with him for eight months — as well as from twins Ziv and Gali Berman, David Cunio, Segev Kalfon, Yosef Haim Ohana, and Matan Angrest. Ruti Strom, mother of freed hostage Yair Horn, whose brother Eitan remains in Gaza and has been confirmed alive, said in an interview with Ynet: 'The first thing Yair said was that he wants to do everything to bring Eitan back. They were together almost the entire time.' She added that Eitan suffers from a skin condition, which likely worsened in the tunnels, where 'there is no air, no daylight, no showers, and no medical care. They are constantly trying to break them mentally. I know that [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu will do everything to bring them all home. That is what needs to happen for all of us to heal together. Eitan is strong. He is strong, and he will come back.' Tzvika Mor, father of hostage Eitan Mor, also spoke to Ynet, confirming they had received a sign of life from his son but no details on his condition. 'I’m not even sure this sign came from freed hostages. If someone had seen him, they would have reported on his condition, and we didn’t receive that information. Our demand from the government is that on the 42nd day — this coming Saturday — all the hostages return home. This is the time to leverage President [Donald] Trump’s credit and end this deal this weekend. No more trickles, no more selective releases. We cannot leave their fate in Hamas’ hands. When you negotiate, you are seen as weak, and Hamas is toying with us,' he said. At the same time, other families have been left in the dark for over 500 days. The mother of Avinatan Or said she has received no sign of life from her son but emphasized, 'I do not have the right to break.' Arbel Yehoud, who was held in Gaza alone for an extended period, was freed in the third phase of the deal, but no sign of life has been received from her partner, Ariel Cunio. The family of Maxim Herkin has also not reported receiving any confirmation that he is alive. Similarly, the family of Tamir Nimrodi has not received a sign of life since he was abducted from a coordination and liaison base near Gaza. The same goes for the relatives of Rom Breslavsky. The last sign of life from Omri Miran was in July, and Bar Kuperstein’s family also reported a sign of life received in the summer. In addition to the 22 Israeli hostages still considered alive, two foreign nationals — Bipin Joshi from Nepal and Netphong Pinta from Thailand — remain captive in Gaza, with no signs of life confirmed. Hamas is also holding the remains of 36 Israeli hostages, including Shlomo Mansour, who is expected to be returned this week, as well as Tamir Adar, Dror Or, Guy Ilouz, Master Sergeant Muhammad al-Atrash, Ronen Engel, Aviv Atzili, Uriel Baruch, Sahar Baruch, Sergeant First Class Ran Gweili, Meni Godard, Sergeant Oz Daniel, Inbar Heyman, Judy Weinstein, Ilan Weiss, Aryeh Zalmanovitz, Gadi Hagi, Tal Haymi, Colonel Asaf Hamami, Staff Sergeant Itay Chen, Yair Yaakov, Eitan Levy, Staff Sergeant Shai Levinson, Eliyahu Margalit ('Churchill'), Captain Omer Neutra, Yonatan Semrano, Captain Daniel Peretz, Amiram Kuper, Ofra Kidar, Lior Rodaif, Yossi Sharabi, and Idan Shtivi. Also held by Hamas are the remains of First Lieutenant Hadar Goldin, who fell during Operation Protective Edge in 2014, as well as three foreign nationals—Joshua Luito Mollel from Tanzania and Sontiya Oukrasri and Sontisak Rintalak from Thailand. As negotiations remain uncertain, families continue to demand answers and push for the return of their loved ones. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/ryjj3tf91l	2025-02-23T22:22:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/14/HJ75ri4maR/HJ75ri4maR_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Despite promises of financing and rebuilding, Metula is a ravaged...	For 1st time since October 7 all security restrictions have been lifted in communities near the border with Lebanon, but the reality for Metula's residents is a decimated town, not the least bit ready to absorb families; Damage from Hezbollah's year-long onslaught has left people clueless as to when normal life will resume We entered the neglected yard of an old stone house, carefully avoiding the sharp spikes of the barbed wire stretched across the property. A sign at the front of the house tells its story: this is the 'Arch House,' built in an Arab style in 1900. Its construction sparked heated debates among those who wanted the colony's houses to be built in a European style with tiled roofs and those who sought to blend into the environment by building homes typical of the Levant, with arches and domes. These were the arguments of that time. No one could have imagined back then that, over a century later, Metula would become a military outpost facing Lebanon. Fences would stretch across yards, and sandbags would line shooting positions at street corners. Today, Metula still bears the scars of war. Two and a half months after the cease-fire on the northern border, the town remains in a state resembling a military outpost. IDF troops have withdrawn from southern Lebanon except for five key outposts. Meanwhile, the army uses Metula as though the war has not ended, with soldiers visible throughout the town. The government has announced that northern residents evacuated from their homes will return to their communities by March 1. However, none of the ministers have visited the north to assess whether this is even feasible. On Sunday evening, the IDF announced the lifting of restrictions in the north, the first step in returning residents to their communities. It is the first time since October 7 that all security restrictions have been lifted in communities near the border with Lebanon. Meanwhile, at the end of the month the government will stop distributing the alternative housing grants it has paid to more than 60,000 evacuees from the north. The Arch House on Rishonim Street serves as one example. A rocket struck its backyard, destroying the porch and igniting a fire that consumed everything there. On the ground, we found discarded ZAKA vests (Search & Rescue organization) and kits for police volunteers. From Rishonim Street, we drove to Lebanon Street, where almost every house sustained damage. Though residents are supposed to return, most homes are abandoned, with some doors left wide open. No repair crews were seen in the area. A completely burned pickup truck still sits unattended. On the parallel Hermon Street, across from the Katz family home, the sidewalk is piled high with furniture and belongings. The massive pile contains the contents of four houses, according to Orit Katz. She reassures us that the local council will eventually remove it. Katz, a fourth-generation resident of the colony, explains that her grandfather Pesach Winkler came here with his father, Menashe, from Petah Tikva to establish this place. Pointing to house number 14 on the street, she says: 'My husband Kobi and I built this house 50 years ago when we got married. We’ve lived here for 50 years until the war. The house didn’t take a direct hit, but rockets hit neighboring houses, blowing out all our doors, shattering the windows, and ripping off the roof. Rain poured into the house, ruining all the furniture.' Will you manage to renovate by March 1? 'There’s a lot of work to do. When the cease-fire began, my husband immediately came to see what happened to the house. I couldn’t bring myself to look. This is only my second time back, and again, we’re here just to figure out what to do next. My first visit since the evacuation was two and a half weeks ago. I stood at the entrance and couldn’t believe it was my house. I didn’t recognize it—really, I didn’t. How can they expect us to return home by March 1?' Life as an evacuee On the way to Metula, we called Mai Shitrit from Kiryat Shmona. The last time we spoke to her, the day after the cease-fire began in November, she was staying at a hotel on the Tel Aviv promenade. She, her husband, and their two young children — one two years old and the other barely a year — were crammed into a tiny hotel room. Shitrit described life in the hotel as unbearable due to the severe overcrowding. They had purchased three plastic storage cabinets, a refrigerator, a toaster, a Ninja pot, and frying pans to cook in their small room because they could no longer stand the hotel food. When asked where they cooked, she replied, 'On the balcony overlooking the sea.' We assumed by now she and her family had returned to Kiryat Shmona. After all, life in a hotel becomes intolerable after a year and a half, and the government’s plan to encourage residents to return includes financial compensation: $4,330 per adult and $2,165 per child for those who return by March 7. Until then, residents can use the funds to prepare their homes for return. 'We haven’t gone back,' she said. 'You caught me organizing the mess in the hotel room in Tel Aviv. It’s a nightmare here — wow, you wouldn’t believe how bad it is. But there are no active childcare facilities in Kiryat Shmona. Here, the kids are in a daycare for evacuees in Kerem HaTeimanim, run by three women from Kiryat Shmona who aren’t professional caregivers. One owns a grocery store, another a sandwich kiosk, and the third works in a clothing store. They’ve already told us they’re closing the daycare on the 20th of the month to prepare for their return to Kiryat Shmona. 'Two and a half months have passed since the cease-fire, and no one has contacted us to ease our concerns. No one has told me whether childcare services will even be available in Kiryat Shmona by March 1. I’m afraid to go back. On one hand, I want to return home, but on the other, I’m terrified. I need someone to tell me it’s safe to go back to Kiryat Shmona. Right now, nothing is clear.' Barriers to education and reconstruction The Ministry of Education announced this week that only 70% of teachers in evacuated communities have confirmed they will return to teach in the north. This complicates the reopening of educational institutions in Kiryat Shmona and other towns at the beginning of next month, casting doubt on the possibility of a full return to schooling in the coming year. This adds another consideration for evacuees: those who leave hotels or rented homes will receive the maximum compensation. However, those who choose to stay in temporary accommodations will face financial penalties. The longer they delay returning home, the smaller the government payout — eventually reaching zero if they wait until the end of the school year. David Azulay, head of the Metula local council, hired a lawyer to petition the Supreme Court on behalf of the council and residents, demanding that the government delay the return date for evacuees. Azulay’s office is still located in one of the shelters in the colony because the council building was hit by a rocket and has yet to be repaired, just like many other damaged buildings in the colony. 'Take a look around,' he says, 'see for yourselves and then come back and tell me if this is a place people can return to. Metula has 2,400 residents, but only 18 have returned. What, the rest don’t want to come back? They’re dying to come back! But you can’t imagine what’s going on here — the amount of garbage we’ve been clearing out is unimaginable. Just in the past two and a half months, it equals what we’d usually remove in two years. 'A house that has been infested by rats for a year and four months is a ruined house. A house with broken windows, missing tiles, and rainwater pouring in, filling it with mold and mildew — that’s a ruined house. Everything has to be thrown out, and new furniture needs to be purchased. So people are emptying their homes onto the sidewalks. The amount of garbage is insane, and we’re working around the clock with a contractor who brings a loader and a double-trailer truck, and it’s still not enough.' Rehabilitation delays Still, here we are, two and a half months after the cease-fire took effect, about two weeks before the scheduled return date, and it doesn’t seem like much progress has been made in repairs and rehabilitation. 'There are still a lot of soldiers here, a massive military presence. You see tank carriers, fuel trucks, jeeps. The reservists themselves come in private vehicles. I’m talking about hundreds of reservists — hundreds. They leave their cars everywhere, and it disrupts our work. In several cases, we’ve asked the army to identify the owners of cars blocking access for contractors who came to repair infrastructure. The army got back to us and said, ‘We checked, the car owners are inside Lebanon, they’ll move them as soon as they come out.’ They’re still inside, and we’re still waiting. 'Residents bring contractors and repairmen to get price estimates and then tell me, ‘What is this, David? Metula looks like a military base.’ Who wants to live on an army base? What, did we sign up for permanent service? The army has spread barbed wire throughout the community and set up shooting positions with sandbag reinforcements, and they haven’t removed any of it. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'There are openings in the border fence that the army created to allow tanks and trucks through. Do you know how many stray Lebanese dogs come through those openings? We have a dog catcher who now works full time chasing them. And the most frustrating thing is that there are no educational institutions. The school was hit by a rocket and is under repair. The kindergartens housed hundreds of soldiers and now need renovations. It’s the same with the daycare center. The community center suffered blast damage and isn’t ready either. Some 95 children attended our elementary school, 38 went to kindergartens, and 32 toddlers were in the daycare center. These children are now enrolled in schools in other communities. If nothing is ready here, why would these families come back? What a stupid country!' Staying behind in Metula Zehava Neishtain never left Metula, not even for a single day. At 78 years old, she was born in Haifa and has lived here for over 50 years. Her late husband, Ehud, was a fourth-generation descendant of the colony’s founders. She owns a guesthouse with seven rooms, where for several months reservists stayed. 'Every time there was a warning, they’d run to the shelter,' she says, 'and I’d watch them running while I stayed seated. I’ve never gone to a shelter in all my time in Metula, and I’ve been here since 1969.' Her daughter, Miri Armon, has had a very different experience. Miri, 47, married a farmer from the Gadera area who followed her to Metula. Together, they grow kiwis, avocados, nectarines, and pecans. They have a house here and three children, but when the war broke out, they left immediately. First, they stayed with family in Ramat Hasharon, then moved to a one-bedroom apartment in Kibbutz Dalia. From there, they fled to a hotel in Haifa, then to a hotel in Tiberias, which they later replaced with another hotel in Tiberias. For almost a year now, they’ve been living in a rented house in Yesod Hama’ala. Since the cease-fire, they’ve been chasing after state authorities. 'Our house was damaged by the blast of an anti-tank missile that hit our neighbor’s house,' Miri says. 'Doors, tiles and windows were blown off, cracks formed in some walls, air conditioners were destroyed, and the house was left exposed to rats. In short, it needs massive repairs.' Have you started renovations? 'We brought in an appraiser who works with the Tax Authority’s property damage division. At the same time, we brought our own contractor to review the damages with the appraiser and understand the scope of the work. The appraiser wrote a report and said he’d submit it to the property damage division, and they’d contact us. The contractor gave us a quote of 120,000 shekels, but we haven’t heard anything from the property damage division, so we can’t start renovations because we don’t have that kind of money.' Do you even know what the appraiser’s damage assessment was? 'Nothing. There’s a hotline for the property damage division, but no one answers. I’ve tried several times. I turned to the council’s lawyer, who’s helping residents deal with the property damage division, but even he has trouble getting answers. In the meantime, we hired a private lawyer to handle it. It’s been almost three months since we could have started fixing the house, but nothing’s moving. I haven’t heard a word from the state — not a single word!' Zehava adds: 'What a mess this is. In the south, they have the Tkumah Administration that helps residents of the Gaza envelope, but for us in the north, there’s no one to turn to, no address.' There’s Minister Ze’ev Elkin, who’s responsible for rehabilitating the north. Zehava: 'Where is he? Has anyone seen him?' The Tax Authority claims that 'out of more than 400 claims in Metula alone, over 70% have progressed to the payment stage. This is a relatively fast processing pace, considering that most residents are still evacuated.' We went to take photos in Zehava’s yard, now full of colorful anemones. Miri mentioned she wants to return to Metula. 'I have a family legacy here that goes back to the early days of Zionism,' she said. 'I really want to come back. I’m not ashamed to say I’m motivated by Zionism — by staying rooted to the land and to agriculture. But where is the state? We can’t do this alone.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hyayier91l	2025-02-23T21:51:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/13/SyNNt0wstkl/SyNNt0wstkl_161_449_2478_1395_0_small.jpg

Trump administration eliminating 1,600 USAID jobs in the US	President Donald Trump's administration said on Sunday it was placing all personnel at the foreign assistance agency USAID, except leaders and critical staff, on paid administrative leave and eliminating 1,600 positions in the United States. Billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has led an effort to gut the U.S. Agency for International Development, the main delivery mechanism for American foreign assistance and a critical tool of U.S. 'soft power' for winning influence abroad. 'I regret to inform you that you are affected by a Reduction in Force action,' said an email sent to one of the workers being fired that was reviewed by Reuters. Those who got the note will be let go from federal service effective April 24, the email said. USAID said on its website that just before midnight on Sunday U.S. Eastern Time, all direct hires except essential workers will be put on leave and 1,600 USAID personnel in the U.S. would be cut.

Planting hope: Volunteers, students unite in Kibbutz Magen	Danni Kaplan: 'I always think about what the future is going to be like... and I see these kids, and they’re natural-born leaders. They just tell you what to do' An incredible bond is forming outside a school in Kibbutz Magen. They may not be the same age, come from the same country, or share the same life experiences, but dozens of volunteers from JNF-USA and students from one of the four main schools in the Eshkol region are working together—planting trees, building connections, and restoring hope. 'For all of us, what we’re doing is giving back,' said Danni Kaplan, a volunteer with JNF-USA. 'I’m sitting here with my mouth open. And I always think about what the future is going to be like... and I see these kids, and they’re natural-born leaders. They just tell you what to do.' The effort is in full swing as the group plants dozens of trees in Kibbutz Magen, located just three kilometers from the Gaza border. 'First of all, we’re putting something beautiful in front of a wall—something that is necessary but is concrete. And the trees are the trees of life,' added Joanne Ditchik, another JNF-USA volunteer. The massive wall, built after October 7, was designed to provide greater protection for students attending the school. But beyond security, the community also wanted to bring life and beauty to the space—hence the tree planting. 'Trees—like the tree of life,' said Ditchik. 'It shows hope. It shows life.' According to Lior Daffner, Vice President of the Eshkol Regional Council, the wall was constructed to prevent anti-tank and other missiles from reaching the kibbutz, as they did during the war. 'The next question that parents and educators asked after October 7—which was a Saturday—was, ‘What would have happened if it was the next day?’' Daffner explained. 'We have 2,400 students here on a regular day, and the things that could have happened are beyond imagination.' The wall, with a clear view of Gaza behind it, is a critical layer of protection for families returning to rebuild their lives after October 7. 'We are planting trees in front of the wall, which is actually next to our school, to hide what’s going on behind it, you could say,' noted Ella, a student. 'And everyone here—from Sunday to Friday—is working together. I think we’re planting to make it as good and beautiful as possible.' Life in the region is just minutes away from an active warzone, but volunteers and community members say reinvesting in the land is a core value in the region. 'Working with the community is the right way to work, and we’re so connected to JNF,' added Daffner. 'Planting trees in our own land, in a way, is recovering—getting back to the place where we were born.' Ditchik summed it up beautifully: 'The people here have heart, and they live from their heart… what’s more beautiful than heart-to-heart human connection?'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj5b3wy51l	2025-02-23T18:52:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/24/HkeJTDtqkx/HkeJTDtqkx_104_1_603_339_0_small.jpg
U.S. expected to fully support Israel if fighting resumes in Gaza...	Col. (Ret.) Rich Outzen: 'With the Trump office, I suspect whatever his reservations and whatever his tempering language and maybe even criticism at some points, you'll still see full military support' If Israel is forced to resume fighting against Hamas in Gaza, the U.S. is expected to provide full support, according to Col. (Ret.) Rich Outzen, Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council. He told ILTV that even under the previous administration of President Joe Biden, the amount of military aid and ammunition that was withheld from Israel was 'very, very minor.'

An appropriate response': US supports Israel's delay of Palestin...	Spokesperson says Trump supports Israel in every step it decides to take against Hamas; Remarks follow Israel's decision to delay the release from prison of 620 terrorists over violations in last hostage handovers The White House on Sunday called Israel’s decision to delay the Palestinian prisoner release following Hamas’ violation of the cease-fire agreement after the handover of a Palestinian woman’s body instead of that of Shiri Bibas 'an appropriate response' and said U.S. President Donald Trump supports it. White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes told Ynet that 'given Hamas’ barbaric treatment of the hostages, including the hideous parade of the Bibas children’s coffins through the streets of Gaza, Israel’s decision to delay the release of prisoners is an appropriate response. The president is prepared to support Israel in whatever course of action it chooses regarding Hamas. The terror group’s official Basem Naim warned that the organization wouldn’t negotiate further cease-fire terms via mediators unless Palestinian prisoners were released as agreed. Senior Hamas member Mahmoud Mardawi echoed this, saying: 'There will be no talks with the enemy at any stage before the release of Palestinian prisoners that Israel agreed to free in exchange for the six Israeli captives. Mediators must force Israel to honor the agreement.' Meanwhile, the Commission of Detainees' Affairs & Palestinian Society Prisoners accused Israel of 'deliberately stalling' the seventh prisoner release in the deal and committing 'terror against prisoners and their families.' It added that 'There is no release set as of now.' Earlier, Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said he would visit the region this week, likely on Wednesday, and added, 'I expect Phase II to be implemented.' In an interview with CNN, he said, 'Netanyahu is motivated by the right reasons — Hamas cannot be part of any government in Gaza.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Witkoff added: 'We first need to extend Phase I. We hope to have enough time to start Phase II and finish it in order to release as many hostages as possible and advance the talks.' When asked whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to continue the deal or resume fighting in Gaza, he replied: 'I believe the prime minister wants to see hostages released — that’s certain. He also wants to protect Israeli citizens. He has a red line — Hamas cannot govern Gaza when this war ends. We’re trying to square the circle.' The hostage and cease-fire’s first phase is set to conclude this week, with four deceased hostages scheduled for release on Thursday. Of the 33 hostages included in this phase, Shlomo Mansour, Ohad Yahalomi, Tsachi Idan, and Itzik Elgart remain in captivity. If the first phase is not extended, it will end once the remains of these hostages are positively identified. Despite the crisis, Israel is preparing for a possible extension of Phase I, which would prioritize four fathers alongside injured or ill hostages whose conditions were only recently confirmed through testimonies from released captives. A lengthy discussion on the terms is expected to take place before any extension takes place about how many Palestinian prisoners will be freed in exchange for the next hostages. This could allow for two or three additional releases, possibly coinciding with Ramadan, a period during which Hamas has no interest in resuming fighting. However, extending releases in stages contradicts the wishes of many families whose loved ones — both living and deceased — were excluded from Phase I. These families are demanding a single release for all. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkm78zk9yg	2025-02-23T13:50:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/05/HJ5F9hlFke/HJ5F9hlFke_481_0_2040_1149_0_small.jpg
Bibas funeral set for Wednesday; family invites public to join pr...	Bibas family asks Knesset members to refrain from attending funeral, shiva ; Family thanks public for their support, saying 'the fight is not over,' while urging efforts to free the remaining hostages; Wednesday’s funeral will be private; Family swings from 'immense joy at Yarden's return to unfathomable grief and shock over the murder of Shiri and the children' The Bibas family will be laid to rest on Wednesday, as the entire nation mourns their loss. 'Last night, our personal journey as a family to bring Yarden, Shiri, Ariel and Kfir home came to an end,' said Ofri Bibas, Yarden Bibas' sister, on Sunday after the official identification revealed Shiri, Kfir and Ariel were murdered in captivity in Gaza. 'It ended in the most horrific and painful way. In the span of two weeks, we went from immense joy at Yarden's return to unfathomable grief and shock over the murder of Shiri and the children,' she added. Ofri described the family's emotional turmoil over the past 16 months as 'beyond words' and said the reality of the tragedy would take time to process. 'Now we begin a new battle — for healing, for rebuilding, for recovery. It will be long and difficult,' she said. She also noted that Yarden was still adjusting to the public attention surrounding his family, calling it 'overwhelming and even frightening.' While he has been deeply moved by the outpouring of support, she said, he is still struggling to come to terms with his loss. 'He swings between emotions — relief that he survived the nightmare and unbearable sorrow for losing everything that was home to him. He often wonders how Shiri would have handled this, but Shiri isn’t here to face it with him,' she said. 'For Shiri, for Yarden, and for all of us, we ask that people respect the nature of the funeral and mourning period as we have chosen.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ofri paid tribute to her sister-in-law, describing her as 'a loving mother, the perfect partner to Yarden, a friend who was always there for everyone.' She added: 'Shiri, we will miss you so much. We will always remember how you wrapped everyone in love, just as you embraced Ariel and Kfir on that terrible day — protective, full of life, always with a quiet smile that lit up the room. We are so sorry we weren’t there for you. The only comfort we have is that you are finally home.' Yarden, she said, has been touched by the messages of support, both online and in person. 'He wants people to know — they are not the ones who need to apologize. The apology owed to Shiri, Ariel and Kfir must come in the form of bringing the remaining hostages home. Our fight is not over. Sixty-three people are still in captivity. If they are not returned immediately, we will lose more lives. We cannot properly lay our fallen to rest while they remain there. Only when they all come home can healing begin.' In a statement, the Bibas family expressed deep gratitude for the overwhelming support they have received. 'In these painful days, there are no words to express the immense appreciation we feel toward all of you. Your warm embrace, love, and strength — from across Israel and the world — have carried us through our darkest hours. We feel your open hearts, your pain alongside ours, and it is not taken for granted.' Acknowledging the desire of many to pay their respects, the family said that due to space limitations and their wish for an intimate farewell, the funeral itself will be a private ceremony for close family and invited guests only. However, they plan to release details about the funeral procession route so that those who wish to honor Shiri, Ariel and Kfir can do so along the way. They are also working to provide a way for the public to view the eulogies remotely. 'We thank you from the bottom of our hearts — for your love, for your embrace, for the tears we all share. Words are not enough to express our gratitude for what you have given us in this moment. Please respect our choice to say goodbye in a way that feels right for us. Knowing you are with us, that your hearts beat alongside ours, gives us strength with every breath we take,' the statement read, signed by Yarden Bibas, Dana Seaton Silverman, and the entire family. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister’s Office informed government ministers that the Bibas family has requested that ministers and members of Knesset refrain from attending the funeral and shiva mourning period. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk11szwfqyl	2025-02-23T13:01:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/06/Hkf6tPJPw0/Hkf6tPJPw0_0_31_768_432_0_small.jpg
Israel increases alert in Gaza border communities as decision on ...	IDF says it increased readiness in the Gaza border region ahead of next weekend, when a decision will be made on whether the cease-fire will continue or fighting will resume The IDF announced Sunday that it has increased military readiness and operational preparedness in the Gaza border region following a security assessment. However, the IDF stated that there are no changes to Home Front Command guidelines at this time. The increased alert level comes amid intelligence warnings and ongoing deliberations over whether cease-fire negotiations will continue into next weekend or if hostilities will resume. In response, the IDF is adjusting troop deployments in the buffer zone and reinforcing defensive positions in the western Negev. Meanwhile, combat brigades continue preparations for a possible large-scale ground incursion should the negotiations collapse. Despite heightened military activity, the IDF clarified that 'no approach to the border fence has been detected.' The Eshkol Regional Council also issued a statement to reassure residents: 'Following media reports, we emphasize that there is no infiltration event in the Gaza border area — only an increase in readiness. There are no changes to civilian directives. We are in continuous contact with the military and will provide updates as necessary.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The announcement follows an incident two weeks ago when, just hours after the IDF withdrew from the Netzarim corridor, several dozen Gaza residents were seen within a few hundred meters of the border fence near Nahal Oz. According to cease-fire terms, Israel is supposed to maintain control over a 700-meter-wide buffer zone. However, residents of Israeli border communities reported that Gazans were spotted much closer to the fence. In response, Israeli forces opened fire, killing three Palestinians and wounding at least six others. The IDF said it used drones and live fire to push the group back, describing them as unarmed civilians scavenging near the ruins of the Netzarim corridor. While the individuals retreated after the gunfire, they did not appear to be attempting to rush the fence. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkma8gfq1x	2025-02-23T12:40:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/09/ByMLrDfIYJx/ByMLrDfIYJx_336_726_1743_981_0_small.jpg
He's not a human being, he doesn't speak and has no memory' | Hi...	Relatives of six released hostages thank Israeli officials and IDF soldiers for efforts and call to return all hostages; Hisham al-Sayed's father criticized Hamas over his son's poor condition after decade in Gaza: 'Hamas played politics on the back of a mentally ill man' A day after the release of six Israeli hostages as part of the first phase of the cease-fire deal, the former captives’ families spoke at press conferences held in the Israeli hospitals currently treating the returnees. Shaaban, father of Hisham al-Sayed, who was held by Hamas since April 2015, expressed his anger at his son's condition. 'We were afraid we'd get him back unable to stand, but when we saw him walking to the Red Cross vehicle, we were relieved,' he said. 'But when I hugged him, I felt I was hugging something that isn't a person. He can't speak, he has no memory, he doesn't know anything. Hamas played politics on the back of a mentally ill man.' He criticized Hamas for how they treated his son and called on negotiators to speed up efforts to return all of the hostages. 'I’m willing to sit with Hamas members anywhere, even on Al Jazeera, to prove he wasn’t a soldier,' he added. 'They didn’t want the world to see him because it would expose their lies.' Ilan, brother of Avera Mengistu, who was held captive since September 2014, spoke about his emotional return. 'Our beloved Avera is home. Words can’t describe how we feel,' he said. 'This is a moment of hope and light amid the pain and suffering since October 7. But recovery is a long and difficult process. We'll do everything to help him heal and find his place again.' He urged continued efforts to bring back the remaining hostages. 'Behind the joy of returning hostages are deep physical and emotional scars,' he warned. 'We must pressure decision-makers to bring everyone back now.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: At Sheba Medical Center, families of four additional freed hostages — Omer Shem Tov, Omer Wenkert, Tal Shoham and Eliya Cohen — also shared their experiences. Sheli Shem Tov, Omer’s mother, paid tribute to Ori Danino, who was murdered in captivity after trying to rescue her son and others on October 7. 'Ori is the hero and my son’s guardian angel,' she said. She described Omer's ordeal: 'The 450 days alone in a tunnel, suffering starvation and psychological abuse. His only wish was to lay his head on my lap and feel human warmth again.' She recounted how, upon crossing into Israel, the first thing he did was hug a psychologist who greeted him, desperate for human contact. She also called on the international community to push efforts for the release of all hostages. 'As we celebrated, two other hostages sat terrified in the same vehicle, forced into Hamas' grotesque spectacle. The Red Cross and world leaders must do the minimum — ensure their safety.' Sigi Cohen, mother of Eliya Cohen, stressed the daily struggle to raise awareness for the hostages. 'For 505 days, we fought to bring Eliya home. He found strength in his faith, reciting prayers and making kiddush over a cup of water,' she said. 'We must stay united, keep fighting and bring everyone home.' The families expressed gratitude to Israeli officials, IDF soldiers and activists who supported their struggle. 'We’ve completed our personal mission,' Shem Tov said. 'But the national mission is far from over. Every hostage must come home.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkzsckyqke	2025-02-23T12:33:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/23/Hk11UrwkK9Jg/Hk11UrwkK9Jg_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg
IDF to remain in parts of Syria and Lebanon indefinitely, Netanya...	Prime minister says IDF will remain in key positions in Syria and Lebanon to protect Israeli communities and thwart any threat, emphasizing Israel’s demand for the full demilitarization of southern Syria from forces of the new regime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that IDF troops would remain stationed in key areas of Syria and Lebanon, emphasizing that Israel demands the full demilitarization of southern Syria and will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in the region. Speaking at a ceremony for graduates of the IDF’s combat officer course, Netanyahu stated: 'In Syria, IDF forces will remain in the Mount Hermon area and the buffer zone for an indefinite period to protect our communities and counter any threats. We will not allow forces from HTS (Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, led by Syria’s new ruler Abu Mohammad al-Julani) or the New Syrian Army to enter areas south of Damascus.' Regarding Lebanon, Netanyahu declared that Israeli forces would maintain control over strategic areas along the northern border inside Lebanese territory until the Lebanese government and military fully uphold their commitments under the cease-fire agreement. Defense Minister Israel Katz reinforced Netanyahu’s message, stating: 'Our eyes are on the entire region today, especially Syria. We are committed to ensuring that October 7 never happens again. As the prime minister said, there is a new reality in southern Syria. The IDF will not allow hostile forces to establish a presence in the security zone from here to Damascus, and we will act against any threat.' Katz also highlighted Israel’s commitment to strengthening ties with friendly populations in the region, particularly the Druze, whom he called 'brothers in arms.' He reassured that Israel is dedicated to ensuring their safety and preserving their historical connections. IDF deployments in Syria and Lebanon The IDF entered the Syrian buffer zone immediately after the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime. At the time, the military cited concerns about armed groups moving into the area and deployed forces to key positions to protect Israeli communities in the Golan Heights. The IDF stressed that it does not interfere in Syrian affairs but will continue operating as necessary to secure the buffer zone and safeguard Israel. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: After the Syrian rebels took control of the Golan and toppled Assad, the IDF warned them not to cross the Alpha Line, marking the start of the demilitarized zone. The Northern Command raised its alert level and activated emergency defense plans in anticipation of a potential invasion from the east. In Lebanon, nearly six months after the start of what has effectively become the Third Lebanon War, Israel is reinstating a partial military presence inside Lebanese territory for the first time in 25 years. Under this new deployment, five outposts will be established just a few hundred meters beyond the border fence, each manned by hundreds of soldiers. The IDF plans to maintain this presence until a new political directive is issued. The outposts, located outside Shiite villages near the border, will provide Israel with strategic control over previously vulnerable terrain. They include: A ridge overlooking the town of Shlomi to monitor infiltration routes from Wadi Qatia and observe Lebanese positions to the north and west. Jabal Balat, formerly known as Karakum outpost, to protect Shetula and Zar’it while overseeing the village of Zibqin. A position on Shaked Ridge, overlooking Avivim and Malkia, to monitor the Saluki River valley and the towns of Aitaroun, Bint Jbeil and Maroun al-Ras. An outpost on Tzivoni Ridge above Kibbutz Margaliot in the Upper Galilee. The northeastern-most outpost on Hamamis Ridge near the French Fort, securing the Ayoun Valley and Metula while overseeing the towns of Khiam and Kila. A similar forward defense strategy is being implemented along the Gaza border, with ongoing coordination between the Southern and Northern Commands to apply lessons from recent operations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1vqfey5yg	2025-02-23T12:12:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/23/Hy11Tvn00cke/Hy11Tvn00cke_0_0_570_320_0_small.jpg

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on Sunday evening spoke with released hostages Sagui Dekel-Chen and Ohad Ben-Ami, and their wives, according to a statement from his office. He asked about their well-being and inquired about the returnees' readjustment and rehabilitation process. He said that all citizens of Israel were pleased at their return and emphasized their victory in body and spirit during their time in captivity. Netanyahu said that it had been necessary to apply great pressure on the 'Hamas monsters' for the release to occur, given that Hamas had demanded to release only a reduced number of living hostages under the current agreement; however, the Prime Minister insisted on maximizing the number of living hostages returning in the first stage of the deal. He promised that he would continue to work for the return of all of our hostages, the living and the deceased.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryjjpwyqkx	2025-02-23T12:07:26-08:00	
Syria's new president invited to emergency Arab League summit in ...	Syria's new President Ahmed al-Sharaa has received an invitation from Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to attend an emergency Arab League summit in Cairo on March 4, the Syrian presidency said in a statement on Sunday, marking a major step in rebuilding ties with the Arab world after the downfall of Bashar Assad. Sharaa, whose Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group spearheaded the offensive that toppled autocratic leader Assad in December, was declared president for a transitional phase last month. Since assuming power, Sharaa has sought to strengthen ties with Arab nations, pledging a political transition that includes the formation of an inclusive government and eventual elections, which he has said could take up to four years to organize. Egypt, which views Islamists as an existential threat, has treaded with caution after Sharaa took office, with officials saying Syria's new administration needed to adopt an inclusive political transition free from 'external interventions.' While Sisi congratulated Sharaa upon his appointment, their first face-to-face meeting is expected to take place during the Arab League summit. The upcoming Cairo summit is set to focus primarily on Arab efforts to counter U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to redevelop war-torn Gaza into an international beach resort and his calls for Egypt and Jordan to resettle displaced Gazans.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjtgtbk51x	2025-02-23T12:04:08-08:00

Six senior staffers resign from Sen. Fetterman’s office over his ...	The departures, including top communications officials, highlight growing internal dissatisfaction with the Pennsylvania Democrat’s evolving political stance and bipartisan outreach; Fetterman has emerged as one of the most outspoken pro-Israel voices among Senate Democrats. Six senior staffers have resigned from the office of Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., in recent months, citing frustration over his unwavering support for Israel following the Hamas Oct. 7 terror attack. The departures, which include top communications officials, have fueled speculation about internal dissatisfaction with the senator’s shifting political priorities. The latest exits include Communications Director Charlie Hills, who left Friday, and Legislative Director Tré Easton, whose departure date has not been confirmed. Three members of the communications team had already resigned, along with a previous communications director who stepped down last month. Sources familiar with the matter say the resignations stem from concerns that Fetterman’s focus on Israel has overshadowed the progressive platform on which he campaigned. A former staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the work environment as being 'almost entirely consumed by Israel-related matters.' Fetterman, who built his political brand as a progressive advocate for labor rights and economic justice, has faced increasing criticism from his base. His vocal support for Israel, combined with a willingness to collaborate with Republican lawmakers — including some aligned with President Donald Trump — has unsettled former allies. 'This is a guy who came in talking about being a champion for labor, and he’s gone pretty quiet on it,' said a former campaign staffer. 'Now, he’s essentially helping Republicans frame bipartisan efforts in their favor.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Fetterman has emerged as one of the most outspoken pro-Israel voices among Senate Democrats. He was among 12 Democrats who backed a GOP-led immigration bill and is the only Democratic senator to have privately met with Trump since his return to power. After the meeting, Trump praised Fetterman as 'a commonsense person.' Amid these shifts, Fetterman’s office has struggled to retain and recruit staff. The communications director role has seen multiple turnovers within a year, and sources indicate that hiring experienced Democratic staffers in Washington has become increasingly difficult. His transformation from a Bernie Sanders-endorsed progressive to a centrist with bipartisan leanings has left many early supporters disillusioned. 'He positioned himself as the only logical option to fight Trump’s influence in Pennsylvania, and now he’s actively working with him,' said a former aide. While Fetterman’s stance has drawn praise from conservatives, particularly for his position on Israel, it has also deepened rifts within the Democratic Party. His former chief of staff, Adam Jentleson, resigned amid these growing tensions, further underscoring the internal discord. Despite the criticism, Fetterman has remained a reliable Democratic vote on key issues, supporting President Joe Biden’s legislative agenda throughout his tenure. His office has not responded to requests for comment on the recent resignations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjajfgk9ke	2025-02-23T10:56:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/06/26/BypeM5FIC/BypeM5FIC_0_64_1280_720_0_small.jpg

82 bombs in seconds: IDF releases footage of Nasrallah's eliminat...	Military releases footage of the elimination of one of its most bitter enemies five months after his death - and during his funeral; Fighter jets fly above funeral site The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit on Sunday released footage of the September 27 elimination of former Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, coinciding with his funeral in Beirut. The footage shows a fighter jet dropping at least seven bombs in succession. The munition was part of the 82 bombs dropped on Hezbollah’s underground command center in Beirut, where Nasrallah and other senior officials were killed. A massive series of explosions is seen in the Dahieh district, lasting only a few seconds. The footage was released as Hezbollah attempted to turn Nasrallah’s funeral, attended by hundreds of thousands, into a show of strength after suffering heavy losses against Israel. The funeral had been delayed for five months due to the ongoing fighting and Hezbollah's wait for an Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon, which hasn't yet been completed since Israel still controls five strategic border points. To counter Hezbollah’s display, Israeli Air Force jets flew over the Beirut stadium where Nasrallah’s memorial service was held before a mass procession to his final burial site at a cemetery in Dahieh. At least four Israeli fighter jets flew over the stadium, where crowds chanted: 'At your command, Nasrallah! Death to America! Death to Israel!' The jets also flew low while Hezbollah’s new secretary-general, Naim Qassem, delivered a speech via video; he did not attend the memorial in person. The coffin of Nasrallah’s designated successor Hashem Safieddine, who was killed days later and is set to be buried Monday, was also displayed at the event. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: A military official told Ynet that some of the jets in the Beirut flyover had also participated in Nasrallah’s elimination. 'The flyover is a clear message — we are above, watching and will strike anywhere at any time,' he said. Reports also surfaced of multiple Israeli strikes in Lebanon throughout Sunday. 'Israeli fighter jets flying over Nasrallah’s funeral in Beirut send a clear message: those who threaten to destroy Israel and attack Israel will meet this fate. You will mourn at funerals — we will celebrate victories,' Defense Minister Israel Katz said. Nasrallah was eliminated in late September 2024 in an airstrike that ended his 32-year reign over Hezbollah, transforming the terror group into a full-fledged army. The elimination of Nasrallah, Safieddine and nearly the entire Hezbollah command, combined with heavy Israeli bombardments and ground operations, severely weakened Hezbollah’s standing in Lebanon and the Iranian axis, where Nasrallah was a key figure. The IDF official stressed: 'One of the greatest achievements of the war — enabling all other IDF successes in the north — is the air superiority we worked extremely hard to establish. This was a force multiplier for ground operations. We now have air dominance over Lebanon and Syria.' He described three categories of Israeli strikes in Lebanon: targeting arms deliveries along the Syrian border, responding to Hezbollah violations ignored by international cease-fire monitors and eliminating operatives in southern Lebanon. 'It’s clear they’re trying to recover in some way,' he noted. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hklsraucyg	2025-02-23T10:17:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/23/S1N2LnucJg/S1N2LnucJg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

And he pulled out the halva (sweet sesame treat)' he received on the way from Gaza to the base. Omer Shem Tov from Herzliya, freed after 505 days in captivity alongside Wenkert and Eliya Cohen, posted a family photo on Instagram, captioning it with Eminem’s 'Without Me' lyrics: 'Guess who's back.' He told relatives about the difficulty of losing his friend Itay Regev, who was released after 54 days together in captivity, his attempts to observe Shabbat in Gaza and his prolonged time alone in Hamas tunnels. Shem Tov, Wenkert and Cohen are hospitalized at Rabin Medical Center, along with Tal Shoham, who was freed separately. Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, held in Gaza for nearly a decade, were also released in the final phase of the first stage of hostage releases.

A Portuguese man was killed in the Saturday attack in the city of Mulhouse, near the border with Germany. Seven police officers were wounded, including a parking control agent hospitalized with grave injuries, the prosecutor’s office said.

US envoy Witkoff to visit Middle East this week in bid for deal's...	Trump’s envoy says US administration interested in seeing all hostages come out of Gaza while advancing talks; Israel aims to extend deal's first phase instead of ending war U.S. President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday he would visit the region this week, likely on Wednesday, and added, 'I expect Phase II to be implemented.' In an interview with CNN, he said, 'Netanyahu is motivated by the right reasons — Hamas cannot be part of any government in Gaza.' Witkoff added: 'We first need to extend Phase i. We hope to have enough time to start Phase II and finish it in order to release as many hostages as possible and advance the talks.' When asked whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to continue the deal or resume fighting in Gaza, he replied: 'I believe the prime minister wants to see hostages released — that’s certain. He also wants to protect Israeli citizens. He has a red line — Hamas cannot govern Gaza when this war ends. We’re trying to square the circle.' The hostage and cease-fire’s first phase is set to conclude this week, with four deceased hostages scheduled for release on Thursday. Of the 33 hostages included in this phase, Shlomo Mansour, Ohad Yahalomi, Tsachi Idan, and Itzik Elgart remain in captivity. If the first phase is not extended, it will end once the remains of these hostages are positively identified. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Families of hostages expected to be released this week expressed concern over the government’s decision to delay the release of Palestinian prisoners 'until the next hostages’ release is guaranteed and without humiliating ceremonies.' Despite the crisis, Israel is preparing for a possible extension of Phase I, which would prioritize four fathers alongside injured or ill hostages whose conditions were only recently confirmed through testimonies from released captives. A lengthy discussion on the terms is expected to take place before any extension takes place about how many Palestinian prisoners will be freed in exchange for the next hostages. This could allow for two or three additional releases, possibly coinciding with Ramadan, a period during which Hamas has no interest in resuming fighting. However, extending releases in stages contradicts the wishes of many families whose loved ones — both living and deceased — were excluded from Phase I. These families are demanding a single release for all. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r111t32ockx	2025-02-23T06:54:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/BySXiPzqJx/BySXiPzqJx_0_52_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Germans vote as far-right party set for best ever result	Vote dominated by worries about years-long stagnation of Europe’s biggest economy, pressure to curb migration and growing uncertainty over future of Ukraine and Europe’s alliance with U.S. Germans began casting their votes in a national election on Sunday that is expected to restore power to Friedrich Merz's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), while the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party was forecast to achieve its best result yet in Europe's ailing economic powerhouse. Merz's CDU/CSU bloc has consistently led polls but was seen as unlikely to win a majority given Germany's fragmented political landscape, forcing it to sound out coalition partners. Those negotiations are expected to be tricky after a campaign that exposed sharp divisions over migration and how to deal with the AfD in a country where far-right politics carries a particularly strong stigma because of its Nazi past. That could leave unpopular Chancellor Olaf Scholz in a caretaker role for months, delaying urgently needed policies to revive Europe's largest economy after two consecutive years of contraction and as companies struggle against global rivals. Merz cast his vote in the western town of Arnsberg on Sunday morning. Asked how election day would go, he smiled and replied: 'It will go well.' Scholz voted in the eastern town of Potsdam. A caretaker government for months would create a leadership vacuum in the heart of Europe even as it deals with a host of challenges, including U.S. President Donald Trump's threats of a trade war and attempts to fast-track a ceasefire deal for Ukraine without European involvement. Germany, which has an export-oriented economy and has long relied on the U.S. for its security, is particularly vulnerable. Germans are more pessimistic about their living standards now than at any time since the financial crisis in 2008. The percentage who say their situation is improving dropped sharply from 42% in 2023 to 27% last year, according to pollster Gallup. Attitudes towards migration have also hardened in a profound shift in German public sentiment since its 'Refugees Welcome' culture during Europe's 2015 migrant crisis. Polls opened at 8 am local time and will close at 6 pm when vote counting will start and exit polls will be released. Merz 'knows something about the economy,' said voter Brigitte Klute after braving the cold to cast her vote in Arnsberg, Merz's hometown. 'He needs to rebuild our country a little better. So much has been lost,' she said. Musk weighs in Sunday's election follows the collapse last November of Scholz's coalition of his centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), the Greens and pro-market Free Democrats (FDP) in a row over budget spending. The SPD is heading for its worst result since World War Two. The election campaign has been dominated by fierce exchanges over the perception that irregular immigration is out of control, fuelled by a series of attacks in which the suspected perpetrators were of migrant origin. A Syrian refugee was arrested over the stabbing of a tourist at Berlin's Holocaust memorial on Friday. Prosecutors said he had been planning 'to kill Jews'. Earlier this month, an Afghan migrant plowed into a crowd in Munich, hurting dozens, hours before leaders including U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in the southern city for the Munich Security Conference. The campaign has also been overshadowed by the unusually forceful show of solidarity by members of the Trump administration - including Vice President JD Vance and tech billionaire Elon Musk - for the anti-migrant AfD and broadsides against European leaders. Just before the polls opened Musk again endorsed the AfD, posting a clip of regional AfD leader Bjoern Hoecke making a speech in which he said 'Germany is our country, our land, our nation... let's take our country back!' from the globalists. Hoecke has twice been fined for using a Nazi-era slogan and is deemed so radical a court said he could be described a fascist. The 12-year-old AfD is on track to take second place for the first time in a national election. 'I'm completely disappointed in politics, so maybe an alternative would be better,' said retired Berlin bookkeeper Ludmila Ballhorn. The 76-year-old, who plans to vote AfD, said she was struggling to live on her state pension of 800 euros ($836.64) a month. 'Rents and all other costs have soared,' she added. The AfD, however, is unlikely to govern for now because all mainstream parties have ruled out working with the party, though some analysts believe it could pave the way for an AfD win in 2029. The strength of the AfD, along with a small but significant vote share for the far-left and the decline of Germany's big-tent parties, is increasingly complicating the formation of coalitions and governance. Coalition options EU allies are cautiously hopeful the elections might deliver a more coherent government able to drive forward policy at home and in the bloc. Some also hope Merz will reform the 'debt brake' constitutional mechanism that limits government borrowing and that critics say has strangled new investment. The most likely outcome of the election, say analysts, is a tie-up of Merz's conservative bloc of Christian Democrats (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU) with the SPD, which is polling in third place in another uneasy 'grand coalition'. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Polls, however, suggest another three-way coalition may be necessary if several small parties make the 5% threshold to enter parliament, complicating talks. 'A lot of my friends are likely going to vote for the conservatives because this government didn't work so well and Merz's international standing is quite good,' said 26-year-old civil servant Mike Zeller. 'I just hope enough parties agree to a government so they can leave the AfD out.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkxv0y009je	2025-02-23T04:28:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/23/HkTJ3wO91x/HkTJ3wO91x_0_182_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Israel seeks extradition of 'Lev Tahor' cult leader from El Salva...	Elazar Rompler, arrested following Interpol red notice, wanted by authorities after he was indicted of severe physical and psychological abuse of minors and fled the country Israel's State Prosecutor’s International Department submitted an extradition request on Sunday to authorities in El Salvador for Elazar Rompler, one of the leaders of the extremist Haredi cult 'Lev Tahor,' who was arrested last month in Central America. According to the Justice Ministry, the request is based on a 2020 indictment against Rompler, accusing him of severe physical and psychological abuse of two minors between 2009 and 2011, as well as aggravated assault, in connection with his role in the sect. Due to the serious charges, a hearing was scheduled at the Jerusalem District Court in December 2020. However, Rompler fled to Guatemala using a forged passport. The indictment describes Rompler, a former school principal within the 'Lev Tahor' community, as having committed serious abuse against minors while the sect was based in Canada. His attorney notified prosecutors in 2020 that Rompler had fled the country to Guatemala, despite a travel ban imposed on him. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to the indictment, Rompler severely beat two students at the school he ran in Canada. In one case, he suspected a student of stealing money from charity funds. As punishment, the child was tied to a table to prevent movement. Rompler and another teacher allegedly beat him for hours using a belt and a stick, while the child cried, screamed for help, and begged them to stop. As a result, the child was unable to stand and had to be carried home. In another incident, Rompler suspected a student of lying. He and other teachers gathered the schoolchildren and announced that one of them had lied and needed to confess. When no one spoke up, the student was tied to a table and whipped for about an hour as Rompler and other staff members looked on.

Israeli jets fly over Beirut during Nasrallah funeral as hundreds...	Hundreds of thousands reported in and around sports stadium chanting 'Death to America, death to Israel'; current Hezbollah chief stays away, sends video message vowing to continue Nasrallah's path ' Hundreds of thousands gathered in and around the Camille Chamoun sport arena in Beirut for the funeral of slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and his successor Hashem Safieddine who were both killed by the IDF five months ago during the war. The crowd chanted 'Death to America, and death to Israel' as the coffins of the two leaders were brought into the stadium while scriptures from the Quran were read and the Hezbollah anthem was played over the loud speakers and projected on large screens to the crowds outside. A message from Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei was delivered by a Muslim cleric, vowing that the 'conflict against the arrogance' will not end. At the same time four Israeli Air Force fighter jets flew above the city as Hezbollah attempted to demonstrate its greatest show of force since the cease-fire came into effect last November. The IDF confirmed that it had conducted strikes against Hezbollah targets in South Lebanon and in the Beqaa Valley in the east after violations by the Iran-backed terror group, of the cease-fire agreement. 'The IDF struck military sites containing rocket launchers and weapons where Hezbollah activity was identified in the area of Baalbek and several additional areas in southern Lebanon,' the military said in a statement. These activities of the Hezbollah terrorist organization are in violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon and constitute a threat to the State of Israel and its civilians.' Defense Minister Israel Katz confirmed the flyover was an Israeli show of force. 'Israeli Air Force planes in the sky over Beirut while the funeral of Hassan Nasrallah was underway deliver a clear message: anyone who threatens Israel with destruction of attacks Israel will meet this end,' he said. 'You practice funerals and we practice victories.' Hezbollah's current leader Naim Qassem did not attend the funeral himself, likely out of security cocerns, but spoke in a video address to the crowd vowing to continue Nasrallah's policy and path . He said the Lebanese government was responsible to oppose Israeli violations of the cease-fire. 'We agreed to a truce because we are not interested in fighting a war without a political or territorial end. We complied with the terms, but Israel has not.'

Hamas tried to hide my son's real condition, not honor our famil...	Shaaban al-Sayed says Hisham was subjected to emotional terror, isolation and humiliation leaving him broken and uncommunicative The father of Hisham al-Sayed who was released on Saturday after dealy a decade in Hamas captivity said the decision by Hamas to free his son without holding the same kid of public 'ceremony' held for all other Israeli hostages upon their release was to hid the dire condition he was in. Hamas claimed it had opted not to release al-Sayed with a public display, out of respect for his Palestinian roots and in honor of his family who are members of the Muslim Bedouin sector in Israeli society. Shaaban al-Sayed said in an interview with Ynet that he struggled to cope with the state his son was in. 'He is broken, and his condition is severe,' he said. 'He is not in good shape. He barely speaks, and when he does, it’s in a whisper, with his head lowered.' The father said Hisham who has struggled with mental illness, may have been held in isolation. 'He was in a torture camp. They didn’t want people to see the state he is in, which is why there was no ceremony. Hamas are liars. If they truly respected people, they would have released him long ago. As a Muslim, I am furious at Hamas.' Al-Sayed was released in Gaza City and handed over to the Red Cross at a location separate from the other hostages who were freed hours earlier. 'His condition is very bad,' the father said. 'For those who know the movie Tarzan, where he lives with animals—it’s something like that. The problem is, he can’t express what he wants or where he was. We can’t communicate with him. I prayed he would return like he used to be. He was a normal person, communicative, but he had schizophrenia,' he said. 'His life has been destroyed. The doctors are shocked but don’t want to say much. They are trying to assess and define his current state. He was in limbo—it’s hard for me to describe it. He has a bruise here and there, and we’re trying to figure out what it is, but he is deeply humiliated. He has no personality left. He is ruined. They abused him, especially mentally. Not with beatings or lashes, but mentally he is broken. He’s not a person anymore. When we saw him walking on his feet, it encouraged us. But during our first meeting with him, after the initial hug, I realized he wasn’t responding, and that was when I broke. It was the first time in years that I cried.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Doctors at Sourasky Medical Center in Tel Aviv, where Hisham was taken said it was a privilage and obligation to care for Hisham and Vera Mengistu, who were both held hostage for an extensive time. 'The circumstances of their prolonged captivity and their return after so many years create significant complexities,' they said adding they were facing challenges unlike any they had encountered. Professor Gil Fire, hospital's deputy director, explained: 'According to initial examinations, both Hisham and Avera arrived in generally stable physical condition, which allowed them to meet their families after a prolonged wait. We will continue to assess their condition in the coming days and beyond, as their situation reflects not just physical challenges but also profound mental and emotional ones.' Hisham and Avera were released on Saturday alongside Eli Cohen, Omer Wenkert, and Omer Shemtov, who were kidnapped 505 days ago from the Nova festival. Tal Shoham, who was abducted from his home in Kibbutz Be’eri, was also released on Saturday from Hamas captivity. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sknlrloqkx	2025-02-23T00:53:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/22/SJ4Px9v9Jx/SJ4Px9v9Jx_0_0_1280_853_0_small.jpg
Buenos Aires proposes bill to renaming 'Palestine Street' to 'Bib...	Yamil Santoro, a member of the Argentine capital's city council, introduced the proposal to reomve the name of the street in the city's Almagro neighborhood to honor the family brutally murdered Following the return of the remains of Shiri Bibas and her children Ariel and Kfir, a deputy mayor of Buenos Aires proposed naming a city street after them. Yamil Santoro, a member of the Argentine capital's city council, introduced the proposal, calling for the street 'Estado de Palestina' (State of Palestine) in the Almagro neighborhood to be renamed 'Bibas Family Street.' Shiri Bibas, her husband, Yarden, and their children, 4-year-old Ariel and 9-month-old Kfir, were kidnapped to the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, 2023. Shiri and the children were taken separately from Yarden and were murdered shortly afterward. Yarden was released on Feb. 1 as part of the second hostage deal. 'The confirmation of the murder of the two children and their mother is a deep pain for everyone. Hamas is death,' Santoro said, A key obstacle to Santoro’s proposal is Law No. 83, which was approved in October 1998 and states that 'under no circumstances may streets or public places be named after individuals before 10 years have passed since their death.' but the city council member was working to amend the law for what he calls the 'unique case' of the Bibas family. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He told local media that he has not yet attempted to contact the Bibas family out of respect for their loss. 'We will wait until a reasonable amount of time has passed before approaching them,' he said. Santoro said he found it hard to believe the legislature would oppose the gesture but noted he was not counting on politicians from the left, who he claimed 'tend to adopt antisemitic positions.' However, he said he was open to working with others to find a compromise. At the same time, Santoro distinguished between Hamas and Gaza’s residents. 'The Palestinian people, as a population, deserve fair living conditions, peace, and stability to develop and thrive,' he said. He also asked citizens in a post on X (formerly Twitter) to suggest other initiatives that the Buenos Aires legislature could pursue to honor the victims and combat terrorism. On Thursday, following the return of the bodies of Kfir and Ariel—who held both Israeli and Argentine citizenship—Argentine President Javier Milei declared two days of national mourning in their memory. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjkpfdd9kl	2025-02-23T00:39:57-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/06/Hkf6tPJPw0/Hkf6tPJPw0_0_76_768_433_0_small.jpg

IDF tanks near Jenin as Israel expands West Bank anti-terror oper...	Arab media reports Israel imposes 48-hour curfewon the town of Qabatiya, south of Jenin as the military operation spreads to futher villages; IDF says a number of tanks positioned for defensive purposes only For the first time since the Second Intifada, Israeli tanks were sighted in the West Bank on Sunday morning near the village of Muqeibila, close to Jenin. The presence of armored vehicles comes as the IDF announced a ramping up of anti-terror operations following last week's attempted coordinated bus bombings in central Israel. TheIDF said that it deployed only 3 tanks to the area which it emphasized would only serve for defensive measures and not take part in offensive operations. Palestinian sources told Al Jazeera that Israeli forces have imposed a 48-hour curfew in the town of Qabatiya, south of Jenin, as part of the widening military operation. According to the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit, forces will operate in additional villages under the Menashe Brigade’s jurisdiction. 'The IDF, Shin Bet, and Border Police continue counterterrorism operations in northern Samaria and are expanding offensive activity in the area. A tank unit will operate in Jenin as part of the offensive efforts. Forces continue their operations in both the Jenin and Tulkarem regions,' the statement read. The forces deployed include three reinforcement battalions sent following the bus bombings in central Israel on Thursday night. The armored force spotted near Jenin consisted of a small deployment of three to four tanks from the 188th Armored Brigade. The operation focuses primarily on Jenin and the Nur Shams refugee camp in Tulkarem. The tanks are expected to be deployed inside Jenin in the coming days as part of efforts to clear the area of explosive devices. So far, the IDF has demolished dozens of homes belonging to militants in the heart of the refugee camp, which has become a stronghold for armed groups in recent years. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The deployment of tanks in the West Bank is highly unusual. Until now, the IDF has relied on D9 armored bulldozers and reinforced vehicles for operations in northern Samaria. The use of tanks signals a strategic shift, with the military aiming to exert additional pressure on militant groups in the area. Since the beginning of Operation 'Iron Wall,' the IDF said that more than 200 wanted suspects were arrested and at least 71 terrorists killed. According to military sources, 217 firearms have been seized, and over 100 explosive-making facilities have been destroyed. Security forces have also tightened control over key roads in the region, setting up additional checkpoints to increase pressure on terror organizations. Investigation into bus bombings continues Meanwhile, security officials were continuing to investigate Thursday's bus bombings, which were carried out using improvised explosive devices similar to those frequently encountered by the IDF in the northern West Bank. Authorities were working to identify the network responsible and prevent future attacks. The IDF was also facing growing concerns over possible 'game-changing' weapons smuggling along the Jordanian border with the West Bank. The military views the deployment of tanks in the northern West Bank as a clear message to terror groups that Israel was determined to neutralize them. Defense officials also believe that some of the convicted Paletinian terrorists who were released to the West Bank as part of Israel’s cease-fire and hostage release deal with Hamas may return to terrorist activities. Security forces were closely monitoring these individuals in an effort to prevent the rebuilding of Hamas infrastructure, particularly ahead of the upcoming Mulim holy month of Ramadan that begns next month. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjai3u00qye	2025-02-23T00:08:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/23/Sk6Q8L00cJg/Sk6Q8L00cJg_0_265_1046_562_0_small.jpg
Released hostage says IDF bombings terrified her untill she grew ...	Agam Berger, released after 482 days of Hamas captivity says she was moved around often, stayed with Palestinian families along with Liri Albag and attempted to keep Jewish traditions Agam Berger, an IDF lookout who was released after 482 days of captivity in Gaza said she was terrified by the IDF bombings of Gaza untill she grew used to them. ''Some of it was terrifying, especially at first, because you’re not used to it. You feel the house shaking. I live in the center of the country—these are not things I’m familiar with. But over time, the fear subsided a bit.' She said she had been moved around nearly every month by her captors hoping to keep her location secret. Berger recounted her experiences in a meeting with Rabbi Yoshiyahu Pinto. She told him she and Liri Albag were held together often in the homes of Palestinian families. She said the two would sometimes listen to the radio and sing, but they were silenced when doing so. 'They would tell you to be quiet because the neighbors could hear Hebrew from outside,' she said and explained that the neighbors were unaware of their presence and the Hamas guards were worried that they might hear Hebrew spoken. Berger said she only found out two days before, that she was abut to be released. She and Albag had attempted to keept track of days and dates on their own, but they didn’t always have access to a calendar. Berger also spoke with the rabbi about her connection to Judaism and her efforts to observe Jewish holidays during her captivity. She had argued with one of her captors because she refused to read from the Quran they provided her. Later, she said, she received two Jewish prayer books. 'Soldiers left two prayer books somewhere,' she explained. 'The mayor of Gaza received items from his ‘soldiers,’ and they found two prayer books, a newspaper, and a book by a rabbi—I forgot the name—and they gave them to us. They didn’t know what it was. They saw it was in Hebrew and had an IDF stamp.' But the girls were not allowed to take the books with them when they were released. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Berger told Pinto she did everything she could to observe Passover. 'There were no matzot, but for me, it was clear that I would try to observe as much as I could,' she said. 'I asked them for cornmeal and dates—whatever was available—because it was a time when there were no vegetables or many other things.' She also ate rice and even used separate utensils and disposable cutlery. 'Liri and I drew a Haggadah, as we remembered it. It created a holiday atmosphere. Liri made decorations and table arrangements,' she emphasized. On Tisha B’Av the girls fasted. 'We saw on television when they read the Hebrew and Gregorian dates in the news, and then we counted. I don’t remember exactly which date it was in the month of Av, but we kept track,' she said. On Yom Kippur, Berger said she asked the captors to tell her when the fast would take place. 'We told them, 'We have holidays now, please try to check for us,' and somehow they managed to find out,' she said. 'I hope it was the accurate date—I honestly don’t know if it was correct or not, but that’s what they told us.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjm5tru51x	2025-02-22T23:39:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/SkhcMh00dJe/SkhcMh00dJe_0_0_1280_599_0_small.jpg

'These ceremonies contain no insult to the prisoners but rather reflect the humane and generous treatment they receive,' Hamas said in a statement, accusing Israel of mistreating Palestinian prisoners during their release. 'The real humiliation is what our prisoners endure—from torture, beatings, and deliberate mistreatment to their final moments in detention. They are released with their hands bound and eyes covered, while their families are threatened not to celebrate their return.'

Hamas says Israel's delay of prisoner release ploy to derail talk...	Hamas defends decision to force two hostages to watch Saturday's release 'ceremony,' calling it a message that 'military options have failed' and that negotiations are only way to secure further releases The Hamas terror group on Sunday said Israel's failure to release 620 Palestinian prisoners as part of the cease-fire agreement was a violation of the deal. 'Netanyahu's decision is a deliberate attempt to derail the agreement, is a clear violation of its terms and is evidence of the occupation's lack of credibility in living up to its committments,' the terror group said in a statement. 'We call on the mediators and the international community to pressure the occupation to comply with the cease-fire deal and release the prisoners without delay. A senior Hamas official said earlier that the group is in contact with mediators and sees 'positive signs' for a potential prisoner release, even as Israel delayed the scheduled release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, citing terror groups’ repeated violations of a cease-fire agreement. Hamas spokesman Abd al-Latif al-Qanou told Qatar’s Al-Araby channel that the group was ready to negotiate the next phase of a deal and would release all Israeli hostages if Israel agreed to a full military withdrawal from Gaza, a complete cease-fire, and the reconstruction of the enclave. In a separate interview with Al Jazeera, al-Qanou defended Hamas’ decision to force two Israeli hostages—Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evyatar David—to watch the release of Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, and Eliyah Cohen on Saturday. He called it a message that 'military options have failed' and that negotiations are the only way to secure the hostages’ return. Israeli officials condemned the move as psychological abuse. 'These ceremonies contain no insult to the prisoners but rather reflect the humane and generous treatment they receive,' Hamas said in a statement, accusing Israel of mistreating Palestinian prisoners during their release. 'The real humiliation is what our prisoners endure—from torture, beatings, and deliberate mistreatment to their final moments in detention. They are released with their hands bound and eyes covered, while their families are threatened not to celebrate their return.' Early Sunday, the Prime Minister's Office announced that the release of 620 Palestinian prisoners had been postponed 'until the next group of hostages is secured and without disgraceful ceremonies.' The decision followed a high-level security consultation led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday night, attended by senior security and political officials. Security officials had recommended proceeding with the prisoner release to facilitate the return of the remains of four Israeli hostages expected Thursday. However, after a break in discussions, political leaders decided to halt the release, accusing Hamas of breaching its commitments. Israeli officials said the group had disregarded assurances that hostage transfers would take place without public celebrations, instead staging elaborate ceremonies they described as grotesque. Later Saturday night, Hamas returned the body of Israeli hostage Shiri Bibas, after having falsely claimed on Thursday to have already handed over her remains. That day, the group had transferred a coffin containing the body of a Palestinian woman instead. The return of Bibas’ remains followed a similar incident in which Hamas handed over the bodies of Oded Lifshitz and brothers Kfir and Ariel Bibas. Before transferring the remains to Israel, Palestinian terror groups held a public ceremony that included processions and symbolic displays. Israeli officials condemned the event as a deliberate provocation, calling it an attempt to humiliate Israel and exploit the hostages’ deaths for propaganda purposes. Shiri Bibas and her two sons were taken hostage during Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack and later murdered in captivity by Al-Mujahedeen ('Lords of the Wilderness'), a Salafi extremist group separate from Hamas. Her husband, Yarden Bibas, who was also kidnapped, was released as part of the first phase of the current hostage deal. The fate of the remaining hostages and the future of the prisoner exchange remain uncertain as negotiations continue.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjjnmhdcye	2025-02-22T22:32:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/22/H1WgmVP5yx/H1WgmVP5yx_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Holy See says 88-year-old pontiff not out of danger after he was diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs, requiring 'high-flow oxygen' The Vatican said on Saturday that Pope Francis' health had deteriorated over the past 24 hours and for the first time described his condition as 'critical', reporting he had needed supplemental oxygen and blood transfusions. The pope was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on February 14 after experiencing difficulty breathing for several days, and was subsequently diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. In a statement on Saturday evening, the Vatican said the 88-year-old Francis had suffered a 'prolonged asthma-like respiratory crisis' during the morning that had required the administration of 'high-flow oxygen'. 'The Holy Father's condition remains critical,' the statement said. 'The Pope is not out of danger.' It added: 'The Holy Father remains alert and has spent the day in a chair, though he is suffering more than yesterday. At the moment, the prognosis remains guarded.' Besides the additional oxygen, the Vatican said he had also needed blood transfusions because tests showed he had a low platelet count, which is associated with anaemia. A U.S.-based doctor said the Gemelli team was probably using the transfusions to raise the pope's levels of both red blood cells and platelets, which are small cell fragments in the blood that help form clots and stop or prevent bleeding. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Dr. Andrea Vicini, a Jesuit priest and professor at Boston College, stressed he only knew of the pope's case through the Vatican's public statements. 'It seems it is under control, but his body is showing signs of difficulty to overcome (the) situation,' he said. The Vatican announced earlier on Saturday that the pope would not appear in public on Sunday to lead prayer with pilgrims, the second consecutive week he will have missed the event. It is believed to be the first time he has missed two consecutive Angelus prayers for health reasons. After undergoing intestinal surgery in 2021, he led the Angelus just one week later, and skipped one public Sunday prayer in 2023 following another operation. Double pneumonia is a serious infection that can inflame and scar both lungs, making it difficult to breathe. The Vatican has described the pope's infection as 'complex,' saying it is being caused by two or more micro-organisms. In a briefing on Friday, two of his doctors said the pope was highly vulnerable due to his age and frailty. Dr. Sergio Alfieri, a senior member of the Gemelli staff, said there was a risk the lung infection could spread to his bloodstream and develop into sepsis, which 'could be very difficult to overcome'. Francis, who has been pope since 2013, has suffered bouts of ill health in the past two years. He is particularly prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed. In 2013, Pope Francis succeeded Benedict XVI, who resigned due to health reasons. He was regarded as a humble pope and a soccer enthusiast and was initially seen as a liberal. He frequently spoke in support of migrants, environmental causes, and the LGBTQ community. Later, he took a stricter stance on abortion. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/symdpnd9je	2025-02-22T21:42:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/rJUUs2g5Jl/rJUUs2g5Jl_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Sudanese rebels to form parallel government	RSF, allies not expected to receive widespread recognition, but is further sign of country's splintering during a civil war that has lasted almost two years Sudan's Rapid Support Forces signed a charter with allied political and armed groups late on Saturday to establish a 'government of peace and unity', signatories al-Hadi Idris and Ibrahim al-Mirghani told Reuters. Among the signatories to the charter is Abdelaziz al-Hilu, a powerful rebel leader who controls vast swathes of territory and troops in South Kordofan state, and who has long demanded that Sudan embrace secularism. Such a government, which has already drawn concern from the United Nations, is not expected to receive widespread recognition, but is a further sign of the splintering of the country during a civil war that has lasted almost two years. The RSF has seized most of the western Darfur region and parts of the Kordofan region in the war, but is being pushed back from central Sudan by the Sudanese army, which has condemned the formation of a parallel government. Idris, a former official and head of an armed group, said the government's formation will be announced from inside the country in the coming days. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to the text of the charter, the signatories agreed that Sudan should be a 'secular, democratic, non-centralised state' with a single national army, though it preserved the right of armed groups to continue to exist. The charter said the government did not exist to split the country, but rather to unify it and to end the war, tasks it said the army-aligned government operating out of Port Sudan had failed to do. General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, head of the paramilitary RSF, which has been accused of widespread abuses including genocide, was hit with sanctions by the U.S. earlier this year. Dagalo had previously shared power with the army and civilian politicians as part of an agreement following the ouster of Omar al-Bashir in 2019. The two forces ousted the civilian politicians in a 2021 coup before war erupted between them over the integration of their troops during a transition to democracy. The conflict has devastated the country, creating an 'unprecedented' humanitarian crisis and driving half the population into hunger, with famine in multiple areas. The signing took place in a closed event, in contrast to a flashier kick-off earlier this week in Nairobi. Both events were hosted in Kenya, drawing condemnation from Sudan and domestic criticism of Kenyan President William Ruto for plunging the country into a diplomatic melee. The Sudanese government has accused the United Arab Emirates of backing the RSF militarily and financially, charges U.N. experts and U.S. lawmakers say are credible. The UAE denies the accusation. Earlier this week, Sudan passed changes to the country's constitutional document, giving the army expanded powers. General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan says the army would be announcing its 'war cabinet' soon. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1pblbo51l	2025-02-22T21:38:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/04/17/H12a5R5f3/H12a5R5f3_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Beirut prepares for the funeral of slain Hezbollah chief	Ceremony begins at Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium with mass crowds expected inside and outside, organizers say delegations from 60 or 70 countries are expected The funeral of slain Hezbollah chiefs Hassan Nasrallah and Hashem Safieddine will be held on Sunday in Beirut with a central ceremony scheduled for 1 pm at the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium on the outskirts of the Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs. Nasrallah will then be buried at a dedicated site nearby, according to reports along with a bottle containing 'Palestinian and al Aqsa land.' Crowds gathered overnight in the city's Dahieh quarter a Hezbollah stronghold where both men were assassinated in targeted Israeli attacks. They called out 'death to Israel.' According to reports in Lebanon's Hezbollah-affiliated Al Manar television the Beirut international airport will suspend all flights between 12 pm and 4 pm in expectation of overcrowding. A Hezbollah source told the Qatari Al Araby al Jadeed newspaper that Iranians were having a hard time reaching Beirut for the funeral after Lebanese officials suspended certain flights from Iran recently. But there were other routs that could be used, the source said, including through Iraq. Before leaving for Beirut at the head of his country's delegation to the funeral, Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf said his visit may be a turning point in the relations between Tehran and the new Lebanese government. 'We will meet senior Lebanese officials,' he said. The meetings could be the turning point to improve our bilateral relations. Nasrallah's funeral is a reflection of the greatness of the Lebanese people.' The Iranian-backed terror group called for masses to attend the funeral. In a press conference on Saturday , deputy chief of Hezbollah's operational council Ali Damush assure everyone that the Lebanese army and security services were responsible for security. 'There are thousands of groups involved in the organization and discipline along side Hezbollah and the Amal organization.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Damush said Lebanon will not be Israeli. 'There will not be a foothold for the Zionists in Lebanon, and it will not be divided. Lebanon will remain a united nation with peace and dignity.' He said the funeral would be the day to renew loyalty. 'We tell our enemies and our friends that the resistance will remain on the ground. The enemy has not succeeded in destroying it and no one from the outside or within will succeed in crushing it. According to the Hezbollah organizers, visiting delegations from 60 to 70 countries will participate. There will be 80,000 to 85,000 people inside the sports stadium and an additional 100,000 outside. A huge banner was hung on the road leading to the Beirut Airport showing Nasrallah, Saffiedine and the slain commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds force who was assassinated in an American strike in 2020. The sign reads 'We are committed to the alliance.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjdnjsdqjg	2025-02-22T21:37:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/12/ryOoGw9F1e/ryOoGw9F1e_0_200_853_481_0_small.jpg

Trump to name FBI chief Patel as acting ATF director, source says	President Donald Trump will name newly confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel as the acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Saturday. Patel, a Trump loyalist, will run the FBI, the nation's most prominent law enforcement agency, at a time of growing upheaval while also leading the ATF, which enforces U.S. gun laws. Democrats and two moderate Republicans had forcefully opposed Patel's nomination, saying his past calls for retribution against Trump's critics made him unfit to lead the FBI, but this was not enough to overcome broad Republican support. Patel, who has received support from the Gun Owners of America lobby group for championing gun rights, would be expected to lead an overhaul of the agency, shifting its focus away from regulating firearms.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyxb2eucje	2025-02-22T21:11:56-08:00

Isarel says Palestinian prisoner release delayed over Hamas viola...	Prime Minister's office cites ceremonies demeaning hostages' dignity and the cynical use of the captives for propaganda purposes Israel announced that the release of 620 Palestinian prisoners under the cease-fire agreement was delayed over repeated Hamas violations of the deal including humiliating ceremonies demeaning hostages. The release that was to begin in the early evening hours was pushed back until a security consultation held by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was to take place. After waiting on vehicles for 13 hours, the prisoners were returned to their cells. 'In light of the repeated violations by Hamas — including the ceremonies that demean our hostages’ dignity and the cynical use of our hostages for propaganda purposes — it has been decided to delay the release of terrorists planned for yesterday until the next release of hostages is guaranteed, and without the humiliating ceremonies,' The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said in a statement released following an hours-long security consultation.

Boundless cruelty: Hamas forces hostages Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evy...	Terror group's video shows two hostages in Hamas vehicle as an audience in release 'ceremony' held in Gaza; couple addresses Netanyahu, saying 'we just want this to end' Hamas on Saturday continued to demonstrate its boundless cruelty as the terror group brought hostages Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evyatar David to the release point of three freed hostages — Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov and Eliya Cohen — forcing them to witness the cynical 'release ceremony.' In a video released by the terror group, the two can be seen addressing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from a Hamas vehicle, saying 'Our friends are getting out after 500 days and we just want this to end.' At the start of the video released by Hamas, Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa Dalal are seen sitting inside a Hamas vehicle, near the stage where three hostages stand moments before their release. 'Please, save us. Please, get us home,' Evyatar said. 'Please, I just want to go home. I'm begging, I'm begging.' Guy added, in what may have been dictated by his captors: 'Netanyahu, enough, you've destroyed us. Netanyahu, get us home, please.' The Hamas member filming them asked, 'How do you feel now?' Guy responded, 'I want to go home.' Evyatar added, 'Get us home, please, please.' Talking aobut to the three hostages standing on the stage, they said: 'Our friends are going home after 500 days with us. 500 days. We just want this, we're begging, please, this is all we want, all we want. Save us, please.' Evyatar continued: 'People of Israel, help us. Get us out. We want to be like them.' Guy added: 'We see our friends leaving after 500 days in captivity. Negotiations, that's the way — just sign a deal and end this. We just saw our friends go free after 500 days. We just want this to be over. We'll all die under military pressure.' Evyatar appealed to the government: 'Enough, it's time to end this. You started something — finish it. Please, military pressure isn't the solution. Please, citizens of Israel, don't stop protesting. It's so hard for us here.' Guy added: 'We just dream of the moment we'll be like them, that we can finally go home to our families and return to the lives we had before.' It's likely that parts of the video were dictated by their captors as part of Hamas' attempt at psychological warfare. Yaelah David, Evyatar’s sister commented on Hamas’ cynical sign of life from him, saying, 'They're alive. They were put in the most shocking and horrible situation possible. There's no limit to the cynicism of these monsters. I admire you, my brothers.' 'Beyond the inhumane physical conditions in captivity, as described by those who returned, the hostages are subjected to severe and brutal psychological abuse,' The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement. 'Time has run out. The government and its leader must accelerate negotiations and secure the immediate return of all hostages.'

The three freed hostages were released in another cruel 'ceremony' at the Nuseirat refugee camp, where they were brought on stage, and Omer Shem Tov was forced to kiss the heads of the terrorists who had held him.

Israel's dilemmas ahead of the hostage's deal possible second pha...	Netanyahu hold security assessment alongside security officials trying to ensure release of all Israeli hostages; while Hamas seeks deal's second phase, Israeli interests align with extended first phase Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is holding a security assessment on Saturday, with an Israeli official stating the goal is to return all hostages, both living and deceased. Meanwhile, Israel is delaying the release of Palestinian prisoners in response to Hamas' breach of the agreement by returning the body of an unrelated Palestinian woman instead of Shiri Bibas, who was murdered in captivity. A decision on how Israel will proceed will be made after the meeting. Participants include Mossad chief David Barnea, Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, Defense Minister Israel Katz, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, Shas party leader Aryeh Deri, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, and incoming Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir and other officials. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, leading negotiations for the second phase of the hostage deal, remains in the U.S. and is not attending. Israel is effectively threatening Hamas by withholding prisoner releases, putting Thursday's planned return of four deceased hostages at risk. The latest handover marks the end of the first stage of the hostage deal. The current standoff follows previous warnings that Hamas would 'pay the price' for returning the wrong body. U.S. President Donald Trump commented that Netanyahu is ' angry, and rightfully so ' and wants to resume fighting in Gaza. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: However, the delay is not expected to derail negotiations entirely, as Israel seeks to secure both the return of the four additional hostages and an extension of the first stage to release more living captives. Despite Hamas’ breach, the terror group quickly corrected the mistake, returning Bibas’ body within a day. Israeli officials believe the mix-up was likely an error rather than an intentional act. Meanwhile, Israel has completed the largest single-day hostage release of the deal, freeing six hostages alive. Negotiation sources say this, along with Hamas’ swift correction regarding Bibas, provides hope for continuing the deal. Hamas wants to proceed to the deal’s second phase under the existing agreement, rejecting additional Israeli demands such as disarmament, exile and dismantling its military wing. Israel believes that if a second-stage deal appears unattainable, Hamas may agree to extend the first phase in exchange for better terms, including changing Palestinian prisoner exchange ratios and increasing humanitarian aid, particularly caravans and construction equipment for Gaza. Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff is handling negotiations and met with Dermer in Miami on Thursday. To bridge gaps, Witkoff is expected to pressure both sides into concessions. Netanyahu, despite not admitting it publicly, is wary of the second phase, which includes a demand for Israel to complete its withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor by day 50 — a potential trigger for Smotrich to collapse his coalition. Netanyahu’s interest is to extend the first phase, securing more hostage releases while prolonging the cease-fire. Preparations for second-phase talks are underway, though details remain uncertain, including whether they will take place in Qatar or involve Witkoff shuttling between Doha, Cairo and Jerusalem. Israel will insist that mediators ensure the release of all hostages believed to be alive. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sklbijw5jl	2025-02-22T11:41:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/SyNNXzkYuJl/SyNNXzkYuJl_0_212_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Former hostage's father recounts his words on conditions in captivity, noting he lost a significant amount of weight and was held alone for over a year Freed hostage Omer Shem Tov’s family on Saturday spoke about their emotional reunion and the conditions in captivity he recounted to them. 'I feel amazing. I saw Omer — now everything’s fine,' his brother, Amit, told Ynet. 'He looks great, walking, talking, and telling us stories. He’s incredible.

Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ynet’s Arab affairs correspondent, Lior Ben Ari, reported that Omer’s forced kiss on a Hamas terrorist went viral on Arabic social media during the 'release ceremony,' appearing staged to look voluntary. Hamas claimed it was a 'spontaneous moment that demonstrates the high ethics of the Izz Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades’ treatment of prisoners,' but the demand for a head kiss, typically seen in a father-son relationship, was further evidence of Hamas’ well-orchestrated propaganda. Omer Wenkert’s mother Niva said her son also lost weight. He was held in a tunnel for his entire captivity, saw daylight only in the last few days and had no access to communication. He delivered a sign of life from hostages left behind and intends to join efforts to free those still in Gaza. The hostages’ release was documented from Hamas’ public spectacle in Gaza to their handover to IDF forces, reunions with family at the Re’im base and arrival at hospitals in central Israel. The releases marked the final phase of live hostage releases in the deal’s first phase which included 33 hostages in total. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkidikvc1x	2025-02-22T08:44:58-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/22/BJkIz00D9kx/BJkIz00D9kx_119_10_1075_606_0_small.jpg

AI is changing fast—here's how Israel is planning to stay on top	ILTV News Podcast with Ziv Katzir, head of the National Program for AI: 'We’re trying to maintain Israel’s leadership as an AI powerhouse' The world of artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a significant shift in recent years. It has moved from what was known as 'narrow AI'—an algorithm designed for a specific task—to the rise of generative AI. These new, sophisticated models can be easily adapted for various tasks, explained Ziv Katzir, head of the National Program for AI in Israel at the Israel Innovation Authority. Katzir explained that in this new generation, the 'borders' of AI are not well-defined. The science behind it is public. Once something is published—whether in an academic journal or by the private sector—it becomes much easier to replicate. This gives smaller countries like Israel an advantage. While Israel ranks among the top 10 in AI, it lacks the sheer numbers to develop countless models. Instead, it can take existing models and apply them in innovative ways (applied AI) to solve global challenges. Katzir, who transitioned to his role about three years ago after working in the private sector, described the National Program for AI as a cross-cutting initiative that involves nearly all government ministries and agencies. 'We’re trying to maintain Israel’s leadership as an AI powerhouse,' he told the ILTV News Podcast, emphasizing that Israel consistently ranks just below the United States and China—two global AI leaders. One key factor in Israel’s success is its deep talent pool and its ability to work across disciplines, a strength largely shaped by team structures in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). However, to maintain its edge, Israel must attract even more talent, improve data accessibility, and navigate the legal and ethical complexities of AI. 'We need to strengthen the way the Israeli government itself uses AI in favor of citizens,' Katzir said. 'We need to remove barriers in industry sectors that are more complicated: education, health care.' The Israel Innovation Authority invests around 2 billion shekels annually in the high-tech sector, with close to 40% allocated to AI-related companies. Israel is home to 9,000 high-tech companies, of which 2,300 to 2,400 have AI at their core. As the field evolves, the Authority is implementing proactive policies to expand Israel’s AI talent pool. It recently launched a program to attract foreign experts, returning Israelis, and Jewish professionals from abroad. It also encourages professionals from other nationalities to build their careers in Israel. Additionally, the Authority has introduced a digital program aimed at increasing the number of AI experts within the IDF by integrating advanced academic degrees into military service. 'So, combining advanced academic degrees within the military service,' Katzir explained. Watch there previous ILTV News Podcasts: William Daroff: If 40% of Gazans Want Out, Why Not Let Them Leave? Why the world can’t ignore Iran’s nuclear ambitions any longer MK Amit Halevi: Hostage deal will rehabilitate Nazi monster Hamas Another initiative focuses on retraining researchers in other fields, such as chemistry and biology, to become AI experts within their own domains. 'If you get a PhD in biology or chemistry, you're probably much more suitable to become an AI expert than if you get your bachelor’s degree in computer science,' Katzir said. As AI becomes more ingrained in daily life, most professionals will need retraining since their 'toolbox is changing.' However, that does not mean widespread unemployment. 'I don't think that machines are going to ever replace us,' Katzir said. The Importance of Data Katzir stressed that Israel’s biggest focus should be data. Managing data presents numerous challenges, including privacy, bias, and intellectual property rights (who owns the data?). He emphasized that the government must ensure the right data is available for research—but that is easier said than done. For now, he believes Israel has struck a delicate balance between protecting citizens from AI misuse and advancing data-driven innovation. 'Israel has struck a good balance between trying to protect citizens from the potential misuse of AI and the really strong desire to push forward this data, to make it work, to make it do useful things,' he said. AI’s Potential—and Its Risks What happens if AI is misused? The technology is already being deployed to automate and scale up cyberattacks. Some fear it could be used to design resilient bacteria or toxins. However, AI also holds enormous potential for good, as demonstrated by Israeli startups already leveraging it for positive change. 'Technology is always neutral,' Katzir noted. 'The choice is always ours as societies and individuals. I think we typically choose the right way.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjz5mepcje	2025-02-22T08:35:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/22/SJMzQVP5kx/SJMzQVP5kx_0_0_1024_577_0_small.jpg
Released hostage delivers sign of life from Guy Gilboa-Dalal, fam...	Relatives of hostage still held in Gaza says message was delivered anonymously after the release of Six captives on Saturday; 'it gives us hope,' father says Ilan, father of hostage Guy Gilboa-Dalal said on Saturday that he received the first sign of life from his son after eight months. The message came from one of the six released hostages who had been held with him for a long period. 'We were told he’s alive. It’s incredibly emotional and gives us hope,' Ilan said. 'We don’t know which released hostage delivered the message, only that Guy is alive and that alone is overwhelming,' he added. 'We’re waiting for more details about his condition and where he’s being held. 'We have so many questions — does he know that his brother Gal, who was also at the party (Nova music festival), survived? Does he know that his close friends were murdered? We’re waiting for updates from intelligence sources and, of course, for the second phase of the deal to bring Guy and all the hostages home.' Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen and Tal Shoham were freed after 505 days in captivity on Saturday, alongside Hisham al-Sayed and Avera Mengistu. One of them delivered the sign of life from Guy, bringing relief to his parents after months of uncertainty. Guy, 22, attended the Nova music festival with his friends Evyatar David, Idan Haramaty and Ron Zarfati. His brother Gal later joined them. When the attack began, Guy insisted on staying with his friends and the brothers split up. Gal escaped, Ron and Idan were murdered and Evyatar and Guy were abducted.

'When Almog returned, he described everything they went through,' Ilan said. 'Almog, Evyatar, and Guy hid behind a bush near Route 232. They saw horrific sights — people being murdered before their eyes. When a terrorist found them, he chose to kidnap them rather than kill them,' he recalled. 'In Gaza, the terrorists filmed a video of them and then separated them. In January 2024, we received a first vague sign of life, but after Almog and three other hostages were rescued, Hamas moved all remaining captives underground and intelligence lost contact.' Guy’s mother, Miri Gilboa Dalal, told Ynet: 'I see hostages coming out and hope my son’s turn is coming. I was shocked when Eli Sharabi and Ohad Ben Ami were released.

The handover was reportedly pushed back to 8:00 p.m. Israeli officials confirmed the reports and linked the delay to a security assessment set to be held by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later in the evening regarding a possible implementation of the second phase of the deal with Hamas.

Over 60 hostages still in Gaza after six releases as Israel mulls...	Return of six living hostages marks penultimate captive handover in cease-fire's first phase, with officials assessing options for further releases during the second phase's negotiations The seventh handover of living hostages in the first phase of Israel’s cease-fire deal with Hamas was completed on Saturday with six hostages released: Tal Shoham and Avera Mengistu from Rafah, Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov and Eliya Cohen from the Nuseirat refugee camp and Hisham al-Sayed from Gaza City. Megnistu and al-Sayed were held captive for a decade, while the other four, abducted on October 7, endured 505 days in captivity. The latest handover marked the final release of live hostages in the deal’s first phase, which included 33 hostages in total. So far, 29 Israelis have been freed during the first phase, including this week's release of the bodies of hostages murdered in captivity — Shiri Bibas and her children, Ariel and Kfir, along with Oded Lifshitz. Four more bodies are set to be returned as part of the deal next week, including Shlomo Mansour, who has already been officially declared deceased. This will mark the final week of the first phase, which lasted 42 days.

Talks for the deal’s second phase, which is meant to secure the release of all remaining live hostages and end the war in Gaza, have not officially begun and its prospects remain unclear. Negotiations are expected to be complex, with Israel demanding all terror groups in the Strip disarm themselves. On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wanted to resume fighting 'He’s not divided on this decision. He wants to continue,' he said. Another possibility raised is extending the first phase with additional hostage releases. Under the agreed framework, the temporary cease-fire could continue as long as negotiations for the second phase progress, even beyond the initial 42-day period.

I condemned Hamas—my own family blocked me': Arab peace activist...	Lebanese-born activist Rawan Osman once supported Hezbollah but is now a proud Zionist fighting antisemitism; visiting Israel, she spoke to Ynetnews about her transformation, the backlash she faced, her conversion to Judaism and the need to reclaim Israel’s narrative Rawan Osman, a pro-Israel activist of Lebanese-Syrian descent now based in Germany, has become a prominent voice challenging antisemitism in the Arab world. During a visit to Israel, she spoke to Ynetnews about her transformation from a Hezbollah supporter to a vocal Zionist, her work on the documentary Tragic Awakening and her decision to convert to Judaism. Osman, who grew up in Lebanon, was raised on a state-sanctioned narrative that demonized Israel. 'I was a fan of Hezbollah. I believed the narrative the state wanted us to learn about Israel and the Jews,' she said. 'I'd never spoken to a Jew until I moved to France in my twenties and lived in the Jewish quarter. That was my first encounter with Jews, and that opened my eyes.' Her shift in perspective was not immediate but developed over years of reading about Israel and Jewish history. 'It sounds as if it happened overnight, but that was a long journey,' she explained. 'Slowly, after years of reading about Israel and Jewish history, I became a proud Zionist activist. And after October 7, that event changed my life.' Osman has traveled to Auschwitz and visited Israeli communities near Gaza, deepening her understanding of Jewish suffering. She is baffled by the continued global support for Hamas despite the October 7 massacre. 'I don't understand how anyone can buy their narrative,' she said. 'I just read this morning—like many around the world, we don’t want to believe the Bibas family was killed. They are monsters, and learning that the aggressor is your own side, not Israel, is a harsh realization. I'm trying desperately to get Arabs to understand that they are intensely brainwashed.' She is outspoken about what she sees as the real threat in the region. 'Every day, it becomes clearer that the enemy of the people in the region is not Israel, but the so-called 'Axis of Resistance' led by Iran or by the Iranian regime. The Iranian people are awesome and they deserve better.' Osman’s outspoken stance has come at a price. 'I still have many family members and friends in Lebanon and Syria. Most of them blocked me right after October 7 when I made a public statement condemning Hamas and supporting Israel,' she said. 'Many out of fear, but many just because they are antisemites, as I was until my mid-twenties.' > She has also faced threats, particularly from Palestinian communities. 'I did receive many death threats in Germany. There is a criminal investigator I report some of them to, but as they say, 'A dog that barks rarely bites.' Those who want to kill me won’t inform me in advance,' she said. 'I have to be careful where I'm invited to speak publicly. We have heavy security, but I truly believe I'm doing the right thing, so it doesn’t bother me at all.' Osman confirmed that she is in the process of converting to Judaism, a decision she chose to share publicly despite warnings that doing so might weaken her impact as an Arab ally. 'I'm not considering converting to Judaism—I am converting to Judaism,' she stated. 'Many people told me that I shouldn't share that I'm converting. Being an Arab Muslim ally is more valuable. However, converting to Judaism is not my dirty secret, and there's nothing to be ashamed of. It's something I'm proud of and I'd like the Jews to understand that it is something you should be proud of. There's nothing wrong with you and everything wrong with the world.' Osman believes that the suppression of Israel’s narrative in the Arab world is a major obstacle to peace. 'Many Arab countries have anti-normalization laws and policies forbidding people-to-people contact,' she explained. 'Arab citizens, including Lebanese, are afraid of communicating with Israelis because of these laws, even abroad when they are on holiday. But thanks to social media, the Jews can reclaim their space, reclaim their voices and communicate their narrative, exposing the lies told for very long in the Arab world.' Through her work with filmmaker Rabbi Raphael Shore, Osman has been exposed to a different way of understanding antisemitism. 'The notion that the Jews are the world's conscience, and they have been a pain for fascist regimes, was an eye-opening idea,' she said. 'The Jewish nation excelled. It became a remarkable country in spite of the Holocaust. But many are bothered by the Jewish saying, 'No matter who you are, no matter how high your position is, you're still a human being, and God created us equal, so I will challenge whoever I want to challenge.' Despite the challenges and threats she faces, Osman remains steadfast in her advocacy. 'I truly believe I'm doing the right thing,' she said. 'And that gives me all the strength I need.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rjup1mxq1l	2025-02-22T02:10:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/B1Y0OGQq1e/B1Y0OGQq1e_549_578_918_517_0_small.jpg

Hamas seeks one-time hostage exchange amid cease-fire talks	Terror group accuses Israel of delaying second phase talks in 'attempt to evade agreement'; Hamas demands full cease-fire, Israeli withdrawal and prisoner releases, while Israel insists on Gaza's demilitarization and Hamas leaders' exile Hamas announced Saturday that it is prepared to complete the second phase of the hostage deal in a single exchange, setting conditions that include a permanent cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem reiterated the group's stance, saying, 'The only path to freeing the hostages is through negotiations and Israel’s commitment to the terms of the agreement.' The group warned against 'attempts to evade the deal', accusing Israel of delaying its implementation. As discussions over a potential second phase of the cease-fire and hostage release continue, Israeli officials have outlined their own demands, including Hamas relinquishing control of Gaza, demilitarization of the territory, exile of top Hamas leaders and no transfer of control to the Palestinian Authority. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, who was appointed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to lead Israel’s negotiating team, has traveled to Miami for talks with U.S. presidential envoy Steve Witkoff. Witkoff, representing President Donald Trump, has been holding shuttle diplomacy talks with Qatari, Egyptian and Israeli officials in an effort to broker a breakthrough. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: A senior Israeli source said Witkoff is 'determined to secure a deal,' suggesting he may attempt to 'impose an agreement' on Netanyahu. Another Israeli official described the U.S. role in negotiations as 'highly active,' emphasizing that American involvement is crucial in advancing the talks. Netanyahu has instructed Dermer’s team to continue discussions with Witkoff, but any progress will require approval from the Security Cabinet. A source familiar with the talks said, 'Netanyahu is playing both sides—preparing for either a return to fighting or a second-phase deal. It all depends on what Witkoff delivers.' Israel is preparing for a possible request from Witkoff to send negotiation teams to Doha as early as next week. Several scenarios remain on the table: Extension of the current cease-fire and hostage releases, finalizing an agreement for a second phase or breakdown in talks and a return to full-scale military operations. Meanwhile, the seventh round of hostage releases was underway on Saturday, with six Israeli captives expected to be freed from Gaza, amid heightened tensions over the fragile cease-fire. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkxs11qvcye	2025-02-22T01:15:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/22/BJ2sYxwq1x/BJ2sYxwq1x_0_78_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

His release, alongside Tal Shoham, follows years of advocacy from Israel’s Ethiopian community, which criticized the government for failing to secure his freedom sooner After nearly 11 years in Hamas captivity, Avera Mengistu returned to Israel after being released on Saturday as part of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. Mengistu was freed alongside Tal Shoham, who was abducted during the Oct. 7 massacre. Both men walked on their own when Hamas staged a ceremony before handing them over to the Red Cross, which then transferred them to the IDF. Mengistu, who suffers from mental health challenges, crossed into Gaza in 2014 on his own, walking across the border near a beach in southern Israel. He had been held by the terror group ever since. Israel’s Ethiopian community had long fought for his release, demanding that the government do more to secure his freedom. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In a video clip released in 2023, his family saw the first sign of life from Mengistu.

'They were threatened that if they spoke out, Avera would remain in Gaza,' she said. 'We understood that he was left there because the government did not want to get him out. It could have claimed humanitarian reasons but did nothing. We were unable to draw public attention. He is mentally ill and Ethiopian—two difficult identities.

Eliya Cohen Eliya Cohen was abducted from the Nova music festival where he was with his partner Ziv, her nephew Amit Ben-Avida and his partner Karin Schwartzman who were both murdered in the massacre. When the attack began, the four sought shelter in what was later dubbed 'the shelter of death.' After Eliya was taken hostage, Ziv found out he had intended to propose marriage and had even purchased an engagement ring for her. Sigi, Eliya's mother last week said she was shocked to learn the horrific conditions in which her son and Alon Ohel were being held, after she received information from hostages who were freed earlier. They were bound in chains and held in terrible conditions, the family said. Omer Wankrat Omer and his friends arrived at the Nova music festival just an hour before the Hamas massacre began. 'I'm scared to death,' he said in his last message to his family. Niva his mother said the family knew Omer and his friend Kim Damti, who was massacred, stopped at a shelter that had come under attack. Eight grenades were hurled into it killing Kim and others. Omer was one of the few who survived. He is the oldest of three siblings born to Shai and Niva. At 14 he was diagnosed with colitis and was in grave danger during his captivity. 'He is a loving brother who has special ties to his siblings. He is friendly and sociable and had developed a love of cooking, into which he invested time and money. His dream was to be a restaurant critic. He is independent and hard working as has been earning his own living since he was 17. He ran a Chef's restaurant where he worked very hard. Omer Shem Tov Omer, 22, was abducted from the Nova music festival and held in captivity with Itay and Mia Regev who were freed in November 2023. 'I hope he knows we've been turning the world on its head trying to get him out and that he is not alone,' Omer's father Malachi said. 'I wish I could send him a message that would keep him strong. We tried to get medications to him and I hope they were delivered. I imagined to myself that if he received them, he would have realized how much was being done for his release.

U.S. Christian leaders to sign resolution backing Israeli soverei...	The resolution states: 'We reaffirm the Jewish people’s inalienable right to the Biblical Heartland of Israel and reject all efforts—both from the United States and the international community—to pressure the Jewish people to relinquish their ancestral homeland' American Christian Leaders for Israel (ACLI) at the National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) convention will sign a resolution this week reaffirming the Jewish people’s right to Judea and Samaria (the West Bank). The resolution, set to be formally released on February 25 in Dallas, Texas, follows a similar declaration by the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). It also comes ahead of an expected announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump within the next two weeks. Earlier this month, during a press conference in Washington with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said he would make an announcement regarding Israeli annexation of the West Bank in about four weeks. After meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah II, Trump told reporters who asked about his stance on the issue, 'That’s going to work out very well… work out automatically.' The ACLI resolution affirms the importance of Jewish sovereignty over the region. 'We reaffirm the Jewish people’s inalienable right to the Biblical Heartland of Israel and reject all efforts—both from the United States and the international community—to pressure the Jewish people to relinquish their ancestral homeland in Judea and Samaria,' the resolution states. It also highlights the positive impact of Jewish presence in the region, citing contributions to religious freedom, the protection of historical sites, and improved living conditions for all residents. As part of this initiative, ACLI is urging its members to reject any international efforts to pressure Israel into giving up control of Judea and Samaria. The resolution will be signed by ACLI members, a network of around 3,000 Christian pastors and organizational leaders, including the NRB. It will also be presented to Trump. 'We recognize the undeniable biblical and historical ties of the Jewish people to this land and have consistently brought this issue to the attention of our members, elected officials, the media, and corporate America,' said NRB CEO Troy Miller. 'We reaffirm our commitment to standing with Israel against any challenge to its rightful sovereignty.' Dr. Susan Michael, director of ACLI and president of the International Christian Embassy Jerusalem’s U.S. branch (ICEJ-USA), added: 'This resolution is a crucial affirmation of the Jewish people’s undeniable connection to the biblical heartland. At a time when Israel’s sovereignty is under relentless attack, it is vital that we stand firm in recognizing Israelis’ historical, legal, and moral rights to their ancestral homeland. Any decision involving the destiny of Judea and Samaria must be made by Israel with no pressure from the U.S. or the international community.' Similarly, at CPAC, held from February 19 to 22, a statement of support for Israel was read by CPAC Board Member K.T. McFarland on February 20. The organization acknowledged the presence of representatives from Jewish communities in the biblical heartland and declared, 'We believe all these areas are integral parts of Israel. The United States of America and her allies should recognize Israel’s sovereignty over these lands.' CPAC took place at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in Maryland and welcomed top conservative political and cultural figures, including Vice President J.D. Vance and Elon Musk. 'Everywhere I go, Bible-believing Christians are speaking about the real possibility of Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria,' said Josh Reinstein, president of the Israel Allies Foundation. 'With President Trump’s statement on the issue only a week or two away, many Christians believe they could be witnessing the fulfillment of biblical prophecy yet again.' Trump first raised the idea of supporting annexation during his first term, largely influenced by then-U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman. Just as Israel was poised to move forward, the decision was delayed as part of an agreement with the United Arab Emirates, which became the Abraham Accords. The agreement included a three-year delay on discussions about annexation, which has since expired. Trump’s original Mideast peace plan, the Deal of the Century, supported annexing up to 40% of Area C into Israel.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkerzxpc1x	2025-02-21T21:54:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/22/SJ2TQlD9ke/SJ2TQlD9ke_0_4_968_545_0_small.jpg

Trump fires top US general in unprecedented Pentagon shakeup	In a post on Truth Social prsident says that he would nominate former Lieutenant General Dan 'Razin' Caine to succeed Brown, breaking with tradition by pulling someone out of retirement for the first time to become the top military officer President Donald Trump on Friday fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General C.Q. Brown, and pushed out five other admirals and generals in an unprecedented shake-up of U.S. military leadership. Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he would nominate former Lieutenant General Dan 'Razin' Caine to succeed Brown, breaking with tradition by pulling someone out of retirement for the first time to become the top military officer. The president will also replace the head of the U.S. Navy, a position held by Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the first woman to lead a military service, as well as the air force vice chief of staff, the Pentagon said. He is also removing the judge advocates general for the Army, Navy and Air Force, critical positions that ensure enforcement of military justice. Trump's decision sets off a period of upheaval at the Pentagon, which was already bracing for mass firings of civilian staff, a dramatic overhaul of its budget and a shift in military deployments under Trump's new America First foreign policy. While the Pentagon's civilian leadership changes from one administration to the next, the uniformed members of the U.S. armed forces are meant to be apolitical, carrying out the policies of Democratic and Republican administrations. Brown, the second Black officer to become the president's top uniformed military adviser, was serving a four-year term meant to end in September 2027. A U.S. official said Brown was relieved with immediate effect, before the Senate confirms his successor. Reuters in November was first to report that the incoming Trump administration planned a sweeping shakeup of the top brass, with firings including Brown. Democratic lawmakers condemned the decision by Trump, a Republican. 'Firing uniformed leaders as a type of political loyalty test, or for reasons relating to diversity and gender that have nothing to do with performance, erodes the trust and professionalism that our servicemembers require to achieve their missions,' said Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Representative Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat, said the firings were 'un-American, unpatriotic, and dangerous for our troops and our national security,' he said. 'This is the definition of politicizing our military.' Woke Generals During last year's presidential campaign, Trump spoke of firing 'woke' generals and those responsible for the troubled 2021 pullout from Afghanistan. But on Friday, the president did not explain his decision to replace Brown. 'I want to thank General Charles 'CQ' Brown for his over 40 years of service to our country, including as our current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is a fine gentleman and an outstanding leader, and I wish a great future for him and his family,' Trump wrote. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had been skeptical of Brown before taking the helm of the Pentagon with a broad agenda that includes eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the military. In his most recent book, Hegseth, a former Fox News personality and military veteran, asked whether Brown would have gotten the job if he were not Black. 'Was it because of his skin color? Or his skill? We'll never know, but always doubt - which on its face seems unfair to CQ. But since he has made the race card one of his biggest calling cards, it doesn't really much matter,' he wrote in his 2024 book 'The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.' Brown, a former fighter pilot who has held commands in the Middle East and Asia, recounted experiencing discrimination in the military in an emotional video posted online after the 2020 killing of George Floyd, which sparked nationwide protests for racial justice. Brown was on official travel when Trump made the announcement. Hours before Trump's announcement, Brown's official X account had posted images of him meeting troops on the U.S. border with Mexico, deployed in support of Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration. 'Border Security has always been critical to the defense of our homeland. As we navigate unprecedented security challenges... we will ensure our troops at the border have everything they need,' Brown posted.

Shiri Bibas murdered in captivity, Kibbutz Nir Oz says	Earlier Shiri's remains arrived for identification at the National Institute of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv after being transfered to the IDF by the Red Cross on Friday Kibbutz Nir Oz announced early on Saturday that Shiri Bibas was murdered in captivity after she was abducted in the massacre of Oct. 7 with her two little boys Ariel and Kfir. The announcement came hours after her remains were returned to Israel 'Shiri who was abducted at the age of 32 was born and raised at Nir Oz. For years she had cared for the children of the Kibbutz with dedication as part of the education system and was beloved by all who knew her. In the last two years she worked at the Kibbutz accounting department but was first and foremost a dedicated mother with unending love,' Nir Oz said in a statement. 'Shiri, Yarden, Ariel and Kfir loved their home at Nir Oz, their porch and front lawn where they spend endless happy moment as a family and from where they were all abducted on October 7. Shiri's parents Yossi and Margit Silverman were murdered on that auwful day. Today, after 16 unbearable months, there is painful closure for the family. Shiri and her little boys will return for their final resting on Israeli soil. Shiri was survived by her husband, sister and nephews, loving family and friends who will always remember her smile, kindness and the joy she had spread. May the memory of Shiri Ariel and Kfir be blessed.' Earlier Shiri's remains arrived for identification at the National Institute of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv after being transfered to the IDF by the Red Cross on Friday after a body of an unknown female was handed over with the remains of the two boys. According to the IDF, the mother and her baby boys were brutally murdered and the terrorists attempted to mask their attrocity by mutilating their bodies to make it appear as if they had died from an IDF bombing. Contrary to Hamas's lies, Ariel and Kfir were not killed in an airstrike. Ariel and Kfir Bibas were murdered by terrorists in cold blood.

Israel expands manhunt after bus bombing suspects	IDF deploys checkpoints across West Bank, particularly near Tulkarm, in effort to disrupt suspects' escape; explosive devices, planted in crowded bus compartments, designed to cause mass casualties, Shin Bet says Israeli forces continued their manhunt Friday for the perpetrators behind coordinated bus bombings in central Israel, deploying checkpoints across the West Bank, particularly near Tulkarm, in an effort to disrupt their escape. The explosive devices, planted in crowded bus compartments, were designed to cause mass casualties, according to the Shin Bet security agency, which classified the attack as a 'severe terrorist act.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the Tulkarm refugee camp following the attack, where a local Hamas terrorist unit hinted at responsibility. Surrounded by Israeli troops, Netanyahu vowed an intensified crackdown. 'We are entering terrorist strongholds, leveling entire streets and eliminating terrorists,' he said. 'I have ordered reinforcements in the West Bank and additional operations against terror hubs.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On Thursday, four explosive devices were planted on buses in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. Three detonated almost simultaneously in bus depots in Bat Yam, while a fourth, found near Wolfson Medical Center in Holon, was defused. The attackers had planned a 'mega attack,' but the buses were empty at the time, preventing casualties. Israeli authorities arrested three suspects Friday, including some Israeli Jews, for allegedly assisting the attackers. The device recovered in Holon weighed approximately 5 kg (11 lbs) and bore an inscription in Arabic reading: 'Revenge from Tulkarem.' During his visit to Tulkarm, Netanyahu accused Hamas and other terror factions of continuing their efforts to strike Israel. 'What we witnessed yesterday—an attempt to carry out mass-casualty chain bombings—is extremely serious,' he said. 'We have reinforced our forces in the West Bank and launched additional counterterror operations.' Defense Minister Israel Katz also visited Tulkarm, saying, 'These terrorist attacks targeting civilians will not deter us.' A senior Hamas military commander in Tulkarm issued a statement in response, warning Israel that 'all Netanyahu’s attempts to dismantle the jihad project will fail, and what is coming will be even worse.' Hamas further dismissed Netanyahu’s visit as 'a political and military failure' and called it 'a provocative stunt to cover his repeated failures against the Palestinian resistance.' The latest bombings come amid heightened Israeli military operations in the West Bank. Hamas' Tulkarm military unit, which implied responsibility for the attack, vowed continued violence. 'The revenge of our martyrs will not be forgotten as long as the occupation remains on our land,' the group said in a statement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjxczviqke	2025-02-21T11:44:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/08/rJ11HdR1St1g/rJ11HdR1St1g_1_46_1601_901_0_small.jpg

Al Jazeera claims terror group transferred remains to Red Cross; humanitarian group confirms summoned to retrieve coffin in Gaza and is en route to designated location Hamas has handed over a coffin to the Red Cross, claiming it contains the remains of Israeli hostage Shiri Bibas, Al Jazeera reported on Friday. The report follows Hamas' widely condemned move on Thursday, when it returned the body of an unidentified Gazan woman instead of Bibas, the mother of two young boys—Kfir and Ariel Bibas—who, according to Israeli intelligence, were brutally murdered in captivity. An Israeli official said authorities have contacted the Red Cross for verification. The humanitarian organization confirmed it had been summoned to retrieve a coffin in Gaza and was en route to the designated location. The IDF said it is also reviewing the claim but has yet to receive confirmation. Earlier, IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari reiterated that forensic analysis and intelligence indicate Kfir and Ariel Bibas were killed in November 2023 by their captors in Gaza. 'The additional body received was not that of Shiri Bibas and did not match any known hostage,' Hagari said, calling Hamas' actions a 'grave violation' of the agreement requiring the return of four deceased hostages. 'We demand Hamas return Shiri Bibas alongside all our hostages—both the living and the fallen.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also addressed the situation, vowing to act 'resolutely' to bring Shiri home. He warned Hamas that it would 'pay the full price for this cruel and cynical violation of the agreement,' adding, 'The sacred memory of Oded Lifshitz and of Ariel and Kfir Bibas will be forever enshrined in the heart of the nation.

US president blasts terror group for handling of return of Bibas family’s remains, calling scene 'barbaric' and 'unbelievable in modern era'; he expresses support for Netanyahu’s stance on continuing Gaza operations, criticizing Biden’s opposition to past incursions U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday condemned Hamas for its handling of the bodies of the Bibas children and the group’s failure to return their mother, Shiri. In an interview with Fox News Radio, Trump called the scene of the children's bodies being transferred 'unbelievable' and 'barbaric.' 'It looked like they were celebrating when they brought the bodies. It was a horrific, brutal scene—hard to believe this is happening in the modern era,' Trump said. He expressed support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s military campaign in Gaza, suggesting that Netanyahu was determined to continue the fight against Hamas. 'He’s angry, and rightfully so, especially after what happened with the babies yesterday. It was terrible, really tough. He’s not divided on this decision. He wants to continue,' Trump said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Trump acknowledged the dilemma between eliminating Hamas and securing the release of hostages but said he would support any decision Netanyahu makes. 'I’m okay with whatever he decides. I really am,' he said. Trump also criticized his predecessor Joe Biden’s opposition to an IDF incursion into the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah in May last year, saying Netanyahu should not feel constrained by Washington. 'Sometimes you have to make tough decisions, and this is a tough decision,' Trump added. Addressing the condition of recently released hostages Eli Sharabi, Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy, Trump said, 'They looked like they came out of a concentration camp. They wanted to release those who looked the best first.' When asked about his proposal for control over Gaza, Trump clarified, 'I wouldn’t enforce it, I would recommend it,' and described Israel’s 2005 disengagement from Gaza as 'a terrible real estate deal.' Meanwhile, White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz responded to the Israeli military's confirmation that Hamas had murdered Bibas brothers Kfir and Ariel, rather than them being killed in an airstrike. 'The Bibas children were murdered by Hamas, not mistakenly bombed. This is pure evil,' Waltz said. 'Hamas must be destroyed. Our prayers are with the Bibas family and all Israelis in the face of this unspeakable violence.' IDF: Bibas children brutally murdered in early weeks of war IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari on Friday delivered one of his most emotional statements since the October 7 Hamas attacks, revealing chilling details about the fate of Kfir and Ariel Bibas. Hagari dismissed Hamas' claims that the young brothers were killed in an Israeli airstrike, stating that forensic evidence confirms they were murdered in cold blood by their captors. Ariel and Kfir Bibas were murdered by terrorists in cold blood,' Hagari said. 'The terrorists did not shoot the two young boys, they killed them with their bare hands. Afterward, they committed horrific acts to cover up these atrocities. He added that forensic analysis, combined with intelligence assessments, indicates that the bodies were mutilated to obscure the cause of death and falsely blame Israel for their killings. Hagari also addressed Hamas’ failure to return the body of the children's mother, Shiri Bibas, saying, 'The body that Hamas falsely claimed was Shiri, was not hers, and not of any other hostage. Hamas sent over the body of an anonymous woman. This is further evidence of Hamas’ barbaric cruelty,' and accusing the Palestinian terrorist group of violating the cease-fire-for-hostages agreement. The IDF has shared its findings with international partners, urging them to publicly confirm both the intelligence and forensic evidence, Hagari said. 'The entire world will know exactly how the Hamas terrorist organization operates,' he added. Hagari also spoke about his meeting with Yarden Bibas, the father of Kfir and Ariel, who was abducted during the October 7 attack and released earlier this month as part of a hostage deal. 'Yarden looked me in the eyes last night and asked that the world know and be horrified by the way his children were murdered,' Hagari said. 'The murder of children is a crime against every moral, ethical and religious standard—even in Islam. Yarden, the entire nation shares your pain and is waiting for Shiri to come home.' He reaffirmed Israel’s commitment to securing the return of all remaining hostages, saying, 'We are obligated to do everything in our power to bring Shiri and all those still held captive back home as soon as possible.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjf2f4i5ye	2025-02-21T09:14:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/11/SkU6p9dFyx/SkU6p9dFyx_0_204_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

In a special video shared by the family, she goes through the suitcase she prepared for her son, who will return to Israel after 505 days in captivity. Along with Omer’s close friend, Adi Taub, they go over the clothes packed for him and the items they bought, including a new phone to replace the one that was found shattered at the site of the Nova music festival, from which he was abducted on October 7. The family also packed perfume and an electric razor in the suitcase, which, according to his mother, has been waiting in the living room for 503 days. In the video, Adi films everything so she can show it to Omer when he returns. 'I've been waiting for this day since the moment we realized Omer had been kidnapped,' Niva shared. 'The suitcase has been sitting in our living room for 503 days.' Throughout the months, she replaced the new clothes in the suitcase according to the changing seasons.

Despite the fact that Shiri Bibas will not be returned along with the bodies of her children, Ariel and Kfir, Israel is not expected to jeopardize the release of the six living hostages. However, the defense establishment is reportedly considering recommending that the government issue an ultimatum to Hamas in the coming day. Earlier, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed retaliation in response to what he called Hamas’ 'cruel and malicious violation' of agreements. He stated that the terrorist group’s brutality 'knows no bounds' and promised: 'Hamas will pay the price.' Omer Wankrat arrived at the Nova festival just an hour before Hamas launched its attack. The last message he managed to send his family at 7:01 a.m. on October 7 was: 'I’m terrified.' Since then—504 days—he has been in Hamas captivity. Tomorrow, at long last, he is expected to be freed from his nightmare. Omer, 23, from Gedera, is the eldest of three children, the son of Shay and Niva. At age 14, he was diagnosed with colitis. Describing her son’s character, his mother said, 'He’s a wonderful brother. He has a very special bond with his siblings. He’s always smiling, loves people, very social—a magnet for others. His dream is to be a restaurant critic. He’s independent and hardworking—he started working to support himself at 17.

US: Hamas 'going to face total annihilation'	Adam Boehler, President Donald Trump's envoy for hostage affairs, called terror group's failure to provide Shir Bibas' body 'horrific' and 'clear violation' of cease-fire While the Trump administration did not issue an official statement following the revelation that what was believed to be the body of Shiri Bibas was a Gazan woman, Adam Boehler, President Donald Trump's envoy for hostage affairs, called Hamas’s actions 'horrific' and a 'clear violation' of the cease-fire. 'If I were them, I’d release everybody or they are going to face total annihilation,' he warned in an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN. Boehler added that Israel had informed senior U.S. officials in advance that the remains were not those of Shiri and that forensic evidence confirmed her sons, Ariel and Kfir, were brutally murdered in November 2023 in captivity.

Condemnations for the murder of the children arrived from across the globe. Germany’s ambassador to Israel Steffen Seibert said: 'The unbearable has been confirmed: Ariel and Kfir Bibas, two small German citizens, were taken by ruthless terrorists and killed in captivity.' Kfir and Ariel's father, Yarden, is a German citizen. 'Let us remember them as they were—alive, young, radiant, and full of promise. What happened to Shiri? On top of everything else, Hamas are cruel liars,' he added British Ambassador to Israel Simon Walters said: 'The Israeli authorities have now confirmed from forensic evidence that the little Bibas children were murdered in captivity. This is a gruesome new low, compounded by the failure to return the body of Shiri, their mother. May Kfir and Ariel rest in peace.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1hrlju51e	2025-02-21T02:56:16-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/14/ryvRnm6Kkg/ryvRnm6Kkg_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Counterterrorism units tracked Uzbek national, gaining access to his email, where they found evidence of planned attacks on potential targets included synagogues and Jewish schools Turkish security forces have arrested an Uzbek national with ties to an Islamic State affiliate in Asia who was allegedly planning attacks on Jewish institutions in Turkey, authorities said on Friday. The suspect entered Turkey legally from a European country and was not previously known to local authorities, according to reports. Counterterrorism units tracked him and gained access to his email, where they found evidence of ongoing communication with a foreign national as the two planned the attacks. Security officials said the suspect was found hiding in an apartment in Istanbul, where he was taken into custody. Authorities did not specify when the attacks were planned to take place but said potential targets included synagogues and Jewish schools in Turkey and other unnamed countries.

Security officials mulling retaliatory measures for terror group's failure to return the body of Shiri Bibas, mother of Kfir and Ariel - who the IDF says were brutally murdered while in captivity Despite Hamas failing to transfer the body of Israeli hostage Shiri Bibas, with the received remains later identified as a Gazan woman, Israel's priorities remain the same: Ensure that the first phase of the cease-fire deal proceeds as planned and as smoothly as possible. Six living hostages are scheduled to be released during Saturday's exchange. Families notified that their loved ones are set to return include the relatives of Tal Shoham, Omer Wankrat, Omer Shem Tov, Avera Mengistu, Hisham al-Sayed, and Eliya Cohen. In addition, four more hostage bodies are planned to be handed over next week - which will mark the end of the first phase of the agreement with Hamas. Once that phase is complete—assuming it proceeds smoothly—Israel is expected to hold a critical discussion on the second stage of the deal. Meanwhile, security officials are likely to recommend retaliatory measures in response to what they consider a serious violation of the agreement regarding Shiri Bibas. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: One option under consideration is advising the government to issue an ultimatum to Hamas within the next 24 hours regarding the return of Shiri Bibas, which could include halting some of the concessions Israel has made as part of the deal. Hamas claimed Friday morning that Bibas' remains appear to have been mixed with other human remains from the rubble after an Israeli air strike hit the place she was held in. The IDF stated that per intelligence, Ariel and Kfir were brutally murdered in captivity sometime around November 2023. Earlier Friday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed retribution over the perceived violation of the agreement. Hours after the bodies of Oded Lifshitz and the two Bibas children were identified, Netanyahu did not clarify what had happened to Shiri Bibas but confirmed that instead of her, the body of a Gazan woman was returned to Israel. 'The State of Israel bows its head in mourning for two small children, innocent babies, brothers—Ariel and Kfir Bibas, of blessed memory—and for Oded Lifshitz, of blessed memory, one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz. All three were brutally murdered in Hamas captivity in the early weeks of the war. The cruelty of the Hamas monsters knows no bounds,' Netanyahu said. He continued, 'Not only did they abduct the father, Yarden Bibas, the young mother, Shiri, and their two small babies. In an unimaginable act of cynicism, they did not return Shiri alongside her little angels. Instead, they placed the body of a Gazan woman in the casket.' Netanyahu vowed to 'act decisively' to bring Shiri home, 'along with all our hostages—both the living and the fallen.' He also issued a direct warning to Hamas, one day before the next hostage release, stating: 'We will ensure Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and wicked violation of the agreement.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1anr6h5jl	2025-02-21T01:37:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/Sy37JEf9kx/Sy37JEf9kx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

While the attendees have diplomatic and security experience, they are not government officials and it was not immediately clear if any were sent by their governments, two of the sources said. The sources declined to identify the attendees. The sources described the talks as a side channel with some contacts occurring during the transition period following U.S. President Donald Trump's Nov. 5 election victory. At least a small number of advisers to Trump are aware of the encounters, said one of the sources, who had direct knowledge of the matter.

Four explosive devices, each weighing about five kilograms and equipped with a timer, were placed on at transportation depots in the Tel Aviv area It was reported on Friday that the Shin Bet arrested three suspects for allegedly assisting in planting explosive devices on buses in the Tel Aviv area, in what authorities believe was a botched terror attack. It was also reported that some of the detainees identified as Jewish Israelis. While security forces continue investigating the suspected attack—in which bombs exploded on three buses at two Bat Yam depots—extensive searches were conducted Friday morning on public buses across major cities, with the IDF deployed three reinforcement battalions to the West Bank. Four explosive devices, each weighing about five kilograms and equipped with a timer, were placed on several buses. Three detonated Thursday night in Bat Yam, while a fourth was discovered and neutralized near Wolfson Hospital in Holon. No injuries were reported. One of the bombs bore the inscription 'Revenge from Tulkarm,' with Hamas’ terror branch in the West Bank city later hinting at its involvement. In response, the Transportation Ministry ordered overnight inspections of all bus depots, with security reinforcements extended to the Jerusalem light rail and increased police presence across public transportation hubs. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi directed forces to intensify operations along security zones based on intelligence findings. As part of these efforts, three additional IDF battalions from the Kfir, Nahal, and Commando brigades were deployed to the West Bank on Friday morning. Meanwhile, the IDF confirmed that the main phase of Operation Iron Wall, aimed at dismantling terrorist networks in northern West Bank refugee camps, has concluded. While forces completed sweeps in Jenin and other key locations, a permanent Kfir Brigade unit remains for ongoing raids, particularly in Tulkarm and Nur Shams. Following a late-night security briefing, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the suspected attack and vowed a forceful response against West Bank terror networks. Defense Minister Israel Katz ordered a ramping up of operations in West Bank refugee camps, stating: 'We will hunt down the terrorists relentlessly and dismantle the terror infrastructure that serves as an outpost for Iran’s axis of evil.

Lebanon's Hezbollah to bury Nasrallah in mass funeral	Terror group's leader was killed on September 27 in an Israeli airstrike as he met fellow commanders in Beirut, a stunning blow in early phase of offensive that left the Iranian proxy a shadow of its former self Lebanon's Hezbollah will bury its former leader Hassan Nasrallah on Sunday nearly five months after he was killed in an Israeli airstrike, in a mass funeral aimed at showing political strength after the group emerged badly weakened from last year's war. Nasrallah was killed on September 27 in an Israeli airstrike as he met commanders in a bunker in Beirut's southern suburbs, a stunning blow in the early phase of an Israeli offensive that has left the Iran-backed group a shadow of its former self. Revered by Hezbollah supporters, Nasrallah led the Shi'ite Muslim group through decades of conflict with Israel, overseeing its transformation into a military force with regional sway and becoming one of the most prominent Arab figures in generations. The funeral in Beirut's southern suburbs will also honor Hashem Safieddine, who led Hezbollah for one week after Nasrallah's death before he was also killed by Israel, underlining how deeply Israeli intelligence had penetrated the paramilitary group. He will be buried in the south on Monday. 'The funeral is a launchpad for the next phase. A great funeral that draws hundreds of thousands is a way of telling everyone that Hezbollah still exists, that it is still the main Shi'ite actor in Lebanon,' said Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center. Israel killed thousands of Hezbollah fighters and inflicted huge destruction in Beirut's southern suburbs and other areas of Lebanon where its supporters live. The impact on Hezbollah was compounded by the ousting of its ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria, severing the supply route to Iran. Its weakened stature has been reflected in Lebanon's post-war politics, with the group unable to impose its will in the formation of a new government and language legitimizing its arsenal omitted from the new cabinet's policy statement. Sheikh Sadeq al-Nabulsi, a cleric close to Hezbollah, said adversaries in Lebanon and abroad believed the group had been defeated, but the funeral would be a message that this was not the case. It would be a 'battle to prove Hezbollah's existence'. The ceremony will be held at Lebanon's biggest sports arena - Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium on the outskirts of the Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs. Nasrallah will then be buried at a dedicated site nearby. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi will attend, an Iranian official said. Several leaders of Iraqi Shi'ite militias are also expected to attend. Iraqi Airways has added flights to Beirut to cope with extra demand from Iraqis who want to travel to Beirut for the funeral, a spokesperson for the Iraqi transportation ministry said. Nasrallah's death was a huge blow to Iran, whose Revolutionary Guards established Hezbollah in 1982. Supporters remember him for standing up to Israel and defying the United States. To his foes, he was head of a terrorist organization and a proxy for Iran's Shi'ite Islamist theocracy in its tussle for influence in the Middle East. After he was killed, Nasrallah was buried temporarily next to his son, Hadi, who died fighting for Hezbollah in 1997. His official funeral was scheduled to allow time for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from south Lebanon under the terms of a U.S.-backed ceasefire which ended last year's war. Though Israel has largely withdrawn from the south, its troops continue to hold five hilltop positions in the area, which Hezbollah battled for years to liberate from Israeli forces before they withdrew in 2000. The conflict spiraled after Hezbollah opened fire in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas at the start of the Gaza war, on October 8, 2023. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkqzpnh9ke	2025-02-21T00:06:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/06/HkzHdEad11kg/HkzHdEad11kg_0_66_2200_1239_0_small.jpg

Al-Mujahedeen: The fringe terror group behind murder of Bibas chi...	Radical Salafi organization operated independently in Gaza for over two decades; faction falsely claims Bibas family was killed in Israeli airstrike, though intel confirms execution while in captivity The extremist Salafi organization Al-Mujahedeen ('Lords of the Wilderness') is the group that held Shiri Bibas and her two young children, Ariel and Kfir, after they were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Hamas-led October 7 attack. According to Israeli assessments, the group murdered them in captivity as early as November 2023. Al-Mujahedeen was founded at the start of the Second Intifada in 2001, breaking away from Fatah. It initially operated as a faction of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades before becoming an independent militant group. The organization follows a radical Salafi ideology, which seeks to return to what it considers the fundamental roots of Islam, advocating extreme measures to achieve its goals. The group was initially led by Omar Abu-Sharia, whom Israel attempted to eliminate in 2006. He succumbed to his injuries six months later. Over the years, Al-Mujahedeen has carried out numerous attacks and has positioned itself as a violent extremist faction within Gaza. Unlike Hamas, which governs the enclave, Al-Mujahedeen maintains a distinct identity, often aligning with global jihadist movements. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: During the ongoing war in Gaza, the organization claimed to have suffered significant losses, including key members of its leadership. In April 2023, it announced the deaths of several senior operatives, including the commander of its rocket unit in central Gaza, a senior figure in the Deir al-Balah battalion, and a member of its elite unit in the same area. After the October 7 attack, Hamas transferred some hostages to smaller armed factions, including Al-Mujahedeen. Shiri Bibas and her children were among those handed over. According to Israeli intelligence, they were held in Khan Younis before being murdered. The group falsely claimed that the Bibas family was killed in an Israeli airstrike, but IDF officials have confirmed that the children were brutally executed in captivity. Al-Mujahedeen's actions underscore the fragmentation of militant groups within Gaza and the brutality faced by hostages held by factions beyond Hamas itself. Israeli authorities continue to demand the return of Shiri Bibas' body, along with all remaining hostages. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hjtwd3hcjg	2025-02-20T23:36:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/18/Sk7kExKDkx/Sk7kExKDkx_0_76_1024_577_0_small.jpg

Snow expected in northern Israel, with the possibility of spreading to Jerusalem and Negev Highlands, but estimated to not be signifcant due to lack of rainfall Israel is bracing for the 'Coral' winter storm, set to bring with it a significant drop in temperatures and the possibility of snow in higher elevations. According to the Meteorological Service, local showers, mostly light, are expected on Friday from northern Israel to the northern Negev. Snow will fall on Mount Hermon, and light snowfall may occur in the highest peaks of northern Israel. Precipitation will be accompanied by unseasonally cold temperatures. On Saturday, intermittent rain is expected in northern and central Israel, with isolated thunderstorms possible, mainly in the north. Snow will continue on Mount Hermon, and light snowfall could occur in the highest peaks of the northern mountains. Strong winds are also expected, particularly in the south. At night, light snow may fall in the higher elevations of central Israel, including the Samaria and Judea regions, as well as the Negev Highlands, including Jerusalem. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sunday will be cloudy, with temperatures dropping even further. Light rain is expected, and there is a possibility of light snowfall in the mountains. The highest chance for snow in Jerusalem and the Negev Highlands will be late Sunday night into Monday morning. However, due to limited precipitation, only a thin accumulation is expected—perhaps 1 to 3 centimeters. Any snow that does settle is unlikely to cause road closures. Monday will remain particularly cold, with occasional light rain in some areas. Dr. Amir Givati, director of the Meteorological Service, stated, 'The cold wave is already on its way, and we will begin to feel the temperature drop on Saturday, with further declines on Sunday and Monday. This system is bringing heavy snowfall to neighboring Turkey and Greece, causing disruptions there. However, in Israel, it is primarily expected to bring extreme cold rather than significant snowfall. Any snow that does fall in the central mountains is unlikely to accumulate significantly.' From Saturday night into Sunday and throughout Sunday, the cold wave is expected to bring near-freezing temperatures in the mountains, with possible ice formation and frost, though no significant snowfall. According to the Meteorological Service forecast, temperatures on Sunday night into Monday are expected to drop sharply, reaching -8.2°C on Mount Hermon, -4.1°C in Merom Golan, -3.9°C in El Rom, -3.3°C on Mount Bental, -2.4°C in Kidah, and -2°C in Bar’am. Temperatures will be unseasonably cold across the country. In Jerusalem, temperatures will range from 5 to 10 degrees Celsius, while Tel Aviv will see a range of 11 to 16 degrees. Haifa will experience temperatures between 10 and 14 degrees, and Safed will drop to between 3 and 9 degrees. Katzrin will range from 5 to 12 degrees, and Tiberias from 13 to 17 degrees. In Nazareth, temperatures will be between 8 and 12 degrees, while Afula will range from 8 to 15 degrees. Beit She’an is expected to range from 9 to 17 degrees, Lod from 9 to 16, and Ashdod from 10 to 16. In Ein Gedi, temperatures will be between 12 and 18 degrees, while Beersheba will range from 7 to 13 degrees.

'We can say with certainty that they were murdered in a brutal manner, a fact supported by intelligence,' the IDF said.

Trump, Putin meeting depends on progress toward ending Ukraine wa...	US top diplomat says he discussed such meeting with Russian counterpart Lavrov in Saudi Arabia, telling him: 'There isn't going to be a meeting until we know what the meeting is going to be about' A possible meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin 'will largely depend on whether we can make any progress on ending the war in Ukraine,' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday. Rubio said he discussed such a meeting when he met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, telling Lavrov and Russian officials: 'There isn't going to be a meeting until we know what the meeting is going to be about.' 'I think when that meeting happens will largely depend on whether we can make any progress on ending the war in Ukraine,' Rubio told journalist Catherine Herridge in an interview broadcast on X. Following the talks in Saudi Arabia, Trump - who spoke on the phone with Putin last week - said on Tuesday that he would probably meet with Putin before the end of the month. Rubio said: 'I don't know the timing of it.' Rubio said Trump wants to know if Russia is serious about ending the war in Ukraine, triggered by Moscow's invasion of its neighbour three years ago. 'The only way is to test them, to basically engage them and say, 'Okay, are you serious about ending the war? And if so, what are your demands? Are your public demands and your private demands different?'' Rubio said. 'The only thing we agreed upon is that we're going to talk about peace. What they offer, what they're willing to concede to, what they're willing to consider, will determine whether they're serious about peace or not,' he said. 'We're just not at that stage yet.' Trump's bid to try and end the war left Ukraine and European allies concerned they would be cut out of any peace talks, but Rubio said the U.S. has consulted with all. Trump 'Very Upset' Rubio spoke amid a widening rift between Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Trump denounced Zelenskiy as 'a dictator without elections' on Wednesday after Zelenskiy said Trump was trapped in a Russian disinformation bubble, a response to the U.S. president suggesting Ukraine started the war. 'President Trump is very upset at President Zelenskiy,' Rubio said. 'We care about (Ukraine) because it has implications for our allies and ultimately to the world. There should be some level of gratitude here.' Washington is also pushing Kyiv to quickly negotiate a deal to open up Ukraine's natural wealth to U.S. investment. The United States has provided tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine during the war and Trump has said U.S. investment in Ukrainian minerals could ensure 'that we're going to in some form get this money back.' Rubio discussed a deal in a meeting with Zelenskiy and U.S. Vice President JD Vance in Munich last Friday. 'We explained to them, 'Look, we want to be in joint venture with you, not because we're trying to steal from your country, but because we think that's actually a security guarantee, because we're your partner in an important economic endeavor',' Rubio told Herridge. 'We get to get paid back some of the money ... and also now we have a vested interest in the security of Ukraine,' he said. 'And he said, 'Sure, we want to do this deal. It makes all the sense in the world. The only thing is, I need to run it through my legislative process. They have to approve it.' Rubio said he was upset to then see Zelenskiy saying he had rejected the deal, because 'that's not what happened.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjxjhqbckx	2025-02-20T21:33:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2020/05/07/9954785/9954785_0_125_1300_732_0_small.jpg
Israel: Failure to return Shiri Bibas - gross violation of cease-...	Despite breach, Jerusalem says next phase of hostage deal to continue as planned, with six living hostages to be released on Saturday Israel said Friday that Hamas had violated the hostage release agreement by failing to return Shiri Bibas. The Bibas family was informed that she was not among the four bodies transferred Thursday to Israel’s Institute of Forensic Medicine in Abu Kabir. 'The body of the woman was examined multiple times, with several cross-checks. It does not match the DNA of any hostage and was also found with clothing. Multiple experts reviewed the findings repeatedly,' the IDF said. Following the breach of the agreement, the IDF stressed, 'Our demand to Hamas is clear—return Shiri Bibas. This message is being conveyed directly to Hamas and will also be released publicly in English and Arabic.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The military confirmed that the identification of Kfir and Ariel Bibas was swift and conclusive. 'We can say with certainty that they were murdered in a brutal manner, a fact supported by intelligence,' the IDF said. Officials emphasized that Israel would make sure the world knows 'the baby and the child were murdered based on solid intelligence, not just forensic examination. Jund al-Sham, an extremist Salafi group, held the Bibas family, and their murder took place in November 2023.' The United States has been briefed on the findings, which Israel described as 'evidence of a horrific and brutal murder.' The IDF said the forensic identification process was thorough and included determining the causes of death. 'Oded Lifshitz was murdered, and so were Ariel and Kfir,' the statement said. Despite the violation, Israel said the next phase of the hostage release deal would continue as planned. Six living hostages to be released on Saturday and five bodies next week, Shiri Bibas not included. Israel’s Coordinator for Hostages and Missing Persons, Gal Hirsch, arrived at Kfar Maccabiah overnight with IDF officials to update the Bibas family. Later, he held an urgent call with Adam Boehler, the U.S. special envoy for hostage affairs, to brief him on the latest developments. Israel has sent urgent messages to mediators, demanding Hamas uphold the deal. 'We don’t know why they did this. This is a gross violation,' an Israeli official said. 'We are demanding her return. It is critical that Saturday’s exchange proceeds as scheduled.' Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon condemned Hamas’ actions, saying, 'Hamas not only murdered Ariel and Kfir Bibas in cold blood—a four-year-old child and a ten-month-old baby—but continues to violate every basic moral principle even after their deaths. There are no words to describe such horror.' 'Instead of returning Shiri, Hamas sent an anonymous body, as if it were a worthless shipment,' Danon said. 'This is a new level of evil—unmatched cruelty.' He called on the UN Secretary-General, the Security Council, and the General Assembly to 'break their silence in the face of Hamas’ brutality.' Israel, he said, 'demands a clear and unequivocal condemnation of this heinous crime and an urgent call for Shiri’s return to her family. History will remember who stood by in silence while Hamas trampled on human dignity.' As part of the next phase of the deal, six living hostages are expected to be freed Saturday. They include Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, along with four hostages classified as ill or wounded—Omer Wenkert, Elia Cohen, Tal Shahem, and Omer Shem Tov. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjgqicbcke	2025-02-20T21:13:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/20/SJl00DMAE5ke/SJl00DMAE5ke_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

A possible meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin 'will largely depend on whether we can make any progress on ending the war in Ukraine,' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday. Rubio said he discussed such a meeting when he met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, telling Lavrov and Russian officials: 'There isn't going to be a meeting until we know what the meeting is going to be about.' 'I think when that meeting happens will largely depend on whether we can make any progress on ending the war in Ukraine,' Rubio told journalist Catherine Herridge in an interview broadcast on X. Following the talks in Saudi Arabia, Trump - who spoke on the phone with Putin last week - said on Tuesday that he would probably meet with Putin before the end of the month.

Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, strongly condemned on Friday the killing of Kfir and Ariel Bibas and the failure to return the body of their mother, Shiri, while criticizing the UN’s response. 'There are no words to describe such horror. Hamas not only murdered Ariel and Kfir Bibas in cold blood—a four-year-old boy and a 10-month-old baby—but continues to trample on every basic moral value even after their deaths. Instead of returning Shiri, Hamas sends an anonymous body as if it were a worthless shipment. This is a new peak of evil, an unprecedented level of cruelty.

Hamas indoctrination is 'atrocious,' says expert as hostages are ...	Ruth Wasserman-Lande: 'They are manipulating and quite literally kidnapping their own population' The level of Hamas indoctrination throughout the Gaza Strip is 'atrocious,' according to Ruth Wasserman-Lande, a senior fellow at the Misgav Institute. 'They are manipulating and quite literally kidnapping their own population for over 16 years already in order to indoctrinate them and incite them in mosques, in cultural centers, in the media, in every aspect of human life, of course, including the curriculum and the educational system,' Wasserman-Lande told ILTV News on Thursday, as crowds—including children—gathered in Khan Yunis to watch the release of four Israeli hostages. Hamas released Kfir and Ariel Bibas and Oded Lifschitz. It also returned a woman’s body, which was supposed to be that of the Bibas children's mother, Shiri Bibas. However, a forensic evaluation revealed that Hamas had sent a different body instead. 'All of this was done throughout the years with the help and the aid of foreign money that was funded and channeled through Hamas and through UNRWA,' Wasserman-Lande continued, explaining how Hamas was able to indoctrinate its population. 'These [Gazan] kids that are watching this absolutely preposterous theater of manipulation and cynicism—they're learning to kill, they're learning to murder babies, they're learning to really abuse human lives. 'And I cannot but wonder who, in their right mind, can justify any of this horrific human behavior,' Wasserman-Lande concluded.

Syrian Jews revisit Damascus after Assad’s fall	Inside the last remaining synagogue in Damascus, Rabbi Joseph Hamra and his son Henry read from a Torah scroll When President Bashar al-Assad was overthrown in December, the Hamra family began organizing a visit to Damascus—something that had once seemed unimaginable. With assistance from the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a U.S.-based advocacy group, they set out to reconnect with their roots. During their visit, they met with Syria’s deputy foreign minister at the ministry, now overseen by caretaker authorities appointed by the Islamist rebels who ended more than 50 years of Assad family rule. The new leadership has pledged that all of Syria’s communities will have a role in shaping the country’s future. Inside the last remaining synagogue in Damascus, Rabbi Joseph Hamra and his son Henry read from a Torah scroll, reliving a piece of Syria’s lost Jewish history. Once home to thousands, the Jewish community in Damascus now numbers fewer than ten. 'I want to see my kids come back and see this beautiful synagogue. It’s a work of art,' said Henry Hamra, son of Rabbi Joseph Hamra. But much of that history has been erased. The ancient Jobar Synagogue—believed to have been built in honor of the prophet Elijah—was looted and reduced to rubble during Syria’s civil war. 'We need the government’s security, and it's going to happen. We spoke to the foreign minister yesterday, and he promised us that it's going to be his priority,' Hamra said. The delegation met with Syria’s new leadership, who pledged to protect Jewish heritage. But as the country reshapes its future, questions remain: Will Syria’s Jewish past truly be safeguarded? And could this visit signal the beginning of something new? For now, it remains a return to the past—one filled with hopes for what the future might bring.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkfvycscyx	2025-02-20T20:37:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/21/S1DJWcS9kl/S1DJWcS9kl_0_41_680_383_0_small.jpg
Why Did Netanyahu not take Trump up on his offer to have 'all hel...	Ruthie Blum: 'Anyone who suggests that Netanyahu only cares about his coalition and keeping his seat and doesn't care about the hostages is being immoral' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not take U.S. President Donald Trump up on his offer to return to war but instead secured the release of three hostages from Gaza last week. He made this choice because he was 'stuck between a rock and a hard place,' according to Ruthie Blum, senior contributing editor for JNS. Blum explained that had Netanyahu refused the three hostages and sent the army back into Gaza to 'blitz the crap out of everybody,' Hamas would not have returned any captives. He would then have been blamed for endangering lives he could have saved. 'Anyone who suggests that Netanyahu only cares about his coalition and keeping his seat and doesn't care about the hostages, I think, is being immoral because that isn't true,' Blum said during ILTV’s Insider earlier this week. 'He's actually trying to satisfy as much of the Israeli public as he can, and that is an impossible task.'

Should Israel Consider a Nuclear Strike on Iran? Will Trump’s Return Rewrite Middle East History? On Thursday, Hamas returned the bodies of four hostages to Israel. However, DNA tests confirmed only three of them: Kfir and Ariel Bibas, who were found to have been brutally murdered in captivity, and Oded Lifshitz. The body of Shiri Bibas, Kfir and Ariel’s mother, did not match the expected DNA. The IDF condemned the act, stating, 'This is a very serious violation by the terrorist organization Hamas, which is required by the agreement to return four dead hostages. We demand that Hamas return Shiri home along with all of our hostages.' Another six hostages are expected to be released on Saturday, including two who have been held since 2014 and 2015: Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed. The other four—Tal Shoham, Omer Shem-Tov, Omer Wenkert, and Eliya Cohen—were kidnapped on October 7.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjoz5ksqyg	2025-02-20T20:16:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/10/BkKUHcDYJe/BkKUHcDYJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Israel bolsters West Bank troop presence after bus bombings; Neta...	The IDF announced early Friday that it is deploying three additional battalions to the West Bank, following a series of coordinated bus bombings in the Tel Aviv area. The decision, made by IDF Central Command, comes amid heightened security concerns after multiple explosive devices detonated on Israeli buses Thursday night. While no casualties were reported, the incidents have been linked to Palestinian terrorist groups. 'The IDF continues to conduct ongoing assessments and is prepared to expand offensive operations. Counterterrorism operations in northern Samaria are ongoing,' the military said in a statement. 'The IDF will continue to operate both defensively and offensively to ensure the security of Israeli civilians.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered security forces to 'carry out an intensified operation against terror strongholds,' though details of the planned response have not been disclosed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by3kirr9kg	2025-02-20T15:39:53-08:00	
Report: Egypt to present alternative Gaza plan, aiming to counter...	Proposal includes 10-year reconstruction plan, population redistribution, international oversight of weapons and eventual Palestinian statehood; alternative to Trump’s controversial displacement proposal to be discussed at upcoming summits in Riyadh, Cairo Egypt is advancing a two-stage plan for the Gaza Strip, which it aims to present to U.S. President Donald Trump after gaining approval at upcoming summits in Riyadh and Cairo, the Qatari newspaper The New Arab reported Thursday, citing Egyptian diplomatic sources in Washington and Arab League officials. The Egyptian initiative is reportedly designed as a practical alternative to Trump's controversial proposal, which includes the relocation of Gaza’s 2 million residents. An Egyptian diplomat in Washington detailed the first stage of the plan, which is expected to last 10 years and focus on reconstruction, development and infrastructure projects, while preparing for a broader long-term solution to the Palestinian issue. The plan envisions a redistribution of residential areas, reducing population density in northern Gaza and establishing low-population 'safe zones' near Israeli border communities. The proposal also includes restrictions on Palestinian armed factions, aiming to monitor but not completely disarm them. According to sources, Egypt proposes designated weapons storage sites in Gaza, to be overseen by European and Egyptian monitors. To manage local security and governance disputes, Egypt intends to establish an Arab-led committee, which would function as an extension of the existing Egyptian-Qatari committee overseeing the return of displaced Gazans to the north. Additionally, the continued operation of an American security firm currently active in the area is envisioned, though limited to three key contact points between Gaza and Israel. The second stage of the plan would move toward establishing a Palestinian state, with discussions on connecting Gaza, the West Bank and Jerusalem. According to an Arab diplomat, a Gulf state recently consulted Israeli and American officials about the plan, expressing concern that Egypt's refusal to encourage Gaza’s depopulation could entrench armed resistance and jeopardize long-term investment efforts. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israeli officials have also reportedly voiced opposition to the plan’s exclusion of Israeli oversight in Gaza's reconstruction, fearing it could facilitate a resurgence of Hamas’ military strength. Sources cited by The New Arab said the primary obstacle to implementing the Egyptian plan is Israel’s insistence on supervising Gaza’s reconstruction, amid security concerns. Egypt’s plan reportedly calls for construction materials to enter Gaza through Rafah instead of Kerem Shalom, with Egyptian firms playing a central role in rebuilding efforts. To push the plan forward, Egypt is seeking Arab backing to pressure the U.S. into influencing Israel's position. Discussions on the matter are expected to take place at the Riyadh summit on Friday, while Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has reportedly raised the issue in talks with Western and Arab leaders. Meanwhile, reports indicate that Arab states are developing a $20 billion counterproposal to Trump’s Gaza evacuation plan. At a recent investment conference in Miami, Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff defended Trump’s plan, clarifying that the relocation of Gaza’s residents was meant to provoke discussion rather than promote forced displacement. He added that Gaza's reconstruction would require a complete redesign and could take more than five years. Arab leaders are expected to present their own alternative framework at a Cairo summit in early March, offering an investment-driven approach to stabilizing and rebuilding Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk0keqscjx	2025-02-20T15:32:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/12/H19xR4qKyl/H19xR4qKyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Quick-thinking passenger prevents mass casualties in coordinated ...	Vigilant passenger helps avert potential tragedy in one of Bat Yam bus explosions; spotting suspicious bag in back seat, she alerts driver, who immediately drove to terminal and called police; moments later, device detonated, but by sheer luck, bus already empty A vigilant passenger in Bat Yam helped prevent a potential mass-casualty attack Thursday night when she spotted a suspicious bag on a public bus and alerted the driver—just minutes before an explosive device detonated inside the empty vehicle. The driver, acting swiftly on the warning, diverted the bus to a terminal, called police, and evacuated the area. Shortly after, a powerful blast tore through the bus, but no one was hurt. The explosion was part of a coordinated and premeditated attack targeting three buses in different locations. Officials confirmed that improvised explosive devices (IEDs), each weighing around 5 kilograms (11 pounds), had been placed on multiple buses. The explosives were marked with the phrase 'Revenge for Tulkarm.' A Hamas-linked group in the West Bank later hinted at responsibility. Dan Bus Company CEO Ofir Karni praised the passenger’s awareness and the driver’s decisive actions, saying they had prevented a catastrophic loss of life. 'This was a well-organized attack across multiple locations,' Karni said. 'Fortunately, in two other cases, security teams discovered and neutralized the devices before they could go off.' Shmuel Malka, a first responder from United Hatzalah, arrived at the scene of the first blast on Menachem Begin Street: 'I saw a bus with its rear section blown apart. We started searching for casualties, but thankfully, the vehicle had already been emptied. Just as we finished, another explosion hit Ha’amal Street, and then a third bus exploded nearby within minutes.' Eran Carmel, a paramedic with Magen David Adom’s emergency motorcycle unit, called it a miracle that no one was injured. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We were searching the first blast site when we heard another explosion and rushed over. Then a third bus blew up. We’re staying on high alert for any further threats.' Following the attacks, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was briefed and held an emergency security assessment. Transportation Minister Miri Regev ordered a temporary halt to all public transportation nationwide for safety inspections. Police urged the public to remain alert and report suspicious objects as the investigation continues. Police Commissioner Dani Levy visited one of the blast sites to oversee the response. A senior Tel Aviv police official said the devices were timer-based and resembled those commonly used in the West Bank. Israeli Railways also increased security at overnight parking lots, and heightened security measures were enacted across the country. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkw1ehb51g	2025-02-20T15:17:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/20/H1kkqfHqyl/H1kkqfHqyl_272_204_2615_1472_0_small.jpg

Military says Ariel Bibas, 4, and Kfir Bibas, 10 months, murdered in captivity in November 2023 after forensic identification of their remains; terror group violates agreement by failing to return their mother, Shiri Bibas, whose whereabouts remain unknown The IDF officially confirmed early Friday the deaths of Ariel Bibas, 4, and Kfir Bibas, 10 months, who were taken hostage by Hamas on October 7, following forensic identification of their remains. According to the military, forensic experts at the National Center of Forensic Medicine, in coordination with the Israel Police, completed the identification process. Intelligence assessments and forensic evidence indicate that Ariel and Kfir were 'brutally murdered by terrorists in captivity in November 2023.' The third body returned by Hamas as part of the latest hostage deal does not belong to Shiri Bibas, their mother, nor any other known hostage.

Sabrina Ajmechet's criticism follows images of Hamas and other terrorist groups staging a 'ceremony' for hostage bodies before their transfer to Israel Argentine lawmaker Sabrina Ajmechet on Thursday criticized human rights organizations for their lack of response to images showing Hamas and other terrorist groups staging a 'ceremony' before transferring the bodies of four murdered hostages to Israel. Photos from Gaza earlier in the day showed armed terrorists carrying coffins they claimed contained the remains of Kfir and Ariel Bibas—both Argentine citizens—before handing them over to Israeli authorities. '‘Date of arrest: 07/10/2023’—this is what these evildoers wrote on the coffins,' Ajmechet, who chairs Argentina’s Human Rights Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, wrote on X. 'This was not an arrest: they were kidnapped. They were torn from their homes and returned in coffins.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Drawing a parallel to Argentina’s history of forced disappearances under military rule, Ajmechet condemned what she described as a double standard. 'We are a country with a painful history, where babies were taken alive from their mothers—never to be heard from again. Human rights organizations have dedicated decades to these cases. And today, those same institutions and individuals are silent. Or worse—they defend the murderers of Kfir and Ariel, turning the attackers into victims.' Ajmechet also questioned the broader public’s response. 'I cannot understand the silence of most Argentines in the face of what is happening. I do not want to think it is because these babies were Jewish. I would like to understand why they remain silent in the face of such barbarism, such inhuman cruelty.' Earlier Thursday, Argentine President Javier Milei announced a national day of mourning after Hamas confirmed the deaths of the Bibas mother and children. Milei also shared images of the Bibas family, emphasizing their Argentine citizenship. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkk4b11hckg	2025-02-20T12:44:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/06/Hkf6tPJPw0/Hkf6tPJPw0_0_65_768_433_0_small.jpg

Putin thanks Hamas for release of Russian Israeli hostage, ignore...	Russian president praises terror group for releasing Sasha Troufanov but sidesteps return of 4 Israeli hostages' bodies; Israeli officials condemns Russian media for falsely blaming Israel for their deaths Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday praised Hamas for the release of Russian-Israeli hostage Alexander 'Sasha' Troufanov but made no mention of the bodies of four Israeli hostages, including a mother and her two young children, who were returned to Israel earlier in the day. During a meeting at the Kremlin with Russia’s Chief Rabbi Berel Lazar, Putin said he wished to send 'best regards to Alexander Troufanov and his loved ones on his release from captivity.' He credited the development to Russia’s 'consistent policy in ensuring Middle East stability, which has earned the trust of many partners in the region.' Putin went on to thank Hamas leaders, saying, 'I know the efforts were not easy, but he and his family endured this period. Thank God he is home, surrounded by his loved ones.' His remarks were in stark contrast to Russian state media’s coverage of the return of four Israeli hostage bodies earlier in the day. The Russian television network RT posted on social media that 'Hamas carried four coffins, including those of small children, who were killed by war criminal Netanyahu.' Another report by RT described Hamas gunmen at the transfer as 'resistance fighters carrying weapons in Gaza.' The Israeli Embassy in Moscow issued a sharp rebuke, condemning the reports as 'not only entirely unprofessional but also deeply antisemitic and malicious.' The embassy called on RT to 'immediately correct the damage to its credibility.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The broadcaster later removed to posts. 'We have deleted two posts from earlier today, concerning the hostage handover in Gaza,' it wrote on X. 'While we do not shy away from difficult subjects, these posts misrepresented the events in question. We remain committed to unflinching but fair coverage of the conflict.' Israeli Ambassador to Russia Simona Halperin commended RT for its decision. 'On this sad day for us in Israel, I appreciate the decision of @RT to do the right thing - correct what needed to be corrected, a horrible misrepresentation of the brutal yet another Hamas demonstrations of cruelty, and uphold its role as a media outlet. [A]appreciated,' she wrote. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, Russian state media—largely under government control—has repeatedly accused Israel of war crimes while aligning itself with Palestinian factions, including Hamas. Moscow’s stance comes despite years of Israel maintaining a careful diplomatic balance with Russia under Netanyahu, refraining from criticism even amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Analysts have pointed to Israel’s past efforts to preserve coordination with Russia, particularly regarding Israeli airstrikes targeting Iranian weapons shipments in Syria. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkfjjgb91g	2025-02-20T12:29:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/20/BJGJQxScyx/BJGJQxScyx_0_91_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Authorities report no casualties in both incidents as police and Shin Bet investigate; one explosion sparks fire, quickly contained by firefighters Two explosions rocked bus depots in the central city of Bat Yam on Thursday evening in what authorities suspect was a failed terror attack. No casualties were reported, and both incidents are under investigation by Israeli police and the Shin Bet security agency. Police spokesperson Aryeh Doron said that all possible leads are being investigated and emphasized the importance of public vigilance. The first blast occurred at a bus parking lot near the city's stadium, followed by a second explosion at another nearby lot. A security guard at the scene reported the initial explosion at 8:30 p.m., after which a bus caught fire. Firefighters quickly brought the flames under control, and bomb disposal experts were called to determine the cause of the blasts.

Vance to hostage families: 'Trump's going to fight every single d...	You need a president who is able to pick up the phone and say: ‘You’ve got to bring these people home,' US VP tells CPAC; Witkoff says president's Gaza plan not about evicting Palestinians, but create better future for them U.S. Vice President JD Vance told to the families of the hostage held in Gaza on Thursday that President Donald Trump will 'fight every single day' to bring their loved ones back. 'Our message to the hostages is that President Trump loves you, he hasn’t forgotten your loved ones and he’s going to fight every single day to bring them home. That is exactly what he has been doing, and that’s what he’ll keep on doing,' Vance told the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington, DC, which had several relatives of hostages in attendance. 'It’s just a question of leadership. You need a president who is able to pick up the phone and say: ‘You’ve got to bring these people home. No, no no no. We’re not focused on that crap right now. We’re focused on bringing hostages home.’ 'And then, when negotiations hit a wall because they always do, you need a president who gets on the phone and says: ‘Cut this crap out. You’ve got to make progress. You’ve got to keep that pace going.’ It’s leadership. I saw it behind the scenes.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Vance also acknowledged the crucial role Trump's Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff played in the latest rounds of negotiations. 'What the president did was empower… his dear friend Steve Witkoff as an emissary of the United States,' he said. 'He said: ‘Steve, you speak for me. Get it done. And if there are problems, call me.’ Steve Witkoff, with the president’s leadership, got it done.' Earlier today Witkoff said that Trump's plan for Gaza was not about evicting Palestinians, and the conversation about Gaza's future was being shifted towards how to create a better future for Palestinians. Trump proposed on February 4 that the U.S. should take over Gaza, with Palestinians resettled in other places including Egypt and Jordan, a suggestion that caused an international outcry. However, speaking at a Miami conference hosted by a non-profit linked to the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund, Witkoff said that Trump's comments on Gaza were more about trying different solutions to those proposed over the previous 50 years. He said that the war between Israel and Hamas has left much of Gaza destroyed and littered with unexploded ordnance, and it was impossible to see how people could return. 'It's going to take a lot of clean-up and imagination, and a great master plan, and that doesn't mean we're on an eviction plan, when the President talks about this,' Witkoff told the FII Institute event. 'It means he wants to shake up everyone's thinking, and think about what is compelling and what is the best solution for the Palestinian people. 'For instance, do they want to live in a home there, or would they rather have an opportunity to resettle in some sort of better place, to have jobs, upside and financial prospects,' he added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk8szeh91e	2025-02-20T10:07:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/Bkx00IGOTFJe/Bkx00IGOTFJe_1_14_800_451_0_small.jpg

The Russian president noted that efforts to secure Tropunov’s release 'were not easy' and added, 'Thank God he is home, surrounded by his loved ones.'

UN envoy says inclusive Syrian government could help lift sanctio...	Geir Pedersen says remains concerned over Israel's presence in on Syrian Hermon; 'The solution is very simple: the Israelis need to withdraw' Creating an inclusive government in Syria in the coming weeks will help determine whether Western sanctions are lifted as the country rebuilds after the ouster of former President Bashar Assad, the UN special envoy to Syria said Thursday. 'What I’m hoping is that with a truly new inclusive government in place on the 1st of March, this will help us in lifting sanctions' imposed on Syria by Western countries during Assad’s rule, Geir Pedersen told The Associated Press in an interview during a visit to Damascus. After Assad was toppled in a lightning rebel offensive in December, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the main former rebel group now in control of Syria, set up an interim administration comprising mainly members of its 'salvation government' that had ruled in northwestern Syria. The country’s de facto authorities said at the time that a new government would be formed through an inclusive process by March. In January, former HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa was named Syria’s interim president after a meeting of most of the country’s former rebel factions. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In recent weeks, a committee has been holding meetings in different parts of Syria in preparation for a national dialogue conference to chart the country’s political future, the date of which has not yet been announced. Pedersen said that in his first meeting with al-Sharaa in December, al-Sharaa had insisted that the interim government would rule for only three months, although Pedersen warned him the timeline was tight. 'I think the important thing is not whether it is three months or not, but it is whether they will deliver on what they have said all along, that this is going to be an inclusive process where all Syrians will be included,' Pedersen said. The U.S. and European countries have not lifted sanctions that were imposed on the Syrian government under Assad’s rule, which the new authorities have said is handicapping their ability to rebuild the country after nearly 14 years of civil war and restore essential services like state electricity. Officials from some Western countries have said they want to see if the interim rulers will follow through on their promises of inclusive governance and protecting minorities. Organizers of the national dialogue have said the conference will include all segments of Syrian society except for Assad loyalists and the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led force in the northeast that has so far refused to dissolve and be absorbed into the new national army. The SDF is currently in negotiations with the central government, and Pedersen said he hopes to see a 'political solution' to the impasse. Pedersen said he is also concerned about a security vacuum following the disbanding of the former national army and security services by the country’s new rulers. 'It’s very important that the new structures of the state are coming in place quickly and that there is an offer to those who are no longer in service of the army or the security services, that there are other job opportunities and that people do not feel that they are excluded from the future of Syria,' he said. The UN envoy said he also remains concerned about Israel’s incursions into Syrian territory since the fall of Assad. The IDF has seized a UN-patrolled buffer zone in the Golan Heights established by a 1974 cease-fire agreement with Syria and has also made forays beyond the buffer zone. The UN has said that Israel is violating the agreement. Israeli officials have said they took the action to protect Israel’s security and that their presence would be temporary. Pedersen said the security concerns are being addressed and 'there is really, in my opinion, no argument for why the Israelis should be staying.' 'The solution is very simple. The Israelis need to withdraw,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hktntre5yx	2025-02-20T09:33:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/17/SyXt4l1HJg/SyXt4l1HJg_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Father of Tanzanian student killed by Hamas honors son with Hebre...	Clemence Mtenga, 22-year-old Tanzanian agricultural student, murdered by terrorists at Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7, just weeks after arriving in Israel for training program; Hebrew verse from Book of Deuteronomy inscribed on his gravestone in his home village In a small village in the Rombo region of Tanzania, near the Kenyan border, Felix Mtenga made a heartfelt request to members of the Imagine Israel Africa association: to choose a Hebrew phrase to inscribe on the gravestone of his late son, Clemence Mtenga. Clemence, just 22 years old, was brutally murdered outside his room at Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7, only three weeks after arriving in Israel. He had come to study agriculture as part of a program aimed at improving his family’s financial situation. Clemence was one of 260 Tanzanian students participating in an agricultural training initiative as part of a cooperation program between Israel and Tanzania. The association fulfilled the grieving father’s request, selecting a verse from the Book of Deuteronomy: 'When you besiege a city for a long time, making war against it in order to capture it, you shall not destroy its [fruit-bearing] trees by swinging an axe against them; for you may eat from them, and you shall not cut them down. For is the tree of the field a man, that it should be besieged (destroyed) by you?' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On that fateful Saturday—his day off—Clemence chose to remain at the kibbutz. Initially feared to have been taken hostage, his body was later found outside his room and identified 41 days later through DNA testing. Liraz Madar, a board member of the association and coordinator of delegations to Tanzania, visited the bereaved family. 'The family received us warmly, with immense respect and gratitude,' she wrote in an emotional Facebook post. 'The father is a hardworking man who raised successful, educated children.' Honoring Clemence’s legacy The association has committed to supporting the Mtenga family, who are now receiving a victims-of-terror stipend from the State of Israel, and to memorializing Clemence in his home village and the schools supported by the association. 'We promised to establish an excellence fund in his name so that every delegation promoting excellence in various fields will award prizes to two outstanding students,' Madar explained. As early as October, two seventh-grade students received a mathematics excellence scholarship in Clemence’s memory, and two more students are expected to receive the scholarship in April. 'The phrase inscribed on the gravestone comes from the Book of Deuteronomy,' Madar elaborated. 'One interpretation is that it is forbidden to harm an innocent person, just as it is forbidden to harm a tree that bears fruit and is not part of the conflict.' A father’s faith Clemence’s father, a devout Christian, shared a moving perspective: for his family, Clemence has returned to his ancestors in Israel, and they believe his death in Israel was no coincidence. Recently, Felix, who now works as a welder for the association, sent a photo of the gravestone with the Hebrew inscription prominently displayed. 'The verse from Deuteronomy 20:19-20 reminds us of the sanctity of life,' Madar emphasized. 'It highlights the principle that one must not harm the innocent, just as one must not harm a tree that is uninvolved in the conflict.' 'I cannot explain the odds that, out of 65 million people, the student who was killed happened to be the son of a man known to our association, in a village where we volunteer,' Madar reflected. 'The pain of October 7 transcends continents and religions. I hope this tragedy will come to an end, that the hostages will return, the war will cease, and we will find a way to heal and grow from what remains.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hkwwn6nq1x	2025-02-20T09:27:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/18/rkXFBGLEa/rkXFBGLEa_0_126_400_226_0_small.jpg

After Oded Lifshitz’s body identified, process continues for three others—whom Hamas claims are Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas; hundreds of Israelis gather near forensic institute, holding orange balloons, Israeli flags and 'Sorry' signs The National Center for Forensic Medicine is set to make an official announcement Thursday evening regarding the identification of three of the four bodies transferred from Hamas custody. Earlier in the day, the family of 85-year-old Oded Lifshitz confirmed his identification, while the Bibas family anxiously awaits confirmation on whether the other remains belong to Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, as Hamas has claimed. Hundreds of Israelis gathered along the roads without any formal call to do so, lining the route taken by the convoy carrying the hostages' remains from Gaza to the forensic center in Tel Aviv. Silent and solemn, they held Israeli flags, orange balloons symbolizing the red-haired Bibas children, and signs reading 'Forgive us.' Elderly women recited Psalms, teenagers stood with tear-streaked faces and a man clutching a balloon watched in silence. Political debates and media controversies surrounding the hostage deal were absent in the quiet crowd. As the procession passed, a man shouted, 'Wherever the convoy goes, the rain starts. The heavens are crying, believe me, the heavens are crying.' Dark clouds rolled in, muting the colors of the balloons and ribbons tied to trees in a symbolic moment. 'We came to pay our final respects to the babies murdered by these monsters. We couldn’t stay home,' said Uri, one of the mourners. Another attendee, Nava, expressed her anguish: 'I came to ask for forgiveness. This is the least we can do. My family lives in Nahal Oz; by chance, they survived. I feel terrible.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Many spoke of an overwhelming sense of duty, explaining that they could not go about their daily routines on such a day. 'A colleague called me from work, and I couldn't understand how he could even sit at his computer,' said Nirit from Tel Aviv. Eli and Anat from Rishon Lezion added, 'The entire country should be here today. This is a national day of mourning. Everything should have been shut down.' As the convoy reached its destination, a heavy silence filled the air. 'We abandoned those babies. It’s unbearable. We left them for over 500 days,' said Osnat, struggling to hold back tears. Others recounted how they had been watching the news at home but felt compelled to come in person. 'We couldn’t just sit there anymore,' said Eli. 'We had to be part of this moment.' Then, as the vehicles carrying the hostages' remains approached, the mourners broke into an impromptu rendition of Israel’s national anthem, Hatikvah. 'The hope of two thousand years,' they sang, their voices raw with emotion, their eyes red with grief. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1t5yys9ke	2025-02-20T08:16:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/20/BJZR8ZiV9Jx/BJZR8ZiV9Jx_0_49_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Oded Lifshitz - A man of peace and of the land	The 85-year-old grandfather and great-grandfather, who died in Gaza captivity after he was abducted on October 7, was one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz After over 500 days in Gaza captivity, the family of Oded Lifshitz said in a statement on Thursday that the body of their father and grandfather, who was returned to Israel this morning from the Gaza Strip, has been positively identified at the Institute for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv. '503 agonizing days of uncertainty have come to an end,' the family said. 'We had hoped and prayed so much that our end would be different. Now we can mourn the husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather we have been missing since October 7. Rebuilding our family will begin now and will not end until the last hostage is returned.' The Hostages, Missing Persons and Returnees Directorate of the Prime Minister's Office extended condolences to the Lifshitz family, stating, 'We bow our heads and send our sympathies; we will continue to support the family. We pray for the swift return of all hostages.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: German Ambassador to Israel Steffen Seibert paid tribute to Lifshitz, saying, 'This is heartbreaking—Oded Lifshitz, a man of peace and reconciliation with the Palestinians, a German citizen, was kidnapped and murdered by Hamas. As he returns home, my heart is with his family. May the memory of this gentle man and his life be a blessing.' Lifshitz, 85, was one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz and had ten grandchildren and one great-grandchild. He was abducted from his home along with his wife, Yocheved Lifshitz, who was later released in a hostage deal in November 2023. Yocheved recounted that on the morning of the October 7 massacre, Oded tried to close the door to their safe room, but the attackers shot him in the hand. She was taken away on a motorbike while Oded lay unconscious and bleeding at their doorstep. It was later revealed that the captors dressed him in a galabiya and held him for 20 days with fellow hostage Hanna Katzir, who was also later freed. Oded and Yocheved Lifshitz created a renowned cactus garden in Nir Oz. Their grandson, Daniel, said, 'My grandfather came to Nir Oz in 1956. The kibbutz was the life’s work of both him and my grandmother.' Oded was also a longtime peace activist who transported Palestinian cancer patients from Gaza to receive treatment in Israeli hospitals. His son, Yizhar, said this week that his father 'ended his life in a tragic, humiliating, and degrading way—unworthy and disgraceful. This was the fate of so many in Kibbutz Nir Oz. His home was burned, his wife was kidnapped and beaten before his eyes. Horrific. He was left without family, without children, without closure.' Describing the tragedy experienced by many families, he said, 'Hostages lived through an entire existence in there without us, under terrible conditions, and that void will always remain.' He also spoke of the painful sense of loss: 'When some come back alive and others don’t, you feel the missed chance. But I don't compare myself to parents who lost children—my father was 84 when he was kidnapped. He had grandchildren; he lived a full life.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/skbpkp49yg	2025-02-20T07:21:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/20/B19I00pV5yg/B19I00pV5yg_0_371_591_333_0_small.jpg

Israel, UN slam Hamas for 'abhorrent' display of hostage remains	Israel protests to mediators and Red Cross over 'sickening ceremony,' which it says violated prior agreements; UN human rights chief also condemns act The United Nations and Israeli officials condemned Hamas on Thursday after the terror group publicly displayed the bodies of four Israeli hostages before handing them over to the Red Cross. UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk called the act 'abhorrent' and a violation of international law. 'Under international law, any handover of remains must comply with the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, ensuring respect for the dignity of the deceased and their families,' Türk said in a statement. The hostages, including Israeli infant Kfir Bibas, his 4-year-old brother Ariel, their mother Shiri Bibas and 85-year-old Oded Lifshitz, were transferred to Israel on Thursday as part of the cease-fire agreement reached last month.

Israel confirms remains of hostage Oded Lifshitz identified as fa...	Forensic teams begin identification after thousands gather to honor convoy carrying 4 hostages’ remains; 85-year-old's family confirms his identity, mourning the loss; Hamas claims other victims are Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas The remains of Oded Lifshitz, 85, have been officially identified at the National Center for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv, his family confirmed Thursday, hours after his remains were returned to Israel from the Gaza Strip. 'After 503 agonizing days of uncertainty, we have received the devastating news,' the family said in a statement. 'We had hoped and prayed for a different outcome. Now, we can finally mourn our husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather, whom we have missed since October 7. Our family’s healing begins now and will not be complete until the last hostage is brought home.' Earlier Thursday, the bodies of four hostages—Lifshitz, along with Shiri, Kfir and Ariel Bibas, according to Hamas—were transferred to Israel from the Gaza Strip. Their remains were delivered in a Red Cross convoy and received by Israeli forces, including members of the IDF’s 50th Battalion and Chief Military Rabbi Brig. Gen. Eyal Krim, in a brief military ceremony. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the nation following the announcement, saying: 'My dear brothers and sisters, citizens of Israel, today we are all united in unbearable grief. Every home in Israel bows its head in sorrow. We mourn the terrible loss of our four hostages, and we all share in a pain that is mixed with rage. We are all outraged at the monsters of Hamas.' Netanyahu vowed that the tragedy reinforced Israel’s commitment to ensuring such atrocities never happen again. 'The blood of our loved ones cries out to us from the earth. It demands that we hold these vile murderers accountable—and we will. Our hearts are broken, but our spirit remains unshaken. With this resolve, we will bring all our hostages home, eliminate the murderers, destroy Hamas and—God willing—secure our future.' Defense Minister Israel Katz also offered condolences while warning Hamas of its fate. 'The heart of the entire nation mourns today. Hamas kidnapped, Hamas murdered and Hamas will be destroyed. We will avenge our enemies and secure our future.' The Hostages and Missing Persons Directorate also expressed condolences to the Lifshitz family, pledging continued support. 'We bow our heads in sorrow and send our deepest sympathies to the family. We will continue to stand by them through these difficult moments and pray for the swift return of all the hostages.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Thousands of Israelis lined the roads to honor the convoy, waving national flags, while crowds gathered outside the forensic institute in Tel Aviv, singing Israel’s national anthem, Hatikvah. Health Minister Uriel Buso said forensic teams would work diligently to confirm the victims’ identities and determine their causes of death, a process that 'may take time.' DNA samples had been collected from families early in the war to assist in identification, and forensic experts will use additional imaging, microscopic analysis and autopsies where necessary. 'The goal is to provide definitive identification and, where possible, information about how they died,' said Dr. Chen Kugel, head of the forensic institute. He noted that prolonged captivity complicates such determinations but pledged to do 'everything possible to provide clarity for the families.' The transfer of the bodies was marred by controversy, with Israeli officials condemning Hamas for what they described as a 'cruel and grotesque spectacle' during the handover, which was also denounced by the United Nations. Israel has formally protested the incident to mediating nations and the Red Cross, accusing Hamas of violating prior agreements. The Prime Minister’s Office confirmed the arrival of the bodies and urged the public to respect the privacy of the grieving families. 'This is a painful moment. We ask the public to avoid spreading unverified information and rely only on official updates,' the statement read. The Israeli public, deeply shaken by the hostage crisis, continues to rally for the return of those still held in Gaza. 'All the hostages must come home,' the Lifshitz family emphasized. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyyzdnv5yl	2025-02-20T05:36:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/20/SybX43NcJx/SybX43NcJx_133_14_561_316_0_small.jpg

Rescued hostage Luis Harr says transfer of hostages' bodies 'was ...	Harr, who was rescued from Rafah in an IDF operation, tells Ynet that, despite the tragedy of the return of dead hostages, 'the circle is closed - and the families can begin to live and move on with the loss'; He has worked in the struggle to bring the hostages home: 'When I was rescued and they gave me my life back I realized I had a mission.' Former hostage Luis Harr, who was rescued from Rafah in Operation Golden Hand in February 2024 after 129 days in captivity, spoke with Ynet Thursday and shared his feelings regarding the return of the killed hostages Oded Lifshitz and Shiri Bibas along with with her children Kfir and Ariel. 'It's hard to accept this,' he told Ynet, 'We were hoping for a miracle.' Harr, who was kidnapped from Gaza border Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak along with Fernando Marman - who was rescued with him, shared: 'It's a strange feeling. As if we should have been prepared for this, and yet it's not enough. We constantly had the fear that the four were really not among the living, but we wanted to believe that maybe a miracle would happen, maybe something that would change reality.' He said, 'We need to understand that, even if it's about the fallen, it closes the circle, it reassures the families that it's final. There's no more 'maybe yes-maybe no,' which is what's so difficult for families during this time, that there's no end to it. The circle is closed and these families can start living a more normal, quieter life - without expectations - and move on with the loss. It's a loss for all of us, for the entire family of the hostage. We feel sorry for everyone. At least we know they're not suffering anymore.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Harr explained his decision to take part in the struggle to return the hostages, in which he appears at rallies and is interviewed by the media. 'It came from within,' he said. 'When the soldiers from the Yamam unit rescued me and gave me my life back, I realized that I also have a mission. This is my mission: to help everyone, to give hope to everyone, to give light, as if I was chosen for getting my life back, and I fulfill it as much as possible. I can't sit quietly at home and do nothing.' We heard Avital Dekel-Chen talk about Sagui's feelings of guilt, and she said that he reads a story to his daughters and some fathers can't 'We are divided, our hearts are divided. One half is with the joy: I was rescued, I'm here, I'm alive, with my grandchildren and children. The other half is constantly thinking about all the kidnapped people who are still there. They want to end it, and everything revolves around that. How can I rehabilitate myself, if I constantly think about those who haven't returned yet? I haven't returned home yet, I'm not in a normal life, it will never go back to what it was. I need to learn about my new life. I want to do it together with everyone, which means everyone will be here. And for the families' suffering to end.' We are at the end of Phase I of the deal, and on Saturday six hostages will return alive. According to estimates, 24 hostages remain alive in captivity in horrific conditions. What goes through your mind when you hear the testimonies? 'I say that we need to bring everyone home as quickly as possible. The price doesn't matter, nothing matters. First of all, bring everyone home. That's why I agree with everything we talked about before. The peace of the families, starting to return to a more normal life, because we can't continue with the not knowing. Whether they come or not, fallen or not, we need to get it over with, bring everyone. Either for rehabilitation or to a proper Israeli burial, everyone.' Harr said that he never received a visit or a phone call from the decision-makers. 'I did not even receive a phone call from any of those who actually make decisions. It is very strange to me, because without their signature I could not be here, so it is not that they do not know. I should thank them for this, I can only thank them, but I have no one - because I have no contact with anyone.' When asked what he thought was the explanation for not contacting him, he replied: 'I try not to explain to myself or anyone. I live my life, I am at peace with myself. I do my own thing and work for all the hostages, giving hope, giving light, if someone does not want to talk to me, that is their problem, not mine.' F>ound an error?

A new Lebanon opens up, 20 years after assassination of Rafic Har...	His assassination — along with the killing of 21 others in the explosion of a 1,000-kilogram TNT bomb — marked a breaking point in Lebanon The sky opened up for the Hariris. After two weeks of relentless rain, Beirut awoke to a sunny day for the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. Thousands of people from across Lebanon gathered to honor the memory of the late prime minister, who was killed on a cold Valentine’s Day in 2005. His assassination — along with the killing of 21 others in the explosion of a 1,000-kilogram TNT bomb — marked a turning point in Lebanon. A large segment of the population aligned with the anti-Syrian camp, blaming the Syrian regime for orchestrating the attack. Lilian Abdelrahman was nine years old when she heard the explosion that shook Lebanon. 'I was at school, and we were shocked and very upset,' she recalled from Martyrs’ Square in Beirut during the commemoration of that tragic day. 'It was terrifying, and it was a very ugly day for Lebanon because Rafic Hariri was a very great person, and there will be no one like him again,' she said. Rafic Hariri, a towering political figure, had resigned as prime minister nearly four months earlier. He was Lebanon’s first post-civil war premier and was widely credited for his role in drafting the Taif Agreement, which ended the 15-year conflict. As a businessman, he played a major role in rebuilding Beirut and became the most influential and wealthiest Lebanese politician of his time. During his two terms (1992-1998 and 2000-2004), he sought to strengthen Lebanese sovereignty and limit foreign interference, particularly from Syria and Iran. But he paid for it with his life. His efforts to curtail Hezbollah’s military presence created tensions with both Damascus and Tehran. When the massive bomb detonated in Beirut on that cold February Monday, many were already convinced that his assassination was tied to his attempts to disarm the Lebanese militia and steer Lebanon away from Syrian and Iranian influence. Four years after his assassination, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon was established to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the attack. Under United Nations authority, the court applied Lebanese criminal law and had primacy over the country’s judiciary. In 2022, it sentenced two Hezbollah members in absentia to life imprisonment for the bombing that killed Hariri and 21 others, though the group has refused to hand them over. In the immediate aftermath of the assassination, thousands took to the streets in grief. Since the civil war, Syrian troops under the Assad family had occupied Lebanon. Hariri’s killing triggered a political crisis, sparking mass anti-Syrian protests and mounting international pressure. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Cedar Revolution had begun. 'Twenty years ago, in this square, you demanded justice, and by your own will, you expelled the criminal regime of Bashar Assad from Lebanon,' said Saad Hariri, Rafic’s son and twice Lebanon’s prime minister, speaking Friday from the stage in Martyrs’ Square. On March 8, 2005, pro-Syrian parties — most notably Hezbollah and Amal — responded with a mass demonstration in downtown Beirut against the Cedar Revolution. Christian leader Michel Aoun’s Free Patriotic Movement joined them, forming the March 8 Alliance. Six days later, a counterprotest of nearly a million people demanded 'Freedom, Sovereignty, Independence.' This alliance, which included the Maronite Phalangist (Kataib) Party, the Lebanese Forces, Walid Jumblatt’s Druze Progressive Socialist Party, and the Future Movement — then led by Saad Hariri —became known as the March 14 Movement. Despite the withdrawal of Syrian troops after 29 years of occupation, a new era of Hezbollah dominance and Iranian influence began. 'There was nothing; no one could breathe,' said Lilian. Now, after two months of brutal war between Israeli forces and Hezbollah — during which nearly 4,000 people have been killed in Lebanon — the country has changed dramatically. Hezbollah has been significantly weakened, and Lebanon has a new government and a new president. 'If we continue on this path, God willing, we are going to a better place, and Lebanon will return to being the Switzerland of the East,' said Omar Saadi, a 22-year-old from Beirut. 'We will stay away from these wars and get rid of the sectarian problems, especially us as Sunni people, so we will be part of the state again and can rebuild this country,' he said. In recent years, Lebanon’s Sunni community has seen its political influence wane. The Future Movement abstained from the 2022 legislative elections, and Saad Hariri retired from politics shortly before, relocating abroad. 'Just as you have been by my side for 20 years, I, in turn, will remain by your side and will not leave you,' Saad Hariri told thousands of Future Movement supporters in his speech. A new Lebanon, indeed.

BBC apologizes for airing film featuring senior Hamas official’s ...	The film 'Gaza: How to Survive in a War Zone' depicts the lives of four boys in Gaza during the war with Israel - but it failed to disclose to viewers that one of the film’s protagonists was the son of a senior Hamas official, 13-year-old Abdullah al-Yazouri Three days after airing a documentary about the lives of children and teenagers in Gaza, the BBC has apologized, admitting it was unaware that one of the film’s protagonists is the son of a senior Hamas official and failed to disclose this to viewers. The teenager, identified as Abdullah al-Yazouri, was named by independent journalist David Collier, who shared his findings on X. According to Collier, al-Yazouri also appeared in a Channel 4 News report last November under the name Abdullah Abu Shamala. Collier revealed that 14-year-old Abdullah, who narrates the documentary in his own voice, is the son of Ayman al-Yazouri, a high-ranking Hamas official currently serving as the group’s agriculture minister which was not mentioned in the BBC’s documentary 'Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone.' The film, directed by Jamie Roberts and Yusuf Hammash, aired Monday on BBC Two. It follows the lives of four young Gazans during the ongoing war with Israel. The directors were not present in Gaza during filming; instead, they coordinated remotely with local Palestinian videographers and crew members. In a statement issued, the BBC said that since the documentary aired three days ago, it had 'become aware of the family connections of the film’s narrator, a child called Abdullah.'

For future broadcasts and availability on iPlayer, the film will now clarify: 'The narrator of this film is 13-year-old Abdullah. His father has worked as a deputy agriculture minister for the Hamas-run government in Gaza. The production team had full editorial control of filming with Abdullah.' The statement has been added to the BBC’s Corrections and Clarifications page, and the broadcaster said it will also issue a direct response to the letter. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1vm3kncyl	2025-02-20T02:27:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/20/BJbp1KP4ckx/BJbp1KP4ckx_435_232_1721_968_0_small.jpg

The Kremlin said on Thursday that any plan to send European troops to Ukraine as part of a potential peacekeeping mission would be unacceptable for Russia and that it was monitoring such proposals with concern. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said he is 'ready and willing' to put UK troops on the ground in Ukraine, with U.S. backing, as a security guarantee in the event of some sort of a cease-fire deal between Moscow and Kyiv. Starmer is planning to present a plan to U.S. President Donald Trump to send fewer than 30,000 European servicemen to Ukraine in exchange for American protection of the troops, the Telegraph newspaper reported. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the reported proposal was unacceptable because it would involve forces from a NATO member state and therefore have ramifications for Russia's own security.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkke0knc1g	2025-02-20T02:13:19-08:00

Israelis line streets to honor dead hostages as they return home:...	It is a show of solidarity on one the war's most difficult days since Hamas attack on October 7; 'There’s a lot of sorrow and anger because we wanted to see them alive' Dozens of residents of Kibbutz Nir Oz gathered Thursday ahead of the return of four deceased hostages: kibbutz members Oded Lifshitz, Shiri Bibas, and her children Kfir and Ariel. The residents wore stickers of broken hearts and stood for a moment of silence. 'There’s a lot of sorrow and anger because we wanted to see them alive — we could have seen them alive,' said Ilai, a kibbutz resident. 'We can’t be certain they’re identified and the family confirms it. The disregard for the families' dignity must stop. It's a sad day — and even today, there are still hostages in hell.' Renana Yaakov, whose sons Or and Yigal were freed in the first hostage deal, added, 'People need to be reminded that, at every moment, there are people rotting in tunnels in Gaza. We know what the tunnel looks like, entire lives have passed while they're stuck there. One of my children was there and the thought that others still are doesn’t let me rest.' She expressed anger at the 'abandonment — that it took over 500 days to bring them back, and they returned in coffins. It could have been different. It’s sad, frustrating, infuriating. But at the same time, there's relief, acceptance, even hope — because when deceased hostages are returned, it means we can bring back others so they can be laid to rest.' Emily Damari, who was freed after 471 days in Hamas captivity, posted an image in solidarity with the Bibas family. Inbal and Itay Zeidenberg, also from Kibbutz Nir Oz, described the day as a 'difficult, heartbreaking, and shattering day that highlights the scale of the abandonment. There’s always hope, and many hostages still need to return. There are also deceased hostages held there and we're anxiously waiting for them.' 'We have hope because so many people in this country stand with us and agree that human dignity, life, mutual responsibility and the state's duty to its citizens are what truly matter.' Itay added, 'Being part of this community means being prepared for devastating news every day, every minute.'

One of them, Nitai Faust from Tze'elim, said:'Everyone is connected here. Families are connected, friends are the same. We studied at the same schools. And Yarden (Bibas) is from Tze'elim.' 'The government ministers aren’t here at all,' Faust added. 'So it's important for us to show that we're here with the hostages, both the living and the dead. It’s clear that we need to recognize the victims of this atrocity. They're part of us. We are them.' Neta Geva from Ein HaBesor and Sarit Kani from Kibbutz Magen stressed:'There’s no choice but to stand here. Oded was a friend. It’s natural for us to come and say we’re sorry. We feel we didn’t scream enough, didn’t do enough. This area is like one big family. Everyone knows everyone. Everyone is together and the absence is enormous. The anger is great — the neglect continues because not everyone is coming home by the end of this week.' Michal Bilia, whose brother-in-law Ariel Bilia was murdered on October 7 while defending his family in Ofakim, also came out to the streets. 'It was clear to us that we needed to come and escort the deceased with dignity,' she said. 'We wanted to show the families that we're with them in their hardest moments, and in some way, to show Hamas that against their ridiculous and cynical displays, we stand here with pride, with Israeli flags, proving that we're the complete opposite — that we honor our dead and don’t give up on anyone.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj6jd0045yg	2025-02-20T01:17:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/20/rkz6dZPEc1x/rkz6dZPEc1x_0_282_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Meet the Israeli robotic system set to transform warfare	Developed by Plasan in Israel’s north, the ATeMM robotic system is redefining battlefield mobility, reducing risks for soldiers and increasing operational efficiency A new electric robotic system could transform the battlefield in the coming decades—at least, that’s what its creators believe. Israel-based defense company Plasan recently introduced the All-Terrain Electric Mission Module (ATeMM), a cutting-edge system designed to enhance military mobility and efficiency. The system supports a wide range of battlefield applications, including logistics, energy, munitions and sensors. For over a decade, modern warfare has become increasingly automated and precise, relying less on human soldiers in some cases. The past 16 months of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) operations in Gaza, Lebanon, and other fronts have highlighted this shift, with drones dominating the skies and AI-powered combat systems playing a growing role. Plasan, however, sees the future of military technology in integrated, multidisciplinary systems like the ATeMM. 'This is basically an electric driveline with two wheels that is connected to a leading vehicle—connected in such a way that it becomes part of the vehicle drive itself,' explained Duby Cohen, vice president of Integrated Systems for Plasan, who gave The Media Line a tour of Plasan’s Galilee factory earlier this month. Traditional trailers struggle with battlefield mobility, making them difficult to maneuver. In contrast, the ATeMM offers far greater agility. 'This platform drives itself, connected to the computer of the vehicle, so it actually does what the vehicle does. So, if the driver turns the wheels of the vehicle, then the wheel of the ATeMM goes the same way,' Cohen said. 'When you are doing reverse again, it’s doing the same, so it’s not like doing a reverse with a trailer. It’s like doing a reverse with a six-by-six vehicle.' By integrating ATeMM with a lead vehicle, military units can significantly reduce the number of trucks and drivers required for a mission. A 4×4 can instantly transform into a 6×6 or even an 8×8, increasing payload capacity while maintaining maneuverability. 'Today, if I have six vehicles working in my battalion, I need six vehicles, six drivers, with a total payload of 10 tons,' explained Gilad Ariav, Plasan’s vice president of marketing and business development. 'But if I attach two tandems, I can reduce that by 50%—from six to three vehicles—and still carry the same load. 'We want to decrease the number of drivers and vehicles,' he stressed. Beyond reducing manpower, ATeMM can also operate independently. It can be detached from the lead vehicle and remotely controlled in the field, effectively transforming into an autonomous robotic unit. 'Once it’s disconnected from the vehicle, you can change it to a robot,' Ariav explained. 'There is a remote control in the field.' This autonomous capability allows the ATeMM to operate independently for up to 100 kilometers on a single charge—an advantage Ariav claims no competitor currently offers. ATeMM is also a highly adaptable platform that can be equipped for various battlefield needs. 'You can put any kind of system on it,' Ariav said. 'Guns, missile systems, attacking drones.' It can even serve as a mobile docking station for soldiers. 'You just have some kind of huge battery that can charge everything,' he said. 'So, the soldiers, once his battery is empty, it does not stop his mission. He goes to the docking station, puts the battery inside, takes a fully charged one, and continues his mission.' Cohen said that Israel’s Ministry of Defense has already adopted the technology, with four ATeMMs currently in use in combat and more expected to be deployed. The vehicle-robot resembles a massive open trailer with oversized wheels and two black, tentacle-like rods. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ariav added that the vehicles have been able to operate for about two weeks without needing to recharge. When recharging is necessary, it can be done either by driving—though the rate of charging is uncertain—or by using an external power source, which fully recharges the unit in under six hours. Operating under fire What’s striking is that this cutting-edge military technology was developed in Israel’s periphery — on Kibbutz Sasa in northern Galilee. Plasan also operates a subsidiary in nearby Dalton. 'Our slogan is protecting those who protect us,' said Ariav. 'That’s what we do. That’s why we wake up in the morning—to make sure that our soldiers protecting us are being protected.' Plasan’s workforce reflects the diversity of the Galilee, with employees from Jewish, Muslim, and Christian communities. Today, the company’s sales to the Israeli market account for 20-30% of its total revenue, Ariav said. Since its founding in 1985, Plasan has manufactured over 40,000 armored kits for platforms and soldiers in more than 50 countries, including several NATO members. When war broke out on October 7, 2023, the IDF immediately contacted Plasan to acquire all available armored vehicles, Ariav recalled. The military also requested the company to rapidly produce as many armored plates as possible to protect Israeli soldiers. Kibbutz Sasa, located near Israel’s Lebanese border, was evacuated due to the escalating conflict. Meanwhile, about 20% of Plasan’s employees were called up to the reserves. Although the company had the necessary machinery to manufacture armored plates, it had not focused on this type of production for years. Despite these challenges, the factory continued operating, with more than 350 employees reporting to work daily from wherever they had been relocated. The ballistic plate production line ran 24/7, including on Shabbat, producing approximately 35,000 armored plates for IDF soldiers. All this was done while still fulfilling orders for Plasan’s international clients. Ariav takes great pride in Plasan’s work, emphasizing what sets the company apart—above all, its innovative, customer-focused approach. 'If you have a special problem, come to us,' he said. 'We’ll solve it.' One notable example of Plasan’s problem-solving expertise was its work for the U.S. Army during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. As a subcontractor for the Wisconsin-based company Oshkosh, Plasan provided thousands of vehicle protection kits for Oshkosh’s Mine Resistant Ambush Protected All-Terrain Vehicles (M-ATVs). Designed specifically for Afghanistan’s rough terrain, the M-ATV is a highly mobile armored vehicle built to withstand roadside bombs and other threats. Plasan’s armor system was engineered to absorb and deflect blast energy from mines or explosives, reducing the impact on both the soldiers inside and the vehicle’s critical components. This not only increased the troops’ chances of survival but also ensured they could quickly exit the vehicle if needed. Ariav said Plasan developed these armor kits in less than a year—a rapid turnaround that, he believes, ultimately saved thousands of American soldiers’ lives. Made 100% in Israel Ariav explained that one of the biggest challenges in designing armored vehicles is finding the right balance between protection, weight, and cost. Steel provides strong protection but is too heavy, while titanium is lightweight and highly effective but prohibitively expensive. To address this, Plasan has developed proprietary composite materials that he believes offer the best solution. Cohen demonstrated how these composite materials are made inside the factory. The process involves combining steel, ceramic, specialized adhesives, and other elements to create protective armor. These components are mixed, pressed, and shaped into tiles. The shape of each tile—whether hexagonal, circular, triangular, or another form—depends on its intended use. Once formed, the tiles are carefully pressed and assembled into the final protective armor. Despite being smaller than major Israeli defense companies like Elbit Systems, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, and Israel Aerospace Industries, Plasan manages the entire lifecycle of its products—from initial design to final production. The company’s engineering team specializes in ballistic protection, system engineering, composite materials, and automotive technology. 'We know how to design the armor of the vehicle, how to integrate stuff on the vehicle and mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and so on,' Ariav said, adding that Plasan has its own prototyping department and conducts field simulations to test its designs. According to Yaron Roded, marketing director of armored vehicles for Plasan, the company produces around 10 vehicles per week. A crew of three workers assembles each vehicle before passing it along to different teams responsible for interior, exterior, and final assembly. Roded pointed to a vehicle currently used by the IDF to carry specialized mission equipment and proudly noted, 'The quality and level of performance of those vehicles are identical to any European or American vehicles,' yet they are made entirely in Israel. From a pricing standpoint, he explained that Plasan aims to remain competitive, and as demand increases, production costs naturally decrease. Cohen acknowledged that operating in northern Israel poses logistical challenges, particularly when transporting raw materials. However, he believes the location offers a key advantage: 'We are like a family. Everyone lives nearby, everyone knows each other, and we are really taking care of the area’s economic health.' The future of warfare Ariav believes Plasan is 'on the right path,' particularly with the ATeMM. He emphasized that no army wants to unnecessarily endanger its soldiers, and robotic systems are becoming an integral part of modern warfare. 'There is a virus of robots in the field now,' he said, predicting even greater advancements in the coming decade. Yet, despite the increasing use of robotic technology, he has not seen any system that addresses logistical challenges as effectively as Plasan’s ATeMM. 'We don’t see any competitors that attach the robot to a simple vehicle,' Cohen said. 'Each one of them has his own robots,' each designed for a specific task. In contrast, ATeMM offers unmatched flexibility, seamlessly transitioning from one mission to another. 'This is going to be a revolution,' he said.

Residents of Kibbutz Misgav Am share their thoughts on returning home: 'Most people are not feeling safe' Israel’s northern communities have been evacuated since the start of the Gaza war, when Hezbollah began firing rockets at civilian areas. Homes were heavily damaged, acres of farmland were set on fire, and—worst of all—30 Israelis lost their lives due to Hezbollah’s hostilities. Now, the residents of Kibbutz Misgav Am share their thoughts on returning home. 'I'm not feeling safe,' said Ofer Moskovitz Poshko, a displaced citizen of Misgav Am. 'Most people are not feeling safe because nobody knows what will happen. Now, the army has left Lebanon. So people, I think, will wait to see what happens at the border.'

Hostage handover will start with cruel 'ceremony' before 4 bodies...	One of the most difficult days since October 7 has begun: The bodies of Shiri Bibas, her young children Kfir and Ariel, and Oded Lipshitz will be transferred to Israel from the town of Bani Suheila near Khan Younis. Israel said that a 'ceremony' is a violation of the cease-fire agreement The 503 days of hope for a different ending are shattered, as Israel begins of one of the most difficult days since October 7. Four killed hostages - who according to Hamas are Shiri Bibas, her young children Kfir and Ariel , and Oded Lipshitz - will be handed over to Israel Thursday morning, as part of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. Israel confirmed the names of the hostages Wednesday evening. At the request of the families, Ynet will not publish the harsh photos of the stage and the expected cynical 'ceremony' that Hamas is planning in Bani Suheila, a suburb of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. On the stage at the ceremony, pictures of the four are displayed, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu depicted as a bloodthirsty vampire above them. The horrific caption alongside it, which also includes many errors in Hebrew, reads: 'The war criminal murdered them, with the missiles of fighter jets.' Alongside it, against a background of pictures of coffins covered with Israeli flags: 'Return to war - return of the hostages in coffins.' The Red Cross, to which the dead hostages will be transferred, will hand over the bodies to the IDF inside the Gaza Strip. Upon receiving the fallen hostages, they will be transferred to coffins covered with Israeli flags. At the handover ceremony, there will be a military rabbi who will read Psalms and and the El Moleh Rachamim prayer for the dead. From the Gaza Strip, the coffins will be transported in military vehicles directly to the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Abu Kabir for identification. An Israeli official referred to the intention to perform a 'ceremony' and said that it would be a violation of the agreements between Israel and the mediators, under which Israel insisted that there would be no ceremonies and showpieces. 'We talked about handing over the bodies in a dignified and appropriate manner. We made it clear that we do not agree to ceremonies and that the handover will be carried out in a dignified manner, and this is coordinated between us, the Red Cross and the mediators,' the official said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF spokesman will document the arrival status of the coffins, and the distribution of the photos will be the responsibility of the families of the fallen. As part of a secret annex to the agreement, the killed hostages will be transferred to Israel Thursday instead of on Saturday, the official day of the next round of returning hostages, because the process of identifying them can take up to 48 hours. This will ensure that Hamas complies with the agreement and handed over the dead Israelis. Only after there is official identification will Israel be able to confirm that the terrorist organization did indeed comply with the agreement, and only then will the security prisoners be released. On Saturday, the last six living hostages set to be returned in Phase I will be released - Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen, Tal Shoham, Avraham Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed - and next week four additional hostages will be handed over. To meet the deadlines, the remaining hostages will also be handed over next week on Thursday, the 40th day of the deal. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjfjsnv9kg	2025-02-19T20:36:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/S161Tj75kx/S161Tj75kx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Trump warns Zelensky to quickly negotiate war's end with Russia o...	President Donald Trump on Wednesday warned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he 'better move fast' to negotiate an end to Russia's invasion of Ukraine or risk not having a nation to lead. The rhetoric from Trump toward Ukraine comes amid an escalating back-and-forth between the two presidents and rising tensions between Washington and much of Europe over Trump's approach to settling the biggest conflict on the continent since World War II. Trump's harsh words for Zelensky drew criticism from Democrats and even some Republicans in the United States, where Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression has had bipartisan support. Zelensky said Trump was falling into a Russian disinformation trap - and was quickly admonished by Vice President JD Vance about the perils of publicly criticizing the new president. Trump, who is trying to bring the fighting to a close on terms that Kyiv says are too favorable to Moscow, used an extended social media post on his Truth Social platform to lash out at Zelensky and call the Ukrainian a' dictator without elections.' Due to the war, Ukraine did delay elections that were scheduled for April 2024.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1swrn45kx	2025-02-19T19:54:51-08:00

Freed hostage Agam Berger talks about her religious observance - ...	The IDF lookout freed in the third round of hostage releases under the current deal shared her captivity ordeal: 'The terrorists said, 'Take it.' We used it a lot; it gave us strength,' she said of the prayer book she received; she also recalled tracking Jewish holidays: 'We fasted on Yom Kippur' Agam Berger, who was released two weeks ago as part of the third round of the current hostage deal, recently met with Rebbetzin Tzili Schneider, chair of Kesher Yehudi, and journalist Shneor Webber. During their conversation, she shared chilling details of her captivity in Gaza, the challenges of maintaining her faith, and the unwavering belief that sustained her through unimaginable hardship. Berger revealed that, nearly a year ago, the hostages were surprised when Hamas terrorists provided them with various items, including a Jewish prayer book, or siddur. 'We have no idea how it happened, but they simply handed us prayer books,' Berger recalled. 'They showed them to us and said, ‘Take them.’ We used them constantly. It gave us strength.' The siddur was not the only item found. Berger said that the captors also discovered personal belongings of Israeli soldiers, such as military dog tags. However, she found the delivery of the prayer book particularly unusual. 'It wasn’t random,' she said with certainty. 'It arrived exactly when we needed it most.' Holding onto faith in the darkest times Despite the dire conditions, the hostages made efforts to track the Hebrew calendar and observe Jewish holidays to the best of their ability. 'We roughly knew the dates from the radio and sometimes from segments shown on television,' Berger said. 'That helped us understand when the holidays were approaching.' However, not all holidays could be observed. 'We missed Hanukkah, but during Passover, I managed to avoid eating leavened bread,' she recalled. 'I used corn flour because that’s what was available. The captors didn’t really care about it.' She noted that while the captors harbored deep hatred toward Jews, they showed a level of respect toward religious individuals. 'They hate Jews, but to them, it’s better to be religious than to have no faith at all.' One of the most significant moments of her captivity was Yom Kippur. 'We managed to fast, and I remember praying a lot that day,' she said. 'I also fasted on the Fast of Esther. It was something I felt I had to do, especially given our circumstances.' Uncertainty and separation For most of her captivity, Berger was held alongside fellow hostage Liri Albag and, at times, with other women. 'There were moments when we were together, and it was easier. But then they separated us,' she said. The day before Albag was released was especially difficult. 'They told her on a Friday that she was going to record a video in the middle of the day, but they didn’t tell me she was being sent home,' Berger said. 'For two days, I had no idea.' When she was finally informed of her own impending release, Berger asked about the others. 'They told me, ‘Your friends are already home,’' she recalled. 'It was an overwhelming moment. I knew I was going to be freed, but I wasn’t certain until the very last second.' In the final days of her captivity, Berger and another hostage, Arbel Yehoud, were among the last remaining women. 'By that point, we understood that Shiri Bibas was in a different situation. We didn’t know her exact condition, but we knew she had to be released first.' Looking back, Berger expressed deep gratitude for those who supported her throughout her ordeal. 'I don’t know how I would have survived without my faith,' she said. 'In the end, that’s what gave me hope.' Schneider, who accompanied Berger’s family throughout the ordeal, described meeting her as a profound and moving experience. 'It was an incredible honor to hear firsthand about Agam’s unwavering dedication to her faith under such impossible conditions,' Schneider said. 'She sanctified God’s name in public and inspired the entire Jewish people.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjz36tmcje	2025-02-19T13:17:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/ByVnuo791l/ByVnuo791l_0_180_961_540_0_small.jpg

A source in the Prime Minister's Office commented on the publication of the announcement about the return of the bodies of hostages Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir and the response of Ofri Bibas, the sister of Yarden Bibas, who said that no confirmation had been received from the family about this. The source said that ''This was a grave mistake on the part of the IDF liaison officers communicating with the Bibas family, which resulted from an unfortunate human error.' According to him, 'the officers approved publishing the names to reporters, even though no confirmation had been received from the family. In any case, at no point was an official statement published from the Prime Minister's Office with the names of the fallen hostages.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkuo3aq5yg	2025-02-19T12:29:56-08:00

Sky News' anchor cries on air after reporting Bibas family in kil...	As the news broke, host Chris Kenny struggled to hold back tears, saying: 'If you need clarification of Hamas' sheer brutality, today’s announcement makes it painfully clear'; He added that: 'These cowardly murderers deserve no mercy. Hamas must be eliminated' Sky News host Chris Kenny fought back tears while reading an announcement that Hamas will return the bodies of four hostages, including members of the Bibas family. 'If you need any clarification about the horrors of the Middle East conflict and the sheer brutality of Hamas and its supporters, today’s announcement makes it painfully clear,' Kenny said. 'Hamas has announced it will return the bodies of four hostages, including the two youngest captives. According to the BBC, the group’s negotiator, Khalil Al-Hayya, stated that the bodies include those of Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Kfir and Ariel, who were just 9 months and 4 years old when Hamas kidnapped them during the October 7, 2023, attack.' Kenny struggled to speak through the tears as he talked about the dead children. 'The return of their bodies confirms the devastating news we had feared since the earliest days of this tragedy. More than 16 months ago, the world saw footage of Hamas terrorists and their supporters abducting Shiri at gunpoint as she clung to her children. They were alive and well when taken. Now, they are dead.' 'While the circumstances of their deaths remain unclear, one fact is undeniable: they would still be alive if Hamas had not kidnapped them. The terrorists used them as human shields, exploiting their innocence in their campaign of slaughter and destruction.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Shiri Bibas, a devoted mother, refused to let go of her boys. Now, she and her children are among Hamas’ many victims. Ask yourself: How often did world leaders, politicians, or activists demand the Bibas family’s release? How often did the media highlight their plight while broadcasting Hamas propaganda?' 'Hamas commits crimes against humanity day after day, for over 500 days, yet some still justify its actions. As a cease-fire takes effect, these terrorists discard their civilian disguises and parade as soldiers, pretending to show goodwill. Just weeks ago, they released Shiri’s husband, Yarden Bibas, while now preparing to return the bodies of his wife and children.' Kenny pointed to the yellow ribbon pin he wore and explained that he wears it to remember the plight of the hostages. 'These cowardly murderers deserve no mercy. Hamas must be eliminated, not negotiated with. Now, they trade the bodies of kidnapped children to secure the release of their own terrorists from Israeli prisons. They can sink no lower.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syhew3xqkl	2025-02-19T12:20:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/B11TzTm9kx/B11TzTm9kx_8_0_1427_803_0_small.jpg

Ceremony with a rabbi in the Gaza Strip, coffins wrapped in the I...	In a first since the outbreak of the war, Hamas will transfer the remains of killed hostages to the Red Cross on Thursday morning, which will pass them to the IDF in Gaza; A ceremony will be held, and families will be notified only after formal identification Israel is bracing for one of the most difficult days since the start of the current hostage deal, as four hostages who were murdered in captivity are set to be returned on Thursday. Security officials are preparing for their dignified repatriation, identification and burial. According to Hamas, the bodies will be handed over to the Red Cross at 8 a.m. From there, they will be transferred to Israeli forces inside Gaza. The military rabbinate will hold a solemn ceremony at the transfer site, where the remains will be placed in caskets draped with Israeli flags. Military personnel and a rabbi will be present before the caskets are transported to Israel for forensic identification. 'Tomorrow will be a very difficult day for the State of Israel. A wrenching day, a day of grief,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. 'We embrace the families, and the heart of the entire nation is torn. My own heart is torn. So is yours. And all of the world's heart should be torn, because this demonstrates who we are dealing with, what we are dealing with — with such monsters,' Netanyahu added. 'We are grieving, we are in pain, but we are also determined to ensure that such a thing never happens again.' The IDF acknowledged the painful reality in a statement: 'The military did not succeed in bringing them home alive, but we will ensure they receive a proper burial.' Some identifications may be completed quickly at the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute, while others could take up to 48 hours. Military rabbis urged patience and cautioned against the spread of rumors. A formal notification will be delivered to each family only after official identification, and not based on Hamas' statements. Military officials anticipate that Hamas will claim the hostages were killed in Israeli airstrikes, but stress that the exact cause of death will only be determined following a thorough examination. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to Jewish law, families who had previously observed the seven-day mourning period (shiva) without burying their loved ones will mark a single day of mourning after the burial. Those whose loved one’s death was not officially confirmed until now will begin the full seven-day mourning period. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum issued a statement ahead of the transfer: 'This is a heartbreaking moment as four hostages who were taken alive return to us in death. We will gather in Hostages Square from the morning, standing shoulder to shoulder with the families, bearing this grief together. We say clearly: Time has run out for those still held captive. They must be returned immediately—survivors for rehabilitation, and the fallen for a proper burial.' A memorial event is planned for 7 p.m. in Hostages Square on Thursday, featuring families, artists and public figures. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjzi00tqqkl	2025-02-19T11:52:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/rJNtGjgW5yl/rJNtGjgW5yl_0_62_1280_720_0_small.jpg

The end of Oded Lifshitz's life was 'tragic,' his son says: 'He l...	Yizhar Lifshitz, Oded's son, who received the news that his father was one of the dead hostages who will be repatriated Thursday, tells Ynet: 'The feelings are difficult. I would prefer to know that he was murdered on October 7th and not that he had to go through all the suffering and torture' Yizhar Lifshitz, son of Oded Lifshitz, said Wednesday evening that the family members first learned Wednesday afternoon from the terrorist organizations in Gaza that their father would be included in the release of the four killed hostages on Thursday morning. With the families' approval, Israel later announced that the hostages who would be returned were Shiri Bibas and her children, Kfir and Ariel, and Oded Lifshitz. 'Until he is identified, nothing will be determined, but we are prepared for it to happen tomorrow,' he told Ynet. Even before Israel's announcement of receiving the list, Yitzhar Lipshitz said, 'We saw a statement from Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Everything shows that it's going to happen tomorrow, but until they actually pass the body over, and until we know that they didn't make some mistake then we will get the answer and that's it. We have known for a long time that there is fear for his life.' 'The feelings are difficult,' Yitzhar described. 'The feeling is that he left alive, was kidnapped alive, and returned dead. The kibbutz is burned, the community is slaughtered, so what feelings can there be? Not simple feelings.' He spoke of the many hostages from the kibbutz who were murdered in captivity, including Haim Perry, Alex Danzig and Yoram Metzger. 'We miss them. Members of Kibbutz Nir Oz who were murdered in the tunnels and were returned. There are five of them. That's part of the tragedy here, but it's closing a circle.' He said he wanted to join the celebrations of the families of the hostages who will return on Saturday, but right now 'there is no appropriate time for such things, and it will come. We will deal with it.' As the son of your father Oded, how do you feel? 'I feel like an orphan. The story of the kidnappings is one of the most difficult, because there is no orderly separation from the kidnapped. We know that my father lived in an apartment for at least two or three weeks after he was kidnapped. He was wounded, in pain, bruised from the beatings and with gunshot wounds in his hand – alone, miserable, in some apartment in Khan Younis, without knowing what happened to his friends from the kibbutz or to my mother.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Yizhar Lipshitz said there was evidence that his father was looking for her, and asked if anyone knew what happened to her. 'But my mother was kidnapped straight into the tunnels, and he was kidnapped later to another place. He tried to figure out what happened to her - but they had never met since the moment they broke into the protected room.' He added that 'as his son, I would have preferred to know that he was murdered on October 7th outside his home in Nir Oz rather than that he had to go through all this suffering and torture and be alone and die like a dog there in Gaza. It's a sad story, his life ended in a tragic and humiliating, undeserved, despicable way. So did many from the Kibbutz Nir Oz community. His house was burned down, his wife was kidnapped with beatings that he must have seen. Terrible. Without the family, without children, without closure.' According to him, this is a tragedy that accompanies many families: 'Hostages who lived their entire lives inside there without us, in terrible distress, and this hole will always remain.' He also spoke about the feeling of loss that accompanies those who have lost a relative: 'When some return alive and some dead, you feel the loss. But I don't compare myself to parents who lost children - my father was 84 years old, he had grandchildren, he lived a full life.' Arrived at Nir Oz in 1956: 'His life's work' Oded was kidnapped from his home on the kibbutz. His wife, Yocheved Lifshitz, was also kidnapped from their home and was released in October 2023 along with Nurit Cooper. Yocheved said that on the morning of the massacre Oded tried to close the door to the protected room but the terrorists shot him in the hand. She was taken by the terrorists on a moped while Oded lay in the doorway of the house, unconscious and bleeding. It later emerged that the kidnappers had dressed Oded in a galabiya and that he had been held captive for 20 days with Hana Katzir, who was also kidnapped and released. Yocheved and Oded Lifshitz established a magnificent and unique cactus garden in Nir Oz. Daniel, their grandson, said: 'My grandfather arrived in Nir Oz in 1956, the kibbutz is his and my grandmother's life's work.' Oded was a former peace activist who transported Palestinian cancer patients from Gaza to receive treatment in hospitals in Israel. The Lifshitz family asked to convey through the Hostages and Missing Families Forum: 'These hours are not easy for us, after we were informed that our beloved Oded is on the list of thedead hostages who will return to Israel tomorrow, after being kidnapped alive from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. For 502 days we hoped and prayed for a different ending, but until we receive absolute certainty, our journey will not end, and even after that we will continue to fight until the last hostage is returned.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk1ln3q5kg	2025-02-19T11:11:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/HJfDkiQc1g/HJfDkiQc1g_0_0_850_1000_0_small.jpg
HIAS, Jewish American group helping refugees, scrambles after Tru...	A Jewish American organization, long supported by the U.S. government to assist those escaping conflict and oppressive regimes, is set to scale back significantly its operations after U.S. President Donald Trump's order to stop refugee admissions and almost all development assistance spending. HIAS President Mark Hetfield described the aftermath of Trump's orders, part of a broader 'America First' realignment of the government, as 'complete chaos,' saying that there had been limited engagement by U.S. officials. Trump's January 20 executive orders paused nearly all foreign aid spending for 90 days, hitting humanitarian groups hard, and indefinitely suspended the intake of refugees. Many faith-based groups like HIAS have for decades relied on U.S. funding to provide lifesaving assistance. HIAS, established in 1903 as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, says it helps some 1.4 million refugees and displaced people annually, including providing meals, mental health services and legal protection. The U.S.-based group assists people around the world and helps resettle several thousand refugees each year, mostly to the United States.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjfw7hmqkx	2025-02-19T10:38:44-08:00	
Egypt announces first discovery of pharaoh's tomb in more than 10...	A joint Egyptian-British mission has identified an ancient tomb near Luxor as that of King Thutmose II, marking the first discovery of a pharaonic royal tomb in more than 100 years, Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said on Tuesday. Located west of the Valley of the Kings, Thutmose II's tomb was the last lost tomb of the kings of Egypt's 18th dynasty, and the first royal tomb discovered since King Tutankhamun's in 1922, the ministry said.Archaeologists were able to identify the tomb due to alabaster vessels found on site and inscribed with the name of King Thutmose II and his wife Queen Hatshepsut, one of a small handful of women to have ruled Egypt. They also found pieces of his funerary furniture, as well as pieces of mortar with blue inscriptions, yellow stars and religious writing, the statement said. However, due to flooding soon after the king's death, the tomb was generally not well preserved, the ministry statement added. There were indications that most of its contents had been moved, and work to recover them was under way, it said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1jaz3791e	2025-02-19T10:36:53-08:00

Hostages Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas are dead, and their bodies w...	Shiri and her red-haired children, who have become one of the most prominent symbols of Hamas' cruelty, were included on the list of the killed hostages who will be handed over by Hamas; Yarden Bibas, their extended family and the entire nation hoped and prayed that they would return alive The entire country was shocked on October 7 by the photo of Shiri Bibas, 32, hugging her two red-haired sons, 9-month-old Kfir and 4-year-old Ariel, as they were surrounded in Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas terrorists who were leading them to captivity in Gaza. All three were declared kidnapped, as was husband and father Yarden Bibas, who was released from captivity on February 1 after 486 days - and the entire country and world hoped for the return of all the family members alive. Now that hope has been dashed with the announcement that the bodies of Shiri and her children will be repatriated on Thursday morning. The Bibas family on Wednesday night issued a clarification after the announcement that their loved ones bodies would be returned saying that 'we should receive the bitter news, if it comes, in the customary way after all identification procedures are completed. We ask that we not eulogize our loved ones until there is confirmation after final identification.' Hamas claimed in late November 2023 that Shiri and her two children were not alive. The terrorist organization did not provide any proof of this, and Israel did not signal at any point that there was an indication of this. Among other things, it was claimed that they were being held by another organization. Hamas later even released a video of Yarden Bibas from captivity, after allegedly being informed of their deaths. The IDF spokesman then responded to the harsh video and the terrorist organization's claims, saying that 'Hamas continues to act in a cruel and inhumane manner. The IDF is examining the reliability of the information.' Following the announcement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assured the family members that the matter was being investigated and that they would be updated on any information on the subject. News sites around the world followed the images of the children who remained captive, as well as the images of the reunion of the kidnapped who returned with their families as part of the first hostage deal less than two months after the Hamas attack. In February 2024, the IDF showed the Bibas family a security camera video showing Shiri and the two children in eastern Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on the day of the kidnapping. The three were recorded in the video while still alive, however, even when the footage was shown to the family, it was not clear what their condition was at that time - 136 days after their kidnapping. IDF spokesman Brigadier General Daniel Hagari revealed the video to the public after receiving the family's consent, and clarified at the time: 'We are very concerned about the condition and well-being of Shiri and the children.' Hagari also revealed that the family members were kidnapped by an organization called 'Lords of the Desert' but clarified: 'Hamas is responsible and holds all the details related to the Bibas family. It is the address for this family.' Earlier this month, Yarden Bibas was released from captivity, as part of the fourth round of first phase of the second hostage deal , along with the hostages Ofer Calderon and Keith Siegel. At the reception point in the Re'im camp, he was reunited with his father Eli and his sister Ofri Bibas-Levi, who hugged and kissed him. About a week later, Yarden issued a statement referring to Shiri and their children Ariel and Kfir: 'Unfortunately, my family has not yet returned to me. They are still there. My light is still there and as long as they are there, everything is dark here.' A few days later, when he was released from Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer, his family said that 'the road to rehabilitation is still long, and it will not be complete until Shiri, Ariel, Kfir and all the hostages return home.' In an interview with Ynet, Yarden's sister, Ofri, shared that his first question after his release was about the fate of his wife and children, and referred to her brother's video released by Hamas: 'Ever since the terrorists told him about Shiri and the children, he has been trying to understand if this is psychological terrorism.' Regarding his acclimatization, she said that 'he is still there, on October 7,' and about his days in captivity, she shared that he 'slept most of the time and woke up for food, if it came.' In an earlier interview with Ynet's 'Headline' podcast, Ofri said that the family planned to move to live in the north of the country within a few months. 'They saw that life on the Gaza border was already affecting them, the anxiety was penetrating them. They didn't want to raise the children under this pressure and started thinking about the north. Since we moved to the moshav in the Golan, we had been sending them photos of houses all the time, but they didn't have time to move.' Kfir was kidnapped from his home when he was only 9 months old. On January 18, 2024, people across the country, and even around the world, marked his first birthday . At the event, which was dubbed 'The Saddest Birthday in the World,' several child stars appeared and dedicated their well-known songs to Kfir and Ariel. 'I went to Google to see what a child is supposed to do from the age of nine months to a year. He is supposed to see many colors, but instead he only sees darkness,' said Yossi Schneider, Shiri's cousin, at the time. ( Photo: Roy Rubinstein, Roy Castro ) Less than a month earlier, hundreds of orange balloons were released at the end of a children's literature ceremony for 2023, dedicated to the Bibas family, and especially to the brothers Kfir and Ariel. The balloons were released at the end of the ceremony, as singer Yuval Dayan finished singing 'Until You Come Back.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ofri Bibas-Levy told Ynet at the time that 'We didn't believe we would be in this fight for so long. We walk around all day with pain and sadness that is always there, and every now and then it rises and overflows.' Bibas-Levy later wondered: 'What is this reality that we are here and they are there, maybe in an underground tunnel? It's a nightmare and unrealistic and our strength is running out. But who are we in the face of their fight there?' Almost nine months after her family was kidnapped, Ofri gave birth to her third son, Afik. She discovered she was pregnant a few days after October 7, the day the terrorists kidnapped Yardan. 'My baby symbolizes nine months that have passed,' said Bibas Levy at the time, when she participated in the mothers' march for the release of the kidnapped. In a conversation with Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth, she said: 'Throughout my pregnancy, I hoped they would be here by the time it ended and I gave birth. By the eighth month, or a little before, I came to terms with the fact that they probably wouldn't be. After the birth, there was a small hope they might somehow be there for the bris. My mind is never fully where I am; no joy is complete, something is always missing. When I left the delivery room, I wanted to send messages to everyone, but I had nothing to send to the family group because they’re not there. Now it's just me, Dad and Mom.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjukyj7q1g	2025-02-19T10:28:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/06/10/B1eXjc2VBC/B1eXjc2VBC_9_260_760_765_0_small.jpg
Herzog: 'The days ahead will be especially heart-wrenching'	President Isaac Herzog, speaking on Wednesday evening at the Great Synagogue in Rome siad of the announcement of the names of the dead hostages that will be returned on Thursday: 'Yesterday, it became apparent to all of us that the days ahead will be especially heart-wrenching. They will hold both pain, grief, and sorrow—as the bodies of hostages are returned to us tomorrow—but also relief and even hope, as living hostages, our brothers, are freed on Shabbat. But these heart-wrenching and overwhelming days also highlight two absolute truths. The first: it is our highest duty to bring every last one of our hostage brothers home. Every moment that they are in the hands of the terrorist monsters is a direct threat to their lives. We must use every means and every measure to bring them home urgently. Every single one of them. The second is the understanding that we really are dealing with absolute and cruel evil. Evil that murders, tortures, and kidnaps mothers and babies, motivated by a murderous jihadist ideology. Evil that butchers whole families. Evil that is continuing its crimes against humanity at these very moments.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hye11qi7ckg	2025-02-19T10:00:57-08:00

Oded Lifshitz's family issued a statement Wednesday night saying, 'These are not easy times for us, after we were informed that our beloved Oded is on the list of deceased hostages who will return to Israel tomorrow, after being kidnapped alive from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz.' It also said, 'For 502 days we hoped and prayed for a different ending, but until we receive absolute certainty, our journey will not end, and even after that we will continue to fight until the last hostage is returned. We ask the media and the public not to contact us at this time on the subject and to respect our privacy.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1cufi7qye	2025-02-19T09:57:59-08:00	
The heart of an entire country is breaking: Bodies of Kfir, Ariel...	Israel confirms the names of the dead hostages whose bodies will be repatriated on Thursday morning; The entire country was shocked on October 7 by the photo of Shiri Bibas, 32, hugging her two red-haired sons, 9-month-old Kfir and 4-year-old Ariel, as they were surrounded in Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas terrorists who were leading them to captivity in Gaza. All three were declared kidnapped, as was the father, Yarden , who was released from captivity after 486 days - and the entire public hoped for the return of all the family members alive. Now that hope has been dashed - with the announcement that their bodies will be handed over by Hamas on Thursday morning. The body of Oded Lifshiz, 84, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, also will be repatriated. Hamas claimed in late November 2023 that Shiri and her two children were dead. The terrorist organization has not provided any proof of this, and Israel has not signaled at any point that there is any real indication of this. In addition it has been claimed that they were being held by another organization. Hamas later even released a video of Yarden Bibas, while still in captivity , after allegedly being informed of their deaths. News sites around the world followed the images of the children who remained captive, as well as the images of the reunion of the kidnapped who returned with their families as part of the first hostage deal. Yizhar Lifshitz, son of Oded Lifshitz, told Ynet on Wednesday evening that the family members were informed in the afternoon by the terrorist organizations that their father would be included in the release of the four kidnapped victims. 'Until he is identified, nothing will be decided, but we are prepared for it to happen tomorrow,' he told Ynet. 'The feelings are difficult. He left alive, was kidnapped alive, and returned dead. The kibbutz was burned, the community was slaughtered, what feelings can there be? Not simple feelings,' Yitzhar said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1zwpqxcjl	2025-02-19T09:23:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/S1AaCc7qyl/S1AaCc7qyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Red Cross calls for private, dignified handover of hostages' bodi...	The Red Cross on Wednesday called for privacy and dignity ahead of the expected release of hostages' bodies from Gaza under the terms of a cease-fire. Thursday's handover is expected to include for the first time the bodies of four hostages. 'We must be clear: any degrading treatment during release operations is unacceptable,' the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a statement. The Hamas-directed hostage releases since the January 19 cease-fire have been characterised by large public ceremonies among Gaza's ruins and have come under growing criticism, including from the United Nations, which denounced the 'parading of hostages.' T he ICRC, a neutral intermediary responsible for releasing hostages and Palestinian prisoners under the terms of the ceasefire, has repeatedly called for improvements.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skfo11qq5kl	2025-02-19T08:16:17-08:00	
Trump administration freezes funding for Palestinian Authority se...	Trump’s aid freeze leaves Palestinian security forces underfunded and struggling to maintain order in the West Bank, especially as wayward factions like the Jenin Brigades lurk in the shadows, vying for influence and control The Trump administration halted funding for the Palestinian Authority's (PA) security forces as part of its efforts to freeze U.S. international aid, according to a report by The Washington Post citing American and Palestinian officials. The funding freeze comes during a challenging and complex period for the Palestinian Authority, which is struggling to maintain its rule in the West Bank while claiming it has the capacity to govern Gaza in the aftermath of the Gaza war. Palestinian Authority and Jenin Brigades clash The Palestinian security forces, characterized by chronic underfunding and a lack of support from many Palestinians, play a critical role in the PA's ability to maintain law and order in the West Bank, even if they are not always successful. The PA, led by the 89-year-old President Mahmoud Abbas, is currently only able to pay partial salaries to its employees, including members of the security forces. During Donald Trump’s first term, the U.S. stopped direct aid to the Palestinian Authority but continued funding training programs for the security forces. These exercises and courses are conducted through the U.S. Security Coordinator’s Office (USSC), which mediates between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Anwar Rajab, a spokesperson for the PA security forces, told The Post that the U.S. is considered 'a major contributor to PA projects,' including training programs for the forces. A former Israeli official, speaking anonymously to the American newspaper, said the USSC 'was not significantly affected' by the aid freeze, as 'other donors stepped in to fill the gap.' However, a Palestinian official, equivalent in rank to a lieutenant colonel, told The Post that the funding freeze has already led to cuts in some training programs. The Palestinian official noted that a planned meeting with the Americans this month, intended to assess the PA’s operation against terrorists in the Jenin refugee camp — which was halted following the Gaza war — was postponed, with no new date set. Washington also halted funding for a virtual shooting range, which the official said the PA needs because Israel does not allow it to import live ammunition for training. Although the project was nearly completed, the official stated that the PA is now seeking alternative funding sources due to the aid freeze. Biden administration’s position Former President Joe Biden has supported the return of the Palestinian Authority to power in Gaza. However, The Post noted that this move is opposed not only by Israel but also by Hamas, which expelled PA officials from Gaza and executed officers from the PA security forces. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1eufom9jl	2025-02-19T07:48:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/22/HJN8D5SrJe/HJN8D5SrJe_1_132_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Austria foils terror plot: 14-year-old ISIS supporter planned Vie...	A 14-year-old Austrian citizen of Turkish descent planned a knife attack at Vienna’s Westbahnhof station, Austrian authorities say Austrian police have arrested a 14-year-old boy suspected of planning a terrorist attack at Vienna’s Westbahnhof train station. According to the Interior Ministry, authorities found knives and extremist materials in his possession, indicating his support for the Islamic State group. The teenager, an Austrian citizen of Turkish descent, was taken into custody on Feb. 10, but authorities only announced his arrest now. The investigation began after officials detected a TikTok user spreading Islamist propaganda across multiple accounts. Police identified the suspect and, during a raid on his home, discovered jihadist literature, a flag with an Islamic oath, and handwritten instructions for making explosives. They also seized several sharp objects, including a knife with a 16.5-centimeter (6.5-inch) blade and a 7-centimeter (2.7-inch) razor. News of his arrest comes just days after a deadly terrorist attack in the Austrian town of Flach, where a Syrian extremist fatally stabbed a 14-year-old boy and wounded five others before sitting by the roadside and smiling for a photo. The attack was Austria’s deadliest since the 2020 Vienna shooting, which left four people dead. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Authorities said the Flach attacker was rapidly radicalized through TikTok videos and had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State before the attack. Just last week, Germany saw a similar Islamist-inspired attack when an Afghan asylum seeker, whose application had been rejected, drove a car into a labor protest in Munich, killing a woman and her 2-year-old daughter. He had a criminal record for drug and theft offenses, and officials later found signs of his radicalization. The recent attacks in Austria and Germany come as far-right parties in both countries experience a surge in support, partly due to their hardline stance on Muslim immigration. Germany is set to hold nationwide elections next week, where the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is expected to make significant gains. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rklkodq9yg	2025-02-19T07:43:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/HkbbsIm5Jl/HkbbsIm5Jl_1_105_1000_563_0_small.jpg

Indian delegation visits Israel: India and Israel can learn from ...	The members of the Sharaka delegation, which included military officials and leading journalists from India, expressed sympathy for Israel’s struggle for security and highlighted the extensive military cooperation between the two countries In recent years, the relationship between India and Israel has transformed from a distant diplomatic connection to a robust partnership marked by significant collaboration in trade, defense and technology. Once limited by political complexities, this evolving bond reflects shared interests in security, innovation and regional stability, signaling a new era of cooperation. Earlier this month, a delegation of leaders from Indian society traveled to Israel to visit important sites and speak to Israeli counterparts, proving that ties between the two nations extend to the personal level as well. The visit was organized by Sharaka, a nonprofit organization that aims to reshape the Middle East according to the values of dialogue and cooperation. Devang Bhatt, head of the major Indian news channel GTPL, aid he was excited when a representative from Sharaka asked him to join the delegation because he recognized the importance of educating younger Indians about the reality in Israel. After this recent visit, his first to Israel, he’s now planning on devoting one show a month on his channel to the situation in Israel. Many of the delegation members described significant parallels between the situations in Israel and in India. For Lt. Gen. Satish Dua, who served in the Indian army for nearly four decades, a pin on his uniform calls to mind those similarities. The pin is shaped like the leaf of a chinar tree, a common species in India’s conflict-ridden Jammu and Kashmir region. 'You know, Jammu and Kashmir, we have a situation nowadays with Pakistan, and we’re dealing with terrorists, as are you,' Dua said. 'So I was the core commander there. That means all the army, all the paramilitary forces there in Kashmir Valley. And the emblem that the formation, the core headquarters, the whole core that is adopted there is a chinar leaf. So that’s why I wear it here proudly.' He said that both Israel and India are dealing with 'difficult neighbors' — in India’s case, Pakistan, which has been a significant source of terrorism. India admires the way Israel has handled both enemy states and nonstate proxy groups, Dua said. 'There’s a lot to learn from the Israel Defense Forces for our forces. And I’m sure there are some lessons that your forces can also take away from our forces, because we also have been in the same, ever since our independence, we’ve had some kind of insurgency or the other,' he said. The Shakara trip was the first visit to Israel for many of the participants, including Lt. Gen. Rajendra Ramrao Nimbhorkar. But as a longtime officer in the Indian military, Nimbhorkar was no stranger to Israel’s military history. 'This being a very militarily dependent country, we in the Indian army have studied various wars and campaigns which the Israeli army has fought,' he said. He recognized 'a lot of similarities between India and Israel,' especially in regard to Jammu and Kashmir, where he served for 17 years. Learning about Israel’s military history is actually part of the military curriculum for India, Dua said. For that reason, 'there is a great deal of awareness, especially among the Indian army officers, about what has been the military history of Israel,' he said. One of the highlights of Dua’s trip was visiting the border with Gaza. 'It was very nice to learn about the Gaza border, because we have similarities in the India-Pakistan border, because the way the terrain is, though our terrain is much higher mountainous terrain, but the similarities of a porous border and terrorists getting across using the sensors,' he said. 'We actually use sensors that we actually procured from Israel. We also use the same in our border fencing.' Those are just a few examples of military cooperation between Israel and India. The Drishti-10 Starliner used by the Indian military, for example, is a variant of an Israeli drone. Bhatt noted that his own news company relies on Israeli systems. 'In each corner of the world, they have to get support from Israel. Even I’m talking about my own company,' he said. 'My company has 10.5 million subscribers and the security system we have got from Israel only.' Dua said that India relies on Israeli weapons to fill any 'critical voids.' As far back as three decades ago, when he was serving as colonel on the border with Pakistan, the first handheld thermal imagers the military had were sourced from Israel, Dua said. 'The best measure of our support and trust in each other is the fact that there have been a couple of times when we needed something very critically, very urgently because of the operational situation. In fact, the conflict was ongoing, and Israel came to our help,' he said. 'You know, sometimes it takes, there are long gestation periods to actually get defense equipment and weapons and ammunition. But when we needed it, we got it in real quick time.' India and Israel’s militaries also carry out regular joint exercises and delegations to each other’s countries, Dua added. 'Both our armies, that is India and Israeli army or armed forces, are involved in combating the same scourge. So there is again a lot of give and take,' he said. 'I’m sure that India and Israel will only enhance their cooperation in the new emerging fields, especially in the world of cyber and space,' Dua continued. 'Here, Israel has a lot of strengths. India also has some strengths in the software skills, but in the cyber world, the Israeli capabilities are fairly unmatched, and we look forward to cooperating in that.' The members of the delegation all expressed that the Indian people have a positive view of Israel. 'Forget about Indian politicians, forget about Indian media, but once we are on the ground, Indians are in favor of Israel,' Bhatt said. Snehesh Alex Philip, a journalist at ThePrint, India’s largest and fastest growing digital news agency, said that one challenge in terms of communicating about Israel is that young Indian news consumers don’t have patience for involved stories. 'It’s like a quick two-minute noodles, right? They want everything in, in just a matter of two minutes,' he said. Philip described the Indian population as supportive of Israel overall. 'As far as the whole issue of Israel, Hamas, and this region is concerned, I think back in India, there’s a huge support as far as Israel is concerned,' he said. Neha Khanna, deputy editor and senior anchor with India’s TV9 network, said that Indians’ experience with terrorism makes the population sympathetic to Israelis’ struggles. 'We had horrific attacks in Mumbai in 2008, for instance, perhaps one of the worst attacks, if not the worst, on Indian soil,' she said. 'And what happened in Israel on October 7 was something like that.' But alongside that sympathy is a sense that the war needs to come to an end, Khanna said. 'I think a lot of people believed that the war had gone on for too long and just too many people had died,' she said. 'A lot of Palestinians have suffered; too many lives have been lost in Gaza. So, you know, one really hopes that calm heads can prevail and that a lasting peace can be found.' 'I have covered this war extensively and brought news about it to my Indian viewers, not just in India, but also abroad. And I have, in fact, had multiple Israeli guests on my shows to talk about various dimensions of the war,' she said. 'And I think we can all agree that it’s been a very challenging situation for Israel, for the Palestinians, and for the Middle East and indeed the entire world, because everybody just kept wondering if this was going to, in fact, degenerate into some sort of a regional conflagration. I’m glad it hasn’t got to that point, and I certainly hope that the cease-fire holds. But I can tell you that pretty much like everyone else, the people of India are watching this situation very closely with a lot of interest.' She noted that India supports a two-state solution, which raises questions about President Donald Trump’s plans to relocate Gazans and support Israeli presence in the West Bank, both of which seem to preclude a two-state solution. 'Indians, as much as anyone else, want to see a return of peace and normalcy in the region. And, at the end of the day, if the people of India believe that we need to see peaceful coexistence and cohabitation between the two peoples, then I guess what is being suggested by President Trump is not really likely to find many supporters, could in fact cause alarm,' she said. Philip, too, highlighted the importance of achieving a two-state solution. 'Without a two-state solution, I don’t see any long-lasting peace that is going to be there. No matter how much you can militarily take over a region, there has to be a conflict resolution. It can’t be a prolonging of conflict,' he said. He did praise Trump for his actions so far, noting that the president applied pressure to both Hamas and to Israel to reach a deal. 'Had Trump not won the elections, had Trump not come in, I don’t think the cease-fire would have really worked out,' he said. Philip also noted the importance of the Abraham Accords, normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab nations signed during Trump’s first term. But he said that Israel’s increasingly normalized place in the Middle East was likely one of the catalysts for the October 7 attacks. Like Khanna, Philip described the conflict between Israel and Hamas as a war fought for a just cause but one that has gone on too long. 'What Hamas did was nothing but a pure form of terrorism. Israel had every right to hit back at Hamas, which it did, but the war prolonged too long,' he said. 'There were a lot of civilian casualties that came up. There was the whole question of the hostages that were there.' Dua described the ongoing hostage crisis as a 'damned if you do, damned if you don’t' situation of a kind with which India is unfortunately familiar. 'We’ve had an aircraft that was hijacked in 1999, taken to Kandahar in Afghanistan, and we were told to release a few dreaded terrorists languishing in our jails, in our prisons,' Dua said. 'One of them, Masood Azhar, eventually formed the Jaish-e-Mohammed, whose signature tactics is suicide squads, and they’ve started perfecting that technology, and they’ve harmed not only India, even Pakistan and other places. So what I’m trying to say is that it’s a tough call that Israel has had to make.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He said that the countries of the world ought to learn from each other about terrorist negotiations, but not necessarily establish hard and fast rules for such negotiation that all will abide by. 'If you formulate a few bigger countries, U.S., India, Israel and other countries who are affected by terrorism, we sit down and formulate some rules. How can we hold a signatory to that? Because the circumstances in which that country will be called upon to negotiate with a particular situation will be different,' he said. 'To my mind, I don’t think it’s going to be an easy thing. A better way would be to learn from each other’s experiences, to form their own national policies, and then act on it.' Nimbhorkar commended Israel for its response to the October 7 attacks. 'Whatever the solution Israel has done, I think is the correct solution,' he said, explaining that Hamas will now think twice about committing more terror attacks. He called on the international community to more harshly condemn Hamas and to support Israel’s response. Relocating Gazans to neighboring countries, as Trump has proposed, 'is desirable, but I think it’s not practical,' Nimbhorkar said, noting that doing such a thing might require a ground invasion into Egypt. 'Personally, I feel Israel should not let go the control of the Gaza Strip,' he said. 'Because the moment you let it go, then again you come back to square one. And therefore, after that, the rest of the thing, as you say, giving a soft touch, subsequently can be done. First, you have to have an iron hand and then have a soft touch.' That duality was also present in the advice Bhatt had to offer to Israel. He said he would like Israelis to internalize the Hindu concept of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which means 'the world is one family.' 'Even Narendra Modi, prime minister, whenever he goes to any country, he delivers the same message, Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,' Bhatt explained But that message must be taken together with another piece of Indian wisdom. 'There is a god, Krishna. He always says, whenever an enemy is there, then please use your weapon,' Bhatt said.

I’m OK, don’t worry, I love you': Nimrod Cohen’s message to his ...	As the first phase of the hostage deal concludes, families of those still in captivity express growing concern over delays in negotiations; Saturday’s upcoming release will include six hostages, leaving 59 hostages behind in Gaza Yehuda Cohen, the father of abducted soldier Nimrod Cohen, said on Wednesday that he received a message from his son through a relative of one of the recently released hostages. 'I’m OK, don’t worry, I love you,' Nimrod conveyed through the freed hostage. Nimrod is not expected to be released during the first stage of the deal. In an interview with Ynet last month, Yehuda shared: 'Over a year ago, we met with two pilots who had been released from captivity in Egyptian and Syrian prisons. They told us that while they were in captivity, they worried about their families worrying about them,' he recounted. 'I believe this is also the case with Nimrod. Nimrod was with two of the hostages who were released in one of the last rounds — it gives us some insight into the conditions in which he is being held. They walked on their own feet, which gives me hope that my son will return to us in the same way. I know him; he’s young and strong. I trust him to hold on and endure.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The father added: 'I know there are hostages who are chained and have been abused. As for Nimrod, I know he doesn’t see daylight and is restricted in terms of food. As long as Hamas has an interest in returning them to us looking well, they will take care of them — for appearances sake. Hamas has more of an interest in keeping them alive than Netanyahu does. They’re not keeping them for humanitarian reasons but because they have a high price — they’ll get more prisoners in exchange for them.' As the first stage of the hostage deal nears its conclusion, the families of those still in captivity are increasingly concerned about delays in negotiations for the next phase. 'We must accelerate efforts and bring everyone home in one phase. We cannot allow this reality to become routine. Every passing day feels like an eternity for those who are still there,' said Vered Ben Baruch, the grandmother of abducted soldier Idan Alexander, with deep pain. On Saturday, the following hostages are expected to be released: Eliya Cohen, Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, Tal Shoham, Avera Mengistu, and Hisham al-Sayed. Prior to that, on Thursday, the bodies four killed hostages are expected to be released. The remaining four hostages, believed to be dead, from the first stage will be released next week. By the end of the first stage, 59 hostages will remain in captivity, including at least 28 killed hostages. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skbr8uxqje	2025-02-19T06:38:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/01/07/rJelb7uOp/rJelb7uOp_1_51_480_271_0_small.jpg

IDF examining whether 'foreign elements' working to sabotage rela...	In wake of reports that Israel fears a violation of the peace agreement with Egypt, the IDF is investigating whether interested parties are connected to publications intended to sabotage relations between the two countries; In Cairo, there were protests over videos in which an IDF spokesman is seen thanking Sisi in Arabic for assistance in the war in Gaza and Lebanon; Israel says it is a fake The IDF is examining whether regional stakeholders are behind publications intended to sabotage relations and incite tensions between Israel and Egypt , Ynet has learned. Israeli sources are convinced that stakeholders are trying to undermine relations between the countries, and are therefore promoting false information about Egypt's preparations for war with Israel, using influencers. In addition, Ynet has learned that in recent days Israel received a protest from senior Egyptian officials, following several videos distributed on social media, in which an alleged IDF spokesman is seen thanking Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in Arabic for the assistance he is providing to Israel in its war in Gaza and Lebanon. Egyptian officials have appealed to official channels for an explanation. The IDF clarified that these are fake videos produced using AI technologies, and even issued an official denial, calling it 'Suspicious attempts to distribute fake videos through dubious and false accounts. ... Be vigilant and aware of these attempts.' In recent days, additional false videos have been distributed, including some which show military exercises carried out by the Egyptian army in 2017 and 2020, and which were presented as if they were taking place now, as well as photos allegedly taken in Sinai. Tensions between the countries intensified following statements by Israel's ambassador to Washington, Yechiel Leiter, who sharply accused Egypt of 'deliberately violating the peace agreements with Israel,' and even added that it was building military bases in the Sinai, in an address late last month in a meeting with the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. A video of the remarks surfaced earlier this week. Shortly after Leiter's remarks were published, World Jewish Congress President Ron Lauder arrived with extraordinary speed in Cairo for a meeting held at the Presidential Palace. The meeting was attended by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Egyptian Intelligence Chief General Hassan Rashad. According to a statement from the presidential office in Cairo, the conversation focused on Egypt’s efforts to promote regional peace and establish a Palestinian state. Sisi made it clear that he expects 'all parties involved, including Israel, to act with full responsibility to ensure that the cease-fire lasts.' Lauder, for his part, praised Sisi for his 'responsible leadership.' Although Leiter's remarks were deleted from the Internet, they were published by American and Israeli media outlets, which emphasized that this was the first time that a senior Israeli official had accused Egypt of such a blatant violation of the peace agreements. Since October 7, 2023, the IDF has been more vigilant about regional threats.

They believe that the purpose of spreading the rumors may be to increase fear and panic among the Israeli public, which has already been traumatized since the October 7 massacre. 'From our investigations, these rumors did not originate from the Egyptian side. When Cairo wants to convey messages, they know how to do it well,' an Israeli official said. The official added that the IDF’s main concern is not the border with Egypt, but rather the eastern border with Jordan, given Iran’s efforts to destabilize Amman and strengthen Palestinian elements in the country. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s11rnwm9je	2025-02-19T05:32:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/Hkza4JP75Jg/Hkza4JP75Jg_0_708_1080_608_0_small.jpg

A senior Hamas official told AFP on Wednesday that the Palestinian militant group was prepared to release all remaining hostages in a single swap during the second phase of the Gaza truce. 'We have informed the mediators that Hamas is ready to release all hostages in one batch during the second phase of the agreement, rather than in stages, as in the current first phase,' said Taher al-Nunu.

PMO: Early release of hostages result of Netanyahu’s firm stance	The Prime Minister’s Office pushed back against claims by negotiators that a change in the team handling the hostage deal had no impact on the revised terms of the agreement. 'The claim by 'negotiation sources' that Hamas was responsible for expediting the release is a new peak of absurdity and an echo of Hamas propaganda,' the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement. 'Two weeks ago, the prime minister set the goal of securing the release of the remaining living hostages from the first phase in a single wave.

Suez Canal Authority Chairman Osama Rabie said on Wednesday that the Red Sea crisis did not create a sustainable route to replace the canal, adding that there were positive indicators for the return of stability in the region. Iran-backed Houthi militants have attacked vessels in the Red Sea area since November 2023, disrupting global shipping lanes by forcing vessels to avoid the nearby Suez Canal and reroute trade around Africa, raising the costs for insurers. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said in December the disruption cost Egypt around $7 billion in revenue from the Suez Canal in 2024. That's a drop of more than 60% from its revenue a year before from the canal, Sisi said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy1ochxc1x	2025-02-19T03:28:38-08:00

Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar said group's operative killed in a drone strike on his car in the South Lebanon village of Aita al-Shaab Reports from Lebanon on Wednesday afternoon said that one person was killed in an IDF strike on a vehicle in the country’s south. The Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar reported that the strike was carried out by an Israeli drone in the village of Aita al-Shaab. The vehicle targeted was carrying a suspected Hezbollah operative, marking the first such strike since the Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon while maintaining a presence at five military outposts near the border fence. Later, reports from Lebanon identified the victim as Mohammad Sarour, the son of the mayor of Aita al-Shaab, who was targeted outside his home. On Tuesday, the IDF completed the withdrawal of its forces from the area where it had remained for the past two and a half months—during the implementation of the cease-fire that officially took effect following the pullback between Israel and Hezbollah.

Pro-Palestinians clash with Jewish residents in Brooklyn's Boroug...	Palestinian activist Pal-Awda organizes protest yelling Zionists go to hell'; break police lines in violent confrontation; Local congressment says it was a 'deliberate harassment of one of the largest Orthodox communities in the U.S' Tensions escalated in Brooklyn's Borough Park on Tuesday night as an anti-Israel protest turned into a heated confrontation with local Jewish residents, leading to at least one arrest. The demonstration, organized by the activist group Pal-Awda, was aimed at a real estate event that protesters claimed was involved in selling Palestinian land to Israel. Dozens of protesters gathered in a designated area set up by police, while across the street, dozens of local residents and pro-Israel activists held Israeli flags and responded with counter-chants. Clashes broke out after some protesters crossed police barriers and approached the Jewish and pro-Israel group, leading to pushing, shouting, and physical confrontations. NYPD officers intervened, arresting at least one demonstrator. Videos from the scene showed protesters chanting 'Zionists go to hell' and 'settlers go back home,' with some raising their hands in a triangular gesture associated with Hamas. Counter-protesters shouted back 'terrorists' and 'Nazis go home.' The demonstration, which lasted over an hour in freezing temperatures, eventually dispersed as police maintained a heavy presence. Some protesters continued shouting slogans as they walked toward a nearby subway station, while local residents observed from the sidewalks. Pro-Israeli New York lawmakers swiftly condemned the protest. Congressman Ritchie Torres wrote on X: 'The pro-Hamas mob that vowed to ‘flood’ Borough Park quickly descended into violence. Violence is not a bug of the ‘Free Palestine’ movement—it is a feature.'

Senior official accuses Mossad, Shin Bet chiefs for 'only made co...	The unamed official claimed that the change in the negotiating team removing security chiefs and replacing them with allied minister directly resulted in the planned release of six hostages on Saturday A senior Israeli official on Wednesday praised Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to sideline Mossad director David Barnea and Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar from the hostage negotiation team, claiming it directly contributed to the expedited release of six hostages on Saturday. The official said that the successful agreement to free all live hostges named in the first phase of the cease-fire deal, along with the planned return of the bodies of fallen hostages on Thursday—which had already been scheduled as part of the agreement—was a result of Netanyahu’s decision to restructure the team. The new negotiation team is led by Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a close confidant of Netanyahu. 'The new team changed the dynamics and led a true negotiation instead of simply making concessions,' the official said. 'They also ended the practice of biased, regular briefings against the prime minister and political leadership, which only encouraged Hamas to harden its stance and raise its demands.' Netanyahu had previously criticized the security chiefs and their team in private discussions, accusing them of mishandling the talks. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Netanyahu appointed Dermer to lead negotiations for the second phase of the hostage deal, working alongside Steve Witkoff, special envoy for Middle East affairs under U.S. President Donald Trump. Until now, negotiations had been led by Bar and Barnea. While Barnea will remain involved, the new team also includes Gal Hirsch, Israel’s coordinator for hostage and missing persons affairs, and a former deputy Shin Bet chief, identified only as 'M.' Opposition Leader Lapid: 'A Cowardly and Completely False Statement' Opposition leader Yair Lapid criticized the Prime Minister’s Office following the senior official’s remarks. 'This statement raises serious concerns about Netanyahu’s judgment,' Lapid said. 'It is cowardly and a complete lie. Netanyahu keeps blaming others for his failures and is exploiting the hostage families for political gain,' Lapid said. 'Anyone working for him should know that, sooner or later, they will be publicly sacrificed for half a headline. This is a matter of life and death, yet he is focused on claiming credit. He should stop hiding behind anonymous briefings and focus on bringing all the hostages home.' Following Tuesday’s announcement that six hostages—Omer Ankret, Omer Shem Tov, Tal Shahem, Elia Cohen, Avera Mengistu, and Hisham al-Sayed—would be released on Saturday, an Israeli official described it as 'a significant achievement for Netanyahu, carried out in full coordination with the United States.' The official added: 'The prime minister once again succeeded in expediting the release process, securing an agreement to bring back all the living hostages from the first phase this week, along with the return of the bodies of fallen hostages. If this agreement is implemented, Israel will have completed Phase A of the deal—an achievement that few believed possible.' Preparations for the Second Phase The official noted that as part of the negotiations, Israel had approved the entry of 'a very limited quantity' of mobile shelters and heavy equipment into Gaza. 'This does not affect the feasibility of implementing Trump’s voluntary migration plan or creating a new reality in Gaza, which Prime Minister Netanyahu is fully committed to,' the official claimed. Israel is now preparing for negotiations on the second phase of the cease-fire, which, according to the official, 'will focus on the political conditions for ending the war.' Dermer will lead these discussions with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. 'Israel will present its security demands in the negotiations, based on the war objectives set by the security cabinet. If Hamas refuses to comply, Israel will resume military operations in Gaza with full force, backed by the Trump administration, a replenished stockpile of munitions, fresh troops, and an entirely new combat strategy,' the official said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy6uge7cke	2025-02-19T02:47:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/HJPvoQXcJg/HJPvoQXcJg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Military indicts reservists for severe abuse of Nukhba terrorist;...	According to the indictment, the accused - among them two officers - subjected a prisoner to extreme violence, including stabbing him in the buttocks with a sharp object that penetrated near his rectum, resulting in severe injuries Five IDF soldiers in the reserves were indicted on Thursday for aggravated abuse and severe bodily harm against a Palestinian security detainee at the Sde Teiman detention camp. Two of the accused are reserve officers, holding the ranks of lieutenant colonel and captain, while the remaining three are of lower ranks. The lieutenant colonel served as a team commander in 'Force 100.' Initially, there were suspicions of sexual offenses by those involved, but the indictment makes no mention of such allegations. According to the indictment, the accused subjected the detainee to extreme violence, including stabbing him in the buttocks with a sharp object that penetrated near his rectum. The indictment further states that the abuse resulted in severe injuries, including fractured ribs, a punctured lung, and internal rectal tears. The incident occurred on July 5, 2024, while the reservists were serving at the detention facility. They had been instructed to search the detainee, who was handcuffed, shackled, and blindfolded with a cloth when they led him to the search area. 'The investigation gathered extensive evidence, including detailed medical documentation and authentic security camera footage from the detention facility,' the military said in a statement. 'IDF soldiers and commanders operate in accordance with the law and the army’s values, and any exceptional incidents or suspicions of criminal behavior are addressed accordingly.' The indictment says two reservists forced the detainee against a wall, lifted his cuffed hands upward, and pressed them against the surface while the others stood nearby. Moments later, the detainee was seen on the floor, writhing in pain, with the accused standing around him, occasionally bending over him. Over the course of approximately 15 minutes, the reservists allegedly kicked the detainee, stomped on him, stood on his body, shoved him, including with a baton, dragged him across the floor, and used a Taser on him—including on his head. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Additionally, the indictment states that during the attack, the detainee’s blindfold fell off, after which one of the accused stabbed him in the buttocks with a sharp object, causing a rectal tear. Another reservist then ordered the detainee to put a baton in his mouth. The abuse continued throughout and after this assault. According to the indictment, 'Throughout the ordeal, the detainee cried out in pain.' It further states that two of the reservists led the detainee to a mattress in the detention area, where one of them pulled his shirt down over his pants to cover his buttocks. Soon after, the detainee began bleeding from his wounds. About an hour later, he reported difficulty breathing and a headache. Several hours after the attack, detention facility staff noticed significant bleeding on his pants, prompting medics to rush him to the on-site clinic. A doctor then ordered his immediate transfer to a hospital. The military prosecution said that the detainee suffered severe bodily harm, including fractures in seven ribs, a punctured left lung, a rectal tear, and multiple injuries to his body and face. Due to the stabbing, he required emergency surgery, which involved a colostomy (diverting the colon to an external stoma) and the insertion of a chest drain. He also received blood transfusions and was hospitalized under extended medical supervision. After about three and a half months, he underwent another procedure to reverse the colostomy. Defense Attorneys: 'The Blood Libel Has Collapsed' 'The blood libel against these soldiers—accusing them of gang rape and sodomy—has completely collapsed,' Defense attorneys, Avi Amiram and Lior Porat, from the Military Defense Counsel, said. 'This slander, along with malicious leaks and a falsified, ‘doctored’ video, caused immense damage to our client, to all IDF soldiers, and to Israel’s security. Not to mention, it recklessly harmed our hostages held by Hamas terrorists.' Regarding the remaining charges of aggravated abuse and severe bodily harm, they said, 'During the pretrial hearing, we presented compelling arguments refuting these allegations, and we have no doubt that once the facts emerge in court, these charges, too, will be dismissed. The indictment was rushed through just a day after we requested the military prosecution to delay proceedings until the source of the severe leaks was investigated—leaks that could have significantly influenced the investigation and those making decisions in the case.' Attorneys Adi Keidar, Moshe Polsky, and Nati Rom, who represent two of the accused on behalf of the Honenu legal organization, said the indictment marks another disgraceful low for the military prosecution and is a stain on Israel’s judicial system. 'Despite our thorough pretrial hearing proving there was no basis for the outrageous sexual allegations initially made against the defendants, and despite the stark difference between the indictment’s details and the initial accusations of rape and extreme violence that tarnished their reputations, we still believe this indictment should never have been filed. A proper legal system would have rejected this case outright, as the investigation was biased, tainted by leaks, and involved coercing a vile terrorist into filing a complaint against our heroic soldiers.' Attorney Efraim Damari, who represents another defendant called for an independent commission to ivestigate the legal process. 'This is not a case of ‘much ado about nothing’—it’s far worse. The way this indictment was filed requires an immediate independent investigative commission, today—not tomorrow,' he said. 'This commission must examine all those involved in this disgraceful legal process, from the attorney general and state prosecutor to the military advocate general and anyone else connected to this corrupt investigation. Who will compensate Israel, the IDF, and our brave soldiers for this irreparable damage? Who will repair the harm done to national security by the reckless publication of this case as a so-called ‘rape by our heroic soldiers’?' Protests and Political Fallout The arrest of the reservists sparked widespread outrage, leading dozens of protesters—including coalition Knesset members—to storm a military base in southern Israel. Later that day, another unprecedented breach occurred when a large group of demonstrators forced their way into the military court complex in Beit Lid. Outgoing-IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi swiftly condemned the intrusion into the Shde Teiman base and the resulting chaos, calling it 'a severe and illegal act.' He stated: 'This behavior is entirely unacceptable. We are in a time of war, and such actions endanger national security. I fully support the military prosecution and investigative authorities in thoroughly examining every incident that comes to their attention, regardless of rank or role. These investigations safeguard our soldiers at home and abroad while upholding the IDF’s values. They are conducted with full respect for our troops, whom we, as their commanders, are responsible for.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant took several hours to respond to the unrest. 'I have the utmost appreciation for the soldiers carrying out the complex and critical mission of detaining Hamas terrorists—despicable criminals whom we will bring to justice with the harshest measures. The IDF will continue operating within the law, Gallant said. 'We must allow the proper authorities to conduct their investigations while respecting our soldiers. Even in times of anger, the law applies to everyone—we do not storm IDF bases, and we do not break the laws of the State of Israel.' Minutes after Gallant’s statement, the Prime Minister’s Office released a statement condemning the base breach: 'Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calls for immediate calm in Shde Teiman and strongly condemns the intrusion into an IDF base.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryjumq7cje	2025-02-19T01:46:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/11/r111iogaD0/r111iogaD0_0_110_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Israeli Navy’s new missile ships in an expanding battlefield	INS Nitzachon missile ship features stealth technology that reduces radar signature, making it appear lightly armed at first glance while advanced weapjonry such as Iron Dome aerial defense systems is revealed only in launch Thousands of kilometers separate the Israeli Navy’s missile ships, requiring Flotilla 3 Commander Col. A. to simultaneously hold a satellite communication device with one hand while speaking with a patrol crew near Syria with the other. As the Israeli military establishes five new outposts along the Lebanese border, the navy is tightening its grip on Hezbollah from the west, operating with full freedom to surveil, observe, and strike. In recent months, Israeli Navy vessels have played a central role in the military’s enforcement strikes in Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah infrastructure and operatives with precision fire from formidable Sa’ar 6-class corvettes. Weighing 2,000 tons, these are the navy’s largest and most advanced ships. During a special operation in September to destroy an underground missile production site in Masyaf, Syria, the missile boat flotilla played a key role in clearing the way and providing remote cover for Israeli Air Force units. Throughout the sensitive operation, the ships launched attacks deep inside Syria from distances of over 100 kilometers, securing safe passage for Israeli commando forces. Since the October 7 massacre, the Navy’s operational scope has quadrupled. It has intercepted dozens of attempts to target Israel’s offshore gas rigs with drones and missiles launched from Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq. Additionally, it has carried out daily strikes in support of ground forces in Gaza, launched hundreds of attacks against Hezbollah, and even neutralized 15 Syrian naval vessels while crippling military ports in Tartus and Latakia. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: It has also been engaged in countering the Houthi threat from Yemen, an ongoing challenge for Israel. Amid the fighting, the navy successfully integrated four new German-made corvettes into operational service. Looking ahead, it is preparing to receive Reshef-class ships, recently approved for production, which will replace aging Sa’ar 4.5-class vessels in about two years. Patrolling the Lebanese Front The Lebanese town of Naqoura, located in the western sector near the Israeli border, is hidden from view due to the region’s topography. However, its buildings are clearly visible from navy missile ships patrolling kilometers offshore. Recently, Israeli forces from the 146th Division withdrew from the area as the Lebanese army moved south. These troops remain under constant naval cover, even in deeper inland areas with no direct line of sight. 'We’ve hit reset with Hezbollah, collecting new intelligence and refreshing our target database, even from the sea,' Col. A. told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth. One of the navy’s newest missile ships, the INS Nitzachon, stands six stories tall. Throughout the war, all types of missile boat weaponry have been deployed, including the cutting-edge and highly expensive ALRAD missiles, which cost tens of millions of shekels per unit. 'One of our greatest achievements in this war has been protecting Israel’s energy independence,' said Col. A. 'Gas production from offshore rigs never stopped. Had they been hit, Israel would have experienced widespread power outages.' He noted that unlike the 2006 Lebanon War, cargo shipments to Haifa continued uninterrupted. 'That’s not something to take for granted. Hezbollah has significantly upgraded its arsenal since 2006, but our missile boats are executing both powerful defenses and lethal offensives simultaneously.' A Stealthy Naval Force The missile ships’ weaponry remains mostly concealed. These vessels feature stealth technology that reduces their radar signature, making them appear lightly armed at first glance, with only a 76mm cannon up front and two missile batteries at the rear. However, the ships were designed by German engineers to hide their advanced weaponry, including special Iron Dome launchers, inside the hull, revealing them only during launch sequences. This stealth capability helps evade enemy radar detection. INS Nitzachon also employs state-of-the-art electronic warfare systems, with a powerful 360-degree radar that remains stationary, unlike older rotating models, and can detect launches as far away as Turkey. 'Our ship is like a microcosm of the air force, equipped with an air control unit, Iron Dome, and deadly weaponry, all at sea,' the flotilla commander explained. Inside the ship’s Combat Information Center, dimly lit screens flicker with orange, green, and red indicators. The room is divided into three sections—detection, defense, and offense—where 19- and 20-year-old female operators monitor the battlespace. In contrast, similar positions in Western navies, such as in France or the United States, are typically manned by seasoned personnel in their 30s or 40s. 'When a shift commander steps down from the bridge, their eyes take a minute or two to adjust to the light or darkness. That’s a long time in combat,' Col. A. explained. The ship’s exercises highlight just how crowded the skies and waters of the Mediterranean have become. If an unidentified airborne target suddenly appears, operators must first classify it, confirm its identity, and then determine the best response—whether to engage from their own ship, another naval vessel, or rely on air force or missile defense systems. 'In one operation, we were launching strikes on a key Hezbollah asset when a hostile drone suddenly appeared,' a crew member recalled. 'One section of the combat center focused on intercepting the drone, while another continued the attack—both simultaneously, without pausing.' The Battle at Sea During the war, Israeli naval forces even intercepted drones launched from Yemen under surreal circumstances. 'We were in the Red Sea, hearing party music from hotels in Eilat, watching fireworks and celebrations in the distance—while at the same time, we knew a drone was en route. But we intercepted it far from Israeli shores, ensuring safety without disruption,' a sailor recounted. Despite the relative calm following the ceasefire, vigilance remains high. For Col. A. and his subordinates, a Hezbollah coastal missile launch is a constant threat. The commander recalled a mission two months ago when his unit obliterated the Syrian navy. 'We reached just a few kilometers from the Syrian coast and watched their ships sink as their ports burned. When we returned to Haifa, Navy Chief Vice Adm. David Saar Salama was waiting on the dock. He congratulated us and immediately ordered us back out to protect the gas rigs.' INS Nitzachon is also led by Deputy Commander Maj. A., and soon, the Israeli Navy is set to appoint its first-ever female missile boat commander. The navy is preparing to integrate more female combatants, not only in officer roles but also on the upcoming Reshef-class ships. 'They’re the backbone of the ship—brilliant and exceptional,' said Col. A. 'At the height of the war, we had an entire armada at sea, with over 1,000 navy personnel operating simultaneously, from Syria to the Red Sea.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/h1gn7g7qke	2025-02-19T00:46:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/yk14265816/yk14265816_0_75_912_514_0_small.jpg

Four were arrested after throwing stones at Israeli soldiers who arrived to disperse them. Two IDF soldiers were lightly injured during the clashes. The soldiers received medical treatment and were evacuated to a hospital. Members of the Hassidic Breslov sect succeeded to cross into Lebanon last week near the tomb complex and were later returned to Israel. Some were detained for questioning. 'Upon the arrival of IDF troops at the site, several individuals in the group began disturbing the peace and even threw stones at the soldiers,' the police said in statement. 'Northern District officers arrived at the scene, and after coordinating with the military, arrested four suspects on suspicion of crossing the border and disturbing the peace. The rest of the group was returned to Israeli territory by the IDF and removed from the area.' The police said that they would consider requesting an extension of the detainees’ remand at the Kiryat Shmona Magistrates' Court. They also emphasized that crossing into Lebanon was illegal and carries a prison sentence of up to four years. The tomb of Rabbi Ashi, a key figure in the compiling the Babylonian Talmud and considred one of the greatest sages of the Talmudic era, has become a major destination for members of the Breslov sect, which seeks out and visits the graves of revered rabbis in Israel and abroad. These visits have occasionally led to security incidents.

Until Israel’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000, the entire complex was within Israeli territory. However, as this location was a point of dispute between the two countries, the border was redrawn through the site following a recommendation by UN envoy Terje Rød-Larsen. Due to its proximity to the border, even the Israeli section of the site is now designated as a closed military zone. According to Hasidic tradition, praying at the grave of a revered rabbi is believed to bring spiritual merit. Rabbi Natan, the foremost disciple of Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, wrote in Likutey Halakhot: 'The righteous are greater in death than in life. In death, they rectify the souls of Israel even more than in life. They subdue the forces of impurity that cling to fallen souls due to their sins, for the righteous overpower and nullify these forces more in death than in life.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj3vj11xqkg	2025-02-19T00:01:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/16/r1W2srmkcJg/r1W2srmkcJg_55_0_901_507_0_small.jpg

Rehabilitation still an everyday reality for the wounded of Octob...	Survivors battling physical and emotional wounds; stories of perseverance highlight the long road of rehabilitation, marked by pain, resilience, some even find love 'As soon as I can kneel, I’ll propose' At first glance, he may seem out of place—a large man in his late 40s standing among a group of young people, the age of his soldier daughter. But then you notice the portable vacuum pump connected to him by a tube, and it makes sense. Later, during the photo shoot for this article, Superintendent Mati Tsarfati lifts his shirt to reveal a long scar running down his back, marking where the AK-47 bullet pierced him. Tsarfati, who was the operations officer of the Sderot police station, is one of the few injured from October 7 who is still in rehabilitation. Eight of his subordinates fell that morning. His story, and the stories of others—like Ron, who was injured in Gaza on December 8, 2023, and has been in recovery for over a year and two months, and Eran, who completed his rehabilitation after being injured in Khan Younis and transitioned to outpatient treatment—highlight the continuing struggles of those injured in battle. Their war persists, fought through countless challenges, not all of which end in victory. Superintendent Tsarfati was wounded by sniper fire after neutralizing several terrorists. He vividly recalls the circumstances of his injury. 'I arrived at the station, and just as I was pulling into the parking lot, a Nukhba terrorist appeared in front of me and fired five bullets, hitting my car.' Tsarfati recounts the battle in great detail, but he emphasizes the bravery of the officers who fell, some of whom fought right by his side. 'After the first encounter, where we neutralized two terrorists, I met with the district commander at the time, Deputy Commissioner Amir Cohen. Together, we charged toward the station and eliminated five more terrorists. Then I saw that one of the terrorists we had hit was still alive and trying to lift his weapon toward the district commander, so I shot him in the head. At that moment, another terrorist shot me—one bullet hit my chest, and another hit my leg. The community security officer, Ronen Gabai, along with a National Counter-Terrorism Unit officer, dragged me behind a shelter.' He lay there for three hours, bleeding but fully conscious. 'I called my wife on video, told her I was injured, that I love her and the kids, and that I would do everything to stay alive.' He kept his promise. Superintendent Tsarfati was evacuated to Barzilai Medical Center, where the medical team fought to save his life. 'When I woke up, they tried to shield me from the magnitude of the loss. But for me, the loss was overwhelming. These were my subordinates, and losing them hit me hard.' When his condition stabilized, Tsarfati was transferred to Soroka Medical Center in Be’er Sheva. 'I underwent a very complex surgery led by Dr. Shlomo Yaron Yishai, Professor Yael Refaeli, and Dr. Assaf Aker. They stitched up my lung, replaced six ribs with titanium ones, and also replaced my shoulder blade. From there, I was transferred to rehabilitation at Soroka under the supervision of Dr. Yuli Trager.' The first chapter of his rehabilitation ended on January 1, 2024. 'I was discharged from Soroka, transitioned to outpatient rehab, and simultaneously, Commander Yogev Attias, head of the Sa’ar Division (Public Order, Defense, and Sovereignty), appointed me as the operations officer.' In April of that year, Tsarfati began his new role. In August, he went on a Mediterranean cruise with his family. During the trip, he experienced unbearable pain in his wounded leg. 'When we returned to Israel, they opened up my pelvis to take a piece of bone to place in my leg. As a result, I developed a severe pelvic infection and had to undergo 23 surgeries. I’ve been here at Soroka for four months now, attached to a VAC device that drains the wound, so I can’t leave the hospital.' Tsarfati is both physically and mentally strong. In the past, he completed two full marathons. 'I know I won’t be running marathons again, but as soon as they remove the tube, I’ll get back to training.' Love formed amid rehabilitation Rehabilitation is often misunderstood as a steady path of improvement, but the reality is far from that. 'Rehabilitation is one step back, two steps forward,' says Ron Sapir, 22, from Moshav Zitan, a commander in the 603rd Engineering Battalion of the IDF. Sapir was injured by an explosive device on December 14, 2023, in southern Gaza. The incident claimed the life of Sergeant Oz Shmuel Ardi, who was sitting beside him in the Namer APC. 'I looked at my leg and realized it was barely attached, just a small piece of quadriceps muscle. My bone flew off in the explosion.' Ron was classified as critically injured. He spent a month at Soroka, where doctors saved his leg from amputation. 'When I woke up five days later, I saw my mom beside me. I asked her, ‘Do I still have my leg?’ She said, ‘Yes.’ Then I fell asleep again.' He was later transferred to the 'Back to Life' rehabilitation wing at Sheba Medical Center. 'Rehabilitation lifts you up when you’re surrounded by other injured soldiers, but when they start getting discharged and you’re left behind, it’s hard. You’re happy for them, but at the same time, you think, ‘What about me?’ It burns you up. Triple amputees who arrived after me were discharged before me. I also struggled with infections and was on antibiotics for nearly a year. I held on thanks to my family, especially my twin sister Shai, who was with me throughout rehab, and my girlfriend Maya. She’s the best thing that came out of this experience.' Ron met Maya Dimri, a law student his age, during rehab. 'I had a crush on her back in high school,' Ron admits. 'Back then, I wasn’t so interested,' Maya laughs, recounting how they reconnected. 'My mom came to Sheba to visit injured soldiers and bring gifts. She happened to pass by Ron’s room. He recognized her and shouted, ‘Maya’s mom! Maya’s mom!’ Suddenly, I get a picture of Ron from my mom.' Ron: 'I thought to myself, ‘What do I have to lose?’ I messaged her and asked her to visit me.' The rest is history. They’ve been a couple for six months now. 'But because of everything we’ve been through together, it feels like ten years.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ron: 'We’re looking for an apartment. Mention in the article—three rooms with an elevator or on the ground floor, close to Sheba.' So when’s the wedding? 'As soon as I can kneel, I’ll propose.' Eran, a 22-year-old reservist in the Yahalom Engineering Unit, is also undergoing rehabilitation at Soroka. While attached to the 13th Battalion of the Golani Brigade, he was wounded during a maneuver on the second night of Hanukkah. 'We were clearing a building in northern Gaza, preparing it for use, when I got hit in the leg by a bullet.' Eran’s injury, while seemingly minor, turned severe. He ended up at Soroka with a shattered bone, a torn artery, and recurring infections. 'I’ve had 12 surgeries so far. They took bone from my pelvis to replace the missing bone, muscle from one area, an artery from another, and skin from somewhere else,' he says, pointing to the scars on both legs. 'Two months ago, they did another bone graft, this time from my thigh. You see the light, and then you go back.' In October, Eran began studying civil engineering at Ben-Gurion University, near the hospital. Beyond pursuing a profession, the studies are part of his rehabilitation. 'I wake up at seven in the morning, do an hour of physiotherapy, and start classes at nine. Until last week, I was getting around campus on a mobility scooter; now, I use crutches. Studying distracts me from constantly dwelling on the negative.' Before enlisting, Eran was a professional athlete in tumbling (acrobatic gymnastics practiced on mats). He placed second in Israel and represented the country at the world championship in Russia. He shows a video of himself doing nine consecutive flips in the air. 'I’ll get back to it, even if not at the same level,' he promises. Watching him fight to reclaim his life, it’s hard not to doubt his determination. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bywg6hf91x	2025-02-18T23:49:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/BygLMGBe9Jx/BygLMGBe9Jx_0_46_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Can the IDF and UNIFIL prevent a future Hezbollah attack on Israe...	While daily life in northern Israel has improved—with no sirens, no shelter runs, and schools operating as usual—concerns linger As tensions persist along Israel’s northern border, residents of the region remain cautiously optimistic about the withdrawal from Lebanon, according to Avraham Levine, the ALMA Research Center media manager. While daily life has improved—with no sirens, no shelter runs, and schools operating as usual—concerns linger. 'Are we counting on these other forces and agreements, or do we still have to rely on the IDF? I think the answer is obvious,' Levine said. Despite renewed efforts to deploy the Lebanese Armed Forces and UNIFIL in southern Lebanon, experts remain skeptical about their ability to curb Hezbollah’s influence. Levine noted that similar measures taken after the 2006 war largely failed, and recent reports of attacks on UNIFIL forces further highlight the fragile situation. Meanwhile, the U.S. has ramped up pressure, with reports that U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing for Hezbollah’s full demilitarization. To mitigate immediate threats, the IDF is holding key strategic outposts along the border, securing high vantage points that allow surveillance and deterrence against potential Hezbollah attacks. 'If the IDF is there, Hezbollah is not there,' Levine emphasized, pointing to the critical role of these positions in preventing incursions similar to the October 7 attack. While these measures offer short-term security, the long-term stability of northern Israel remains uncertain, he said.

Hamas says open to new Gaza leadership, but refuses to disarm or ...	Terror group's spokesperson says that the issue of governance in the enclave will be discussed in the second phase of negotiations, set to begin in the coming days Hamas said that it does not see a necessity to govern the Gaza Strip in the future, but the group made it clear that withdrawing from Gaza or disarming was not an option. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told the Al Arabiya network late on Tuesday that the issue of governance in Gaza will be discussed in the second phase of negotiations, which are set to begin in the coming days. 'Any future arrangement will be reached through national (Palestinian) consensus,' Qassem added. 'There is no need for Hamas to be in Gaza's government in the future. We have made concessions regarding the future of governance, but we have every right to remain part of the political landscape,' Qassem said. In practice, it appears that Hamas is attempting to replicate Hezbollah’s model in Lebanon: the group would not assume civil control over the Strip or be responsible for the welfare and needs of its residents. Instead, it could focus its resources entirely on 'resistance'—meaning preparations for war with Israel. Since Hamas remains the dominant military force in Gaza, it would dictate the reality on the ground, while civilian officials could effectively act as its proxies. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Meanwhile, the Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar cited Egyptian sources claiming that 'Israel has no desire to accelerate the pace of negotiations in the coming days.' According to the report, Cairo perceives this as an attempt to maintain the current situation, in which aid shipments to Gaza remain restricted, slowing efforts to rebuild. There were also concerns in Egypt that Israel may renege on an agreement to allow caravans into Gaza on Thursday. According to the sources cited in Al-Akhbar, Israel's measures stem from a 'desire to open the door for voluntary migration from Gaza and render the Strip uninhabitable.' Another report, in the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, quoted different Egyptian sources who said that Cairo has been consulting with European Union representatives to establish a joint oversight mechanism for a temporary committee composed of independent Palestinian figures unaffiliated with Hamas, Fatah, or the Palestinian Authority. According to the report, this committee would manage Gaza under direct Egyptian supervision with European monitoring. The sources told the newspaper that The Egyptian government had reached understandings with Hamas regarding its removal from all aspects of civilian and security governance in Gaza, and noted that Hamas had shown flexibility and cooperation. Such a committee could theoretically align with Israel’s demands, as outlined on Monday by Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar. The negotiations on the second phase of the agreement are expected to begin this week, led by Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, who will engage in talks with U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff. On Monday, Israeli officials emphasized that the requirements for the next phase include the demilitarization of Gaza. Additionally, Israel made clear that any form of Hamas, Fatah, or Palestinian Authority rule over the Strip would be unacceptable. 'We will not agree to the continued presence of Hamas or any other terrorist organization in Gaza,' Sa’ar said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjrynwxqjg	2025-02-18T22:50:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/15/rylgkGJ0Kyg/rylgkGJ0Kyg_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Israel, India accelerate free trade talks	The latest push comes as Israel sent its largest-ever business delegation to India, marking a major step in strengthening economic ties Israel and India are moving toward a historic free trade agreement, with negotiations expected to conclude by the end of the year. The latest push comes as Israel sent its largest-ever business delegation to India, marking a major step in strengthening economic ties. Over 100 Israeli companies—spanning cybersecurity, smart agriculture, renewable energy, and AI—participated in more than 600 business meetings with Indian counterparts. The goal? Expanding Israeli exports, securing investments, and fostering bilateral trade. India’s commerce and industry minister highlighted the vast opportunities for collaboration and announced plans to lead a delegation of Indian executives to Israel next year to advance partnerships in key sectors. With bilateral trade already reaching $5 billion in 2024, both nations see immense potential for growth. Israel is India’s fourth-largest supplier of military hardware, and cooperation is expanding in water systems, healthcare, and solar energy. The momentum also aligns with U.S. efforts to establish a new trade corridor linking India, Israel, and Europe. Officials say the free trade agreement will serve as a key pillar in this ambitious economic initiative. As both nations prepare for next year’s business delegation to Israel, expectations are high that this partnership will shape the future of trade and innovation in the region.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyysbwq5jg	2025-02-18T22:22:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/19/SyGtU11m5yx/SyGtU11m5yx_78_0_947_533_0_small.jpg
Scramble to avoid crisis after Israeli envoy accuses Egypt of pea...	WJC president Ron Lauder rushes to meet President el-Sisi to ease tensions and reaffirm diplomatic ties after Israeli US Ambassador Yehiel Leiter accused Egypt of undermining peace agreements with Israel, bolstering military presence in Sinai World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder arrived in Cairo on Tuesday for a swiftly arranged meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and the country’s intelligence chief, General Hassan Rashad after Israeli Ambassador to Washington Yehiel Leiter accused Egypt of 'deliberately undermining its peace agreements with Israel.' Leiter claimed that Cairo was 'building up an enhanced Egyptian force in Sinai.' According to statements from the Egyptian presidency, the discussion focused on Egypt’s efforts to achieve regional peace and establish a Palestinian state. El-Sissi emphasized his desire for 'all involved parties,' including Israel, to 'act with full responsibility' to ensure that the ceasefire remains in place. Lauder, in turn, praised el-Sissi for his 'proper leadership.' However, two senior Egyptian officials revealed that Lauder had rushed to Cairo in an effort to ease tensions following Ambassador Leiter’s blunt statements. In a broadcasted conversation with Jewish leaders in the United States, Leiter had claimed that 'the Egyptian bases established in Sinai are primarily for offensive weapons, which constitutes a blatant violation of the peace agreements'—and questioned: 'Who is the Egyptian army preparing to attack?' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Although Leiter’s remarks were quickly deleted from online platforms, they had already been reported by American and Israeli media, which noted that this was the first time a senior Israeli official had accused Egypt of such a significant violation of the peace accords. In response, ten of Egypt’s most prominent television hosts took to the airwaves to 'defend the nation’s honor,' ridiculing the ambassador’s statements. One after another, they declared, 'No one wants to go to war—but if we must, we are ready and prepared.' Lauder sought to reassure his Egyptian counterparts, emphasizing his commitment to the president’s position, highlighting the strong relationship between Egypt’s presidential palace and American Jewry, and praising Egypt’s efforts—under el-Sissi’s leadership—to achieve peace in the Middle East. He also expressed anticipation for Egypt’s forthcoming proposal at the Arab summit regarding Gaza’s future and reconstruction plans. El-Sissi confirmed that he would participate in the upcoming mini-Arab summit in Riyadh over the weekend and would expand on these issues at the full Arab League summit in Cairo, where 22 Arab leaders are expected to attend. He stressed that 'reconstruction plans will proceed without displacing Gaza’s residents.' Lauder, in turn, congratulated the Egyptian president on his 'wise counsel.' A senior Egyptian official told Ynet and its sister publication Yedioth Ahronoth that Lauder appeared embarrassed when presented with a transcript of Ambassador Leiter’s remarks. The transcript included el-Sissi’s statements asserting that Egypt 'is committed to establishing a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders, with its capital declared in East Jerusalem.' Lauder did not respond. 'It was clear to us,' the Egyptian official said, 'that Lauder understands Egypt’s role as a mediator between Israel and Hamas, and he repeatedly emphasized Israel’s appreciation for the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. There is no doubt that Lauder came to defuse the tensions sparked by the ambassador’s comments. It was important for him to reaffirm the respect the U.S. holds for the peace agreements.' This is not the first time Israel has accused Egypt of violating the peace accords, but tensions have escalated due to President Donald Trump’s request that el-Sissi absorb a significant portion of Gaza’s population into Egyptian territory. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'gave the impression' that he was open to the American plan. Meanwhile, a mini-Arab summit is set to take place this week in Riyadh, attended by leaders from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and the Gulf states, with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas also expected to participate. The meeting is intended to prepare for the full Arab League summit in Cairo, originally scheduled for February 27. On Monday, the event was postponed to March 4. Arab League Deputy Secretary-General Hossam Zaki attributed the delay to 'logistical issues.' Behind the scenes, however, it was made clear that the U.S. administration had expressed strong dissatisfaction with the summit’s agenda, prompting the postponement to allow for a more moderated final statement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjmifl75yl	2025-02-18T22:12:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/BJGNpZ11cyg/BJGNpZ11cyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

The pope has pneumonia in both lungs but remains in good spirits,...	Holy See says 88-year-old pontiff's respiratory infection also involves asthmatic bronchitis, which requires the use of cortisone antibiotic treatment, adding that his condition continues to be 'complex' ROME (AP) — Pope Francis has developed pneumonia in both lungs, the Vatican said Tuesday, after new tests showed a further complication in the condition of the 88-year-old pontiff that raised concerns about his ability to fight off the infection. The Vatican said Francis’ respiratory infection also involves asthmatic bronchitis, which requires the use of cortisone antibiotic treatment. 'Laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and the Holy Father’s clinical condition continue to present a complex picture,' the Vatican said. Nevertheless the pope, who had the upper lobe of his right lung removed as a young man, is in good spirits and is grateful for the prayers for his recovery, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a late update. Francis was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital in a 'fair' condition on Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. On Monday, medical personnel determined that he was suffering from a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, meaning a mix of viruses, bacteria and possibly other organisms had colonized in his respiratory tract. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The follow-up chest CT scan which the Holy Father underwent this afternoon ... demonstrated the onset of bilateral pneumonia, which required additional drug therapy,' Bruni said. Bronchitis can lead to pneumonia, which is a deeper and far more serious infection of the lungs’ air sacs. Pneumonia can develop in part of one lung or an entire lung or both lungs. It tends to be more serious when both lungs are affected because there isn’t healthy lung tissue to compensate. Treatment varies by severity but can include providing oxygen through a nasal tube or mask, intravenous fluids – and treatment of the underlying cause of the infection. To date Francis is not known to be using supplemental oxygen, and he has eaten breakfast every day, read the newspapers and done some work from his hospital room. The Vatican hasn’t provided any information about how Francis is responding to any of the drugs he has been given other than to say he isn’t running a fever. Dr. Carmelo D’Asero, an infectious disease and geriatric disease expert in Rome, said Francis’ lack of a fever was not necessarily a positive thing, given the seriousness of his infection. 'A high fever is a sign of an immune response to a pathogen,' he said. 'Having a low fever and having a serious bronchial infection ... is a sign of a decreased immune response and that makes us worry a little bit more, let’s say. Maybe if he had a fever, it would have been better.' The Vatican has given no indication of how long the pope might remain hospitalized, only saying that the treatment of such a 'complex clinical picture,' which has already required several changes in his drug regimen, would require an 'adequate' stay. Despite the less than positive news about Francis’ condition, a rainbow appeared over the Gemelli hospital on Tuesday afternoon and Francis received get-well drawings and cards from children being treated in the hospital’s oncology ward. In a sign that other Vatican business was proceeding as usual Tuesday, the Vatican No. 2, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, continued his delicate visit to Burkina Faso and another top Vatican cardinal, Cardinal Michael Czerny, prepared to leave Wednesday for a five-day visit to Lebanon. But other business had to be canceled. There will be no weekly general audience Wednesday, and it’s not clear if Francis will miss his Sunday noon blessing for a second week in a row. His hospitalization has also forced the cancellation of some events surrounding the Vatican Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century ceremony in which millions of pilgrims flock to Rome. This Holy Year weekend was dedicated to deacons, the ministry that is a necessary step for men who are preparing to become priests. Francis had an unrelated audience Saturday and was supposed to have ordained the deacons during a Mass on Sunday. The Vatican on Tuesday announced his audience was canceled and that the archbishop who is organizing the Jubilee would celebrate the Mass in the pope’s place. It’s a similar arrangement that the Vatican announced last weekend when artists in town had to settle for a scrapped papal audience and a cardinal presiding over their special Mass. The next Jubilee events on the calendar that would typically involve the pope are the March 8-9 weekend dedicated to volunteers. Francis had part of one lung removed after a pulmonary infection as a young man and is prone to bouts of bronchitis in winter. He has admitted in the past that he is a non-compliant patient, and even his close Vatican aides have said he pushed himself too far even once his bronchitis was diagnosed. He refused to let up on his busy schedule and ignored medical advice to stay indoors during Rome’s chilly winter, insisting on sitting through an outdoor Jubilee Mass for the armed forces on Feb. 9 even though he was having trouble breathing. Francis’ hospital admission this year has already sidelined him for longer than a 2023 hospitalization for pneumonia. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyggulq5yx	2025-02-18T21:25:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/rJUUs2g5Jl/rJUUs2g5Jl_0_195_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Florida hate crimes unit probes shooting of Israelis thought to b...	After Mordechai Brafman is charged earlier with two counts of attempted murder Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava thanks prosecutors on X for 'pursuing hate crimes charges' Local prosecutors in Florida said on Tuesday their hate crimes unit was probing a shooting by a male suspect who, according to police, fired on two men he thought were Palestinians but turned out to be Israeli visitors. The Miami-Dade state attorney's office said its hate crimes unit 'reviews every criminal offense that has the potential of being motivated by hate.' Rights advocates note a rise in anti-Muslim, anti-Palestinian and antisemitic hate since the start of U.S. ally Israel's war in Gaza following an October 7, 2023, Hamas massacre. The website of Miami-Dade County Corrections says the suspect, 27-year-old Mordechai Brafman, was charged earlier with two counts of attempted murder and booked on Sunday for the shooting on Saturday. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava thanked prosecutors on X for 'pursuing hate crimes charges.' According to investigators, Brafman overtook the victims' car in Miami Beach, made a U-turn, exited his vehicle and fired 17 shots at them. Local authorities said there was no prior confrontation between Brafman and the victims, who did not know each other. Brafman, when interviewed by police, said that while he was driving his truck in Miami Beach, he saw two people he thought were Palestinians. He said that he then stopped, shot at and killed them, according to police. However, the victims survived. One was shot in the shoulder and the other had a wounded forearm. They turned out to be Israelis and not Palestinians, police said. Dustin Tischler, a lawyer for Brafman, told the Washington Post they were 'fully cooperating with law enforcement' and 'acknowledge the seriousness of the allegations.' He added Brafman had been 'experiencing a severe mental health crisis which caused him to be in fear for his life.'

Incidents raising alarm over antisemitism include threats of violence against Jews at Cornell University that led to a conviction and sentencing, an unsuccessful plot to attack a New York Jewish center and physical assaults against a Jewish man in Michigan, a rabbi in Maryland and two Jewish students in Chicago. Also in Florida, a local chapter of one of North America's largest fraternities, Pi Gamma Delta, at the University of Central Floriday (UCF) came under investigation into alleged 'antisemitic hazing rituals.' According to reports filed with police, one such ritual involved a student being bound and blindfolded while being forced to hold a swastika for hours. The incident has drawn strong condemnation from university officials and Jewish organizations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1gwxfg5je	2025-02-18T20:04:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/rywmrwxcJe/rywmrwxcJe_1_0_975_548_0_small.jpg

President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he will not let billionaire Elon Musk take part in any space-related government decisions, when the president was asked about Musk's potential conflicts of interest amid his drive to cut government spending. 'So anything to do with possibly even space, we won't let Elon partake in that,' Trump told reporters. The White House has previously said Musk would excuse himself from any conflicts of interest between his various business interests and efforts to cut costs for the federal government via his Department of Government Efficiency. The White House said on Monday that Musk's role in the Trump administration was as a White House employee and senior adviser to the president, and that he was not an employee of DOGE. The White House also said Musk had no decision-making authority.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syfjoqmq1g	2025-02-18T14:46:01-08:00

Marian Turski, Holocaust survivor and 'guardian of memory' who wa...	He survived two Nazi death marches, and was a co-founder of the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews and an advocate of Polish-Jewish understanding; Marian Turski, a Holocaust survivor who became a journalist and historian in postwar Poland and co-founded Warsaw’s landmark Jewish history museum, died on Tuesday. He was 98. The POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews announced his death, describing him as a person of exceptional moral and intellectual qualities who always stood on the side 'of minorities, the excluded, the wronged.' 'An authority of global importance, an advocate of Polish-Jewish understanding, a publicist, a historian. A Polish Jew. A person without whom our museum would not exist,' the museum director, Zygmunt Stępiński, wrote in a statement. Turski survived the Lodz ghetto, where he and his family were forced to live, two death marches and imprisonment at the Nazi German concentration camps Buchenwald and Auschwitz-Birkenau, which was in German-occupied Poland. In all, he lost 39 relatives in the Holocaust. Unlike many Jewish survivors who left postwar Poland, Turski chose to remain. He was on the political left his entire life, and was a member of the communist party. While on a scholarship to the United States in 1956, he marched from Selma to Montgomery with Martin Luther King Jr. in support of civil rights for Black Americans. Turski was among a dwindling number of Holocaust survivors and spoke during observances last month marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. Turski called on people to not remain indifferent when minorities are discriminated against, when history is distorted and when 'any authority violates the existing social contract' It was a stark warning about the dangers of indifference at the 75th anniversary that brought him international attention and raised his moral profile among his supporters. Turski said at the time that the Holocaust did not 'fall from the sky' all at once but took hold step by step as society’s acceptance of small acts of discrimination eventually led to ghettos and extermination camps. With world leaders in the audience, Turski called on people to not remain indifferent when minorities are discriminated against, when history is distorted and when 'any authority violates the existing social contract.' Many in Poland interpreted his words as a critique of the right-wing government in power at the time. Some who felt targeted criticized him for using the Auschwitz anniversary to comment on the political situation, or suggested that Turski lacked the moral authority for such a warning because of his past support for communism. Citing the words of another survivor, Roman Kent, Turski described what should be the Eleventh Commandment of the Bible: 'Though shalt not be indifferent. 'Because if you are indifferent, before you know it, another Auschwitz will come out of the blue for you or your descendants,' he warned. Poland’s chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, said members of the Jewish community would miss him greatly. 'Marian was our teacher, he was our moral voice and mentor. He was steeped in Jewish wisdom and used it to guide us on how to face today’s problems. We are so blessed that we had Marian with us for so many years,' Schudrich said. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Tuesday after Turski’s death that those words had become 'a motto for us,' adding on X: 'The 11th Commandment for these difficult times.' Poland’s conservative President Andrzej Duda also paid tribute to Turski, saying: 'He consistently spoke about the need to cultivate sensitivity to evil. May his memory be honored!' Turski was born on June 26, 1926, as Mosze Turbowicz and spent his childhood and teenage years in Lodz, where he attended a Hebrew language school. In 1944, his parents and brother were deported to the German Nazi camp Auschwitz, and he arrived there two weeks later in one of the last transports. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: His father and brother died in the gas chambers, while his mother was sent to work at the Bergen Belsen camp in northern Germany, and Turski was dispatched to work on roads in the Auschwitz-Birkenau area before being sent on two death marches. He was liberated at Terezin, close to death from exhaustion and typhus. In September 1945, he returned to Poland, a committed communist who rejected an offer to go to the West and wanted to help build a socialist Poland. When a communist official recommended that he change his name to adopt one that didn’t sound Jewish, he complied, a biography published by the POLIN museum said. He used his last time on the stage at last month’s Auschwitz anniversary observance to warn of the dangers of hatred and to recall that the number of those murdered was always far greater than the smaller group of survivors. 'We have always been a tiny minority,' Turski said. 'And now only a handful remain.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyfticfcke	2025-02-18T14:38:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/ByQEm7SOyx/ByQEm7SOyx_0_41_941_529_0_small.jpg
After a decade in Hamas captivity, hostages Avera Mengistu, Hisha...	After over 3,500 days in captivity the two Israeli civilians are set to be released as part of the hostage deal; Their long-awaited return brings relief to their families, who have spent years fighting for their release while grappling with uncertainty over their fate Two Israelis who have been held captive in Gaza for nearly a decade are set to return home as part of the latest hostage deal — Avera Mengistu, who will be released after 3,821 days in captivity, and Hisham al-Sayed, who has been held for 3,595 days. For Mengistu’s family, the news brings an end to more than 10 years of uncertainty. 'We are overwhelmed with emotions,' said Gil Elias, 48, a relative who has led efforts to bring Mengistu home. He said that Mengistu’s mother, Agarnesh, received the long-awaited phone call confirming his release. 'His parents, siblings, and the entire family will be there to welcome him. These are joyous and surprising news that we have been waiting for over a decade,' Elias told Ynet. 'I believe he’s okay. If he has survived all these years, he must have found a way to endure,' Elias added. 'Maybe when someone is taken out of their comfort zone, they discover strengths they never knew they had. We don’t know for sure — but we will soon. We just want him back.' Years of waiting and uncertainty Mengistu, a man with mental health issues, crossed into Gaza on Sept. 7, 2014. His family has fought for years to prove he did not enter of his own free will. 'At first, people didn’t understand what we were saying. They told us, ‘It’s your problem, he went on his own,’' Elias recalled last month, when reports surfaced that Mengistu had been included in the first phase of the hostage deal. 'It was hard to explain the situation and the military failure that allowed it to happen.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In the family’s living room in Ashkelon, a photo of Mengistu from a Hamas-released video sits at the center of the room. 'As time went by, many assumed he was no longer alive, but I always believed he was,' Elias said. Last May, the family received another confirmation that Mengistu was still alive. 'We know his mental and physical health are in terrible condition, but we don’t know exactly what state he will be in when he returns,' Elias said at the time. Hisham al-Sayed’s family: ‘A decade of waiting’ Al-Sayed, a Bedouin resident of southern Israel, was born on Feb. 15, 1988. Just three days ago, he marked his 37th birthday in captivity — his ninth in Gaza since he crossed the border on April 21, 2015. 'Hisham will be home after 3,595 days — almost a decade of waiting,' his family said in a statement. 'But the news of his release will not feel complete until every hostage returns. This deal must not stop. No one should endure a decade in captivity.' The last proof of life his family received was in 2022 when Hamas released a video showing him in Gaza, connected to an oxygen mask. 'Seeing that footage didn’t give us hope — it just told us he was still alive,' his father said. Since the October 7 Hamas terror attack, al-Sayed’s father has found himself supporting families who are now experiencing the same pain he has lived with for nearly a decade. 'We met Ethiopian families, families of soldiers — it didn’t feel like there were any differences between us,' he said. 'After October 7, the number of hostages was overwhelming. It took me two weeks just to process what had happened. We try to support as many families as we can, regardless of politics. This is about bringing people home.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkcw00yzc1g	2025-02-18T14:21:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/01/18/r1G4HISsi/r1G4HISsi_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
As Lebanese celebrate return to border villages, Hezbollah terror...	Residents celebrated Israel's withdrawal from border villages, but returning locals were shocked by the destruction: 'No houses, no plants, nothing'; In Kila, where '90% of buildings were destroyed', two Hezbollah operatives reportedly emerged from the rubble after contact with them was cut off 3 months ago; Supporters of the terror group claimed the IDF lied: 'South Lebanon hasn't been cleared of terrorists' Israel has almost completely withdrawn from southern Lebanon, with the Lebanese condemning the continued 'occupation' in five strategic points along the border. At the same time, they are celebrating the return to their villages in the south, but are still reeling from the immense destruction left behind. 'What I’m seeing is unbelievable. I’m in shock,' said Khoddo Suleiman, a construction worker who returned Tuesday to the village of Kila. Pointing to his destroyed home on a hill, he added, 'There’s no house, no vegetation, nothing. I feel a mix of joy and sadness.' Suleiman had fled Kila about six months ago due to the intensification of battles at that time. The IDF on Tuesday completed its withdrawal from the last of the villages near the border that it still controlled, in accordance with the cease-fire agreement with Hezbollah that came into effect in late November. The withdrawal was originally scheduled for two weeks ago, but the deadline was extended in coordination with the U.S. after Israel called for increased Lebanese military activity in the area south of the Litani River, where Hezbollah was prohibited from operating. Despite the withdrawal, Israel maintains a presence at five strategic points along the border in the hills, where military outposts were established to ensure better protection for northern Israeli communities. In Lebanon, there have been calls for a complete withdrawal, with criticism of Israel’s continued 'occupation,' but there is also hope that the cease-fire will hold. Hezbollah has not issued any significant threats, though tensions remain. The IDF has already withdrawn from numerous villages where it had been engaged in operations to dismantle Hezbollah’s vast terror infrastructure. The result was widespread destruction in these areas, and in recent weeks, clashes have occurred between Lebanese residents trying to return to these areas and Lebanese forces. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On Tuesday morning, the Lebanese military announced that following the completion of the Israeli withdrawal, its forces had been deployed in 11 additional southern Lebanese villages: Al-Abbasiya, Al-Majidiya, Kila, Al-Adisa, Markaba, Houla, Miss Al-Jabal, Blida, Muhaybib, Maroun al-Ras, and parts of Yaroun. Israeli drones hovered overhead as destruction remained on the ground. 'We’ll rebuild from scratch,' said 36-year-old mechanic Atif Arabi, who returned to Kila with hopes of discovering whether his home had survived the fighting. He added, 'I’m very happy to return to finally find out if my house is destroyed. If it is, I will rebuild it.' Hussein Fares, another resident who fled in October 2023, said he had waited a year and a half for this moment. 'I counted the seconds until today,' he said, though he acknowledged the rebuilding process would be long and complex. The mayor of Kila, Hassan Sheit, told The Associated Press that the devastation in the village is enormous, with 90% of homes destroyed and the remainder damaged. 'There is no house or structure standing,' he said. He noted that reconstruction would have to start 'from zero.' Photos from Kila show the widespread destruction, but reports also emerged Tueday of a surprising discovery in the village: Two young men were found alive under the rubble. Their families had lost contact with them three months ago, and they were presumed dead. They were rushed to the hospital. Although not explicitly stated in the reports, the two men are believed to be Hezbollah terrorists, and one was filmed being welcomed home with Hezbollah flags in Kila. Ali Murtada, a well-known reporter for the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen network, posted a video on X, referring to the two men as 'fighters' of Hezbollah. 'Hello, my enemies. I hope you have a very bad day,' he said in English, addressing Israelis. This appears to be part of psychological warfare aimed at deterring residents from returning to villages in northern Israel. Murtada claimed that the discovery of the two men proves that the IDF and the Israeli government 'are lying' to the public. 'After bombing Kila for a year with more than 2,000 airstrikes, after fighting inside Kila and occupying it for two months, after staying there and bombing houses and all infrastructure, and searching under every stone to find or kill Hezbollah fighters, now, after your withdrawal, two Hezbollah fighters were found alive in Kila,' Murtada said. 'Your army needs an eye exam. It lies to you, saying all of southern Lebanon is now clear of Hezbollah fighters. But when they were in Kila, two Hezbollah fighters were there, and you didn’t know.' The credibility of these claims is unclear, but the fear remains that Hezbollah could operate in the shadows to rebuild its capabilities, taking advantage of the reconstruction efforts in the destroyed villages. Israel has promised to act decisively against any violation of the ceasefire, and throughout the truce, IDF strikes in deep southern Lebanon have continued, although far less frequently than before and without significant Hezbollah retaliation. Hezbollah has refrained from issuing any real threats as part of its demand for Israel to withdraw completely from the five strategic points along the border. A prominent Hezbollah member of parliament, Hassan Fadlallah, who returned Tuesday to the village of Yaroun, told Reuters that 'the main responsibility' for the 'liberation' of these hills rests with the Lebanese government. The Lebanese government has indicated that only Lebanon should make decisions regarding 'war or peace,' a likely signal that Hezbollah, whose internal strength has diminished due to the war and the decimation of its leadership, does not want to drag Lebanon into another destructive conflict as it did on October 8, 2023, when it launched a 'support front' for Hamas, just a day after the massacre. Fadlallah also spoke to Hezbollah’s Al-Manar channel, saying, 'Every day of liberation is a day of pride, honor and humanity. The government has a great national responsibility, beyond expelling the enemy from the land it occupies. From these borders, we salute our supreme leader (Nasrallah) and tell him that even if his body is absent, his spirit is present.' The Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper Al-Akhbar also published a defiant cartoon Tuesday morning, depicting a blood-stained hand emerging from the rubble, holding a rifle. The caption read, 'We will not lay down our weapons.' However, in a parallel report, Al-Akhbar acknowledged that Israel had managed to secure through the cease-fire agreement what it had failed to achieve during the fighting. Cited sources indicated that Israel would continue to 'occupy five points, just like the 13 points it occupied since 2006'— referring to 18 points that 'may not be part of the land demarcation that the U.S. promised after the war.' Lebanese President Michel Aoun, according to the sources, requested international support from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, the U.S. and France to change the decision allowing Israel to maintain its presence in certain southern villages. He argued that 'Israel’s continued presence in the south means the possibility of war again,' and that it cannot be guaranteed that Hezbollah 'won’t resume its activities.' He added, 'Lebanon has committed to the agreement it signed, but Israel insists on violating it, and the countries that guaranteed the agreement must intervene.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy4luvz51g	2025-02-18T14:17:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/SJggh77fckx/SJggh77fckx_0_191_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Some hostage families are still waiting to learn if their loved o...	Families anxiously await confirmation of whether their loved ones are alive or dead, as six hostages are set to be freed Saturday; Meanwhile, Israel prepares to identify and bury victims whose remains will be returned in the coming days; 'How can they not tell us anything? How can they leave us to figure it out on our own?' The families of Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen, Tal Shoham, Avera Mengistu, and Hisham al-Sayed have been informed that their loved ones will be released alive on Saturday. These will be the final living hostages released as part of Phase I of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. However, 14 hostages remain to be released in Phase I, and for some no official information has been provided. The Bibas family stated on Tuesday evening they are aware of Hamas' announcement that Shiri, Kfir and Ariel Bibas will be returned during the exchange of bodies on Thursday. However, they clarified that they have not received an official confirmation on the matter from Israeli authorities. The same applies to the family of hostage Itzhak Elgarat and to Shlomo Mansour, who the IDF recently confirmed was killed on October 7. According to the agreement, four deceased hostages will be returned this Thursday, and four more next week. Danny Elgarat, Itzhak’s brother, said: 'I was contacted this morning and informed that six living hostages will arrive on Saturday, and four bodies will be returned on Thursday. They didn’t tell me anything beyond that, nor did they give me names. It’s not my job to calculate or draw conclusions about whether my brother is alive or not.' 'If they’re publishing the names of six living hostages, it means the rest are not alive — but no one in our family has been officially informed,' Danny added. 'The last update I have about Itzik is that there are serious concerns about his life, and until the state tells me otherwise that’s the situation as far as I’m concerned. But how can they not tell us anything? How can they leave us to figure it out on our own? This is a systemic failure — it’s an issue of emotional intelligence. We’ve been turned into objects. We’re no longer human beings.' The list of 14 hostages remaining in Phase I includes, in addition to Itzik Elgarat, Shlomo Mansour (who the IDF recently reported was killed on October 7), Oded Lifshitz (whose son said, 'The chances of him being alive are slim'), as well as Ohad Yahalomi and Tsahi Idan. Hadasa Lazar, Shlomo Mansour’s sister, told Ynet: 'We haven’t been informed about anything. We’re hearing rumors and updates about names being published. I contacted our officer, and she said they don’t know anything either — it might even happen on Thursday. Families of the living have already received their notifications, and Saturday feels so far away. But with the deceased, with the dead, we hear nothing. We’re stretched like a spring. They say four bodies are supposed to be returned, so I start planning —burial, shiva. It’s all so heartbreaking.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I want to remind the government that time has run out. It ran out a long time ago. They don’t have even a few more minutes to wait there,' she added. 'The prime minister should make a brave decision and bring them out. As long as the hostages are still there, I don’t see any victory. The prime minister said we’re on the brink of victory? Then I want to see them here. Then we can start rebuilding.' As part of the preparations for receiving the last six living hostages in Phase I of the deal, Israel is also preparing for another process: the identification and burial of those who will not return alive. According to the plan, Hamas will transfer the bodies to the Red Cross, which will hand them over to IDF. Bodies transferred to Israel will be taken to the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Abu Kabir, where they will be identified using advanced methods, including DNA sampling and dental imaging. Only after the identification process and definitive confirmation of the victims’ identities will military casualties be transferred to military rabbinate, and civilian casualties will be transferred to the Ministry of Religious Services. Once the dead have been identified, the 'bitter notification' team will be activated. This team, consisting of welfare professionals, police officers and IDF representatives, in collaboration with the Ministry of Religious Services and local authorities, will officially inform the families of the victims that their loved ones have been identified. Burial locations and funeral dates will then be arranged with the families according to their wishes. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkdl8ozc1e	2025-02-18T14:02:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/Hyb36QDSdkg/Hyb36QDSdkg_0_37_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Zuli and Liron Mor, who survived the October 7 massacre in Kfar Aza along with their children, adopted Abigail, Michael and Amalia the children of Smadar and Roy Edan, who were killed by the terrorists; 'Maybe one day we’ll return to normal life, but right now, we live with grief every single day. We have three orphans in our home' 'When hostages return home, the ordeal doesn’t end with their release,' according to Zuli and Liron Mor of Kibbutz Kfar Aza. The couple, who adopted the three children of Ynet photographer Roy Edan and his wife, Smadar, who were both murdered on October 7, 'believe this reality will be evident in those now returning from captivity.' Liron, Smadar’s sister, and her husband, Zuli, have taken in Michael, 10, Amalia, 7, who survived October 7 by hiding in a closet during the massacre, and Abigail, 5, who was kidnapped during the Hamas terror attack and later freed in the first hostage deal. They are now raising them alongside their own three children — 13-year-old twins Zohar and Inbar, and 11-year-old Daniela — all of whom survived the massacre with their parents. Abigail was three when she was abducted and after her parents were murdered she became one of the enduring symbols of the October 7 events. Months after her release in a hostage exchange, a photo of her in the arms of U.S. President Joe Biden touched hearts worldwide. 'The state tends to think that a year and three months after their return, people should just move on — but that’s light-years away from reality,' Zuli said. 'Maybe one day we’ll return to normal life, but right now, we live with grief every single day. We have three orphans in our home.' The couple stressed that even after a year or two, the government must recognize that the trauma doesn’t simply end. 'But amid all the sorrow and tragedy, these six children give us a reason to wake up every morning,' Liron asserts. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The couple also described the complexities of their blended family. 'There’s jealousy among the siblings — because that’s how they see themselves, as full siblings,' Liron explains. 'For example, when people ask about Abigail on the street, of course, she’s a symbol, but she also has five siblings who have endured unimaginable hardships. Everything revolves around her. But she’s just one piece of our family puzzle. It’s important for people to understand — we are a family with six children.' The Mors have learned to deflect difficult or insensitive questions, but they say five-year-old Abigail cannot. 'Even with the best intentions, a five-year-old doesn’t know how to handle certain questions. And some of them are completely inappropriate — like when people ask her, ‘What did you eat in Gaza?’' Zuli said.

Holocaust survivor Marian Turski dies aged 98	Holocaust survivor Marian Turski, who became a journalist in Poland and headed an international committee of Auschwitz survivors, has died at the age of 98, said the Polish weekly magazine Polityka, where he worked as a columnist. In an article on Tuesday announcing Turski's death, Polityka described him as 'an exceptional guardian of memory, an outstanding man whose voice was heard all over the world. He was sent to the Lodz ghetto at the age of 14 and in 1944 he was transported to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp where both his father and brother died. In 1945 he survived two death marches, first from Auschwitz to Buchenwald, Buchenwald to Theresienstadt, where he was liberated by the Soviet Red Army. After World War II Turski lived in Lower Silesia, southern Poland, before moving to Warsaw, where he worked as a historian and journalist. He started working at Polityka in 1958 and was the author of several books. In January, Turski gave a speech at the commemorations of the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz in which he warned against rising antisemitism. 'Let us not be afraid to convince ourselves that we can solve problems between neighbours.' Over 3 million of Poland's 3.3 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis. In all, between 1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically killed 6 million Jews across German-occupied Europe, along with gypsies, sexual minorities, disabled people and others who offended Nazi ideas of racial superiority.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkbpfuz9jg	2025-02-18T12:24:07-08:00

The younger generation has proven what the future could hold the...	Five Fingers pre-military academy in Zichron Yaakov is training the next generation of leaders, instilling values of combat, leadership and community service. 'We have the best youth with us,' says Dror Yanai, head of the academy, which has lost 17 of its graduates in the Iron Swords War. 'They will be the leaders of the future' 'The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again' once said Theodore Roosevelt (1910). On a chilly, slightly rainy morning, the dedicated trainees of the Five Fingers pre-military academy are already hard at work. Some set out early for a run in the surrounding hills of Zichron Yaakov, others clean facilities in Jerusalem, and soon they will leave for a week-long leadership and training program. No one is idle — everyone contributes, whether by preparing breakfast, handling laundry or organizing the day’s activities. Founded in 2014, Five Fingers is an educational-social movement with a mission to empower youth to reach their full physical and mental potential through training. With 2,500 members, the organization collaborates with the Ministry of Education, the IDF, and various business and sports organizations. Many of its graduates have taken on officer roles in the military. The movement was founded by Amir Menachem, a former Navy SEAL officer, along with his father, Yoram, a professional fitness coach who trained Israel’s top basketball teams. Their vision was to develop leadership among Israeli youth through resilience and physical activity. Training for leadership and excellence Dror Yanai, 34, a former Navy SEAL, runs the academy alongside Menachem. The two are deeply involved in shaping its programs and ensuring its graduates leave prepared for elite military service. 'This movement is about developing excellence, resilience and leadership among Israeli youth,' Yanai explains. 'We operate informally and formally, reaching thousands of trainees every year.' Established in 2018, the academy in Zichron Yaakov works closely with various institutions, including military units, schools and volunteer organizations. 'I get to meet incredible young people who are eager to contribute and give their all every day,' Yanai says. The academy receives over 2,500 applications annually, but only 60% are accepted. About 40% of participants are young women. The trainees go through rigorous physical training, leadership workshops, and educational programs covering history, sports science and Zionism Preparing for military and civic leadership One of the academy’s core programs, 'Carmel,' operates from August to March, providing an additional year of training for graduates who wish to lead social change. These young leaders integrate into 'Five Fingers' as coaches and facilitators, guiding younger participants in fitness and community initiatives. The academy’s headquarters is adorned with motivational quotes, including one from former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt: 'Run, touch the point, and give your best.' Yanai explains, 'The name 'Five Fingers' comes from the idea that if you can control all five fingers, you can maximize your potential.' The movement is built on five key values: professionalism, perseverance, adaptability, leadership and national commitment. 'We aim to instill a deep sense of responsibility and initiative in our trainees, ensuring they become proactive members of Israeli society,' Menachem emphasizes. Yanai, who is waiting for a meeting with donors for the new campus, adds: 'The 'Five Fingers' work method is based on a 'body-mind' approach, which develops physical and mental abilities in parallel. This is sometimes expressed through extreme and unexpected changes in the type of training, introducing mental exercises mid-intense workouts that test motivation, adaptability, and the ability to withstand challenges.' The movement operates in various fields and is divided into the youth program, the pre-military academy, and the alumni program. The youth program runs year-round in several groups across different locations in the country. It consists of 10 monthly sessions that include both individual and group work. These sessions feature physical training, lectures and enrichment activities, with a focus on building mental resilience, instilling values, enhancing physical fitness and promoting awareness of a healthy lifestyle. 'Look at the trainees here — they are all enjoying themselves together, and, most importantly, they are succeeding in contributing. That is what truly matters to all of us here,' Yanai proudly adds. 'At the beginning, the movement relied on the personal financial investment of its founders. Gradually, as it grew, it became more established and is now funded through participation fees from its members. There is immense demand to join us.' Menachem adds: 'Most of those who join are driven by the desire to prepare for combat service, with the goal of strengthening themselves physically and mentally, and above all, being ready for selection and elite unit tryouts.' The war’s impact and rising motivation Following the October 7th attack and the Iron Swords war, the academy rapidly mobilized a volunteer operation to support evacuees and soldiers. 'We established an emergency command center to aid displaced families and reservists in combat zones. At first, one operations center was set up at the movement’s headquarters in Herzliya, and another at the academy in Zichron Yaakov. Later, the academy relocated its main activities to Eilat to support children from evacuated families in the Gaza border communities, providing them with a social framework during this period,' explains Yanai. 'During the war, there was a sharp increase in the number of applicants to the movement. Most of the trainers were called up for reserve duty, and the movement quickly trained new instructors from among its graduates. At the same time, as mentioned, throughout the war, the movement mourned the loss of 17 of its graduates — officers and soldiers who fell in battle, most of them from elite units. They were the first fallen members of Five Fingers since the movement began operating.' 'From the moment the war began, they didn’t think about themselves — they only thought about how to help,' Menachem says, his voice heavy with emotion. 'I knew most of the fallen personally. It’s heartbreaking, but we’re committed to honoring them by continuing their mission. And now, we are establishing the campus in their memory. It will include a large memorial site alongside content creation and current affairs.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Yanai continues: 'We have the most outstanding and value-driven youth here in the country. They will be the future leaders of society. As someone who works extensively with young people, I see teenagers who are eager to make a meaningful impact — they are hungry and curious. The reality of the war, as well as the situation in the country before it, has awakened them. I see an incredible level of enthusiasm among the youth. There is a massive number of boys and girls who want to train. I’m talking about trainees from 6th grade to 12th grade who come to training sessions with extremely high motivation.' Despite the war’s toll, interest in Five Fingers has surged. 'More young people are stepping up, eager to train and serve,' Yanai notes. 'We see an incredible shift — youth who once aimed for technology units are now focused on combat service, aspiring to join special forces and infantry battalions.' 'This is a generation with immense motivation and a deep sense of care,' according to Menachem. 'The moment this war began, we saw the mobilization of civil society across the entire nation, and just as importantly, we saw it in the younger generation. They are strong, value-driven, and willing to pay the price. I believe this generation has also proven what kind of future this country can have — once they are given the reins to lead and guide the nation forward.' 'The people are living in a much more united way. We want to contribute, to share the burden, but in the political world, there are interests that overshadow what is truly happening on the ground,' he continues. 'In the end, we look at ourselves — where we can make an impact, where we can contribute. Our responsibility, our sense of giving, and our commitment to continue serving remain strong. Here, we have trainees with incredible mental resilience. They go through extraordinary experiences, learning and gaining deep self-awareness, and then they go on to serve in the IDF’s top units, making an even greater and more meaningful contribution to our country.' A generation ready to lead Dikla Zarko, 18, a former ballet dancer from Kfar Saba, joined the academy after her cousin, a Five Fingers graduate, was killed in combat. 'At first, I just wanted to dance, but after his death, I knew I had to be here and contribute to the country,' she shares. These days, while setting goals for her future service in the IDF, she is also considering continuing for a second year. 'When Rif arrived at the academy and loved it so much, he told me about all the activities they do here — the enrichment, the volunteer work,' Zarko recalls. 'I realized that dancing is important, but coming here and contributing to the country is far more meaningful. And then the tragedy struck—dear Rif was killed in Gaza. At that moment, I knew I had to be here and dedicate myself to serving our people.' 'We spent a week of activities in Eilat, learning a lot and volunteering. Now, we are preparing for a week of activities in Jerusalem,' she adds. 'We come here with a deep desire to give, to serve the country, and to develop our values. That is truly what matters most — to give back, especially after the devastating tragedy that struck us all on October 7th.' In closing, she adds: 'I will always remember Rif as a kind-hearted, caring, friendly, and sensitive person who was deeply connected to those around him. I am here because of him — because it was important for me to continue his path in the place he loved so much.' Adam Meital, 18, from Tel Aviv also found new purpose at the academy. 'I didn’t know much about this place before, but I looked into it and decided to join. The experience here is tough but incredibly rewarding,' he says. 'I feel ready to serve and make a difference.' 'The young generation has proven itself,' Menachem concludes. 'They are determined, values-driven and ready to take on the future. The moment they are given the reins, they will lead this country forward.' While political divisions exist, Five Fingers fosters unity through service. 'In the end, it’s about looking at where we can contribute, how we can build resilience, and how we can strengthen our country together,' Yanai says. 'These young men and women are experiencing incredible personal growth and are preparing to give back in the most meaningful way possible — through dedicated service to Israel.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/r1syhlm5yl	2025-02-18T11:45:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/12/BJgVkL8qYkl/BJgVkL8qYkl_0_108_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Pope Francis has pneumonia in both lungs, Vatican says	Pope Francis has shown the onset of double pneumonia, further complicating treatment for the 88-year pontiff, the Vatican said on Tuesday. 'The laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and clinical conditions of the Holy Father continue to present a complex picture,' said a statement. '(A) chest CAT scan which the Holy Father received this afternoon ... showed the onset of bilaterial pneumonia that requires further pharmacological therapy,' it added. 'The laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and clinical conditions of the Holy Father continue to present a complex picture,' said a statement. '(A) chest CAT scan which the Holy Father received this afternoon ... showed the onset of bilaterial pneumonia that requires further pharmacological therapy,' it added. Bilaterial pneumonia is an infection that affects both lungs, and can make breathing difficult. Francis has been suffering from a respiratory infection for more than a week and was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on February 14. He is especially prone to lung infections because as a young adult he developed pleurisy and had part of one lung removed. A Vatican official speaking on background earlier in the day, said the pontiff had not been put on a ventilator and was breathing on his own. Ahead of the latest statement, the Vatican announced that all public events on the pope's calendar had been cancelled through Sunday. The Vatican has said Francis will stay in hospital for as long as necessary. It has not specified whether the pope is suffering from a bacterial or viral infection.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s10z1wf9yl	2025-02-18T10:30:40-08:00

These are the 6 living hostages to be released on Saturday | Read...	The families of the six remaining living hostages from Phase 1 of hostage deal have been notified their loved ones will be released on Saturday; Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed will be released after more than a decade in captivity; Eliya Cohen, Omer Wenkert, Omer Sham Tov, Tal Shoham have endured 505 days in what their families describe as hell The families of Eliya Cohen, Omer Wenkert, Omer Sham Tov, Tal Shoham, Avera Mengistu, and Hisham al-Sayed have been informed that they will be released alive from Hamas captivity this Saturday. Here are their stories as they prepare to leave the horrors of captivity behind. Eliya Cohen kidnapped from the 'shelter of death' Ziv Abud, the girlfriend of hostage Eliya Cohen, celebrated the news of his return Tuesday, writing on Instagram, 'Eliya is coming home!' Cohen had attended the Nova music festival with Abud, his nephew Amit ben Avida, and Amit’s girlfriend, Karin Shwarcman. When the Hamas terror attack began, the four took cover in a rocket shelter that later earned its grim nickname the 'shelter of death'. Ben Avida and Shwarcman were murdered, and Cohen was taken hostage. After the abduction, Abud learned that Cohen had planned to propose and had already purchased a ring. Last week Abud revealed that testimony from former captives suggested Cohen was unaware she was still alive. Cohen’s mother, Sigi, recently expressed horror over the dire conditions in which her son and Alon Ohel were being held. After the previous hostage release two weeks ago, Ahiel’s family received proof of life from him and disclosed the appalling conditions he and Cohen endured, including being chained. In March, Abud walked through the streets of Tel Aviv while much of Israel celebrated Purim. She wore a yellow dress adorned with iron chains and pictures of hostages. At the center of the dress was a bleeding heart with Cohen’s photo. 'Instead of standing under a wedding canopy in a white dress, I’m wearing yellow and holding a sign — my fiancé is a hostage in Gaza,' she said at the time. Omer Wenkert’s last message to his family Omer Wenkert and his friends arrived at the Nova music festival just an hour before the Hamas attack began. His final message to his family sent at 7:01 a.m. on Oct. 7, read: 'I’m terrified.' The eldest of three children, Wenkert was diagnosed with colitis at 14, making him particularly vulnerable in captivity. His mother described him as 'a wonderful brother with a special bond with his siblings —always smiling, friendly, and a people magnet.' Passionate about food, he invested both time and money into learning the industry, working his way up to managing a fine-dining restaurant. His dream was to become a food critic. Eight grenades were thrown into the shelter where Wenkert was hiding. Kim was murdered, and Wenkert was among the few who survived.

Passionate about food, he invested both time and money into learning the industry, working his way up to managing a fine-dining restaurant. His dream was to become a food critic. Omer Shem Tov was held with freed hostages Omer Shem Tov, 22, from Herzliya, was kidnapped from the Nova festival and held in captivity alongside Itay and Maya Regev, who were freed in the November 2023 hostage deal. His father, Malachi, told Ynet, 'I hope he knows we’re moving heaven and earth for him, that he’s not alone. I imagine him imagining it, sensing that we’re making enormous efforts. I wish I could send him a message to give him strength, some kind of sign.' When humanitarian groups arranged for medication to be sent to hostages, his family ensured an inhaler was included for him. 'I kept imagining that if he suddenly received an inhaler, he’d know — it would be the biggest sign that we’re doing everything to bring him home,' his father said. Tal Shoham was taken with his family Tal Shoham was abducted into Gaza along with his wife, Adi, their two young children, Neve and Yahal, his mother-in-law, and two other relatives. All were released in the previous hostage deal in 2023, but Shoham remained in captivity. On his birthday, his relative Shira Baron wrote: 'For 116 days, our lives have been defined by a relentless countdown, each day a battle to keep shouting for the hostages' immediate return. Every day is a challenge for them — a real life-or-death situation. And they are our people, our family, the ones who are essential to our lives.' Avera Mengistu: A decade in captivity On Sept. 7, 2014 — two weeks after the end of the Israel-Gaza war—Avera Mengistu crossed the border near Zikim Beach into Gaza and was taken captive. Last August, for his 38th birthday, supporters released yellow balloons in Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square in his honor. His father, Aylin, told reporters, 'For nearly 10 years, I have prayed for my son to come home.' Gil Elias, a family member, described Mengistu as a shy and reserved man with a kind heart. 'People don’t know that Avera is someone who always smiled, someone his friends loved. He would do anything for them. What many don’t realize is how deeply he was affected by his brother’s death — it left him in a state of confusion. That’s when we first saw signs of his mental struggles.' Hisham al-Sayed: Years without a sign of life Hisham al-Sayed, who has struggled with mental health issues, has been held by Hamas since 2015 after crossing the border into Gaza. His family and Israeli officials confirmed that he had crossed the border multiple times before. In 2022 — seven years into his captivity — Hamas released a video of him for the first time. His mother, Manal, recalled, 'I was relieved to see him, but I could tell he wasn’t well.' His father, Shaaban, added: 'In Islam, people with mental illnesses are not held accountable under religious law. Even God does not judge them.' Since then, the family has been demanding his unconditional release. 'He has nothing to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,' they said. 'He should be freed immediately.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1mp7eg91e	2025-02-18T09:42:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/Sy37JEf9kx/Sy37JEf9kx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
We hit the ground and then flipped over': Watch Delta plane cras...	A Delta Airlines plane crash-landed in snowy Toronto, flipping over and catching fire; All 80 passengers and crew survived, with only 18 injured: 'People were sort of hanging and needed help to get down,' said a passenger New videos from Canada, released on Tuesday, document the crash of a Delta Airlines plane a day before in Toronto. Miraculously, the crash resulted in no fatalities, with only 18 injured out of the 80 passengers and crew members on board. In one video from Toronto's Pearson International Airport, the plane is seen approaching the runway covered in heavy accumulated snow. Upon contact with the ground, sparks can be seen, followed by flames engulfing the aircraft, thick smoke rising, and then the plane flipping over. Another video, filmed by a passenger inside the plane, shows the evacuation process: a woman is seen exiting through the aisle, supported by people waiting outside, followed by the person filming. Once outside in the snow, the passenger looks around and exclaims, 'Oh my God! Wow, I was on that plane!' The plane is shown flipped on its back with some scorch marks, as more passengers continue to evacuate one by one. The crash occurred on Monday at 2:23 p.m. local time, at the end of an 86-minute flight from Minneapolis. The plane carried 76 passengers and four crew members. Only 18 were injured, three of them seriously, including a child. In total, 15 required hospitalization, though some were released home within several hours. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Even now, the cause of the crash remains unknown. Following the incident, dozens of flights scheduled to depart from or land at Pearson Airport were delayed. Prior to the crash, there were already flight delays due to severe weather conditions and heavy snow in the area. Around the time of the crash-landing, the airport and its surroundings experienced strong winds and freezing temperatures. Over the past few days, a snowstorm has hit the region, resulting in 8.6 inches of snow accumulating at the airport. One of the passengers, John Nelson, who shared a video of the crash aftermath, told CNN that there was no indication of anything wrong before landing. 'We hit the ground and then flipped over,' he said. 'I managed to release my seatbelt and kind of fell and pushed myself toward the ground. People were sort of hanging and needed help to get down, while others managed to get down on their own.' Michael J. McCormick, an aviation management expert, stated that a situation in which a plane flips completely and lands on its roof is extremely rare. He emphasized that the fact that 80 people survived such an event is a testament to the advancements in aviation engineering and technology. According to him, not long ago, an incident like this would have resulted in multiple fatalities. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1uubvg91x	2025-02-18T09:23:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/SJivBbM5yl/SJivBbM5yl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu confidant Ron Dermer to lead Phase II of cease-fire, ho...	He will replace the heads of the Shin Bet and Mossad, according to a political source; Hamas will free 6 living hostages on Saturday as Israel opens negotiations on the next phase, which will end the war; 'We have raised demands based on the goals of the war - if Hamas refuses we will return to fighting in a forceful and deadly manner, and with full backing from Trump' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has appointed his close confidant, Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, to lead negotiations on the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage-return deal, alongside President Donald Trump's special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. Prior to this, Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and Mossad chief Dedi Barnea led the talks. After the announcement that the last six living hostages set to be released in Phase I - Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, Tal Shoham, Eliya Cohen, Avraham Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed - would be freed on Saturday, an Israeli official said Wednesday evening that this was 'an important achievement by Netanyahu, which was done in full coordination with the United States.' The same source said that 'the prime minister once again managed to shorten the pace of the release and reach an agreement on the return of all the living hostages for Phase I as early as this week, in addition to the return of the dead hostages. If the agreement is realized, Israel will complete Phase I of the agreement and guarantee the return of all the hostages from this stage, an achievement that not many thought would happen.' He said that as part of the negotiations, Israel had approved allowing 'only a small number' of caravans and heavy equipment into Gaza. 'This will in no way change the feasibility of implementing Trump's plan for voluntary immigration and creating another Gaza, to which Prime Minister Netanyahu is fully committed,' he claimed. The source added that Israel will enter negotiations on Phase II in the coming days, which is - as he put it - 'a political phase that deals with the question of the conditions for ending the war. Accordingly, the one who will lead the efforts on behalf of Israel is the Minister of Strategic Affairs, Ron Dermer, and he will do so with the U.S. president's special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff.' He further noted that 'Israel will raise its security demands during the negotiations, based on the war goals determined by the political-security cabinet. If Israel is forced to return to fighting in Gaza in light of Hamas' refusal, it will do so forcefully and lethally and with the full backing of the Trump administration, a renewed stockpile of weapons that has been released, fresh forces and a completely different way of fighting.' The source's announcement came after the breakthrough achieved Tuesday, in which Hamas agreed to release the six remaining living hostages as part of Phase I on Saturday. In addition, on Thursday, Hamas will return four dead hostages - with four more dead to be returned in another round of relelases next week. Israel has been pressing in recent days to bring forward the release of the live hostages; according to the original outline, only three were supposed to be released on Saturday and another three next week Sources among the mediators told the Wall Street Journal that this was made possible after Israel agreed to open negotiations on Phase II and to allow the entry of caravans to provide shelter for displaced Gazans. In recent days, there has been talk in Israel that hundreds of caravans will be agreed upon, even though the original agreement stipulated that 60,000 caravans (in addition to 200,000 tents) would enter Gaza in Phase I. Hamas has so far accused Israel of violating the agreement due to the delay in providing shelters for the displaced, and the caravan issue was at the center of the crisis last week. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: For Hamas, the advance release of the living hostages is also a prelude to Israel's release of Palestinian terrorists: Hamas claimed Tuesday evening that 602 Palestinian prisoners will be released on Saturday. Some 445 of them are residents of the Gaza Strip who were arrested after October 7, 50 who were sentenced to life imprisonment, 60 who were sentenced to long prison sentences, and 47 who were released in the Shalit deal. Another 108 prisoners will be deported to Egypt as a first stop, before being transferred to other countries, including 13 prisoners who suffer from serious medical problems. Negotiations on Phase II of the deal are expected to be very complicated, and Israel has already made it clear that it will demand the demilitarization of the Strip and a guarantee that Hamas will not be able to control it. Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said that Israel will demand in the negotiations that the Palestinian Authority also not be present in the Strip 'the day after.' Hamas has signaled that it will agree to formally give up control of the Gaza government, but according to estimates it is not expected to make demands such as disarmament or the exile of its leaders - so it is unclear how an agreement can be reached on Phase II, in which all the remaining living hostages are supposed to be released. Trump's envoy to the region, Witkoff, made it clear that the U.S. is determined to reach the second phase . 'We intend to succeed, we are leaving no one behind,' he said Sunday night at an event in Miami alongside captivity survivor Noa Argamani. So far, as part of Phase I of the deal, 19 Israeli hostages have been released and, in addition - as part of a separate agreement with the Thai government - five Thai citizens who were kidnapped on October 7 have also been released. After the release of the remaining 14 hostages as part of Phase I - six living who will be released on Saturday and eight dead who will be released in two additional stages on Thursday and next week - 59 hostages will remain in Gaza, including at least 28 dead hostages. The dead who remain in Gaza after Phase I are supposed to be handed over to Israel as part of the deal's outline only in Phase III, which also includes the long-term reconstruction of the Strip. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkd5urmqke	2025-02-18T09:05:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/03/BJcMzhROyl/BJcMzhROyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Interceptor fired at malfunctioning IDF drone over fear it would ...	Fearing it would lose a drone inside Lebanese territory, the IDF launched an interceptor on the day its forces withdrew from most of southern Lebanon An interceptor was launched Tuesday afternoon from the Mount Hermon area, apparently targeting an Israeli Air Force drone that experienced a malfunction and was at risk of crashing in Lebanese territory. The incident occurred on the same day the IDF completed its full withdrawal from nearly all of southern Lebanon. After a two-month cease-fire and an extension, the last remaining Israeli troops are expected to finalize their withdrawal — except from five strategic locations. Earlier in the day, Lebanese media released footage showing IDF troops preparing controlled demolitions in villages they were vacating.

US, Russia agree to restore diplomatic missions	The U.S. and Russia agreed on Tuesday to restore the normal functioning of each other's diplomatic missions, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said after talks between senior U.S. and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia. The move appeared to signal a significant easing of restrictions on Russian diplomatic missions in the United States that were imposed by past U.S. administrations over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and other Russian actions. The Riyadh talks were aimed as a step toward ending Russia's war in Ukraine after President Donald Trump, who took office last month, ordered top officials to begin negotiations. Rubio said the sides agreed as a first step to appoint teams of officials to 'work very quickly to re-establish the functionality of our respective missions.' The two countries have expelled diplomats and limited the appointment of new staff at each other's missions in a series of tit-for-tat measures over the past decade, leaving their respective embassies thinly staffed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rylesvgqjx	2025-02-18T07:53:51-08:00

Former chief rabbi Yona Metzger investigated for indecent act wit...	Metzger, previously convicted of bribery and fraud, is being investigated for a new complaint of indecent acts involving a minor; Police are also revisiting past sexual misconduct allegations, though no formal charges have been filed Former Chief Rabbi Yona Metzger was questioned on Tuesday on suspicion of committing an indecent act against a minor under the age of 16. The investigation against Metzger, a 71-year-old resident of Tel Aviv, was initiated by the Fraud Unit of the Tel Aviv District Police following a complaint received by the police. In November 2020, Metzger was investigated on suspicion of sexual offenses, but the case was closed by the prosecution. On Tuesday, he was questioned again regarding that case as well as a new complaint received recently. At the end of the investigation, Metzger was released on bail, and the investigation into his case is ongoing. Metzger’s questioning coincided with Election Day for the Chief Rabbinate Council. In the past, he was convicted as part of a plea deal for bribery and fraud offenses and was sentenced to prison. Additionally, he was fined $1.4 million. During his tenure as Chief Rabbi of Israel, from 2003 to 2013, and subsequent to that, Metzger allegedly accepted significant financial benefits from private individuals in exchange for actions related to his position, according to the indictment. These benefits were received on numerous occasions, both during private events and as compensation for his participation in events organized by those providing the benefits. For example, during the wedding of his son in July 2010, financial benefits were allegedly provided. In a conversation that took place before the wedding between Metzger's driver and two invited guests, it was agreed that the two individuals would provide a substantial benefit to Metzger in the form of a 'gift' for the wedding. Accordingly, a payment of $500,000 was transferred directly to Metzger in ten cash installments. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: While serving as Chief Rabbi of Israel, allegations of sexual harassment against Metzger were published in the media. Reports at the time included testimonies from men who had met with him and claimed that he had touched them against their will. However, this information was never filed with the police as an official complaint and was not investigated. At the time, Metzger’s associates claimed he had undergone polygraph tests at two separate institutions and was found truthful. 'Prominent rabbinical figures are willing to stoop to any level, fabricating blatant lies and false accusations. After failing with allegations regarding women, they moved on to allegations concerning men, and the next step will likely involve accusations concerning animals,' an associate said. 'Only a police investigation will expose those behind these complaints and reveal the truth.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h15ptxzqje	2025-02-18T07:37:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/03/06/9103217/9103217_0_0_1280_853_0_small.jpg

South Tel Aviv residents petition court to end Eritrean asylum-se...	Petition to the Jerusalem District Court calls to end policy and deport regime supporters, citing evidence that many Eritreans have returned home safely Dozens of South Tel Aviv residents, along with the Israeli Immigration Policy Center, have filed a precedent-setting petition with the Jerusalem District Court demanding the cancellation of Israel’s group protection policy for Eritrean asylum-seekers and the deportation of regime supporters. The petition follows a report by Ynet that revealed an 80,000-shekel bond paid by the Eritrean Embassy in Israel to secure the release of pro-regime detainees — raising serious doubts about claims that Eritreans face danger if they return to their home country. The petition argues that for nearly 20 years Israel has allowed thousands of Eritrean asylum-seekers to stay, despite evidence that many have returned to Eritrea safely. According to data from the Population and Immigration Authority cited in the petition, more than 4,000 asylum-seekers have returned home with state assistance. The petitioners claim the group protection policy is illegal, 'contrary to common sense,' and lacks any legal foundation. The petitioners point to what they call the absurdity of the policy, highlighted by violent clashes between pro- and anti-regime Eritreans in September 2023. Despite openly declaring their support for the regime — from which they supposedly fled — pro-regime asylum-seekers were released from detention. One notable case mentioned is that of Eritrean national Dawit Debes, who admitted in court that he came to Israel for work, supports the Eritrean regime, and only remained due to financial constraints, not security concerns. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Following Ynet's exposé, the petitioners demanded the re-detention and deportation of pro-regime asylum-seekers, arguing that their release was unlawful and that the group protection policy itself contradicts Israeli law. They further allege that the policy has allowed violent criminals to be released without proper risk assessments and has encouraged migrants from other African countries to pose as Eritreans to secure protected status. Meanwhile, Knesset member Yulia Malinovsky of the Yisrael Beiteinu party has advanced a bill to deport regime-supporting asylum-seekers. The bill passed a preliminary reading in the Knesset last week with 51 votes in favor and none opposed. 'The first step toward restoring security and peace for South Tel Aviv residents began today,' Malinovsky said after the vote. 'Israeli citizens should not have to fear leaving their homes after dark. I visited South Tel Aviv this week and saw the chaos firsthand. Pro-regime Eritrean asylum-seekers are the main drivers of crime in the area. They are here as asylum seekers while supporting the regime — so there is no threat to their safety if they return home.' According to the proposed legislation, an asylum-seeker who directly or indirectly supports their home country's regime could be deported if the interior minister is convinced of their affiliation after giving them a chance to respond. Attorney Yonatan Jakubowicz, founder of the Israeli Immigration Policy Center and one of the petition’s initiators, said: 'It’s time to end this outrageous absurdity, enforce the law, and restore logic to Israel's immigration policy. The state has documented conversations with hundreds of infiltrators who returned to Eritrea and confirmed they were not harmed. The fact that pro-regime supporters are being released based on a supposed fear of persecution while their own government posts bail for them is the height of absurdity. We hope the court will order their deportation, bringing back some sense of security to South Tel Aviv residents and strengthening the rule of law in Israel.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sywcgkg51e	2025-02-18T06:11:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/09/02/B1grOngR3/B1grOngR3_0_133_2560_1442_0_small.jpg

Older brothers of captives Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Eviater David say watching hostages unite with their families prompts mixed emotions and joy will never be complete until both little brothers return Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Eviater David have been best friends from early childhood. They were at the Nova music festival when the Hamas massacre began on Oct. 7, they hid together, were discovered by the terrorists together and were abducted by together to Gaza. Gal, Guy's brother was also at Nova. He managed to escape. Now he and Eviatar's brother Ilay, see it as their life's mission to bring their younger brothers back home. 'We are now connected by our common goal and it is the strongest connection possible,' they say. 'We are fighting for the lives of our little brothers.' Ilay travels around the country to meet Israelis who do not come to Hostage square. He speaks of the abduction and of Ron Tzarfati and Idan Haramati, also friends, who were murdered in the massacre. Gal focuses on the international arena. 'We each do what we can do best,' Gal says. Now both are in the United States to meet with officials in the administration and urge them to push for a completion of the cease-fire deal. 'We understood that that is where we should concentrate our efforts.' Their journey has made the two older brothers very close. 'Of all the family members we are the most connected,' Gal says. 'Sometimes we talk about what we would do if one of them returns first. Even if we could be certain that the other would follow, it would be insanely tough. We don't want half of a celebration. We want real happiness, knowing they are both home and we can begin to heal.' From the evidence they had gathered, Gal and Ilay now know that Guy and Eviatar reached their car when the terrorists were already battling police forces and were in the line of fire. 'The managed to reach the open fields past highway 232 but had to abandon their car when they came under gunfire from terrorists. There were people there who were running and falling, and the two friends were able to help some of them escape until they themselves were shot,' Gal says. They hid under a bush near the road and according to the police investigation, the terrorists stormed it and abducted all seven people seeking shelter there.' Ilay adds that they were there for over an hour. 'They heard and saw everything. The masses of terrorists, the screams, shootings explosions,' he says. 'At 9:30 AM they were discovered, bound, blindfolded and put on a pick up that took them to Gaza. By 11 AM, a video of them inside the Strip, already spread on social media.' The cease-fire deal is critical to both. 'I always try to be realistic,' Gal says. 'With all the pain involved, I understood that the two would not be included in the first phase of the deal because they are young men who would be considered worthwhile assets to Hamas.' But watching hostages reunite with their families has prompted mixed emotions. 'There are days that are more difficult, and I struggle to function,' Gal says. 'I am happy and also angry. I love and hate them at the same time. What would I not give to be in their place? Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ilay does not watch the releases live.

Cleaning house: Musk fires FDA employees overseeing Neuralink	Cutting comes as part of Musk's U.S. Department of Government Efficiency position aimed at improving processes under Trump's new administration Several U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) employees who reviewed Elon Musk’s brain implant company, Neuralink, were fired over the weekend as part of a broader federal workforce purge led by the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which Musk heads. Two sources told Reuters that about 20 employees from the FDA’s office of neurological and physical medicine devices, some involved with Neuralink-related matters, were among those let go. However, the sources did not believe the employees were targeted specifically for their work on Neuralink approvals. The cuts raised concerns about the FDA’s ability to efficiently and safely process medical device applications, including those from Neuralink. 'It’s intimidating to the FDA professionals who are overseeing Neuralink’s trial,' said Victor Krauthamer, a former acting director in the agency’s brain implant trials division. 'We should be worried about the whole trial, and the protection of the people in the trial,' he added. The FDA, the White House and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Musk, who spent over $250 million supporting U.S. President Donald Trump’s reelection bid, has led efforts to slash government spending, including at agencies regulating his companies like Tesla and SpaceX. His involvement in mass federal layoffs and access to federal databases have sparked criticism, particularly from Democrats, who accused him of lacking transparency regarding his businesses while shutting down agencies such as USAID, which resulted in halting HIV medication shipments to third-world countries. Trump, asked multiple times about Musk’s role, assured that Musk would address any conflicts of interest. The two developed a close relationship during his election campaign. Reports even suggested Musk had moved into a rental home linked to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The layoffs affected FDA scientists reviewing experimental medical device applications. Employees on probation — typically with less than one or two years of service — were hit hardest, as they have fewer legal protections. Neuralink is testing its brain implant, which would allow paralyzed patients to control digital devices with their thoughts. The company is also developing an implant to restore vision. Last year, the FDA designated the device for expedited review. Musk previously announced the first implantation of Neuralink’s chip in a human, although months later, the company reported electrode malfunctions reducing signal reception. 'The chip would enable control of your phone or computer, and through them almost any device, just by thinking,' Musk said. 'Initial users will be those who have lost the use of their limbs.' Neuralink received FDA approval for its first human clinical trial in May 2023. A month later, Musk said the company planned to implant its chip in a quadriplegic patient. He previously demonstrated successful implantation in a monkey, saying the animal could play video games using only its mind. The FDA termination letters cited performance-related reasons, though the employees had received top evaluations weeks earlier, according to sources. Musk’s team did not consult the FDA managers of the fired employees, who only learned about the dismissals afterward. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1r0jtw51e	2025-02-18T01:34:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/02/01/r1QD8Fjuca/r1QD8Fjuca_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
We're here for you': Israeli project provides therapy for Jews a...	Planetherapy, launched by Ilana O’Malley after the Hamasmassacre gives Jews and Israelis abroad who are affected, the help they need to face trauma and restore mental health In the wake of Hamas’ October 7 attacks, Ilana O’Malley, founder of Planetherapy, saw the urgent need for emotional support. Initially, she made phone calls to comfort those affected, including a friend’s daughter whose boyfriend went missing after the Nova music festival massacre. During one such call, O’Malley’s husband, who doesn’t speak Hebrew, unexpectedly joined the conversation. 'Oh, hello,' he said, unaware of the gravity of the situation. Yet, his presence had a profound impact, showing the power of human connection. As he spoke, the girl straightened up and started talking. A mission born from tragedy 'I looked at my husband and he was sweating. He said to me, ‘Oh my God, I get it now. I understand.’' The moment inspired O’Malley to gather professional therapists from around the world to offer support. 'It just started with, ‘Let’s get five people,’ and it went viral. Now we have hundreds of therapists from 35 countries, speaking 22 languages — Jews, non-Jews, Israelis living abroad. It’s amazing.' One of Planetherapy’s therapists, London-based psychologist Bat-Chen Shahar offers speech therapy tailored to individual needs. 'I was trained in Israel, but I’ve been in London for the last eight years,' she said. 'Therapy really depends on the specific client and what they need, but usually it’s around trauma. Sometimes it’s something directly from October 7 or it’s something from before that has resurfaced. Everything just feels too much.' O’Malley noted an increasing demand for mental health services, citing Israeli reports marking a 900% rise in cases. 'We spoke about it last night in one of our group sessions. I keep seeing articles from Israel on the rise of the mental health crisis. Channel 13 reported a 900% increase.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Despite this, many people remain unaware of Planetherapy’s services. 'It’s crucial to spread the word. We’re here for you. We’re giving six sessions for free and even after that, it’s so cheap — only 25 euros.' Sessions are available in multiple languages, including Hebrew and English, catering to Israelis and Jewish communities abroad. 'Even if they haven’t reached out to us yet, we want them to know we’re here whenever they’re ready.' Shahar stressed that Planetherapy serves as a reminder that people are fundamentally good and willing to support one another. 'We want to connect. We are here for each other, regardless of where you are, what language you speak, what your religion is or where you live. Planetherapy is a place where you can speak about everything.' Planetherapy benefits from the expertise of Prof. Craig Katz, a mental health professional with experience from the 9/11 terror attack. 'In our first conversation, he told me, ‘Wow, you’re throwing me back to 23 years ago.’ And I said, ‘Craig, you know what? We’re going to be your little sisters. Just guide us and tell us how to do it.’' Katz advised a step-by-step approach, cautioning against rushing to help everyone at once. 'When you’re a therapist, you want to help everybody. You want to go big. But he keeps me grounded — ‘Slow down. Step by step. Make sure it’s perfect.’' O’Malley, who resides in Spain, actively promotes Planetherapy worldwide. 'I speak everywhere — even when I go in the sauna!' she laughed. 'I was going to talk about the leaders of Spain — the King and everyone.' She also met with Spain’s leadership, including King Felipe VI, who deeply acknowledged the impact of the attacks. 'He was lovely. He actually said the names of the Spanish-speaking people who were killed on October 7. I was blown away by how much he knew and how he spoke about it in front of everyone. His heart was with us. It was really felt.' With hundreds of therapists volunteering from around the world, Planetherapy continues to expand its reach. O’Malley and Shahar remain committed to ensuring those affected by trauma receive the support they need, wherever they are. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bk600r0w5kx	2025-02-18T01:27:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/B1gkYRZ5ke/B1gkYRZ5ke_88_0_346_195_0_small.jpg

Terror group demands heavy equipment, caravans enter Strip; cabinet decides to concentrate on completing 1st phase and not to mandate delegation to move toward the second phase since there is no agreement among ministers regarding an end to the war A Hamas official six Israeli hostages would be freed on Saturday. The official told Ynet that the decision depends on what price Israel was willing to pay. 'Our demand now is that Israel enters phase two negotiations and commits to the humanitarian protocol including caravans and heavy machinery into the Strip.' According to the official the commitment must come from the Egyptian and Qatari mediators. But the security cabinet in its meeting late on Monday, decided to concentrate on completing the first phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal and not to mandate the Israeli delegation to the negotiations to move toward the second phase because there is no agreement among ministers regarding an end to the war. The delegation was given a 'general mandate' to prevent the first phase from being disrupted. Israel is seeking a weeks-long extension of the phase. Arab media reported that heavy equipment began moving from Egypt toward the Kerem Shalom border crossing into Gaza. They are meant to be used to remove rubble and open roads. Egyptian media said the heavy machinery was destined for the rebuilding of Gaza and would enter the Strip through the Rafah crossing. Israel has not confirmed the reports. Hamas was expected to transfer the remains of four dead hostages on Thursday, through the Red Cross. At least three live hostages are to be released on Saturday but Israel has sought to increase that number to six. In exchange Israel would allow caravans in, that could house Gaza residents whose homes were destroyed in the war.

On day 50, Israel has committed to withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor. It is unclear, therefore, why Hamas would want to release hostages after day 42.

Free my brother, bring Matan home'	Moshe Or, brother of hostage, travels the world, meeting officials and activists in France, England, and even Qatar to push for Avinatan’s release. 'This has become my real job now, he says. 'I’ll do whatever it takes.' Moshe Or remembers Oct. 7, 2023, with painful clarity. It was supposed to be a day of joy, Simchat Torah, a holiday celebrating faith and tradition. Instead, it became a day of horror for his family. As news of that day’s attacks in southern Israel trickled in, he had no idea that his brother, Avinatan Or, was at the Nova music festival, one of the first targets of the Hamas assault. The first sign that something was wrong came through social media. Friends were searching for Avinatan. Frantic, Moshe scoured Instagram and Telegram, joining Hamas-linked channels in a desperate bid for information. Hours later, his worst fears were confirmed—a video emerged showing his brother being taken hostage. 'I saw this video, and then I realized that Avinatan was kidnapped,' Moshe recalls. A Life Full of Promise Avinatan, now 32, is an electrical engineer, a graduate of Ben-Gurion University, and an employee at Nvidia. He is a family man, a devoted uncle, and a passionate cook who delights in preparing elaborate dishes. 'He never misses a family event,' Moshe says. 'No matter how far he has to travel, he is always there.' Avinatan and his girlfriend, Noa Argamani, had spent the night before the attack at her father’s home in Be’er Sheva before heading to the Nova festival. Both were kidnapped and taken to Gaza. While Noa was later rescued, Avinatan remains in captivity. 'The video of the kidnapping is also the last moment Noa saw Avinatan,' Moshe shares. 'When she was released, we came to her and we wanted to hear if she saw Avinatan. And she really wanted to hear if we had any information about him.' Since her release, Noa has become an outspoken advocate for the remaining hostages, tirelessly meeting world leaders in an effort to secure their freedom. A Family’s Struggle The Or family is large and deeply connected. With seven siblings, their home is always full—especially on Shabbat, with big meals and lively conversations. But since Oct. 7, 2023, their lives have been consumed by a different kind of gathering: a campaign to bring Avinatan home. Moshe has traveled extensively, meeting officials and activists in France, England, and even Qatar to push for his brother’s release. 'This has become my real job now,' he admits. 'I’ll do whatever it takes.' Their efforts have been met with frustration. The families of male hostages have been largely sidelined in the current negotiations, leaving them in a painful limbo. 'People talk about ‘Phase A’ and ‘Phase B’ of the hostage release deals, but it’s not true. There is no ‘Phase B.’ There is no plan in place for the young men still held captive,' Moshe says. 'They don’t talk about them. It really stresses us out.' Moshe also highlights a troubling reality: 'Nobody knows where the young men are. Nobody. We have no information. It’s as if they have disappeared. And that is the most terrifying part—there are no details, no updates, just silence.' A Message of Hope Despite the uncertainty, Moshe refuses to lose hope. 'Avinatan, if you can hear me, know that we are fighting for you. You will be released—it’s just a matter of time. Stay strong. Keep your head up. Imagine the moment you return home—what you’ll eat, who you’ll hug, the joy that awaits you. That day will come.' 'I want you to think about how your release day will look like,' Moshe continues, directing his words toward his brother. 'What will you wear on your release day? Who will you meet? What will you say to people? How will mom react when she sees you? What food do you want her to cook for you? What beer do you want to drink? What kind of meat do you want on the grill? Think about all these things, let them occupy your mind, and they will give you strength,' Moshe continues. As global negotiations continue, Moshe’s message to world leaders is clear: 'There is no price too high for their freedom. The Israeli government must do whatever it takes. We won’t stop fighting until every last hostage is home.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He also places hope in international intervention, particularly in the United States. 'We really hope that [US President] Trump will help us,' Moshe says. 'We hear his rhetoric. It’s very militant, and he wants the deal to be signed and all the hostages to return.' The Or family’s struggle is far from over, but they remain united in their determination. 'We are strong because we have to be,' Moshe says. 'For Avinatan, for all the families waiting for their loved ones—we won’t give up.'

Turkish police detained 282 suspected members of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, militant group in raids over the last five days, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on Tuesday. The raids came as Turkey continues to remove elected pro-Kurdish mayors from their posts over militant ties in a crackdown coinciding with hopes for an end to a 40-year conflict between the PKK and authorities. Jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is expected to make a statement on such efforts, four months after an ally of President Tayyip Erdogan urged him to call on the militants to lay down their arms. Police carried out this week's counter-terror raids in 51 provinces, as well as in the capital, Ankara, and the largest city of Istanbul, the minister said on X. The suspects were accused of conducting PKK propaganda, providing financing for the group, recruiting members and joining in street protests, he said. The police seized two AK 47 rifles among other weapons.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1gbas11qyx	2025-02-17T21:49:56-08:00	
IDF to withdraw from South Lebanon, keeping military presence in ...	Troops continued to destroy terror infrastructure along the border; military deployment along the frontier, three times larger than before the war; IDF says Hezbollah increasing efforts to launch drones for intelligence purposes The IDF will on Tuesday complete its withdrawal from Lebanon under the terms of the cease-fire agreement, leaving forces in five strategic locations, with the approval of the United States. As forces left South Lebanon villages, the Lebanese army was seen taking up positions. Forces continued their lastminute efforts to destroy remaining Hezbollah infrastructure in the morning hours after a car loaded with explosives was discovered on Thursday, likely to be used against the IDF during their ground offensive. The car was buried under the rubble of a building that was bombed earlier on in the fighting. The IDF does not anticipate an immediate Hezbollah response to the pullback because of the positions that the military would hold on to, to protect the Israeli communities on the border. But the military says provocations such as Hezbollah flag r aisings are to be expected and would be responded to if there is any danger to the troops. The IDF deployed a significant military presence to the border area, three times the size of the force that was there before the war. This is expected to provide some sense of security for residents returning to the north after nearly a year and a half away. 'We are determined to foil any effort to reconstruct infrastructure of bring in armaments that would allow Hezbollah to rebuild its military capabilities,' the IDF said.

Preparation s for next hostage releases including remains	Bodies of four to be delivered by Hamas to the Red Cross before tranfer to Israel for positive identification; Cabinet convenes to discuss cease-fire's second phase including an end to the war and return of all live hostages Israel is preparing for the next releases of hostages as the first phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal nears its completion. Six live hostages and eight bodies are expected to be returned. On Thursday, Israel will receive the bodies of four of the hostages who have not survived and on Saturday, at least three live hostages would be freed, although negotiations are continuing for the release of a total of six live hostages. If that is not accomplished, three more would be freed the following week. The remains of the hostages would be examined for DNA before they are returned. Hamas will deliver the remains to the Red Cross who will transfer them to the IDF. Official announcement would not be made before a positive identification is complete although Hamas is likely to release their identity earlier. When identification is completed, the bodies would be then prepared for burial either by the military rabbinate or the Religious Affairs Ministry. Among the remaining hostages included in the first phase of the deal are two civilians who crossed into Gaza on their own volition over a decade ago and have been held since by Hamas. They are Avera Mengiso and Hisham a Sayad. There are four hostages abducted in the Oct. 7 massacre who are either injured or ill: Omer Wenkert, Eliya Cohen, Omer Shem Tov and Tal Shoham.

Also named were Ohad Yahalomi, Oded Lifshitz and Tsahi Idan. Under the terms of the cease-fire deal, negotiations for the second phase were already to begin. Israel denied that they had been in process but on Monday the security cabinet met to discuss the next phase after U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff revealed that they had begun. Witkoff said in an interview with Fox News that the talks would continue for a week at a location to be determined. The second phase of the deal includes an end to the war and a complete withdrawal of troops in exchange for the return of all of the live hostages including the IDF soldiers being held by Hamas. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy8ft511qyg	2025-02-17T20:34:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/SylidNql9kg/SylidNql9kg_0_308_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

U.S. official: All hostages will leave Gaza under Trump	Exclusive: All of the hostages will be coming out of Gaza, as per U.S. President Donald Trump’s instruction ILTV News had a conversation on the sidelines of the events happening in Israel this week with a senior U.S. official who shared that, despite all the discussions about going back into Gaza and the Phase I and Phase II negotiations, all of the hostages will be coming out of Gaza, as per U.S. President Donald Trump’s instruction. The message received was clear: When Trump means business, he means business—this is non-negotiable. So, Israelis can feel confident that their loved ones will come home. Period. Over the weekend, Trump told reporters, 'If it was up to me, I would take a very hard stance, but I can't tell you what Israel is going to do.' However, before taking office, Trump vowed that every hostage would leave Gaza or 'hell would break loose.' When Hamas threatened to cancel the hostage deal, Trump issued an ultimatum that forced the organization back into compliance. Since November, when Israel secured the release of around 115 hostages as part of the first hostage-for-ceasefire deal, negotiations with Hamas have stalled. The remaining captives have now been in the terror group’s hands for more than 500 days. Currently, 73 hostages remain in Gaza, including some who are confirmed dead. Among them are American citizens. Israel is expected to receive four bodies on Thursday and three live hostages on Saturday. A report by The Jerusalem Post indicated that more than three hostages might be released on Saturday, citing an Israeli official.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkm2itzq1g	2025-02-17T19:13:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/S1Vs86bWqyg/S1Vs86bWqyg_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Israel is exhausted, traumatized, and still fighting'	Fleur Hassan-Nahoum describes situation in Israel as one of trauma, exhaustion, sadness, and disbelief The Israeli people are suffering from trauma and disbelief that, more than 500 days after the worst attack ever seen on Israeli sovereign territory, the hostages remain in captivity and the war against Hamas continues, according to Fleur Hassan-Nahoum, former deputy mayor of Jerusalem. 'There are still hostages that haven't returned home,' Hassan-Nahoum told ILTV. 'Hamas is still on its feet. It's almost unbelievable that we've destroyed, practically destroyed, Hezbollah, the Syrian government of [Bashar] Assad has toppled down, and yet here we still are trying to get our hostages home.' She described the situation in Israel as one of trauma, exhaustion, sadness, and disbelief.

How did American Jewish leaders react to Netanyahu?	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a powerful message on Sunday to the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a powerful message on Sunday to the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. He emphasized that Israel is stronger than ever and expressed full support for U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan for Gaza and the region. 'We see eye to eye with the US administration, with President Trump and his administration, first of all, on accomplishing the immediate three goals that we have in Gaza,' Netanyahu said. 'One is to achieve the release of all our hostages. The second, as I said, is to destroy Hamas. The third is to ensure that Gaza has a different future.' The prime minister added that 'President Trump has presented a bold new vision, and the only plan that I think can work to enable a different future for the people of Gaza, for the people of Israel, for the surrounding areas, why not give Gazans a choice?' Netanyahu highlighted Israel’s successes in Lebanon and Syria but acknowledged that more work remains in Gaza, likely referencing his earlier discussions with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, signaling that Israel may need to return to Gaza in the near future to fully eliminate Hamas, which still controls the territory. He also delivered strong remarks on Iran, calling it the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism. 'The greatest threat that Iran poses is that this decrepit regime would have achieved nuclear weapons, and we are committed, as President Trump has said many times, and as Secretary Rubio said today, we are committed that Iran never gets nuclear weapons,' Netanyahu said. The prime minister left the room energized and committed to working with Israel to turn this vision into reality. 'The prime minister coming here is an indication of his commitment to maintaining the dialog and making his voice heard and helping to explain the policies to the leadership of the American Jewish community,' said Malcom Honlein, former CEO of the Conference of Presidents. 'I believe we are on the cusp of major changes in the Middle East.' Former Trump antisemitism envoy Elan Carr said, 'I think the Prime Minister is 100% correct to say we stand with the United States and with President Trump in this bold new vision of the Middle East.' The five day conference brought around 65 delegates to Israel, fewer than in recent years, but including top leaders from North America's Jewish community. Along with site visits, delegates will meet with Genesis speaker Amir Ohana and other MKS to discuss key issues important to us Jews. 'What's weighing on the American Jewish community ... is number one, is making sure that the hostages can be brought home,' Deborah Lust Zaluda, chair of JNF-USA told ILTV. 'Also, how is the country going to come back from this? And what can we do to help that country come back from this?'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjxxltwqyg	2025-02-17T18:51:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/18/SJGvfYb9ye/SJGvfYb9ye_0_399_2048_1153_0_small.jpg
500 days of war: The cost, the silence and the fight ahead	Comment: Let’s not forget the Houthis, Islamic Jihadists in Iraq and Syria, and, of course, the head of the octopus—the Islamic Republic of Iran—which attacked Israel in the largest ballistic missile strike in history Monday marked 500 days of war. Five hundred days since our world was turned upside down. Let’s not forget how this war began. It began on October 7th, when Hamas broke the existing ceasefire, committing the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. 1,200 people—Israelis and nationals from countries around the world—were raped, tortured, and murdered. Hundreds were taken hostage into Gaza. Five hundred days later, 73 hostages remain in captivity, held in the darkest dungeons of Gaza. Without food. Without sunlight. Tortured. Injured. Their time is running out. Hamas orchestrated and perpetrated these acts, but it was not alone. Thousands of Palestinian civilians from Gaza also took part. And one day after October 7th, Israel was attacked again—this time from the north, by Hezbollah in Lebanon. And let’s not forget the Houthis, Islamic Jihadists in Iraq and Syria, and, of course, the head of the octopus—the Islamic Republic of Iran—which attacked Israel in the largest ballistic missile strike in history. And throughout this seven-front war—throughout Israel’s existential war—the world was silent. Silence from the United Nations. Silence from many Western leaders. Silence from human rights groups. Silence from women’s rights groups. Just silence. And worse than silence—condemnations. Condemnations from the UN. From kangaroo courts. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets—not to call for the release of the hostages. Not to demand that Hamas and Hezbollah surrender. No. But to accuse Israel of genocide. To call on Israel to stop defending itself. To lose this war. And with these calls—and the weak leadership displayed by world leaders—came the rise of antisemitism. The age-old phenomenon in a new form. And Jews are once again being targeted around the world—simply for being Jews. But despite all of this. Despite everything. In these 500 days of war, the IDF and Israel’s security forces launched incredible operations—who can forget the Be’eri attack? But these came at a heavy price. Over 800 soldiers—brothers, sons, husbands, fathers—killed in combat. We don’t forget their heroic sacrifices. For the most part, Israel has stood alone. It has had some help from allies—but not enough. And 500 days later, we continue to see the strength of the people of Israel. We see their resilience. Israel is beginning to rebuild. To rehabilitate. A change in leadership has finally brought the moral clarity that was so sorely lacking since October 7th. Our allies—especially the United States, led by President Donald Trump—are standing alongside Israel unequivocally and demanding change. Not from Israel, but from Hamas and its allies. Demanding an end to the status quo that brought us to this day. Five hundreds days in, we are in the midst of a ceasefire. The Axis of Resistance is severely weakened. But the war is far from over. It will not end—we will not be able to move on—until Israel sees the return of all the hostages and Hamas is eliminated once and for all. But 500 days later there is finally optimism. And there is hope.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkbctdz9kx	2025-02-17T18:33:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/06/ByCXmFe4Jl/ByCXmFe4Jl_0_166_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
He tried to finish us off,' say Israeli tourists attacked by Jew...	Ari and Yarin Rabey, a father and son on vacation in the US, narrowly escaped a shooting by a Jewish gunman who mistook them for Palestinians; 'He came toward us and fired 17 bullets—it felt like an eternity,' says Ari, 20, who was shot in the shoulder An Israeli father and son on vacation in Miami Beach narrowly escaped death when a gunman opened fire on their car, firing 17 bullets in what they initially believed was an antisemitic attack. Yarin and Ari Rabey, from Ra’anana, were driving through an upscale neighborhood on Saturday night when Mordechai Brafman, a 27-year-old Jewish man, overtook their vehicle, exited his truck, and began shooting. Ari, 20, was struck in the shoulder. Speaking from his hospital bed, he recounted the terrifying moments. 'The shooting lasted about a minute and a half. He came toward us and fired 17 bullets—it felt like an eternity,' he said. 'Two bullets grazed my father’s face. He tried to finish us off, approaching the car doors.' Brafman was arrested shortly after the shooting and told police: 'I killed two Palestinians.' Ari described the moments leading up to the attack, explaining that he and his father had stopped briefly to admire a mansion. 'We looked at it and said, ‘Wow, how gorgeous,’ and were there for about a minute. Suddenly, a massive truck appeared, overtook us, made a U-turn, and stopped in front of us,' he said. Sensing danger, Ari urged his father to drive forward. 'As we approached the truck, the driver opened the door and started shooting at us with an automatic weapon,' he said. The two managed to flee while under fire. 'When he started shooting at us, we jumped around inside the car. My father kept control of the wheel, driving onto sidewalks so the shooter wouldn’t be able to hit us. We hit speed bumps at 93 mph,' Ari recalled. Yarin, the father, described how he managed to accelerate away while lying low in the car. 'The smell of gunpowder filled the car. He chased us and fired two more bullets, which passed right by my head and, miraculously, didn’t hit me,' he said. After escaping, they sought help at a nearby hotel, but the staff refused to let them in upon seeing their bullet-riddled car. 'We ran down the street to another building, where a security guard armed with a weapon came out and protected us. Soon after, police and ambulances arrived and evacuated us to the hospital,' Ari said.

Hours later, the FBI informed them that Brafman had been looking for Arabs and mistook them for Palestinians. 'They brought us into a room and were very kind,' Ari said. 'They explained that the shooter thought we were dead when he was arrested. He told the police, ‘I killed two Palestinians.’' Despite surviving, both father and son remain deeply shaken. 'I’m not okay; I’m terrified,' Ari said. 'A Jew almost killed me. No one should harm anyone, and no one has the right to take another person’s life—whether they’re Arab or Jewish. Someone tried to murder us, and we were given our lives back as a gift.' Yarin emphasized how close they came to being killed. 'This was an attack in every sense, even if it was a case of mistaken identity,' he said. 'It lasted a minute and a half—he was firing nonstop, and the smell of gunpowder filled the car. The fact that we survived 17 bullets from an automatic weapon is a miracle.' The two showed remarkable presence of mind during the attack. After fleeing, they abandoned the car and ran for help. 'During the attack, we ran toward a building we saw, but the security guard didn’t want to let us in because we were covered in blood and he was scared,' Yarin said. 'We ran to another building, where a security guard armed with a weapon came out and helped us get assistance.' He described the overwhelming trauma of the incident. 'We were absolutely terrified. I’m not in good mental shape and am traumatized by what we went through,' Yarin said. Ari echoed that sentiment. 'All the police officers said it’s unbelievable that we survived,' he said. 'The shooter fired 17 bullets at our car, and only one hit. It’s truly a miracle.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkktx411cyl	2025-02-17T15:37:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/17/Skx9O1xW9Je/Skx9O1xW9Je_0_433_480_271_0_small.jpg
