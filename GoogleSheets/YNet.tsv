IDF targets Hezbollah chief of operations in Beirut strike, repor...	Muhammad Haydar, a former member of parliament, described as the strategic and security brain of Hezbollah's operations and its military chief, after the assassination of many of the terror-group's senior commanders The IDF strike on Beirut early on Saturday targeted Muhammad Haydar, Hezbollah's chief of operations, Sky News Arabic reported citing Israeli officials. Haydar, a former member of parliament, was a close advisor to slain leader Hassan Nasrallah, assassinated in an attack on the Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut in September. The IDF considered him chief of the terror group's military after a string of assassinations of top Hezbollah commanders. He has been leading the organization in recent months and sources tod the Saudi Arabia Al Hadath channel that he was the strategic – security brain behind Hezbollah's war with Israel. According to reports in Lebanon, the military used bunker busting bombs in the strike that brought down an 8-storey building and created a crater. At least 11 people were killed and more wounded but Lebanese health officials said they expected the death toll to rise because teams were struggling to pull survivors from the rubble. The strike came without warning, as was the practice of the IDF, in the pre-dawn hours, while at the same time, Hezbollah fired 5 rockets at Haifa and its surrounding areas. Later the military warned residents of the Dahieh to leave ahead of an Israeli strike.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s12qag17yg	2024-11-23T00:32:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/23/BJ8bff17yg/BJ8bff17yg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

It’s not rockets destroying Israel—it's this	ILTV's Insider: Is Israel, as some have said, a nation in trauma? Since 6:29 a.m. on October 7, 2023, Israelis have found themselves on a relentless journey of trauma. Each day since that fateful morning has been punctuated by sirens, artillery fire, and the ever-present echoes of grief and fear. The massacre at the Nova Music Festival and the atrocities across towns and villages in Israel’s south left scars that extend far beyond the physical, searing into the national psyche. The horror of those events—and the propaganda that followed—was not just an assault on Israel but an attack on the very fabric of humanity. On Insider, ILTV News and guests confront the unspoken aftermath: The enduring psychological toll on individuals and a society grappling with loss, fear, and uncertainty. Is Israel, as some have said, a nation in trauma? How do survivors begin to heal? And what would it take to construct a 'mental health Iron Dome' to protect our collective well-being? To help answer these questions, ILTV interviews four guests: Prof. Mark Weiser, director of the Psychiatric Rehabilitation Center at Sheba Medical Center Manny Waks, host of the podcast PTSD Nation and a passionate mental health advocate Tomer Zadik and Yoav Haver, Nova Festival survivors Watch Insider: View previous episodes >>	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjzsrwymjx	2024-11-22T22:42:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/06/rJl4IuAprT/rJl4IuAprT_2_0_1919_1080_0_small.jpg

Bella Hadid cried when I told her about October 7'	Israeli designer Brit Shaked shares insights from behind-the-scenes interactions with Bella and Gigi Hadid, despite their anti-Israel stance; reveals challenges of haute couture, navigating competitive fashion world Israeli designer Brit Shaked is celebrating eight years since graduating from Shenkar College of Engineering, Design and Art and moving to New York. She lives in the Big Apple with her partner Ofer and their daughter Rena, who attends a Chabad daycare. 'Ofer and I grew up just 10 minutes apart in Israel, and we have mutual friends back home, but we somehow had to come here to meet,' says Shaked, 32, who recently fulfilled a dream by leading the design and couture production for Victoria’s Secret’s highly anticipated fashion show in New York, the brand's first in six years. Behind the scenes, among angel wings and international supermodels like Gigi and Bella Hadid, Shaked says she remained true to her Israeli roots. 'There was a lot of criticism online about me working with the Hadid sisters, but I didn’t have a say in the matter,' Shaked explains. 'I was chosen to manage this massive project, and they were part of the team of top models, alongside even bigger names like Carla Bruni, Kate Moss, Cher, Adriana Lima, and Tyra Banks. I didn’t treat Bella and Gigi any differently than the others. Instead of avoiding dialogue, as many expected, I saw working with them as an opportunity to speak from a position of strength about the events of October 7.' What do you mean by ‘a position of strength’? 'The fashion world may seem glamorous from the outside, but at the end of the day, everyone is human, with insecurities and fears. All the models care deeply about how they look and are terrified of tripping on the runway during the live show. They crave emotional support and reassurance, just like anyone else. Meeting them for the first time is exciting, but once I start working, I’m the one who ensures they feel comfortable so they can perform their best.' How do you manage to make the Hadid sisters feel at ease while dealing with such conflicting emotions? She laughs. 'I’m an Israeli with an Israeli accent, I served in the army, and I don’t hide who I am. But I separate my work from my personal beliefs. It’s incredibly difficult to detach from our feelings as Israelis, especially since October 7, but when you strip away the public image, the models are surprisingly human. One of them is a mother, and so am I.' What kind of criticism did you face online for working with them? 'The comments were harsh: ‘How dare you. You have blood on your hands.’ But I succeeded in sitting with them one-on-one. I told them I was in Israel on October 7 for a family wedding that was canceled due to the war, and I stayed there for a while with my baby during an extremely traumatic and frightening time. I shared the loss and grief we’ve all felt, how everyone in Israel knows someone who has been impacted. Though the conversation was brief, I felt empowered to expose them to our suffering. Bella even cried when I told her my story.' She cried? She should delete her Instagram. 'I brought that up, too. It was my chance to say, ‘What you’re doing on social media is hurting so many people.’ If I had refused to work with her, I wouldn’t have had the opportunity to say it. And I wouldn’t have achieved anything by being confrontational. When I came to their fittings, I had a lot of animosity toward them, and I was even disappointed that they were polite and human toward me. I don’t know if it was genuine, but they’re professionals. You don’t reach their level without being highly professional.' Shaked also held her ground with other celebrities known for their lack of support for Israel, such as Iman and Paloma Elsesser. 'Again, my strength came from the fact that they were models before a critical show and needed my help in their most stressful moments. Right before the show, they came to me in tears from the pressure, and I was able to have a profound impact on them. Despite what they think, I was there as an Israeli and a Jew, and they needed me. That’s why I think the criticism of ‘You shouldn’t have worked with them’ is misguided. The victory is being present, not disappearing. We have more influence from within, not from the outside.' What about the Hadid sisters’ prominence on social media? 'In Israel, people blow their influence out of proportion. Yes, they have a significant following, but in the show I managed, they were just two of many models, including the wonderful Israeli model Sun Mizrahi. The Hadid sisters weren’t special in any way—one opened the show, and the other closed it.' What’s your view on haute couture in Israel? 'Unfortunately, many people in the Israeli fashion industry work for free. It’s hard for me to even mention the sums I earn in New York. There’s no couture in Israel; there aren’t the budgets to execute grand projects, and there’s little value placed on art. When I create a moving garment, I get responses like, ‘Why do I need this?’ or ‘I can’t wear that.’ People in Israel understand the concept of art on a wall, but they don’t grasp paying $10,000 for a dress that’s a work of art.' Do you understand the concept? 'Yes, because I know what it takes and what it offers. Cities like Paris, Milan, and New York have industries built around this, generating millions. There are people who seek unique pieces, and they sell. But let’s face it, succeeding financially in haute couture is challenging. Many celebrities expect designers to work for free, saying, ‘I’m a celeb; design for me, and I’ll tag you online.’ Early in your career, it’s a fair trade—I did plenty of free work for credit because you need the experience and exposure.' Why not shift to commercial fashion entirely? 'I tried, and it made me very unhappy. When you’re a creative designer and have to compromise your art, it’s stifling. For two years, I worked in commercial fashion, and I realized I didn’t aspire to the roles above me. It was demoralizing. On the other hand, I need to make a living. Living in New York with two kids is expensive. So at first, I took unpaid projects for the sake of my creativity while doing other jobs to make ends meet. Now, I constantly look for projects to reinvent myself without compromising too much, which is tough. It’s hard to sit in a room and say, ‘This is my price. I’m worth it,’ knowing some might say I’m delusional.' What advice would you give aspiring Israeli designers? 'There’s still an issue in Israel. The industry relies on Shenkar graduates who are eager to succeed and offers unpaid opportunities, saying, ‘Your design will make it into Vogue.’ I understand that—early in your career, you have to support yourself with other jobs and build experience because this field is experience-driven. But once you’ve gained experience, you must stand your ground and demand fair compensation for your talent and hard work.' Born in New York while her parents studied there, Shaked returned to Israel at age three. Her parents, both in tech, always supported her passion for fashion, which began early. She recently shared on Instagram, 'The 10-year-old me is screaming inside. I can’t believe this is real. When I was offered the role of designing the couture pieces and wings for the Victoria’s Secret show, I thought it was a joke. Today, after zero hours of sleep, a broken back, and severe separation anxiety from my daughter Rena, I’m living a dream I never dared to dream because it felt too big. This massive production, on a scale I couldn’t imagine, gave me a sense of fulfillment and relief that it’s over, and I can return to my life. Even after thinking I couldn’t do it as a mom and pregnant, I proved it’s possible. From cutting fruit for daycare to fitting Tyra Banks, Cher, and Adriana Lima—it’s all doable. And in these dark days, being Israeli and Jewish in such an influential role is my greatest victory.' How did you handle managing a multimillion-dollar budget while pregnant? 'It’s tough, but I worked hard to leave personal matters at home. No one in this industry wants to deal with your personal or medical issues. I learned the rules quickly. For example, there’s no maternity leave here unless you work for a very structured company. Most of my colleagues don’t have or want kids. In fashion, children aren’t the norm, so I manage motherhood quietly, relying on support from loved ones like my husband, who works as a carpenter in his family’s business. Doing all this with a toddler and being pregnant was challenging, but not everyone gets such an opportunity, which is also a financial lifeline.' Shaked prefers to stay behind the scenes and has never felt the need to gain fame as a fashion designer. As she puts it, 'I never cared about having my name on the door—I’m a team player.' This philosophy guides her as she takes the first steps with 'Foryou' a diaper bag brand she founded alongside her good friend Noam Ravid, a fellow Shenkar graduate who also lives in New York. The brand's products are still under development. 'High fashion offers little stability,' she explains. 'You can have one hugely successful project and then go a year without work. That’s why I decided to launch a commercial brand—for financial stability and my kids’ future.' The brand will be infused with humor, something Shaked sees as a way to lighten the challenges of parenthood. 'It’s a reflection of everything I am—an entrepreneur, a mother, and a fashion designer. And finally, I’m the customer myself. Plus, I’ve found the best partner, who’s also a close friend. We’re building this together.' She describes the venture as her 'baby' and 'pension plan,' providing the security her family needs while allowing her to continue pursuing the extraordinary art she loves in the world of high fashion.

IDF strikes Beirut, 8 story building brought down	There was no warning from the IDF before the attack in the early morning hours as was customary; Hezbollah-affiliated media says the building struck by missiles and some nearby were full of people An eight story building was bombed by the IDF early on Saturday killing at least four people and wounding 23 others, according to Lebanese media reports. There was no warning from the IDF Arabic Language spokesperson, ahead of the attack on the Basta neighborhood, as had been the practice before strikes on the Dahieh district in the city or in South Lebanon. The blasts shook the capital around 4 a.m. (0200 GMT), Reuters witnesses said. Security sources said at least four bombs were dropped in the attack. It marked the fourth Israeli airstrike this week targeting a central area of Beirut, where the bulk of Israel's attacks have targeted the Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs. On Sunday an Israeli airstrike killed a Hezbollah media official in the Ras al-Nabaa district of central Beirut. The Hezbollah-affiliated Al Mayadeen network reported that the number of casualties was expected to rise because the building and others nearby were 'teaming with people,' and emergency teams were struggling to pull victims from the rubble.

My brush with justice: Serving on a New York jury	The jury summons in the mail felt like something out of a Law & Order episode, but reality proved exhausting and mundane; Daniel Edelson joined dozens of impatient candidates called to a courthouse in Lower Manhattan to participate in the US jury system; here's how it unfolded—right up to the anticlimactic ending For those raised on a steady diet of Judge Judy and reruns of Law & Order, few things are more unsettling than a letter in the mail that reads: 'You are summoned.' This meant I had been called to fulfill my civic duty as a juror. My mind raced with dramatic visions of jury room debates where I’d passionately argue, like Olivia Pope, to convince everyone that O.J. was guilty. Reality would hit me soon enough, but in the meantime, nothing was stopping me from Googling court dates for P. Diddy or scouring for new lawsuits against Donald Trump that might coincide with my summons. Who knows? Maybe I’d land on a high-profile case. The envelope in the mail couldn’t have been more conspicuous. Americans have always had a flair for the dramatic with bells and whistles. 'You Have Been Summoned for Jury Service,' the bold text declared. The date fell on the eve of a holiday, and for a brief moment, I considered invoking my Judaism to get out of it. But I knew it would only delay the inevitable. New York law allows you to postpone jury duty only once. Missing the rescheduled date would label me a 'non-compliant juror,' subject to a hefty fine or even arrest for contempt of court. And so, on a dark October morning, I found myself dragging out of bed before sunrise, stepping into the 48-degree chill, and navigating endless lines—from the subway entrance to the courthouse doors in Chinatown. Behind me stood a frazzled mom, who, in a distinctly un-New York, non-progressive Southern drawl, threatened to smack her crying baby if he didn’t stop. As would become a recurring theme, he probably didn’t want to be there any more than I did. Inside the courthouse, the same story continued: another line for the elevator, a never-ending line to the 11th floor, and yet another line outside the room where I was supposed to serve as a juror. The room was packed with dozens of people, most of whom looked tired, annoyed and not entirely sure why they were there. I joined the line without question—a distinctly American habit. After about 15 minutes, someone finally voiced the absurd question: 'Is this the line for jury duty?' It turned out I’d been standing in the wrong line entirely—this one was for exemptions, where people were trying to get out of serving. I’d thought people would jump at the chance to judge others. After all, we do it recreationally all the time—so why not earn $40 a day for it? But apparently, the idea doesn’t appeal to most. In a way, it was a relief to discover that beneath the saccharine American veneer lies a more honest truth: an individualistic, solidarity-free society doesn’t suddenly change its stripes over a fancy envelope in the mail. When presidential candidates openly call to dismantle already-weak public health care systems and deport the vulnerable and the foreign-born, is it any wonder that when told, 'Hey, without your presence, justice won’t be served,' they’re not exactly rushing to comply? Many Americans go to great lengths to avoid jury duty, sometimes in particularly creative ways. Some show up in expensive suits to appear 'too important' for the role, while others wear rags to convey the opposite impression. If they hear it’s a traffic case, they might suddenly declare, 'When I was five, my dad jaywalked, so I’m unfit to judge a case like this—sorry.' Those who remain face a barrage of manipulation from attorneys, who often assume the jurors lack knowledge and try to confuse them with complex calculations for medical damages. Jurors might whisper to one another, 'Oh, poor guy, maybe we should cut him some slack.' But typically, the judge steps in to steer the jury toward more reasonable conclusions, dropping heavy hints like, 'This person broke the law and should be punished accordingly.' For those unfamiliar with the system, it can seem odd. Would you trust your fate to the random person sitting next to you on the bus? Yet, Americans are deeply attached to their jury system (when they’re not required to participate). When told that in many countries a single judge decides cases, they tend to shift uncomfortably in their seats. What? Just one judge decides? Isn’t that strange? asdv The concept of a jury is admittedly quite noble. Its origins trace back to the Magna Carta—a 13th-century charter of rights that England’s King John was forced to sign, promising fair trials and ensuring that judges would not simply serve the interests of the ruling class. The United States, founded as a nation of immigrants seeking to escape Britain’s class system, naturally embraced this egalitarian principle. Juries are a cornerstone of the American justice system and are constitutionally mandated. Some might argue the process is merely theater, with judges ultimately steering decisions, but by law, juries hold the ultimate authority and can override a judge if they choose. The Constitution guarantees a fair and swift trial before a group of 'ordinary' citizens tasked with determining guilt or innocence. In criminal cases, jurors decide whether the prosecution has proven the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. For serious cases, such as those involving the death penalty, the jury also determines the sentence. In civil trials, jurors decide whether the defendant should compensate the plaintiff and, if so, how much. In states like New York, before criminal charges are filed, a 'grand jury' convenes to decide whether there is enough evidence to proceed to trial. Those following Trump’s legal entanglements may recall that if sufficient evidence is found, the case moves to a 'petit jury,' which determines guilt or innocence. In some cases, a separate jury may be assembled to decide the sentence. This layered process means one thing: the system needs a lot of jurors. Nearly every U.S. citizen over the age of 18 can be summoned for jury duty, entering a selection pool known as the 'jury pool.' To qualify, candidates must meet basic criteria, including citizenship, proficiency in English, good health and a clean criminal record. Selection happens through a process called 'voir dire,' where prospective jurors are questioned about their background and potential biases. Those chosen may spend days, weeks or even months serving, particularly in states where juries must reach unanimous decisions. For each day of jury service, participants are entitled to $40, paid either by the state or their employer. Interestingly, the British chose not to implement the jury system in what was then Mandatory Palestine. Fearing that local residents might acquit individuals charged with rebellion against the mandate, the British avoided introducing this extensive system. Today, it’s hard not to be struck by the enormous resources the U.S. dedicates to selecting jurors—a bureaucratic process turned into a large-scale operation. True to form, America does everything on a grand scale, even something as seemingly mundane as jury selection. asdfdxc A diverse crowd fills the spacious waiting room. Like New York City itself, the room is a microcosm of the world: old folk, blue-haired hipsters, suits and, above all, exhausted people nodding off in their chairs. Unlike other jurisdictions that rely solely on voter rolls, New York pulls potential jurors from a variety of databases—tax authorities, informal education records and more—aiming to reach as many people as possible and assemble the most diverse jury pool. Studies show that diverse juries have a significant advantage. Groups composed of individuals from varied backgrounds tend to examine evidence more thoroughly and engage in deeper discussions before reaching decisions. By contrast, homogeneous juries can lead to less fair verdicts, particularly in cases involving defendants from minority groups. All-white juries are statistically more likely to convict Black defendants at higher rates. I know this because it was explained to us by a law professor in a video shown to all jury candidates (more on that later). But despite the room’s visible diversity, everyone shares one common trait: no one wants to be there. I overheard one man solemnly argue to the clerk that being in a relationship made him unfit to serve. Another managed to dodge service by claiming he didn’t understand English—delivered in Spanish with a thick Yankee accent. Those of us who stayed filled out forms about ourselves and waited. And then we waited some more. 'Thank you for your service,' said the polite clerk, patiently repeating instructions for late arrivals with admirable composure. She played a video featuring the chief judge, who enthusiastically extolled the privilege of serving as a juror and ensuring justice for all. 'No one can escape this duty—not even me,' he concluded. Next came the professor’s video, with all the flair of a Hollywood production. It delved into biases and stereotypes. On-screen, dashed triangles formed a Star of David, triggering an odd sense of paranoia. The professor asked, 'How many triangles are in this image?' Answers ranged from 13 to one, but the correct answer was zero—none of the triangles were complete. The point was clear: we tend to fill in gaps and supply information that may not exist. She urged us to challenge assumptions and stereotypes ingrained by media. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Don’t let biases mislead you or discriminate based on religion, race or gender,' she said. 'The system relies on you to deliver justice without prejudice. Thank you for your service!' I left with a few good insights from these videos—ones that lasted about a day. The waiting continued until an unexpected reprieve: a lunch break. There’s no cafeteria in the courthouse, but being in the heart of Chinatown means dim sum beckons from every storefront. The $40 earned from this otherwise pointless day of waiting could easily be splurged. By 2:15 p.m., it was back to the jury room, where I claimed a desk with a charging port. The Wi-Fi was excellent, probably the highlight of the day. The supervisor asked us to maintain a 'library atmosphere,' which seemed fitting given the symphony of snoring around me. I settled into a few surprisingly productive hours of work. assfas Serving on a jury in New York was once a dubious experience, with dirty rooms, grumpy clerks more focused on cleaning floors and talk shows blaring on televisions. But in 1994, Chief Judge Judith Kaye, the state’s highest-ranking judicial official, decided enough was enough. 'We cannot ask jurors to fulfill their civic responsibility in a dilapidated environment while relying on outdated procedures,' she declared. Kaye shortened the duration of jury duty, renovated courthouses, emphasized better treatment of jurors by staff and introduced stricter oversight of the racial and ethnic composition of potential juries. In the past, attorneys could easily dismiss potential jurors based on gender, religion or other characteristics. As recently as May, widespread coverage emerged about a review of more than 35 death penalty convictions in California courts after revelations that prosecutors had manipulated jury selection. These prosecutors ensured Jewish jurors were excluded, citing surveys showing that, compared to other religious groups, Jews were less supportive of capital punishment. Jewish communities are among the most vocal opponents of execution by gas due to the Holocaust’s memory. Judges in the state admitted that excluding Jewish jurors from death penalty cases was a common practice. My grandfather, himself a Holocaust survivor, used to recount how he was disqualified from jury service in New York, even for minor cases, out of concern that the trauma of Auschwitz would make him biased. Even today, attorneys can exclude a certain number of individuals from jury duty if they believe, for any reason, that those individuals cannot be impartial. In a murder trial involving a shooting, for example, attorneys might ask potential jurors if they’ve lost a loved one under similar circumstances (think John Grisham’s The Runaway Jury, later adapted into a film starring Dustin Hoffman, John Cusack and Gene Hackman). In medical malpractice cases, they might ask if anyone has a doctor in their family, and so on. In my case, I didn’t even get the chance to be screened or excluded. At 5 p.m., the clerk cleared her throat and announced that all of us, without exception, were dismissed. The room burst to life, with cheers echoing from every corner. No one understood why we’d wasted an entire day waiting only to be sent home, but no one bothered to ask.

Minister Katz setting stage for settler assault on Palestinians, ...	Following Israel Katz's decision to cease using administrative detention orders against Jews in the West Bank, Palestinian Authority officials are saying this will lead to increased assaults by wayward settlers on Palestinian civilians; 'Then they will complain about The Hague,' says MK Tibi The Palestinian Authority is worried that Defense Minister Israel Katz's decision to cease using administrative detention orders against Jews in the West Bank might legitimize Jewish terror activities in the region, potentially leading to further escalation. Hours after Katz's announcement, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry stated that this decision 'will encourage settlers to commit additional crimes.' 'We view Defense Minister Katz's decision to cancel administrative detention against settlers committing crimes and violations against Palestinian civilians with great concern,' the statement read. The Palestinians also pointed out that 'the number of detainees is very small.' The Palestinian Authority warned that this decision by Katz, who recently assumed office replacing Yoav Gallant, 'encourages extreme settlers to engage in terrorism against Palestinians, their land, and property, giving them a sense of immunity and additional protection.' The Palestinian Foreign Ministry also called for 'effective international action' to curb what they described as 'settler militia terror.' According to the ministry, 'an end must be put to the fact that they receive 'immunity from punishment' and to protect our people from the occupation.' Qadura Fares, head of the Prisoners' Affairs Authority and former prisoners, also commented on Katz’s decision, stating that 'at a time when Israeli authorities are waging the most despicable war against the Palestinian people, with random arrests daily, and perpetuating collective punishment through an unprecedented expansion of administrative detention policy, about 3,500 Palestinians are detained today while the administrative detentions of the Jewish rioters are canceled.' He claimed this move reflects a 'racist and fascist state,' which he argues 'is based on hatred and organized crime, and in its extreme policy, threatens human and social values.' Legal officials issued a warning At noon, senior legal officials addressed the Defense Minister's decision, stating that 'the decision grants a 'license to kill' to 'Na'arei Gva'ot' (hilltop youth) and ties the hands of the Shin Bet in dealing with subversive Jewish elements in the territories.' They added that 'the decision could spur underground activities targeting Arabs and could ignite the area.' Senior officials clarified that 'the decision will also significantly harm the Shin Bet's ability to thwart and deter both extreme Jews and Arabs.' The legal system believes that if petitions are filed to the High Court of Justice, it will overturn Katz’s decision due to its discriminatory enforcement of law on racial grounds. Shin Bet declined to comment on the decision. This week, Defense Minister Katz informed Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar of the dramatic move and requested alternative tools be put in place. However, Katz did not cancel dozens of existing administrative detention orders, but he will not renew them when they expire in a few weeks. 'In a reality where settlements in the West Bank face severe Palestinian terror threats and unjustified international sanctions against settlers, it is not appropriate for the State of Israel to take such severe measures against the settlers,' stated the Defense Minister. Earlier, Knesset member Ahmad Tibi responded to the decision, saying, 'This is essentially the Defense Minister's certification for Jewish terrorism. Then they will complain about The Hague. A government of terror supporters.' The 'Tag Meir' organization, which fights hate crimes, stated: 'Administrative detention orders are aimed against Jewish terrorism and acts of revenge against innocent Palestinians. Ceasing the use of administrative detention orders will permit the bloodshed and property damage of these Palestinians, with the approval of the Defense Minister. Minister Katz ignores the diplomatic and security damage that will be caused to Israel due to this decision.' The 'Yesh Din' organization said: 'Administrative detentions are a draconian and anti-democratic measure that should cease to be used against both Palestinians and Israelis. Instead, law enforcement authorities should conduct effective investigations and prosecute when there is sufficient evidence. Let us remember that thousands of Palestinians are held in administrative detention under orders that Minister Katz did not cancel.'

Israel ponders giving aid distribution management in Gaza to US p...	Netanyahu wishes to have a private US security firm manage the issue of distributing humanitarian aid within Gaza, but runs into legal challenges regarding the scope of the operation, and the issue of footing the bill has not yet been solved, given it could implicate Israel in case it turns violent on the ground Amid the Israeli government's plan to delegate the responsibility of distributing humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip to an external company, two main issues are delaying the activation of the American security firm 'Orbis,' which is slated for this role. Legal challenges arise from the company's operational scope in Gaza and the financial source for covering its services. The anticipated cost for securing aid convoys is projected to be around $60 million, independent of the aid distribution itself, which is estimated at approximately $200 million. Additionally, establishing the company's distribution operations in Gaza is expected to take about three months—a problematic duration as most convoys currently entering the Strip are being plundered. Orbis is backed by former U.S. Army generals and is affiliated with an American parent company, essentially a conglomerate of six firms. It remains uncertain whether the U.S. will agree to finance the operation, given the financier assumes responsibility for aid distribution. Concerns were voiced in discussions about a scenario where Israel might be accused of a massacre if security personnel were compelled to open fire. Concurrently, it has been revealed that Israel has paid an advance to the American company to develop plans for a pilot project concerning aid distribution in Jabaliya, located in the northern Gaza Strip. The cabinet is expected to receive an update on the plan on Saturday, but it will not seek approval since a resolution has yet to be found for the challenges of assigning aid distribution to the external company Earlier, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant sharply criticized the government's intention to discuss 'food distribution to Gaza residents by private companies under IDF security,' labeling it a 'euphemism for the inception of military governance in Gaza.' Gallant argued that 'the price will be paid by the soldiers' blood and the State of Israel due to a flawed prioritization that will lead to the neglect of more critical security tasks. Everything hinges on the prior preparation of an alternative entity to replace the IDF in holding the territory—without this, we are on the path to martial law,' he stated. 'The aid will be distributed by private companies, the companies will be guarded by the IDF, and we will all bear the cost.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich responded to Gallant's remarks. 'for an entire year, he imagined a 'non-existent alternative' to do the work for us, effectively preventing us from taking responsibility for the distribution of humanitarian aid.' Smotrich claimed that 'since this non-existent entity did not materialize, Gallant allowed Hamas to seize control of humanitarian aid and maintain its rule in the Strip, thereby prolonging the conflict, increasing its cost, and exacerbating the suffering of hostages and their families. It is not the management of humanitarian aid that will lead to casualties, nor a military administration if required, but rather the fear of achieving total victory and territorial control that is essential for security.' National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir fiercely criticized Gallant as well. 'Tonight it was proven again how wise it was for the Prime Minister to dismiss the failed Defense Minister Gallant—as is well known, my position is clear that humanitarian aid should be exchanged only for humanitarian aid, but in any case—as long as aid continues—IDF control over the humanitarian aid to Gaza residents is crucial to dismantle Hamas and strip it of its remaining control of Gaza, which is the goal of the war. Gallant, who is deeply entrenched in the old paradigm and supported by the opposition, would be better off remaining there.' Adversely, former War Cabinet member Benny Gantz backed Gallant's statements, asserting that 'Israeli security control in Gaza is essential. Israeli governance when our soldiers are dealing with sewage and garbage is disastrous.'

Elise Stefanik assumes her position The United Nations faces serious challenges, according to Prof. Gerald Steinberg of NGO Monitor. In an interview with ILTV on Thursday, Steinberg predicted significant changes in the UN's approach once newly nominated U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Elise Stefanik, assumes her position under the Trump administration. 'The Trump administration could cut off a lot of funding for these activities, which I think will force a sobering up at the UN,' Steinberg said. 'I also believe that in other countries, there’s growing momentum to reevaluate their automatic support for international processes that are proving ineffective.' Steinberg also suggested that several Western European countries might recognize that current UN practices undermine their goals and interests, prompting them to advocate for change. His remarks followed the U.S. veto of a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The U.S. justified its veto, stating the resolution failed to include provisions for the immediate return of 101 Israeli hostages held by Hamas.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry0xxj0zye	2024-11-22T01:58:58-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2021/02/08/ByVVvvRxd/ByVVvvRxd_0_0_1020_574_0_small.jpg

Defense minister asks Shin Bet chief to plan an implement alternative measures to deal with settler violence in region; Smotrich and Ben-Gvir laud decision Defense Minister Israel Katz announced on Friday he decided to suspend the use of administrative detention orders against Jewish settlers in the West Bank. Katz informed Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar of the move earlier this week and requested the planning and implementation of alternative measures. 'In a reality where Jewish settlements in the West Bank face severe Palestinian terror threats and unjust international sanctions against settlers, it's inappropriate for the State of Israel to employ such severe measures against members of the settlement community,' Katz said, explaining his shift in policy. 'If suspicion of criminal acts arises, the perpetrators can be prosecuted. If not, there are other preventive measures that can be taken without resorting to administrative detention. I condemn any violence against Palestinians or acts of vigilante justice and call on settlement leadership to take a similar public stance and unequivocally denounce such actions,' he added.' 'It's essential to allow the IDF, other security agencies and law enforcement authorities to address Palestinian terror and violence without individuals taking the law into their own hands.' National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir praised the decision, saying, 'I commend my colleague, Minister Israel Katz, for this significant and important announcement. His decision to stop issuing administrative orders against settlers in the West Bank corrects years of injustice and honors those who love this land.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also lauded the decision: 'With this decision, Minister Katz has ended years of discrimination against West Bank settlers and rectified a long-standing injustice.' 'Settlers were treated as second-class citizens, subjected to draconian and undemocratic measures that trampled their rights — measures not applied to any other population in Israel except dangerous enemies and terrorists,' he added.

Biden slams ICC warrants as 'outrageous'	U.S. president criticizes UN court and asserts that there should be no equivalence between Israel and Hamas; Pentagon echoes condemnation U.S. President Joe Biden sharply criticized the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague following its decision to issue arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant. In a statement delivered late Thursday night, Biden said, 'The ICC issuance of arrest warrants against Israeli leaders is outrageous. Let me be clear once again: whatever the ICC might imply, there is no equivalence — none — between Israel and Hamas. We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security.' Biden's statement followed a response from the U.S. Pentagon on the warrants. Deputy Pentagon Spokesperson Sabrina Singh said on Thursday that the Pentagon rejected the ICC's decision and is concerned about the expedited manner in which the warrants were issued. According to her, senior Pentagon officials are currently consulting with their Israeli counterparts about the next steps. 'We're continuing to support Israel with the assistance it needs in its fight against Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah, we don't see eye-to-eye on where the ICC is and we reject the court's decision to issue these arrest warrants,' Singh noted. The ICC on Thursday announced that it had rejected appeals against the move submitted by Israel and issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, who was recently dismissed. The court also issued an arrest warrant for Mohammed Deif, despite reports of his elimination, as Hamas has not confirmed his death.

IAEA Board passes Iran resolution as West pushes Tehran toward ta...	UN atomic watchdog orders Tehran to improve cooperation with agency and provide it with 'comprehensive' report; Iran warns action against it could have the opposite effect The UN atomic watchdog's 35-nation Board of Governors passed a resolution on Thursday again ordering Iran to urgently improve cooperation with the agency and requesting a 'comprehensive' report aimed at pressuring Iran into fresh nuclear talks. The UK, France, Germany and the United States, which proposed the resolution, dismissed as insufficient and insincere a last-minute Iranian move to cap its stock of uranium that is close to weapons-grade. Diplomats said Iran's move was conditional on scrapping the resolution. Iran tends to bristle at such resolutions and has said it would respond in kind to this one. After previous criticism at the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board, it has stepped up its nuclear activities and reduced IAEA oversight. China, Russia and Burkina Faso voted against the text, diplomats in the meeting said. Nineteen countries voted in favor and 12 abstained. The IAEA and Iran have long been locked in standoffs on a range of issues including Tehran's failure to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites, its barring last year of most of the agency's top uranium-enrichment experts on the Iran inspection team, and its refusal to expand IAEA monitoring. The resolution seen by Reuters repeated wording from a November 2022 resolution that it was 'essential and urgent' for Iran to explain the uranium traces and let the IAEA take samples as necessary. The resolution in June of this year did the same. The new text asked the IAEA to issue 'a comprehensive and updated assessment on the possible presence or use of undeclared nuclear material in connection with past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran's nuclear program, including a full account of Iran's cooperation with the IAEA on these issues'. Western powers hope that report, due by spring 2025, will pressure Iran into negotiations on fresh restrictions on its nuclear activities, albeit less far-reaching ones than in a 2015 deal with major powers that unraveled after then-President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from it in 2018. With Trump due to return to office in January and Iran having taken its uranium enrichment far beyond the deal's limits, it is far from clear whether Trump would back negotiations aimed at setting new limits before the 2015 deal's ones are lifted on 'termination day' in October of next year. If no new limits are agreed before then, the report could be used to strengthen the case for so-called 'snapback', a process under the 2015 deal where the issue is sent to the U.N. Security Council and sanctions lifted under the deal can be re-imposed. Last week IAEA chief Rafael Grossi visited Tehran, hoping to convince new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is seen as relatively moderate, to improve Iran's cooperation with the agency. Iranian reaction Grossi formally reported to member states on Tuesday that 'the possibility of Iran not further expanding its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% U-235 was discussed' in his meetings with Iranian officials, and that the IAEA had verified Iran had 'begun implementation of preparatory measures'. Iran already has enough material enriched to that level, close to the roughly 90% purity that is weapons grade, for four nuclear weapons if enriched further, according to an IAEA yardstick. It has enough material enriched to lower levels for more bombs, but Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons. Grossi said on Wednesday he had asked Iran to cap that stock of 60% material and Iran had accepted his request. He told a news conference that day that it was 'a concrete step in the right direction', suggesting that he felt a resolution could undermine that progress. With the resolution passed, Iran is likely to respond.

Lebanon cease-fire could come 'within days', Israeli officials es...	Despite report claiming Lebanon has yet to agree to certain terms of the U.S.-led agreement, lawmakers say deal could be finalized by the weekend Lebanon seeks to modify the terms of the U.S.-proposed cease-fire agreement to ensure a 'speedier withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon and to give both parties the right to self-defense,' Reuters reported on Thursday amid U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein's visit to Israel directly from Beirut. According to a senior Lebanese official, the country’s negotiators requested these changes during meetings with Hochstein in Beirut. These amendments – previously unrequested by Lebanon – indicate that Hochstein still has significant hurdles to overcome to finalize the deal, despite his earlier statement in Beirut that an agreement was 'within reach.' The Lebanese official added that Lebanon wishes for Israeli forces to withdraw immediately after the cease-fire is declared, allowing the Lebanese Army to deploy across all areas and displaced persons to return to their homes. This position contradicts Israel’s stance, which envisioned a withdrawal within 60 days of the cease-fire taking effect. Lebanon also seeks a revision in the proposal to stress both sides' right to 'self-defense,' not just Israel's. The source noted that while the American draft refers to a withdrawal from 'Lebanese borders,' Beirut preferred specific wording referring to the 'Lebanese border' to ensure a complete Israeli withdrawal. Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said on Wednesday that Lebanon wants to enforce Hezbollah’s evacuation from southern Lebanon on its own terms, rather than via Israeli actions. Israel, for its part, demanded to prevent the terror organization from smuggling weapons into Lebanon by land, sea or air and insisted on guarantees that it can enforce this as a fundamental condition of any agreement. The Lebanese official noted that the U.S. draft makes no mention of Israel’s ability to continue striking Hezbollah and stressed that Lebanon insists on maintaining its sovereignty. Israel has also agreed to an addendum providing U.S. assurances that it can target Hezbollah in the future should the agreement be violated. Hochstein arrived in Israel on Wednesday after visiting Lebanon and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He also held talks with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a close confidant of the prime minister and then met with Defense Minister Israel Katz and IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi. Following these meetings, senior Israeli officials estimated that, despite the new conditions reported by Reuters, the agreement with Lebanon is likely to be finalized 'within days.' Meanwhile, official Lebanese sources told Sky News Arabia that 'the negotiations could lead to an agreement by the weekend, barring any obstacles.' However, estimates say the cease-fire announcement is unlikely to take this week and possibly not even next week.

IAEA Board passes Iran resolution as West pushes Tehran toward ta...	The U.N. atomic watchdog's 35-nation Board of Governors passed a resolution on Thursday again ordering Iran to urgently improve cooperation with the agency and requesting a 'comprehensive' report aimed at pressuring Iran into fresh nuclear talks. Britain, France, Germany and the United States, which proposed the resolution, dismissed as insufficient and insincere a last-minute Iranian move to cap its stock of uranium that is close to weapons-grade. Diplomats said Iran's move was conditional on scrapping the resolution. China, Russia and Burkina Faso voted against the text, diplomats in the meeting said. Nineteen countries voted in favor and 12 abstained. The resolution seen by Reuters repeated wording from a November 2022 resolution that it was 'essential and urgent' for Iran to explain the uranium traces found at undeclared sites and let the IAEA take samples as necessary.

State visit of Dutch foreign minister canceled as world reacts to...	Office of Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar says he spoke with Kasper Waldekamp and the two agreed his planned visit to the country should be postponed; Some countries support UN court's action while others say won't listen to warrants Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar canceled his Dutch counterpart Kasper Waldekamp’s visit to Israel set for Monday after the Netherlands, which hosts the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, became the first country to declare it would honor the court's arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant. Sa'ar spoke with Waldekamp, after which his office issued a statement. 'Minister Sa'ar expressed his disappointment, on behalf of the Israeli government and people, over the statement made in the Dutch Parliament following the ICC decision,' the statement said. 'The minister also presented Israel's stance regarding this scandalous and politically motivated decision. It was agreed during the conversation that the Dutch foreign minister's visit to Israel, planned for Monday, would not take place,' the statement added. Geert Wilders, the leader of the ruling coalition in the Netherlands and a vocal supporter of Israel, has yet to comment on the ICC decision. Meanwhile, Sa'ar engaged with his counterparts in two ICC member states – Argentina and Hungary – condemning the decision in strong terms. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto harshly criticized the warrant, calling it 'shameful and absurd.' 'This decision disgraces the international judiciary by equating leaders of a country attacked by a heinous terror attack with the leaders of the terrorist organization responsible,' he added. Argentine president Javier Milei also weighed in, saying his country 'declares its deep disagreement' with the ruling which 'ignores Israel's legitimate right to defend itself against ongoing attacks by terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah.' Another ICC member state, the UK, refused to commit to abide by the court’s ruling. 'This government has been clear that Israel has a right to defend itself, in accordance with international law. There is no moral equivalence between Israel, a democracy, and Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah, which are terrorist organizations,' a UK government spokesman said. Italy would have to arrest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he came to the country, Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said on Thursday. Meanwhile, the deputy speaker of the Czech parliament called on the parliament to consider a 'temporary suspension of Czech participation in the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute' and membership in the ICC, as well as re-evaluating the country's financial contributions to the court in The Hague. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded to questions about his view of the ICC decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. 'Everyone has to abide by international law,' Trudeau said. He added that Canada 'will abide by all the regulations and rulings of the international court.' Following the court’s decision, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar instructed Israeli ambassadors worldwide to 'engage influencers in general, not just those in power, foreign ministries or the prime minister's office. In some countries, it might be the opposition that could strongly voice opposition to this. And we need that. We need those voices to be heard.' 'A modern Dreyfus trial' Meanwhile, Netanyahu's office commented on the UN top court's decision. 'The antisemitic decision of the International Criminal Court is a modern Dreyfus trial – and will end the same way. Israel utterly rejects the false and absurd charges of the International Criminal Court, a biased and discriminatory political body,' the PMO said in a statement. 'No war is more just than the war Israel has been waging in Gaza since October 7, 2023, when the Hamas terrorist organization launched a murderous assault and perpetrated the largest massacre against the Jewish People since the Holocaust,' it added. 'The decision to issue an arrest warrant against the Prime Minister was made by a corrupt chief prosecutor who is trying to save himself from sexual harassment accusations and biased judges who are motivated by antisemitic hatred of Israel. 'The ICC prosecutor lied when he told American senators that he would take no action until he had visited Israel and heard its side. Instead, he cancelled his arrival in Israel last May, several days after suspicions of sexual harassment were made against him, and announced his intention to issue arrest warrants against the Prime Minister and former Defense Minister.' 'No anti-Israel decision will prevent the State of Israel from defending its citizens. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not give in to pressure. He will continue to pursue all the objectives that Israel set out to achieve in its just war against Hamas and the Iranian axis of terror,' the statement concluded.

First sergeant Ron Epshtein is 29th soldier killed in current rai...	Soldier, 19, , was killed by an artillery shell in the northern Gaza Strip, though it is not clear whether it was fired by Hamas or the IDF; The raid in Jabaliya, the 3rd since the war started, began last month and hundreds of terrorists have been killed or arrested First sergeant Ron Epshtein, 19, from Nesher, a soldier in the Tzabar Battalion, Givati Brigade, was killed Thursday by an artillery shell in Jabaliya, becoming the 29th IDF casualty since the raid began in the northern Gaza Strip last month. It is not clear whether the shell was fired by Hamas or the IDF. Epshtein, the son of Dimitri and Olga and brother to Daniel, Dina and Maya, was a student at the Hebrew Reali School of Haifa. He is the 14th fallen soldier from the Reali School since the beginning of the war. The director of the school, Yossi Ben David, said announced Epshtein's death in GAza and noted that his sister Maya is in 12th grade at the school and that his older siblings also were graduates of the school. The municipality paid tribute to its native son. 'The city of Nesher bows its head upon receiving the news of the death of Sergeant Ron Epshtein, a native of the city, a soldier in the Tzabar Battalion (432) from the Givati ​​Brigade, who fell in battle in the northern Gaza Strip. In this unbearably difficult time, we want to hug the Epshtein family, parents Dimitri and Olga and his siblings Daniel, Dina and Maya. May God grant that you will know no more sorrow. May his memory be blessed and engraved forever in our hearts.' On Wednesday the IDF announced that Sergeant First Class (res.) Roi Sasson, 21, from Mevaseret Zion, a soldier in the Nachshon Battalion of the Kfir Brigade, fell Tuesday in an encounter with terrorists in Jabaliya. In the same incident, the commander of the Nachshon Battalion, Kfir Brigade, Lt. Col. Yoel Glickman, was seriously injured, though his life is not in danger. A preliminary investigation of the encounter reveals that the force under Glickman's command was ambushed by a terrorist squad that was waiting inside a building, and came at the end of the battalion's attack on a target in the seam between Beit Lahia and Jabaliya. On Sunday, the Nachshon Battalion had two more soldiers who fell in battle in Jabaliya, who fell in the battle in Jabaliya, Captain Yogev Pazy and Staff Sergeant Noam Eitan. A day before, Sergeant First Class (res.) Idan Kenan Cohen from the battalion also fell in battle. The raid on Jabaliya began about a month and a half ago, although the IDF had already raided the city twice before in the past year - first during an operation in December, and in May and June of this year. Among the 29 dead are also quite a few officers, including the commander of the Israel Defense Force's 401st Armored Brigade, Col. Ehsan Daqsa. In this raid, the forces are scanning Hamas headquarters, mainly in the city's refugee camp, and are also putting pressure on the two neighboring towns, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia, in order to move the remaining population south toward Gaza City, and then to continue even further south, beyond the Netzarim Corridor and the southern Gaza Strip. IDF forces are discovering weapons caches daily and engaging with terrorists regularly. The primary threat remains IEDs: Hamas has rigged more than 200 buildings in Jabaliya, primarily with 'dumb' explosives using improvised tripwires but without surveillance cameras. The IDF estimates this operation will be more prolonged than previous ones, potentially lasting several more weeks. Three IDF brigades under the 162nd Division are participating in the raid. The IDF has identified Jabaliya as a core Hamas stronghold in northern Gaza, where hundreds of terrorists — including senior commanders — have converged. Despite the IDF managing to evacuate tens of thousands of residents from the city over the past month, breaking what the IDF describes as a 'fear barrier' imposed by Hamas, a few thousand civilians remain.

Can't determine Deif has been killed': ICC's charges against for...	UN's top court issues arrest warrant against presumed killed Hamas military leader Mohammad Deif alongside Netanyahu and Gallant The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague issued an arrest warrant for the former head of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, who was reportedly killed last July in an IDF strike in Khan Younis. In the same decision, the court also issued warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Deif was charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes months after the IDF announced Deif's assassination. According to the ICC, the reason behind the warrant is the inability to determine whether Deif was killed. The serious charges against him include 'crimes against humanity of murder; extermination; torture; and rape and other form of sexual violence; as well as the war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, torture, taking hostages; outrages upon personal dignity; and rape and other form of sexual violence.' The ICC's announcement said the alleged crimes attributed to Deif took place 'on the territory of the State of Israel and the State of Palestine from at least 7 October 2023.' It was also noted the prosecution initially filed requests for arrest warrants against two other Hamas leaders, Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar, who have since been killed. 'Following confirmation of their deaths, the Chamber granted the withdrawal of the applications on 9 August 2024 and 25 October 2024, respectively. With respect to Mr. Deif, the Prosecution indicated that it would continue to gather information with respect to his reported death,' the statement read. 'On 15 November 2024, the Prosecution, referring to information from both the Israeli and Palestinian authorities, notified the Chamber that it is not in a position to determine whether Mr Deif has been killed or remains alive. Therefore, the Chamber issues the present warrant of arrest,' it added. 'The warrant of arrest for Mr. Deif is classified as ‘secret’ in order to protect witnesses and to safeguard the conduct of investigations. However, the Chamber decided to release the information below since conduct similar to that addressed in the warrant of arrest appears to be ongoing, in particular the holding of a number of hostages captive. The Chamber considers it is also in the interest of victims and their families to be aware of the warrant’s existence,' the ICC stressed. 'The Chamber found reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Deif, born in 1965, the highest commander of the military wing of Hamas (known as the al-Qassam Brigades) at the time of the alleged conduct, is responsible for the crimes against humanity of murder; extermination; torture; and rape and other form of sexual violence; as well as the war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, torture, taking hostages; outrages upon personal dignity; and rape and other form of sexual violence.' 'The Chamber found reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Deif bears criminal responsibility for the aforementioned crimes for having committed the acts jointly and through others and having ordered or induced the commission of the crimes, and for his failure to exercise proper control over forces under his effective command and control,' it added. 'The Chamber found reasonable grounds to believe that during the relevant time, international humanitarian law related to international armed conflict (between Israel and Palestine) and non-international armed conflict (between Israel and Hamas) applied. The Chamber also found that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the crimes against humanity were part of a widespread and systematic attack directed by Hamas and other armed groups against the civilian population of Israel.'

Sending a message to Assad: New details behind the unusual attack...	At least 82 Hezbollah terrorists and militia leaders were killed while the Syrian president was hosting them, and the timing at the height of cease-fire negotiations is no coincidence; 'Israeli attacks in Syria have increased significantly, both in frequency and scope' Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition organization based in London, reported Thursday evening that at least 82 terrorists and commanders in the pro-Iranian militias and the Lebanese Hezbollah organization were killed in the unusual attack in Syria attributed to Israel in Tadmor. According to the group, 56 of the dead are Syrians affiliated with the pro-Iranian militias, and 22 are of non-Syrian nationality, most of them from the pro-Iranian Iraqi al-Nujaba militia. Next to them, four Hezbollah members also were killed. If the reports are correct, it appears that this is a message to Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is hosting senior members of Hezbollah, and therefore Israel is increasing the pressure on the terrorist organization, precisely at the height of negotiations toward a cease-fire, and maximizing success in hitting it not only in Lebanon. Najat Rochdi, the UN's special deputy envoy for Syria, expressed concern about the escalation in the region, telling the UN Security Council that 'the Israeli attacks are probably the deadliest that have hit Syria so far.' According to her, 'Israeli attacks in Syria have increased significantly, both in frequency and scope.' She pointed out that Israel says its attacks are aimed at targets related to Iran, Hezbollah or the Islamic Jihad, but in practice 'there are civilian casualties, including in large attacks on residential areas in the heart of Damascus' that took place recently. She also expressed concern about the 'volatile situation' in the Golan Heights and northwestern Syria, and clarified that 'this year is on track to be the most violent in Syria since 2020, and the risk of even greater destruction is still on the horizon.' After Wednesday's attack, which targeted the city of Tadmor in the Syrian desert, the Ministry of Defense in Syria claimed that Israel attacked from the air from the area of ​​the American military base at Tanaf, which is located in the Syria-Jordan-Iraq border triangle. The ministry has so far reported only 36 deaths, in contrast to the number stated by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and also significant material damage to the buildings that came under attack and their surroundings. In the report, the Syrian Observatory stated that the attack was aimed at three separate sites in the city of Tadmor, two of them in the Al-Jamaiya neighborhood; One of the sites is a weapons depot near an industrial area. The area reportedly is home to families of pro-Iranian activists who have Iraqi citizenship. And in the third site that was attacked, according to the Syrian Observatory, there was a meeting of leaders from the pro-Iranian militias who are in Tadmor, including senior officials from the pro-Iranian Iraqi al-Nujaba militia and a leader from Hezbollah. Meanwhile, an IDF force arrested a Syrian suspect on Thursday who breached the border fence into the southern Golan Heights. The suspect did not stop when ordered to by the soldiers, who shot him in the leg. He was then transferred to Ziv Hospital in Safed for further treatment and investigation, according to the IDF. The Syrian radio station 'Sham FM' commented on the incident, and claimed that the IDF 'kidnapped a 63-year-old civilian who was herding cattle in the area between Syria and Israel, which is under the control of the United Nations, west of the village of A-Rapid in the southern countryside of Quneitra.'

Biden, Trump officials reject ICC warrants against Netanyahu and ...	U.S. lawmakers condemn UN Court's decision to issue the warrants saying the current and next administrations won't abide by them; 'Expect a strong response in January,' Trump official says The White House on Thursday condemned the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) issuing of arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, saying that it 'fundamentally rejects the Court’s decision.' U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby added that: 'We remain deeply concerned by the prosecutor’s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision.' He said the U.S. will discuss its next steps with its partners. Earlier, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s chosen national security advisor Michael Waltz criticized the ICC, saying that it lacked credibility. 'These allegations have been refuted by the U.S. government,' he added. Waltz, whom Trump intends to appoint as his advisor upon taking office, added that 'Israel has lawfully defended its people and borders from genocidal terrorists. You can expect a strong response to the antisemitic bias of the ICC & UN come January.' Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, representing South Carolina, also condemned the ICC’s decision, saying that the ' International Corrupt Criminal Court has acted in the most absurd and irresponsible manner possible by issuing arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant while there's a serious cloud of allegations hanging out over the prosecutor who sought these warrants.' 'If we do not act forcefully against the ICC after their outrageous decision to issue arrest warrants for the duly elected Israeli Prime Minister and former Minister of Defense, we are making a huge mistake, and I fear the United States is next,' he added. The immediate implication of the warrants means that Netanyahu and Gallant are effectively confined to Israel – they can't travel abroad, especially not to any of the 124 ICC member states, which include most European, African and South American countries. While Netanyahu and Gallant could potentially visit these nations, it would require convincing them not to enforce the warrants. In practice, this means Netanyahu is becoming an 'ostracized' leader. However, the U.S. isn't a member of the ICC and hasn't signed the Rome Statute that governs it, so Netanyahu wouldn't face travel issues there. Nevertheless, logistical challenges could arise regarding flight routes, as some countries might bar Israel’s state aircraft from passage through their airspace. Graham also called for an independent investigation into the prosecutor's misconduct, saying that issuing a warrant based on such work undermines any sense of fairness and the rule of law.

Czech lawmaker says ICC decision legalizes antisemitism on a glob...	Jan Bartošek condemned the ICC decision to issue arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. 'Today, at a time when the world public is alarmed by the rise of antisemitism, when world politicians are condemning its violent manifestations, as in the recent attack on Jews in the streets of Amsterdam, we are witnessing an absolutely unprecedented decision that de facto legalizes antisemitism on a global level,' he posted on social media. 'Moreover, the decision of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Galant is an unprecedented legal act, as it concerns the democratically elected prime minister of a sovereign country. The ICC has thus contributed to the overall atmosphere of uncertainty in the current world order. It equates terrorists with legally elected state leaders, which in practical terms can only embolden terrorist movements around the world.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bktqikazjx	2024-11-21T08:20:42-08:00

Argentine President Javier Millay responded to the decision of the International Criminal Court in The Hague (ICC) to issue arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Argentina 'expresses its profound disagreement with the recent decision of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to issue arrest warrants against the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the former Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant. This resolution ignores Israel's legitimate right to defend itself against constant attacks by terrorist organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah. Israel faces brutal aggression, inhumane hostage-taking, and the indiscriminate launching of attacks against its population. Criminalizing the legitimate defense of a nation while ignoring these atrocities is an act that distorts the spirit of international justice. Argentina stands in solidarity with Israel, reaffirms its right to protect its people, and demands the immediate release of all hostages.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byvu9ypzjg	2024-11-21T08:16:46-08:00

Lone soldiers reflect on reason for making aliyah, join war effor...	Sergeant First Class Eli Zivan was in Mexico when the war broke out, and just 2 days later he was in the Gaza border area; Sergeant Major Yoni Heilman joined the IDF in 2002 as a lone soldier and afterward lived in both countries, but the war made it clear to him Israel was a core part of his identity Sergeant First Class Eli Zivan and Sergeant Major Yoni Heilman have always felt a deep connection to Israel, which inspired them to serve as lone soldiers in the IDF. When war broke out on October 7, they immediately took action to join the fight, reaffirming for them that Israel was their home. Yoni, tell us a little about yourself, and how you made aliyah to Israel the first time. 'I grew up back and forth between Israel and America,' Heilman began. 'I first served in Nahal as a volunteer through the Mahal program, and I made aliyah with my wife in 2009 when we were expecting our first child. We returned to the United States for a time but made aliyah again a few years ago.' Heilman’s connection to Israel has always been strong. His initial service as a lone soldier reflected his commitment to making Israel his home. And I understand that you made aliyah as a lone soldier. What was your motivation? 'I always knew I would spend my life in Israel, but I wasn’t quite ready to make aliyah at 18. Still, I wanted to serve in the army and be ready to answer the call when needed,' Heilman explained. In 2002, shortly after Operation Defensive Shield, Heilman came to Israel as a lone soldier in the Nahal Brigade. 'I grew up in a Zionist household where Israel was a core part of my identity. For me, serving was about earning my place in this country,' he said. Eli, for you, it was a bit different because you made aliyah with your family. How was it for you? Zivan shared that he is the youngest of five brothers, all of whom served in combat units during the war. 'We were raised in a Zionist home with the understanding that Israel is our land, and this is where we live our lives,' he said. 'Every day during this war, I felt like I was fulfilling the Zionist dream I grew up with. I was doing exactly what my upbringing prepared me for,' Zivan added. Where did October 7 catch you? Zivan recalled being in Mexico on the Pacific coast between school semesters when news of the terror attacks broke. 'I saw what was happening on my phone and immediately started making calls. The Mexican consulate helped me secure a flight, and by October 9 I was back with my team,' he said. Soon after his return, Zivan and his unit were clearing the area around the Nova music festival and nearby kibbutzim, preparing for the next steps in the military operation. Heilman, already in Israel on October 7, was at home in Modi’in with his family. 'I was about to leave for an errand when I got the call. By 9:30 a.m. or 10 a.m., I was at our base, gathering gear. Thirty-six hours later, we were in the south, working in the same areas Eli mentioned, including the Nova festival and several kibbutzim,' he said. I understand that you decided to document your experience in a WhatsApp group. You have many followers. 'Yes,' Heilman confirmed. 'It started as updates to my wife, then my family. Eventually, it grew to include hundreds of people.' For Heilman, writing became a form of processing the intense experiences of war. 'Every day, I’d put my thoughts down as a way to clear my mind enough to sleep for a few hours. It wasn’t my intention to attract so many readers, but people wanted to feel connected to what was happening on the front lines,' he said. What do you share? 'Mostly, I share my feelings,' Heilman explained. 'I can’t always describe what I’ve seen or experienced, but I try to convey the emotional reality. In the first month, our unit focused on securing areas and performing the tragic but sacred duty of collecting our fallen brothers and sisters.' He also highlighted the inspiration he drew from his fellow soldiers. 'The heartbreak was immense, but the commitment of so many soldiers showing up, ready to do whatever was needed to make this country safer, was profoundly moving,' he said. A message you wish to convey, both of you. Zivan began, 'My greatest wish is for the safe return of all 101 hostages and for everyone serving to come home safely. I hope we complete this mission at the highest level, so our friends and brothers who fell for this country will not have done so in vain.' Heilman echoed these sentiments. 'There’s been a lot of discussion about the heavy burden on the nation, and while we are tired, it’s an honor to be part of this effort. We are not ready to go home until everyone is brought back, and we’ve made this country safe again.'

Is it safe to be Jewish in Spain?	Student Erica Mahler says Jewish, Israeli friends have faced 'aggression' A young Jewish woman has shared her fears about openly expressing her Jewish identity in Spain as antisemitism continues to rise in the country. Speaking to ILTV News, Erica Mahler, a student at the University of Barcelona, said, 'There have been a lot of incidents with my friends where they have shown they are Jewish or Israeli, and they have been faced with aggression.' She mentioned a recent incident in her neighborhood where a mezuzah was ripped off someone’s door. 'So, there is sort of a fear of showing openly that you're Israeli or Jewish, but at the same time, it's not stopping us from moving forward and trying to educate the people so that we can live openly within our society,' Mahler added. Watch the full interview: Spain has experienced one of the largest spikes in antisemitism since the war. According to a recent report by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 78% of Spanish Jews consider antisemitism to be a very big or fairly big problem in the country. Additionally, Spain is one of three countries, alongside Ireland and Norway, to formally recognize a unified Palestinian state under the Palestinian Authority. This recognition comes despite Israel’s parliament ruling that it will not recognize or allow such a state at this time.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sknnrtnmyg	2024-11-21T05:42:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/21/ryDiL63GJg/ryDiL63GJg_137_1_805_453_0_small.jpg
Ex-Israeli turns Menendez brothers' mansion into a home that host...	For years – until it was sold for $17 million shortly before the release of the series 'Monsters,' which spotlighted the infamous murder in the lavish Beverly Hills mansion – Sam Delug lived in the villa and hosted approximately 75 fundraising events in support of Israel For years, the stunning mansion on Elm Drive in Beverly Hills has been a magnet for curious onlookers and tourist buses eager to catch a glimpse of celebrity homes. Recently, interest in the property surged, thanks to Netflix’s 'Monsters' series chronicling the story of Lyle and Erik Menendez. The mansion’s dark history as the scene of one of the world’s most infamous murders has long fascinated the public. It turns out the home has a connection to a former Israeli, Sam Delug. Until a few months ago, Delug owned the property and, while he found the endless curiosity puzzling, it didn’t bother him much after the first few years. 'When I first moved in, people wouldn’t just stare from a distance – they’d knock on the door and ask to come inside as if it were a museum,' Delug recalls. 'I’d tell them, ‘If you don’t leave my property, I’ll call the police.’ But that only lasted two or three years, and then it stopped.' Delug, a warm-hearted entrepreneur, lawyer, and philanthropist, was born in Melbourne, Australia. He moved to Israel with his family at age seven and lived there for three years before relocating to New York and eventually settling in Los Angeles. The tragedy that shocked Beverly Hills and the U.S. The murders of Jose and Mary Louise 'Kitty' Menendez horrified the elite neighborhood of Beverly Hills –and the entire nation. On August 20, 1989, the couple was relaxing in the living room of their mansion, watching television, when their sons entered and fatally shot them. Jose was struck six times, and Kitty was shot 10 times. Later that night, the brothers called the police, claiming they had found their parents dead. Initially, suspicion turned toward external threats, including the local mafia. But the brothers drew attention when they began spending millions of dollars from their inheritance soon after the murders. Investigators eventually tied them to the crime when Erik confessed to his psychologist, who alerted the authorities. During their high-profile trial, the Menendez brothers claimed they had suffered years of sexual abuse at the hands of their father, which drove them to commit the murders. Despite their defense, they were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. From infamous crime scene to renovated haven The mansion changed hands for the first time in 1991 and was sold two years later to William Link, co-creator of the TV series 'Murder, She Wrote.' In 2001, Sam Delug purchased the home for $3.7 million. Before buying, Delug visited the house with his three children, then young adults, to gauge their feelings. 'I wanted to make sure they felt comfortable,' he says. 'My youngest was 19 at the time, and none of them lived with me anymore, but I still wanted each of them to have a room to call their own when they visited. They told me, ‘Dad, it’s just another house. We’re fine with it.’' Built in 1927, the house was dated by the time Delug moved in, so he hired an interior designer to renovate the entire property. The exterior, however, was left untouched, maintaining the structure’s historic charm. The infamous living room where the murders occurred was transformed into a bright, welcoming TV room with doors leading to the garden. 'Most people wouldn’t believe such a tragedy took place in that space,' Delug says. 'It’s now light, inviting and peaceful.' After the renovation, Delug began hosting charity events at the mansion, primarily for Jewish and pro-Israel organizations. Groups like Stand With Us, AIPAC, and the Maccabiah Games regularly benefitted from his gatherings. The mansion also became a venue for other causes, such as fundraisers for Beit Halochem and Israel Bonds. 'I’m 100% a Zionist,' Delug says proudly. A legacy of community and philanthropy Over the years, Delug’s home became a hub for philanthropy. Notable speakers, such as Yoseph Haddad, an activist for Israel’s image abroad, and Micky Kubi, a former senior Shin Bet investigator, have shared their stories at events there. 'I started getting involved in the community 20 years ago, and for the past 15 years I’ve hosted four to five major events a year,' Delug says. 'Altogether, I’ve probably hosted about 75 events, including a break-fast meal after Yom Kippur. Anyone without a place to go is welcome. That’s my first mitzvah of the year.' Delug visits Israel twice a year and has a deep connection to the country. After arriving for a visit shortly before October 7, 2023, he found himself stranded in Israel due to the outbreak of war. 'I was supposed to leave on October 11 and meet my son in Italy, but I couldn’t go,' he recalls. Earlier in the year, he returned to Israel with a Stand With Us delegation, organizing a barbecue for soldiers and bringing musicians to perform for them. 'They appreciated it so much,' he says. Saying goodbye to Elm Drive After 22 years in the Elm Drive mansion, Delug decided it was time to move on. 'To be honest, I was tired of people referring to it as ‘the Menendez house.’ Nobody could just say I lived in Los Angeles. Well, now they can’t say that anymore,' he says, half-jokingly. During his time there, Delug says he never felt any negative energy in the home. On the contrary, it became a vibrant space filled with joy and purpose. Still, leaving wasn’t easy. 'This house holds some of the best memories of my life,' he admits. 'But I believe in creating new memories.' The seven-bedroom, nine-bathroom estate sold earlier this year for approximately $17 million, closing a chapter in its long and storied history.

Travel to and from Israel remains difficult, but relief may be on...	Arkia and Israir have received government approval to begin operating flights to the United States in the coming weeks Since the start of the ongoing war, numerous airlines have suspended flights to and from Israel, making travel both challenging and extremely expensive. Now, two Israeli airlines have made an announcement that could ease the burden. Air travel in and out of Israel has faced significant challenges. Due to the war and escalating tensions in the north, major carriers like Lufthansa, Air France, Virgin Atlantic, and United Airlines have suspended flights to Tel Aviv, leaving Israeli airline El Al as the sole operator connecting Israel to the United States. This lack of competition has caused flight prices to soar, making air travel an unaffordable luxury for many. But there’s hope on the horizon. Arkia and Israir have received government approval to begin operating flights to the United States in the coming weeks. Both airlines plan to lease aircraft from Europe and operate ten weekly flights with foreign crews. Their entry into the U.S. market is expected to increase competition and potentially lower fares for travelers. Meanwhile, the list of suspended flights continues to grow. Airlines such as Air France, British Airways, and American Airlines have announced delays in resuming service to Israel, with some pushing return dates as far back as late 2025 due to operational challenges and security concerns.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h15syangyl	2024-11-21T05:14:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/16/rJcDGtXET/rJcDGtXET_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Ex-justice minister Ayelet Shaked claims Australia denied entry v...	Shaked slams Australian government as 'anti-Israeli' and 'antisemitic,' adding that 'These are dark days for Australian democracy' as Canberra chose 'the wrong side of history' Former justice minister Ayelet Shaked said Thursday that Australia refused to grant her a visa to enter the country, a move she attributed to political motives, namely due to her opposition to Palestinian statehood. 'The current Australian government is anti-Israeli, extremely pro-Palestinian and in some parts even antisemitic,' Shaked said. 'Because of my opposition to a Palestinian state, they won’t allow me to visit and engage in strategic dialogue between our countries. These are dark days for Australian democracy, and this government has chosen the wrong side of history.' According to Shaked, she traveled to 'participate in a strategic dialogue between the countries at the AIJAC conference.' She said the decision by the Labor government was 'a clear testament to its hypocrisy and its hostile stance toward Israel.' Like many countries around the world, the war in Gaza, which began following the October 7 massacre, has sparked heated political debates in Australia. While the left-wing Labor government has repeatedly called for a cease-fire, it has, unlike countries such as Spain, Ireland and Norway—who have been more critical of Israel—avoided recognizing a Palestinian state. Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization in Australia. Throughout the summer, Australia’s political system was embroiled in debates over whether to allow Palestinian refugees to remain in the country or continue to arrive due to the ongoing war in Gaza. Canberra announced plans to extend the temporary visas of refugees who had already arrived, while the conservative opposition leader called for an outright ban on the arrival of Gazans, fearing that some might pose a security risk. According to Australian broadcaster ABC, by August, the government had granted nearly 3,000 'visitor' visas to Palestinians who had fled Gaza or the West Bank after October 7. However, only about half of them had actually arrived in Australia, and another 7,000 applications were rejected. The visas granted were temporary, and due to the ongoing war, their validity is set to expire soon. The Australian government has stated it is exploring ways to extend the stay of the Palestinian refugees.

TESTING	TESTING A Melburne woman who disappeared last month was allegedly murdered by her 'sugar daddy,' whose friend, an Israeli man, is accused of helping him dispose of her body, according to police documents released by the Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Wednesday evening. The remains, believed to belong to 19-year-old Isla Bell, were found in a trash site Tuesday morning, though formal identification is pending. According to the indictment, Marat Ganiev, 53, is accused of killing Bell just after midnight on October 7, days before her 20th birthday, while his friend, Eyal Yaffe, 57, allegedly assisted in covering up the crime. Australian media reported that Bell was last seen leaving her Brunswick home on October 4. In a message sent to a friend shortly before her death, Bell described Ganiev as 'the best Russian sugar daddy' who was lavishing her with gifts and had saved her from 'sex traffickers.' Authorities believe Bell was killed in Ganiev’s apartment kitchen. Surveillance footage reportedly showed her entering his residence on October 5, with no evidence of her leaving. Police allege that Ganiev, a reported heroin addict, and Yaffe placed Bell’s body in a fridge, which was moved to other locations around Melbourne. On November 18, a man discovered the fridge on the street and, after unwrapping it, discarded a bag from inside, thinking it contained animal remains. He left the fridge on the street of a Melbourne suburb, where police found it the next day. Bell’s remains were later identified at a landfill in Dandenong, another Melbourne suburb. Ganiev faces charges of murder. Yaffe, who police say planned to flee to Bulgaria, has been charged with being an accessory after the fact. In court, Yaffe reportedly admitted to disposing of Bell’s body but denied involvement in the killing. He was seen smiling and interacting with guards and family members during his court appearance. Bell’s mother, Justine Spokes, paid tribute to her daughter on the day her body was found. 'Cherished forever and suffering no more,' she said. 'I am so sorry I could not protect you, that your experience of the world was cruel and unsafe. Despite your challenges, you lived bravely, stood up for what was right and remained the kindest human, the gentlest soul… With the deepest love and respect, your Mumma.'

Jews from across North America share stories of renewal, resilien...	Eshkol Mayor Michal Uziyahu at the event: 'Our story did not start on October 7 and for sure it did not end that day either' More than 2,500 people came together last week in Dallas for the Jewish National Fund’s annual conference, titled 'We Choose Life: Rebuilding and Reimagining Israel's North and South.' The conference focused on the land and people of Israel, emphasizing a message that transcends politics—it's not about Right or Left, red or blue, but about building a brighter future for the Jewish state. 'It’s amazing to know there are this many people who have come together with a common goal of securing Israel, dealing with obviously the issues of antisemitism and education,' said Deb Lust Zaluda, president of JNF-USA. 'These are all people that share the same values as I have.' Among the speakers were prominent Israeli leaders, including Michal Uziyahu, Mayor of Eshkol—a region ravaged by Hamas attacks—and Nisan Zeevi, Commander of the Emergency Squad in Kfar Giladi, a community under threat from Hezbollah. Both shared inspiring messages of hope and resilience. Currently, around 65,000 Israelis remain displaced from their homes in the North. This region, where JNF-USA has invested heavily for decades, has faced relentless Hezbollah rocket fire since October 8. In response, JNF-USA has not only provided critical funding but also partnered with local communities to reimagine and rebuild a brighter future. 'Our story did not start on October 7 and for sure it did not end that day either,' said Eshkol Mayor Michal Uziyahu. 'Our story is a story of light, of life and of hope.' 'Together we can - we will - make the Galilee great again,' added Nisan Zeevi, commander of the Kfar Giladi Emergency Squad. The conference also highlighted inspiring stories from students of JNF’s Alexander Muss High School in Israel. They shared how their time at the school deepened their understanding of Judaism and strengthened their connection to the land and people of Israel. In a time of rising antisemitism worldwide, including in the United States, these young leaders expressed pride in their Jewish identity and a renewed commitment to their heritage. 'Hasbara is more important now than ever. Everyone needs to use their voice. Every person who can, should speak up,' said social media influencer Emily Austin. The conference included a powerful performance by the Special in Uniform Band, earning a tearful standing ovation from the audience. Meanwhile, in the hallways, leaders held meetings to forge business deals and strengthen the Israel-U.S. connection. 'I came to call on all businessmen here in the United States, come and invest in Israel,' said Avi Bleshnikov, Israeli representative of Ron Lauder. 'This is the right time to come and build your future in Israel.' Zaluda added, 'The work continues to be urgent. It may not be emergent, but it continues to be urgent.' Outside the conference venue, demonstrators expressing opposition to the war and the State of Israel staged a Palestinian solidarity protest, including a street sit-in that led to several arrests. Despite the disruption, the conference continued undeterred, with attendees united in a spirit of strength and optimism for the future. 'It’s been an enormously roller coaster year,' said JNF-USA CEO Russel Robinson. 'The good, the bad, the ugly, the pain, the tears, the happiness. And sometimes it is so easy to get caught up in the oy vey. This gives us an opportunity to say, ‘wow, we are winning.’'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk00srdhzjg	2024-11-21T00:01:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/21/B1q6IuhGJl/B1q6IuhGJl_0_0_552_311_0_small.jpg
Report: Israeli strike hits Syrian army, pro-Iran militias, killi...	Opposition watchdog claims pro-Iranian militia sites and Syrian military positions targeted, leaving dozens of Syrian militia operatives, foreign fighters and Hezbollah members, including high-profile figures, dead and wounded Dozens were killed and injured in an Israeli airstrike targeting the city of Palmyra in Syria’s eastern desert on Wednesday, Syrian state media and opposition monitors reported. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attacks. Among the dead were 10 Syrian soldiers, with significant damage to buildings and surrounding areas, according to the Syrian Defense Ministry. The ministry alleged the strike was launched from the vicinity of the U.S. military base at Al-Tanf, near the Syria-Jordan-Iraq tri-border area, and claimed the attack targeted multiple sites in Palmyra. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, reported Thursday that at least 68 people were killed and 50 injured. Among the dead were 42 Syrians linked to pro-Iranian militias, 22 foreign nationals—primarily members of the Iraqi pro-Iranian Nujaba militia—and four Hezbollah operatives. According to the watchdog, the strikes hit three separate locations in Palmyra, including two in the Al-Jam’iya neighborhood, one of which was a weapons depot near an industrial zone. The third site allegedly hosted a meeting of pro-Iranian militia leaders, including senior figures from the Iraqi Nujaba militia and Hezbollah. Families of pro-Iranian operatives, many with Iraqi or foreign citizenship, reportedly reside in the affected area. The Observatory also noted that some of the buildings targeted were located near Palmyra’s famed archaeological sites, although the extent of any impact on the historical landmarks remains unclear. The strikes reportedly began around 1 p.m. local time, with Syrian media outlets reporting explosions in Palmyra, located in the eastern countryside of Homs province. Subsequent reports, including from the Syrian state news agency SANA, indicated strikes on residential buildings and industrial zones in and around the city. Pro-Iranian militia headquarters were also reportedly among the targets.

In subsequent clashes, six additional armed terrorists were killed. Forces also destroyed four bomb-making labs and dozens of explosive devices planted under roadways, according to the IDF.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk2bavnz1l	2024-11-20T23:21:07-08:00	
Russia launches intercontinental ballistic missile in attack on U...	Russia launched an intercontinental ballistic missile from its southern Astrakhan region during a morning attack on Ukraine on Thursday, Kyiv's air force said, the first time Russia has used such a powerful, long-range missile during the war. The strike comes after Ukraine used U.S. and British missiles to strike targets inside Russia this week, something Moscow had warned for months would be seen as a major escalation. The Russian attack targeted enterprises and critical infrastructure in the central-eastern city of Dnipro, the air force said, at a time of escalating moves in the 33-month-old war launched by Russia in Ukraine. It was unclear from the statement what the intercontinental ballistic missile targeted and whether it caused any damage. The missiles have a range of thousands of kilometers and can be used for delivering nuclear warheads, though they can also have conventional warheads. Ukrainian air defenses shot down six Kh-101 cruise missiles during the attack.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryi53v2f1g	2024-11-20T23:18:31-08:00

Bitcoin's march toward $100,000 made further ground on Thursday as investors bet a friendlier U.S. regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies under President-elect Donald Trump will unleash a boom era for the asset class. Bitcoin prices topped $97,000 for the first time in Asia trade, touching a high just above $97,559. The cryptocurrency's price has more than doubled this year and is up about 40% in the two weeks since Trump was voted in as the next U.S. president and a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers were elected to Congress. 'While it's now firmly into overbought territory, it is being drawn toward the $100k level,' said IG Markets analyst Tony Sycamore. Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the 'crypto capital of the planet' and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjmz3d2mkx	2024-11-20T23:16:50-08:00	
Three Palestinians indicted for Hamas plot to assassinate Ben-Gvi...	According to charges, ringleader conducted surveillance on police minister and his son, monitoring their travel routes, vehicles and security arrangements and considered attacking Ben-Gvir upon his arrival at terror scene Three Palestinian residents of the West Bank city of Hebron have been indicted for forming a terror cell to assassinate National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and his eldest son Shuvael, Israeli police announced Thursday. Following a joint investigation by the police and Shin Bet, authorities said they gathered evidence implicating the suspects in the plot. The indictment, submitted to a military court this week, alleges that in June 2024, the primary suspect, Ismail Ibrahim Awadi, sought to establish a cell to acquire weapons and manufacture explosives targeting security forces and senior officials. Awadi reportedly approached Hamas and Hezbollah for funding and training to carry out attacks against Israelis, including prominent figures. According to the indictment, Awadi conducted surveillance on Ben-Gvir and his son, monitoring their travel routes, vehicles and security arrangements. One scenario considered was attacking Ben-Gvir upon his arrival at a terror scene, a routine part of his ministerial duties. The suspects were apprehended earlier this year, and the arresting investigators received commendation from Judea and Samaria District Commander Moshe Pinchi. 'This case exemplifies the extensive efforts of Israel’s enemies to conduct terror operations, targeting a senior minister, his son, security forces and other officials. Arresting and indicting this terror cell represents a significant achievement in the fight against terror and efforts to protect public safety,' said Pinchi. Minister Ben-Gvir expressed gratitude to law enforcement and Shin Bet for foiling the plot. 'I thank the police and Shin Bet for arresting and indicting the terror cell that sought to assassinate me and my son. Thanks to their hard work, and by the grace of God, the enemy’s plan was thwarted,' he said.

US Senate overwhelmingly rejects Sanders' proposals to halt arms ...	Three proposals by progerssive lawmaker rejected with bipartisan opposition and backing from Biden administration; while Sanders argues aid violated US laws on human rights, opponents emphasize timing, given Israel’s threats from Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran The U.S. Senate decisively rejected overnight Thursday three proposals introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders, a progressive leader within the Democratic Party and outspoken critic of Israel, to halt arms transfers to Israel amid its war in Gaza. The first proposal, which sought to block the transfer of tank shells to Israel, failed with 79 senators opposing and 18 supporting. The second, to stop the delivery of mortar shells, was rejected by a vote of 78-10. The third, aimed at halting the transfer of Boeing's JDAM kits, which convert unguided bombs into precision-guided munitions, was defeated 80-17. All senators voting in favor were Democrats, while members from both parties opposed the measures. The Biden administration also came out against the proposals, sending a letter to Democratic senators ahead of the vote. 'Providing military equipment to Israel is an investment in its long-term security as it faces threats from Iran and elsewhere,' the administration wrote, adding that it is 'working continuously to improve conditions in Gaza.' Sanders introduced six resolutions in total, seeking to block approximately $20 billion in U.S. arms transfers to Israel, but only three were brought to a vote. For decades, strong bipartisan support for Israel in Congress has made it nearly impossible for proposals like those introduced by Sen. Sanders to pass. Still, supporters of the measures hoped a significant showing in the Senate would pressure the Israeli government and the Biden administration to take greater steps to prevent harm to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Ahead of the vote, Sanders argued that U.S. military aid to Israel violates American law prohibiting arms sales to those who commit human rights abuses. He cited the high number of child fatalities in Gaza and accused Israel of blocking humanitarian aid deliveries to the territory. 'It’s time to tell the Netanyahu government that it cannot use American taxpayer dollars and American weapons to violate U.S. and international law and our moral values,' Sanders said. Opponents of the proposals argued that they were poorly timed, as Israel faces threats from Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran. 'Israel is surrounded by enemies dedicated to its destruction,' Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish, said before the votes. Last month, the Biden administration issued an ultimatum to Israel, warning that failure to increase the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza within 30 days could result in a U.S. arms embargo. Last week, at the end of the deadline, Washington announced it had determined that Israel had 'made progress' and was no longer obstructing aid deliveries to the territory. Under U.S. law, Congress has the authority to block major arms sales to foreign countries by passing resolutions like those introduced by Sen. Sanders. Although no such resolution has ever passed Congress and survived a presidential veto, the law requires the Senate to vote on any submitted resolution. Sanders, a prominent figure on the global stage since his surprising performance in the 2016 presidential primaries, is widely credited with forcing Hillary Clinton into a grueling, extended race that some believe contributed to her eventual loss to Donald Trump. An independent rather than a Democrat, Sanders is considered a trailblazer for bringing the progressive wing to the forefront of U.S. politics, garnering widespread support among younger voters. In his youth, Sanders spent time volunteering on Kibbutz Sha'ar HaAmakim in Israel but has since become a vocal critic of Israeli policies.

UK police arrest pro-Palestinian activists over vandalism at Isra...	British police said on Thursday they arrested 10 pro-Palestinian activists from the group Palestine Action on suspicion of vandalizing the offices of Israeli defense company Elbit Systems in Bristol, southwest England. The incident occurred in early August when the activists allegedly broke into the company’s secured production facility armed with axes and hammers, damaging weapons and other equipment. Footage released by the group shows the activists causing property damage and attacking employees who tried to intervene. One worker was reportedly struck on the head. Police officers responding to the scene were also assaulted with hammers. Six suspects were arrested on-site, while others fled. Authorities continued their investigation, leading to the recent arrests.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1sk6inm1l	2024-11-20T22:11:38-08:00

IDF identifies Golani soldier killed in Lebanon clash alongside f...	Sergeant Gur Kehati of 13th Battalion, 20, from Nir Banim, killed in Hezbollah ambush alongside Ze’ev 'Jabo' Erlich, 70; 2 officers sustain moderate and severe injuries in incident The IDF identified on Thursday morning Sergeant Gur Kehati, 20, from Nir Banim, as one of two people killed in a clash with Hezbollah terrorists at an archaeological fortress in southern Lebanon. Kehati, a soldier in the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion, died alongside Ze’ev 'Jabo' Erlich, a 70-year-old historian and geographer known for his research on the Land of Israel. The incident also left a 13th Battalion officer seriously wounded and Golani Brigade Chief of Staff Col. (res.) Yoav Yarom moderately wounded. Yarom, who lost a leg in combat in Lebanon as a young officer, was present at the site, which lies 5-6 kilometers from the border and overlooks Tyre and Lebanon’s coastal plain. The clash occurred Wednesday afternoon in an area under IDF control since earlier operations, according to the military. Yarom and Erlich, armed and wearing protective gear but classified by the IDF as a civilian, were reportedly surveying the fortress near a mosque when two Hezbollah terrorists, who had been hiding there for days, opened fire at close range. The IDF said that Erlich’s presence at the site violated military orders and classified the event as a 'serious and unusual incident.' The military has launched an investigation into the circumstances of Erlich’s entry into Lebanon and his involvement in the operation. Erlich’s family disputes the IDF’s claim that he entered Lebanon as a civilian. 'Contrary to the IDF spokesperson’s claims, we clarify that Jabo was enlisted and treated in the field as a soldier,' his brother, Yigal Amitai, told Ynet. 'He was fully recognized as a soldier, entering Lebanon with the IDF’s approval and accompaniment, albeit for archaeological research, as he always did in Judea and Samaria.' Erlich was a prominent figure in Israeli historical and geographical research, particularly in Judea and Samaria, the biblical names for the different regions of the West Bank. He authored several publications, including Samaria and Benjamin and Judea and Samaria Studies, and was one of the founders of the settlement of Ofra. He is survived by his wife, Tamar, six children and grandchildren.

Family of Israeli scholar killed in Lebanon disputes IDF’s accoun...	Family of Ze’ev ‘Jabo’ Erlich, renowned historian killed in Hezbollah ambush, disputes IDF claim he entered as a civilian, asserting he was formally enlisted and had military approval for his entry; 'Instead of mourning, I’m busy correcting the damage caused by the IDF spokesperson tarnishing his name,' brother says The death of Ze’ev 'Jabo' Erlich, a 70-year-old historian and geographer from Ofra, in a clash with Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon on Wednesday shocked his family and friends. Known for his deep love of exploring every corner of Israel, Erlich, who held the rank of major in the reserves but was present as a civilian, was posthumously recognized as a fallen IDF soldier following the highly unusual incident, which also claimed the life of a Golani Brigade soldier whose name has not yet been released. While the IDF claimed that Erlich entered Lebanon as a civilian, his brother Yigal Amitai disputed this claim. 'Contrary to the IDF spokesperson’s claims, we clarify that Jabo was enlisted and treated in the field as a soldier,' Amitai told Ynet. 'He was fully recognized as a soldier, entering Lebanon with the IDF’s approval and accompaniment, albeit for archaeological research, as he always did in Judea and Samaria.' Amitai said he last spoke with Erlich on Wednesday morning before his entry into Lebanon. 'At 11 a.m., he told me, ‘We’re going into Lebanon.’ The IDF spokesperson is shielding senior officers while shifting blame onto mid-level ranks,' Amitai added. Amitai expressed frustration with how the family was informed. 'We were only notified at 8 p.m. today. Jabo was my eldest brother, one of three siblings. Instead of mourning, I’m busy correcting the damage caused by the IDF spokesperson tarnishing his name,' he said. The IDF acknowledged Erlich’s years of service as a reserve major and decided to grant him a military burial. Erlich, one of the founding figures of the Ofra settlement, was a prominent historian and editor of influential publications such as Samaria and Benjamin and Judea and Samaria Studies. He is survived by his wife Tamar, six children and grandchildren. 'There was nothing Jabo didn’t know about the history and archaeology of Israel,' Amitai said. 'He didn’t just teach knowledge—he conveyed the emotion and depth behind every story. He lived with a profound historical consciousness. We are in complete shock and still processing this heavy loss.' 'This is a tremendous shock. Jabo was a scholar of the Land of Israel who explored every corner,' Pinchas Wallerstein, a close friend of Erlich, told Ynet. 'His knowledge of the country’s history was astounding. We’ve known each other for over 50 years. He guided tours not only in Israel but also in Jordan and other locations. He was a classic figure, deeply familiar with the land and widely respected across all segments of society. He had connections with every senior IDF officer—there isn’t a general who didn’t know Jabo.' Wallerstein added, 'I’m still struggling to process this news. We climbed together last Friday, and he told me he was preparing to enter Lebanon, speaking about some fortress he was surveying. He was part of the founding team that established the Field School in Ofra. I truly cannot comprehend this loss. Jabo was a Renaissance man—there was almost no topic related to the Land of Israel he didn’t know. And it’s important to note that he loved the people of Israel in all their diversity.' Erlich moved to Ofra in 1977, where he worked as a guide for five years at the Field School. It was there that he met his wife, Tamar, who worked as the school’s secretary. The couple was among the first 50 families to build permanent homes in the settlement. He earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Jewish history and Talmudic studies but was also known for his extensive self-directed learning. Erlich’s passion was the Land of Israel and its people. He frequently traveled throughout the country, focusing particularly on remote and unconventional locations in Judea and Samaria, and often wrote articles about his explorations. Yaron Rosenthal, head of the Gush Etzion Regional Council and a friend of Erlich, told Ynet: 'It’s hard to fathom the immense tragedy of losing our dear friend Ze’ev ‘Jabo’ Erlich. Jabo was one of the founding figures in the field of tour guiding and the study of Judea and Samaria. Our generation followed his lead, hanging on his every word. For years, he guided and researched with unparalleled curiosity, exploring every nook and cranny and investigating every archaeological site. Few people had such a profound passion for the land and loved it as deeply as he did. To me, Jabo was also a dear friend and a mentor from whom I learned so much over the years. I will miss him deeply. We will do our best to follow in the footsteps of the giant he was.' Nati Malihi, a close friend of Erlich, paid tribute, writing: 'The man, the mustache, the Bible and the Land of Israel. ‘No need to stand for me,’ he would joke with a wave of his hand, smiling beneath his mustache while holding his Bible marked with hundreds of tabs, as he did every Friday evening before taking his seat two chairs ahead of mine. 'I first met him about 40 years ago when we lived on Har Bracha, Mount Gerizim. Jabo was a regular visitor, welcomed as family by our Samaritan neighbors, whom he studied, knew, loved and shared their secrets with us. Jabo and the Land of Israel. Jabo and the Bible that lived within him. You’d ask him a question and receive a scholarly answer, always with a wink. ‘You can sit down now,’ he would say to all of us. ‘I’m on duty for the study of the Land of Israel.’ May his memory be a blessing.' Moshe Gutman, chairman of the 'Preserving Eternity' coalition for protecting heritage sites in Judea and Samaria, said: '‘Jabo’ was synonymous with knowledge of the land, for hikes through every valley and ruin—a figure worthy of admiration. He was the guide of guides, the teacher of teachers, a legendary man. He loved heritage with all his heart. Wherever you found him, he was immersed in the story of the place—explaining, narrating, questioning, interpreting, connecting and inspiring thought. He was a soldier of heritage, a true Renaissance man, a man of the land. His legacy will forever walk with us, through the trails and sites, the mountains and valleys. Jabo was, and remains, a legend.' Yisrael Ganz, head of the Benjamin Regional Council, said: 'We are shocked by the sudden loss of Jabo. His name was synonymous with knowledge and love for the land. He was a pioneer of settlement and a pillar of the Ofra community. Thousands of land enthusiasts have grown, and will continue to grow, from the discoveries and insights he brought to the world, rooted in his deep love for the Holy Land, its heritage and the history of the Jewish people within it. We share in the profound sorrow of his dear wife Tamar, the entire Erlich family and the Ofra community, embracing them in their grief.' The Yesha Council also paid tribute, describing him as 'a living legend in both life and death, with an extraordinary legacy. A scholar of the Land of Israel who knew every corner and trail. For many years, he volunteered and assisted soldiers across various sectors, sharing his unmatched knowledge of villages and sites.' In the incident where Erlich was killed, a Golani soldier also fell. The soldier’s family has been notified, but his name has not yet been released. Additionally, a soldier from the 13th Battalion was critically injured, and Golani Brigade Chief of Staff Col. (res.) Yoav Yarom sustained moderate injuries. The highly unusual incident occurred around 3 p.m. in an area 5-6 kilometers inside Lebanon, overlooking Tyre and the southern coastal plain. According to the IDF, Although Erlich, a reserve major, volunteered for military service until the age of 70, he entered Lebanon as a civilian. He joined Yarom to survey an ancient fortress near a mosque on a high ridge. Erlich was reportedly armed, wearing protective gear and dressed in military-style clothing. The IDF emphasized that the investigation into the incident is in its early stages. Among the questions being examined are reports that this was not Erlich’s first entry into southern Lebanon with IDF officers in recent weeks and whether his presence was for archaeological research or operational purposes. In an unusual decision, the IDF's new Personnel Directorate head, Maj. Gen. Dado Bar Kalifa, posthumously recognized Erlich as a fallen IDF soldier with active reserve service, granting him the right to a military burial.

Hezbollah rocket strikes northern Israel kindergarten minutes aft...	Shortly after Hezbollah chief concludes speech, terror group launches rocket barrage, striking empty kindergarten in Acre, causing significant damage to building; blast also damaged dozens of nearby homes, sparking renewed fears among residents A barrage of 25 rockets launched by Hezbollah struck the Western Galilee on Wednesday, with one rocket directly hitting the fence of a kindergarten in the coastal city of Acre. No children were present at the time of the strike, but the kindergarten sustained significant damage, and dozens of nearby buildings were also impacted by the blast. The IDF reported that only some of the rockets were intercepted by air defenses. Assi Abutbul, a 25-year-old local, described the aftermath. 'I heard a loud noise and went outside to see a hole in the kindergarten,' he said. 'There were children here this morning. This is not a good situation—not at all.' When asked about the prospects for a cease-fire, Abutbul was dismissive. 'There is no settlement, no security, nothing. It’s all lies. Missiles are hitting kindergartens and schools. There’s no security or agreements—just nonsense.' In response to the attack, the Acre municipality announced the suspension of classes citywide on Thursday and Friday. Mayor Amichai Ben-Shlush conducted a situation assessment at the site and determined that educational institutions would remain closed until at least Sunday. Further decisions will be made following a reassessment on Saturday night. In a conversation with Ynet, Mayor Amichai Ben-Shlush clarified that he does not intend to continue adhering to Home Front Command guidelines, which permit the reopening of classes and transportation. Instead, he ordered the closure of schools, kindergartens and daycares, many of which had only recently reopened for a limited number of students. For the past nine weeks, educational activities in the city have been almost entirely suspended due to the ongoing security situation. Ben-Shlush revealed that about 120 children had been enrolled in the kindergarten that was struck and noted that they had left the premises only about 35 minutes before the rocket hit, at 3:45 p.m. 'It’s a miracle. You can see the hole in the fence,' he said, pointing to the damage caused by the rocket. Ben-Shlush argued that the incident reinforced his belief that fully resuming the education system should be avoided and done 'patiently' and gradually, even if the Home Front Command does not impose restrictions. 'I will act according to my instincts for the safety and security of Acre’s children,' he vowed. The mayor also criticized the government’s handling of the situation. 'The education minister visited the city today and toured with me. I told him again that many educational institutions still lack safe zones,' Ben-Shlush said. 'I described the reality of dozens of schools without protected areas that I cannot safely reopen. Even if the children return, they will fear coming to schools because of the lack of shelter. The older schools are like cardboard. We’ve had a few miracles already, and this was another one. I’m calling on the Israeli government to help us—don’t forsake us.' The barrage was fired immediately after Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem delivered a speech in which he declared that the terrorist organization would continue attacking Israel until a cease-fire agreement is reached. He threatened to target Tel Aviv and central Israel in retaliation for Israeli strikes in Beirut, which have significantly escalated in recent days amid ongoing negotiations. 'We will not leave the capital under fire from the Israeli enemy. When Beirut is under attack by the enemy, the response must target the center of Tel Aviv,' he said, seemingly referring to Tel Aviv as Israel’s capital. 'The enemy must understand that things will not remain as they are when it attacks Beirut.' In his remarks, Qassem addressed the negotiation efforts with Israel, stating that Hezbollah has submitted its comments on the American-brokered proposal and is now awaiting Israel's response. 'The success of the negotiations depends on the Israeli response and Netanyahu's seriousness,' he asserted. He outlined two conditions, which he referred to as 'limits' for the negotiations: a complete halt to what he called 'Israeli aggression' and the preservation of Lebanon's sovereignty. The latter is likely a reference to a contentious clause permitting Israeli freedom of action in response to violations of the agreement. U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Israel on Wednesday evening after visiting Beirut, where he received Hezbollah’s response to an American-brokered cease-fire proposal. Hochstein described the negotiations as having made 'positive progress' and is set to meet shortly with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a close confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Talks will continue Thursday, with Israel’s Security Cabinet convening in the evening for a briefing on the developments. Senior diplomats said an agreement is 'closer than ever,' with 90-95% of the details finalized, but warned that 'the devil is in the details.' They noted that sensitive issues, including the establishment of a monitoring mechanism, remain unresolved. 'There appears to be shared interest in reaching a deal, but key decisions must still be made,' one diplomat said. The proposed monitoring framework would involve significant roles for the U.S., France and Britain, aimed at bolstering the Lebanese Armed Forces through arms and advisory support. Military cooperation from Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates is also expected to play a role in strengthening Lebanon’s military capabilities. Meanwhile, the IDF continues its operations in Lebanon, with the military reporting significant strikes against Hezbollah operatives and infrastructure. On Wednesday, the IDF announced that Israeli Air Force fighter jets had killed Hezbollah’s operations commander and the commander of its anti-tank missile array in a strike on Sunday. According to the military, the two were responsible for multiple attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers, including anti-tank missile strikes on the Western Galilee and central Israel. The IDF said that their elimination deals a significant blow to Hezbollah’s operational capabilities. In southern Lebanon, IDF forces uncovered ammunition depots and seized caches of weapons and equipment during ongoing ground operations. Over the past 24 hours, the Air Force struck more than 100 Hezbollah targets, including rocket launchers, weapons warehouses, command centers and operational buildings, the IDF said.

Civilian, 71, joined IDF forces in Lebanon, killed by Hezbollah	Renowned historian and geographer Ze'ev H. Erlich reportedly entered Lebanon in violation of operational orders and ambushed by terrorists while surveying ancient fortress in Tyre sector Ze’ev H. Erlich, a 71-year-old Israeli historian and geographer, was killed Wednesday by Hezbollah gunfire while accompanying Israeli forces in southern Lebanon. The incident, described by the military as 'serious and unusual,' occurred around 3 p.m. in an operational zone roughly 5-6 kilometers from the border, overlooking Tyre and Lebanon’s southern coastal plain. The IDF said Erlich, a civilian armed with a personal weapon and wearing military attire and protective gear, was present in the area alongside Col. Yoav Yarom, chief of staff of the Golani Brigade. Yarom, a veteran who lost a leg in combat in Lebanon years earlier, was visiting a site where an Israeli soldier had been killed earlier in the week. The area has been under IDF operational control since. The pair began surveying an ancient fortress near a mosque situated on a high ridge when two Hezbollah operatives, who had reportedly been hiding in the sector for days, opened fire at close range, fatally striking Erlich. The IDF said the circumstances of his presence in the area are under investigation, including whether he was there for archaeological purposes or part of an operational mission.

Israeli national detained in Greece reports severe abuse by Musli...	Man, suffering from advanced liver condition, claims enduring beatings, death threats and antisemitic harassment in prison; 'They tell him all Jews must be killed; I’m afraid he won’t survive this,' wife says An Israeli man arrested in Greece last month on a German extradition warrant has reported severe abuse by Muslim inmates while awaiting a court decision. His wife claims he has been targeted for being Jewish, enduring beatings, death threats and antisemitic harassment in prison. 'They tell him all Jews must be killed, and he’s in terrible fear,' she said. 'I fear for his life. He calls me crying every day, saying he’s being beaten and threatened. He is terrified and can’t sleep.' She added that her husband hasn’t eaten because authorities won’t allow him kosher food. 'My husband is sick, with 75% disability, and I’m afraid he won’t survive this,' she added. 'The Foreign Ministry and the embassy in Greece are not helping at all. They haven’t even visited him — I haven’t received a single phone call. We’re so disappointed in Israel for not offering help. 'He won’t survive there. He’s begging to be released, saying they hate Jews. There is severe antisemitism there.' The couple has three children, who have not been attending school since the incident. 'We’re in a financial and emotional crisis,' she said. The 42-year-old man from Rehovot, who suffers from advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, was arrested in October while vacationing on the Greek island of Rhodes. Germany has accused him of participating in a €300,000 fraud scheme, a charge that could carry a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence if convicted. Initially hospitalized due to his health condition, the man was briefly granted bail but was returned to custody after collapsing in court. He is currently detained in Athens, awaiting an appeal on the extradition decision. The man’s attorney, Mordechai Tzivin, wrote to the Foreign Ministry urging immediate intervention, citing his client’s critical health and the alleged mistreatment by Muslim inmates. 'He is being harassed, denied food and constantly threatened,' Tzivin said. 'He is so desperate he has expressed suicidal thoughts to his wife.' The Foreign Ministry has not yet commented on the case.

Devil’s in the details': Lebanon cease-fire agreement near, dipl...	Sources say '90-95%' of agreement finalized but key details, including monitoring mechanism, unresolved; Hezbollah chief confirms terror group submitted response to US proposal, warning deal hinges on Israel halting 'aggression' and respecting Lebanon’s sovereignty U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Israel on Wednesday evening after visiting Beirut, where he received Hezbollah’s response to an American-brokered cease-fire proposal. Hochstein described the negotiations as having made 'positive progress' and is set to meet shortly with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a close confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Talks will continue Thursday, with Israel’s Security Cabinet convening in the evening for a briefing on the developments. Senior diplomats said an agreement is 'closer than ever,' with 90-95% of the details finalized, but warned that 'the devil is in the details.' They noted that sensitive issues, including the establishment of a monitoring mechanism, remain unresolved. 'There appears to be shared interest in reaching a deal, but key decisions must still be made,' one diplomat said. The proposed monitoring framework would involve significant roles for the U.S., France and Britain, aimed at bolstering the Lebanese Armed Forces through arms and advisory support. Military cooperation from Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates is also expected to play a role in strengthening Lebanon’s military capabilities. Hezbollah’s newly appointed leader, Naim Qassem, who assumed the role last month following the assassinations of Hassan Nasrallah and his original successor-designate Hashem Safieddine, delivered a speech Wednesday afternoon addressing ongoing negotiations with Israel. Amid threats issued during his remarks, Qassem confirmed that Hezbollah had submitted its comments on the U.S.-brokered proposal and is now awaiting Israel’s response. 'The success of the negotiations depends on Israel’s response and Netanyahu’s seriousness,' Qassem said. He emphasized two key conditions, which he referred to as the 'red lines' for the talks: a complete halt to what he called 'Israeli aggression' and the preservation of Lebanon’s sovereignty—likely referencing disputes over Israel’s demand for freedom of action in the event of violations of the agreement.

According to officials, decisions on key issues, including a monitoring mechanism, are pending. While there appears to be shared interest in reaching a deal, disputes remain. The agreement is expected to involve significant U.S., French and British support for Lebanon’s military, including arms and advisory aid, as well as contributions from the armed forces of Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rklaxqjg1x	2024-11-20T07:57:31-08:00	
5th grader left outside shelter amid Hezbollah rocket attack in c...	Kfar Saba grade school student left crying and frightened outside shelter during rocket sirens after staff refused to reopen door; child was in the bathroom when the alert sounded and unable to reach shelter in time; Education Ministry: 'serious lapse in judgment' A 5th-grade student at Yitzhak Sadeh Elementary School in the central city of Kfar Saba was left outside a shelter during a Hezbollah rocket attack on Tuesday, sparking outrage from parents and prompting an apology from the Education Ministry According to parents, the student was delayed in reaching the shelter because he was in the bathroom when the sirens sounded. By the time he arrived, the door had already been closed. Educational staff reportedly refused to reopen it, citing safety procedures meant to protect those already inside in the event of a direct hit. The child was instructed to lie on the ground and cover his head as his classmates pleaded for him to be let in. 'His friends begged for him, but he was left crying outside the shelter,' parents said. 'The child is traumatized, and so are his friends and us.' A mother of another student at the school called the decision 'a terrible blunder,' questioning the protocols used. 'They claimed these are the procedures, but who set them? The child was just a minute late—he was right by the shelter. How can you leave him outside?' she said. The Education Ministry condemned the handling of the incident, calling it a 'serious lapse in judgment.' In a statement, the ministry emphasized that no child should ever be left out of a shelter during an emergency. 'We will review the incident and immediately refresh emergency procedures to ensure this does not happen again,' the statement read. Parents expressed ongoing concern over the incident, with one mother saying she now feels anxious about sending her daughter to school. 'These are little kids. They’re already dealing with daily anxiety from everything going on, and now this? If it were their child, would they leave them outside?'

US vetoes UN Security Council cease-fire resolution on Gaza	Washington rejects truce without release of hostages, including 7 Americans, emphasizing, 'Hamas, not Israel, obstructing deal'; Israeli envoy praises move, condemning resolution as enabling terrorism and reaffirming Israel’s stance against cease-fire without hostage release The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza without conditions, including the release of hostages held by Hamas. The resolution was supported by 14 council members, leaving the U.S. as the sole opponent. The U.S. representative cited the ongoing captivity of seven American citizens among the hostages held by Hamas. 'Hamas, not Israel, is obstructing a deal that could include a temporary cease-fire,' the envoy said. Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon praised the U.S. for its stance, reiterating that no cease-fire would occur without the release of hostages. 'Today, we prevented a disgraceful attempt by the UN to abandon our captives. Thanks to the U.S., we upheld the critical principle: the hostages must be freed. We will continue fighting until all of them are home,' Danon said. Danon also criticized the 14 council members who supported the resolution, accusing them of enabling terrorism. 'You have reached a new low. You failed to uphold justice and peace, abandoning your basic responsibility to those who need you most. This resolution supported Hamas' terror,' he said. The vote came a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz visited the Netzarim Corridor in Gaza. Netanyahu vowed that 'Hamas will no longer rule Gaza' and urged Gaza residents to help locate hostages, offering a $5 million reward for information leading to their recovery. A senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity ahead of the vote, said the U.S. would only support a resolution that explicitly calls for the immediate release of hostages as part of a cease-fire. 'As we stated many times before, we just can't support an unconditional cease-fire that does not call for the immediate release of hostages,' the official said.

US vetoes UN Security Council resolution on Gaza cease-fire	The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council resolution for a cease-fire in Israel's war in Gaza, accusing council members of cynically rejecting attempts at reaching a compromise. The 15-member council voted on a resolution put forward by its 10 non-permanent members in a meeting that called for an 'immediate, unconditional and permanent cease-fire' and separately demanded the release of hostages. Only the U.S. voted against, using its veto as a permanent council member to block the resolution. A senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity ahead of the vote, said the U.S. would only support a resolution that explicitly calls for the immediate release of hostages as part of a cease-fire.

US envoy heads to Israel as Lebanon talks show promise, but chall...	Following progress in Beirut talks, Amos Hochstein set to arrive in Israel overnight; Jerusalem officials express cautious optimism but acknowledge remaining gaps, particularly over monitoring mechanism White House special envoy Amos Hochstein, who has been in Beirut for several days mediating talks between Israel and Hezbollah, is expected to arrive in Israel overnight Thursday to present Lebanon and Hezbollah’s responses to a proposed U.S.-drafted de-escalation agreement. Following his meeting with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who is leading the talks on Hezbollah’s behalf, Hochstein described the talks as 'very constructive and very helpful' and said that the parties 'have continued to narrow the gaps.' Israeli officials believe Hochstein will push Lebanon to compromise on key issues, particularly regarding the mechanism for monitoring the enforcement of the agreement. Lebanon reportedly opposes the inclusion of Britain and Germany in the deal, preferring Arab nations such as Egypt and Jordan, while Israel insists on a framework led by a U.S. CENTCOM general. Lebanese and Arab media, including outlets affiliated with Hezbollah, widely covered the ongoing negotiations. While most reported significant progress, they acknowledged unresolved issues. Sky News Arabia cited sources close to Berri who claimed that 'nearly 80% of the cease-fire agreement has been finalized.' The pro-Hezbollah newspaper Al-Akhbar reported that there is 'understanding on all draft clauses,' but noted that discussions now focus on border-related issues, which remain shrouded in secrecy. Israel is cautiously optimistic ahead of Hochstein’s upcoming meetings in Israel on Thursday. Meanwhile, Defense Minister Israel Katz visited a military intelligence base in central Israel, emphasizing that 'the prerequisite for any political agreement in Lebanon is preserving intelligence capabilities and ensuring the IDF's right to operate and defend Israeli citizens against Hezbollah.' This point—freedom of operation—has been a significant sticking point during the negotiations. Mahmoud Kamati, deputy head of Hezbollah's political council, said that any cease-fire agreement 'must end the war quickly' while preserving Lebanon’s sovereignty. In an interview with Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Manar TV, Kamati said he was 'neither very optimistic nor very pessimistic' about the prospects for an agreement. Similarly, senior Hezbollah official Hassan Fadlallah told Lebanon’s Al-Jadeed TV, 'No one in Lebanon accepts a breach of its sovereignty or granting freedom of movement to the enemy. The war will not end on the enemy’s terms.' The draft agreement reportedly includes a 60-day cease-fire trial period during which Hezbollah would withdraw beyond the Litani River, leaving only the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL forces in southern Lebanon. If the cease-fire holds, the IDF would then withdraw from southern Lebanon. Despite broad agreement on many clauses, two key issues remain unresolved: the IDF’s freedom of operation and the composition of the monitoring committee overseeing the implementation of UN Resolution 1701. According to Lebanese sources cited by Sky News Arabia, a revised clause was agreed upon during Hochstein's visit to Beirut, stating that 'each side has the right to self-defense if attacked, provided that the U.S. ensures Israel does not conduct preemptive strikes.' If the parties reach an agreement, Washington is expected to announce the start of the cease-fire, marking the beginning of the implementation phase. This would test whether Hezbollah retreats beyond the Litani and if the Lebanese Army takes over southern Lebanon. During this period, the IDF will remain in the south of the country, though adjustments to its operational deployment are expected. Ultimately, the plan envisions only the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL forces remaining in southern Lebanon. The cease-fire announcement may also involve French participation, acting as a guarantor for Lebanon. In 2006, a similar cease-fire agreement was reached, but its enforcement mechanism collapsed on the ground. This time, however, a more robust mechanism involving the UK, Germany, France and others has been devised. Israel has retained the right, under the agreement, to enforce the cease-fire and maintain operational freedom if violations occur.

Bitcoin rises above $94,000 for the first time	Bitcoin rose to a record high above $94,000 as a report that Donald Trump's social media company was in talks to buy crypto trading firm Bakkt boosted expectations of a crypto-friendly regime under his incoming administration. Bitcoin, the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, has more than doubled this year. It was last at $93,521 on Wednesday, having hit a high of $94,078 in early Asian trading hours. The Financial Times said Trump Media and Technology Group , which operates Truth Social, is close to an all-stock acquisition of Bakkt, which is backed by NYSE-owner Intercontinental Exchange. 'Trump's seeming interest to push further into crypto on a personal level has contributed to optimism that crypto will be a top priority when Trump takes office,' said Stephane Ouellette, chief executive officer of crypto trading firm FRNT Financial. Cryptocurrencies have soared since the Nov. 5 U.S. election as traders bet President-elect Trump's promised support for digital assets would lead to a less restrictive regulatory regime.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1n0tusgkg	2024-11-20T04:02:58-08:00

Paying the ultimate price: 800 IDF soldiers have fallen since Oct...	The war's relentless toll on Israel echoes through its fallen troops, with 800 soldiers killed since Hamas' surprise attack, marking a loss unseen since the Yom Kippur War; These are the numbers behind Israel's staggering losses Since the unexpected assault by Hamas on October 7, 2023, the toll on IDF has been profound, with 800 soldiers giving their lives to protect the nation. Among them, 757 men and 43 women have fallen, including 28 during the ongoing operation in the northern Gaza Strip, especially around Jabaliya. This staggering loss is something Israel and IDF have not confronted in over 51 years, not since the Yom Kippur War. Valiant troops have fallen every single month since the start of the war. October 2023 stands out as the bloodiest month, with 342 casualties, most of whom died on that horrific Saturday, saving countless lives and preventing Hamas terrorists from advancing deeper into Israel. In the months that followed, as the IDF has engaged in ground maneuvers in the Gaza Strip and later in Lebanon, there have been notable military achievements that will be discussed for years to come, but the cost is heavy. In December alone, 110 soldiers were killed. This October, marking a year of war, was dubbed 'Black October,' with 62 soldiers falling in combat. The current conflict is being waged on multiple fronts: The southern front since October 26, 2023, the northern front where ground maneuvers began on September 30, 2024, and ongoing security fronts, primarily in the West Bank. In the Gaza Strip, 375 soldiers, including one female soldier, have fallen since operations began, 44 in Lebanon, and 11 in the West Bank. There have also been losses on the northern front, primarily due to drone and missile attacks launched by Hezbollah from Lebanon. In this war, 272 reserve soldiers have fallen in battle. Much has been said about the mobilization of the reserves, a scale unseen since the establishment of the state. Many understood the significance of the moment on the morning of October 7 and reported for duty – many without having received call-up orders, and some beyond the age of exemption – leaving behind families, children, jobs and businesses, and paying — and still paying — an unbearable emotional and familial price. Additionally, 143 career soldiers have fallen. The rest are conscripted troops, young people under 22 who hadn't yet begun their lives, with dreams, plans and aspirations abruptly cut short. The fallen have left behind 181 widows, most of whom are mothers, including 27 women who were pregnant when their partners died. The grim statistics include 44 families suffering multiple losses, who have faced the dreadful knock on their door more than once, including siblings who became bereaved parents, bereaved fathers who are also bereaved uncles, grandparents who buried more than one grandchild, and other heart-wrenching cases. Furthermore, the 'Left Behind a Friend' organization reported that there are 327 bereaved partners since the war began. IDF commanders have been leading from the front since the fighting started, guiding soldiers to operational achievements across all fronts. When the ethos of 'Follow Me' becomes a reality, the human cost is significant. About a quarter of all casualties are officers. In the current war, the IDF has lost 69 platoon leaders, 20 deputy company commanders, 63 company commanders, seven deputy battalion commanders, five battalion commanders, and four brigade commanders. The IDF website has published the dates of death for all the soldiers, except for four – Sergeant Ron Sherman, Corporal Nick Beiser, Corporal Noa Marciano, and Master Sergeant Ori Danino. Sherman and Beiser, who were documented as being kidnapped alive, were killed in Gaza alongside Elia Toledano. Their bodies were rescued and returned by the IDF. Two months ago, the IDF determined that it is highly probable the three were killed as a 'byproduct of an IDF airstrike during the elimination of senior Hamas member Ahmed Randor on November 10, 2023.' The IDF also retrieved the body of lookout Noa Marciano, who was murdered in captivity at al-Shifa Hospital by Hamas terrorists. Danino went to enjoy the Nova Festival. He was kidnapped to Gaza and murdered in Hamas captivity along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Alex Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, and Carmel Gat. The IDF discovered their bodies in late August.

On Sunday, the Israeli Air Force eliminated the commanders of Hezbollah’s anti-tank missile and operations unit in the coastal sector, the IDF spokesman announced on Wednesday.

Additionally, IDF troops are continuing limited, localized, targeted raids in southern Lebanon to remove threats to Israeli civilians. The forces located weapons storage facilities and struck terrorist command centers and sites during joint ground and aerial activity.

IDF reservist Roi Sasson fell in Jabaliya, 2nd soldier seriously ...	Terrorists ambushed a building in the northern Gaza Strip, and the 21-year-old reservist was killed; His mother recalls their last conversation: 'I told him, get out of there. The day he entered Gaza, my heart fell'; 800 IDF soldiers have died since the start of the war Sergeant First Class (res.) Roi Sasson, 21, from Mevaseret Zion, a solder in the Nachshon Battalion of the Kfir Brigade fell Tuesday in an encounter with terrorists in Jabaliya, the IDF announced on Wednesday morning. In the same incident, the commander of the Nachshon Battalion, Kfir Brigade, Lt. Col. Yoel Glickman, was seriously injured, though his life is not in danger. Since the outbreak of the war, 800 IDF soldiers have died in battles, 28 of them in the current operation in Jabaliya. A preliminary investigation of the encounter reveals that the force under Glickman's command was ambushed by a terrorist squad that was waiting inside a building, and came at the end of the battalion's attack on a target in the seam between Beit Lahia and Jabaliya. 'Yesterday evening I was informed, it was the hardest thing I ever had to hear and experience in my life from the moment my son entered Gaza, and he has been a soldier for three years. That's four months of reserve that they added to the three years,' Osnat Gal, Roi's mother told Ynet. 'He was a class commander, in Lebanon he replaced a soldier who had to leave for medical reasons. There was no manpower. He was in charge of many soldiers, and fulfilled the position with distinction.' 'Then he moved to the West Bank and he was there in several places. The last place was Nablus. As soon as he told me he entered Gaza, my heart fell. I accompanied him to the entrance to Gaza on November 1. He entered happy, said he was privileged to contribute to the country and be there for those who need him. We spoke for the last time on Saturday, after a few very difficult days. I told him, 'If you can get out, please get out.' He didn't worry, he was happy to be there and felt that he was doing something, that he was contributing.' She added that Roi 'was a boy who, even if he was uncomfortable, would do things for others first. From the Scouts when he was a guide, to when he helped injured people. He was always giving. I lost the most precious thing in the world. He was a handsome boy, with green eyes .A boy with values. A true gentleman. Took care of others. He called his grandmother every Shabbat evening to ask how she is.' She said that Roi was expected to leave Gaza on Thursday, and to be released in three weeks. 'He went with dedication. He finished the regular service and then went to four months of reserve, which he did not survive. He loved his family, friends and fellow soldiers, and most of all he loved the country. I asked him to leave already, I couldn't handle all the 'permission to publish' notices of fallen soldiers , but my daughters told me that he was looking for another place to serve, even in other divisions, he was not afraid. He wanted to fight for his country. The 800th fallen, I'm sure it has meaning. I understood that they saw a terrorist in the house in Jabaliya, and proceeded to clear the area. I understood that he was shot and killed on the spot,' she said. On Sunday, the Nachshon Battalion lost two more soldiers who fell in the battle in Jabaliya, Captain Yogev Pazy and Staff sergeant Noam Eitan. A day before, Sergeant first class (res.) Idan Kenan Cohen from the battalion also fell in battle. Glickman, who was seriously injured in the encounter with the terrorists, was appointed to the position of battalion commander this year. When the war broke out on October 7, he was sent to the Gaza border area where he fought for many days in the kibbutzim, including Be'eri. Ten days later, his daughter was born. A day before he was seriously injured, Glickman recorded from the combat zone a eulogy for Pazy to be played at his funeral. 'We are continuing the mission,' Glickman said in the recording. 'It was important for you to always be first in every attack. You were an unconventional commander. We are in a war for Israel's existence, no less. We will continue on your way, Pazy.'

IDF establishes new defensive positions on Lebanon border as ceas...	Official cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah remains unfinalized, so the IDF is proactively setting up new outposts near the border with Lebanon, refurbishing old military positions and forming combat units to provide visible security and support for returning residents An official cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah remains elusive, yet the IDF is proactively establishing new outposts near border communities along the Lebanese border. The military is refurbishing former outposts and preparing to station combat units within communities, ensuring returning residents feel secure with a visible military presence. In recent weeks, the IDF has dismantled concrete walls and firing positions along confrontation line roads, which had become a gray fixture of the landscape. It has also withdrawn military forces from public buildings and evacuated areas, while working with local authorities to shape a new security framework. In Shlomi, situated right on the border, where over 7,000 residents were evacuated in October 2023, the local council has recently installed permanent firing and defense positions around the community facing Lebanon, ready for any alert. Additionally, a military outpost with at least a company-sized force will secure the community. This week, the Shlomi local council plans to approve three security tenders developed in anticipation of future needs. These include establishing an extensive camera network operated by a 24/7 active center, budgeting $6.6 million for a tactical combat unit patrolling around the clock with off-road vehicles, and forming a rapid response force of 60 volunteer fighters from the community. These measures have been approved by the IDF Northern Command and the Chief of Staff, according to Gabi Naaman, head of the Shlomi Council. In recent days, senior military commanders, including brigade leaders from Golani, Kfir and the 228th Brigade, have consistently urged displaced northern residents to 'return home now' through every available media platform. These military pressures, lacking clear and coordinated statements from political leaders, are viewed by many as unauthorized interference and a detriment to the war objectives expected in the north. Naaman also sought to temper the enthusiastic calls for residents to return home, emphasizing essential conditions: 'For us to return home, several critical things must happen,' he told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth. 'One is for IDF to position itself north of Shlomi, on the mountain and into the Lebanese side, to prevent any certain infiltration. We also expect soldiers to be visibly present in front of us and within Shlomi itself, not behind us. The third requirement is completing the installation of defensive technological means to create a sense of security and visibility.' Amid frantic U.S.-pressured talks to reach a settlement to end the war in Lebanon, Naaman expressed hope that the government will prioritize national interests over global ones. 'We do not trust fabricated agreements, so the IDF must maintain a security zone for at least the coming years to ensure Hezbollah does not plan another attack on northern communities. These are the minimum conditions. It's important that the IDF remains assertive and does everything to empower politicians to negotiate the best possible agreement. I trust the prime minister more than anyone else,' he said. Naaman said the IDF should drive the required strategic change, not politicians. 'The IDF is our strength and, unfortunately, also our weakness. If we end the war like a month ago, Hezbollah will only grow stronger. We don't want to beg for an agreement; we want them to be the ones begging for it,' he said. On Tuesday, Naaman, along with other local authority heads from the confrontation line, met with the new minister Ze'ev Elkin, responsible for the northern and southern administrations. Authorities have high hopes that he will succeed in rallying all government ministries to the challenge of developing the area. Naaman announced before the meeting his intention to urge Elkin to create certainty for over 60,000 northern evacuees. 'I will ask him to promote a government decision to extend the stay outside the community, as well as the benefits for residents, not just until the end of December but beyond, to provide calm for residents and ensure their return is gradual, not rushed or under distress as the evacuation was. All this, of course, on the condition the IDF provides absolute security, achieving the main objective of the war in the north and not a moment before.' Keeping a visible contact line whether an agreement is reached this week or postponed, IDF troops continue daily operations beyond the border to expose more areas and 'clean' the buffer zone, previously tangled and concealed from the army's view. In the western sector, engineering forces and the 146th Division fighters lead the 'plowing' efforts on the ground. The military warns that without daily maintenance of this line – from the sea at Rosh Hanikra to Mount Dov – to ensure it remains clear, or without physically remaining there, it will be challenging to guarantee security for residents along the border line. Already now, after heavy rains, vegetation is growing again, and must be cleared. This will likely be a sticking point with Hezbollah, which will insist on withdrawing all Israeli forces beyond the border fence, potentially creating a significant obstacle in any emerging arrangement. There is concern that the Iranian-funded terrorist organization will quickly seek to cover the area again with dense, concealing foliage. Residents can no longer agree to a demand that would return the obscured view the army suffered from before October 6, 2023. Alongside targeted raids in southern Lebanon, with relatively fewer forces than those in Lebanon in recent weeks, the IDF reports that the maneuver to thwart the northern attack plan has been completed, and forces await further instructions from the political echelon. A senior military source noted that, under current conditions, residents can begin renovating damaged homes and preparing them for their return. This is based on the assumption that, following the rocket fire pushed away from the contact line with Israel, it is safer to move around evacuated communities than it was in the past year. The IDF assesses that the current rocket threat from Hezbollah is not significantly different between many evacuated communities and cities like Nahariya, Acre, or communities adjacent to Haifa such as Kiryat Motzkin, all of which are targeted daily.

France says window of opportunity open for Lebanon cease-fire	France's foreign minister said on Wednesday that U.S.-led efforts for a truce between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon had created the chance for a lasting cease-fire and he called on both sides to accept a deal on the table. 'There is a window of opportunity that's opening for a lasting ceasefire in Lebanon that would allow the return of those displaced, ensure the sovereignty of Lebanon and the security of Israel,' Jean-Noel Barrot told Europe 1 radio.

With military outposts and tacit approval from the coalition: Thi...	Analysis: After Gallant's dismissal and in view of the new US administration, Israel is working to establish facts on the ground in order to have de facto control of the strip, but without a political decision which could involve many and weighty legal consequences; This corresponds with the settlers' plans to settle in northern Gaza; 'A historic opportunity returns' Israel appears to be on its way to realizing the idea of ​​a military administration in the Gaza Strip. In view of actions on the ground, it seems that Israel has increased its activity toward implementation of the move. Netanyahu's senior coalition members, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, have already expressed their opinion on the matter countless times, but now things seem to be getting a push on the ground. Ynet has learned that, in the last few days, the security establishment is beginning to actively work with external companies that will handle all humanitarian aid issues in the Gaza Strip, under Israeli supervision. This is the realization on the ground of plans that previously were only on paper. In addition, the IDF has deepened its seizure of territory in the Gaza Strip, expanding the axes it holds and establishing military outposts seemingly in order to seize a wide area and apply military administration in practice in the Gaza Strip. In recent days, lively discussions have been held on the issue between the various parties, including new Defense Minister Israel Katz, senior members of the defense establishment and other senior ministers, in order to promote the policy. According to sources familiar with the details, some officials in the Southern Command are pushing from within the system for the implementation of military administration of the strip, and are creating a dialogue with the political echelon on the matter. The move comes against the backdrop of two significant changes that delayed the cabinet members to the right of Netanyahu, and have now been removed: In Israel, the replacement of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant; and in the U.S., the victory of Donald Trump in presidential elections. Sources familiar with the details say that Gallant opposed Smotrich's ideas the West Bank and Gaza, and supported the position of the security system on a variety of issues. Among other things, Gallant opposed Smotrich's position on the demolition of outposts, issuing administrative arrest warrants for extreme right-wing activists, and on the day after in the Gaza Strip. At the same time, the plans for seizing the territory as part of extracting a price from Hamas in Gaza correspond with settlers' plans to settle northern Gaza. Officials in the settlement movement claim that this is a historic period of time to change reality on the ground vis-a-vis the Palestinians, and an opportunity that will not return. The same sources claim that a decision was made to not wait for the new Trump administration to enter the White House, but to already carry out operations on the ground and build plans that will form the basis for the activities of the new administration. In this context, a senior official in the settlement movement explains that the main thing is to 'maintain the integrity of the coalition at all costs.' Although no political decision has been made regarding the day after in the Gaza Strip, the main point of which is the establishment of a military administration, the government is dealing with it and working toward its realization. Besides the economic, logistical, infrastructural and security consequences of establishing a military administration, there are also far-reaching legal consequences regarding control over millions of Palestinians and the need to treat them humanitarianly. Legal sources point to a serious lack of clarity on the question of what Israel will do with Gaza after 13 months of war. Civilian control in Gaza means that Israel will be required to provide for the needs of the population –such as humanitarian aid, electricity, communications and sanitation - and not just allow international organizations to deliver food and vaccines. In the absence of a decision by the political echelon, Israel has in recent months been forced to deal with petitions to the High Court regarding the 'occupation' of the Gaza Strip - which involves many and weighty legal consequences about the treatment of the population, and also with international proceedings such as those conducted at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Another solution that is also on the table and which is not being promoted at all is giving control of Gaza Strip to another entity in the territory, such as the Palestinian Authority. This is a solution to which Netanyahu and members of his government are strongly opposed. Alternatively, it is possible that another country will take responsibility for the strip, but most are opposed to the idea as long as Israel's fighting in Gaza continues.

Biden approves anti-personnel mines for Ukraine, US official says	President Joe Biden has approved provision of anti-personnel land mines to Ukraine, a U.S. official told Reuters, a step that could help slow Russian advances in its east, especially when used along with other munitions from the United States. The United States expects Ukraine to use the mines in its own territory, though it has committed not to use them in areas populated with its own civilians, the official said. The Washington Post first reported the development. The United States has provided Ukraine with anti-tank mines throughout its war with Russia, but the addition of anti-personnel mines aims at blunting the advance of Russian ground troops, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity. The U.S. mines differ from Russia's as they are 'non-persistent,' and become inert after a preset period, the official said. They require a battery to detonate, and will not explode once the battery runs out.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj1rqkom1x	2024-11-19T19:52:02-08:00

Canada foils Iranian plot to assassinate human right icon Irwin C...	Since October 7, 2023, Cotler has been under 24/7 surveillance. On Monday, Canada announced it had foiled a plot by the Islamic Republic of Iran to assassinate renowned human rights activist and former Canadian Attorney General and Justice Minister Irwin Cotler. Cotler is globally recognized for his critical human rights work, including advocacy on behalf of Soviet Jewry before the fall of the Soviet Union. He also served as Canada’s special envoy for combating antisemitism. According to reports, Cotler was notified in October of an imminent threat to his life within 48 hours. Canadian police have been tracking two suspects but have not confirmed if any arrests have been made. Since October 7, 2023, Cotler has been under 24/7 surveillance. He has been a target of the Islamic regime since 2008, when he lobbied to have the IRGC designated as a terrorist organization.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy6oqyofyl	2024-11-19T19:26:13-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2018/01/10/8273471/8273471_0_132_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Turkey blocks Herzog's plane from airspace, Erdogan boasts	President Isaac Herzog reportedly canceled trip to UN climate conference in Baku after Turkey barred official Wing of Zion plane from airspace Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan confirmed Tuesday that Turkey barred the Israeli presidential plane, Wing of Zion, from using its airspace en route to a UN climate conference in Azerbaijan. 'We did not allow the Israeli president to use our airspace to attend the COP summit. We suggested alternative routes and options,' Erdogan told reporters at the G20 Summit in Brazil. 'On certain matters, as Turkey, we are compelled to take a stand, and we will continue to do so,' he added. The decision follows Turkey’s withdrawal of its ambassador to Israel for consultations after the Gaza war began, though diplomatic ties remain intact, and Turkey's embassy in Tel Aviv remains operational. Erdogan also noted that Turkey has severed trade ties with Israel over the war. President Isaac Herzog had planned to attend the climate conference in Baku on Tuesday aboard the Wing of Zion, the official plane for Israel’s president and prime minister. On Saturday, Herzog’s office announced the trip’s cancellation, citing 'security reasons' following a situation assessment. Sources in Israel, however, said that the Turkish airspace ban was a contributing factor but not the primary reason for canceling the visit. Security concerns stemming from alternate flight routes due to the Russia-Ukraine war also played a role, officials said. Additionally, Herzog’s recent trip to the U.S. to meet outgoing President Joe Biden meant he would have missed key leadership discussions at the climate summit, reducing the importance of the Baku visit. Diplomatic tensions arose as Azerbaijan sought to reframe the cancellation’s narrative, expressing displeasure with Israeli media reports. While Herzog canceled, other Israeli ministers attended the conference, traveling on commercial flights through Georgia. It remains unclear why Herzog did not opt for a similar travel arrangement.

Trump opposes Israeli West Bank sovereignty move, senior Republic...	While settlers euphoric and Smotrich hails 2025 as ‘year of sovereignty,’ senior Republicans warn president-elect opposes move, fearing it could jeopardize normalization with Saudi Arabia Despite enthusiasm from the Israeli right and pro-Israel conservatives following Donald Trump’s election as U.S. president, senior Republicans say Trump opposes applying Israeli sovereignty to Judea and Samaria, the biblical names for the areas of the West Bank. 'Trump will not approve annexation,' said a senior Republican senator close to the president-elect, calling such a move 'a mistake for Israel' that would worsen its international standing. The senator’s remarks follow speculation that recent Trump appointments, including Mike Huckabee as U.S. ambassador to Israel, signal support for annexation. Reports suggest Trump is concerned annexation could derail efforts to secure normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a top priority for the incoming administration. Veteran Senator Lindsey Graham is working on a deal to finalize the normalization agreement, coordinating with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, outgoing President Joe Biden and Trump himself. Sources say Graham sees bipartisan Senate approval of a U.S.-Saudi defense pact as key to achieving normalization. In Israel, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has labeled 2025 the 'year of sovereignty,' signaling annexation ambitions. However, senior Israeli political sources suggest Smotrich’s rhetoric is aimed at shoring up support among his base amid controversies over the ultra-Orthodox draft exemption law. While the settlers prepare to push annexation plans under the new U.S. administration, the likelihood of American recognition remains uncertain. Analysts say it could hinge on concessions to Palestinians as part of a broader Trump-led regional deal, raising questions about Smotrich and far-right ally Itamar Ben-Gvir’s willingness to compromise. Smotrich has expressed frustration with the outgoing Biden administration's embargo on working with him, saying, 'I look forward to working with the elected administration to strengthen economic and commercial ties.' At a faction meeting last week, he called Trump's victory 'an important opportunity for Israel,' adding, 'We were a step away from applying sovereignty, and now is the time to do it.' Smotrich reiterated his opposition to a Palestinian state, citing 'broad consensus in the coalition and opposition that it would endanger Israel’s existence.'

Israel explores security partnership with US firm for Gaza aid pi...	The defense establishment is in talks with the U.S.-based security firm Orbis, led by former U.S. Army generals, to explore a potential pilot project in northern Gaza, officials said Tuesday. The proposal was discussed in a meeting convened by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with Defense Minister Israel Katz, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. Sources familiar with the matter said Orbis has already drafted an initial pilot plan for the region. However, the proposal faced criticism for being 'highly problematic' due to the company's lack of experience in humanitarian aid distribution, officials added. The talks come amid ongoing efforts to address security and logistical challenges in Gaza.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk2hkkqfjl	2024-11-19T12:59:11-08:00

Oz, known as 'Dr. Oz', unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 2022. Trump, who endorsed Oz in that race, said he would work closely with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has been nominated to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump said the pair would take on 'the illness industrial complex, and all the horrible chronic diseases left in its wake' as well as cutting what he called waste and fraud. 'Our broken Healthcare System harms everyday Americans, and crushes our Country's budget,' Trump said in a statement.

2 Israelis extracted from Palestinian town after being attacked, ...	Ramla residents violently attacked after entering Dayr Balut in northern West Bank; pair rescued by Palestinian police officers and then extracted by IDF, suffering mild-to-moderate injuries Two Israeli citizens from Ramla were attacked Tuesday evening after entering the Palestinian town of Dayr Balut in the northern West Bank. The pair, reportedly there for business, were assaulted by Palestinians who recognized them as Israeli. Palestinian police intervened, rescuing the Israelis and handing them over to the IDF for extraction. According to the Civil Administration, the Israeli governing body that operates in the West Bank, both sustained mild-to-moderate injuries and are under medical care. Initial reports suggested one was unconscious, but it was later confirmed that both were conscious. The IDF has launched an investigation to confirm the identities of the two Israelis and determine why they entered the town. Palestinian officials allege the incident stemmed from a financial dispute. The military has since locked down Dayr Balut to search for the attackers. In August 2023, a similar incident occurred when an Israeli man accidentally entered a Palestinian village near Ramallah. He was attacked and his car was set on fire, but other Palestinians helped rescue him and ensured his safe transfer to Israeli authorities. Dayr Balut lies within Area A of the West Bank, which is under full Palestinian Authority control and makes up 18% of the territory. The IDF has reiterated warnings against Israelis entering Area A, calling it both prohibited and dangerous.

'Turkey needed to do this,' Erdogan clarified. 'As you know, we completely severed trade ties with Israel. We also did not allow the Israeli president to use our airspace on the way to Baku.

US ambassador-designate to Israel slams White House's 'schizophrenic' policy toward Israel; 'There’s no peace in that region until these terror groups funded by Iran are completely eliminated,' he says U.S. ambassador-designate to Israel Mike Huckabee criticized the Biden administration’s approach to Israel on Tuesday, accusing it of applying more pressure on the Jewish state than on its adversaries. 'We've put far more pressure, with Joe Biden, on Israel than we have on Hamas, Hezbollah and most importantly, the people who write those checks—the Iranians,' Huckabee told Fox News in an interview, describing the White House's policy toward Israel as 'schizophrenic.' He called for increased efforts to secure the release of American hostages held by Hamas, questioning why the administration has not applied greater pressure on the terrorist group and its backers. Huckabee dismissed calls for a cease-fire, saying that one could have been achieved immediately if Hamas ceased its attacks. 'We can have a cease-fire right now. We could have had it on October 8. Hamas lays down its arms, gives up its bombs, bullets, rockets and stops killing Jews, and lets the hostage free,' he said, emphasizing that 'breathing room' for Hamas would only prolong the war. 'They need to be suffocated and ended.' Huckabee called for the complete elimination of terror groups in the region, blaming Iran for their continued operations. 'There’s no peace in that region until these terror groups funded by Iran are completely eliminated,' he concluded.

Lebanese outlets report Avichay Adraee visited Kfarkela and Odaisseh, sparking online debate; one user accuses media of supporting him, another jokes he came to deliver evacuation warnings in person, while commenter insists he never entered IDF Arabic-language spokesman Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee posted on Tuesday a video of himself entering southern Lebanon for a tour of villages near the border, including Kfarkela and Odaisseh, sparking a heated debate among Lebanese citizens and media. Adraee, a well-known figure in the Arab world who frequently clashes with journalists and activists sympathetic to Hezbollah, said he visited 'areas Hezbollah has turned into forward military bases.' He shared a video from the tour, standing near rubble in Odaisseh, and said, 'This house was destroyed because Hezbollah used it as a terror stronghold. This is the state of many buildings in southern Lebanon and beyond. We continue to dismantle Hezbollah’s hideouts.' However, Lebanese social media users cast doubt on Adraee's claims. One user pointed out the lack of local signage in the footage, saying, 'If he really entered, he could have taken a picture next to a village sign.' Another noted smoke rising in the background, suggesting the video was filmed on the Israeli side of the border. Another user wrote: 'Avichay entered Kfarkela and Odaisseh. It seems he intends to deliver the warnings to us in person this time,' referring to evacuation warnings Adraee posts on his social media accounts to Lebanese citizens before Israeli strikes in populated areas. Lebanese media outlets reported widely on Adraee’s statements, with varying interpretations. The outlet Janoubia said Adraee aimed to deliver an 'important and clear message' in front of a destroyed home. The network LBCI cited his claims of a tour in southern Lebanon, while the newspaper An-Nahar referenced his presence in Kfarkela and Odaisseh. Another outlet, Al-Jadeed, wrote, 'Adraee from Kfarkela - Follow.' The extensive Lebanese coverage prompted criticism from some viewers, who accused the media of amplifying Adraee’s message. 'Why are they promoting Adraee? Or is it no surprise?' one user wrote, accusing outlets of inadvertently supporting his narrative.

Would Khamenei’s death bring reform or revolution to Iran?	A new leader, perhaps Khamenei’s son, could bring the illusion of reform or else spark a popular uprising; regime change, though possible, is thought to be unlikely Recent rumors surrounding Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s health have been largely dispelled, but questions persist about what will happen when the 85-year-old leader is no longer in power. The stakes are high. While many speculate on Khamenei’s successor, the broader concern centers on the nature of Iran’s impending political transition. Iranian journalist and analyst Ashkan Safaei Hakimi says there are two main scenarios: In one, a new leader attempts to mend relations with the West, likely creating only the perception of reform, and in another political instability triggers a popular uprising, potentially leading to regime change. Khamenei has served as Iran’s supreme leader for roughly three decades. Though the position is primarily spiritual, it wields immense power, with authority over major issues like foreign policy and the nuclear program. Speculation about Khamenei’s health began with an October 27 New York Times report hinting that his son, Mojtaba Khamenei, might be his successor. Over the weekend, claims surfaced that the supreme leader was in a coma. By Sunday, Iranian state media countered these rumors by publishing a photo of Khamenei meeting with Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani. Dr. Liora Hendelman-Baavur, director of the Alliance Center for Iranian Studies, speculated that the rumors could be an attempt 'to instigate or stir up domestic and internal protests or demonstrations to destabilize the system from the inside.' Widespread opposition to the regime persists in Iran. The Tony Blair Institute (TBI) reported that more than 4,000 street protests have taken place across the country’s provinces over the past two years. 'This is not a flash-in-the-pan moment for Iran but a movement with an unprecedented level of support across all demographics,' wrote Jemima Shelley, a geopolitics analyst for TBI. Rumors about Khamenei’s failing health are not new. In 2006, political analyst Michael Ledeen claimed he was in a coma, with similar reports resurfacing in 2009, 2014, and 2020. In 2014, Khamenei reportedly underwent prostate surgery in Tehran, though only the procedure itself was confirmed. Prostate cancer is a common global illness. Professor Shay Golan, head of the Urologic Oncology Service at Israel’s Beilinson Hospital, noted that millions are diagnosed annually, with approximately 3,000 new cases each year in Israel and 500 deaths. Golan explained that in cases of metastatic, stage IV prostate cancer, severe complications like comas or multi-organ failure can occur. 'But that is at the end of the disease,' Golan said. 'Usually, prostate cancer grows really, really slowly, and today, we can diagnose the disease in its very early stages. If patients get diagnosed in the early stage, 90% of them can be cured of the disease.' Even in later stages, advances in treatment mean patients can 'live for years in good health and good quality of life.' However, Golan emphasized that such outcomes are primarily seen in Western countries. In low- and middle-income nations like Iran, access to advanced treatments is limited, and life expectancy in such cases may be as short as two to three years.

PM says Israeli forces 'relentless in efforts' to bring hostages home; 'Anyone who dares harm our hostages will pay with their life,' he warns and offers $5 million award to anyone who returns a captive Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Tuesday that Hamas’ rule in Gaza is over, as Israeli forces continue their campaign against the terrorist group across the Palestinian enclave. 'Hamas will no longer rule Gaza. We are now targeting their governing capabilities, and our mission is far from over,' Netanyahu said during a visit to the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza alongside Defense Minister Israel Katz, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar. The visit included a briefing from senior military officials and a discussion with reservist brigade commanders about the ongoing military campaign against Hamas. Netanyahu praised the military’s efforts in dismantling Hamas’ capabilities. 'Our forces have achieved remarkable results in eliminating Hamas’ military strength across the Gaza Strip,' he said. The prime minister reiterated Israel’s commitment to securing the release of hostages held by Hamas since the October 7 attack. 'We are relentless in our efforts to bring them home—both the living and the deceased,' he said, warning those responsible for holding the hostages: 'Anyone who dares harm our hostages will pay with their life. We will pursue you, and we will reach you.' Netanyahu also offered an incentive for cooperation, promising a $5 million reward per hostage and safe passage for anyone who aids in their release. 'The choice is yours, but the outcome will be the same: We will bring everyone back,' he said. Acknowledging the sacrifices of Israel's soldiers and their families, Netanyahu commended the resilience and dedication of reservists. 'Our soldiers and commanders are performing exceptional work. I salute our reservists and their families for their unwavering support,' he said. 'The people of Israel stand united behind you.' Katz said the government was 'committed to providing all necessary resources and making decisions that will enable our troops to complete their missions,' and praised the bravery and professionalism of Israeli forces. 'I don’t think there’s an army in the world that can point to achievements of this kind,' he added. Katz underscored that 'the most important mission is to bring the hostages home,' and echoed Netanyahu's statement about defeating Hamas and ensuring the terrorist group 'will not rule here in the future.'

Republicans for settlements: New GOP lawmakers ready to make West...	As Donald Trump prepares for return to White House, Shomron Regional Council head holds round of meetings in Congress and hears support from lawmakers advocating for Israel to apply sovereignty to West Bank West Bank settlers are preparing for President-elect Donald Trump's entry into the White House. While the heads of the settlements gathered to formulate an action plan for the president-elect's new term in office, the head of the Shomron Regional Council, Yossi Dagan, left for a visit to the United States that included meetings with senior Republicans and members of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington. The meetings were, of course, mainly concerned with the hope of applying Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank, also known as Judea and Samaria. Republican House of Representatives lawmaker Claudia Tenney of New York is an ally of Dagan. 'I am a partner in the legal initiative that will guarantee the rights of Samaria and Judea and make sure that they will be recognized and not called 'the West Bank' when talking about products and other things produced in this area. I am a strong supporter of Israel. We are very excited to cooperate with you, and we will be happy to return to Samaria in the future,' she said. Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska did not address the issue directly, but expressed his support for Israel. 'After the terrible attack on October 7 and what Israel had to do to defend itself, I look forward to defending your sovereignty and your security in this new administration you will find an administration that's got friendship for Israel as opposed to what happened in the past administration.' According to Maryland Rep. Andy Harris: 'When all is said and done, the two-state solution just doesn't work. It's got to be a one-state solution, with obviously Judea and Samaria in part of the State of Israel. That's the way it has to be. This is the only solution that will ensure sustainable peace.' Dagan also met with the chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy, U.S. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, and Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, who said that it is important to maintain the 'excellent relations' between the two countries. 'The relationship between the U.S. and Israel, with an emphasis on stopping the harassment and obsessive persecution against the Jewish settlement in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria,' said Dagan. 'We presented to the members of Congress with our request and demand that the U.S. government either support or not oppose and thwart sovereignty over the Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria. We have partners here who have promised to be involved in this matter,' Dagan said. 'Even if the U.S. administration cannot say that it is in favor of it, and even has to say that it is opposed, it will not fight the way the Biden administration would have fought.' He also called on the prime minister and government ministers to act. 'The ball is in your court. You can apply sovereignty immediately upon the entry of the Trump administration,' he said.

Hamas attack on Israel stirs controversy among Gaza clerics	Well-known Palestinian cleric questions harm caused by Oct. 7 attack, including high civilian death toll, while local group of religious leaders asserts Hamas assault legitimate The Hamas attack on Israel that triggered the Gaza war has stirred debate among the enclave's Palestinian clerics, with some saying it was not worth the heavy civilian death toll and others declaring the October 7, 2023 assault was a Muslim duty. Some 1,200 Israelis were killed on that day, and some 251 people were taken hostage into Gaza, of which 101 hostages, both dead alive, are still held captive. It was the country's bloodiest day in its history. Israel responded with a destructive offensive in Gaza. Responding to questions sent by Gazans on an online messaging platform, prominent preacher Suleiman Al-Dayya said Muslim leaders should avoid going into battles if the harm inflicted upon civilians is greater than the gains. He said warriors should question the wisdom of fighting if it increases the harm to religion, life, honor, children or wealth or the seizure of land, let alone the destruction of the 'foundations of life.' Dayya's views are well respected in Gaza among both ordinary residents and Islamists, and he also has influence with Palestinians in the West Bank. A former senior member of the Muslim Brotherhood, the oldest Islamist movement in the Arab world, he was also close to Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, co-founder and leader of the Palestinian terror group Hamas, before pursuing a more moderate form of Islam. 'When it becomes highly likely that the objectives and aims of jihad will not be achieved due to the absence or deficiency of its pillars, causes or conditions, it must be avoided,' said Dayya. Late on Monday, a statement issued in the name of 'a group of clerics' in Gaza defended the assault as a 'legitimate act and a fulfillment of the duty of jihad, with no doubt about its legitimacy.' 'However, was the timing of the decision a mistake in judgment, as it led to this destructive war afterward, or was it appropriate due to specific circumstances known to the fighters, for example? This is a matter open to consideration,' the statement said. 'But such consideration and placing of blame are not appropriate during the war; they should come afterward, as it serves no purpose now and rather harms,' it added. In their statement, the clerics' group said they appreciated Dayya's opinion and religious status but they cautioned his verdict could be misunderstood and could affect the spirit of ordinary Palestinians as well as fighters. Some Gazans are also questioning the wisdom of Hamas staging an attack that led to Israel's relentless bombardment of Gaza, which was already struggling with widespread poverty and high unemployment before the war erupted. For Israelis and their Western allies, Hamas is a terrorist group that has fired missiles at them and staged suicide bombings. Hamas' supporters regard its fighters as heroes leading the fight for Palestinian statehood, which had drifted off the international agenda. Israel, which has assassinated several top Hamas leaders, has vowed to destroy the group.

Rockets strike Italy's UNIFIL base in Lebanon, Italy's Defense Mi...	Eight rockets hit the headquarters of the Italian contingent of the U.N. peacekeeping force UNIFIL in Shama, in southern Lebanon, Italy's defense ministry said on Tuesday. No injuries have been reported but five Italian soldiers are being monitored in the base's medical facility, the ministry said in a statement. Italy has long been a major contributor to the UNIFIL multinational operation. Investigations are under way to determine where the rockets originated and to identify those responsible, the Italian ministry said. The rockets hit some outdoor areas and the base's supply warehouse where no soldiers were present.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryjwgs5m1l	2024-11-19T07:54:53-08:00	
Iran offers to cap sensitive uranium stock to avoid IAEA resoluti...	Iran has offered not to expand its stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% purity, near the roughly 90% of weapons grade, and made preparations to do that, the U.N. nuclear watchdog said in confidential reports to member states on Tuesday. The offer is conditional, however, on Western powers abandoning their push for a resolution against Iran at this week's meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency's 35-nation Board of Governors over its lack of cooperation with the IAEA, diplomats said, adding that the push was continuing. During IAEA chief Rafael Grossi's trip to Iran last week, 'the possibility of Iran not further expanding its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% U-235 was discussed', read one of the two confidential quarterly IAEA reports, both seen by Reuters.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy4szsqf1g	2024-11-19T07:50:04-08:00	
US imposes sanctions on senior Hamas officials	The U.S. on Tuesday imposed sanctions on six senior Hamas officials, the U.S. Treasury Department said, in further action against the Palestinian militant group as Washington has sought to achieve a ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza. The Treasury Department said in a statement the sanctions targeted the group's representatives abroad, a senior member of the Hamas military wing and those involved in supporting fundraising efforts for the group and weapons smuggling into Gaza. 'Hamas continues to rely on key officials who seemingly maintain legitimate, public-facing roles within the group, yet who facilitate their terrorist activities, represent their interests abroad, and coordinate the transfer of money and goods into Gaza,' Treasury's Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Bradley Smith, said in the statement. 'Treasury remains committed to disrupting Hamas' efforts to secure additional revenue and holding those who facilitate the group's terrorist activities to account.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1iobs5mjl	2024-11-19T07:49:28-08:00	
Water is more precious than gold here': Turkey's strikes on Syri...	Report sheds light on dire consequences of Ankara's bombing campaign against Kurdish forces in Syria, leaving residents relying on water deliveries; Kurdish leaders accuse Turkey of attempted 'genocide' while legal experts suggest strikes may constitute war crime Turkey’s extensive airstrikes on Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria have disrupted the water supply to over a million residents in the region, a BBC investigation published Tuesday revealed. Experts cited in the report suggested the attacks may constitute a violation of international law. For years, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has led bombing campaigns and ground invasions across the border targeting Kurdish forces, which Ankara accuses of ties to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The PKK, which seeks Kurdish autonomy in Turkey, is classified as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S., the European Union and the UK. The Kurdish YPG militia, a key component of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that governs this area—informally known as 'Syrian Kurdistan'—helped defeat ISIS during the last decade. However, Erdogan has consistently labeled the YPG as an extension of the PKK. The recent escalation follows a PKK-claimed attack on a military facility in Ankara last month. In retaliation, Turkey launched a wide-scale bombing campaign against Kurdish targets in Syria, though the YPG denied any involvement in the attack. According to the BBC investigation, accompanied by a full-length documentary, Turkey has conducted over 100 attacks on Kurdish-controlled northeastern Syria between October 2019 and January 2024. These strikes targeted oil and gas facilities and power stations vital to civilians in the region. According to the report, the attacks have worsened an already dire humanitarian situation, exacerbated by years of brutal civil war and four years of extreme drought linked to climate change. The crisis escalated further in October 2023, when Turkish strikes on power infrastructure cut electricity to the region’s primary water station, rendering it inoperable. The BBC team visited the region twice and reported that residents in Hasakah province, home to around one million people, are now relying on water deliveries from sources 12 miles (20 kilometers) away. Hundreds of water tankers are dispatched daily, but supply shortages force authorities to prioritize hospitals, schools and orphanages, leaving many residents without access. During one visit to Hasakah, BBC reporters observed residents queuing desperately for water and pleading with tanker drivers for supplies. 'Water is more precious than gold here,' said Ahmed al-Ahmed, a water tanker driver. 'People need more water. All they want is for you to give them water.' The report described fighting breaking out among residents waiting in line, with one woman threatening to puncture a tanker’s tires if it didn’t deliver water to her. Yahya Ahmed, co-director of the city water board, described the situation as a 'humanitarian catastrophe.' The autonomous Kurdish administration in northeastern Syria has accused Turkey of attempting to 'destroy our people’s existence' in the region. Following a new wave of Turkish airstrikes last month, Kurdish officials claimed that Ankara targeted not only military positions but also civilian infrastructure, such as power stations. 'The main goal is to weaken the Kurdish autonomous administration and force the population to flee,' said SDF Commander Mazloum Abdi. In an interview with AFP, Abdi also accused Turkey of exploiting the global focus on the wars in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as tensions with Iran, to escalate attacks against the Kurds. Abdi criticized the U.S.-led coalition, calling its response to the strikes 'weak' and insufficient to halt the assaults. 'Pressure must be applied on Turkey,' he said. The Kurds remain a key partner in the U.S.-led coalition, which maintains around 900 American troops in Syria to combat jihadist terrorist groups. In a statement to the BBC, Turkey claimed its airstrikes target the 'sources of income and capabilities' of Kurdish separatist groups it regards as terrorists. The Turkish government denied hitting civilian infrastructure and blamed the worsening humanitarian crisis in northeastern Syria on climate change, as well as poor water management by local Kurdish authorities and neglected infrastructure. Turkey also insisted it 'fully respects international law' and said that 'Civilians or civilian infrastructure were not among our targets and have never been' a target. However, the BBC highlighted a 2022 remark by Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who said that any 'infrastructure, superstructure and energy facilities' used by the PKK or YPG in Syria and Iraq are 'legitimate targets' for Ankara. In February, the UN accused Turkey of potentially committing a war crime during its October 2023 strikes on Kurdish power infrastructure, which disrupted access to water for civilians. Legal experts familiar with the BBC investigation echoed these concerns. '[T]he indications that international law was violated here are so strong that they should be investigated by a prosecutorial authority,' said Patrick Kroker, an international criminal law expert.

IDF reservist killed by Hezbollah drone strike in southern Lebano...	Sergeant First Class (res.) Omer Moshe Gaeldor, 30, soldier from Golani Brigade's 5111th Reconnaissance Battalion, from Jerusalem, killed during operational approximately 2 kilometers from border; 3 other soldiers seriously wounded in attack The IDF reported that Sergeant First Class (res.) Omer Moshe Gaeldor, 30, a soldier from the Golani Brigade's 5111th Reconnaissance Battalion, from Jerusalem, was killed Tuesday morning when a Hezbollah explosive drone struck an IDF unit operating in southern Lebanon. Gaeldor is survived by his wife, Adi, and their two young children, 3-year-old Neta and 8-month-old Aluma. Three other soldiers were seriously wounded in the attack and were airlifted to an Israeli hospital. Their families have been notified. The strike occurred approximately two kilometers from the border while the troops were securing operations deeper into southern Lebanon. The IDF said that Hezbollah has intensified its efforts to target Israeli forces in southern Lebanon with rockets, mortars and drones. The military is working to provide early warnings, intercept threats and disrupt such attacks. Gaeldor, formerly a resident of Neve Tzuf in the West Bank, was eulogized by Benjamin Regional Council head Yisrael Ganz. 'Today, we bear a heavy price and mourn the loss of a hero who gave his life to protect the people of Israel. The state will continue to strike its enemies until full victory is achieved. We embrace his wife, Adi, and the entire family,' Ganz said. In Gaza, the military reported Sunday the deaths of Capt. Yogev Pazy, 22, a platoon commander in the Kfir Brigade’s 90th Battalion, from Giv’ot Bar, and Staff Sgt. Noam Eitan, 21, a fighter in the same battalion, from Hadera. The soldiers were killed during a clash with terrorists in Jabaliya, northern Gaza. Another soldier was seriously injured, and his family has been notified. Pazy was the nephew of Knesset member Gadi Eisenkot, whose family has also suffered additional losses in the war, including his son, Master Sgt. (res.) Gal Meir Eisenkot, and nephew, Sgt. Maor Cohen Eisenkot. 'The heart aches for these two heroes who fell in Gaza today,' said National Unity Party leader Benny Gantz. 'Our thoughts are with Hanan, Gadi and the Pazy family during this painful time.'

The course description also discussed 'the US-backed and -funded genocide being carried out against Indigenous Palestinians by the Israeli Occupying Force.' UC Berkeley stated that 'this is a course designed by graduate students. The content of the course, including the syllabus, has not been approved by the responsible lecturer, the head of the department, the department or the academy's management. The course description was published without sufficient review and was removed from the campus websites pending the end of a strict academic review.

Lavrov said he hoped Moscow's new nuclear doctrine, in which President Vladimir Putin lowered the threshold for a nuclear strike, would be attentively read.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1z7cmqm1g	2024-11-19T05:01:34-08:00	
Response is inevitable': Putin alters Russia's nuclear doctrine ...	Ukraine launches attack into Russian territory with Western-made weapons following U.S. approval, pushing the Kremlin to consider nuclear option against fellow nuclear states Russian President Vladimir Putin has officially approved changes to his country’s nuclear doctrine, the Kremlin announced on Tuesday. Under the revised framework, Moscow now threatens a potential nuclear response even to a conventional attack against Russia – if such an attack is carried out with the 'aid' of another nuclear power. This is widely interpreted as a clear warning to Western nations arming and supporting Ukraine. The Kremlin's announcement coincides with Kyiv marking 1,000 days since Russia's invasion on February 24, 2022. It's viewed as a response to U.S. President Joe Biden’s recent approval, allowing Ukraine to use American long-range missiles for strikes deep into Russian territory. Over recent months, Putin has repeatedly threatened a severe response should Biden grant such permission. In September, he warned that it would alter the scale and nature of the war in Ukraine, signaling direct involvement by NATO, the U.S. and Europe, since NATO personnel and infrastructure would necessarily be involved in guiding and launching such attacks. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that the updated nuclear doctrine aims to ensure 'potential enemies' understand that Russia’s response to any attack on itself or its allies would be 'inevitable.' He stressed that any assault by a non-nuclear state on Russia, conducted in cooperation with a nuclear state, would be considered a joint attack by both nations. 'This is a very important point,' he said during a press conference. Peskov further argued that expanding the scenarios for potential nuclear use was 'essential' given the 'current state of affairs.' However, he didn’t directly respond when asked whether this was a direct reaction to the U.S. decision to allow Kyiv to target Russian territory with U.S. weaponry — a move Ukraine had long advocated for, claiming it was fighting 'with one hand tied behind its back' without such approval. Peskov also reiterated that Moscow 'always' sought to reduce nuclear threats, considering them an 'extreme' measure meant solely for deterrence. Nonetheless, the updated nuclear doctrine effectively broadens the Kremlin’s conditions for launching a nuclear strike, providing more detailed scenarios compared to the previous framework. According to the changes, which were advanced in the weeks leading up to the U.S. elections but only now formalized, Russia could respond with a nuclear attack to a conventional assault on its territory if it involves aid from a nuclear-armed state. The new doctrine also outlines the possibility of using nuclear weapons in the event of a 'massive air strike' involving ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, fighter jets, drones and other aerial munitions. Any aggression against Russia by a nation that’s part of a coalition – presumably NATO – would now be treated as aggression by the entire coalition. The new doctrine also allows for consideration of a nuclear response to aggression against Russia’s ally, Belarus. The UK condemned Putin’s decision shortly after its announcement, saying the president’s move was the 'latest example of irresponsibility from a depraved Russian government,' according to a spokesperson for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. When asked about the new nuclear threat posed by Russia, Starmer told the BBC that: 'We remain steadfast in our support for Ukraine.' Meanwhile, Russia has begun serial production of mobile bomb shelters that can protect against a variety of threats including shockwaves and radiation from a nuclear blast. The emergency ministry's research institute said the 'KUB-M' shelter could offer protection for 48 hours against these and other natural and man-made hazards. Among those it listed were: explosions and shrapnel from conventional weapons; falling debris from buildings; dangerous chemicals; and fires. The 'KUB-M' looks like a reinforced shipping container and consists of two modules - a room for 54 people and a technical block. More modules can be added if needed, the institute said. It did not link the move to any current crisis, though the announcement came days after the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden agreed to allow Ukraine to fire U.S. long-range missiles deep into Russia - a decision that the Kremlin said was reckless and would draw a response from Moscow. 'The mobile shelter is a multifunctional structure that provides protection for people from various threats, including natural disasters and man-made accidents,' the research institute said, calling it 'an important step towards improving the safety of citizens'. It can easily be transported on a truck and connected to water supplies, and can also be deployed in Russia's vast northern permafrost, it added.

Hochstein says there is a real opportunity for cease-fire	U.S. envoy speaks to reporters after meeting Lebanese speaker of parliament who represent Hezbollah in talks to end the war; says decisions must now be made U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein said on Tuesday that he had held 'very constructive talks' with the speaker of Lebanon's parliament in Beirut and that there was a 'real opportunity' to bring the conflict between the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah and Israel to an end. Hochstein arrived in Beirut earlier for talks with Berri who represents Hezbollah in the negotiations and with Lebanese care-taker prime minister Najib Mukati. 'This is a moment of decision-making. I am here in Beirut to facilitate that decision but it's ultimately the decision of the parties to reach a conclusion to this conflict. It is now within our grasp,' he told reporters after the meeting. While Hochstein was visiting, Hezbollah launched a missile at the center of Israel, wounding five people as rocket fire to the north continued all morning. The Hezbollah-affiliated al Akhbar newspaper said in a report on Tuesday that Hochstein's visit is the final attempt to reach a deal, but obstacles remain. According to the paper the two issued that must be resolved are Israel's 'self -defense' and the make-up of the international commission that will oversea compliance with the terms of the agreement. Lebanon says self-defense is already recognized under international law and therefore does not have to be a part of the cease-fire deal and that Israel's insistence to include it is an attempt to legitimize any future military action it would take. Lebanon therefore rejects it. Beirut also opposes the participation of the UK and Germany in the international commission overseeing compliance of the agreement, but sources told the publication that that matter could be more easily resolved. Saudi Arabia's Al Hadath channel in its report on Tuesday, quoted sources who said the U.S. wanted Lebanese agreement to American supervision of the Beirut International Airport and the sea ports as well as its supervision of the borders to prevent the influx of arms for Hezbollah arriving from Syria. According to the channel Hochstein was negotiation an agreement that would encompass all of Lebanon and not only the south.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1d5px5fjx	2024-11-19T02:45:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/19/Syd0mxczJl/Syd0mxczJl_0_152_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Israel proposes sanction relief for Assad, to stop flow of arms t...	Lebanese paper says Strategic Affairs Minister raises possible lifting of sanctions from Russian and Syrian companies after meetings in Moscow Israel proposed that some U.S. sanctions should be lifted from Syrian President Bashar Assad in exchange for his involvement in preventing the flow of arms to Hezbollah across the Syrian border with Lebanon, the Lebanese daily Al Jounhouria reported on Tuesday. According to the paper, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer raised the possibility of sanction relief to ensure Russian involvement in the effort to block the smuggling of arms from Syrian territory into neighboring Lebanon and block what has been termed the 'Iranian highway,' connecting the Dahieh in Beirut to Iran via Syria and Iraq. Dermer committed to request the Biden administration to freeze sanctions on Assad as well as Russian and Syrian companies. The idea was discussed during the first Trump term and may have come up now after his reelection. Dermer was in Moscow earlier in the month on a secret visit to try and promote the matter. Israeli officials said there was an understanding that Russia can influence Hezbollah, Syria and Iran and that Moscow was hoping for a cease-fire in the war in Lebanon. The Wall Street Journal reported in an article on Tuesday that Russian-made weapons were found in by troops in Hezbollah's weapons stores in South Lebanon and that new, even recently produced weapons made in Russia were transferred through Syria recently and replace old Soviet-era armaments.

Russian-made weapons found in Hezbollah arsenal, report	Anti-tank missiles produced as recently as 2020, among stocks found by troops in South Lebanon delivered via Syria, raising concerns of deepening Moscow-Tehran cooperation; 70% of seized Hezbollah weapons are Russian made The IDF found Russian-made weapons in Hezbollah stores in South Lebanon, the Wall Street Journal said on Tuesday. Among the weapons made in Russia were anti-tank missiles sent in recent years to Lebanon via Syria which had been receiving Russian weapons for years. Israel had not been able to confirm the flow of Russian-made weapons to the Iran-backed terror group until its forces were on the ground in South Lebanon, the journal said. According to the outlet, citing a Syrian security official, some of the munitions, including anti-tank missiles manufactured as recently as 2020, were sent to the country from Russian stocks located in Syria. The news contradicts earlier Israeli assessment that the terror group only used Soviet era weapons from the 2006 Second Lebanon War in 2006. The discoveries also increased fears in Israel, according to the Wall Street Journal, that Moscow was deepening relations with the Iran-backed group despite its insistence on neutrality in the conflict. 'Israel needs to be more assertive and defend its interests,' Arkady Mil-Man, a former Israeli ambassador to Russia, told the outlet. 'We must explain and convey to the Russians that we will no longer stand any assistance to Hezbollah and Iran that could hurt Israelis,' Mil-Man, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv, said. Both the Russian government and the Syrian foreign ministry refused to comment on the inquiry made by the Wall Street Journal. Russia's focus on the Middle East According to the article, Russia's stance in the Middle East has shifted since the start of the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, despite Israel’s efforts to maintain friendly relations with Moscow, so as to avoid conflicts in Syria, where Russia has a strong military presence. Analysts told the outlet that Russia was now actively seeking to harass the U.S. and its allies wherever possible. The report also detailed how the Russians provided aid in the form of munitions and military intelligence to Yemen’s Houthis, who have taken an active part in attacking Israel since the outset of the Gaza war on October 7. Moscow has also allegedly delivered anti-air defense systems to Hezbollah, thoughthere was no confirmation of the transaction, according to the Wall Street Journal. The WSJ detailed Russia’s warming relations with Hamas since the start of the war, hosting its political leaders several times in Moscow while seeking to reconcile the terror group and Fatah. Russia’s growing support comes against the backdrop of its deepening relations with Iran, who delivered the same drones and ballistic missiles to Moscow as it did to its proxy Hezbollah. According to a report, Russia's involvement in Syria has had a ripple effect on the region’s military dynamics, particularly concerning Hezbollah's access to advanced weaponry. Russia deepened its ties with Syria following the outbreak of Syria’s civil war in 2011, intervening militarily to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The outlet reported that Russia not only provided weapons to Syria but also maintained its own stockpiles in the country. Around 2015, Russian forces began collaborating with Hezbollah fighters on the ground, strengthening ties between the two groups. Russian weapons make 70% of seized arms in Lebanon ground operation According to Syrian security officials and an Arab official cited in the report, this relationship facilitated Hezbollah's access to Russian arms in Syria, including advanced weapon systems like antitank, antiaircraft and anti-ship missiles. The frequency with which Hezbollah obtained Russian weapons remains unclear, according to the Wall Street Journal. Traditionally, much of Hezbollah's arsenal has come from its patron Iran. However, Israeli officials have reportedly found a significant number of Russian-made weapons in southern Lebanon during recent operations. The outlet detailed a visit to Israel's National Munition Disassembly Lab, where seized materials from southern Lebanon are analyzed. The lab revealed an array of Russian weaponry, including Kornet and other guided antitank missile systems like Metis, Konkurs, Fagots and Saggers. These weapons were discovered in Hezbollah bunkers both above and below ground, less than a kilometer inside southern Lebanon an Israeli major told the Wall Street Journal. According to the Israeli officer, Russian-made arms comprised 60-70% of the weapons seized in the early days of Israel’s recent invasion of southern Lebanon. IDF Reservists reportedly continue to encounter Russian weapons in the area. From Moscow to Lebanon via Syria While the exact methods by which Hezbollah acquired these arms remain uncertain, some of the captured weapons bore markings linking them to Russia’s shipments to Syria’s defense ministry. The outlet reported that markings on some weapons, such as the Kornet, confirmed their Russian origin rather than being Iranian copies. One set of rockets even had labels in Russian indicating shipment to Syria. However, not all seized weapons carried such identifiers. The timeline for these deliveries is unclear, but the report noted that some weapons were manufactured as recently as 2020, while others, like the Saggers, date back to the 1980s. Fabian Hinz, a military research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, highlighted the importance of reliable, short-range missiles like the Kornet to Hezbollah’s operations. According to the Wall Street Journal, Hinz said these weapons have enabled Hezbollah to carry out a more efficient campaign against Israel compared to Hamas, which primarily relies on less reliable Iranian-made versions. Adam Rousselle, a researcher at Militant Wire, noted that the Kornet and two other Russian-made antitank missiles seized by IDF forces have featured prominently in Hezbollah attack videos since October 7, 2023 and have played a significant role in Hezbollah’s military tactics. An Israeli staff sergeant involved in medical evacuations in Lebanon described anti-tank missiles, including Kornets, as the most effective tools for targeting IDF soldiers and noted that these missiles can strike from a range of 7–8 kilometers (4.3–5 miles). While Hezbollah has suffered setbacks from IDF military actions, the sergeant stressed its strength relative to Hamas, largely due to its advanced arsenal. The Wall Street Journal reported that the IDF has displayed weapons seized from Hezbollah during ongoing combat operations in Lebanon. Israeli officials have pointed to two key objectives of their operations: neutralizing the threat posed by anti-tank missiles near Israeli communities and forcing Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force back north of the Litani River. The report also noted growing concerns among analysts and officials regarding Israel's diplomatic approach toward Russia. While many Western nations have provided military aid to Ukraine in its war against Moscow, Israel has limited its support to non-military aid, a stance believed to be influenced by its desire to avoid provoking Moscow. Carmit Valensi, a senior researcher at the INSS, criticized this approach. 'We need to sober up from this approach. It’s no longer just Russian support for the axis of resistance that is unconnected to Israel. We are meeting this in the battlefield and it is extracting casualties,' she said.

Hamas enforces rule by punishing aid theft in Gaza	The terror group claims to have executed at least 20 thieves who looted aid trucks, leading Gazans to hope prices of basic goods will drop as a result Gaza-based terror group Hamas announced on Monday it had carried out a 'successful elimination operation' against 20 looters who have allegedly taken over humanitarian aid in the enclave and claimed they were the ones who oversaw prices of stock being sold to remaining markets in the Strip. The report comes against the backdrop of efforts to prevent the group from taking over aid being delivered to Gaza and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s directive asking the IDF to 'make plans to diminish Hamas’ political and governing capabilities.' 'A 25-kilogram (55-pound) sack of flour, which feeds one family for a day, costs 400 shekels ($100). The situation has become unbearably dire,' A Gazan staying in one of Khan Younis’ camps said. 'Thieves began stealing massive amounts of goods and aid, driving up prices.' 'This group of criminals had been sentenced to death but escaped Hamas prisons after the war. However, Hamas managed to regain control and eliminate them in one swift operation. We're relieved that we'll finally receive food and water,' he added. Sources within Gaza's Hamas-controlled Interior Ministry claimed that over 20 gang members involved in thefts of aid trucks were killed during a 'high-quality security operation' carried out by the terror organization's security services in collaboration with tribal committees east of Rafah. As part of Hamas' efforts to solidify its rule in the Strip after over 13 months of fighting and heavy losses, sources told Hamas' Al-Aqsa channel that 'the operation marks the beginning of an extensive and carefully planned security campaign that will continue to target all involved in the theft of aid trucks, which significantly impacted civilians' lives and led to hunger in southern Gaza.' Hamas’ Interior Ministry said that the operation wasn’t aimed at specific tribes but asked to eliminate the phenomenon of truck looting. On Sunday, the 'popular committees,' a body established by Hamas to 'protect' aid, announced the execution of four thieves. 'The field executions are part of an integrated plan to address the crimes of aid truck robberies,' the ministry said. 'We will continue to pursue lawbreakers and thieves who steal the food of the Palestinian people.' Meanwhile, the German government announced on Monday of €6 million ($6.5 million) in financial aid to enhance the UN mechanism for expediting humanitarian aid delivery to Gaza. The funds will be delivered under an agreement with the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS), tasked with overseeing secure aid distribution. The financial aid is part of Germany's humanitarian commitment to support international efforts to address Gaza's worsening crisis, in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2720 (2023), aimed at improving aid distribution through UN-monitored humanitarian corridors. Despite reports of Hamas stealing and reselling aid at inflated prices, displaced Gazans are now anticipating price reductions that will enable them to purchase basic goods. Estimates suggest that about 500 thieves, operating in gangs, have been stealing aid since the war began. Senior Israeli officials have instructed the security bodies to intensify actions against aid looters in Gaza, asking to ensure that aid doesn’t fall into the hands of hostile elements like criminal syndicates and Hamas terrorists. Ynet learned that approximately 15 aid trucks were looted on Monday in the area by armed individuals. The IDF responded by opening fire at others attempting to loot additional trucks, foiling their efforts. While no official government directive has been made regarding the aid distribution, the IDF and the security officials have recently taken measures to tighten control over its delivery. According to security officials, certain points and junctions have become hotspots where looters attack and rob the trucks. Some Hamas terrorists have also managed to seize portions of the aid.

Shin Bet Chief's secret visit to Turkey amid Hamas developments	Ronen Bar's visit highlights geopolitical tensions as Qatar reportedly expels senior Hamas officials to Turkey; Israeli official says Turkey will get involved in hostage deals, leaving Egypt as the sole mediator following Qatar's announcement it was stepping back Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar recently made a clandestine visit to Turkey, meeting with Ibrahim Kalin, head of Turkish intelligence agency Millî İstihbarat Teşkilatı (MIT). This meeting occurred amid reports that Qatar expelled senior Hamas leaders who subsequently arrived in Turkey. An Israeli official clarified that Turkey will not serve as a mediator in any hostage negotiations. Instead, their role might involve exerting pressure on Hamas, with Egypt emerging as the primary mediator following Qatar's announcement. Earlier, a Turkish diplomatic source refuted claims that Hamas had relocated its political offices to Turkey, stating that members of the organization were merely visiting. 'Members of Hamas' political branch visit Turkey from time to time. Claims that Hamas moved its offices to Turkey do not reflect reality,' the source asserted. Bar's secret visit followed the cancellation of Israeli President Isaac Herzog's planned trip to the climate conference in Baku, partially attributed to Turkey's refusal to allow Herzog's plane to fly through its airspace en route to Azerbaijan. Local Azerbaijani media initially reported on this, feeling slighted by Israel's announcement citing 'security considerations' for the cancellation. Azerbaijani sources confirmed this to Ynet, and Israel acknowledged Turkey's refusal as a factor, though not the sole or primary reason for the cancellation. Herzog was scheduled for a brief visit to Baku on Tuesday, with plans to use the 'Wing of Zion' aircraft, designated for official overseas visits by the Prime Minister and President. A statement from the President's residence mentioned, 'Due to a situational assessment and for security reasons, the President has decided to cancel his trip to the climate conference in Azerbaijan.' Israeli sources noted security alerts; however, Jerusalem clarified that at no point was there a claim of a security issue within Azerbaijan itself. The Azerbaijani response to Israel's announcement was less than favorable. A senior source in Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry informed the 'Caliber' website that the reason for Herzog's visit cancellation was unrelated to security but was instead due to Turkey's prohibition of the use of its airspace by Herzog's aircraft. 'Unfortunately, intensive negotiations through diplomatic channels over several days did not yield results. Azerbaijan provides an overall concept for holding the conference and creates conditions for the participation of all parties. However, the situation regarding the Israeli president's visit arose for reasons beyond our country's control,' the source added.

Hezbollah fires missiles at central Israel as Hochstein arrives i...	IDF says at least 5 projectiles launched some intercepted; Lebanon opposes IDF freedom to operate on its territory, opposes participation of UK, Germany in international commission overseeing compliance of the deal, Hezbollah-affiliated publication says Hezbollah fire targeted central Israel's Sharon Plains on Tuesday after a missile launched at the greater Tel Aviv area on Monday, causing damage and some injuries. U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut on Tuesday to advance negotiations for a cease-fire to end the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Hochstein is expected to receive Lebanon's final response to the proposed deal and deliver it to Israel. The Hezbollah-affiliated al Akhbar newspaper said in a report on Tuesday that Hochstein's visit is the final attempt to reach a deal, but obstacles remain. According to the paper the two issued that must be resolved are Israel's 'self -defense' and the make-up of the international commission that will oversea compliance with the terms of the agreement. Lebanon says self-defense is already recognized under international law and therefore does not have to be a part of the cease-fire deal and that Israel's insistence to include it is an attempt to legitimize any future military action it would take. Lebanon therefore rejects it. Beirut also opposes the participation of the UK and Germany in the international commission overseeing compliance of the agreement, but sources told the publication that that matter could be more easily resolved. Saudi Arabia's Al Hadath channel in its report on Tuesday, quoted sources who said the U.S. wanted Lebanese agreement to American supervision of the Beirut International Airport and the sea ports as well as its supervision of the borders to prevent the influx of arms for Hezbollah arriving from Syria. According to the channel Hochstein was negotiation an agreement that would encompass all of Lebanon and not only the south. The success of the negotiations would open the way to a final drawing of the international border between Israel and Lebanon. But the envoy's success is not guaranteed, Al Hadath said. Nabih Berry, Lebanon's speaker of parliament who was negotiation on the part of Hezbollah wanted to pressure the Iran-backed terror group to agree to American's proposed terms.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjpovnfzje	2024-11-18T22:03:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/19/rJf7vnYGke/rJf7vnYGke_0_0_640_533_0_small.jpg

Among the weapons made in Russia were anti-tank missiles sent in recent years to Lebanon via Syria that had been receiving Russian weapons for years. Israel had not been able to confirm the flow of Russian-made weapons to the Iran-backed terror group until its forces were on the ground in South Lebanon, the journal said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyyusjfgjx	2024-11-18T21:11:10-08:00	
Would the Iranian regime collapse if Khamenei dies?	Prof. Shai Golan: Advanced prostate cancer can lead to severe complications like coma and multi-organ failure Iran has released a photo of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei amid widespread rumors on social media claiming he is either in a coma or has died. The image shows Khamenei in his office speaking with Iran’s Ambassador to Lebanon, who was injured in Beirut during Israel’s September strikes on Hezbollah. Speculation about Khamenei’s health began with an October 27 New York Times report suggesting he was 'seriously ill' and that his son might succeed him. On Saturday, claims surfaced that the 85-year-old had fallen into a coma. Experts have cast doubt on these reports, suggesting they could be true or false. Khamenei’s health has been under scrutiny for two decades, with recurring rumors of illness and potential succession. Officials consistently deny such claims, often releasing photos to refute them. A similar pattern occurred last night with the ambassador’s meeting. Rumors date back to 2006 when political analyst Michael Ledeen claimed Khamenei was in a coma. Similar reports emerged in 2009 and 2014, when Khamenei underwent prostate surgery believed to be for cancer. Speculation resurfaced in 2020. Prof. Shai Golan of Beilinson Hospital told ILTV News that advanced prostate cancer can lead to severe complications like coma and multi-organ failure. However, prostate cancer typically grows slowly and has a 90% cure rate with early detection. Iran’s healthcare challenges, however, could shorten survival to two or three years if Khamenei has advanced cancer—though this remains unconfirmed. Khamenei cannot unilaterally name his successor. The Assembly of Experts, comprising 88 Shia clerics, must elect the next Supreme Leader. Would the regime collapse if Khamenei dies? Iranian journalist Ashkan Hakimi outlined two theories: a new leader could seek better relations with the West, or public unrest could lead to regime change. For now, these scenarios remain speculative until Khamenei’s health status is clarified.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry8crjymkl	2024-11-18T20:50:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/27/By2x9til1e/By2x9til1e_0_35_2295_1292_0_small.jpg

Doctors warn: Hostages at severe risk of life-threatening illness...	Report says need for immediate humanitarian intervention As Israel's hostages endure over 400 days in captivity, medical experts are raising urgent alarms about their heightened vulnerability to severe illnesses and diseases, particularly with winter fast approaching. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has issued a humanitarian report detailing the dire health conditions many captives are likely facing. According to the report, some hostages have lost up to 50% of their body weight, significantly compromising their immune systems. This leaves them at increased risk of contracting diseases, as well as facing potential complications such as frostbite, hypothermia, cardiovascular conditions, and respiratory infections in the coming months. The report underscores the pressing need for immediate humanitarian intervention to address these life-threatening risks.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1yyiktg1g	2024-11-18T18:51:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/07/ryATF11Wk1x/ryATF11Wk1x_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
‘Israel should control Gaza for at least two or three years’	Yoni Ben Menachem: More security forces are needed to find the hostages, not a ceasefire deal Israel should control Gaza for at least two or three years to eradicate Hamas from the area, according to Yoni Ben Menachem of the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs. Speaking to ILTV News, Ben Menachem said that only if Israel takes over Gaza and 'works freely' could it kill all the terrorists, dismantle Hamas’s military infrastructure and destroy the tunnels. 'This is a long process,' Ben Menachem said. 'We cannot do it now without the full control in Gaza and also controlling the civilians.' As such, he said it is premature to sign any ceasefire agreement with Hamas, which he anyway does not believe will bring Israel’s hostages home. On Monday, G20 leaders, the leaders of the world’s biggest economies, called for 'comprehensive' ceasefires in both Gaza and Lebanon in a joint statement at a summit in Brazil. But Ben Menachem said that Hamas has no intention of signing a deal and that Israel has not done enough militarily to bring the hostages back. 'The IDF did not apply enough pressure, military pressure, in Gaza in order to find the hostages, and they did not make enough intelligence effort to locate the hostages,' he told ILTV. 'What is needed is to bring more forces into Gaza and intensify the intelligence gathering in order to get to the hostages.' He said Hamas would continue to blame Israel for not signing a deal, but if ultimately something was signed, he does not believe the hostages would come home anyway. 'This is why we have to do it ourselves,' he said.

British commander Richard Kemp: Talk of ceasefire with Hezbollah ...	Kemp says 'the handcuffs are going to be taken off Israel' under US President Donald Trump It is 'premature' for Israel to sign a ceasefire deal with Lebanon, according to British commander Richard Kemp. He told ILTV News last week that the ceasefire efforts are being driven by the Biden administration, which wants to see some conclusion to the war before U.S. President Joe Biden leaves office. However, he said that Israel's work against the terror organization Hezbollah is not done. 'Israel needs to do much more damage to Hezbollah, and it effectively needs to create a situation where Hezbollah becomes demilitarized as a longer-term objective, and that there is a very significant buffer zone between the Israeli border and the southern part of Lebanon, to the extent that there is no longer a direct threat to the residents of Northern Israel who can then return home,' Kemp said. 'That is not necessarily going to happen overnight.' Overnight, Reuters reported that Lebanon and Hezbollah have agreed to a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire with Israel, with some comments. Israel did not comment. Kemp stressed that Iran drives all seven battlefronts on which Israel is fighting. He has been a strong advocate for a U.S. administration that would take action against Iran alongside Israel or at least untie Israel's hands so it can cut off Iran, which he referred to as the head of the octopus. 'Israel can't do that without the support of the US,' Kemp said, referring to the ability to cut off Iran where it is at literally. 'Israel can inflict severe damage on the Iranian regime and the Iranian nuclear program, but it can't do that without the backing of the U.S. 'In the ideal world, I think the US would also go in and attack Iran with Israel,' he continued. However, he said that he does not envision that happening even under newly elected President Donald Trump. 'I do think is going to happen is the handcuffs are going to be taken off Israel to allow it the freedom to do what it needs to do and inflict significant damage on Iran so that Iran is no longer in a position to run all of these different proxies around the region against Israel and against the West,' Kemp concluded.

Look me in the eyes': Ex-Hamas hostage leaves pro-Palestinian ac...	Newly surfaced debate video shows Moran Stela Yanai, abducted by Hamas on October 7 and later released, sharing her story to clearly speechless pro-Palestinian activist; 'I respected them even when they abused me,' she said of her captors A debate event held last June in Los Angeles featured participants such as Mosab Hassan Yousef ('The Green Prince'), Moran Stela Yanai—a survivor kidnapped and held captive by Hamas, UCLA Y&S Nazarian Center for Israel Studies Director Prof. Dov Waxman and pro-Palestinian activist Aidan Dewolf, the organizer of a protest encampment at the same university. This event went viral on Monday following the release of the second part of the interview, where Yanai directly addresses and speaks with Dwolf. In this newly released second segment, published four months after the initial interview, Yanai is seen addressing the pro-Palestinian activist, saying, 'I really want to talk to you on eye level and tell you a story, if you want to hear it. '...When I was kidnapped to Gaza, I was caught three times. The last time, I was caught by 13 Hamas terrorists. Thirteen. I want you to acknowledge the facts as they are, truly. I’ve visited the U.S., have you ever been to Israel? Have you visited Gaza before? Probably not,' she recounts. 'On October 7, and this is what they (the terrorists) told me, they had no idea about the Nova festival, they didn’t know there were 3,000 people there. They planned, and this is what they told me, to continue onward and kill as many people as possible. In Be'er Sheva, Tel Aviv, Haifa—they wanted to slaughter everyone. 'And you know what, maybe you won’t believe me, but I can show you the videos that I have. Do you know how many bodies were there? Do you know how much violence I experienced firsthand? I was caught in the middle of the lynch; I was portrayed as a soldier because I chose that day, unintentionally, to wear olive-green clothes that looked like a uniform. That was enough to classify me as a soldier. 'And they treated me like a soldier. I’m 40 years old, look at me, I’m 40. I have a cat and a dog; I had two cats, I lost one that day. I have a mom and dad, and a brother, who left their whole lives to try and help me. My mom found out I was kidnapped through my 12-year-old niece, who saw a video on TikTok and recognized me. That’s how they found out I was kidnapped. Did you know that?' Yanai continued her dialogue with Dwolf for several more minutes, during which it was clear that he felt very uncomfortable with the direct yet calm way she presented her story to him, even struggling to maintain eye contact. Social media reactions quickly followed, with many praising Yanai's quiet strength and the way she shared her story and words with Dewolf. It should be noted that Yanai is a jewelry designer who went to the Nova Festival near Kibbutz Re'im on October 7, 2023, to sell her jewelry. During the Hamas attack on the festival, she was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists and taken to the Gaza Strip, where she was held captive for 54 days. During her captivity, Yanai had to endure harsh conditions, including humiliation and abuse. She recounted in several interviews how she was forced to beg for food and her captors' demand that she look them in the eyes, which left her with deep psychological scars. After her release, Yanai underwent a lengthy rehabilitation process. In January 2024, she returned to her home in Be'er Sheva and has since continued to share her story to raise awareness about the situation of hostages and encourage the public to advocate for them.

Pro-palestinian activists vandalize home of University of Washing...	University of Washington President Ana Mari Cauce's home and car vandalized with pro-Palestinian graffiti ahead of regents meeting on campus protests; university and ADL condemn act as crime; law enforcement investigating The home and car of University of Washington President Ana Mari Cauce were vandalized with spray-painted messages, including 'Free Palestine,' 'Blood on Your Hands,' and 'Ana Mari is Complicit in Genocide.' The incident occurred the night before a Board of Regents meeting to discuss campus policies and responses to ongoing pro-Palestinian protests. A pro-Palestinian student group shared footage of the vandalism on Instagram, claiming the act as a form of protest. The video shows masked individuals stenciling messages on Cauce’s front door and car, accompanied by a caption accusing her of complicity in 'Palestinian genocide.' Flyers with protest demands were distributed in the neighborhood, alleging the university’s ties to Boeing enable war crimes. The protesters claimed Boeing supplied half of Israel's missiles from 2021 to 2023, including those used in refugee camps. They accused the university of whitewashing Boeing’s image, citing donations exceeding $100 million and its influence in career fairs and on the university's Board of Regents. The protesters condemned Cauce, who has led the university for nearly a decade, for dismissing prior demands to sever ties with Boeing. They referenced a past statement attributed to her: 'Someone that you barely know does something pretty awful, you make one set of decisions. Someone that has been a close friend of yours since you were two (Boeing) does something pretty awful, you look at it a little bit differently.' In a statement, the protesters vowed continued action, declaring: 'So while Palestinians cannot experience peace, neither can she!! Neither can anyone who serves genocide.' University spokesperson Victor Balta condemned the vandalism, calling it 'a crime' and saying that university policy would not be influenced by threats or criminal acts. He confirmed that multiple law enforcement agencies are investigating. The Seattle chapter of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) also denounced the incident, labeling it 'vandalism, threats, and property destruction by masked activists.' The ADL called for those responsible to be held accountable and warned against escalating anti-Israel rhetoric turning violent.

Hamas' sexual crimes: Uncollected evidence come to light	Previously undocumented indicators of sexual violence by Hamas during October 7 attacks now emerging through new report compiling evidence and survivor testimonies; findings aim to shed light on scope of atrocities Warning: This article contains content some readers may find disturbing In the chaos at the IDF's Shura base on the days following the October 7 massacre, bodies of the murdered – soldiers, civilians and the occasional body that, after examination, turned out to be that of an abominable Nukhba terrorist, were piling up. On one body alongside grenades, they found an open packet of condoms. 'I read about this in the newspaper. It was part of a journal kept by a guy from Shura,' says leading Israeli lawyer, Prof. Yifat Bitton. 'Our investigator contacted him and asked, ‘Tell me, did you report this to anyone?’ He said, ‘No. We had to deal with neutralizing the grenades. Why should I be dealing with condoms?’' What might have been regarded on the ground as a rather marginal detail, for Prof. Bitton leading the struggle for recognition of Hamas’s sexual offenses, it was a warning sign. 'For me, a terrorist with condoms indicates sexual offense. Maybe the packet of condoms was on him because he’d had consensual sex just before that, and the box had simply remained in his pocket. 'However as, in the wave of terrorist incursion incidents, we have no way of verifying this, and as we know that when armed men are in an environment where women are helpless, there’s a very high risk of sexual harm, these condoms may attest to sexual assault. If Hamas can, they’re welcome to prove otherwise. Until October 7, we hadn’t seen sexual assault as part of organized Hamas operations. This perception, however, needs to change.' What does this story prove in terms of our investigations? That condoms are marginal to grenades? 'Not just marginal. It’s about seeing an outright indication right before your eyes, and erasing it from your mind. Not just because it’s not important. 'Yes, some people thought it was less important - like the senior Division of Identification and Forensic Science (DIFS) official who told me, ‘Listen, when I have the worst crime of all, murder, I don’t have to, and can’t, deal with this too.' But what they were looking at was sexual offense. Conditions also play a role: under any other circumstances, I’d examine the body in great detail, but I had 500 more bodies waiting in line.' The mass of bodies meant you couldn’t tell the whole story. 'Yes. Everyone in the Hell that was Shura had a very specific task in identifying the bodies. They remained within the area and didn’t leave it. Either their eyes didn’t look over the entire body, or they did, and decided that they couldn’t really see it and couldn’t deal with it. Psychologists we interviewed told us that this is how it works – so as to protect the workers’ mental health from permanent damage. But this, apparently minor, story is a new way of looking at what happened here.' 'The dead are dead' December 2023, a few months prior to that conversation, Bitton gave a speech at a conference she had initiated at the UN to promote world awareness of the horrific massacre’s incorporation of systematic gender-based violence. On returning home to Herzliya, however, she felt something wasn’t right. Something in the way the story was framed was distorting the big picture. 'A lieutenant colonel told me that he saw a woman tied to a pole, naked from the hips up. When I asked him what he did, he told me that he took her off the pole and completely covered her up.' 'I revisited my speech’s opening sentence in which I said that nothing in my 20 years of representing victims of sexual offenses and researching the issue, had prepared me for this moment. I asked myself why I’d opted for this sentence. Why had nothing prepared me for this? After all, it’s no surprise that women are harmed on the battlefield. Why weren’t we prepared for this moment? I felt I knew only parts of what had happened. The entirety of what happened, however, was unprecedented and so demanded new decoding tools. 'We’re trying to use existing tools to understand something that hasn’t happened in the past. This is severely detrimental to our professional ability to prove what happened and explain why the evidence is so sparse relative to the scope of attacks. I realized it would be best to listen to people who were on the ground at the time, and through them, identify the true scope of sexual offenses on October 7.' This realization led Bitton, President of Achva Academic College and head of Israel's Public Colleges Association, to an almost year-long quest resulting in an extremely comprehensive, in-depth report on October 7 sexual offenses. Alongside attorneys Vardit Avitan and Shir Burka and lawyer, Hodaya Shaked, she questioned and interviewed dozens of people from the field who saw the worst things a person could imagine. This culminated into 80 pages in Hebrew, translating into 100 English pages, to serve Israel - not just in Hasbara terms, but also for international legal purposes. In their own personal time, and modestly funded by two foundations, the researchers set out with a clear mission. 'I asked myself, why this had gotten me so much. Why couldn’t I just deal with the other horrors that occurred there? I eventually realized that the situation I was now seeing, is one so often exposed when it comes to assaults - mainly against women – and that are sidelined. This isn’t very different from what we know about sexual violence in general. It needs working on, pushing, and explaining why it matters. 'The last thing I wanted was for the sexual offenses to be used as yet one more tool with which to goad the enemy. I was looking for a way to forge recognition for the victims. I was looking to find out how, knowing what we do about these incidents, we could set up dedicated treatment and investigation structures. This was my prime motive. And no one really wanted to do it.' Did exposure to these materials affect you personally? 'The material was, obviously, very difficult. I am sadly, however, very experienced when it comes to the horrors of sexual offenses. Although it was unprecedented in terms of its scope and malevolence, I must stress that as soon as the project was about means for identifying and gathering evidence, that’s what we focused on. 'It’s also been very hard to prove the degree to which the interviewees were repressing what they’d seen or felt or were experiencing secondary trauma - that arose from the interviews. Some felt guilty, and it was important for me to explain to them that, considering the shock and chaos of what happened to us, there was nothing to feel guilty about.' The report - whose findings were forwarded to officials at Israel’s National Security Council (NSC), terrorism specialists and the authorities at the United Nations Security Council responsible for dealing with sexual violence - reveals obstacles faced by various systems, that have prevented widescale documentation of the scale of the sexual assaults. These obstacles are expressed by 'first respondents,' professionals who, on October 7, encountered what we couldn’t have imagined in our worst nightmares. These include Zaka, police and Border Police, personnel as well as doctors at Camp Shura. This failure touched on not only gathering evidence, but also the preliminary inquiry. It turns out that Israeli combatants in the massacre areas weren’t asked questions about sexual offenses. A senior police officer says in the report that this was sometimes a conscious decision, 'so as to keep soldiers’ spirits robust, as they were returning to the battlefield.' Another senior ranking Border Police officer told the investigator that she saw, 'Loads of bras and underwear strewn around the party ground.' Bitton says, 'She hadn’t told anyone before, as she wasn’t asked questions about indications, but rather about sexual offenses. 'If you ask, ‘Did you see sexual assaults,’ the answer would be no. But if you were to ask, ‘Did you see anything relating to women that looked odd to you,’ she’d say, ‘Actually yes.’ For me, this constitutes an indication of sexual offenses. That same officer did not photograph what he saw, and also instructed her subordinates not to photograph them either.' Why? 'Because they were told, ‘We need to focus on the people who are alive. The dead are dead.' I heard this cited by both soldiers and psychologists. ‘This is what matters,' ‘This is what’s relevant.' These are the quotes. We’re now talking about an accumulation of almost 500 pieces of digital evidence. 'I remember two burned bodies whose legs were spread. In real time, we wanted to identify the bodies, not find out what had happened to them.' 'In the videos, you don’t have to look for gang rape. You need to look for pictures of underwear on the ground. Understanding that we have to ask about indications, rather than the sexual offenses themselves, is groundbreaking.' Many interviewed said that they didn’t forward the evidence they had photographed on their personal phones. 'For example, pictures including very serious indications of sexual offenses, not passed on for fear of violating the victim’s privacy,' says Bitton. A senior Zaka official, who was present at the massacre scene, said he had a whole gallery of pictures he’d taken on his phone that he didn’t know what to do with.' 'A lieutenant colonel told me that he saw a woman tied to a pole, naked from the hips up. When I asked him what he did, he told me that he took her off the pole and completely covered her up. ‘It was important for me to put an end to her denegation, and certainly not document her in this horrific condition.' I understand the compassion by which he was guided, but that shouldn’t negate the importance of documentation, as long as there are clear and ethical guidelines as to how to do it.' Hodaya Shaked, who collaborated on the report alongside Prof. Bitton, says, 'One interviewee told me that, while surveying and clearing the bodies, he found a used condom on a bed in a house in the Gaza Periphery. He didn’t think to report it, and only thought about it differently when we talked about it.' From these examples, we learn of the lack of readiness for terrorism that incorporates sexual violence - not just in the field, but afterward too, at Camp Shura. 'Naked, or partially naked, bodies were showing up at Shura, and no one documented it,' says Bitton. 'At Shura, they photographed operational injury. They didn’t, for example, photograph bruising adjacent to sexual organs.' Coining a term: Sexual terror attack Dr. Naama Samet, oral and maxillofacial surgery specialist, who has been volunteering with the IDF’s victims’ identification unit for the past 15 years, encountered this in the six weeks she spent identifying hundreds of bodies at Shura. She supports Prof. Bitton and her investigation team’s grim conclusions. 'The thought of sexual assault didn’t cross our minds,' she says. 'We just opened up the top part of the body bags. On the second or third day, a Zaka guy rolled in a body in a cart. Helping him bring it in, I said, ‘There’s something strange here.' I thought there was another body inside. We then removed the body bag and saw that the pelvis was very clearly broken. This is how we understood that sexual assaults had occurred.' Did it change the rest of the examinations? 'No. There wasn’t time for that. At some stage, you close up, just to get through. I remember two burned bodies whose legs were spread. In real-time, we wanted to identify the bodies, not find out what had happened to them. That was a mistake, but it would have taken months had we acted otherwise. There were horrific stories there.' Bitton continues, 'We suddenly realized that burning the houses and bodies or shooting the sexual organs was, in part, means to conceal the sexual assaults. Pramila Patten (United Nations Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, who came to Israel in January and then compiled a report concluding that sexual assaults by Hamas had indeed occurred), confirmed there had many gunshots at sexual organs, mainly but not only, of women.' 'At first, we viewed it as some kind of sexual obsession of theirs or efforts to eliminate sexuality. I now tell myself that this, in and of itself, constitutes sexual assault and that I can perhaps use this as an indication of covering up acute sexual assaults.' In hindsight, we understand that assaults were on a greater scale, that so much evidence has been buried. 'Definitely. We’re proving that very clearly.' Legal research and security expert Capt. (res.) Att. Shir Burka, who has been serving as war room commander at the Gaza Division for over a decade, was called on the afternoon of October 7 to the Northern Brigade’s improvised war room in the south of the country. 'As a war room officer, I experienced first-hand the tremendous chaos on the ground in the first days after the attack. Our priorities were clear: protecting human life, evacuating the dead and wounded, and preparing for an attack. At no stage were we briefed about sexual offenses.' 'With my background representing victims of sexual assault, as our work on the report progressed, I saw evermore gaps in the evidence and I could only scream out against the omission and the possibility that so many forces on the ground could have contributed toward identifying and documenting sexual offenses. But hindsight‘s 20/20. Had there been any awareness of it, things would have certainly looked different.' Bitton: 'Visiting one of the Gaza Periphery communities, I asked a local man to show me where the horrors had taken place. I wanted to be there, to smell it, hear the silent voices of the people I’m trying to make heard. As he was talking, I realized that he was, inadvertently, showing me a strong, horrific indication of the acute sexual abuse of two women. 'Realizing this, and not wanting to upset him, I asked him questions around the subject. With my tools, I continued the investigation in the house, went back to my interviewees, reconfirmed that what I had heard was correct, and learned that I was correct in my assessment. Talking to a police representative, I found that the police didn’t know about it.' What did he say constituted an indication? 'He said that something just didn’t hang together about the house we were in. It was clear that what happened here, wasn’t what he had thought, and that he had no explanation as to what had happened, and that was telling himself the same story everyone probably tells themselves: They see an indication, but don’t regard it as demonstrating a high chance of sexual assault.' Didn’t that put you in the position of police investigator? 'Definitely not. I’m not here to replace the police. We always forwarded new stories or evidence to which we were exposed. That’s not my role, and shouldn’t be anyone else’s role. That’s the state’s role.' 'It’s critical the state should adopt this report, the bodies mentioned in it read it, understand what’s missing in their work, and make corrections accordingly.' In their report, Bitton and her partners present new perceptions. Firstly: the obstacles faced in collecting and documenting evidence of sexual offenses, are rooted in this being a totally different kind of attack. And secondly: it may well happen again. Let’s start with the first. The investigators called the October 7 terrorist attack an 'incursive incident.' Bitton says, 'This short-term attack on the land of a sovereign Westen state is a world-first. It’s an incursive terrorist incident in that they were invaders, they wandered around in the field, caused destruction, and left. 'Sexual offenses in Ukraine, for example, were part of an ongoing war. This is in no way similar to an incursive incident whose main purpose was killing as many people as possible, in which the victims were killed systematically.' Prof. Boaz Ganor, President of Reichman University and the founder of the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT), who ranks among the world’s top terrorism experts, reiterates this. 'I don’t remember any similar incident in modern times. Perhaps, the Boko Haram attack in Nigeria where they kidnapped girls from school, hurt them, and sold them as concubines. We also saw ISIS do this to the Yazidi women.' Ganor addresses another terrifying report conclusion regarding the likelihood of a second such attack in the wider world. 'In the history of modern terrorism, attacks carried out against the State of Israel, serve as a model copied by other organizations. In the 1960s, Israel ranked among the countries suffering most from airplane hijackings. 'We then saw it spread to other places, among other things, because Israel found ways to better address the issue. It was similar with suicide attacks that started here in 1992, and a decade later became familiar in Europe and the U.S. So, one must ask whether October 7 could serve as a model to be imitated in other Western countries.' And what do you think? 'I think that an incursive terrorist attack like this can be imitated in places adjacent to territories over which the state has no effective control. If we look at Europe and the US, it doesn’t seem likely. However, we’re beginning to see areas over which the state has little, or no, effective control. 'Even in Europe, there are areas - like Brussels’ Molenbeek neighborhood, that the police and law enforcement authorities seldom, or fear to, go. Paris also has quarters like this. I believe we’ll probably see incursive terrorist attacks from such neighborhoods in Europe, similar in essence to the October 7 incursion attack.' What do you feel this report contributes? 'It has two important aspects. Firstly: casting light on the horrific sexual offenses committed on October 7. Secondly: addressing the challenges faced by first respondents arriving at the scene of such a huge incursive terrorist attack, who are busy dealing with other issues like saving lives, fighting, and obviously not collecting the facts required to prove sexual offenses. 'In the wider world, some people are still saying that these claims are some kind of Israeli scam. This report says that, alongside other activity, it’s also important to have clear guidelines and operating methods to gather the evidence, not only for indictment purposes, but also to show the world.' Challenges in making sense of evidence 'It was important for me to investigate how these various structures operated,' says Bitton. 'Was there any kind of awareness, and what did they do? The answer is that people on the ground were not aware of it, and so did almost nothing. I’m not criticizing them. It’s Hell. Guilt must rest on Hamas who caused the chaos.' The report, however, presents the state’s failures. 'We have to view them as shortcomings - the inability to imagine. I call it, ‘When the unimaginable becomes a reality.' It’s a nightmare. It no use judging in hindsight.' Att. Vardit Avidan, Bitton's team’s sexual protection expert, supports this. 'It was important for us to cast blame on Hamas. Yes, a response could have been better in some cases, but if we prepare correctly, we’ll be able to get better evidence in the future.' How? Bitton: 'I learned that the DIFS is the only organization that can identify dead civilians in Israel. This is the only body in the country authorized to conduct this procedure. The identification process involves taking fingerprints, dental photos and conducting DNA tests. This means that Israel’s number one investigation body was conducting an activity that’s very easy to train people on the ground to do.' 'The sheer workload meant that that it was a month before DIFS got into the field, by which time the crime scenes had been corrupted, damaged or destroyed. This was the case for the Nahal Oz outpost where dozens of male and female soldiers - and the highest number of women - were murdered. 'The army’s surveillance unit, with its forensic documentation expertise (which it may utilize in the future) didn’t manage to get there at all. Instead, Zaka evacuated the bodies from the scene to another kibbutz. One interviewee told me ‘By that stage, you couldn’t understand who was who.'' 'These are evidentiary problems from Hell. There was also a lack of collaboration between the various respondents who were working under fire and the fear of being kidnapped. And yet, when we finally come to talk about sexual offenses, they have the tenacity to ask us, ‘Where’s your evidence?.'' Has anything changed in procedures since then? 'The answer is not yet. That’s why I believe it’s critical the state should adopt this report, the bodies mentioned in it read it, understand what’s missing in their work, and make corrections accordingly. We know that this doesn’t generally happen on its own, so we need a body to handle these incidents and oversee that it really does happen.' 'As for overseas, I’m supposed to meet international organizations in the United States soon to explain to them what this means for them. I’m working with the embassy to present it at Congress. The German parliament’s representative to the United Nations has also asked me to forward the report to her, and there’s a coalition of sorts of politicians from across the globe, set up by Yesh Atid MK Shelly Meron, who want to address the matter at an international level.' This is impressive, but how willing is the world to listen to Israel while the war is still ongoing? 'Our story isn’t making waves - to say the least. I think the world isn’t listening to the story from the Israeli angle, or even the women’s angle. It might be of interest to various terrorism experts and anyone fighting terror. 'Transferring the burden of proof to the terrorist organizations in a structured manner, as the report does, is of great interest to them. In this respect, I think they are listening, as it’s a story with universal implications. Explaining that this is a universal story, rather than just an Israeli story, is part of the issue. And as a universal feminist, it’s important for me to protect women – whoever they may be.' Although the world’s women’s organizations messed up. 'Lots of them behaved shamefully because, among other things, I think, it’s connected to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and they believe it couldn’t happen to women in the middle of Europe. In my dealings with these organizations, I don’t behave as if I’m angry with them, but rather I’m critical of their failure to fulfill the role they’ve been mandated to perform. 'This professional report, which explains how these situations should be managed, is a strong tool to address the international community’s disgraceful conduct and one that can be relevant later for indictment purposes. Presenting this to the world is, essentially, part of the new challenges that terrorism poses to humanity. Under no circumstances should this story be sidelined.'

Lebanon, Hezbollah agree to US proposal for cease-fire with Israe...	Lebanon and Hezbollah have agreed to a U.S. proposal for a cease-fire with Israel with some comments on the content, a top Lebanese official told Reuters on Monday, describing the effort as the most serious yet to end the fighting. Ali Hassan Khalil, an aide to Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, said Lebanon had delivered its written response to the U.S. ambassador in Lebanon on Monday, and White House envoy Amos Hochstein was traveling to Beirut to continue talks. 'Lebanon presented its comments on the paper in a positive atmosphere,' Khalil said, declining to give further details. 'All the comments that we presented affirm the precise adherence to (UN) Resolution 1701 with all its provisions,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkfb4vfm1x	2024-11-18T12:40:40-08:00

The IDF said Monday that an investigation into the impact site in Ramat Gan determined the damage was caused by debris from a rocket intercepted by air defense systems. According to a preliminary assessment, the interceptor struck a surface-to-surface rocket launched from Lebanon at a high altitude, breaking it into several fragments. Some of the debris fell to the ground, causing damage and injuries, the IDF said. 'The incident is under investigation,' the military added in its statement.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rygzweyzkg	2024-11-18T12:27:50-08:00	
Berlin police advise LGBTQ and Jews to avoid Arab-majority areas	Berlin Police Chief Barbara Slowik urges visibly Jewish and LGBTQ individuals to exercise caution in Arab-majority neighborhoods, citing open antisemitism and sympathy for terrorism; police recorded 6,200 antisemitic incidents since October 7 Once regarded as a bastion of inclusivity and cosmopolitan culture, Berlin is increasingly reflecting broader trends sweeping Germany: rising radicalization among Muslim migrants, a political shift to the right and heightened antisemitism and fear of violence. Berlin Police Chief Barbara Slowik acknowledged these changes in an interview with the Berliner Zeitung daily, saying that while the city does not have 'no-go zones,' certain areas may be unsafe for visibly Jewish individuals or members of the LGBTQ community. 'There are, unfortunately, neighborhoods in Berlin with a majority of residents from Arab backgrounds where there is open sympathy for terrorist organizations and very blatant antisemitism,' she said. Since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Berlin police have launched investigations into 6,200 antisemitic incidents, including physical assaults, online hate speech and attacks on police during pro-Palestinian protests. Antisemitic incidents have surged by 50% compared to 2022, with two-thirds occurring after October 7. LGBTQ individuals in Berlin have also reported a growing fear of violence in neighborhoods with significant Arab populations. Many members of the community now conceal their identities, avoid public displays of affection and seek escorts when leaving bars in these areas. In a notable incident, the owner of a prominent LGBTQ pub in Kreuzberg opposed the establishment of a refugee shelter nearby, citing ongoing physical assaults against her patrons by local residents. Slowik warned that Berlin’s police force is stretched thin, citing increased responsibilities since October 7, including daily pro-Palestinian protests and heightened security for Jewish and Israeli institutions. 'Our resources are being tested to their limits,' she said, calling for greater support to address the mounting challenges.

FM Sa'ar urges UN to address attacks on Israel by pro-Iran militi...	Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar announced Monday that he has sent a letter to the president of the UN Security Council, urging immediate action to address the activities of pro-Iranian militias operating in Iraq, whose territory has been used for attacks on Israel. Sa’ar emphasized in the letter that the Iraqi government is responsible for any actions occurring within or from its territory. He stressed Israel's right to self-defense, as enshrined in the UN Charter, to protect itself and its citizens. 'I called on the council to act urgently to ensure that the Iraqi government fulfills its obligations under international law and to put an end to these attacks on Israel,' Sa’ar said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skvec7kmjx	2024-11-18T12:14:26-08:00	
Achtung! Germany, other EU nations set to tighten entry due to im...	European nations tightening border controls as far-right influence rises; Germany, Netherlands lead with stricter checks citing illegal immigration and security concerns; from 2025, biometric data and new entry protocols will apply for non-EU citizens The resurgence of populist far-right movements across numerous Western nations is a well-documented trend. However, in recent weeks, this tide of anti-immigration, anti-democratic and anti-European Union sentiment has been accompanied by a reimplementation of stringent border security measures. Once emblematic of a peaceful, integrated Europe characterized by open borders and seamless cross-national movement, these ideals now seem distant as border protections are being re-enforced. This shift challenges the very relevance of the Schengen Agreements, a treaty that led to the creation of Europe's Schengen Area, in which internal border checks have largely been abolished. Countries like Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Austria and Denmark have heightened border security, with some extending these measures into May and June 2025. Germany spearheaded this initiative, responding to growing opposition to illegal immigration and concerns over radical Islam by reinstating strict border checks with France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Denmark. The right-wing Dutch government announced similar measures last week. Despite a post-COVID-19 rebound in European tourism throughout 2024, escalating illegal immigration, expanding criminal networks and terrorism fears are likely to result in prolonged border crossing times, especially for non-European passport holders. While existing regulations, such as the allowance for stays of up to 90 days every six months for non-EU passport holders remain unchanged, enforcement is set to intensify, particularly at land borders. This will impact those traveling between Schengen countries by car, bus or train. Starting in 2025, those entering Europe without an EU passport will undergo biometric registration, including fingerprinting, with data stored for three years. Additionally, from the beginning of next year, all foreign nationals exempt from visa requirements will need to complete an online form with a nominal fee to stay in Europe, akin to the U.S. ESTA system. Under the Schengen Agreements, EU member states are not meant to enforce border crossings but can temporarily intensify border checks with four weeks' notice if they substantiate that such measures will mitigate a genuine security threat. This must be a last resort under the agreement. It appears many European countries now regard this as their final option.

Criminals steal machine guns from IDF troops in northern Israel	3 MAG machine guns stolen from IDF troops near Lebanon border, as criminals increasingly target military weapons; Military Police probe underway Three MAG machine guns were stolen from IDF infantry forces stationed near a village in northern Israel, the military confirmed Monday. The theft occurred last week while the soldiers were taking a break in a designated assembly area near the Lebanon border. The weapons were taken from military vehicles left unattended. The IDF said that the Military Police has launched an investigation, and its findings will be reviewed by the Military Advocate General. 'Naturally, we cannot share details of an ongoing investigation,' the statement added. Local police in Israel’s northern district said they were unaware of the incident. The theft highlights an ongoing issue of military-grade weapons being targeted by criminal organizations. MAG machine guns, which are highly sought after in the criminal underworld, were reportedly valued at up to half a million shekels ($135,000) on the black market before the war. Experts believe prices have since risen. This is not the first instance of weapon theft from military assembly areas. In November last year, grenades, explosives, ammunition and M16 rifles were stolen from IDF positions in the Galilee. The thieves had distributed food and clothing to soldiers as part of a diversion tactic before stealing the weapons. Three suspects, Arab-Israeli residents of nearby villages, were later arrested and charged. In October, shortly after Hamas’ attacks in southern Israel, a MAG machine gun was stolen from soldiers who had left it behind while seeking shelter during a rocket alert in the town of Avdon. In another incident, criminals stole a LAW anti-tank missile from a reservist battalion stationed along the northern border. Police have warned that since the start of the war, criminal groups have increasingly targeted military personnel, exploiting moments of inattention to steal weapons and equipment. Investigations into these incidents are ongoing.

Trump taps oil industry leader as energy secretary	Chris Wright lacks political experience but aligns with Trump's positions, seeking to expand US oil and gas industries despite climate crisis November 2024 marks the hottest on record for eastern U.S. residents in places like New York, Vermont and even Maine, who are experiencing weather that might have been considered fitting for summer just a few decades ago. Meanwhile, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Chris Wright, a senior figure in the oil and gas industry and a climate change skeptic, as his energy secretary. Wright is the founder and CEO of Liberty Energy, a Denver-based drilling company. He is expected to back Trump's agenda to maximize oil and gas production and explore ways to boost electricity output, which is seeing rising demand for the first time in decades. Last year, Wright shared a video on his LinkedIn profile declaring, ' There is no climate crisis, and we’re not in the midst of an energy transition, either.' He labeled climate activists as 'hysterical' and likened Democratic efforts to combat global warming to Soviet-style communism. He has also written extensively about the need for increased fossil fuel production 'to lift people out of poverty.' Wright’s appointment isn’t surprising, as Trump raised hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions from the oil and gas industry and pledged to free it from regulations, despite the U.S. reaching record-high oil production under U.S. President Joe Biden. Though Wright has no political experience, his style aligns with Trump’s. In 2019, he famously drank a liquid used in drilling on camera to prove it wasn’t harmful. He will replace outgoing energy secretary Jennifer Granholm, an advocate for electric vehicles and green energy. Trump also announced that one of his personal attorneys, Will Scharf, will serve as White House chief of staff. Scharf, a former federal prosecutor, was part of Trump’s legal team in his successful bid to secure broad immunity from the Supreme Court. The day after Trump’s victory, Scharf tweeted 'Bye Jack,' referring to special counsel Jack Smith, who is concluding investigations against Trump.

Saudi festival featuring J.Lo criticized amid Gaza war, destructi...	As Gaza war rages, Saudi Arabia's Riyadh Season, spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, comes under fire; performance by Jennifer Lopez in revealing outfit sparks accusations of undermining country's cultural values and sanctity Saudi Arabia hosted the Arab-Islamic Summit last week and has been holding a vastly different event for over a month. On Oct. 12, the kingdom launched 'Riyadh Season,' a massive festival that runs through March 2025. Featuring concerts, cultural shows, fashion events, culinary experiences, and sports activities for all ages, the festival spans multiple zones in Riyadh, each offering attractions such as theme parks, restaurants, exhibitions, and manicured gardens, including a zoo. Launched in 2019, Riyadh Season is part of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, an initiative to diversify the kingdom’s economy by promoting tourism and reducing reliance on oil revenue. Each year, the festival draws millions of visitors. During its first month this year, it has hosted prominent Arab and international celebrities. The festival is spearheaded by Turki Al-Sheikh, chairman of Saudi Arabia’s General Entertainment Authority. While widely praised online, this year’s event has drawn sharp criticism due to ongoing wars in the region and the festival’s content. Critics argue that holding such celebrations amid the prolonged wars in Gaza and Lebanon is tone-deaf. A similar backlash arose during Riyadh Season 2023, which launched last October during the early days of the Israel-Hamas war. Critics used hashtags like 'Gaza is destroyed, Riyadh celebrates' to condemn the festivities. Despite this, last year’s festival reached a record 20 million visitors. This year’s criticism intensified after a fashion show by Lebanese designer Elie Saab, one of the season’s highlights, sparked controversy. Titled '1001 Seasons of Elie Saab,' the show fused modern aesthetics with Arab heritage, drawing inspiration from One Thousand and One Nights. It featured performances by global stars Céline Dion, Camila Cabello, and Jennifer Lopez. Lopez, in particular, faced online backlash for her revealing attire and dance routines, which some argued clashed with Saudi Arabia’s religious character as the 'Land of the Two Holy Mosques.' Critics accused the event of desecrating the kingdom’s sanctity, targeting both Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turki Al-Sheikh for hosting such performances. A user on X (formerly Twitter) shared a video of Camila Cabello from the fashion show, writing: 'Forgive us, Prophet of God, for this video. Forgive us for celebrating Riyadh’s ‘season of porn’ while Gaza fights. Where are Saudi Arabia’s free people to stand up to Turki Al-Sheikh and his thugs?' Another account criticized the event, stating, 'Where are the real stars? In the sky,' referencing the wars in Gaza and Lebanon.

Iran planned to assassinate former Canadian justice minister, rep...	Canadian authorities say foiled plot against human rights and anti-IRGC advocate Irwin Cotler, whose daughter served as a Knesset member in Israel; Tehran denies allegations Canadian authorities foiled an Iranian plot to assassinate Prof. Irwin Cotler, a former Canadian justice minister and the stepfather of former Knesset member Michal Cotler-Wunsh, the Foreign Ministry's special envoy for combating antisemitism and delegitimization. Cotler, who currently chairs the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights and is a vocal critic of Iran, received a warning about an immediate threat to his life on October 26. According to the Globe and Mail, Canadian police identified two suspects in the plot, though no further details about the investigation have been disclosed. The 84-year-old Cotler has been under tight security since the October 7 massacre due to his vocal support for Israel. Serving as Canada’s justice minister from 2003 to 2006, he retired from politics in 2015. His daughter was elected to the Knesset in 2020 as part of the Blue and White party, serving less than a year. Since October 7, Cotler's security has included armored vehicles and an escort of armed officers. However, the alert he received at the end of last month was clear and unambiguous saying his life was in danger and an assassination attempt could be made against him by Iranian agents operating in Canada within 48 hours. While Cotler is accustomed to threats due to his pro-Israel stance, the incident has placed him at the center of an international saga involving terrorism, diplomacy and the ongoing fight for human rights. Since stepping down as justice minister, Cotler has become a prominent figure in combating antisemitism and hate crimes. The Raoul Wallenberg Centre he leads — named after the Swedish diplomat who saved thousands of Jews during the Holocaust — focuses on fighting oppressive regimes and institutionalized violence. Cotler’s activism includes extensive campaigns to designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. These efforts culminated in June when Canada officially classified the IRGC as such — a move that was met with outrage in Tehran. Cotler has also long represented Iranian political prisoners, including prominent activists opposing the Islamic regime. Allegations against the Iranian regime aren’t without precedent, as several Iranian plots to target political leaders and activists worldwide have been uncovered over the past year. Just this month, the U.S. Department of Justice revealed a foiled Iranian plan to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump prior to the elections. Iran’s Foreign Ministry dismissed the allegations, labeling them a 'reprehensible fabrication' attributed to Israel and regime opponents, without providing detailed responses to the claims.

IDF reserve officer flees Cyprus over possible war crimes allegat...	Authorities advise IDF officer to leave Cyprus and return to Israel after pro-Palestinian groups use social media footage from his service in Gaza to request arrest on alleged ‘genocide’ charges An IDF reserve officer who served in Gaza was forced to leave Cyprus and return to Israel over the weekend at the urging of the Foreign and Justice Ministries, fearing that pro-Palestinian organizations in the country might pursue arrest warrants against him for alleged war crimes. The decision followed revelations that the officer had uploaded videos from Gaza to social media over the past year, including footage in which he appeared to boast about his actions. In one video, for instance, he said, 'We're here in Rafah — we won’t stop until we burn all of Gaza.' The reservist, identified as A.L., posted videos documenting his service in Gaza during the war. Last week, he also shared that he and his wife were traveling to Cyprus for a vacation. This announcement became the basis for pro-Palestinian organizations, including the Belgian group March 30, to seek an arrest warrant. The group tracks Israeli soldiers with the intent to prosecute them in Europe for alleged war crimes. The group filed an official complaint with Cypriot authorities accusing the soldier, based on the videos he posted, of war crimes and 'genocide' in Gaza. 'We demand his arrest and investigation,' the group said. Other organizations, such as the Hind Rajab Foundation, joined the complaint and provided links to the reservist’s videos as evidence. Israeli authorities closely monitored the situation. The Foreign Ministry, in coordination with the Justice Ministry and Israel’s embassy in Cyprus, contacted A.L. and advised him to leave the country. Ultimately, it was decided he should return to Israel immediately to avoid potential legal complications. The urgency may have been heightened by an X post from the Hind Rajab Foundation, which read, 'Cyprus has officially opened an investigation into the case and has communicated this to our legal team. This is a step in the right direction. We now hope that Cyprus will stand firm against the inevitable political pressure and hold/interrogate the suspect.' After returning to Israel, A.L. posted on social media: 'We’ll share later what we’ve been through and what a miracle it is that we’re back here, two days earlier than originally planned.' Sources familiar with the case criticized A.L. for acting irresponsibly by posting incriminating footage from his reserve service, reportedly in violation of IDF orders. They also faulted the IDF for failing to enforce stricter guidelines to prevent such posts, which they said expose Israel to legal challenges and harm its international standing.

Hezbollah rocket kills 1, injures 5 in northern Arab town	Emergency services report firefighters rescued woman trapped in apartment hit by rocket, but she later succumbed to her wounds; several others sustained minor injuries in attack A Hezbollah rocket struck the northern Israeli town of Shfar’am on Monday, killing one woman and injuring at least five others, Magen David Adom (MDA) Director Eli Bin reported on Monday. Paramedics rescued the woman from an apartment hit directly by the rocket but were unable to save her despite resuscitation efforts. 'Unfortunately, a woman was killed as a result of a direct hit on a residential building,' said Rami Suwaed, a United Hatzalah paramedic who responded to the scene. 'We also assisted over 20 residents with various injuries, some of whom were evacuated by ambulance.' The IDF reported that approximately five projectiles were launched from Lebanon, with interception attempts made. The IDF confirmed that some projectiles hit Israeli territory. The rocket attack comes as the military intensifies its campaign against Hezbollah strongholds in Beirut, with airstrikes pounding the capital’s Dahieh district. Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper Al-Akhbar reported that damage in Dahieh has reached an estimated $630 million, with rebuilding across Lebanon after Israeli strikes projected to cost $3 billion—matching the toll of the 2006 Second Lebanon War. The ongoing fighting continues against the backdrop of efforts to secure a cease-fire deal in Lebanon mediated by the U.S., to which Israel has agreed. Hezbollah submitted its response to the cease-fire proposal presented by U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, Lebanon's LBCI channel reported late on Sunday. Hochstein is due to arrive in Beirut as early as Tuesday and receive the official Lebanese position.

Ben-Gvir says AG out to get him in alleged ‘criminal scandal'	National security minister claims Gali Baharav-Miara instructed aides to ‘find something’ on him; Smotrich calls for her dismissal over ‘hostile conduct’; Netanyahu, who had previously opposed efforts to remove her, reportedly reconsidering dismissal National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir accused Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara on Monday of orchestrating politically motivated investigations against him, escalating his ongoing clash with the judiciary. Speaking at a meeting of his Otzma Yehudit party, Ben-Gvir claimed to expose a 'serious criminal scandal,' alleging that Baharav-Miara sought to target him for his controversial policy of distributing firearms. According to Ben-Gvir, a deputy in the attorney general’s office visited the police’s Lahav 433 anti-corruption unit months ago to initiate a probe into his firearm distribution initiative. When investigators reportedly found no grounds for an inquiry, Ben-Gvir claimed Baharav-Miara demanded a more aggressive approach, allegedly instructing her deputies to 'find something' against him. The Attorney General denied the accusations, calling them baseless and unsupported by evidence. 'There is no truth to these claims,' Baharav-Miara said in a statement. In a social media post following his remarks, Ben-Gvir challenged Baharav-Miara to take a lie detector test. 'Gali, let’s you and I go to a polygraph,' he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Ben-Gvir accused the attorney general of weaponizing investigations against politicians, alleging that her actions amount to a 'targeted assassination' of his political career. He further claimed she aims to undermine the government and democracy itself, pointing to past investigations of officials close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as evidence. 'She allowed the previous government to do whatever it wanted,' Ben-Gvir said. 'As a government, we have no choice but to dismiss her. She is persecuting us.' Baharav-Miara, who has frequently clashed with Ben-Gvir and other members of Netanyahu’s coalition, has faced repeated calls for her removal amid accusations of overreach. However, her office insists its actions are strictly professional and impartial. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich launched a scathing attack on the attorney general, accusing her of consistently undermining the government’s agenda. 'The hostile conduct led by the attorney general is designed to challenge the government at every turn,' Smotrich said during a Cabinet meeting. He cited an incident where Baharav-Miara opposed a government decision to limit the tenure of legal advisers to seven years—a policy established in 2009. 'As always, she fights decisions to serve her personal interests, protecting her friends and funneling millions of shekels into their pockets at the expense of Israeli citizens,' Smotrich claimed. Smotrich called on Baharav-Miara to resign, accusing her of abusing her authority for political purposes. 'If you have a shred of integrity, step down as attorney general, take off your judicial robes and pursue your political battles in a democratic manner from Kaplan Street,' he said, referring to weekly anti-government protests in Tel Aviv. 'Only then can we prevent the erosion of public trust in the justice system and stop the deepening divide among the people.' A senior government official told Ynet that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had previously resisted efforts to remove Baharav-Miara from her post, may now be reconsidering. 'Something has changed,' the official said. Netanyahu is reportedly emboldened by recent military successes in Gaza and the change of administration in the United States. He also noted the relative calm following the controversial dismissal of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant earlier this month. Advisers close to Netanyahu are urging him to act, describing Baharav-Miara as a 'major obstacle' to advancing key legislation, including proposed laws related to military draft exemptions for ultra-Orthodox men.

Saudi prince's 'genocide' accusation against Israel 'intended to ...	Over-the-top anti-Israel statement' result of Saudi recognition normalization and possible defense treaty with Washington won't be achieved soon due to ongoing war in Gaza and presidential transition in US, security expert says Arab and Muslim leaders concluded a landmark summit in Riyadh last week, where they addressed the pressing issues facing the region, including the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and southern Lebanon and the evolving roles of Iran and the United States following Donald Trump’s recent reelection. In their closing statement, all 57 leaders participating in the Extraordinary Arab and Islamic Summit called for a return to the 1967 borders and unanimously emphasized the importance of establishing a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, despite his country’s ongoing efforts to bridge gaps and pursue normalization with Israel, which has long been a goal of the United States, referred to Israel’s actions in Gaza as a 'collective genocide.' 'The over-the-top anti-Israel statement of the summit was a result of the Saudi recognition that normalization and a possible defense treaty with Washington will not be achieved soon due to the ongoing war in Gaza and the presidential transition in America,' explained John Hannah, senior fellow at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA). 'This rhetoric is functional to placate the public and Iran. These regimes are experts at providing something for public consumption and then doing the exact opposite way later on.' Following the summit, Hamas called on Arab and Muslim nations to translate their pledges into concrete actions, urging immediate efforts to halt Israeli aggression. 'The establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital would require more immediate efforts and practical solutions to force (Israel) to stop its aggression and genocide against our people,' Hamas declared in a statement. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati cautioned that his country is enduring an 'existential' crisis and subtly criticized foreign interference, with an implied reference to Iran. Meanwhile, Israeli officials such as Prime Minister Netanyahu dismissed the idea of a Palestinian state, calling it 'unrealistic.' On Monday, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich went further by pledging to push for annexing parts of the West Bank by 2025, stirring additional controversy. 'These meetings were just another example of trying to whitewash Saudi’s position by talking about Palestinian rights, but in reality, Saudi Arabia has proven to be on Israel’s side, as well as America’s,' argued Hugh Miles, founder of Arab Digest. 'Qatar has stolen the limelight diplomatically over these months, so Saudi Arabia is looking for ways to please Donald Trump and Israel—Saudi shares strong ties with Trump and his family, particularly his son-in-law Kushner. So, the kingdom feels shielded in many ways with this administration,' he added. Saudi Arabia occupies a unique position, balancing its strong ties with the U.S. while simultaneously reopening dialogue with Iran, a nation it has traditionally viewed as a regional threat. 'Saudi Arabia is clearly afraid of Iran, and these meetings are a way to please it somehow and avoid a bigger threat to the country, which could jeopardize the existence of the monarchy directly,' commented Joshua Teitelbaum, professor at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University. 'Iran is in a very powerful position. They can close the Strait of Hormuz and plunge the world economy into crisis with one press of a button. They can also affect Saudi’s economy and even drag the kingdom into a regional war if they want to. Everything is intertwined right now: If Israel somehow loses the war, the Saudi monarchy might not survive either,' added Miles. Despite claims of retaliatory intentions over the past month, Iran has yet to respond directly to Israel, raising questions about its strategic calculus under increasing American pressure in the region. 'No doubt Iranians are nervous and shaken by Trump. The regime is more vulnerable than ever, and its ‘insurance policies’—such as its proxies—have been gradually weakened. The Iranian attacks didn’t manage to damage Israel at all, while Israel succeeded in harming the regime’s air defenses. Even the country’s economy is in shambles, and the regime has lost legitimacy in front of its people. So, of course, from now on, they must be very careful,' concluded Hannah. 'The Arab and Muslim world is winning, while Israel is slowly losing the war, both due to its internal divisions and the impact of BDS and criticism against its war crimes,' Miles concluded. 'The Middle East is about to change drastically, and Zionism could cease to exist in the process.' The story is written by Giorgia Valente and reprinted with permission from The Media Line.

Can war bring security to the north? Ynet's senior defense analys...	Ron Ben Yishai says success of the military's ground offensive to remove an immediate threat from the Galilee is evident, but Israel must insist on extensive authority of the international community to ensure Hezbollah's compliance with terms of the cease-fire While the IDF completes its mission in South Lebanon, assigned to it by the government, and amid advanced negotiations for a cease-fire that would end the war in the north and allow residents evacuated from their homes to return after more than a year, and allow rebuilding of destroyed communities to begin, questions mount about what the day after the war will look like. 'Before traveling to Washington and Moscow, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer should have come here to see the reality on the ground, Metula Mayor David Azulay said recently. Ynet's senior defense analyst Ron Ben Yishai says the IDF has been removing roadblocks that prevented civilians from approaching areas near the border, that were under Hezbollah anti-tank missile fire. This, he explains, indicates the military's operations in South Lebanon have been successful in removing the immediate threat. The IDF has neutralized most of Hezbollah's armaments but, more than that, the troops have prevented the flow of arms to the south. What remains a problem is Hezbollah's use of attack drones. Ben Yishai says Israel is under attack from Lebanon but also Iraq and Yemen. Those drones can be intercepted because they are detected early and are intercepted away from Israel's borders, but the drones launched from within Lebanon are more of a challenge. Even when a drone launch is detected and followed as it makes its way through Israeli territory, there is a risk of shooting it down over populated areas because of the explosives it carries. The cease-fire agreement nearing its final stages, that would end the fighting in Lebanon, is a good one, according to Ben Yishai. But Israel must insist that an international commission is set up to oversee the implementation of the cease-fire terms. If such a commission is given the proper authority, there is no need to insist on written assurances from the U.S. that the IDF would have the freedom to operate against Hezbollah if the need arises. Ben Yishai criticized the new defense minister for his lack of understanding of the current situation after Israel Katz announced that elimination of Hezbollah is one of the objectives of the war. 'What he should have said was that Israel must demand that Hezbollah is relieved of its heavy weapons south of the Litani River,' according to Ben Yishai. He said when Lebanese villagers return to the south, Hezbollah operatives, many who are themselves residents of those villages, will return with them. What must be prevented is Hezbollah's ability to rebuild its infrastructure under the homes in those villages. The IDF operation caused the destruction of over 60% of the homes in the villages because they were used as launch pads for attack or had tunnels and fortifications build bellow them where Hezbollah sored their massive arsenal or rockets and missiles.

This is Iran's next supreme leader, Ali Kamenei's 2nd son	Reports from Tehran suggest that Mojtaba Khamenei, the second son of Iran’s current supreme leader, was secretly chosen to succeed his father following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi, previously considered the frontrunner Mojtaba Khamenei, 55, the second son of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has reportedly been secretly chosen as his father’s successor, according to a report by opposition-affiliated news outlet Iran International. The report published on Sunday suggests Mojtaba could assume the role even before his 85-year-old father’s death, as the elder Khamenei is rumored to be gravely ill. The supreme leader is traditionally selected by the Assembly of Experts, an 88-member clerical body elected every eight years by the public but vetted by the Guardian Council, whose members are directly or indirectly appointed by the supreme leader. Speculation over Khamenei’s successor intensified in May after a helicopter crash involving former President Ebrahim Raisi, who had been considered the frontrunner for the role. While Raisi had not denied ambitions for the position, the crash is believed to have altered the political landscape. A powerful but controversial figure Mojtaba Khamenei, a cleric like his father, was born in Mashhad and is married with two children. He is a shadowy figure with significant influence among his father’s loyalists. Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the family moved to Tehran, where Mojtaba attended a high school for children of the leaders of the revolution. His father’s political rise culminated in his presidency in 1981. Mojtaba served in the Iran-Iraq War during the 1980s, forging ties with individuals who would later become prominent figures in Iran’s security apparatus, including Hossein Taeb, a senior official in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Over the years, Mojtaba has drawn international attention. In 2019, the United States accused him of collaborating closely with the IRGC and the Basij, a paramilitary volunteer force under the IRGC, to further his father’s destabilizing regional ambitions. Domestically, Mojtaba has faced allegations of suppressing dissent. In 2009, he backed Taeb, then the Basij commander, in the violent crackdown on Green Movement protesters. He was also targeted by demonstrators during the protests sparked by the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, who died in custody after being detained by the morality police for allegedly failing to properly wear her hijab. Critics in Iran argue that Mojtaba lacks the religious credentials and managerial experience to succeed his father. Some clerics and commentators have dismissed the idea of dynastic succession as un-Islamic, likening it to monarchy. While Mojtaba is seen as a leading candidate, other figures have been mentioned as possible successors, including cleric and politician Mohammad Mehdi Mirbagheri and cleric Ali Reza Arafi. Former President Hassan Rouhani and Sadeq Larijani, the former judiciary chief, have also been named as having ambitions for the role. The reliability of the Iran International report is unclear. The outlet, which broadcasts in Persian and has ties to Saudi Arabia and Iranian opposition groups, often focuses on anti-regime narratives. However, the secrecy surrounding succession planning in Tehran makes the situation opaque. Analysts suggest the IRGC will likely work to block any candidate it deems unsuitable.

Palestinian NGO to ask UK court to block sending F-35 parts to Is...	Britain is allowing parts for F-35 fighter jets to be exported to Israel even though they could be used in breach of international humanitarian law in Gaza, lawyers for a Palestinian rights group told a London court on Monday. West Bank-based Al-Haq, which documents alleged rights violations by Israel and the Palestinian Authority, is taking legal action against Britain's Department for Business and Trade at London's High Court. Al-Haq's case comes after Britain in September suspended 30 of 350 arms export licenses, though it exempted the indirect export of F-35 parts, citing the impact on the global F-35 program. Al-Haq argues that decision was unlawful as there is a clear risk F-35s could be used in breach of international humanitarian law. A full hearing of Al-Haq's legal challenge is likely to be heard early in 2025.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj4ssn00m1g	2024-11-18T03:39:34-08:00

Hezbollah demands changes to proposed cease-fire deal	Terror group rejects terms including German, UK participation in commission overseeing implementation of agreement; Lebanese outlet opposing Hezbollah says commission to have vast authority over Lebanon's airport, sea ports and borders Hezbollah is demanding modifications to the cease-fire agreement being negotiated by U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein, local media reported on Monday. According to the Hezbollah-affiliated al Akhbar newspaper, the Iran-backed terror group submitted its response to the proposal to Lebanon's Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and care-taker Prime Minister Najib Mikati. The newspaper claimed Israel was hoping that Hezbollah would reject the deal so that the war could continue. Sources told al Akhbar that the wording of the Lebanese response to Hochstein is nearing completion and will be delivered to the American embassy in Beirut ahead of the envoy's expected arrival on Tuesday. 'The positive ambiguity is Lebanon's way to deal with the American proposal,' sources reportedly said. The questions that were expected to upend the negotiations were resolved and there is a wide birth left. 'The negotiations became serious and Netanyahu was under doubled pressure to stop the fighting,' according to the report. Political sources told the publication that Hezbollah's response was in line with the 2006 UN resolution 1701 and that Hochstein will not announce an agreement during his visit and will only relay the Lebanese response to the Israelis. But officials in Lebanon believe that even if a deal can be agreed, there would be difficulties in implementing it. Hezbollah rejected the participation of Germany and the UK in the committee overseeing the implementation of the cease-fire deal but agreed to American and French involvement. 'This is a critical week, there will either be a cease-fire agreement within days or the fighting would continue until mid-January,' the officials said, referring to the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Western officials said they believe the 'positive openness in Lebanon will help pressure Israel to implement the deal.' According to the Lebanese daily Nidaa al-Watan (Call of the Nation), which does not support Hezbollah, the pending deal delivered to Lebanon includes: • The establishment of an international commission to oversee the implementation of UN resolution 1701, headed by an American general and with the participation of a French general. • The demolition of Hezbollah military structures north and south of the Litani River. • Preserving Israel's right to intervene in case of violations of the agreement that cannot be resolved in negotiations. • Implementation of the deal either through dialogue or through force. The newspaper also reported Berri's response may not be a resounding yes or no, which would not be enough for the Americans or the Israelis, who insist on a positive Lebanese response, and that even if a cease-fire is agreed upon, there would be complications as a result of the agreement and the difficulties would continue. The Al Joumhouria newspaper, which opposes Hezbollah, revealed more information about the proposed deal than previously reported, including a Hezbollah withdrawal north of the Litani while the IDF would withdraw its troops from south Lebanese villages, the return of displaced civilians on both sides of the border and the strengthening of peacekeeping forces and the Lebanese army. The newspaper also reported the establishment of an international commission but said that, in addition to the U.S., France and the UK, an unnamed Arab country also would participate. The commission's authorities will be vast and will include oversight of strategic instillations in Lebanon, including the international airport, the ports and border crossings. The newspaper raises the question of whether the agreement could be reached before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump assumes office, or if there is a risk of a dangerous escalation in the war. It also reports that the initial Lebanese response was already delivered but more comments would be added.

Faith meets diplomacy in Portugal with new Israel Allies Caucus	Madelena Barata: ‘The Jewish people will no longer tolerate being the scapegoat of humanity’ The Portugal Parliamentary Israel Allies Caucus launched on Monday, according to the Israel Allies Foundation (IAF). This is the organization’s 54th pro-Israel parliamentary caucus worldwide. 'The Jewish people will no longer tolerate being the scapegoat of humanity, targeted as a lightning rod for social frustration. Israel stands as the guarantor that no Jew will ever be without defense or a home,' said Madelena Barata, director of the new caucus. 'That's why it's crucial to build networks that support and protect Israel. It is especially significant that the IAF is now active in Portugal, further strengthening this global effort.' These caucuses primarily focus on faith-based diplomacy, engaging Christians and others who support Israel for religious reasons. The Portugal caucus will be bipartisan, led by representatives from two major political parties: Liana Reis of the Social Democratic Party, and Pedra Frazão of the Chega Party. Frazão emphasized Portugal’s support for the Jewish people. 'As a sovereign state, Israel ensures that no Jewish person will be left unprotected or without a homeland,' Frazão said. 'Israel's existence is a deliberate choice, embodying the strength and resilience of the Jewish people and their right to self-defense. This is not just symbolic—it is a steadfast promise to protect every Jew's right to live in peace and security.' MK Sharren Haskel, co-chair of the Knesset Christian Allies Caucus and now Deputy Foreign Minister, attended the caucus launch event in Lisbon. She remarked, 'I view interpersonal diplomacy as a critical tool for building global support for Israel. 'By attending the launch of the Portugal Israel Allies Caucus in Lisbon, we are sending a powerful message of solidarity between our nations,' she continued. 'At a time when support for Israel is more vital than ever, this initiative broadcasts the voices of parliamentarians who stand with Israel. I look forward to thanking the members of the caucus for their commitment to strengthening our bilateral relationship, reinforcing our shared values, and contributing to Israel’s security.' The network of allied caucuses began in 2004 with the Knesset Christian Allies Caucus and expanded in 2006 when the U.S. Congress launched its bipartisan Congressional Israel Allies Caucus, now the largest of its kind. Today, the network spans parliaments on six continents, offering a powerful platform to strengthen ties with Israel. 'IAF Europe is evolving into a movement, acting as a diplomatic 'Iron Dome' protecting Israel from international lawfare,' said Leo van Doesburg, executive director of IAF Europe. 'Our mission is to shift politicians from anti-Israel rhetoric to fact-based dialogue. With our 20th European caucus now in Portugal, we expand our reach across Europe and look forward to strengthening partnerships.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1vvwk00zjx	2024-11-18T00:07:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/18/SJQvmtuMyg/SJQvmtuMyg_92_0_1443_812_0_small.jpg

Iranians divided on election of Donald Trump	Tamar Eilam Gindin: ‘On the one hand, they are afraid of Trump. On the other hand, there is a lot of happiness.’ Iranians are divided over whether the election of U.S. President Donald Trump will be beneficial or detrimental to them. 'On the one hand, they are afraid of Trump,' explained Tamar Eilam Gindin, an Iran specialist at the University of Haifa. 'On the other hand, there is a lot of happiness on social media.' Gindin noted that it’s unclear how much of the optimism comes from Iranians living inside the country versus those living abroad, but she believes there is genuine hope among some Iranians. Khamenei’s Health: Rumors Resurface Gindin also addressed reports about Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's health during an interview with ILTV News on Sunday. She urged caution regarding unverified claims that Khamenei is in a coma or on his deathbed. Fresh rumors about Khamenei’s deteriorating health and the potential transfer of power to his son, Mojtaba Khamenei, last surfaced in early December 2020. As in the past, these claims were quickly denied and ultimately proved untrue. These rumors often originate from a single source that is quick to release scoops but slow to verify them, Gindin told ILTV News, adding that speculation is growing but remains unconfirmed. 'It’s not the first time we’ve heard these rumors. I would not rejoice or worry until we have confirmed reports,' she emphasized. Who Will Succeed Khamenei? If the rumors about Khamenei's health turn out to be true, the question of succession looms large. While many online speculate that Mojtaba Khamenei is the likely successor, Gindin urged caution here as well. She explained that a team of 88 experts, known as the Assembly of Experts, is responsible for selecting the next Supreme Leader. Their meetings and decisions are highly secretive, meaning it is entirely possible that someone else could emerge as the leader.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjlvkk00myg	2024-11-17T23:54:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2020/07/14/r1aMsEiyv/r1aMsEiyv_0_0_640_360_0_small.jpg
Russian former spy warns 'start of WWIII' coming	Maria Butina, now a politician, says she hopes Trump will reverse Biden administration decision to allow Ukraine to use American missiles to attack deep inside Russian territory; 'I guess there are some people in the US who have nothing to lose, don't care' Russian lawmaker and former spy Maria Butina said on Monday that the administration of President Joe Biden was risking World War III if it had allowed Ukraine to use U.S.-made weapons to strike deep into Russia. 'These guys, Biden’s administration, is trying to escalate the situation to the maximum while they still have power and are still in office,' Butina said. 'I have a great hope that (President-elect Donald) Trump will overcome this decision if this has been made because they are seriously risking the start of World War III which is not in anybody’s interest,' she told Reuters. The New York Times reported on Sunday that the Biden administration has made the decision to allow Ukraine to use U.S. weapons to strike deep into Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on September 12 that Western approval for such a step would mean 'the 'direct involvement' of NATO countries, the United States and European countries in the war in Ukraine' because NATO military infrastructure and personnel would have to be involved in the targeting and firing of the missiles. In late October, Putin said that Russia’s defense ministry was working on different ways to respond if the United States and its NATO allies help Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with long-range Western missiles. 'I guess there are some people in the United States who have nothing to lose for whatever reason or who are completely off the grid so much that they simply do not care,' Butina, who spent 15 months in U.S. prison for acting as an unregistered Russian agent, said. Donald Trump Jr., the son of president-elect Trump said in a post on X that the American 'military industrial complex' hoped to start WWIII before his father took office and had the chance to bring world peace. Leonid Eduardovich Slutsky, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Russia's lower house, the Duma, said late on Monday that the American approval of Ukraine's use of the ATACMS missiles to attack deep in Russian territory will result in a severe response and will 'lead to an inevitable escalation that will have a threat of far greater implications.'

Iran backs Lebanon’s decision to secure ceasefire with Israel	Ali Larijani: ‘We support the Resistance (axis) under all circumstances’ Iran has expressed its support for any decision taken by Lebanon to secure a ceasefire with Israel. This was conveyed by Ali Larijani, a senior advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, during a visit to Damascus. Larijani emphasized Tehran's desire to see an end to a conflict that has inflicted significant damage on Hezbollah, Iran's key ally in Lebanon. 'We are not seeking to disrupt anything. We are seeking to resolve issues,' said Ali Larijani, a senior Iranian official. 'Under all circumstances, we stand in support of the people of Lebanon. 'Those who create disruption are [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and those like him. Let us recognize our friends and enemies,' he continued. 'Hezbollah is a wise movement, and the people of Lebanon are also a wise nation. They know what they are doing. 'We support the Resistance (axis) under all circumstances, but they themselves know what actions they need to take,' he concluded. Israeli Strikes Reportedly Hit Iranian Nuclear Facility Meanwhile, Axios has reported that the Israeli Air Force targeted a secret Iranian nuclear research facility during extensive airstrikes last month. Citing current and former U.S. and Israeli officials, the report claims the strikes dealt a significant blow to Iran’s nuclear program. The Parchin military complex, located about 20 kilometers southeast of Tehran, was reportedly the target. This site is believed to have been used for testing explosives necessary to trigger a nuclear device. Iran’s Delayed Retaliation and Khamenei’s Health Concerns Iran has indicated that it will delay its promised retaliation against Israel until after the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in January. Despite the delay, Tehran has vowed that an attack will occur. Over the weekend, the Islamic regime unveiled some of its latest missile and air defense systems. Adding to the tension, unconfirmed social media reports surfaced over the weekend claiming that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's 85-year-old Supreme Leader, is in a coma following a serious illness. Three weeks ago, The New York Times reported that Khamenei was gravely ill, suggesting a succession battle is underway in Tehran. However, no official confirmation has been released regarding the Ayatollah's health. Khamenei was last seen publicly on November 7.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h188addz1g	2024-11-17T23:46:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/14/HJmvKgtUT/HJmvKgtUT_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Families of U.S. victims of Hamas massacre sue Iran	Forty-six American citizens, including children, were killed on October 7, 2023 and 12 others, both living and dead, are still held in Gaza; Lawsuit filed in US District Court cites Hamas documents discovered in Gaza Families of victims of the Hamas massacre on October 7 who hold American citizenship are suing Iran for it part in supporting the deadly attack on Israel. The victims include those who were killed, injured or suffered mental anguish due to the massacre. The lawsuit, filed on Sunday in U.S. District Court in Washington, seeks compensatory damages under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Anti-Terrorism Act, the New York Times reported. It names Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , which all appear on the U.S. list of designated foreign terrorist organizations. Forty-six American citizens, including children, were killed on October 7, 2023. Some 12 Americans were also among the 250 people taken hostage by Hamas. Seven of them still remain in captivity, at least thee who are believed to be dead. More than 30 American Israeli citizens serving in the IDF have been killed in Gaza, and some of their families also are parties to the lawsuit. The lawsuit cites Hamas documents discovered in Gaza, as well as documents obtained by the Americans' lawyers regarding a secret meeting of Hamas leaders in December 2022m, in which Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar requests an additional $7 million a month from the Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps for the 'big project,' referring to the October 7 attack, according to the New York Times, which reviewed the documents. The lawsuit was filed by several lawyers, including Lee Wolosky, and Gary M. Osen, who once represented Nazi victims. Lawsuits are frequently filed against Iran in U.S. courts, and the cases are often won via default judgements.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syvujdumje	2024-11-17T23:18:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/21/H1C9Jlfwa/H1C9Jlfwa_0_216_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham in region to jumpstart Saudi norma...	Graham expected to travel to Riyadh after meeting in Israel with Netanyahu and other officials; Says establishing Saudi-Israel ties vital to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham arrived in Israel for talks with officials. Graham, a close ally of president-elect Donald Trump, plans to travel to Saudi Arabia later as part of his tour of the region. The senator, who touched down in Israel over the weekend, hopes to restart negotiations for a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel that has stalled after the October 7 massacre and the ensuing war, even before Trump takes office, to ensure a two-thirds Senate majority to pass the U.S.-Saudi defense pact. Graham met with former defense minister Yoav Gallant and the two discussed the threat from Iran and normalization with Riyadh. 'It was an important meeting,' Gallant said. 'Lindsey Gram is a true friend and avid supporter of Israel who invests many efforts to strengthen Israel's regional position and bolster its security amid threats primarily from Iran. We discussed the vital need to use the short window of opportunity that has opened for forging agreements that would strengthen Israel and weaken Iran and help reach a path that will enable the return of the hostages held captive by Hamas in Gaza.' Graham met earlier with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Expressing his concern about Iran's breakthrough to nuclear capability, Graham told the prime minister: 'Do whatever you must to prevent the Iranian ayatollahs from obtaining nuclear weapons,' the Prime Minister's office (PMO) reported after the meeting. In Graham's view 'an Iranian ayatollah armed with nuclear weapons is an existential threat to Israel and a nightmare for the world. They consistently refer to the United States as the 'big Satan.' It is in the interest of the U.S. to ensure the Iranian regime does not possess nuclear weapons. This is a critical and dangerous time for our friends in Israel and in the entire world. It is vital for the United States to be seen and heard having Israel's back amid the threats from Iran.'

Lebanon agrees to US cease-fire proposal, says Hezbollah submits ...	Lebanese media says Beirut's response, to be delivered to U. S. envoy Amos Hochstein, will include demands for changes and clarification on American assurances to Israel that it can operate against Hezbollah violations of the deal Hezbollah submitted its response to the cease-fire proposal presented by U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein Lebanon's LBCI channel reported late on Sunday. Hochstein is due to arrive in Beirut as early as Tuesday and receive the official Lebanese position. According to the report, Beirut accepts the outline of the deal but will introduce changes and demand clarifications regarding U.S. assurance to Israel that the IDF would be able to operate in Lebanon should the terms of the cease-fire agreement be violated. Beirut rejects any Israeli operations on its territory. Israel requested a letter from the U.S. ensuring freedom of action against Hezbollah if the Lebanese army or the peacekeeping force that would be deployed to the south fail to respond. If there is progress on an agreement, Hochstein is expected to travel to Israel after his visit to Beirut. According to senior officials who were privy to details of the negotiations, Iran was not expected to prevent Lebanon from agreeing to the cease-fire. 'Iran wants to calm things down. They are playing the long game. To them, there is no problem reaching a deal,' the officials said. Saudi Arabia's Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper cited sources in Lebanon who said that the speaker of parliament, Nabih Berri, kept in touch with Hochstein and his team. 'There is serious concern that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will ultimately reject the deal.' Israel has increased its attacks on Beirut, and on Sunday conducted attacks strikes outside the Dahieh neighborhood, Hezbollah's stronghold in the city. An Israeli official said the attacks are 'a symptom of attempts to finalize the deal.' The IDF confirmed on Monday that it targeted Hezbollah's spokesperson Mohammad Afif. Lebanese media said the target of a later attack was a senior Hezbollah commander of South Lebanon.

Israeli security chiefs warn hostages fate sealed if deal not mad...	Shin, Bet, Mossad, IDF heads say without Israeli concessions talks of a deal cannot restart; Netanyahu summons ministers including far-right opponents of any deal that would end the war, for consultations Israel's top security officials believe there is a need for flexibility in Israel's positions on a possible withdrawal of troops from Gaza and an end to the war, if a hostage deal is to be achieved. Israel has been attempting to re-start negotiations after they have been stalled and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is summoning a consultation on the matter with members of his cabinet including Defense Minister Israel Katz, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. The last two have been vocal opponents of any deal that would end the war and have threatened to bring down the government if one was made. The security officials estimate that of the 101 hostages held in Gaza for over 400 days, only 51 are still alive. They advised the prime minister that if there would be no Israeli concessions, there would be no deal to release them, leaving them to their fate. The renewed efforts come most likely, as winter approached and amid fears that more hostages will die in the tunnels. The efforts are also as the result of regional developments and the election of Donald Trump for a second term as president of the United States. The security chiefs met in the office of the head of Shin Bet Ronen Bar and included Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Mossad Chief Ronen Bar. They also met with Defense Minister Israel Katz and reviewed all available options to restart talks. Israel must first decide its position understanding that Hamas will not agree to a deal that would not end the war and include a full withdrawal of troops. Although Qatar announced it was backing away from mediating between Israel and Hamas, it is still involved behind the scene. Egypt is also actively involved and Israel would have to decide whether to allow Turkey to also be involved in the talks. 1. 2. 3.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1hq11yum1l	2024-11-17T12:42:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/17/rJLjGaDGJl/rJLjGaDGJl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Beirut attack sparks chaos as Israeli missiles hit key targets	Israeli missile attack in Beirut targets vehicle and building, reportedly killing Jamaa Islamiya's Secretary-General and Hezbollah commander; Casualties rise to two dead and 13 injured, prompting school closures Saudi television channel 'Al-Hadath' reported that Israel conducted an attack in Beirut using two missiles, which targeted a vehicle and a building, according to the Lebanese network 'Al-Mayadeen,' affiliated with Hezbollah. In the aftermath, Radio 'Voice of Lebanon' suggested the intended target was likely Mohammad Takoush, the Secretary-General of the terrorist group Jamaa Islamiya. However, this claim was not corroborated by other media outlets. The terrorist organization, according to the Saudi network 'Al-Arabiya,' denied any attack on its center. Meanwhile, the Lebanese channel 'Al-Jadid' said the explosions were due to batteries and electronic devices detonating in a local shop. Initially, the Lebanese Ministry of Health reported one fatality and nine wounded. Separately, 'Al-Hadath' cited sources indicating the attack targeted a 'military commander in Hezbollah.' Subsequent updates from the Ministry revised the toll to two dead and 13 wounded. In response to the attack and amid reports of a high-ranking Hezbollah official's assassination, Lebanon's Minister of Education, Abbas Al-Halabi, announced the closure of educational institutions in several areas throughout the country.

How Netanyahu aid leaked misinformation in security breach	Court lifts ban on suspicions of prime minister's aid and spokesperson's use of classified documents obtained illegally, leaked to German Bild to sway public opinion, while endangering security The magistrate court in Rison Letzion on Sunday lifted some of the gag order on the case involving a possible security breach by a close aid to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Eli Feldstein, who was Netanyahu's liaison to military security reporters was in custody for the past three weeks, suspected of leaking classified documents to foreign media outlets, in a misleading way and endangering national security. Although he was not given security clearance, Feldstein accompanied Netanyahu on visits to sensitive security facilities during the war, including the Air Force command bunker at the IDF’s Tel Aviv military headquarters and was even exposed to classified transcripts from meetings held by the Security Cabinet. According to court filings, in April a reserve soldier serving in a secret intelligence unit gave Feldstein a copy of a classified document via social media, 'so that it would reach the prime minister and assist him in making the right decisions for the hostages.' On August 31, six hostages were executed by Hamas in a tunnel in Rafah. They were Hirsh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Almog Sarusi, Carmel Gat and Alex Lubanov. The brutal murder causd outrage in Israel and prompted a wave of protest against the government and Netanyahu for failing to secure the release of hostages in a deal with Hamas and saving at least some who were to be released in the first phase of the deal that was being negotiated at the time. Therefore, early in September, Feldstein decided to release the document to the Israeli media in order to sway public opinion and portray the protests of the families of hostages, against the government, that had been taking place for the past year, as bolstering Hamas and its leader Yahya Sinwar. Feldstein approached a number of Israeli media outlets. One reporter submitted the document to the military censor who banned its publication. Feldstein then decided to bypass the censor and gave the document to the foreign media. He was assisted by another person to bring the document to publication in the German Bild newspaper. At the same time, he informed Israeli journalists that the story will be published as asked them to do a follow-up report. On September 6 the Bild published a report dealing with the Hamas positions in negotiations to free the hostages, and used documents obtained illegally from IDF intelligence. A few days later, the military launched an investigation into the leak of documents, at the request of Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi. The military found that a document that was sensitive and classified as 'top secret,' was leaked and its publication, the investigators said could harm efforts to achieve the release of hostages which is one of the objectives of the war and could damage IDF and Shin Bet operations in Gaza. Feldstein who saw that the validity of the report in the Bild was under question, met the reserve soldier in the intelligence unit and received a hardcopy of the document and two other documents classified as 'top secret.' One of the documents dealt with 'unusual actions by players in the region at time of war, that could be suspected as targeting Israel.' A joint IDF and Shin Bet investigation led to the leaks being stopped and prevented damage to Israel's security. After the source of the leak was found, further intelligence gathered by investigators, strengthened suspicions against others who were involved. The reserve soldier, two officers and a non-commissioned officer along with Feldstein were arrested late in October and the investigation became public knowledge Netanyahu who at first denied Feldstein was part of the Prime Minister's office later criticized the Shin Bet and the police for mistreating Feldstein and the other suspects who were prevented from seeing council in the fist weeks of their detention. His son Yair, who is active on social media even accused the Shin Bet of staging a coup against his father.

Biden allows Ukraine to use US arms to strike inside Russia	Russia warns move would be seen as a major escalation after deploying North Korean troops; strategic decision may bolster Ukraine's position as Russian forces advance, though future US policy under Trump remains uncertain President Joe Biden's administration will allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided weapons to strike deep into Russian territory, three sources familiar with the matter said, in a significant change to Washington's policy in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Ukraine plans to conduct its first long-range attacks in the coming days, the sources said, without revealing details due to operational security concerns. The White House declined to comment. The move by the United States two months before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20 follows months of requests by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to allow Ukraine's military to use U.S. weapons to hit Russian military targets far from its border. The change follows Russia's deployment of North Korean ground troops to supplement its own forces, a development that has caused alarm in Washington and Kyiv. The first deep strikes are likely to be carried out using ATACMS rockets, which have a range of up to 190 miles (306 km), according to the sources. While some U.S. officials have expressed skepticism that allowing long-range strikes will change the war's overall trajectory, the decision could help Ukraine at a moment when Russian forces are making gains and possibly put Kyiv in a better negotiating position when and if ceasefire talks happen. It is not clear if Trump will reverse Biden's decision when he takes office. Trump has long criticized the scale of U.S. financial and military aid to Ukraine and has vowed to end the war quickly, without explaining how. Still, some congressional Republicans have urged Biden to loosen the rules on how Ukraine can use U.S.-provided weapons. Russia has warned that it would see a move to loosen the limits on Ukraine's use of U.S. weapons as a major escalation.

Mother shielding her baby: Harrowing brutality in Jaffa light-rai...	Prosecutors reveal account of deadly terror attack on Jaffa light rail, where seven were murdered; indictment exposes the calculated cruelty targeting innocent civilians, including a mother sacrificing herself shielding her baby from gunfire An indictment was handed down on Sunday against Ahmad Himuni, a 25-year-old from Hebron, for his role in the deadly attack at the Jaffa light rail station on October 1, where seven people were killed. Muhammad Mask another terrorist was killed on the scene. The indictment details 'particular cruelty' on Himuni's part, who used a knife to stab passengers and bystanders, while Mask, who was neutralized, opened fire with an M-16 assault rifle. The victims in the attack which coincided with Iran's ballistic missile assault, were Ionas Karussis (26), Inbar Segev-Vigder (33), who was shot dead while protecting her baby, Ilia Nozadze (42), Nadia Kosolenko (40), Shahar Goldman (30), Victor Shimshon Green (33), and Revital Bronstein (24). Eleven others were injured. Mask, the 19-year-old terrorist, used a standard rifle in the attack and was neutralized by a passerby, while Himuni was injured and subdued. The Jenin Brigade's refusal and infiltration with a Hebrew-Labeled bag The indictment, filed by attorneys Asaf Shavit and Ori Goldstein from the Tel Aviv District Attorney's Office, charges Himuni with seven counts of aggravated murder as a terrorist act in concert and 12 counts of attempted murder as a terrorist act in concert, along with illegal entry into Israel and weapons transport for terrorist purposes. According to the indictment, Himuni conspired with Mask to carry out terrorist attacks in Israel, motivated by nationalist-ideological reasons, possibly as retaliation for the war in Gaza. As part of their plan, the two terrorists attempted to join the 'Jenin Brigades' to receive weapons and guidance on carrying out terrorist acts against Israeli targets. However, they were told that due to military pressure, this was not possible at the time and that contact would be made after Israeli forces left Jenin. The indictment names two additional terrorists, Abd al-Rahim Afif Jodat Himuni and Ahmad Rafiq Muhammad Himuni, who were in contact with both terrorists and sought to join them in the Jenin Brigade. According to the indictment, the two were informed by Himuni and Mask of their original plan—to carry out a mass-casualty attack in a crowded location such as a football stadium. The agreement among the four was to head to Tel Aviv-Jaffa, with each armed with a firearm. Days before the attack, Mask informed the others (Afif and Rafiq) of his ability to purchase an M-16 rifle, and they helped him financially to acquire the weapon. On September 30, the day before the attack, Mask bought the rifle from an unidentified individual, and when he offered Afif and Rafiq to join the attack armed only with knives, they refused, stating they would participate once they obtained firearms. The Trip to Bloomfield and the altered Plan Himuni agreed to join Mask, armed with a knife, and they infiltrated Israel on the day of the attack. They used the transportation services of other drivers who have already been indicted, carrying a backpack with Hebrew writing containing the disassembled weapon and magazines, along with a pouch (a small bag attached to the belt) with two knives and bullets for the weapon. According to the indictment, upon arriving near Bloomfield Stadium, the terrorists asked a taxi driver who brought them there if a football game was scheduled for that evening. The taxi driver replied that due to the war and the expected Iranian missile attack that evening, no game would take place. The indictment states that around 5:30 PM, the terrorists arrived at Hever HaLeumim Street and stayed briefly in a garage. During this time, Himuni wrote a will on his mobile phone, assuming he would die in the attack. Around 6:30 PM, the terrorists left the garage with their bags and walked toward Jerusalem Boulevard, intending to carry out the attack, where they entered a mosque and prayed. After finishing the prayer, they assembled the weapon in the mosque's purification room, took the knives from the pouch—Himuni holding one in his hands and Mask holding another. Mask then stood at the entrance to the mosque's prayer hall, with Himuni beside him, shouting to the worshippers not to leave the mosque or they would be harmed. Shortly after, around 7:00 PM, the terrorists noticed the light rail arriving at the boulevard and ran from the mosque entrance toward the platform—Mask with the weapon and Himuni with the knife. When the train stopped at the platform, Mask began shooting at dozens present, first on the platform and then inside one of the cars, while Himuni simultaneously stabbed some of the victims. 'The terrorists acted with particular cruelty, seeing the place was crowded with people, including the elderly, women, and children (some toddlers),' the indictment states, 'despite the cries of the minors, who saw the severe injuries inflicted on their mother by the gunfire as she protected them during the shooting.' Upon entering one of the cars, the terrorists noticed Inbar Segev-Vigder, who was protecting her nine-month-old son, strapped to her in a carrier. 'Despite this, the terrorists shot her in cold blood,' the indictment states, noting the indiscriminate nature of their shooting. Bystander's heroism During the shooting, the rifle jammed, and the terrorists entered a barbershop on the street, where Mask cleared the rifle. 'The defendant noticed a person and asked if he was Jewish or Arab, and when he replied that he was Arab, he was allowed to escape. After clearing the rifle, the two returned toward the light rail, which began moving from the platform, and Mask resumed shooting into it through its windows with Himuni beside him. These shots hit passengers in the car and posed a real danger to the lives of additional people beyond those injured,' the indictment states. Further described, the two terrorists noticed a person on an electric scooter and demanded he identify as Jewish or Arab. When he did not respond, Himuni attempted to murder him, stabbing him twice in the back and waist. The indictment emphasizes that the terrorist did this because of the victim's Judaism—who started running and managed to escape. At this point, an armed passerby noticed them, and according to the indictment, Himuni attempted to stab him as well—but he managed to shoot and neutralize him, while others neutralized the terrorist Mask. Today's indictment joins a precedent-setting case filed about two weeks ago against Muhammad Abed al-Nabi (31), owner of 'Hamudi Transport' Ltd. in East Jerusalem, who instructed his drivers to transport illegal infiltrators into Israel during the war. 'Due to his gross negligence, the two terrorists infiltrated the country,' it was reported. Additionally, an indictment was filed against two drivers, Kazem Muzafer (31) and Yazan Nashashibi (35), who transported the terrorists to carry out the attack, charging them with seven counts of negligent homicide and serious injury offenses. These three defendants are also charged with transporting foreign residents under aggravated circumstances in concert. The prosecution requested the court to order the detention of the terrorist and the three additional defendants involved in the attack until the end of legal proceedings against them. In the detention request, the prosecution emphasized that 'this is a bloodthirsty terrorist who murdered young people for nationalist reasons, including a mother protecting her infant on the train. With a rifle and a knife, he slaughtered innocent, defenseless civilians until he was neutralized on the scene.'

Hochstein to return to region to advance cease-fire deal, report	The U.S. envoy is expected in Beirut on Tuesday to receive Lebanon's response and deliver it to Israel, according to reports in Saudi press; Sources tell outlet expectations are not high and Iran has yet to weigh in U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein is expected to return to the region on Tuesday for meetings in Beirut, after Hezbollah responded to the proposed cease-fire agreement presented to the Lebanese government last week. According to the Saudi Al Hadath channel, Hochstein will deliver the response to Israeli officials. The outlet said that expectations that a deal to end the fighting and return residents of Israel's north to their homes, are low because the official Lebanese response does not have the blessing of Iran. 'The wording of the cease-fire agreement is good but indicates that Israel emerges victorious and that will not be accepted. According to Hezbollah, the American proposal requires serious and prolonged discussions and could be a basis for an agreement,' sources told Al Hadath. According to the outline agreed by Israel and the U.S. the main terms of the emerging arrangement include Hezbollah's withdrawal north of the Litani River, deployment of the Lebanese army in the country's south and prevention of weapons smuggling and deliveries from Syria. Israel also insisted on assurances in a side document to be attached to the deal, that would ensure the IDF would be able to operate inside Lebanon if the terms of the agreement are violated by Hezbollah and the Lebanese army or the international peace keepers do not take measures to strop them. Lebanon has said they would not agree to any Israeli military action in its territory and insisted that there would be no additions to the 2006 UN resolution 1701 which Hezbollah ignored.

Pope suggests probe into Gaza war and claims of 'genocide'	In a bold move, Pope Francis urges the international community to scrutinize Israel's actions in Gaza, suggesting they may align with 'genocide' criteria, marking his most pointed critique yet of Israel's prolonged military campaign against Hamas Pope Francis has suggested the global community should study whether Israel's military campaign in Gaza constitutes a genocide of the Palestinian people, in some of his most explicit criticism yet of Israel's conduct in its year-long war. In excerpts published on Sunday from a new forthcoming book, the pontiff said some international experts say 'what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide'. 'We should investigate carefully to assess whether this fits into the technical definition (of genocide) formulated by international jurists and organizations,' the pope said in the excerpts, published by Italian daily La Stampa. Israel has denied all accusations of genocide. The Israeli foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the pope's remarks. Last December South Africa filed a case against Israel at the International Court of Justice for allegedly violating the Genocide Convention. In January the judges at the court ordered Israel to ensure its troops commit no genocidal acts. The court has not yet ruled on the core of the case - whether genocide has occurred in Gaza. Francis, leader of the 1.4-billion-member Catholic Church, is usually careful not to take sides in international conflicts, and to stress de-escalation. But he has stepped up his criticism of Israel's conduct in its war against Hamas recently. In September, he decried the deaths of Palestinian children in Israeli strikes in Gaza. He also sharply criticized Israel's airstrikes in Lebanon as going 'beyond morality'. Francis has not previously described the situation in Gaza as a genocide in public. But last year he was at the center of a messy dispute after a meeting with a group of Palestinians at the Vatican, who insisted he had used the word with them in private, while the Vatican said he had not. The Vatican did not offer comment about Francis' most recent remarks, but its news website reported on Sunday about the book excerpts, including the genocide comment. Last week Francis met at the Vatican with a delegation of former hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, who are advocating for the release of family members and others still being held.

Netanyahu, Mossad chief to meeting about 101 remaining hostages	Amid Mossad Chief David Barnea’s efforts to spearhead Israeli initiatives to reignite negotiations for a deal with Hamas, a critical discussion will be held on the fate of the 101 hostages who have been in Hamas captivity for 408 days Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Mossad Chief David Barnea will meet on Sunday for consultations on the 101 hostages held by Hamas for 408 days. Barnea will lead the meeting against the backdrop of his efforts to jumpstart negotiations, bypassing intermediary states. So far, Hamas has rejected all proposals for a hostage deal and remains adamant about its demands for a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a total cease-fire. Ahead of International Children's Day this week, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum dedicated a rally held Saturday in Tel Aviv to the children affected by the ongoing crisis. The event honored those who have returned from captivity, those still awaiting the return of their parents, and especially the two young Bibas siblings, Ariel and Kfir, who remain in Hamas captivity. Ofri Bibas Levy, the aunt of Ariel and Kfir, spoke at the rally: 'I want to cry on your behalf the way children shout, 'It’s not fair.' It’s not fair that all the other children have returned, but you are still there. It’s not fair that you 'celebrated' holidays and birthdays in captivity. It’s not fair that you haven’t jumped in puddles, gone to the pool, or played at the beach. It’s not fair that you didn’t start preschool. 'It’s not fair that you haven’t hugged your father, Yarden, for 407 days. It’s not fair that you’ve had to be strong for your mom, Shiri. It’s not fair that you lost your grandparents, Yossi and Margit. It’s not fair that you said goodbye to your dad in a shelter, witnessing and enduring things no child in the world should ever experience.' Avital Dekel Chen, the wife of hostage Sagui Dekel Chen, also shared her emotional story: 'Last week, I took my daughters on a three-day vacation. Amid all this pain, I must create moments of joy for them. In one store, my 7-year-old daughter, Bar, came to me and said, 'Mom, look, I found a little chair. Maybe you can buy it for me so I’ll have something to sit on at the rallies?’ 'A 7-year-old who wants a chair for rallies calling for her father’s release, as he waits in Hamas tunnels. And if that’s not heartbreaking enough, my 3-year-old daughter, Gali, hums every day with a half-smile, 'Everyone, now.' A 3-year-old singing about redeeming hostages for her father. 'So, for anyone who still doesn’t understand my reality: I am at war. One war is for the return of Sagiv, the love of my life since I was 14 and the father of my children. The second war is for the souls of my daughters.'

It's euphoric': We took part in a cacao ceremony	Ynet reporter joins group taking part in ancient tradition connecting body and mind via the making and drinking of hot cocoa alongside mediation, dance and music The participants, most in their twenties, sit on comfortable cushions around the host. Atop a local stand, intriguing ethnic musical instruments are displayed and after one final stir of the dark liquid in the pot, the cacao ceremony finally begins. After a long, difficult, and sorrowful year, I came to experience a cacao ceremony on a friend’s recommendation at the Guna House, 'a home for spirituality, mind-body connection and consciousness development' in Herzliya. 'The cacao ceremony is a very ancient ritual that dates back thousands of years to regions in Central and South America. For millennia, it’s been used in two main ways: in ceremonies connecting to the heart and in deep meditation practices,' explains Daniel Taler, instructor for growth and healing processes and the person leading my first cacao ceremony, while stirring the brewing cacao, as the intoxicating aroma of chocolate cake fills the air. 'Cacao is gentle and not as aggressive as other psychedelic plants. Its chemical components help release serotonin and endorphins, making us feel much better. It also affects heart function and blood flow, inducing a euphoric sensation,' he added. Taler has been studying traditional South American cultures for years. 'I spent two summers with the Kogi, an indigenous tribe in northern Colombia. I’m writing about their perceptions of health and illness and their traditional medicine.' The workshop encompasses the entire ceremonial process, from preparing the cacao to guided drinking. 'We start with physical and mental preparation, as participants are asked to focus and set their personal intentions.' 'During the workshop, I guide participants through breathing exercises, meditation and dance, allowing them to connect with themselves more deeply. The cacao serves as a catalyst for this process, fostering an experience of inner connection and release,' Taler adds. 'It’s best to come with an open mind and a willingness to find a new experience. It’s also recommended to arrive on an empty stomach so the cacao can truly take effect. The impact won’t be felt on a full stomach,' he explained before the ceremony began. 'During the workshop, we drink the cacao in silence, smell it, taste it and engage all our senses. The cacao is intentionally unsweetened and sugar-free — pure and organic,' Taler says. 'I want everyone holding the cup to cradle it with both hands, close to their chest, near their heart and not drink immediately. Feel the warmth of the cup, start smelling it and breathe into the experience.' I had planned to down half the pot right away and immediately enjoy all the mood-enhancing, energy-boosting and passion-stimulating properties, but back in reality — the workshop's atmosphere is tranquil, the cacao drink carries a comforting aroma of distant childhood memories and the taste is bitter and intense. 'When drinking cacao, it often feels a bit bitter, a bit thick and more challenging to swallow. It's not like chocolate or a sweet cocoa drink. The act of smelling it and the difficulty in swallowing forces me to be fully present as I bring it into my body. 'This presence allows me to truly feel the sensations it creates, making it much easier to turn inward. The sensation is one of focus and softness, combined with insights and a connection to the body,' Taler explains. 'The effect of cacao varies significantly from person to person when it comes to sensations. The cacao experience alone isn't enough; it's paired with guidance, movement, meditation or sounds.' Slowly, I finish my first cup, surprised at how quickly I can shed my cynicism and really connect to the process. With the second cup — which I couldn't finish — I felt myself entering a very gentle, embracing experience. The lighting is dim and soothing to the eyes. Following the guidance, everyone lies on their backs with closed eyes, letting the cacao do its work. Taler, the guide, moves among the participants, singing an ancient melody in a curious language and skillfully playing traditional Indigenous instruments, including various flutes and a shamanic drum with a single drumstick, producing a mesmerizing sound. I suddenly wake up, feeling my cheeks slightly flushed and needing a split second to remember where I am and who this kind person is, softly singing a quiet melody and fanning me with an Indigenous feather fan gently. The movement and dance phase begins, and we make the most of the precious time gifted by the cacao with precise guidance. Anyone expecting a psychedelic experience would be sorely disappointed — this is a delicate and incredibly pleasant bodily sensation. For a few moments, a fragile feeling of happiness, love and maybe even a hint of optimism washes over me. 'It was amazing. I don’t think it’s something you can really explain in words — you have to experience it,' said Tanya, one of the participants. 'It connects and brings us back to the center of our souls, especially during this tough time we're all going through. The cacao shows us what truly matters in life — love above all.' Another participant shared that she felt the focus Taler described. 'It was as if I had a direct connection to the sensations within me. I felt myself concentrating on the present, unconcerned about what was happening around me. I wasn’t thinking about yesterday or worrying about tomorrow. It was so focused and I’m still under its influence even now. I didn’t expect this; I came with a lot of questions.'

Hezbollah rocket scores direct hit on a a Haifa synagogue, destroying it; Haifa residents expressed shock at the extent of the destruction and at the fact that no one was hurt; 'We had a great miracle. Two hours before that we were still praying here in the synagogue' The residents of Haifa have become accustomed to sirens in recent weeks, following the escalation of missile barrages from Lebanon. On Saturday, Hezbollah fired a barrage into Israel and destroyed a synagogue. Watch the footage of the destruction: The old synagogue had been designated for preservation but was thoroughly destroyed in the strike. A nearby synagogue and a kindergarten also suffered extensive damage. Dozens of surrounding apartments were damaged by shrapnel, and many cars were also destroyed. While waiting for Hezbollah's response to the U.S. cease-fire proposal, the IDF continued to attack in Beirut's Dahieh district on Sunday and announced at noon that it had completed another wave of attacks. Arab media released the footage of the IDF attack in Beirut. Last week, the Israeli Air Force increased the scope and intensity of its attacks in Dahieh. On Saturday the IDF reported it completed a fourth wave of attacks there in one day. The Air Force attacked 50 Hezbollah terrorist targets in one week. On Sunday, another wave of attacks was completed, and the IDF spokesperson said that 'all of the military targets that were attacked were deliberately placed by Hezbollah in the heart of the civilian population. This is another example of the terrorist organization Hezbollah's cynical use of Lebanese citizens as human shields.' As in the previous attacks, this time too there were warnings in advance to the Lebanese population, and no deaths were reported in the attacks. 'Before the attack, many steps were taken to reduce the chance of harming civilians, which include gathering preliminary intelligence, accurate observations, and warnings for the evacuation of the population in the area,' the IDF spokesperson noted. At the scene of the destruction in Haifa, residents expressed shock at the extent of the destruction and at the fact that no one was hurt. 'We had a great miracle. Two hours before that we were still praying here in the synagogue. Look what happened to us here,' says Gershon Zaft, one of the oldest worshipers at the 'Avot ve Banim' synagogue that was hit in Haifa. 'It's a great miracle that there are no casualties.' He noted that the synagogue was completely destroyed. 'The missile hit exactly where we pray. It will take a long time to rebuild our synagogue.' The person in charge of the synagogue, Gideon Goldenbar, also said that the restoration would take a long time. 'Part of the missile hit the synagogue directly, the destruction is extensive. We hope that we will be able to get some Torah scrolls out.' Haifa town representatives arrived at the scene on Sunday and began collecting evidence, along with property tax representatives who go through the many apartments and help residents whose property has been damaged to fill out the necessary forms to receive compensation.

Where did Dana go? Three days in Mexico turns into 17-year-old ni...	Israeli Dana Rishpy's family says she arrived for a short trip to Mexico from the United States in 2007, three days before she disappeared without a trace On the night of March 30, 2007, 25-year-old Dana Rishpy disappeared during a short trip to Mexico. What was meant to be a 10-day vacation turned into one of the most troubling mysteries involving missing Israelis abroad. Seventeen years later, her family is still searching for answers. 'Dana was strong-willed from a young age, with a unique personality,' says her sister, Dalit Rishpy-Tor, 57. 'She was a beautiful woman who starred in ads, but beyond her exterior beauty, she had a special soul. Talented in animation and voiceover, she loved music and knew countless bands and musicians.' 'She chose to become a vegetarian from a young age, was sensitive to animal rights and picked up running in a sports team. She released a song, directed a music video and was filled with passion for creativity,' she added. A spontaneous decision that changed everything Dana hadn’t originally planned to visit Mexico. 'Dana traveled to the United States for a month to explore animation studies,' Dalit recalls. 'In Los Angeles, while staying with relatives, she saw an ad in a newspaper for a deal to Cancun and Mayan sites. She had a return ticket to New York a week after she disappeared.' Rishpy, who held both Israeli and German citizenship, arrived in Cancun on March 26. On March 28, she sent her family what would be her last email: 'I landed in Cancun and arrived at a really nice hostel,' she wrote. 'I’ve met some very nice people – two French guys and a German. I went out with the German one to explore Cancun’s stunning beaches.' She attached several photos and showed no signs of distress in her writing. Two days later, on March 30, Rishpy boarded a bus to the town of Tulum. At the Playa del Carmen station, three men joined her and began talking to her. Upon arriving in Tulum, one of them, an American named Matthew Walshio, invited her to leave her belongings in a room he had rented at the Caribbean Sea hotel. The three men suggested she join them at the Mezzanine club, where a performance was scheduled for that evening. About two weeks after Dana’s disappearance, her parents – who were traveling through national parks in Argentina at the time – received a mysterious email from Walshio. 'He wrote that Dana’s bags were with him in a hut on the beach, that she had woken up in the morning, said she was going to see the Mayan ruins and never returned,' Dalit recalls. She received the news in the middle of her 40th birthday celebration. Three suspects, no answers A detailed journal documented her life and final days in the bag Dana left behind. Through its pages, vital details about the men she encountered came to light. Among them, Matthew Walshio’s profile emerged as particularly troubling. The investigation revealed his criminal past, which included drug trafficking and rape accusations. Days after Dana’s disappearance, realizing he was being looked for, Walshio hurriedly flew back to the U.S. The second suspect, Oscar Granelli, a Norwegian citizen, was seen on club security cameras sitting with Dana during the performance. According to testimony from an Israeli tourist present, Granelli was seen leaving the party with Dana at 1:30 a.m., with his arm around her shoulder, saying, 'Come on, baby.' Granelli, believed to be the last person to see Dana, now also lives in the U.S. Meanwhile, their friend, Gary Almedal, stayed in Mexico and settled in Tulum. Determined not to give up, Dana’s family hired private investigators who managed to locate photos from the party and focused suspicion on the three men. However, the gathered evidence – photos from the event and testimonies from Israeli witnesses – were never pursued by the local police, who dismissed the findings, claiming they were obtained privately. The FBI’s involvement was limited to a brief conversation with Walshio, who chose to remain silent. The Norwegians were never questioned due to a bureaucratic error after they were identified as Swiss in Dana’s journal. The family used every possible avenue – working with the Foreign Ministry, military attachés, insurance teams and law enforcement. They appealed directly to the then-foreign minister, involved Interpol and immediately provided DNA samples. Searches were conducted with the help of police dogs, flyers were distributed and billboards were put up. They reached out to the governor of Mexico, the president, Jewish communities, Israeli companies and businesspeople. Yet, nothing yielded results. In September 2013, six years after Dana’s disappearance, the family thought there might be a glimmer of hope. The Israeli consul and a Defense Ministry attaché met with the head of the Mexican federal police’s missing persons unit, Salomon Baltazar. 'Police in Mexico aren’t really a proper police force,' Dalit says. 'Thousands of people disappear there every day and they couldn’t understand why we were making such a fuss. Each time a body was discovered in the area, the pain resurfaced. 'Some people said they’d seen or heard something, but there was never anything concrete. What’s more, Dana was there for such a short time before disappearing that not many people had the chance to meet her. A year later, a terrible storm hit the area and everything was affected. It’s a place where you could make an entire country disappear.' The family left behind 'My sister and I asked for Dana for my 15th birthday,' Dalit recounts. 'Because of our age gap, I treated her as a mother would.' This special connection carried on, and in 2008, a year after Dana’s disappearance, both Dalit and her sister gave birth to their third child. 'We experienced crises as a family because everyone reacts differently,' she adds. 'I answered emails, gave interviews to the media and approached every important person I could. My sister is more introverted and my brother lives in Spain. My parents, their suffering is indescribable. They have four children and suddenly one of them is gone.' Seventeen years later, the pain and hope remain intertwined. 'If there’s ‘closure,’ you know it was just ‘bad luck,’' Dalit says. 'But without closure, you see someone who reminds you of her and think, ‘Wow,’ or you dream about her or hear about people who returned home after years.' The void is particularly intense on certain dates, such as the day of Dana’s disappearance, or her birthday at the end of May. 'We think about how old she would be now, what she could’ve achieved. When her friends get married or have children, when the kids mention her and ask about her. The loss is in how we carry on while she’s not here.' The latest trigger was on October 7. 'The uncertainty hostages’ families are experiencing is maddening and I’m doing everything I can to support them,' Dalit says. 'Not knowing what happened to their child, their sibling, or loved ones is a nightmare for them.' Never giving up hope Dana’s absence is deeply felt and doesn’t fade, even after 17 years. 'There’s no way she disappeared willingly,' Dalit declares. 'She loved life, she loved her parents dearly, lived with them and didn’t want to leave. She adored her nieces and nephews. She had plans to study. She only wanted to take a short trip.' 'There’s always hope, even after all these years and that’s why I’m speaking out,' Dalit says. 'Maybe tomorrow someone will see this article and remember spotting a confused girl in Mexico who didn’t know who she was.' She pauses, and adds, 'I’m not naïve or imagining things, but there’s still this hope that one day a miracle will happen and she’ll show up. She could’ve had a brilliant future – professionally, personally, and as a mother and aunt. She had her whole life ahead of her.' 'She encountered the wrong people in the wrong place and was too innocent to see the danger,' Dalit says. 'There were times I imagined, even dreamed, that she returned and I hugged her. Unlike other families who experienced crises, there was no crisis here — she was just stepping into life, into independence, with the whole world ahead of her. She only had to choose.'

The real reason Herzog isn't going to the climate conference: Tur...	President's office said in official statement that trip to COP29 was canceled for 'security reasons,' but host Azerbaijan says the real reason is that Turkey refused to allow the Wing of Zion place to pass through its airspace A news website from Azerbaijan that is considered the mouthpiece of the government claims that the real reason President Isaac Herzog canceled his visit to the climate conference in Baku is Turkey's refusal to allow Herzog's plane to fly in its airspace on the way to the meeting. Azeri officials confirmed the veracity of the local media report to Ynet. Herzog was supposed to arrive in Baku on Tuesday for a visit of only a few hours, and Ynet learned that the flight to Azerbaijan was planned to be made on the country's official Wing of Zion plane. On Saturday night, the president's office announced that 'in light of the situation assessment and for security reasons, the president of the country decided to cancel his trip to the climate conference in Azerbaijan.' Israeli officials stated that it was due to security alerts. The Azeris did not like the way Israel framed the decision, and a senior official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan told the Caliber News website that the reason for Herzog's cancellation was not at all related to security, but to the ban imposed by Turkey on allowing the plane carrying Herzog to use its airspace. 'Unfortunately, intensive negotiations through diplomatic channels that lasted for several days did not yield results. Azerbaijan provides has created appropriate conditions for the participation of all parties in the climate conference, but the situation surrounding the Israeli president's visit arose for reasons beyond our country's control,' the source added. According to him, in Azerbaijan - which has repeatedly hosted major regional and global events such as the Eurovision song contest - a high level of security is guaranteed. 'It is not an exaggeration to say that Baku is one of the safest cities in the world,' the source claimed. 'This is confirmed by the fact that a large number of Israeli officials have come to Azerbaijan, including President Herzog himself, who visited Baku on May 30 of this year. Prime Minister Netanyahu also came to Azerbaijan for a one-day visit in 2016.' He noted that 'unprecedented security measures are also being taken in preparation for the conference in connection with the arrival of tens of thousands of guests and about 100 world leaders and heads of high-ranking delegations to the country.' The Azeris were apparently offended by the Israeli report on the reason for the cancellation, and tried through diplomatic contacts to change its framing. Israeli ministers who arrived in Baku did so on commercial flights through Georgia. It is not clear why Herzog did not choose a similar route, but decided to fly on the Wing of Zion.

The police and the Shin Bet announced earlier that three suspects were arrested for involvement in the attack, and they were transferred for investigation by the Shin Bet and the Israel Police's Lahav 433 unit. The attack took place on Saturday night around 7:30 p.m., while Netanyahu and his family were not at home.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rypi00gpz1e	2024-11-16T22:21:20-08:00	
3 arrested for firing flares at Netanyahu's home	Suspects transferred to joint investigation by the Shim Bet and Israel Police for firing at least two flares at prime minister's Caesarea home, which landed on the property; The prime minister and members of his family were not home at the time Three suspects have been arrested in connection with firing two flares at the Caesarea home of Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday night, the Israel Police and Shin Bet announced Sunday morning. The three suspects were transferred to a joint investigation by the Shin Bet and Lahav Unit 433 of the Israel Police, which said in a statement that 'more details will be provided later, depending on the progress of the investigation' On Saturday night, police officers carried out searches in Caesarea , after the flares were fired around 7:30 p.m., allegedly from the direction of the sea. The prime minister and his family members were not home at the time of the incident. 'It was just like on a soccer field, orange smoke that landed in the yard of the Netanyahu family. The family members were not here, but it was definitely something we did not expect to see, certainly not after the drone shot from Lebanon that hit the front of the house. It's stressful,' a neighbor said. Another nearby Netanyahu neighbor said that 'the prime minister and his family members were not at home at the time of the incident. 'Long before the drone struck the house, they stopped coming here, but this is still a worrying escalation. It's scary, and I hope they capture the culprits who fired the flares.' Last month, a drone launched from Lebanon struck the Netanyahus' home, breaking a window. The incident took place precisely after this week the group Moked Caesarea, which led the demonstrations in front of the Prime Minister's private home for five years, announced the end of the demonstrations there and the transfer of the protest to Jerusalem. The decision was made, according to the group, because 'the time has come to step up,' after they demonstrated in front of the house in Caesarea three times a week - protests that were often accompanied by arguments and even confrontations with the police, which led to arrests and severe violence. The incident was condemned from all sides in the political system, and President Isaac Herzog said afterwards that he had spoken with the head of the Shin Bet. He called the incident 'a highly dangerous event, which I strongly condemn. I have just spoken with the Shin Bet chief and emphasized the urgent need to investigate and address those responsible as quickly as possible.' Herzog stressed that this represents 'a dangerous escalation and noted that the investigation is being carried out with the utmost seriousness. We must not let these flames escalate. I continue to warn against the rise of violence among the public — this is a matter of our very survival.' In a post on X, Israel’s new Defense Minister Israel Katz said that the incident has crossed all the 'red lines.' 'It is not possible for the Prime Minister of Israel, who is threatened by Iran and its proxies who are trying to assassinate him, to be subject to the same threats from home,' Katz said in the X post. In his response to the case, Justice Minister Yariv Levin called for renewed promotion of the judicial overhaul. 'The time has come for full backing to be given to the restoration of the justice system and the law enforcement systems,' said Levin, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister. 'There was no need for flares to be fired at the Prime Minister's house, to understand the seriousness of the rampant violence and the refusal on the part of those who are trying to dismantle the country from within.'

Special weekend for wounded IDF soldiers: 'Inspiring conversation...	From Thursday to Saturday night, wounded soldiers and their families enjoyed a series of unique encounters, including with Paralympic champion Asaf Yasur; Yair, a paratrooper who was critically wounded, expressed his gratitude to the donors Last weekend, 140 wounded IDF soldiers and their families were hosted at a hotel in Jerusalem. From Thursday through Saturday night, they participated in lectures, group activities, a festive Shabbat reception and more. The weekend began with an uplifting and optimistic talk by Asaf Yasur, a world champion in taekwondo and gold medalist at the Paris Paralympic Games. When Asaf was 13 years old, he was electrocuted and lost both of his arms. Despite this tragedy, he resolved to live his life with a passion for success. From the moment he discovered taekwondo, he realized that nothing would hold him back. Another highlight of the weekend was Yair Lipschitz, a deputy company commander in the Paratroopers's 101st Battalion, who serves in the IDF as a career officer and was severely wounded in Gaza. Yair was evacuated in critical condition, placed in a medically induced coma and remained on life support for some time. He shared that only two weeks ago, he underwent another surgery, which he hopes will be the last. Four months ago, Yair became the proud father of a baby girl, Hallel. 'I met others who were wounded like me, and the conversations were truly inspiring,' Yair said. 'The meetings with fellow wounded soldiers who have been on a similar journey, as well as with soldiers from the Netzach Yehuda Battalion, who also spent Shabbat at the hotel, were remarkable. I’m left speechless—kudos to everyone involved in organizing this event.' The weekend was generously funded by David Hager, a Haredi businessman from Los Angeles, in partnership with the Netzach Yehuda organization. The event took place at the Leonardo Plaza Hotel in Jerusalem, part of the Fattal hotel chain. Hager explained that from the beginning of the war he has hosted hundreds of reservist families at various hotels to give them relief from the everyday pressures. 'When I visited soldiers and asked how I could help, almost all of them said they were fine but would love for their families back home to be pampered,' Hager shared. 'As the fighting dragged on and during my visits with wounded soldiers, I realized how important it is for families to help their injured loved ones break away from the routine of rehabilitation.' He also praised the management of the Leonardo Plaza Hotel, particularly the hotel’s director, Ortal.

United Torah Judaism and Likud officials who were involved in Katz's announcement claimed that the minister intended to reduce the number of orders, and when he realized that he had no ability to do, he published that 7,000 orders would be issued. Some 1,000 of the orders were issued Sunday.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rja3tzpgkg	2024-11-16T21:17:08-08:00

Blasts shook Ukraine's capital Kyiv and other cities while neighboring Poland scrambled its air force early on Sunday after the two countries said a Russian missile attack was under way. 'Due to the massive attack by the Russian Federation using cruise missiles, ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles on objects located, among others, in western Ukraine, Polish and allied aircraft have started operating in our airspace,' the operational command of NATO member Poland's armed forces posted on X. Blasts were heard in Ukraine's southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia and the Black Sea port of Odesa, Reuters witnesses said, and Ukraine's air force issued air raid alerts for all of the country., although the scale of the attack was unclear. The air force urged residents to take cover and said a number of missiles, including different types of cruise missile, were flying through Ukrainian air space. Ukrainian officials said they had cut power to a number of regions, including Kyiv, as a preventative step.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjcap11wfye	2024-11-16T21:07:10-08:00	
Reservist Idan Kenan, 21, killed by sniper on outskirts of Jabali...	On October 7 of last year, Kenan posted on social media in a message to residents of the south: 'No one here sleeps until you feel safe. I promise you'; To his grandmother he wrote: 'I know what the risks are and accept it. If the Father in Heaven decided that someone should die for our country that is the greatest honor'; Since the beginning of the war, 796 soldiers have fallen Sergeant First Class Idan Kenan, 21, from Ramat Gan, a soldier in the 90th Battalion, Kfir Brigade, was killed by a Hamas sniper on the outskirts of Jabaliya, near Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip, the IDF spokesman announced on Sunday morning. Since the beginning of the war, 796 soldiers have been killed. Adi Kenan, Idan's mother, announced her son's death in a post on Facebook. 'It is with great sadness that I have to announce the murder of my son, Major General Idan Kenan, by a lowly terrorist in the north of the Gaza Strip. The Lord will avenge his blood.' Linoy, Idan's sister, added that he 'died a hero,' and said: 'I will never forget you, I love you so much and I will miss you so much all my life. May your soul be bound in the bond of eternal life. I can't believe you left me like that and went to the next world my beloved brother, it's just not right that you did it. Hero brother, the kindest boy in the world, how did they take you from me like this? I will never be able to overcome a loss like yours. You are my whole world. Watch over us from above my tzaddik, how much God loves you that he let you go on Shabbat, our own black Sabbath. You will remain etched in the hearts of all of us.' Just a few months ago, Kenan wrote to his grandmother: 'Grandma, I don't know if you heard, but there was an attack in our area, one person was killed and my friends were shot, but thank God they are fine and I am fine. Tomorrow will be the funeral, but the boy's parents don't know yet, so not a word to anyone! Just know that everything is fine. Unfortunately, I didn't get to know him. He was killed for our country and we all understand this, and are happy to be there instead of the citizens and the country we love so much.' 'I want to let you know that, no matter what happens, I always love you the most in the world and know exactly what I'm doing and where I am. I know the risks and what can happen and I'm at peace with that - and even more. This is the path I chose and it's the path I believe every man in our country should choose. There is and will be no one to protect us if not us. We are the people of eternity and unfortunately this eternity will always come with hatred and blood, and if the Father in heaven decided that someone should die for our people - this is the greatest honor in the world. Everyone here protects themselves with 10 eyes and prays for the ascension of his soul, although I'm sure he will go to heaven. I'll probably be there at night until the funeral because I have to help prepare everything. Know that I love you and that we will never be separated,' he concluded. On October 7 last year, Kenan posted on Instagram: 'No one here sleeps until you feel safe. I promise you. Residents of the center and the south, take care of yourselves. We don't have another country.' On Saturday night, the IDF spokesman announced Sergeant Ori Nisanovich, 21, from Jerusalem, a soldier in the Golani Brigade's 13th Battalion fell on Friday during combat in southern Lebanon. Nisanovich was a student at the Avinoam Hesder yeshiva in Evyatar. At his son's funeral Saturday night in the Har Herzl cemetery, Roni, Ori's father, said that 'Ori spoke about the honor of protecting the people of Israel from our enemies, he was not interested in anything except the importance of what he was doing in the IDF. Before entering Lebanon, he called me and I brought up the topic of what could happen; then Ori stopped me and said 'Dad, listen, I'm happy with what I've chosen and I'm not sorry for what could happen'. He called my wife and his sister, and had a similar conversation with them. The second time he entered Lebanon, he also told me, 'If I have to sacrifice myself, that's fine.''

Hitler's book in the living room: IDF commandos operating in Leba...	Ynet reporter joins elite Duvdevan soldiers spearheading the fight against Hezbollah after serving in the West Bank and Gaza; 'We can’t underestimate this enemy' 'The darkness is our ally,' says Lt. Col. A., commander of the IDF Commando Brigade’s Duvdevan unit. He sits on a couch in the middle of a children’s room inside a luxurious Lebanese estate in a village overlooking Israel's northern communities. Around him, his soldiers are fully equipped, carrying ammunition, weapons and specialized gear. The windows are covered and a thick fabric carpet blocks any light entering the room. 'Even the smallest flicker is an immediate threat of anti-tank fire into the compound,' explains one of the soldiers. On the table in the center of the room stands a small projector displaying maps and operational plans on the wall. Conversations are held in hushed tones and the cold is barely noticeable due to the crowded space. The tension and alertness are palpable among the soldiers, who clearly understand where they are. Lt. Col. A. tells me, 'These are Duvdevan soldiers. You're at the deepest point the IDF has set foot in Lebanon. We'll launch the attack from here.' 'I'm living a double life' An hour earlier, we were still at the assembly point, which military censorship restrictions prevent me from specifying. In the convoy of Hummers, we used to enter, we met reservists, some of whom have been serving for over 250 days. They’ve fought in all of the IDF’s active fronts. 'I was in Gaza, fought with the unit in the West Bank and now we've come here,' says a 40-year-old soldier, a married father of two young children who lives in Jaffa and works as an investment manager. 'My wife’s trying to keep the business afloat. It’s tough, but there’s no choice,' he says. When I asked how he copes with so many reserve days in a year, he answered, 'It’s not simple. I’m basically living a double life. These hands hold a weapon one moment, shaking as they fire in all directions and the next moment, they’re bathing my baby in the tub. It’s really hard to explain.' We boarded the Hummers and began our advance. But before that, let’s delve into Duvdevan’s role in the war. Considered one of the IDF's elite units, Duvdevan is part of the Commando Brigade and specializes in counterterrorism, operating in urban and densely populated areas using undercover tactics. For years, the unit has proven itself critical, primarily operating in the West Bank. The soldiers carry out special missions, mastering unique techniques such as rapid movement between tightly packed buildings and operations under high-pressure conditions. On October 7, 2023, the unit operated in the kibbutzim of Kfar Aza and Be'eri before spreading out to other communities on the Gaza border, where they engaged in battles against dozens of terrorists and rescued numerous residents from their homes. The unit then resumed intense operations in their familiar territory — the West Bank. Alongside soldiers from Reserve Unit 6217, they conducted dozens of targeted missions, including eliminating terrorists face-to-face, uncovering and destroying bomb-making factories and an operational command center in the Jordan Valley and cornering terrorists holed up in buildings. The unit eliminated the terror military leader of the village of Tubas and his predecessor in the months prior. They also thwarted numerous attacks including intercepting suspects en route to central Israel. They were responsible for neutralizing a terrorist carrying explosives and weapons as he moved from Jenin set to kill Israelis. After their operations in the West Bank, the unit moved to Gaza, where they conducted missions at AL-Shifa and Nasser hospitals, carried out strikes in Khan Younis and Al-Shati camps, and arrived here a few days ago. 'We found a copy of Mein Kampf' Duvdevan soldiers are now working to clear the area. They operate under the Commando Brigade, deployed across the region and functioning under the 91st Division, commanded by Brig. Gen. Shai Kalper. The late-night drive into the area is conducted without lights. The unit's highly skilled drivers drive at high speeds in close convoy formation to minimize exposure to gunfire. Despite the fog and challenging terrain, they maintain minimal spacing — a true art. We arrived at the house where the unit commander was based. Here, the houses are mansions — multi-story buildings used by Hezbollah terrorists for planting explosives, hiding rockets and storing equipment, all ready for combat. Some locations also include underground infrastructure. As we left the house, we met two soldiers from Jerusalem, who wanted to share what they’d found in some of the buildings. 'At first, we found only pictures of [Hassan] Nasrallah, which is expected. But later, we also found photos of [Ali] Khamenei and other Iranian officers.' 'It’s clear evidence of the connection,' they said. 'In one of the living rooms, we even found a copy of Mein Kampf, Hitler’s book. Parts were underlined and highlighted inside as if someone had studied it line by line. This is Nazism in its rawest and most blatant form,' they added. On the way to the second target, we spoke with H., the unit's deputy commander, who explained the unique challenges the soldiers face. 'There’s no doubt the terrain and type of operations are different from what we’re used to in the West Bank,' he said. 'In the West Bank, the buildings are densely packed and you move through alleys and fight accordingly. Most of the area is flat. The terrain in Gaza is similar. But here in Lebanon, it’s very mountainous and the distance between houses is greater,' he explained. 'We can’t underestimate this enemy' 'You need to move during the day and night while utilizing different methods from those we’re accustomed to. But the unit's soldiers are adept at this. At the end of the day, a soldier is a soldier.' He added, 'We can’t underestimate this enemy called Hezbollah. They adapt to us in real-time. They don’t attack immediately upon encountering us. They observe, gather fragments of information and then launch their assault. This happens during combat, but we adapt as well — and faster.' We reached the second building in the middle of the night. While I can’t detail the unit's special camouflage capabilities, it’s evident how difficult it is to determine if soldiers are inside. 'This is part of our skillset — to integrate ourselves seamlessly into the surroundings,' the unit commander explained at the building’s entrance. 'I also work with tanks here, which isn’t something I have in the West Bank, but you adjust to it quickly. Ultimately, our mission is to clear the village and the extensive firepower capabilities I have here help me achieve that,' he added. Now, we’re boarding the Hummers for the journey back to Israel. The soldiers staying behind will continue their mission of clearing the area. Everyone speaks in terms of existential warfare and history, understanding they’re part of a significant moment for the country. Yet, they have one simple request: 'Let us do our job so the residents of the north can return to their homes as safely as possible.'

Hezbollah-Israel conflict disrupts Syria’s lucrative Captagon tra...	Syria's reliance on Captagon smuggling faces new challenges as the ongoing conflict with Hezbollah threatens to undermine critical revenues for the Assad regime Syria’s illegal drug trade, a critical economic pillar for President Bashar Assad’s regime, is under threat as the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah disrupts the production and smuggling of Captagon, an illicit stimulant wildly popular across the Middle East. The weakening of Hezbollah, a key ally and facilitator in the drug industry, could lead to significant economic repercussions for the Syrian government. The role of Captagon in Syria’s economy Captagon, a brand name for the synthetic stimulant fenethylline, has become a major source of revenue for Syria. The country is currently the world’s largest producer of Captagon, with Syrian drug trafficking reaching nearly three times the value of the combined drug trade of Mexican cartels, according to Syrian economic journalist Samir Tawil. 'The war in Syria has drained many economic resources, leading the regime to seek alternative funding,' Tawil told The Media Line. 'Drugs of all kinds have become the most important economic resource for the Syrian regime and Hezbollah over the past 10 years.' Sanctions and key figures in the drug trade In March of last year, the UK, the US, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals suspected of involvement in the Captagon trade, including two of Assad’s cousins. The Syrian regime, along with Hezbollah—the Lebanese group closely intertwined with the regime—is believed to rely on drug sales to fund military actions. According to the UK, Assad earns around $60 billion annually from drug revenue. During the announcement of its sanctions, the UK asserted that the Syrian regime 'plays a central role in the drug trade, with shipments worth billions of dollars leaving regime-controlled strongholds like the port of Latakia.' The 4th Armored Division and Hezbollah’s involvement The drug trade in Syria is overseen by high-ranking officials and military units, notably the 4th Armored Division led by Maher Assad, the president’s brother, and his deputy Ghassan Bilal. Both have been implicated in facilitating drug production and smuggling. In 2021, during the trial of Hassan Muhammad Daqou, a Syrian-Lebanese drug trafficker known as the 'King of Captagon,' evidence emerged of conversations between Daqou and Bilal discussing smuggling drugs across the Syria-Lebanon border. A source within the 4th Armored Division, speaking on condition of anonymity, revealed that most soldiers are involved in the drug trade. 'The highest authorities provide security cover for those involved, in exchange for absolute loyalty to the Syrian regime,' the source said. Hezbollah’s global drug operations Hezbollah’s involvement in drug trafficking extends beyond the Middle East. In 2002, the arrest of Lebanese citizen Asaad Barakat in Brazil on tax evasion charges unveiled his role in raising funds for Hezbollah through drug trafficking in Latin America. Subsequent arrests included Nemer Zaiter in 2008 for attempting to smuggle cocaine into the US and Hamza Barakat in 2013 for founding a fraud and smuggling network. Dozens more have been arrested on similar charges, highlighting Hezbollah’s global network for funding through illicit means. Iran’s financial support to Hezbollah Hezbollah has long relied on financial and military support from Iran. In the 1980s, Iran provided $100 million annually, increasing to $200 million by 2005 and $300 million from 2006 to 2009. Despite fluctuations due to sanctions and oil prices, recent years have seen Iran’s support stabilize around $700 million annually, especially after sanctions were lifted during the presidencies of Barack Obama and Joe Biden. The Israeli assassination of Syrian businessman Baraa Qatirji on July 15 revealed his involvement in transporting funds from Iran to Hezbollah. Funds were moved by the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) through oil and cash shipments to Syria, sold to a company called 'BS' owned by Qatirji, with proceeds transferred to Hezbollah. Mustafa Al-Naimi, an expert on Iranian affairs, told The Media Line that Hezbollah receives not only financial but also military support from Iran, with members undergoing training in Iran and Syria. He noted that Hezbollah is currently facing significant setbacks due to the loss of fighters in the war with Israel and the disruption of financial routes from Iran via Syria. The Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association Another key financial arm of Hezbollah is the Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association, founded in 1982 with over 30 branches in Lebanon. Operating outside the supervision of Lebanon’s central bank, it is on Israel’s terrorist list, according to The New York Times. Adam Smith, former Senior Advisor to the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), described the association as a 'state within a state' in Lebanon and a primary source of Hezbollah’s funding. The US Treasury imposed sanctions on Al-Qard Al-Hassan in 2007 and expanded them in 2021 to include six employees who funneled over $500 million through Lebanese banks. US Legislative Actions Against the Captagon Trade In December 2022, US President Joe Biden signed the 'Captagon Act,' declaring Syria’s involvement in the drug trade a national security threat. The law targets networks involved in Captagon production and trafficking linked to the Assad regime. Subsequent legislation specifically targeted members of Assad’s family, including Maher Assad and figures from the 4th Armored Division. Impact of the Israel-Hezbollah war on drug trafficking The recent conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has significantly disrupted drug smuggling operations. Jordan and Saudi Arabia have reported a notable decline in drug seizures at their borders over the past month compared to previous years. Political analyst Wael Khalidi noted that drug smuggling is a primary topic in meetings between Jordanian and Syrian officials. 'The last month has seen economic stagnation in the Syrian regime due to the decline in Captagon smuggling, caused by the war between Israel and Hezbollah,' Khalidi told The Media Line. Residents in Damascus have observed a shortage of Captagon supplies, with dealers attributing the disruption to Hezbollah’s involvement in the conflict. Ahmad M., a local resident, said that drug users are having trouble getting their fix due to decreased supply. Calls for international action Khalidi urges stronger international efforts to combat the drug trade originating from Syria. 'Drugs are not difficult to smuggle from Syria to Washington,' he warned. 'The smuggling networks are highly trained and operate in the interests of Hezbollah and Assad.' He emphasizes that leniency shown to Syria, including its reintegration into the Arab League and trade deals under the guise of humanitarian aid, has facilitated the drug trade, especially through the port of Latakia. Entire generations are being lost due to drugs, whether through addiction or trafficking, Khalidi said. The story is written by Rizik Alabi and reprinted with permission from The Media Line.

Police investigate flares fired toward Netnyahu's residence	Security forces search for suspect who fired at least two flares toward prime minister's Caesarea home; Officials condemn incident as 'dangerous' Police officers carried out searches in Caesarea after flares were fired toward Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in the town. The flares are suspected to have been launched from the sea, but the circumstances of the incident are still under investigation, and no suspects have been arrested. According to the Shin Bet and the police, 'Around 7:30 p.m., two flares were identified near the prime minister's home in Caesarea and landed in the yard. Police and Shin Bet forces are on the scene.' 'The prime minister and his family weren’t present at the time of the incident. Israel Security Agency and the Israel Police have launched a joint investigation into the incident. This is a serious event representing a dangerous escalation and the necessary measures will be taken accordingly,' it added. Opposition Leader Yair Lapid said, 'I strongly condemn the firing of flares at the prime minister's home. I expect the police to find those responsible and hold them fully accountable.' President Isaac Herzog called the incident 'a highly dangerous event, which I strongly condemn. I have just spoken with the Shin Bet chief and emphasized the urgent need to investigate and address those responsible as quickly as possible. 'He stressed that this represents a dangerous escalation and noted that the investigation is being carried out with the utmost seriousness. We must not let these flames escalate. I continue to warn against the rise of violence among the public — this is a matter of our very survival.' The police initially reported about a single flare fired, saying that officers already deployed in the area began searches immediately after receiving the report. The officers located 'remains of military equipment consistent with flare use.' A police sapper held an additional examination to rule out any further danger.

They called me a traitor': The Syria-born journalist interviewin...	Hayvi Bouzo, who fled from her home country to the U.S., tells Ynet about her decision to interview Israelis after October 7 and the Arab media's bias against them 'Let’s start from the end,' I say to veteran Kurdish–Syrian journalist, Hayvi Bouzo who, for fear of the authorities, has moved to Washington. Let’s focus on the here and now. For her Yalla website, each week she interviews Israelis – mainly those who lost family members in the October 7 massacre, but there are also other Israelis she feels it’s important to let the Arab world know about. She’s the only Arab journalist who has made this her life’s mission. The numbers show she has somewhere between 750 thousand and one million followers on Yalla. With which Israeli did you instantly find common language, someone who evoked empathy and whom you would like to meet again? Hayvi (in English: Hope) smiles through the screen. 'Lior Raz. Definitely. The hero from Fauda. I interviewed him and enjoyed every minute of it. Let me tell you a secret. I watched all four series of Fauda. I didn’t miss a single episode. It’s a fantastic series. I know they’re working on a fifth series.' 'For me, Lior Raz is the ultimate Israeli,' she says. 'Smart, honest and pleasant, but hard and straight-talking. He also speaks Arabic, earning him extra points as far as I’m concerned. We sat and chatted in Arabic and the conversation flowed. We’re interested in the same things – the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, relations between Israel and the Arab states, and young people in the Arab world. Lior Raz’s episode on Yalla got lots of views in the Arab world.' Which Israeli most touched you? Without hesitating, she answers, 'Yifat Ziller, cousin to Yarden Bibas, held hostage in Gaza. It was so hard. I cried through the whole interview as she talked about Shiri, Yarden and their two wonderful little red-haired children. 'I can’t forget Ariel, who was four when kidnapped, and his brother Kfir who was only nine months old. Before the interview, I looked at some pictures and decided I’d be strong, but my conversation with Yifat broke me. I thought of my own two children, Gino (11) and Talia (8). I told my husband Hans that I couldn’t imagine how I’d keep it together if a disaster as horrific as that ever happened to us.' Bouzo, 41, was born in Damascus into what she describes as an 'unusual' family. 'In our home,' she says 'when Hafez el Assad, Bashar’s father, was in power, and the dictatorship took the liberty of listening in on its citizens, nabbing them off the street, interrogating and torturing them, sometimes to death – my family behaved differently. 'Our home was always open and I always wanted to be a journalist. I’ve been curious about people ever since I can remember, and I fought to break down barriers in the closed environment in which I was raised. At home, I could talk about anything. Outside, I learned to be quiet.' Weren’t you afraid? 'Obviously. We didn’t take to the streets to demonstrate against the government and we didn’t have political conversations with people we didn’t know we could trust. Amongst ourselves, however, and with close friends we talked about everything. 'I was born in Damascus at a time when the state ran its citizens’ lives by brainwashing them, mainly the young people. This means that each and every citizen was destined to be a tool of the regime, and it continues to this day. ' 'People who live in democracies don’t understand the life of a small individual in a dictatorship. I keep thinking about the young people in Syria whose lives are run under enormous fear, and it breaks my heart. 'What would have happened to me if I’d carried on living in Damascus right under the noses of security and intelligence agencies? I’d have either been arrested as I wouldn’t have been able to keep my mouth shut about the regime’s injustices, or I’d have gone underground like lots of my friends did, until they got caught.' What does 'got caught' mean? 'They take you for violent interrogations. The girls, many of whom are virgins, they rape as part of the ’absorption process’ and ruin their lives. And they beat up and torture the men. If they’re lucky, they’ll be released a couple of days later. In other cases, they’ll be transferred to detention and trial, accusing them of God knows what. It’s just terrible.' The Jewish butcher in Damascus Bouzo was raised with stories of her parents’ Jewish neighbors. 'My father would buy the meat from the Jewish butchers in Damascus - because of the meat’s quality, and the shop’s cleanliness,' she recalls. 'They had good very neighborly relations and my mother, who was raised in a Jewish neighborhood of Aleppo, would visit her Jewish neighbors and eat the Jewish food they cooked and took on quite a few of their customs.' 'Everything was very calm and normal and until the Ba’ath party took over, and the Jews in the neighborhood started disappearing. My mother was wandering around in tears knowing she’d never see her Jewish neighbors again. They left everything behind. Very few managed to sell their homes. Some, from what I realized much later, went to the United States, others to the ‘Zionist state’.' Bouzo also moved to the United States with her family, but the family returned to Syria because 'we weren’t afraid.' She started working as a TV presenter for a Syrian state TV channel, relocated to Dubai following a job offer from Orient TV, and returned to Syria to work for El Sham TV, that she describes as 'the first, failed, attempt to set up a private TV channel in Syria. We were forced to closed due to government pressure, because we were disrupting them.' While working at a state radio station in Syria, on one show she mentioned 'totally innocuously, that Jerry Seinfeld’s mother was a Jews born in Aleppo. Out of nowhere, I was flooded with phone calls' she says. 'They shouted ‘Shame on you’ and ‘How can you even think of mentioning the Jewish woman?’. They said horrific things about Israel and cursed me. I explained that I hadn’t meant to bring politics into the show, that I was just stating a fact. It was hinted to me that it was Bashar el Assad’s people who had called to scare me. I was fired from the show two days later. Simply because of Jerry Seinfeld’s mother.' When did you start taking an interest in the Jewish-Arab conflict? 'From a very young age. Around the end of grade school. At our school, they talked about politics a lot, as well as about Jews and the State of Israel.' What does the State of Israel look like from Syria? 'The Syrians look at Israel with an inferiority complex. On official state-run TV channels, there are no representations of Israel apart from it being an enemy country, soldiers, wars, hatred and hostility. There’s no chance of seeing daily life in Israel or of broadcasting a piece by a foreign journalist visiting Israel giving his impression from the street, like you guys do for Syria. 'The regime in Damascus wants Syrians to hate you. And Iran fans the flames. Even coming across the name ‘Israel’ rather than the ‘Zionist entity’ would be a step forward.' And the young people? 'They’re afraid to go out to demonstrate. There’s no ‘fighting spirit’ among the young people in Damascus like there is in Tehran.' I saw pictures of you with Noa Kirel. How was that connection made? I was at a beauty pageant in Eilat along with former Miss Iraq, Sarah Idan, and another journalist from Bahrain and the cameras were constantly on us.' Did it bother you? 'Not at all. I just kept wondering how they’d treat an Israeli woman if she were to show up at an event in Damascus. The discrepancy is enormous. Noa is so sweet and lovely. She knows the work. Although interviewing singers isn’t really my style, I enjoyed it as there’s something very genuine and positive about her. It wasn’t a long conversation, but I was surprised by the thousands of responses after it was broadcast. They wouldn’t admit it, but it looks like they know who Noa Kirel is in the Arab world.' Who was the first Israeli you interviewed? 'It was even before Yalla. While working on Orient, I asked to meet your ambassador, Danny Dannon who responded immediately.' How was the interview with Danny Dannon received in Syria? 'Ah. That I can’t forget. They called me a traitor. I then knew I had no chance of going to Syria anymore as I’d be tried for treason. It didn’t me bother though, as I knew that they watched the interview despite my being a ‘traitor’.' Don’t you feel you’re putting your life in danger? 'If they were to get to me, that wouldn’t be good for me. Let’s just say that I live under the illusion that they don’t know exactly where I live or where my studio is.' Scenes and memories Thomas Hand, father of Emily who was kidnapped to Gaza and returned, was also interviewed by Bouzo. 'It was hard. I wasn’t prepared to deal with the story of the little girl whose mother had died, who was kidnapped, and whose fate was unknown' she says. 'I had to be composed with him during the broadcast. It's not an Israeli audience that identifies with this terrible story. My job is to use the force of the story to convince my audience. They can hit me with thousands of horrific stories on the Palestinian side, but I know that my audience is also shocked by the stories. There are hundreds of TV channels in the Arab world, none of which present the Israeli side. There’s no mention of the hostages or their families.' Her list of Israeli interviewees is long, but 'I deliberately won’t mention their names to an Israeli newspaper, although I do remember every single one' she says. 'They’ve included Jewish mothers and Arab fathers whose children had been kidnapped. Making their voices heard in the Arab world seems like a very important task' What reactions did you get? Bouzo: 'Mainly insults, swearing and cursing. They don’t write me nice things. I understand, but it doesn’t bother me. People in the Arab world haven’t gotten used to looking at Israel objectively. You bring out the fear and very strong emotions, mainly envy.' She says that Michael Levy talked to her about his dream of bringing back his brother Or, father of three-year-old Almog whose mother Einav was murdered and who has been raised by his grandparents for the past year. 'It’s a very good thing that the world is rid of him. I’m sure the people of Lebanon are happy, although they obviously can’t demonstrate their joy over Nasrallah’s assassination.' 'I wake up every morning and think about what I have to do to bring back my brother' he told Bouzo. 'I talk, meet people, tell the kidnapping story to remind people, mainly overseas, that there are hostages and that they have families.' This conversation, too, was met with cursing and reminding her of the Gazans’ situation. Between interviewing hostages’ families, Bouzo also talks to fascinating figures, mainly in the Arab world 'to break down the Israeli wall' she explains. 'I interviewed a young woman who had fled Egypt, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the son of the Shah of Iran, Reza Pahlavi, following his highly publicized visit to Israel. This interview accrued so many views and garnered so much interest that I requested, and was granted, a second interview to talk about Iran today and Pahlavi’s special relationship with Israel.' 'The more I think about it,' says Bouzo, 'if I’d have stayed in Syria, I’d have been dead long ago. The Syrian regime has a lot of beef with me, ever since I wrote on Facebook what the regime was doing in the city of Daraa on the Jordanian border. It was a horrific massacre that started off with arresting children and carried on to chopping off hands and feet during interrogations. They did it in the most brutal manner, along with their partners from Hezbollah in Lebanon.' 'My family and I started getting death threats. My uncle heard from Mukhabarat (Syrian intelligence) people in Damascus that my name appeared on an arrest list and was taken aback as he knew that if I was arrested, my parents and sister weren’t safe either. 'We decided to leave quickly before they caught us. We flew to the UAE, and from there on to the United States. If I’d have missed the flight, I wouldn’t be alive today. After I left, I learned that the Syrian regime had executed journalists like me who had written about the regime’s crimes. I still have nightmares about what could have happened if I would have insisted on staying.' Bouzo visited Israel for the first time in December and says, 'I dream of coming again.' The Arab-Jewish organization, Sharaka brought her to Israel as a special guest and arranged a trip kicking off in Eilat, visiting Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and ending up on the Israeli-Syrian border, and included visiting a border-adjacent Israeli winery. What did you feel when you stood by the border and saw the Lebanese and Syrian sides? 'I cried shamelessly. The Israeli side was in full bloom, flourishing. I looked at the other side and knew nothing there was blossoming or there’s no kind of human thriving. All the houses beyond the border are being used as arsenals and covers for Hezbollah.' A sigh of relief One stop on Bouzo’s journey getting to know Israel, was at the Erez crossing on the Gaza border. 'I talked to Palestinian women at the crossing and asked them what they thought about peace with Israel' she says. 'Without exception, and I spoke to at least ten women at the crossing, they said that very much wanted there to be peace. I believe the initiative has to come from the Israeli side - talking about peace with the Palestinians and taking steps toward peace, because you’re the strong side.' You must be familiar with Netanyahu’s views on peace with the Palestinians 'I observe from the sidelines, and would rather not go into controversial matters in Israel that I don’t know about. I very much respect Netanyahu. He’s a smart and realistic leader. I know that not everyone in Israel likes him, but I stand by what I’m saying: Netanyahu is very suitable for Israel at this difficult time, and he'll also win the next election, because he’d got it.' Are you in touch with your family in Syria? 'I was last there in 2011, and I dare not go back as I know exactly what awaits me there. For their own safety, I also don’t initiate contact with my family. Every now and then, I get information about them, but I don’t initiate phone calls. 'I feel very sorry for them and for anyone in Syria against their will - and that’s most Syrians. I know I’ll never go back there. I’m married to an American. I have a son and daughter. My life is good and I’m not looking for trouble.' 'As long as Bashar el Assad is in government, under Iran’s thumb, there’s also no chance of changing things in Syria. He’s not a man of peace. He’s a weak leader who the Iranians and Russians are exploiting and doing whatever they want in Syria. That said, there are signs that Assad and the gang around him are totally fed up with the Iranians and are looking for ways of getting them out of influential positions without harming the president’s status.' Bouzo has been following the chain of assassinations in Lebanon with keen interest. That of Nasrallah fascinates her. 'Because of his special persona as a villain serving the Iranian regime through his organization, Hezbollah that lives off exporting drugs,' she explains. 'What can we say about such a ‘freedom fighter’? It’s a very good thing that the world is rid of him. I’m sure the people of Lebanon are happy, although they obviously can’t demonstrate their joy over Nasrallah’s assassination, or those of all the other wicked people.' Bouzo wishes to stress that she doesn’t regard the destruction of Hezbollah’s leadership as 'assassinations'. 'They have so much blood on their hands – the blood of citizens of my homeland in Syria, the blood of Lebanese who tried opposing Hezbollah and the blood of Israelis,' she says. 'I see these operations in Lebanon from the beepers injuring Hezbollah activists, then the walkie-talkies and through to making the Hezbollah leadership disappear, all the way up to Nasrallah – as a just war. I’m willing to say out loud to whoever will listen, that they deserved it, and that Israeli struck them in a very sophisticated way. I’m glad that you’re setting Lebanon ablaze to get rid of Hezbollah.' 'I want to tell you and all your readers in Israel how wonderful it was and how happy it made me to see a sigh of relief across Arabic social media. Countries in the Arab world haven’t yet plucked up the courage - as they’re subjects of dictatorships - but I’m sure we’ll soon here cheers of joys for the fate of Hezbollah leaders. We’ll hear them in Syria, Saudi Arabia and mainly in Lebanon.' 'A new process has started here. Mark my words. A new process that needs to be utilized wisely. You need to think together, at the most senior levels, how to redesign the Middle East. There’s much work to be done, and it won’t be easy, but it needs to be done for the people even for the sake of the wavering regimes, and I’m sure you know which regimes I mean.' Of Yahiya Sinwar’s assassination, she says, 'Assassinating a creature as evil as Sinwar is an important step toward freeing the world of the threat of terrorism. His bloody regime has caused the deaths of so many Israelis, and he’s also killed Palestinians - innocent people. ' His assassination conveys a message to anyone seeking to disseminate terror: The regime in Tehran is shaking in its boots and any terrorist organization is feeling the pressure right now. Sinwar’s assassination is a victory for justice and brings the world one step closer to a safer and freer world.' Is there anything you’d like to tell Israeli readers before wrapping up? 'I’ve started learning Hebrew. It’s really not hard. I already know words beyond ‘shalom’ (hello), ‘todah’ (thank you) and ‘lehitra’ot’ (goodbye). They say the word ‘savlanut’ (patience) is very important for you, but I understand you guys don’t have too much patience.'

Iran denies reports of Musk meeting with officials	Country's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi denies foreign report claiming it was 'fabricated' by US media due to ulterior and unclear motives Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi strongly denied a reported meeting between Tehran's United Nations envoy and U.S. billionaire Elon Musk, state TV reported on Saturday. 'This was a fabricated story by American media, and the motives behind this can also be speculated,' Araqchi said. Tehran's denial of the meeting comes following a New York Times report published on Thursday citing several Iranian officials who said Musk sojourned with Iranian UN ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani in New York on Monday. According to the report, the secret meeting, requested by Musk, lasted over an hour and was described as 'positive' and 'good news.' Musk did not respond to requests for comment from the Times. Trump’s communications director, Steven Cheung, declined to address the meeting, saying, 'We do not comment on reports of private meetings that did or did not occur.' According to the Times, the meeting allowed Iran to engage indirectly with the incoming administration, as Musk is expected to take a role in the Trump administration as co-director of a yet-to-be-estblished government efficiency agency. Iranian officials reportedly suggested Musk seek sanctions exemptions from the U.S. Treasury and explore bringing his businesses to Tehran.

Iran secretly elected its next leader, report says	Sources close to Tehran's regime claim Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei elected his second son for the role and may abdicate even before his death Tehran has secretly chosen Mojtaba Khamenei, the second son of Iran's Supreme leader Ali Khamenei, as the next head of the country, Iran International, a Persian-language international media outlet with ties to Iranian regime opponents reported on Saturday. According to the report, Mojtaba may assume the role even before the death of his 85-year-old father, who is reportedly suffering from a severe illness. The report claimed that 60 members of Iran's Assembly of Experts convened on September 26 in an exceptionally unusual meeting at the elder Khamenei's demand. They were instructed to decide on the succession immediately, without prior notice and under strict confidentiality. Despite initial opposition to both the decision and the process, the assembly ultimately reached a unanimous agreement to designate Mojtaba as the successor following the leader's and his representatives' insistence, which allegedly included direct threats. The assembly resolved to maintain maximum secrecy over the decision due to fears of widespread public protests. Members were warned to keep the meeting confidential, with threats of repercussions for any leaks. Indeed, the meeting's details were kept under wraps for five weeks. Concerns about protests stem from the undemocratic nature of the process, compounded by Khamenei's prior designation of his second son for the role. Over the past two years, Mojtaba has been groomed for leadership, taking on a more active and central role in decision-making related to the Iranian regime. His appointment has thus become a foregone conclusion despite his lack of experience and the absence of any formal positions in the government. Sources familiar with the meeting indicated that Iran's supreme leader might hand over the reins to his second son during his lifetime, taking steps to prepare for a smooth transition. They believe Khamenei hopes to secure Mojtaba's leadership and preempt the anticipated opposition that could arise after his passing.

Rocket hits Haifa synagogue after Hezbollah salvo	IDF says only some of the munitions were intercepted with at least 10 being launched; fall causes damages, injury as a result of running for shelter The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported on Saturday that Hezbollah fired at least 10 rockets toward Haifa with only some of them being intercepted by the Iron Dome. The hit damaged the local 'Avot U'Banim' synagogue in the city According to the Magen David Adom emergency service, one woman was injured while running for shelter before a rocket hit the Merkaz HaCarmel neighborhood in the city, where vehicles were set on fire as a result. Reports suggested another hit was seen in another part of the city, with no reports of injuries or damages. Israel's National Rescue and Fire Authority said a vehicle caught fire in one scene, causing damage to several buildings found nearby. 'At this time, there are no reports of trapped individuals or wounded, but firefighters on the scene alongside medical teams and the Israel Police continue searching in order to rule out victims,' the authority said in a statement. The barrage comes following an intense day of fighting against the Iran-backed terror group, with the IDF bombarding Hezbollah's stronghold in Lebanon's capital in eight strike waves throughout the day. Lebanese reports indicated that Israeli airstrikes have intensified in Dahieh, with multiple hits reported within minutes of each other. Local media has claimed that the scope of the destruction in the southern Beirut suburb is reminiscent of the 2006 Lebanon War.

IDF names fallen soldier killed in Lebanon battles	Sergeant Ori Nisanovich, 21, from Jerusalem, a soldier in the Golani Brigade's 13th Battalion killed in action fighting Hezbollah terrorists The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported on Saturday that Sergeant Ori Nisanovich, 21, from Jerusalem, a soldier in the Golani Brigade's 13th Battalion fell during combat in southern Lebanon. Some 795 soldiers have fallen since the start of the war in Gaza. The IDF has intensified its strikes in Lebanon in recent days. Over the weekend, the Israeli Air Force targeted over 20 sites in Beirut's Dahieh district across eight strike waves. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi addressed the fighting against Hezbollah during a visit to southern Lebanon on Saturday, saying, 'Hezbollah has paid a big price, its chain of command has collapsed, many of its operatives have been killed, and extensive infrastructure dismantled. This organization will continue to fire, and we will continue to fight, to implement plans, to go further, conduct deep strikes, and hit Hezbollah very hard.' Meanwhile, Israel is waiting for Lebanon's response to a draft agreement delivered by the U.S. on Friday. Security officials estimate Hezbollah and the Lebanese government won't agree to give Israel freedom of action in cases of violations, foreseeing several more days of disputes and negotiations before the Lebanese consent. Israel has agreed that the Lebanese army will be equipped by three entities — the U.S., France and the UK— which will also serve as guarantors and participate in the agreement's enforcement. Despite this, skepticism remains in Israel regarding the Lebanese army's ability to act against Hezbollah.

Trump's pro-Israel cabinet picks upset Muslims who voted for him	Muslim leaders protest the president-elect's nominations following his election victory, accusing him of placing Israel above his local voter base U.S. Muslim leaders who supported Republican Donald Trump to protest against the Biden administration's support for Israel's war in Gaza and attacks on Lebanon have been deeply disappointed by his cabinet picks, they said. 'Trump won because of us and we're not happy with his secretary of state pick and others,' said Rabiul Chowdhury, a Philadelphia investor who chaired the Abandon Harris campaign in Pennsylvania and co-founded Muslims for Trump. Muslim support for Trump helped him win Michigan and may have factored into other swing state wins, strategists believe. Trump picked Republican senator Marco Rubio, a staunch supporter of Israel for Secretary of State. Earlier this year, Rubio said he would not call, opens new tab for a ceasefire in Gaza, and that he believed Israel should destroy 'every element' of Hamas. 'These people are vicious animals,' he added. Trump also nominated Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor and staunch pro-Israel conservative who backs Israeli control of the West Bank and has called a two-state solution in Palestine 'unworkable', as the next ambassador to Israel. He has picked Republican Representative Elise Stefanik, who called the UN a 'cesspool of antisemitism', opens new tab for its condemnation of deaths in Gaza, to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Rexhinaldo Nazarko, executive director of the American Muslim Engagement and Empowerment Network (AMEEN), said Muslim voters had hoped Trump would choose cabinet officials who work toward peace, and there was no sign of that. 'We are very disappointed,' he said. 'It seems like this administration has been packed entirely with neoconservatives and extremely pro-Israel, pro-war people, which is a failure on the on the side of President Trump, to the pro-peace and anti-war movement.' Nazarko said the community would continue pressing to make its voices heard about ending the war in Gaza. 'At least we're on the map.' Hassan Abdel Salam, a former professor at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities and co-founder of the Abandon Harris campaign, which endorsed Green Party candidate Jill Stein, said Trump's staffing plans were not surprising, but had proven even more extreme that he had feared. 'It's like he's going on Zionist overdrive,' he said. 'We were always extremely skeptical ... Obviously we're still waiting to see where the administration will go, but it does look like our community has been played.' The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Several Muslim and Arab supporters of Trump said they hoped Richard Grenell, Trump's former acting director of national intelligence, would play a key role after he led months of outreach to Muslim and Arab American communities, and was even introduced as a potential next secretary of state at events. Another key Trump ally, Massad Boulos, the Lebanese father-in-law of Trump's daughter Tiffany, met repeatedly with Arab American and Muslim leaders. Both promised Arab American and Muslim voters that Trump was a candidate for peace who would act swiftly to end the wars in the Middle East and beyond. Neither was immediately reachable. Trump made several visits to cities with large Arab American and Muslim populations, include a stop in Dearborn, a majority Arab city, where he said he loved Muslims, and Pittsburgh, where he called Muslims for Trump 'a beautiful movement. They want peace. They want stability.' Bill Bazzi, mayor of neighboring Dearborn Heights, who endorsed Trump, said he met the president-elect three times and still believed he would work to end the war, despite the cabinet appointments. Rola Makki, the Lebanese American, Muslim vice chair for outreach of the Michigan Republican Party, agreed. 'I don't think everyone's going to be happy with every appointment Trump makes, but the outcome is what matters,' she said. 'I do know that Trump wants peace, and what people need to realize is that there's 50,000 dead Palestinians and 3,000 dead Lebanese, and that's happened during the current administration.'

Israel pounds Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut with relentless bomb...	Lebanese media reports eight waves of attack on Dahieh district, with multiple hits reported within minutes of each other; further strikes reported in southern Lebanon as IDF advances deeper into Lebanese territory; Islamic Jihad confirms commanders killed in Syria strikes The IDF has carried out eight waves of airstrikes in Beirut's Dahieh district throughout Saturday, according to Hezbollah-affiliated media, as Israel ramps up its attacks on the Hezbollah stronghold. This comes in the backdrop of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group confirming two of their commanders were eliminated in a strike near Damascus that took place on Thursday. Lebanese reports indicated that Israeli airstrikes have intensified in Dahieh, with multiple hits reported within minutes of each other. Local media has claimed that the scope of the destruction in the southern Beirut suburb is reminiscent of the 2006 Lebanon War. One strike reportedly targeted the headquarters of the Supreme Islamic Shiite Council in the Harat Hreik neighborhood. Meanwhile, Lebanese media reported civilian casualties from strikes in various locations. Seven people, including five children, were reportedly killed in an attack on the village of Al-Kharbatha in the Bekaa Valley. In Nabatieh, the death toll from a separate strike rose to five. In Tyre, an airstrike targeting a motorcyclist killed one person and injured another. In a statement, IDF Arabic-language spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee urged residents of 15 villages in southern Lebanon, many of whom have already fled, to evacuate immediately. Adraee warned that the IDF would target areas used by Hezbollah for military operations. At noon, the IDF confirmed additional strikes on southern Lebanon, including rocket launch sites used for attacks on Israel. Over the past day, Israel has attacked more than 160 targets in Lebanon and Gaza, including weapons depots, command centers and launchers, the military said. The Lebanese National News Agency claimed that Israeli forces seized a strategic hill in the village of Shaam, five kilometers from the border, before allegedly destroying a shrine and several homes and later withdrawing. The IDF did not confirm the report. These developments come as Israel pushes deeper into southern Lebanon, with ground forces reportedly advancing to the second line of villages along the border. According to Lebanese media, a firefight occurred at the farthest point reached by Israeli troops in six weeks of ground operations. Meanwhile, rocket fire from Lebanon continued, with the IDF reporting over 35 launches toward northern Israel, including Safed and the Haifa Bay area. Most rockets fell in unpopulated areas or were intercepted. Damage was reported to agricultural structures near Tamra, where livestock were killed and vehicles damaged. Following the intense fighting in Lebanon, two senior Islamic Jihad figures were killed in an Israeli strike on Syria on Thursday, a source from the Palestinian terror group which has fought against Israel in Gaza alongside Hamas told AFP on Saturday. The source said that Abdel Aziz Minawi, a member of Islamic Jihad's political bureau, and the group's foreign relations chief Rasmi Abu Issa were killed in the strike on Qudsaya, in the Damascus area. The strike that took place on Thursday targeted military complexes and Islamic Jihad headquarters at several locations in Damascus and the surrounding countryside. Official Syrian news agency SANA reported of a strike in the Mazzeh neighborhood and later in Qudsaya. The Syrian Defense Ministry reported 15 fatalities and 16 injuries following the strikes. 'Air Force fighter jets, under the direction of IDF Northern Command, struck multiple military structures and Islamic Jihad headquarters in Syria,' The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported shortly after the strike. 'The strike dealt a significant blow to the organization’s headquarters and its operatives. The Islamic Jihad, led by its heads outside the Gaza Strip, carried out the deadly October 7 attack alongside Hamas and has been orchestrating terror activities against the State of Israel since,' it added. According to the Syrian Defense Ministry's official statement released on Thursday, 'At around 3:20 p.m., Israel targeted residential buildings in the Mazzeh neighborhood and the Qudsaya area in rural Damascus. Fifteen were killed and 16 were injured According to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor, the strikes on Thursday in and around Damascus killed 23 people. SANA noted that the strike targeted two residential buildings, while the opposition-affiliated Syrian news site Voice of the Capital reported an apartment was hit in the area. According to reports, the attack took place while Ali Larijani, an advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, was visiting Damascus on a 'special political mission,' as reported by the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen outlet.

Stolen Magen David Adom ambulance prompts police chase in capital, ending with arrest of suspect in his 20s after ramming police car and fleeing on foot A Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance was stolen Saturday morning from Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, prompting a police chase that ended with the arrest of a suspect in his 20s from a village near the city. No injuries were reported in the incident. According to police, the ambulance was spotted driving erratically in a nearby village following a report to the emergency hotline. Officers set up a roadblock and signaled the driver to stop, but the suspect continued onto Highway 1, ramming a police vehicle and causing minor damage. The chase escalated until the suspect abandoned the ambulance and fled on foot. Police apprehended him after a brief pursuit and transferred him to the Moriah station for questioning. Magen David Adom said the incident began when the suspect approached paramedics stationed near the emergency room and suddenly sped off in the ambulance. 'We view any attack on MDA medical teams and ambulances intended for saving lives with the utmost severity,' said MDA Director-General Eli Bin. 'We thank the Israeli police for their swift and determined response, which ensured the ambulance was quickly recovered and public safety maintained. We trust authorities to take all necessary legal action against the suspect.'

Lebanese media mirrors Hezbollah's reluctance to accept cease-fir...	Hezbollah mouthpiece Al-Akhbar squarely rejects Israeli terms, rejecting proposals to involve Lebanese Army in disarming Hezbollah or allow Israel 'operational freedom' under self-defense clause, calling it cover for further aggression Lebanese media aligned with Hezbollah voiced skepticism Saturday over the prospects of a cease-fire agreement with Israel, reflecting the terrorist group's reluctance to accept the terms under discussion. The Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar, known for its ties to Hezbollah, published multiple articles suggesting pessimism over the likelihood of a deal. Sources told the paper that despite ongoing talks, there is little optimism in Lebanon about reaching an agreement. One article by editor Ibrahim al-Amine dismissed Israel's conditions for a cease-fire, accusing it of seeking to dictate terms to Lebanon. 'Israel wants the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL to achieve what it failed to accomplish militarily—disarming Hezbollah operatives south of the Litani River,' he wrote, adding, 'Surrendering to the enemy's demands, directly or indirectly, is not an option that aligns with the sacrifices made.' Another article by Al-Akhbar columnist Yehia Dbouk alleged that Israel seeks a formal agreement to legitimize further strikes. 'There will be no cease-fire dictated by Israel, which is in no position to impose terms,' the article read, criticizing key elements of the cease-fire proposal and suggesting that assigning the Lebanese Army the task of dismantling Hezbollah’s infrastructure south of the Litani River would effectively turn it into an 'Israeli proxy.' Concerns were also raised over provisions allowing Israel to act in 'self-defense,' which the writer argues would legitimize Israeli cross-border operations, including assassinations, abductions and attacks under the guise of security needs. The London-based Asharq Al-Awsat highlighted fears in Lebanon that this clause might grant Israel the 'operational freedom' it has sought, a point that has already faced opposition in Beirut. The Lebanese daily Al-Joumhouria reported that while Hezbollah has refrained from public statements, its priority remains halting Israeli strikes. 'Hezbollah’s stance is that Israel should not gain politically what it failed to achieve militarily,' the paper said. It added that Hezbollah lacks trust in the United States, which it views as a partner in Israeli attacks, and opposes rushing into cease-fire agreements that could lead to further Israeli demands. In contrast, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who negotiates on Hezbollah’s behalf, struck a more optimistic tone. 'The atmosphere is positive, and the work is progressing well,' Berri told Al-Joumhouria. According to the Wall Street Journal, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has approved a cease-fire framework aimed at ending the northern conflict. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer reportedly presented the proposal to Trump during a meeting this week, with Trump expressing hope that the plan could be implemented before his inauguration on January 20. On Thursday, the U.S. presented Lebanon with the draft cease-fire agreement developed in coordination with Israel. President Joe Biden’s special envoy to the region Amos Hochstein reportedly warned Lebanese leaders that he would not return to Beirut unless they demonstrated readiness to finalize the agreement. Hochstein delivered the draft to Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Speaker Berri.

Parodying hostages and hailing Hamas: What’s happening on US camp...	UPenn suspends students for parodying hostage posters with flyers reading 'Missing Cow' and offering 'chalk and beer' as reward; Harvard suspends students for protesting 'Palestinian genocide'; UC Berkeley course lauding Hamas ignites fresh controversy The University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) has suspended the Delta Sigma Phi fraternity for 18 months after its members were found to have posted hundreds of flyers parodying posters of Israeli hostages abducted by Hamas. The flyers, which appeared across campus starting in November 2023, featured designs resembling hostage posters but contained messages like 'Missing Cow' and offered a reward of 'a box of chalk and a can of beer.' A university spokesperson condemned the act as 'crude' and 'deplorable.' While fraternity members claimed the stunt was not antisemitic but rather a 'joke to promote veganism,' UPenn’s administration demanded the group undergo a 'cultural change' as a condition for resuming activities. Meanwhile, Harvard University’s Divinity School suspended several students for two weeks for participating in a library protest last week, framed as a 'pray-in.' Protesters recited texts from the Quran, Torah and New Testament while criticizing what they termed 'Palestinian genocide.' The event also involved distributing posters condemning the university, Chabad and the Hillel Jewish student organization, accusing them of supporting Israel’s war in Gaza. Dean Marla Frederick addressed the suspension in a letter to the university community, writing, 'we honor the importance of prayer and what it represents for so many. And, as one colleague reminded us recently, ‘prayer is protest,’' Frederick wrote. 'In and of itself, advocacy for the cause of people under duress — whether in Israel, Gaza, or other parts of the world — is noble.' However, she clarified that the prayer protest violated university policies prohibiting demonstrations in libraries. 'While some may agree or disagree on the University’s guidelines regarding protest found in the University-Wide Statement on Rights and Responsibilities and their interpretation, they are the rules we currently have and as such we must uphold them,' Frederick wrote. Course promotes pro-Hamas ideology The University of California, Berkeley, is embroiled in controversy surrounding a course accused of promoting pro-Hamas views under the guise of academic study. The class, titled 'Leninism and Anarchism: A Theoretical Approach to Literature and Film,' is part of the Comparative Literature department’s core curriculum. It includes references to Hamas as 'revolutionary resistance forces combating settler-colonialism' and criticizes the 'genocide' of Palestinians by Israel with U.S. backing. The course description originally opened with, 'With the US-backed and -funded genocide being carried out against Indigenous Palestinians by the Israeli Occupying Force, many have found it difficult to envision a reality beyond the one we are living in today.' It praised Hamas’s fight against settler colonialism and posed questions about whether Marxism-Leninism and anarchism could offer a vision for a better future. The syllabus included readings from figures such as Stalin, Lenin and Mao Zedong and promised students an opportunity to 'piece together an archive of Anarchist and Leninist theory.' An Israeli professor at Berkeley criticized the course, calling it 'a seemingly literary course that, in practice, celebrates Hamas under the cover of academia.' He added, 'This is overt political propaganda glorifying violence, in violation of university policies prohibiting the use of classrooms to advance political agendas.' In response to a query from Ynet, Berkeley said, 'The matter is being addressed. The original course description was changed.' A university official added, ' While we can’t, as a matter of law comment on personnel issues, generally speaking we take our policies that prohibit using the classroom for political advocacy very seriously. If/when there is reason to suspect those policies are being violated we respond quickly.' When pressed on specific actions taken, the university cited privacy laws as a reason for withholding further details. This incident follows previous controversies at Berkeley, including a course titled 'Palestine: A Settler-Colonial Analysis,' which faced protests from Jewish organizations for allegedly promoting anti-Israel and antisemitic narratives. That course, previously an elective, was briefly suspended in 2016 before being reinstated with revisions.

Iran and Qatar behind South Africa’s World Court case against Isr...	Report alleges foreign financial and political support in 'genocide' case against Israel; ruling ANC, near bankruptcy, reportedly received major donation from foreign states after filing claim in December A new report by the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy (ISGAP) alleges financial and political involvement by Iran and Qatar in South Africa’s December 2023 case at the International Criminal Court (ICC) accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. According to the New York-based ISGAP, South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC), which was nearing bankruptcy, received substantial donations from the two nations just days after filing the ICC claim. South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola attended the swearing-in of Iranian President Masoud Pezhkian in Tehran last July, the report states. During the visit, Lamola met with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri, who praised him for advancing the ICC case. Bagheri called Lamola 'an innovative diplomat' and reiterated Iran’s full support for South Africa’s role in the legal effort. The report estimates that initiating an ICC case requires approximately $10.5 million, with total legal costs reaching $79 million, necessitating a complex network of international legal experts. ISGAP concludes that such costs suggest significant external funding. Rumors of Iranian involvement have circulated in South Africa, particularly among opposition leaders. However, ANC officials, including President Cyril Ramaphosa, have refused to disclose the origins of a mysterious donation that helped the party recover from nearly $30 million in debt just before filing the case. ISGAP also highlighted a surge in trade between South Africa and Qatar, which grew from $307 million to nearly $1 billion over the past decade, indicating strengthened economic ties. The report suggests Iran views South Africa as a strategic hub to bypass Western sanctions and leverage access to sensitive technologies like satellite interception, hacking and missile guidance. In exchange, South Africa has supported Iran’s inclusion in the BRICS economic bloc, granting Tehran access to international funding despite U.S. sanctions. The report further notes that 45 of the 574 citations in South Africa’s ICC filing came from organizations openly critical of Israel. This raises questions about the case's credibility, ISGAP argues. Among the cited sources is Al-Haq, an NGO designated as a terror organization by Israel, though this classification has been rejected by the U.S. and Europe. Another is the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, led by Raji Sourani, who previously served prison time in Israel for membership in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which is designated as a terror organization by Israel, the U.S., the UK, the EU, Canada, Australia and Japan The ANC and its allies have not commented on the allegations.

Gaza explosions rattle central Israel; scientist explains why	Locals reported hearing loud blasts Friday night, likely stemming from IDF strikes in Gaza, over 40 miles away; why do sounds of blasts from Gaza reach central Israel, how does weather play a role and why are they louder at night? Here’s the explanation Residents of central Israel, including the Gush Dan and Shephelah regions, reported hearing loud explosions Friday night and early Saturday. The IDF confirmed no rocket impacts in the area while police attributed the sounds to explosions originating in Gaza, more than 40 miles away. Dr. Yuval Rosenberg, a physicist at the Davidson Institute of Science Education, explained to Ynet that atmospheric conditions can affect how sound travels, amplifying or diminishing its intensity. 'When the air near the ground is warmer due to the sun heating the surface, sound waves are refracted upward into the sky. This can reduce the noise we hear,' he explained. However, during nighttime, when the ground cools faster than the air above it, sound waves bend back toward the ground. 'This phenomenon is why explosions from Gaza often sound louder in central Israel at night than during the day,' Dr. Rosenberg added. The unique interaction of weather and sound physics highlights why certain noises travel farther or seem more pronounced depending on the time of day and environmental conditions. In addition to explosions heard from Gaza, powerful booms have echoed through the Gush Dan region during the war, caused by rockets detonating over the sea. These loud blasts have sparked anxiety among residents due to their intensity. 'There are many factors that can influence the volume of an explosion we hear, meaning identical rockets detonating can sound vastly different,' explained Dr. Yuval Rosenberg. 'The sound waves we perceive are essentially small disturbances in air pressure, which our brain interprets as sound after they reach our ears and vibrate the eardrum and the rest of our auditory system.' 'When a rocket explodes, it creates a shockwave characterized by a sudden and significant change in air pressure,' explained Dr. Rosenberg. 'At close range, this shockwave can be extremely dangerous, capable of destroying buildings or killing marine life if the detonation occurs at sea. 'As it travels, the shockwave loses energy as it interacts with and is absorbed by objects, creating destruction but also heating the air. Eventually, as it continues over long distances, the shockwave dissipates and transforms into the sound waves we hear. Simply put, a shockwave is like a massive ocean swell that breaks into smaller waves.' Dr. Rosenberg highlighted the difference in how explosion sounds carry over land versus sea. 'For us to clearly hear the explosion, a significant amount of sound waves must reach our ears, or more precisely, the sound wave intensity must remain strong. However, various factors can block sound waves from reaching us. For instance, shockwaves and sound waves can be absorbed by the ground, trees and buildings. Hard surfaces like hills or building walls can also reflect sound waves, preventing them from reaching us,' he said. 'This is why when a rocket explodes on land, there are many obstacles that diminish the volume of the noise we hear. In contrast, over the sea, there are few such barriers, allowing sound waves to travel more freely and reach us more effectively,' he added.

US pilots receive Silver Stars for heroic drone interceptions dur...	Capt. Lacie 'Sonic' Hester, first woman to receive honor, landed under fire with 'hung missile' on her F-15, not knowing if it was 'going to explode on our wing'; her team intercepted over 70 Iranian drones, showing immense composure after exhausting ammunition The U.S. Air Force on Friday awarded Capt. Lacie 'Sonic' Hester and Maj. Benjamin 'Irish' Coffey the Silver Star, America’s third-highest combat honor, for their heroism in intercepting over 70 Iranian drones threatening Israel during Tehran’s assault in April. The operation, conducted by U.S. air and naval forces, unfolded in complete darkness. 'When we were getting our brief to go fly that night, we still had no idea,' Hester told CNN, describing the perilous maneuvers and courage required to counter the drone swarm. 'It could have just been a bust — just another sortie of flying in a circle, waiting for it to happen.' Hester became the first woman in U.S. history to receive the honor—America’s third-highest military decoration for valor in combat. Her mission partner Coffey was also recognized with the same award. Hester’s recognition reignited debate in the United States about women’s roles in combat units. FOX News Pete Hegseth, set to become secretary of defense under President-elect Donald Trump, has criticized women serving in ground combat roles but stated he has 'no issue' with women in aviation roles. Hester and Coffee told CNN they had to improvise during the overnight attack as they attempted to intercept Iranian drones in complete darkness. At one point, Coffey descended his aircraft dangerously low to approach a drone he was tasked with downing. 'You feel the terrain rush, you feel yourself getting closer and closer to the ground. The risk was just too high to try again,' Coffey recounted, admitting the maneuver was unsuccessful. F-15 pilot Lt. Col. Timothy 'Diesel' Causey said that the fighter pilots had not had much time before then to practice. Attack drones 'are a low cost, low risk for the enemy to employ. They can send out massive amounts of them and we have to engage them to protect civilians and to protect our allies,' Causey told CNN. 'We hadn’t started practicing on a large scale yet.' 'You’re talking about something that is on the very edge of a fighter aircraft’s ability to detect — what we call ‘find, fix, track, target and engage,’' Coffey said. 'The best radar in the inventory is in this airplane behind us, and no one really knew whether or not its capability to find these [drones] even existed.' The pilots described another significant challenge: each aircraft could carry only eight air-to-air missiles per sortie, and ammunition was quickly depleted despite spending hours in the air. Lt. Col. Curtis 'Voodoo' Culver, who participated in the interception efforts, said, 'That night, the mission was to shoot down drones with whatever weapons we had available to protect our ally. We ran out of missiles pretty quickly… 20 minutes maybe.' A subsequent critical task was landing back at base for rearming, often under fire or amid falling debris from interceptions. Occasionally, some of the fighter jets, including Coffey and Hester’s, had to land with a 'hung missile' — an emergency situation in which a missile is fired, but malfunctions and doesn’t actually launch. 'This missile — we don’t know if it’s armed, and we don’t know if it’s going to explode on our wing,' Coffey said. 'We don’t know if it’s going to explode while maintenance is safing the aircraft. It’s a big deal. And now, as we start into the landing process, we enter alarm red.' The base had essentially entered a lockdown, signaling an imminent attack, as alarms blared even on the runways 'Missiles and drones are flying over base, and they’re being intercepted over base, so the alarm red goes off,' Causey said. 'Then at that point is really when you see a lot of military discipline and a lot of bravery under fire.' Maj. Clayton 'Rifle' Wicks, who oversaw ground operations for the aircraft during the attack, described the challenges posed by falling debris from intercepts littering the runways. 'Really all we could tell them was stay airborne as long as you can, with the gas that you have. Don’t divert, because even our divert airfields – we don’t know what’s going on there either, so if stuff is blowing up over our heads, very likely stuff is blowing up there too.' While all participating pilots received commendations, only Hester and Coffey were awarded the Silver Star. The pilots emphasized the bravery of ground crews, with Culver recalling a soldier who refueled planes near a truck loaded with fuel and gas while explosions rocked the base. '[T]he courage of that airman, that American, to stand up and do that for an ally, is incredible.' Immediately after the mission, President Joe Biden called to personally commend the pilots. 'Hey, you guys are the best in the whole damn world. That’s not hyperbole. Both these squadrons, you’re incredible,' Biden said, later apologizing for his enthusiasm and joking, 'I’m supposed to be much more reserved.'

Jared Kushner poised to steer Trump’s Middle East agenda behind t...	Trump’s son-in-law will act as a key advisor on Middle East policy despite holding no official role; known for close ties with leaders like Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Kushner’s influence sparks both praise and criticism Jared Kushner, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s son-in-law, is expected to play a key advisory role in shaping the administration’s Middle East strategy, despite not holding an official position, CNN reported on Friday, citing regional diplomats and Trump allies. Trump recently unveiled his Middle East team, naming former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee as the U.S. ambassador to Israel and real estate mogul Steven Witkoff as a special envoy to the region. Still, Kushner’s trusted relationships with Middle Eastern leaders make him a pivotal behind-the-scenes figure, sources said. 'No one on the incoming team has what Jared has, and that is trust,' a diplomat said. His influence, they added, stems from personal connections and trust earned over time, a quality not yet established by other incoming advisors. However, Kushner’s business ties in the region, particularly his close relationship with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, are expected to reignite criticism. During Trump’s first term, Kushner’s investment firm received $2 billion from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. Diplomats have expressed fears that Trump’s administration may prioritize family financial interests over national objectives. A U.S. official described Kushner’s direct ties with Saudi Arabia as troubling, citing private meetings with bin Salman that extended into the night. Kushner’s role is expected to focus on expanding the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab states. Trump and Kushner aim to secure further agreements with additional nations, sources said. In September, Kushner praised the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, calling it the 'most significant event in the Middle East since the Abraham Accords.' He argued that Nasrallah’s death left Iran vulnerable, saying, 'Hezbollah was Iran’s deterrent weapon for 40 years, aimed at Israel. Now, that deterrent is gone.' On Gaza, Kushner has advocated for drastic measures, including relocating Gaza residents to Israel’s Negev Desert during a Harvard panel in March. 'Gaza doesn’t really exist anymore; not much of it is left,' he said, suggesting Israel should use the opportunity to reshape the region. Critics point to Kushner’s controversial past role in drafting Trump’s so-called 'Deal of the Century' peace plan, which proposed land swaps in southern Israel—a move that sparked backlash from Israeli residents. Despite the controversies, Kushner remains a central figure in Trump’s vision for the Middle East, with a unique combination of trust and influence, sources said.

Hezbollah accuses Israel of striking children's TV channel in Leb...	Terror group says Israel struck Taha Kids TV, a children’s channel promoting incitement under innocent-seeming content; group vows strike wouldn’t halt its 'educational mission'; channel previously aired Star of David disappearing under plants Hezbollah issued a rare condemnation on Thursday, accusing the Israeli military of targeting the headquarters of Taha Kids TV, a Lebanese children’s television channel associated with the terrorist group. In a statement, Mohammad Afif, Hezbollah's media relations official, claimed the strike aimed to 'silence a voice that brings joy to innocent children, following attacks on children, schools and nurseries.' The statement also described the alleged attack as a 'violation of international conventions ensuring children’s rights to life, education and security,' adding that it would not deter the channel from its 'educational and humanitarian mission.' Hezbollah called on media outlets and international organizations to denounce the incident. Israel has not commented on the accusations, which remain unverified and based solely on Hezbollah’s claims. Taha Kids TV, a Hezbollah-affiliated channel, broadcasts content designed to promote the group’s ideology under the guise of children’s programming. Widely popular across the Arab world, the channel frequently features themes tied to the Palestinian cause, portraying Israeli actions as 'Zionist crimes' while incorporating content aligned with Iranian-backed narratives. The channel’s material includes songs about Jerusalem, jihad and Palestinian resistance, alongside Shiite religious ceremonies and rituals. One notable video, circulated on Iran’s Quds Day, shows a Star of David being covered by soil and plants until it disappears entirely, accompanied by the caption: 'They see it as far away; we see it as near.' While the channel promotes itself as 'educational and artistic,' with a focus on Islamic and cultural themes, critics argue it is a propaganda tool aimed at indoctrinating children into Hezbollah’s ideology. Taha Kids TV maintains a significant online presence, with over 1.6 million subscribers on YouTube and active accounts across social media platforms. Observers note that the channel’s content blends seemingly innocent entertainment with controversial messaging, further fueling debates over its role in shaping the views of its young audience.

FBI arrests Houston man accused of plotting ISIS-inspired attacks...	Anas Said, 28, allegedly plotted '9/11-style' attack on Jewish and Israeli sites, including synagogues and Israeli consulate; suspect 'openly acknowledged he wants to fight against and kill proponents of Israel' The FBI announced the arrest of Anas Said, 28, of Houston, on charges of distributing ISIS propaganda and planning a terrorist attack on sites linked to Jewish and Israeli communities. Federal prosecutors allege Said 'openly acknowledged that he wants to fight against and kill proponents of Israel.' Said, who was arrested at his Houston apartment last week, faces federal charges of attempting to provide material support to ISIS. According to prosecutors, he admitted to federal agents that he had repeatedly tried to join ISIS abroad, saying he would be willing to travel to Lebanon if released. The U.S. Department of Justice reported that Said offered his home as a 'safe haven' for ISIS operatives. Said’s plans reportedly included violent acts within the U.S., specifically targeting Israeli-affiliated sites and Jewish organizations. Authorities allege he surveilled the security measures and locations of synagogues and the Israeli consulate in Houston. Prosecutors claim Said intended to contact the head of a local Jewish organization to demand an end to support for Israel, with 'violent plans' if the individual refused. During questioning, Said allegedly expressed aspirations for a large-scale attack reminiscent of 9/11. Born in the U.S., Said reportedly moved to Lebanon as a child before returning to the U.S. His mother dismissed the allegations as 'fake news.' Authorities said that Said used social media accounts over the past two years to promote Islamic State content and incite violence. If convicted, Said faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Said’s brother told the FBI that he had openly expressed support for IS and its violent actions for years. 'He didn’t hide his intention to fight against Israel and its supporters,' the brother said.

Israeli fighter jets carried out a third wave of strikes on Beirut’s Dahieh district on Friday, targeting Hezbollah terror headquarters, the IDF said. The military emphasized efforts to minimize civilian harm, citing pre-attack intelligence gathering, precise targeting and advance evacuation warnings. The airstrikes also hit rocket stockpiles and 15 launchers in southern Lebanon, including systems poised to fire on Israel. Among the targets destroyed was the launcher used in Wednesday's rocket attack on central Israel, the military added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bku0rmsz1l	2024-11-15T10:20:44-08:00	
Missiles, intelligence and nukes: Iran’s arms race reaches space	Years after its first satellite launch, Iran runs dual space programs; while promoting civilian goals, the Revolutionary Guard develops spy satellites with Russian support; Western officials warn satellite launch tech mirrors that used for ballistic missiles Iran’s military ambitions are no secret, and its space program reflects its growing capabilities. Over the past two decades, Iran has developed and refined its space technology through two key channels: the Iranian Space Agency and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). While the space agency focuses on civilian projects, the IRGC runs a separate, state-directed program that includes the development of advanced spy satellites and launch vehicles. In recent years, Iran has launched more than 15 satellites, some in collaboration with Russia. Officially, the country claims these launches serve civilian purposes, such as agriculture and research. However, experts warn of a systematic military effort concealed behind this civilian front. The West is particularly alarmed by Iran’s integration of satellite imaging capabilities, missile development and strengthened ties with Russia. These advancements not only enhance Iran’s surveillance and intelligence-gathering abilities but also support its long-range ballistic missile program, raising significant security concerns. Tal Inbar, a missile and space expert, explains Iran’s dual-track approach: 'Iran has a space agency conducting intensified civilian and scientific activities, including developing various satellite launchers and satellites. Most Iranian satellite launchers are based on ballistic missile technology. The program began in the mid-1990s, with the first successful space launch in 2009.' The IRGC, Inbar notes, operates its own separate space initiative: 'The Revolutionary Guard is responsible for designing and launching both satellites and the missiles that carry them. They have conducted several successful launches and also procure surveillance satellites from Russia, with Russian assistance in launching them. At least one is operational, and more launches are planned for the future.' Two militaries, one goal Iran operates two distinct military entities: the Iranian army and the IRGC, each with separate missions. The regular army focuses on defending Iran’s borders from external threats, while the IRGC is tasked with safeguarding the Islamic Revolution and spreading it beyond Iran’s borders. Despite their differing goals, the two forces often collaborate. Over the years, the Iranian army has undergone significant changes, with its leadership aligning closely with the IRGC. Recent Iranian attacks on Israel were carried out by the IRGC, but reports from The Wall Street Journal and Qatar’s The New Arab suggest that the upcoming operation, already dubbed 'True Promise 3' in Iran, could involve the regular army as well, particularly in response to the death of four Iranian soldiers in Israel's strike last October. Breakthrough in Iran’s private space sector Meanwhile, Iran’s space program has seen a new milestone with the emergence of a private sector initiative. Last week at 2:48 a.m. Tehran time, the Iranian private company Space Omid successfully launched its first two satellites into orbit using a Russian-made launcher. The satellites, named Hodhod and Kawthar, were reportedly designed by young Iranian scientists. Kawthar, an observation satellite weighing 30 kilograms, was developed in 2019 and has a lifespan of over three years. It is intended for applications such as agriculture and land surveying. Hodhod, a compact 4-kilogram communication satellite, has a four-year lifespan and supports multiple uses, including agriculture, environmental monitoring, transportation and land surveys. The launch marks a significant step in diversifying Iran’s space program, which has traditionally been dominated by government efforts through the IRGC and other state entities. Academia joins Iran’s space ambitions Iran’s technological universities play a significant role in the country’s space research and development infrastructure, according to Inbar. 'Many satellites have been built at these institutions, ostensibly for civilian purposes,' he said. Experimental space launches involving short-duration flights are also conducted as part of these academic efforts, alongside the development of a suborbital manned spacecraft. Inbar explained that this type of craft reaches space without entering Earth’s orbit. 'All of this is considered part of the civilian activities of the Iranian Space Agency,' he added. Inbar emphasized that Iran’s space programs have not accelerated due to the region’s current tensions but have progressed steadily over years of planning. 'Space programs are not adjusted on short timelines because of a conflict or war,' he said. 'The recent launches are not tied to current tensions—they operate independently of regional circumstances.' Iran became the 43rd country to achieve a presence in space in 2005 with the launch of its first satellite, Sina-1, from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Russia. Since then, the nation has made advancements in satellite technology, providing services such as communication, navigation, scientific research and weather forecasting. After developing key infrastructure and satellite designs, Iran began launching satellites independently, made possible by constructing domestic launch facilities. Among the most notable are the Khomeini Space Center in Semnan, the Qom Space Station, the Alborz Space Center and a new launch site under construction in Chabahar. Iran’s early satellite launches had mixed success. Sina-1, built in Russia at Iran’s request, was successfully launched in 2005 but later veered off course due to technical issues, losing communication with Earth. In 2009, Iran launched Omid ('Hope' in Persian), the first satellite designed and built entirely domestically. The launch, conducted from Semnan, made Iran the ninth country in the world to send an indigenously produced satellite into orbit using a locally developed launcher. Israel was the eighth country to achieve this milestone, doing so in 1988. In 2011, Iran launched the Rasad satellite, designed to provide disaster monitoring, environmental data, meteorology and temperature measurements. According to Hamid Fazeli, the former head of the Iranian Space Agency, Rasad was Iran’s first satellite capable of taking images. However, its mission ended after three weeks when it failed to deliver any photographs. In February 2012, Iran launched the Navid satellite, reportedly tasked with capturing images from 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) above Earth. A second version, the Tadbir satellite, was planned but never succeeded. Navid itself burned up in the atmosphere, and the launch was deemed a failure. Another Iranian satellite, Fajr, was launched in 2015 from the Semnan Space Center using the Safir launcher, capable of carrying small satellites weighing up to 50 kilograms. However, Fajr’s operational life was short-lived. Several other satellites have also faced failed launches, including Tolou 1 from the Imam Khomeini Base in 2017, Payam in 2019, Dousti in 2019 and Zafar 1 in 2020. These setbacks highlight the challenges Iran continues to face in developing a robust space program. Despite these failures, Iran achieved a significant breakthrough in 2020 with the launch of Noor 1, the first satellite developed by the IRGC. Noor 1 orbits Earth every 90 minutes and is capable of surveillance missions. It was launched using the Qased satellite launcher, a new system developed by the IRGC. The program has since expanded with subsequent launches of Noor 2 and Noor 3. Iran-Russia space cooperation The Khayyam satellite, an Iranian satellite built by a Russian company at the request of the Iranian Space Agency, underscores the deepening ties between Tehran and Moscow. Launched into orbit in 2022, Iranian officials claimed the satellite would be used solely for civilian purposes. However, Western officials warned at the time that it could enable Iran to spy on targets in Israel and across the Middle East. Equipped with high-resolution imaging capabilities, Khayyam can capture photos with a resolution of approximately 70 centimeters per pixel. The technology used for satellite launchers could accelerate the timeline for developing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), as both rely on similar technology. Such long-range missiles could eventually carry nuclear warheads. 'The fact that Iran has access to observation satellites with decent resolution and the ability to share this data with its allies in the region is not ideal,' said Inbar. 'There are two aspects to consider: one is infrastructure intelligence, such as monitoring the construction of facilities and bases in Israel, which is valuable for Iran. The second is the potential to deliver near-real-time intelligence under certain conditions.' Another issue lies in the development of satellite launchers. The U.S. has accused Iran of violating United Nations Security Council resolutions with its space launches, asserting that the technology used for satellite launchers could accelerate the timeline for developing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), as both rely on similar technology. Such long-range missiles could eventually carry nuclear warheads. One of the most significant developments in recent years has been the creation of a new satellite launcher by the IRGC, according to Inbar. 'It’s called Qaem 100, with an upgraded version, Qaem 105, in the works,' he explained. 'This satellite launcher uses solid fuel for all its stages—technology that is also used in long-range ballistic missiles capable of reaching distances of 5,000 kilometers or more.' Inbar noted that there is no pressing technological need for a satellite launcher of this kind. 'The fact that it was developed, especially by the IRGC, suggests that it is a way to advance long-range missile technologies under the guise of civilian purposes,' he said. In May, Ali Jafar Abadi, head of the IRGC’s aerospace division, announced that the Qaem 105 would be operational by next spring, calling it 'one of Iran’s most important projects.' He added that the Qaem 105 would be capable of carrying twice the payload of its predecessor, the Qaem 100. According to Inbar, Iran’s financial investment in these areas is driving its progress. 'Iran is allocating significant funds and making advancements,' he said. 'In ballistic missiles, satellite launchers and ground infrastructure, as well as advanced drones, Iran is achieving tangible results.'

Distracted by mobile phone, air traffic controller nearly leads t...	Air Force dismisses reserve air traffic controller and sentences him to 8 days’ detention after probe into last month’s near-collision between 2 armed F-16 jets; military appoints colonel-led inquiry to further investigate incident An Israeli Air Force (IAF) investigation published Friday revealed that a critical procedural lapse by a reserve air traffic controller nearly caused a collision between two armed F-16 fighter jets at Ramat David Airbase last month. The probe found that the controller, who was distracted by his mobile phone, failed to follow standard safety protocols, granting one jet clearance for takeoff while simultaneously allowing another to cross the runway. The near-miss was averted when the pilot of the departing aircraft swerved, avoiding the other jet by just a few hundred feet. One of the jets involved was carrying a brigadier general, who leads the IAF’s strike division, along with three senior officers. Audio from the incident captured the general questioning the control tower: 'Did you see that jet on the runway?' The controller was sentenced to eight days of detention and removed from his position. While some IAF officials criticized the penalty as insufficient given the severity of the safety breach, others defended it, citing the ongoing wartime conditions. The report noted that the controller had a history of professional lapses, which raised concerns among senior officials. 'For far less severe violations, soldiers are often sentenced to longer detention,' one IAF source said. Following the investigation, the IAF implemented immediate safety measures and enhanced oversight at control towers. The Air Force commander has also appointed a colonel to lead a broader inquiry into the incident. 'The investigation yielded actionable lessons, which were promptly applied,' the military said in a statement, emphasizing that operations resumed quickly after the incident.

France appeals court ruling allowing Israeli firms at defense sho...	Paris appeals court ruling permitting Israeli companies to participate in defense exhibitions, aiming to block their involvement in future events; Israeli Manufacturers Association vows to fight appeal, calling it discriminatory and inconsistent with democratic values The French government on Friday filed an appeal against a court ruling that permitted Israeli companies to participate in defense exhibitions, following controversy and criticism of President Emmanuel Macron over the initial ban. The move aims to block Israeli firms from taking part in future defense events, including the prestigious Paris Air Show. The appeal, submitted by a government representative for the Paris Prefect of Police, challenges the administrative court’s authority to decide on French government policy. The court’s earlier decision had overturned a prohibition on Israeli companies exhibiting at events such as the recent Euronaval maritime defense show. Although Euronaval concluded last week, the French government’s appeal seeks to prevent Israeli participation in upcoming exhibitions, with the Paris Air Show — one of the world’s largest defense and aerospace events — likely at the forefront of its concerns. In late October, the court ruled decisively in favor of a petition by the Israeli Manufacturers Association, Israel Shipyards and the Israel-France Chamber of Commerce, allowing Israeli firms to participate in Euronaval. In response to the appeal, the Manufacturers Association announced it would continue to fight the French government’s efforts to exclude Israeli companies. 'We regret that French leaders have failed to grasp the message from previous cases: we will not allow anyone to remove or sideline us from the international defense stage,' said Dr. Ron Tomer, president of the Manufacturers Association of Israel. 'Israel is a proud sovereign state, equal to any other in the global community, and we would expect that a country like France, which shares democratic values with Israel, including principles of equality and justice, would not discriminate against Israeli companies compared to those from other nations.' Tomer criticized the appeal as an attempt to set the stage for excluding Israeli companies from the Paris Air Show, adding, 'We have retained top legal experts in France and will fight in every court necessary to ensure justice and equality. The Israeli flag will proudly fly at every exhibition.'

IAEA chief visits two nuclear sites during Iran trip	Grossi visits the Natanz nuclear plant and the Fordow enrichment site, which is dug into a mountain around 100 km (60 miles) south of the capital Tehran The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog visited two Iranian nuclear sites on Friday as part of a visit to Iran, ahead of an expected European diplomatic push over Tehran's atomic activities before Donald Trump's return to the White House. Earlier International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi met with Iran's president Masoud Pezeshkian. During the visit, Iran's foreign minister told Grossi that Tehran is willing to resolve outstanding disputes over its nuclear program but won't succumb to pressure. Grossi visited the Natanz nuclear plant and the Fordow enrichment site, which is dug into a mountain around 100 km (60 miles) south of the capital Tehran, state media reported, without giving details. Relations between Tehran and the IAEA have soured over several long-standing issues including Iran barring the agency's uranium-enrichment experts from the country and its failure to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites. 'The ball is in the EU/E3 court,' Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi wrote on X following talks in Tehran with Grossi on Thursday, referring to three European countries - France, Britain and Germany - which represent the West alongside the United States at nuclear talks. 'Willing to negotiate based on our national interest and inalienable rights, but not ready to negotiate under pressure and intimidation,' Araqchi said. Trump's return to office as U.S. president in January upends nuclear diplomacy with Iran, which had stalled under the outgoing administration of Joe Biden after months of indirect talks. During Trump's previous tenure, Washington ditched a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers that curbed Tehran's nuclear work in exchange for relief from international sanctions. Trump has not fully spelled out whether he will continue his 'maximum pressure' policy on Iran when he takes office. The U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear pact in 2018 and the reimposition of sanctions prompted Tehran to violate limitations on its uranium enrichment - seen by the West as a disguised effort to develop nuclear weapons capability. Tehran is now enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to the roughly 90% required for an atom bomb. Tehran says its nuclear work is purely for peaceful purposes.

Dahieh destruction equal to 2006 war'; watch building destroyed ...	Officials in Beirut estimate total rebuild cost for Lebanon after the war could reach three billion dollars and take up to five years; IDF carries out repeated strikes on Beirut's Hezbollah stronghold The IDF on Friday afternoon posted another warning to the residents of Beirut's Dahieh quarter to leave the area ahead of an Israeli strike on the Hezbollah stronghold. The IDF carried out at least six bombings of the sector of Lebanon's capital in the morning hours after warning civilians away. Buildings were taken down in the attacks. According to a report in the Hezbollah-affiliated Al Akhbar newspaper the damage to the Dahieh so far, is estimated to be $630 million while the cost of rebuilding all areas of the country, damaged in Israeli attacks could reach three billion dollars. This is equal to the damage at the end of the 2006 Second Lebanon War. Al Akhbar said that in the previous war some 246 buildings were destroyed in the Dahieh while as of the end of October 2024, some 220 buildings were already destroyed. Lebanese officials estimated that rebuilding after the fighting ends could take three to five years. Israeli security officials said they believed Hezbollah and the caretaker government in Beirut would not agree to Israel's demand for freedom to operate in Lebanon if the agreement under negotiations. Israel did agree for Lebanese army troops to be armed by the U.S., France and Britain who will be guarantors to the agreement and partners to its enforcement. Israeli and American officials said an agreement could be reached within weeks and a draft of the deal was delivered to Lebanon's prime minister and the speaker of parliament who is negotiating on behalf of Hezbollah. Officials in Jerusalem remained skeptical about the Lebanese military's ability to act against the Iran-backed terror group despite Washington's confidence that they would succeed. The level of trust in Lebanon's troops is low. Hezbollah, the officials say, was be able to carry on the fighting and would not rush to accept a deal. In the meantime, the IDF continued its military pressure and its efforts to remove as many of Hezbollah's capabilities as possible. On Friday, Hezbollah fired rockets at Haifa and its surrounding areas twice since the morning hours and the Galilee was also repeated under attack. Sources confirmed to the Qatari Al Araby al Jadeed channel on Friday that a draft of the agreement under negotiations was delivered to Beirut. 'The American mediation has made no progress on a cease-fire between Hezbollah and Israel, the channel said. 'Lebanon rejects any IDF freedom to operate in its territory after an agreement is agreed. Hezbollah refused German participation in the countries overseeing the deal.' Mukati and Berri met with Ali Larijani, the visiting Iranian official who said Iran stands with Lebanon's government, its military and Hezbollah against Israel's aggression. 'We will support any decision taken by Hezbollah and the government in Beirut,' Larijani said. 'We want to solve problems and Netanyahu wants to destroy things. Hezbollah is strong and the Lebanese are great people and we support the resistance.

IDF calls on residents of Dahieh to leave, for second time Friday	The IDF posted a second warning on Friday for residents of Beirut's Dahieh quarter to leave for safety ahead of attacks on the Hezbollah stronghold. The warning came during a visit of a senior aid to Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei who arrived in Beirut after a visit to Damascus.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj1e1h4gje	2024-11-15T02:24:39-08:00	
Canadian Groups Accuse Pro-Israel Charities of ‘War Crimes'	Five pro-Israel Canadian charities are accused of supporting settler violence in a report, a claim mainstream Jewish organizations argue stokes antisemitism and requires government intervention A consortium of anti-Zionist groups operating in Canada has launched a campaign to discredit five charitable organizations supporting Israel. At a press conference held in Toronto this past Friday, Independent Jewish Voices Canada (IJV Canada) and Just Peace Advocates released a report accusing pro-Israel charities of aiding and abetting terrorism and war crimes. Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur for the Palestinian territories, spoke at the event alongside the report’s co-author, Miles Howe, assistant professor of critical criminology at Brock University; Khaled Mouammar, Palestinian-Canadian founder of the Canadian Arab Federation; Anver Emon, professor of law and history at the University of Toronto; and Alice Klein, a member of IJV Canada. The report, titled 'Under the Guise of Charity: Canadian Funding for War Crimes in Occupied Palestine,' targets five Canadian charities that support Israel, including the Mizrachi Organization of Canada and the Jewish Heritage Foundation of Canada. It alleges that these groups are violating Canadian tax law by using funds to engage in settler violence and land expropriation and to incentivize military enlistment in Israel. Richard Marceau, vice president and general counsel for the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs in Ottawa, said that the event was part of an attempt by left-wing organizations to smear mainstream Jews. 'The thinking goes that if you are pro-Israel, you are pro-genocide,' he said. Marceau described IJV Canada, which supports the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement, as a fringe organization associated with antisemites. The ultimate aim of IJV and similar groups is to 'scare Jews from engaging with the Jewish community and organizations through bullying and harassment,' Marceau said. Canadian laws regarding charitable giving are significantly more stringent than equivalent laws in the United States. This week, the Jewish National Fund’s Canadian branch (JNF Canada) lost an appeal to retain its charitable status, prompting jubilation in pro-Palestinian circles. An audit by the Canadian Revenue Agency, the local equivalent of the IRS, found that JNF Canada was illegally supporting the Israeli military and Israeli activities in the West Bank. For as long as any Canadian charities are allowed to fund illegal settler groups and the Israeli army, we’ll be continuing to push on this file Corey Balsam, national coordinator of IJV Canada, said that 1,200 people tuned into the livestreamed press conference. He said that the media has been reluctant to cover the investigation of pro-Israel charities. 'We’re hoping this will serve as a bit of a turning point,' he said. IJV Canada has been working on getting its report into the hands of public officials and pursuing policy options, Balsam noted. 'For as long as any Canadian charities are allowed to fund illegal settler groups and the Israeli army, we’ll be continuing to push on this file,' he said. Rabbi Steven Wernick, who serves the Beth Tzedec Congregation not far from where the press conference was held, said that antisemitism has been on the rise in Canada. 'Increased security measures are costing us $200,000 more a year. We see what’s happening in the streets,' Wernick told The Media Line. He said it was 'disconcerting' that Jews were involved in the leadership of some of the anti-Zionist groups attempting to delegitimize Jewish charities. 'It will be a test of the CRA to see if it falls prey to insidious attacks,' he said. Wernick noted that 90% of Jews in Toronto identify as Zionists. Canada is currently home to around 390,000 Jews, making it the fourth-largest Jewish community in the world after Israel, the US, and France. About 200,000 of Canada’s Jews live in Toronto, including a particularly high concentration of Holocaust survivors. Lynda Kraar, one Jewish resident of Toronto, recalled learning the lesson from her Holocaust survivor parents that antisemitism never disappears but only goes underground. 'With antisemitism, it’s not a question of if but when,' she said. You want to attack me because I’m a Jew? I’ve got news for you. I know what antisemitism is and I’m not willing to allow it to happen again. A Holocaust memoir written by Kraar’s mother was published by the Azrieli Foundation, an organization that is now vulnerable to having its charitable status revoked in Canada. 'You want to attack me because I’m a Jew? I’ve got news for you. I know what antisemitism is and I’m not willing to allow it to happen again,' Kraar said. Marceau said that Canadian antisemitism has three main sources: the far right, the far left, and Islamism. One form of antisemitism in some left-wing circles involves denying that antisemitism is a real form of oppression, he said. This past July, lawmaker Anthony Housefather was appointed as special adviser on Jewish community relations and antisemitism. Housefather has been a vocal and relentless defender of Canadian Jews and Israel, sometimes opposing stances taken by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. 'There has been no time in my lifetime when Jewish Canadians have felt as threatened as they do today,' Housefather said in his acceptance speech. Trudeau, who has often upset the Canadian Jewish community with his harsh statements about Israel’s actions in the ongoing war, described Canadian antisemitism as 'terrifying' in a statement last month. 'We have seen Jewish schools in Montreal shot at, synagogues firebombed, Jewish community centers picketed, bomb threats in Jewish schools in Toronto,' Marceau said. 'The Montreal Jewish community asked and got an injunction for 34 institutions to have demonstrations not allowed within 100 meters from them. For an injunction to be granted is quite an extraordinary thing.' Anti-Israel activists also picketed Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto and displayed Hamas and Hezbollah flags at various educational institutions, Marceau added. He said his organization is ready to take on IJV Canada and Just Peace Advocates. 'The Canadian government should be looking at those groups in Canada that are openly racist, preaching violence, spreading toxicity and hate, and tearing apart the social fabric,' he said.

Islamic Jihad posts new video of hostage Sasha Trufanov	Trufanov's family has not yet approved publication of the video; clip comes two days after an earlier video is released in which the hostage refers to himself as a prisoner; he speaks to his family and describes the difficulty of over a year in captivity The Islamic Jihad terror group in Gaza on Friday posted a new video of hostage Sacha trufanov held since his abduction last October. The video came two days after an earlier clip was released, as part of the PIJ's psychological warfare. Trufanov is seen near a picture of Ultra-Orthodox lawmaker and leader of the Shas Party Aryeh Deri. His family has not yet approved publication of the video or its contents. In the earlier clip released on Wednesday Sasha addresses his family and talks about the difficulty of the long time in captivity. 'A year that I have been here in captivity, a year in which there is a shortage of food and water, no electricity. Now even basic hygiene products, such as soap and shampoo, have run out. I have a skin problem that did not exist before because of this situation. I want to remind the citizens of Israel, every time you eat something or drink something, remember us hostages, we don't have this opportunity to enjoy the food and water you eat or drink,' he said. He speaks of himself as a 'prisoner' and also referred to the suffering of the citizens in Gaza. 'When you make it difficult for them, you also make it difficult for us,' he said.

Trump ally Musk meets with Iranian officials, report	Iranian officials say Trump win could be an opportunity to change in tone in U.S. Iran relations hoping for a deal to be made; Iranian foreign minister says nuclear talks can proceed with courage and good will Elon Musk met with Iran's ambassador to the UN Amir Saeid Iravani on Monday in New York, the New York Times said late on Thursday, citing two Iranian officials. The meeting lasted more than an hour and was held at a secret location. It was described as 'positive' and 'good news.' According to one of the Iranian officials, it was Musk who had requested the meeting and the ambassador picked the site. Musk did not respond to questions from the Times. 'We do not comment on reports of private meetings that did or did not occur.' Trump's communications director Steven Cheung said. Karoline Leavitt, the transition spokeswoman for the incoming Trump-Vance administration, said in a statement: 'The American people re-elected President Trump because they trust him to lead our country and restore peace through strength around the world. When he returns to the White House, he will take the necessary action to do just that.' The Iranian officials told the Times that the meeting was an opportunity for Iran to avoid sitting directly with an American official, although Musk will soon join the new administration as co-director of a government efficiency agency that is planned. An official in Iran's Foreign Ministry said that Ambassador Iravani suggested that Musk should obtain sanctions exemptions from the U.S. Treasury and bring some of his businesses to Tehran. Iran’s mission to the United Nations said it would not publicly comment on the meeting. 'An early direct meeting between a senior Iranian official and Mr. Musk raises the possibility of a change in tone between Tehran and Washington under the Trump administration, despite a charged history between the president-elect and Iran,' the New York Times wrote. During his campaign Trump criticized the Biden administration for lifting sanctions on Iran, that were part of Trump's 'maximum pressure' campaign during his first term as president. Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal and imposed severe economic sanctions. He was also the president who gave the order to assassinate Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps chief Qasem Soleimani in 2020. In September Trump said the U.S. must make a deal with Iran adding he would have been ready to reach an agreement with Iran within a week after the elections were he reelected in 2020. ' I would’ve made a fair deal with Iran. I was gonna get along with Iran. The deal was simple: Iran can’t have a nuclear missile. It cannot have that nuclear capability,' he said. Iran was also behind an attempt to assassinate Trump recently but after he won the elections, some in Iran, including officials who spoke to the paper said his term could be used as a diplomatic opportunity and that a deal, could be reached with him adding that the president-elect like succeeding in deals where others have failed. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Arghachi said in a post last Thursday that differences could be resolved through cooperation and dialogue. 'We agreed to proceed with courage and good will. Iran has never left the negotiation table on its peaceful nuclear program,' he said in a post on X after a meeting in Tehran with IAEA chief Rafael Grossi.

European antisemitism surges: Dutch police continue to arrest pro...	Pro-Palestinian rioters were being detained by Dutch authorities under the country's emergency ban on protests It’s been almost a week since antisemitic violence erupted in the streets of Amsterdam, where Israeli soccer fans were targeted and attacked. Dutch police continue to arrest pro-Palestinian protesters who are defying the protest ban in the Netherlands. On Thursday, for the fifth day in a row, pro-Palestinian rioters were being detained by Dutch authorities under the country's emergency ban on protests. Amsterdam imposed the ban following a violent attack on Israeli soccer fans in the city. The victims, including women and children, were ambushed by mobs of Dutch immigrants, primarily from North Africa, in an assault that left five people hospitalized with severe injuries. After widespread condemnation from European leaders over the attacks on Israelis and Jews, many Dutch residents used the unrest as an opportunity to defy the law and participate in anti-Israel protests. Since last week's clashes, Dutch police have detained hundreds of demonstrators under the new emergency measures. With antisemitism on the rise across Europe, reactions have been deeply divided. Many have expressed outrage at the escalating violence, while others openly welcome it, as evidenced by social media posts and actions on the streets of Amsterdam.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1gti5vfye	2024-11-15T00:42:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/11/14/rJezowQz1l/rJezowQz1l_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Trump could destroy Iran’s nukes, bring peace with Saudi Arabia. ...	Shiri Fein-Grossman: Israel’s current objective in Lebanon is to eliminate as many Hezbollah operatives as possible The Trump administration could deter Iran, inflict substantial damage on the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, and join forces with Israel to destroy the country’s nuclear program. The key question is how far the Trump administration is willing to go, according to Shiri Fein-Grossman, former head of the Foreign Policy Branch, Regional Affairs in the National Security Council. If Trump achieves some or all of these goals, 'that would signal to Saudi Arabia that America is willing to use force to stem Iran, to support its allies in the region, and it would create a new reality in the Middle East,' Fein-Grossman said. 'Without that, it will be very hard to bring Saudi Arabia to the table without talking about the Palestinian issue, the two-state solution that Saudi Arabia is still hoping to achieve.' Fein-Grossman spoke to ILTV News on Thursday. She told the station that Israel’s current objective in Lebanon is to eliminate as many Hezbollah operatives as possible and destroy as many of the group’s rockets as it can before the war is halted by a ceasefire. However, she added that the bigger question is what happens the day after: Will Israel have the freedom to act when it perceives a credible threat? 'What’s stalling getting to a ceasefire now is the Israeli freedom to act whenever it sees a threat,' she said. 'The main thing is, what will happen the day after? Will Israel be able to maintain its own security for the first time?'

The rise of 'born-again' Jews	Julie Platt on 'the surge' of Jews returning to their roots, showing up in numbers the American Jewish community hasn’t seen in years Since the October 7 massacre in Israel, there has been a rise in 'born-again Jews,' according to Julie Platt, chairwoman of the Jewish Federations of North America. 'We speak a lot about ‘the surge’ since October 7,' she told ILTV News earlier this week. 'There are many, many born-again Jews who remembered who they were, remembered their affiliation, their religion, and their community. People are showing up in numbers we haven't seen in quite some time. 'But it's on us, the Jewish community, to make them feel welcome, help them find their place, and foster a sense of belonging,' Platt added. On October 7, approximately 6,000 Hamas terrorists and Gazan civilians infiltrated Israel, slaughtering 1,200 people and kidnapping over 250 others. Since then, antisemitism has surged worldwide, even striking communities that once believed they were immune. Speaking from the Jewish Federations’ General Assembly, Platt said the 2,500 attendees focused heavily on community engagement as a critical part of combating antisemitism. 'We have to remember who our partners are—those we may not have been in conversation with—and work hard to strengthen our allied communities,' she said. For the first time, JFNA hosted a panel featuring Christian supporters of Israel. The evangelical Christian community has long been pro-Israel, rooted in the biblical passage from Genesis 12:3, where God says, 'I will bless those who bless you.' However, more liberal segments of the Jewish community have often been hesitant to partner with Christians, citing differences in values and fears of proselytizing. Since October 7, however, many Jews have become more open to these alliances, recognizing the need for all of Israel’s friends. 'We had many allied communities here,' Platt noted. 'One of the most impactful for me was the Native American ally community, which wanted to be here to stand with us. The Christian community has consistently been by our side, with voices like [American actress and producer] Patricia Heaton and many ministers, reverends, and clergy across the country. We need to appreciate and grow that support, and we were proud to give it a voice here.' While identifying new supporters of Israel and the Jewish people, Platt emphasized that the Federation’s work is far from over. The organization has already distributed more than $700 million of the $850 million raised to support Israel since the war began. 'We're all aware that this is a long game, and we can’t rest until Israel is recovered, rebuilt, and as strong as it can be,' Platt said. 'This moment has re-energized us to continue the work ahead.' One of the top priorities, she said, will be addressing the mental health needs of Israelis. 'There is not an Israeli citizen who hasn’t been affected by trauma,' Platt stressed. 'Sadly, through this conflict, I don’t think we’ve even begun to address the trauma, stress, and mental health services we must provide. And then there’s 100 more things.' Families of the 101 hostages still held in Gaza participated in the event, sharing their stories and urging action to bring their loved ones home. Although no government representatives attended, President Isaac Herzog was present, along with many leaders from Israeli nonprofits and other organizations. Platt emphasized that the responsibility for the hostages weighs heavily on the American Jewish community—'not just as a collective, but name by name, person by person.'

Trump approves outline of pending cease-fire deal in Lebanon	Incoming president hopes agreement would be implemented before he takes office; officials in Washington and Jerusalem await Lebanon's response to the outline of the deal President elect Donald Trump gave his approval to the outline of the agreement being negotiated to bring a cease-fire to the fighting between Israel and the Hezbollah terror group in Lebanon, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. Israeli officials told the paper that Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, presented the outline of the agreement to Trump in their meeting last week and the incoming president expressed him hope that the agreement could come into effect before he took office on January 20, 2025. The U.S. presented the outline to the government in Beirut on Thursday. Officials in Washington and in Jerusalem were awaiting their reply that could, according to the Israeli officials, come within days. U.S. President Joe Biden's special envoy, Amos Hochstein told the Lebanese that he would not arrive to Beirut if he did not believe the government there was prepared to seal the deal. Hochstein gave the head of Lebanon's caretaker government Najib Mukati and Speaker of parliament Nabih Berri, who was negotiating on behalf of Hezbollah, the draft of the agreement. According to a report in the Lebanese Al Jadeed channel, Berry delivered Lebanon's response and was 'optimistic about a cease-fire within days or a week,' but that report was removed quickly. The Hezbollah-affiliated Al Akhbar newspaper on Thursday reported that Berri and Mukati rejected Israel's demands for freedom to operate in Lebanon if the agreement that would be reached, would be violated and Hezbollah would return to South Lebanon or rebuild its military capabilities. The Lebanese demands, according to the report was an immediate cease-fire and the return of residents of the south to their villages, a complete withdrawal of all Israeli troops from the south and a ban on any IDF activity on Lebanese territory on land, in the air or at sea. Beirut's demand was also that there would be no amendment to UN resolution 1701 passed at the end of the 2006 Second Lebanon war. The IDF meanwhile continued its offensive in South Lebanon, operating in the second line of villages away from the Israeli border, to remove Hezbollah's capabilities to fire missiles and rockets at Israel. The IDF conducted more airstrikes on the Dahieh quarter in Beirut after repeated attacks there in recent days. The military said it was targeting Hezbollah weapons stores and production facilities. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held consultations with Dermer, Defense Minister Israel Katz and with his far-right coalition partners Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich to discuss both the Lebanon and Gaza fronts.

Exclusive - ‘Taken Us Back 200 Years’: Gazan Workers Blame Hamas	Gazan's who worked in Israel share stories of hardship amid devastation in the Strip, with lives and jobs lost under siege and war and reflect on past stability and the worsening crisis as conflict and shortages continue As Gaza endures its worst humanitarian crisis in decades, former Gazan workers who once relied on jobs in Israel are grappling with devastating loss and a future filled with uncertainty. Entire neighborhoods have been leveled, and much of Gaza’s infrastructure is in ruins as Israel’s intensified military campaign, coupled with an already crippling blockade, has left the Strip’s 2.3 million residents in dire straits. Sami, one of the displaced workers, describes how war has stripped away everything familiar: 'It is unbearable. Today, life is impossible. People don’t know how to cope. There is no money, no food. Everyone knows it. When a kilo of onions costs 60 shekels, it’s a catastrophe.' He noted that, while in Israel, he worked with both Arab and Jewish Israelis. He said some Jewish colleagues were surprised to work with a Gazan, but it did not prevent mutual interactions. 'When they asked how I got in, I explained that I had a permit,' he told The Media Line. 'We are clean people with no connections to Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Fatah, or any other organization. In Gaza, we worked honestly to support our families.' 'This is the result of having bad Islamists in power for years, like Hamas, and it has dragged us back 200 years,' Sami says, expressing frustration with the governing group in Gaza and the toll of ongoing hostilities. 'Israel also bears responsibility for our suffering. I have been imprisoned in Israeli jails, and we are caught in a never-ending cycle of violence. Now, we fight for scraps of bread and live in tents.' The escalating violence has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes, leaving many internally displaced and facing life in makeshift shelters. Originally from Amman, Sami recalled being caught at the border when hostilities erupted, unable to return home. 'The war started while I was at work,' he explaines. 'We wanted to leave. We didn’t know what to do because there were no crossings open.' After being detained by Israeli authorities for a month, Sami returned to Gaza to find that his home had been destroyed and that his wife and daughter were among those killed. Until recently, cross-border employment provided an economic lifeline for thousands of Gazans, many of whom worked in Israel’s construction and agricultural sectors. In 2021, 7,000 Gazans held Israeli work or trade permits. The following year, the permit quota was increased to 17,000, with a planned increase to 20,000. By 2023, 18,500 Palestinians had visas to enter Israel, but their access was revoked three days after the Hamas attack. Riyadh, 28, who was born in Turkey, has been living in the southern part of the Strip. He has not seen his father Sami for nine months during the war. He was a medical clown in Gaza and worked in Israel as a painter for 19 days before he got married. Fifteen days later, the war began. His 16-year-old wife was killed during the conflict. Riyadh strongly condemns Hamas for this. 'They started the war on October 7. If they had not initiated this, nothing would have happened,' he says. For Gazans like Sami, these jobs were essential, providing a steady income in a territory plagued by soaring unemployment and poverty. 'I had a permit and was officially employed in Israel,' he recalls, noting he earned approximately 500 shekels a day—a salary that allowed him and his family to live relatively comfortably. While the majority of workers have either fled Gaza or been killed, The Media Line was able to speak to a businessman who, for security reasons, is not being identified. He has two decades of experience in major industries in Gaza—and is now facing his fourth displacement. 'The period before the war was a symbol of good exchange and cohesion between the two sides. I had great hopes for the future and to continue like this,' he says. 'October 7 has destroyed all our dreams and communication on both sides. We blame both Israel and Hamas. They must stop the war immediately.' When asked why he hadn’t left the Strip, he says that he had 'many chances' to do so. He noted that he had been to 'the United States, China, and other places' but said he 'couldn’t leave' Gaza. 'Even after visiting Ramallah, I couldn’t stay there more than four days and had to return to Gaza,' he says. 'We will not leave; this is our land. I want a chance to live like everyone else. My message to the world is that I hope what I am enduring, along with the suffering of my people and children, will never happen again in history.' Hasan, another longtime worker, shares similar experiences from his 20-year tenure in a block factory in Israel, where he found stability and enough income to support his family in Gaza. 'It was generally good, and I earned enough to live a dignified life in Gaza,' he says. 'But now, we live like animals. This is the result of having bad Islamists in power, like Hamas. Israel also bears responsibility for our suffering.' Before this latest escalation, Gaza’s labor force had built a fragile but vital relationship with Israeli employers, bridging the gap between the two sides through economic interdependence. For some, this work symbolized a rare opportunity for interaction that transcended the usual hostilities. While many in Gaza hold Hamas responsible for the conflict, others, like Sami, are outspoken in their criticism of the group’s leadership. 'This is not a national movement; it is a betrayal,' he declares. Hasan echoed these sentiments, saying, 'We brought this on ourselves by creating groups like Hamas, who claim to represent Islam but know nothing of it. To me, the Jews are better than the Muslims ruling us here. ... True Islam would never justify their actions.'

Pro-Israel activists rally at Capitol, calling out Tlaib and Omar...	Wearing shirts calling for return of Israeli hostages, US Betar activists blast Progressive lawmakers for refusal to condemn terror group's violence; Omar hurls expletive at protesters in response Pro-Israel activists from the American branch of the Betar movement staged a protest at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, wrapped in Israeli flags and confronting Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar over their alleged support for Hamas following the terrorist group’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel. The activists wore shirts advocating for the release of hostages and knocked on the congresswomen’s doors, attempting to deliver pagers as symbolic 'gifts.' In response, Rep. Omar reportedly hurled an expletive at them. Rep. Tlaib summoned Capitol Police, who questioned the activists and confiscated the devices, which were presented as pagers in reference to a spree of detonations of explosive-laced pagers that killed dozens of Hezbollah operatives and maimed thousands of others in September. The protesters then followed Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, confronting her with questions about her alleged refusal to condemn Hamas and accusing her of supporting the organization despite its violence. One activist took a selfie with Omar, who smiled but was questioned by the activist, 'Why are you happy?' Another protester shouted, 'At least I don’t sleep with my brother,' referencing a long-disputed, unproven claim about Omar’s past marriage. Another shouted, 'Go to Gaza,' to which Omar reportedly replied, 'F*** you.' In a statement, Betar said, 'We went to Congress to confront jihadists, and Ilhan Omar told us to ‘go f*** ourselves,’ while Rashida Tlaib, who advocates defunding the police, called the police on us.

Trump selects Robert F Kennedy Jr to lead HHS, top US health agen...	President-elect Donald Trump announced on Thursday he has selected Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental activist who has spread misinformation on vaccines, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, the United States' top health agency. Kennedy ran for president in this year's election as an independent before dropping out in August and endorsing Trump in exchange for a role in the Republican's administration. The Department of Health and Human Services oversees the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health and the massive Medicare and Medicaid Services programs, which provide health coverage for the poor, those aged 65 and older, and the disabled.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjsrdlvgke	2024-11-14T13:21:51-08:00

Ben & Jerry's says sues Unilever for silencing its support of Pal...	According to lawsuit, 'Ben & Jerry's has on four occasions attempted to publicly speak out in support of peace and human rights. Unilever has silenced each of these efforts'; lawsuit will make it harder for Unilever to sell the brand Ice cream brand Ben & Jerry's said in a lawsuit filed Wednesday that parent company Unilever has silenced its attempts to express support for Palestinian refugees and threatened to dismantle its board and sue its members over the issue. The lawsuit is the latest sign of the long-simmering tensions between Ben & Jerry's and consumer products maker Unilever, which is planning to spin out its ice cream business next year. The spin out would include the top-selling Vermont-based maker of Chubby Hubby, although experts on corporate governance said the brand's board, a centerpiece of the new lawsuit, could present challenges to the deal. A rift first erupted between Ben & Jerry's and Unilever in 2021 after the ice cream maker said it would stop selling its products in the West Bank because it was inconsistent with its values, a move that led some investors to divest their shares in Unilever. The ice cream maker then sued Unilever for selling its business in Israel to its licensee there, which allowed marketing in the West Bank and Israel to continue. That lawsuit was settled in 2022. In its new lawsuit, Ben & Jerry's says that Unilever has breached the terms of the 2022 settlement, which has remained confidential. As part of the agreement, however, Unilever is required to 'respect and acknowledge the Ben & Jerry's independent board's primary responsibility over Ben & Jerry's social mission,' according to the lawsuit. But, according to the lawsuit, 'Ben & Jerry's has on four occasions attempted to publicly speak out in support of peace and human rights. Unilever has silenced each of these efforts.' In response to Reuters' story, Unilever said in an emailed statement: 'Our heart goes out to all victims of the tragic events in the Middle East. We reject the claims made by B&J’s social mission board, and we will defend our case very strongly.' 'We would not comment further on this legal matter,' it added. The lawsuit was filed Thursday in New York federal court. Minor Myers, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law, said the tension between Ben & Jerry's and Unilever would be top of mind in a deal, particularly if Unilever's ice cream brands are acquired by a private equity firm or competitor company. 'The Ben & Jerry's situation, would be front of mind of any possible buyer,' Myers said. 'To the extent that Ben & Jerry's or a subsidiary wants to be liberated to say (what they want, it) may impact the sales of the flagship ice cream brand.' That would result in a lower valuation for Unilever's ice cream brands, Myers said. There are fewer concerns if the ice cream brands become a separate publicly traded company, Myers said. Ben & Jerry's said in the lawsuit it has tried to call for a ceasefire, support the safe passage of Palestinian refugees to Britain, back students protesting at U.S. colleges against civilian deaths in Gaza, and advocate for a halt in U.S. military aid to Israel, but has been blocked by Unilever. The independent board separately spoke out on some of those topics, but the company was muzzled, the lawsuit says. Ben & Jerry's said that Peter ter Kulve, Unilever's head of ice cream, said he was concerned about the 'continued perception of antisemitism' regarding the ice cream brand voicing its opinions on Gazan refugees, according to the lawsuit. Unilever was also required under the settlement agreement to make a total of $5 million in payments to Ben & Jerry's for the brand to make donations to human rights groups of its choosing, according to the lawsuit. Ben & Jerry's selected the left-leaning Jewish Voice for Peace and the San Francisco Bay Area Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, among others, the filing says. Unilever in August objected to the selections, saying that Jewish Voice for Peace was 'too critical of the Israeli government,' according to the lawsuit. Ben & Jerry's has positioned itself as socially conscious since Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield founded the company in a renovated gas station in 1978. It kept that mission after Unilever acquired it in 2000. Unilever's dozens of products include Dove soap, Hellmann's mayonnaise, Knorr bouillon cubes, Surf detergent and Vaseline petroleum jelly.

US submits Israel-Lebanon cease-fire draft as pressure on Hezboll...	US official stresses ‘deal in Lebanon more likely than hostage agreement’; Israeli officials expect Lebanon’s response within the coming days The United States on Thursday delivered a draft cease-fire proposal to Lebanon, developed in coordination with Israel, with officials in Jerusalem and Washington now awaiting Lebanon’s response. An Israeli official estimated a reply within days, while White House Special Envoy Amos Hochstein told Lebanese leaders he would not travel to Beirut unless assured Lebanon was ready to finalize an agreement. Hochstein submitted the draft to Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who is negotiating on behalf of Hezbollah. Meanwhile, the IDF has increased military pressure in Lebanon, operating in the second line of villages to further diminish Hezbollah’s capabilities, while continuing airstrikes in Syria and Beirut's Dahieh district. In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a high-level security meeting Thursday with Defense Minister Israel Katz and other key ministers, including Bezalel Smotrich, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Ron Dermer, discussing both the Lebanon cease-fire talks and ongoing operations in Gaza. A U.S. official familiar with the discussions said, 'A deal in Lebanon is more likely than a hostage agreement.' IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that Israel's objective is 'to clear Hezbollah’s terror infrastructure in southern Lebanon and ensure it cannot pose a threat to Israeli civilians.' Hagari emphasized that the IDF’s role is to create the conditions needed for the political leadership to reach a diplomatic solution. Defense Minister Katz reiterated Israel's goal of disarming Hezbollah, though other officials have avoided direct mention of this aim. Israeli officials are reportedly pushing for an agreement before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration. The potential agreement may include U.S.-led efforts to arm Lebanon's army, which would be tasked with addressing violations and dismantling Hezbollah’s infrastructure up to the Litani River. Meanwhile, rocket fire from Lebanon toward northern Israel has persisted in recent days, sometimes reaching central Israel and the Sharon region, but the IDF reported Thursday that daily rocket averages have dropped to below 100, down from over 150. The IDF attributed the decrease to intensified military pressure on Hezbollah’s launch capabilities, including targeted strikes on rocket launchers and firepower resources. On Monday’s 'Martyr’s Day,' Hezbollah claimed responsibility for 200 launches, while by 6 p.m. Thursday, it had taken responsibility for 18 separate attacks. The IDF said that since ground operations began, over 2,250 Hezbollah fighters, including several high-ranking commanders, have been killed, impacting the group’s ability to launch attacks. Israeli forces have faced heavy losses since the start of the ground incursion into Lebanon, with 67 killed, including 16 civilians and 51 soldiers—41 of whom died in Lebanese territory.

Some 88 Democratic lawmakers urged U.S. President Joe Biden to sanction members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government over anti-Palestinian violence in the West Bank, according to a letter released on Thursday. Urging Biden to send a message to U.S. partners before he leaves office, the members of Congress said Israeli cabinet members Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir had incited violence by Israeli settlers. 'We write to express our deep concern about the rise in settler violence, settlement expansion, and measures adopted to weaken the Palestinian Authority and otherwise destabilize the West Bank,' they said in the letter. The letter, was signed by 17 senators and 71 House members. The letter was dated Oct. 29 but made public on Thursday because the lawmakers had not had a response from the White House.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1c0000c7fjx	2024-11-14T11:11:39-08:00

Military says Hezbollah rocket fire down to under 100 daily launches, emphasizing its goal to push terror group as far back as possible; cautious cease-fire talks continue as World Bank estimates Lebanon's war damages at $8 billion, with 100,000 homes damaged Rocket fire from Lebanon toward northern Israel has persisted in recent days, sometimes reaching central Israel and the Sharon region, but the IDF reported Thursday that daily rocket averages have dropped to below 100, down from over 150. The IDF attributed the decrease to intensified military pressure on Hezbollah’s launch capabilities, including targeted strikes on rocket launchers and firepower resources. On Monday’s 'Martyr’s Day,' Hezbollah claimed responsibility for 200 launches, while by 6 p.m. Thursday, it had taken responsibility for 18 separate attacks. The IDF said that since ground operations began, over 2,250 Hezbollah fighters, including several high-ranking commanders, have been killed, impacting the group’s ability to launch attacks. Israeli forces have faced heavy losses since the start of the ground incursion into Lebanon, with 67 killed, including 16 civilians and 51 soldiers—41 of whom died in Lebanese territory. 'We had five encounters with Hezbollah fighters since yesterday,' the IDF reported on Thursday. 'We are coordinating military moves with diplomatic efforts, which is crucial.' The IDF highlighted the complexity of combat in built-up areas and emphasized ongoing lessons learned to reduce casualties. Most current ground activity is within five to six kilometers of the Lebanese border, in western and eastern sectors of southern Lebanon. 'Hezbollah incursions into northern Israel could persist for years,' IDF officials warned. The military clarified that ground forces are targeting underground complexes housing advanced weaponry, where airstrikes alone may achieve only partial success. 'We may not eliminate every threat, but we’re advancing well,' the IDF added. Energy Minister Eli Cohen, in an interview with Reuters, said that Israel is closer than ever to reaching an agreement to end fighting in Lebanon and push Hezbollah away from the border, while insisting that Israel maintains the right to act military should it be violated. A key sticking point for Israel, he said, is ensuring it retains freedom of action should Hezbollah return to border areas. 'We will be less forgiving than in the past over attempts to create strongholds in territory near Israel. That's how we will be, and so that is certainly how we will act.' In terms of a mechanism to enforce the agreement, Cohen said: 'There are discussions, but it has not been agreed upon.' An Israeli official familiar with ongoing cease-fire negotiations said Thursday that progress is being made, but cautioned that a resolution remains uncertain. 'We’re closer than we were yesterday, but not near enough to say it will end very soon,' the official noted, adding that military assessments remain a factor, with decisions hinging on whether to 'end hostilities now' or after clearing Hezbollah strongholds in southern Lebanon. He further said that officials aim to finalize the agreement before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump assumes office in January. Meanwhile, the World Bank reported Thursday that Lebanon’s war damages from the year-long conflict now exceed $8 billion, with almost 100,000 homes damaged or destroyed. According to the report, covering the period from October 2023—when Hezbollah joined Hamas in attacks on Israel—through October 2024, at least 99,209 residential units were impacted, primarily in southern Lebanese regions like Tyre, Nabatieh, Sidon, Bint Jbeil and Marjayoun. The World Bank’s analysis placed losses from damages to sectors like tourism and agriculture at $5.1 billion and destruction to infrastructure at an additional $3.4 billion. The final economic toll is expected to be significantly higher, compounding Lebanon's ongoing economic crisis, which has pushed most of its population below the poverty line since 2019. Lebanon also faces a growing displacement crisis, with approximately 1.6 million residents forced from homes situated in Hezbollah-occupied areas in southern Lebanon due to IDF operations.

US hands Lebanon draft truce proposal, two sources say	The U.S. ambassador to Lebanon submitted a draft truce proposal to Lebanon's speaker of parliament Nabih Berri on Thursday to halt fighting between terrorist group Hezbollah and Israel, two political sources told Reuters, without revealing details. The U.S. has sought to broker a cease-fire that would end hostilities between its ally Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah, but efforts have yet to yield a result. Israel launched a stepped-up air and ground campaign in late September after cross-border clashes in parallel with the Gaza war. U.S. ambassador Lisa Johnson met with Berri, a Hezbollah ally and the typical conduit for diplomacy with the group, on Thursday to submit Washington's first written proposal in at least several weeks, two senior Lebanese political sources said. 'It is a draft to get observations from the Lebanese side,' one of the sources told Reuters. Neither source could provide details on the contents of the proposal.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1chcp7fke	2024-11-14T10:24:44-08:00	
Coup in every sense of the word': Coalition leaders reject calls...	Lawmakers reject any move to declare PM temporarily unfit during trial testimony, calling move legally unfounded; 'Only the people, through their elected representatives in Knesset, can decide who will lead them and serve as prime minister' Leaders of the coalition parties issued an unusual statement Thursday night, firmly rejecting any notion that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be temporarily declared unfit whenever he testifies in his ongoing corruption trial. 'We categorically reject any attempt to declare the prime minister unfit, even for a very short period,' the statement read. 'Any such declaration lacks legal foundation and is therefore invalid.' They warned that a temporary declaration of unfitness would be akin to a 'coup in every sense of the word' and argued that Netanyahu must continue leading Israel's security and diplomatic efforts, which they deem a matter of national interest. 'We stand and will continue to stand guard over democracy. Only the people, through their elected representatives in the Knesset, can decide who will lead them and serve as prime minister.' The statement was signed by Justice Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Yariv Levin, representing Netanyahu's Likud Party, along with the heads of all other coalition parties, including newly appointed Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar. The decision to issue the statement followed a ruling by Jerusalem District Court judges that Netanyahu’s testimony will proceed as scheduled on December 2, despite the ongoing war. Netanyahu faces three graft cases, commonly referred to as Case 1000, Case 2000 and Case 4000, involving charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. In Case 1000, he is accused of receiving lavish gifts from a billionaire friend in exchange for favors; Case 2000 alleges negotiations with a newspaper publisher for favorable coverage; and Case 4000, the most serious, involves claims he granted regulatory benefits to a telecom giant in exchange for positive media coverage from its news outlet. Why is such an option even considered? Ironically, Netanyahu's own claims about the impact of wartime responsibilities on his trial testimony have intensified the possibility of a temporary incapacitation declaration, legal experts say. In a recent request to postpone his testimony, Netanyahu argued that the ongoing war prevents him from fully preparing with his defense attorney and makes it impossible for him to disconnect and testify for seven hours across multiple days. In a hearing on Wednesday, Netanyahu’s lawyer, Amit Hadad, said, 'A country cannot be governed in wartime while its prime minister is on the witness stand.' However, in 2020, Netanyahu argued before the High Court of Justice that he could manage both state affairs and a trial. While that stance applied in peacetime, he now acknowledges that managing both during wartime is not feasible. If Netanyahu maintains this position, Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara could issue a letter mandating that, while testifying, he temporarily transfer his powers to another minister, as would be done if he were undergoing medical treatment. Netanyahu would resume his duties at the end of each court day. Should he resist, petitions may be submitted to the High Court, demanding he step aside temporarily during his testimony. Netanyahu faces a challenging legal position, given his own admission that wartime duties and testimony are incompatible. Earlier this year, the High Court ruled that a new amendment regarding incapacitation would apply only from the next Knesset. However, Netanyahu’s acknowledgment that war-time testimony creates an incapacity could complicate his case. His attorney may argue that declaring a prime minister incapacitated during war—even temporarily—would be unreasonable and against public interest, suggesting instead that another witness take the stand in his place. The High Court, however, may find it difficult to accept this procedural claim, as the district court has already determined that Netanyahu must testify and the High Court is not an appeals court for district court rulings.

Drone from Lebanon enters Israeli airspace, leading to 40-minute pursuit before crashing near Eliakim, where 2 soldiers moderately hurt; incursion triggers widespread alert sirens and prompts aerial monitoring along Israel’s northern coast A drone infiltrating Israeli airspace from Lebanon struck near Eliakim in the Megiddo region on Thursday, wounding two Israeli soldiers moderately, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari reported Thursday evening. The drone’s incursion prompted a 40-minute chase and triggered alert sirens in towns across northern Israel, from Nahariya near the Lebanese border and Acre to the Haifa Bay area and down to Zichron Ya'akov. The incident began with sirens sounding in multiple cities, initially in towns close to the Lebanese border and moving southward as the drone progressed along Israel’s coastline. Low-flying helicopters and increased aerial activity were reported by residents in affected areas, including Yokneam, Kiryat Tivon, Or Akiva and parts of the Megiddo Regional Council. The IDF confirmed that the UAV had entered Israel from Lebanon and was closely monitored as it traveled south. The incident concluded near Eliakim, where the drone ultimately crashed. Authorities issued precautionary warnings to residents across the region, underscoring ongoing security concerns.

Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of war crimes over Gaza displac...	Israeli authorities have caused a forced displacement of Palestinian people in Gaza to an extent that constitutes war crimes and crimes against humanity, Human Rights Watch said in a report on Thursday. Israel, in response, accused the organization of using rhetoric that is 'completely false and detached from reality.' The report said that 'Human Rights Watch found that forced displacement has been widespread, and the evidence shows it has been systematic and part of a state policy. Such acts also constitute crimes against humanity.' The law of armed conflict forbids the forcible displacement of civilian populations from occupied territory, unless necessary for the security of civilians or imperative military reasons. For the past month, Israeli troops have moved tens of thousands of people from areas in the north of the enclave as they have sought to destroy Hamas forces the military says have been regrouping around the towns of Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun. Human Rights Watch said the displacement of Palestinians 'is likely planned to be permanent in the buffer zones and security corridors', an action it said would amount to 'ethnic cleansing'.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkqumtqfye	2024-11-14T09:35:39-08:00	
Dutch police arrest 281 at anti-Israel riot in Amsterdam	Pro-Palestinian protesters violate ban on demonstrating; videos circulated online depict police violence, including beating protesters with batons after release from detention Dutch authorities on Thursday said they were investigating reports of police violence against pro-Palestinian protesters after a banned rally on Wednesday evening had been broken up. The Amsterdam police said on X that they were aware of online footage, which seemed to show police officers beating protesters who had already been released after being taken away from the site of the protest. A total of 281 protesters were detained as they participated in an anti-Israel demonstration in central Amsterdam on Wednesday in defiance of a ban imposed after violence stemming from a soccer match between Ajax and Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv last week. 'Images of police acting with force are always disturbing to see and will be weighed and judged. Also in this case,' Amsterdam police said in a post on X. Police with expanded stop-and-search powers in the Dutch capital have detained or removed hundreds of demonstrators since last week's clashes, under emergency measures imposed until Thursday. Four out of 62 suspects detained during the violence, which included 10 Israelis, remain in custody. Police are still looking for suspects. Due to the violence against the Israelis, the Amsterdam police announced a ban on demonstrations, but in recent days pro-Palestinian demonstrators have violated the ban several times. Masked rioters in Amsterdam threw fireworks at a tram in the west of the city Monday evening while shouting 'Jews are cancer.' The tram car, which was empty, caught fire and its windows were blown out. In addition, damage was caused to nearby vehicles. In the city square, where rioters threw fireworks and waved sticks, clashes broke out between dozens of young people - who were dressed in black and wore masks - and police forces. A few rioters were arrested; there were no casualties.

IDF: Rocket fire from Lebanon drops as pressure mounts on Hezboll...	The IDF reported on Thursday that daily rocket fire from Lebanon has decreased to fewer than 100 rockets, down from over 150, following intensified barrages targeting Israel’s north and central regions in recent days. The IDF attributes this drop to increased military pressure on Hezbollah’s launch capabilities, including strikes on rocket launch sites and firepower infrastructure. The IDF also said that over 2,250 Hezbollah operatives have been killed since the onset of Israel’s ground operations, including numerous senior commanders, which has reportedly hindered Hezbollah’s ability to sustain retaliatory actions. 'We are reinforcing this success, targeting additional launchers each day aimed at strikes on northern Israel,' the IDF said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjt2ss7zyx	2024-11-14T07:32:02-08:00	
UN to bolster UNIFIL mission for post-truce support in Lebanon	The United Nations intends to bolster its peacekeeping mission in Lebanon to better support the Lebanese army once a truce is agreed but would not directly enforce a cease-fire, U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix said on Thursday. The peacekeeping mission known as UNIFIL is deployed in southern Lebanon to monitor the demarcation line with Israel, an area that has seen more than a year of hostilities between Israeli troops and Iran-backed Hezbollah terrorists. Israel has for years accused UNIFIL of failing to implement U.N. resolution 1701, which ended the Second Lebanon war in 2006 and requires Hezbollah to remove fighters and weapons from areas between the border and the Litani River, and now says peacekeepers must get out of the way as Israeli troops fight Hezbollah. UNIFIL troops have refused to leave their posts, despite repeated Israeli attacks that have wounded peacekeepers.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk00dmjqzyx	2024-11-14T07:22:49-08:00

With full congressional backing secured, Trump plans Pentagon 'pu...	After Republicans take control of both houses of Congress, plans to 'clean house' at Pentagon and bring in more like-minded people to Trump's new administration already in motion Republicans clinched a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, completing a sweep of both chambers of Congress and solidifying GOP power alongside President-elect Donald Trump. Following the final vote count, which gave Republicans at least 218 of the 435 House seats, the party also secured a Senate majority, positioning Trump to govern decisively. With Trump set for inauguration on January 20, his transition team is actively assembling his administration, including key nominations like the new ambassador to Israel. Notably, the transition team is reportedly preparing a plan to overhaul military leadership, potentially targeting officers perceived as having resisted Trump’s policies in the past. According to Reuters, the team is compiling a list of senior officers, including some members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for possible removal. This includes officers seen as aligned with former Chairman Mark Milley, whom Trump allies have criticized over perceived 'disloyalty' following Milley’s recent comments against Trump. The transition team’s list reportedly targets 'woke' officers, referencing Trump’s criticism of leaders he claimed were promoted based on diversity initiatives rather than combat-readiness. While some insiders express doubts over the feasibility of these changes, pointing to the risks posed amid current global conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, others close to Trump insist such moves are necessary to reshape the military's leadership. The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that Trump’s team is even preparing an executive order to establish a committee that would identify high-ranking officials for demotion. If enacted, this would mark an unprecedented reshaping of the military leadership under the president's role as commander-in-chief. Meanwhile, Trump has named Pete Hegseth, a Fox News commentator and former Army officer, as his choice for secretary of fefense. Hegseth, known for his calls to 'clean house' at the Pentagon, has argued in recent writings that reshaping the senior ranks is crucial to ensuring U.S. defense readiness.

Iranian-backed militias in Iraq launch daily drone attacks on Isr...	Although Iraq is aware that militia activity from its territory poses a threat, fearing an Israeli retaliatory strike, pro-Iranian militia Islamic Resistance in Iraq continues to launch drone attacks and, reportedly, joint operations with Yemen's Houthis In recent weeks, the 'Islamic Resistance in Iraq' has launched nightly attacks on Israel. According to Arab reports, this organization comprises six pro-Iranian militias, including Iraq's Hezbollah Brigades, al-Nujaba, and Sayyid al-Shuhada. Operating out of Iraq and Syria, these militias target both Israel and international coalition bases led by the United States. On Wednesday, the 'Islamic Resistance in Iraq' claimed to have launched drones toward targets in northern Israel.' The group reported two strikes, following four drone attacks it had claimed the previous day, targeting what it called 'vital locations' in Eilat, central Israel, and two areas in the north. Some announcements included videos of the launches. On Tuesday, the group claimed responsibility for three attacks, and a day earlier, for six. This surge in attacks reflects an uptick in the group’s weekly drone launches at Israel. Reports of Israeli interceptions of drones over Syrian airspace en route to Israel are believed to involve these militias' drones. Occasionally, drones from the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen also attempt to reach Israel from the east, but the bulk of attacks come from the pro-Iranian militias. The Houthis have even reported joint operations with the militias during the ongoing war. On Wednesday, Sky News Arabia cited Iranian sources saying that Tehran had postponed the operation of a planned third attack on Israel. According to these sources, Iran’s response has been delayed until potential upcoming talks with former President Donald Trump, following a warning message delivered through Iraq. Meanwhile, Tehran continues to threaten. Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Commander Hossein Salami, speaking at the opening of a military drill honoring former Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, issued a warning to Israel. 'We are watching you closely,' Salami said. 'We will fight to the end and will not allow you to control the fate of Muslims. We will take revenge on the Zionist entity; it will suffer painful blows.' IRGC Deputy Commander Ali Fadavi added, 'We have not agreed, and will never agree, to any aggression against us. We will respond to Israel with force.' Though not in the form of heavy missile barrages or large drone swarms, Iran's attacks on Israel continue each night through its proxies in Syria and Iraq. A question that has preoccupied Israeli officials recently – whether Iran would strike directly or via Iraq – is becoming less relevant as drones are now launched almost daily from the region toward Israel. Iraq is aware that militia activity from its territory poses a threat to itself, fearing an Israeli retaliatory strike. Iraqi leaders also understand that, geographically, Iraq's airspace is a likely flashpoint in any Iran-Israel war. Iraq’s National Security Advisor Qasim al-Araji visited Tehran earlier this week, meeting with senior officials, including Quds Force Commander Esmail Qaani, who recently resumed public appearances. According to a Monday report from Sky News Arabia, al-Araji conveyed a U.S. message to Iran, warning that any response against Israel could lead the region into an open conflict with severe repercussions. On Tuesday, Qatar’s Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported that al-Araji had told Tehran that Iraq is committed to staying out of Iran’s wars with Israel and the U.S. Al-Araji reportedly asked Tehran to respect agreements between Washington and Baghdad and refrain from targeting U.S. forces in Iraq. He also requested that Iran pressure its allied militias to keep Iraq out of the war. However, these talks did not prevent recent launches toward Israel or attacks on U.S. bases in Syria. Iran has maintained that these militias act independently, motivated by a commitment to support Gaza. This week, the Qatari newspaper explained why pro-Iranian militias have shifted to nighttime operations. Citing Iraqi security sources, the report noted a recent increase in U.S. drone activity over the Iraq-Syria border, monitoring for weapons or fighters moving from Baghdad to Damascus. A senior official described this as a 'U.S. prohibition on all activities supporting Hezbollah or targeting Israeli assets.' American drones aim to identify launch sites used by the militias to strike Israeli bases, while nighttime operations help the groups evade detection.

Israel strikes Damascus during Iranian official's visit	Opposition site says IDF targeted an apartment in the Al Masseh quarter of the capital killing at least three people and wounding at least nine others; official Syrian news agency says two building hit in strike Israel attacked a suburb of Damascus on Thursday, the official news agency Sanaa reported, saying the attack was on the Al Mazzeh quarter in the west of the capital adding that there were casualties in the strike on two buildings. The strike took place during a visit of a senior advisor to Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei who is, according to Lebanese media reports, visiting the area on 'a special mission.' According to the Syrian opposition outlet Voice of the Capital, the attack targeted an apartment in the area and ambulances were seen rushing to the scene. The UK based Observatory for Human Rights, another Syrian opposition group, said that at least three people were killed and at least nine were hurt in the attack. News of the attack came shortly after Israel struck Hezbollah targets near Beirut's international airport, while a plane was on the runway preparing for takeoff. Israel said it attacked more than 30 terror targets in Beirut in the past two days including weapons stores and production sites the military said were near or beneath civilian structures and population. 'These strikes were a part of the IDF's ongoing efforts to dismantle and degrade Hezbollah's military capabilities, and the IDF is continuing to strike Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure sites in the Dahieh area,' the military said in a statement.

key principles for ceasefire set by Hezbollah, Beirut leaders, re...	Mikati government presents terms including complete Israeli withdrawal, ban on IDF activity in Lebanese territory on the ground, in the air and in sea; rejects any change to 1701 Lebanese officials, including Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Najib Mikati, and Hezbollah’s leadership, have established a framework outlining five key principles for ceasefire negotiations, according to a report in the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Akhbar newspaper on Thursday. Hezbollah. First and foremost, Lebanon prioritizes its own interests over those of Israel and will not negotiate with the United States as long as it speaks on Israel's behalf, Al Akhabar wrote. According to the report, Lebanon demands a complete and immediate ceasefire, rejecting any notion of temporary pauses or intermittent ceasefires. It insists on a comprehensive cessation of all military actions and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Lebanese territory. Lebanon rejects any phased implementation agreement; instead, it calls for the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 without any modifications to its enforcement mechanism, along with guarantees that Israel will cease all violations. Lebanon also dismisses any effort to link the return of displaced individuals to their villages with any other arrangements. The displaced will return just hours after a ceasefire is achieved and once Israel has completed its withdrawal. Lebanon maintains that no external entity has authority over its reconstruction efforts. Finally, the paper wrote, Lebanon will not tolerate Israeli aircraft entering its airspace or Israeli boats entering its territorial waters, and it refuses to grant any security or military oversight to the U.S. or Israel. A temporary committee, including representatives from relevant UN forces, would be the sole body authorized to oversee each party’s adherence to Resolution 1701. The Lebanese position as reported by Al Akhbar come as Israeli and American officials have indicated progress in the talks to achieve an end to the fighting in Lebanon and an agreement that would remove Hezbollah for South Lebanon. Israel was seeking American assurances in a 'side document' that would specify Israel's freedom of operation if Lebanon violates any agreements. 'This is Israel's top priority,' an official said. 'We have clear understandings with the Americans. In the event of weapons transfers from Syria, Hezbollah rearmament, or attempted attacks, we will have support to act.' The emerging arrangement is expected to include Hezbollah's withdrawal north of the Litani River, deployment of the Lebanese Army and an international peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, and the prevention of weapons transfers from Syria.

Iran tells IAEA chief it will negotiate, but not under pressure	Iran's nuclear chief warns that Tehran would react immediately to any resolution against it at an IAEA meeting next week, without elaborating Iran is willing to end an impasse over a range of issues with the U.N. nuclear agency on its atomic program but it will not succumb to pressure, its foreign minister said after meeting the watchdog's chief in Tehran on Thursday. Diplomats told Reuters on Wednesday that European powers (E3) are pushing for a new resolution against Iran by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board next week to pressure Tehran over what they view as its poor cooperation. The talks took place with Donald Trump due to take office again as U.S. President in January. During his previous tenure, the United States pulled out of the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and six world powers aimed at curbing Tehran's sensitive nuclear work. It is unclear whether Trump will continue his 'maximum pressure' policy on Iran when he takes office. Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi posted on X: 'The ball is in the EU/E3 court. Willing to negotiate based on our national interest and inalienable rights, but not ready to negotiate under pressure and intimidation,' following his talks with the IAEA chief. Iranian state media also quoted him as saying: 'I hope the other side will adopt a rational policy.' Relations between Tehran and the IAEA have soured over several long-standing issues including Iran barring the agency's uranium-enrichment experts from the country and its failure to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites. In August, the agency said Iran's production of highly enriched uranium continues and it has not improved cooperation with it despite a resolution passed by the IAEA Board of Governors in June. Grossi, who has long sought progress with Tehran over its fast-advancing nuclear work, said: 'Inspections are just one chapter of our cooperation and cannot be discussed.' The U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear pact in 2018 and the reimposition of sanctions prompted Tehran to violate limitations on its uranium enrichment - seen by the West as a disguised effort to develop nuclear weapons capability. Tehran is now enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to the roughly 90% required for an atom bomb. Tehran says its nuclear work is purely for peaceful purposes. Iran's nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami said his meeting with Grossi was 'constructive' but he warned that Tehran would react immediately to any resolution against it at an IAEA meeting next week, without elaborating. A senior Iranian official told Reuters on Wednesday that Tehran's reaction to a resolution could be to limit diplomatic and technical cooperation with the IAEA. Grossi, in a televised joint press conference with Eslami, urged Tehran to take steps to resolve the remaining issues. 'It is in our power here to take concrete steps that will indicate clearly, to the U.S. and the international community, that we can clarify things and move forward with concrete solutions,' Grossi said. Grossi, who arrived in Tehran on Wednesday, is expected to meet Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian for the first time since he took office in August. On Tuesday, Pezeshkian, seen as relatively moderate, said Tehran will not be able to ignore its arch-foe the United States and needs to 'handle its enemies with forbearance'.

Netanyahu chief of staff probed in security related scandal	Tzachi Braverman, the prime minister's closest aid is summoned by the police serious crimes unit for questioning under caution over matters involving possible misconduct at the PMO Tzachi Braverman, Chief of Staff to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was summoned to the police special crimes unit on Thursday for questioning under caution. He is suspected of involvement in security-related cases tied to the Prime Minister's Office. The police was investigating whether he held embarrassing information about a senior IDF officer for the purpose of using it prevent disclosure of misconduct in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO.) Braverman also faces suspicion in the 'Protocols Affair,' which according to allegations, involved efforts to alter minutes from official and confidential meeting at the start of the war regarding the Hamas massacre. Braverman, 65 is a powerful figure in the PMO and among the closest aids to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'He is cold-blooded to a psychotic degree,' an unnamed government minister said last week. 'He has a cowardly nature. He’s cautious not to get entangled and act against procedures, but he can always pin it on someone else.' Netanyahu in an unprecedented statement, criticized the police and the Shin Bet earlier in the week for what he called an attempt to bring down a right-wing government. 'In recent days, my office has been under wild and unrestrained attack,' Netanyahu said on camera after repeated denials from his office of any wrong-doings in any of the matters under investigation. 'While the government and cabinet under my leadership tirelessly work to repel our enemies who seek our destruction and strive to defeat them, as I manage the war and fend off international attacks from various arenas, we now face another front with increased intensity—the fake news from the media.' Netanyahu said that since the beginning of the war, a flood of criminal and severe leaks has inundated Israel, referring to reports in the press about his management of the hostage crisis and his refusal to agree to a deal with Hamas that would secure their release. 'These criminal leaks are sometimes accompanied by baseless lies and slanders. A deluge of leaks from the political-security cabinet, the war cabinet at the time, and a continuous tsunami of leaks from the negotiation team. These leaks provide vital information to Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas, endangering the state, our fighters, and the return of our captives,' he said. 'Hamas receives information from inside Israel's negotiation team meeting room. Hezbollah and Iran sometimes get live transcripts of our discussions on actions against them and our internal debates.' He said claiming there has been selective enforcement of security offenses by law enforcement and judicial authorities. 'Regarding all these, zero investigations were conducted. Zero. This happened despite my repeated requests to open investigations. They don’t even check, why? Because the goal is not to protect the state's security. The goal is to promote an agenda of weakness and concessions during the war.'

Eritrea pays to free its supporters from Israel's jails after rio...	After 135 people hurt in violence between waring Eritrean groups Israel late to take steps to deport those responsible The government in Eritrea posted NIS 84,000 in bail to release its supporters from prison after they were involved in violent riots, vandalism and theft, according to a document obtained by Ynet on Thursday. The violence erupted earlier this year when asylum-seekers who were opponents of the regime and its supporters clashed on the streets of Tel Aviv. More than nine people were killed and over 100 hurt in mass riots in August and September. Then Tel Aviv police chief Peretz Amar said his force cannot single-handedly respond to the violence. His statement came after two people were brutally murdered. In a rare, accusatory speech, Amar blamed the government for failing to address the problem by deporting the instigators. Eritrea is considered by some in the West as an oppressive and brutal regime, posing a genuine threat to the lives of its dissents. Consequently, although Eritreans in Israel are not officially recognized as refugees, they are not repatriated under a policy practiced in many countries, which aims to protect individuals from severe rights violations or life-threatening conditions in their homeland. Instead of refugee status, they receive temporary permits allowing them to remain in Israel without permanent residency rights. However, in the case of clear regime supporters, it is unclear why Israel has not deported them, especially considering their violent attacks on asylum seekers who face genuine life threats. The document was written by a judge last September after the Eritrean embassy's requested to be refunded for a bond posted for the release of a supporter of the regime. The Population and Immigration Authority refused having been surprised to learn who paid the bail. The judge ruled that the request should not be considered until the Eritrean is deported and asked why he was allowed to remains in Israel at all. He was arrested over his involvement in riots last September near the Eritrean embassy in Tel Aviv, during which he assaulted other foreigners with clubs and engaged in extensive vandalism. He and others were initially released because the investigation could not be completed and evidence could not be gathered to prove criminality. 'The Eritrean embassy should assist the detainee in returning to his country, as he was personally aided by them during his detention and was involved in violent events on the side of the regime supporters in Eritrea,' the judge wrote, 'It became clear during the hearing and discussion with him that there is actually no obstacle to his return to his country, and the reason for his stay in Israel was not clarified. After the detainee leaves Israel in accordance with the deportation order, the embassy may request a refund of the bond deposited to ensure his departure from Israel.' The document reveals that Eritrea has been posting bail for the release of violent citizens detained in Israel since 2018. This practice continued even after the unprecedented riots on September 2, 2023, which injured at least 135 people and turned South Tel Aviv into a battleground. As of December 31, 2023, there were 17,381 Eritreans in Israel, out of 23,081 asylum seekers. A trend of departure is evident, with 2,557 leaving in 2023, compared to 2,205 in 2022 and 1,340 in 2021. It's unclear why Israeli authorities accepted bail money from Eritrea, allowing rioters to remain under the guise of seeking asylum, despite their support for the Eritrean regime. The Ministry of Justice is aware of these releases and is currently discussing the possibility of deporting Eritreans who commit criminal offenses and support the regime. This discussion involves representatives from the Population and Immigration Authority, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Israeli Police, and the Ministry of National Security, though no decision has been made yet. The Justice Ministry said deportation is under the authority of the Population and Immigration Authority and that anyone in Israel committing offenses is subject to Israeli law, with no separate legal standards for foreigners. The Immigration Ministry said that foreigners violating the law risk having their permits revoked and being deported, except in cases where criminal proceedings are ongoing. However, this excludes those who cannot be returned to their home country, where only criminal proceedings are applicable. Eritreans in Israel are protected under a non-deportation policy, which is reviewed periodically. The National Security Ministry's position is to deport all infiltrators back to their countries. The ministry said it faced challenges in deporting infiltrators due to Supreme Court rulings limiting the state's ability to deport them. Despite this, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir criticized the Justice Ministry and the Attorney General for delaying deportations.

Author Amotz Asa-El: ‘Nobody can silence Hezbollah’s guns’	ILTV News Insider experts say only Iran can stop Hezbollah from firing on Israel Can a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah be reached before President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January? According to author and Middle East analyst Amotz Asa-El, the outlook is grim. 'I’m pessimistic not because of the Lebanese government’s attitude, not because of America, not because of Israel, but because of Hezbollah,' he told ILTV’s Insider this week. 'Nobody down there is in a position to actually make it silence its guns. We consigned with the United States whatever they and us would like to do, none of that will impact the militia over there directly.' Who can silence Hezbollah? According to Asa-El, only Iran, and 'no one knows how to make them do that.'

Can the IDF decimate Hezbollah’s weapons arsenal?	ILTV News speaks with Joe Truzman, a senior research analyst and editor at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies If the IDF aimed to eliminate all of Hezbollah’s precision-guided missiles and other weapons, the war between Israel and the terrorist organization would likely take much longer, according to Joe Truzman, a senior research analyst and editor at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies' Long War Journal. 'Right now, the Israeli government's goal, essentially, is a limited conflict,' he told ILTV News, 'specifically to remove Hezbollah from southern Lebanon up to the Litani River, so the Israeli civilians that have been displaced during the war can return home.'

‘Mike Huckabee wants to be settler himself’	ILTV News speaks with Rabbi Tuly Weisz of Israel365 By nominating former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as U.S. Ambassador to Israel, President-elect Donald Trump is effectively signaling he does not consider a two-state solution to be viable for resolving the Middle East conflict, according to Rabbi Tuly Weisz, founder of Israel365. 'Mike Huckabee is the biggest proponent of Judea and Samaria,' Weisz told ILTV on Wednesday. 'He doesn't even call it the West Bank. He only refers to it by its historical and biblical name: Yehuda and Shomron, Judea and Samaria. The Biden administration is sanctioning settlers, and Mike Huckabee wants to buy a house in Efrat and become a settler himself.' Weisz argued that with many of Trump’s new appointments, Israel could see vast changes in U.S. policy 'from night to day, from bad to good.' 'We’re going to see great things, especially when it comes to handling the war,' said Weisz. 'Israel has been fighting with its hands tied behind its back,' with the U.S. 'holding back weapons, leading to the deaths of IDF soldiers.' He said Trump, on the other hand, would support Israel in finishing the war victoriously, including the release of hostages. Huckabee, however, is the first evangelical Christian, as opposed to Jewish, appointment as ambassador to Israel in some time. Weisz believes this will benefit Israel, as Jewish ambassadors to Israel are 'very nervous about allegations of dual loyalty.' In contrast, he said, 'Christians don't have that problem. They have one loyalty. They have loyalty to God, and the Word of God, and the Word of God is really crystal clear that America needs to support Israel.'

Israel plans Lebanon cease-fire as gift for Trump	Minister Ron Dermer holds talks in D.C. aiming for agreement in time Trump for Trump's second term; Key points include Hezbollah’s withdrawal, Lebanese army deployment and Russia's pressure on al-Assad to prevent Syrian arms smuggling Israel is maneuvering toward a ceasefire agreement with Lebanon, an initiative poised to gift the incoming President Donald Trump with a diplomatic triumph as he takes office. According to reports in the Washington Post on Thursday. Prime Minister Netanyahu had already set the stage for this 'new era' with Washington well before the American presidential elections, maintaining contact with Trump while Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer discussed the matter with Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, an architect of the Abraham Accords. A former Trump administration official told the paper that Kushner may assume an advisory role should normalization talks between Israel and Saudi Arabia advance, even if he holds no official position in the White House. Dermer's talks at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Florida estate, reportedly focused on a ceasefire agreement in Lebanon involving Russian participation. Russian representatives visited Israel last month to deliberate on the plan, and Dermer followed up with a visit to Russia. From Hezbollah's perspective, a source close to the terror group indicated potential agreement to withdraw its forces north of the Litani River as part of a provisional ceasefire. According to Israeli sources, the Lebanese army would control the border area during the first 60 days of the agreement, supervised by the U.S. and the U.K. However, Hezbollah resists Israel's stipulation, intended to be a 'side document' to the agreement, asserting a clear condition: Israel must refrain from operations within Lebanese territory. An Israeli official said that negotiations with the U.S. were nearing agreement. Central to these talks was a 'side document,' deemed critical, to be provided by the U.S., that would specify Israel's operational freedom in response to any Lebanese violations. Israel and the U.S. have reached explicit understandings, granting Israel the backing to act in the event of weapons transfers from Syria, Hezbollah rearmament, or attempted attacks. The importance of U.S. agreement is underscored by existing tensions between the nations, with legitimacy and the ability to act being paramount for Israel. The core elements of the emerging arrangement include Hezbollah's withdrawal north of the Litani River, Lebanese army deployment in southern Lebanon, and preventing weapon transfers from Syria. Concurrently, Israeli representatives, including Dermer, have visited Moscow to enlist Russian pressure on Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime. Israel is already targeting military sites within Syria, reflecting an assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin has vested interests in safeguarding Assad's regime from potential destabilization due to continued arms transfers. Despite these efforts, significant doubts linger regarding Lebanon's willingness to accept the arrangement. As one Israeli official noted, understandings with the Americans can be achieved, but ultimately, the Lebanese may reject them. Should this occur, Israel is prepared with alternative operational plans, vowing not to tolerate a prolonged state of attrition warfare and pledging intensified action in Lebanon until an agreement is reached. An agreement could be reached in the coming weeks. If successful, it would be presented for approval by Israel's political-security cabinet, though it remains undecided whether Knesset approval wouldalso be necessary. Amos Hochstein, the U.S. special envoy to Lebanon, expressed optimism about a deal being reached but said that there was no Russian involvement from the American perspective, in the discussions between Israel and Moscow. Russia was reportedly willing to provide guarantees to prevent arms smuggling from Syria to Lebanon, but demands that the U.S. remove Russian companies from U.S. blacklists and sanctions.

How did the Jewish Federation keep thousands of Jews safe in D.C....	Jewish Federations of North America General Assembly takes place amid protests and antisemitic threats The Jewish Federations of North America General Assembly brought together 2,500 people at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in the heart of Washington, D.C. This event, one of the largest gatherings of Jewish people in America, took place amid rising antisemitism and violent Palestinian protests that have plagued the country since the onset of the Gaza and Lebanon conflicts. Shira Hutt, Executive Vice President of JFNA, told ILTV News that security is a top priority for the federation, with protocols in place from day one. 'It’s something that we always take very seriously,' Hutt told ILTV News. 'It is something that all of our 146 federations take very seriously, and we work with them to ensure that whenever they gather... everyone can be safe at those events, with no limitations on the community's ability to gather, flourish, and celebrate being Jewish.' Hutt shared that JFNA coordinated with security vendors, hotel staff, and local police. Additional security layers included Israeli and American secret service agents to protect President Isaac Herzog and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, both of whom spoke at the event. Attendees had to pass through metal detectors to enter the hotel, where dozens of police officers and hired security guards were stationed on every floor, along with security dogs. These measures were integrated into the conference in a way that kept people safe without disrupting the experience. Since 2018, following the tragic antisemitic attack at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue, the Jewish community has seen a $750 million investment in physical security through the LiveSecure initiative and the Nonprofit Security Grant Program. 'I think everyone that came into the conference felt good about the steps we took to ensure their safety,' Hutt added. William Daroff, CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, also put the situation into perspective. He said, 'In other times, there was government working against us, law enforcement working against us in the times of the shtetls and the tsars.' He noted that 'now, government is here being helpful—helping to protect us and safeguard us—and that is something different in the current fight we are in compared to previous fights.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjsspcmfyg	2024-11-13T22:53:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/11/14/Hk54h7Xzyg/Hk54h7Xzyg_11_259_445_251_0_small.jpg

Dutch police detain protesters supporting Palestine in war	Protesters defy ban on demonstrations after violent attacks against Israelis last week; The Netherlands has seen a rise in antisemitic incidents since the Gaza war began Police detained pro-Palestinian protesters rallying in central Amsterdam on Wednesday in defiance of a ban imposed after violence stemming from a football match between Ajax and Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv. Dozens of demonstrators, some with Palestinian flags, chanted 'Amsterdam is saying no to genocide' and 'Free Palestine'. Police in riot gear encircled the group and they were detained and put on buses. Police with expanded stop-and-search powers in the Dutch capital have detained or removed hundreds of demonstrators since last week's clashes under emergency measures imposed until Thursday. 'We say: Free Palestine. Stop killing innocent people. Stop killing the children,' said demonstrator Max van den Berg, 32, calling on the Netherlands to halt its support for Israel. Israel denies genocide in Gaza. It says that forces combating Palestinian Hamas terrorists that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, do not target civilians. Amsterdam's police department said Maccabi fans attacked a taxi and burned a Palestinian flag and were chased down and beaten by anti-Israeli gangs on scooters after an online appeal to taxi drivers. Five people were treated for injuries and released from hospitals. Police escorted hundreds of Maccabi fans to their hotels. Israeli and Dutch politicians have denounced the attacks as antisemitic and recalled persecution of Jews during World War Two. Pro-Palestinians countered that they responded to an attack by the Maccabi supporters and provocative anti-Arab chants. Four out of 62 suspects detained during the violence, which included 10 Israelis, remain in custody. Police are still looking for suspects. The Netherlands has seen a rise in antisemitic incidents since the Gaza war began in October last year. Less than 1% of Amsterdam's population is Jewish following the Holocaust, while around 15% is Muslim, mostly second and first-generation immigrants from North Africa and the Middle East. Additional arrests were made during rioting on Monday night in the predominantly immigrant neighborhood of West Amsterdam where Moroccan-Dutch youths sympathise with Palestinians in Gaza Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryqflzmfjg	2024-11-13T19:59:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/11/13/HkxNb1cfMyx/HkxNb1cfMyx_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Big dreams, bigger hearts: The stories of the six Golani soldiers...	Itay was a dedicated leader, Sraya was joyful and generous, Dror was a loyal protector, Nir was hardworking and kind, Shalev was a true-hearted fighter and Yoav a spirited champion; they put everything on the line to protect their home Since the outbreak of the war, 793 IDF soldiers have fallen in battle, six of them on Wednesday alone. They were identified as Captain Itay Marcovich, 22, from Kokhav Ya'ir; Staff Sergeant Sraya Elbom, 21, from Mehola; Staff Sergeant Dror Hen, 20, from Gan Haim; Staff Sergeant Nir Gofer, 20, from Dimona; Sergeant Shalev Itzhak Sagron, 21, from Sderot; and Sergeant Yoav Daniel, 19, from Nahariya, all from the Golani Brigade's 51st Battalion. There are their stories. 'Truly a remarkable person' Sergeant Shalev Itzhak Sagron, 21, from Sderot, served as a combat soldier in the 51st Battalion of the Golani Brigade. In a few months, he was due to begin a squad commanders' course. His sister, Renana, told Ynet that he 'was truly a remarkable person, with immense values and incredible strength.' She added, 'Anyone who knew him can attest to how pure-hearted he was.' The family moved to Sderot near the Gaza border in 2022, having previously lived in Moshav Nehalim in central Israel. 'During most rounds of fighting, we were evacuated,' she said. 'Shalev studied at the Nehalim yeshiva, where we also lived. He was passionate about Golani, dedicated to his service. He loved the army deeply—it was his dream to be a combat soldier.' 'About six months ago, his commander practically insisted he go to the course, but Shalev wanted to remain a soldier,' she continued. 'He always said, 'I want to be a combat soldier—nothing else.' He saw himself as a protector of Israel with his own body. He came home just before Simchat Torah, after a long time away, mostly in Lebanon. His arrival was filled with joy, and we shared special moments together. Looking back, I realize those were our last moments together—a sweet memory that will stay with us.' 'Our hearts can hardly bear the pain' Captain Itay Marcovich, 22, from Kokhav Ya'ir, served as a platoon commander in the Golani Brigade’s 51st Battalion. He is survived by his parents, Tami and Oren, and two siblings, Omri and Ella. His brother was injured in a Hezbollah drone attack on the Golani Brigade training base last month. Itay’s former teacher, Noa Shimoni, shared her memories: 'Another name added to the list of the fallen, another face I remember—the look in his eyes when the material interested him or when he suddenly understood the explanation, the laughter in class, the smile, the desire to understand why I gave the grade I did.' 'Itay Marcovich, of blessed memory. It’s surreal to write those words after your name. I will never forget you,' she added. The Kokhav Ya'ir-Tzur Yigal local council also paid tribute, saying, 'Our hearts can hardly bear the pain. The community mourns and embraces the beloved Marcovich family on the loss of their son Itay.' Itay will be laid to rest Thursday at 3:30 p.m. in the military section of the Kokhav Ya'ir cemetery. The council announced, 'The public is invited to pay final respects to Itay and to join the family with Israeli flags at 3:00 p.m., from the entrance square (near the Etgari Center) to the path leading to the cemetery.' 'He always looked after his soldiers' Staff Sergeant Dror Hen, 20, from Gan Haim, served as a squad sergeant in the 51st Battalion of the Golani Brigade. He is survived by his parents, Avital and Yisrael, and two brothers, Aviv and Ra'anan. Dror’s uncle, Zohar Hen, remembered him with deep emotion, saying, 'Our patriotic family cannot comprehend this. Dror served in Lebanon, just as I did in the reserves. He would joke about my helmet as a reservist compared to his tactical gear.' The uncle added that Dror 'never complained' and 'always looked after his soldiers in the Golani Brigade, where he was proud to serve.' 'He was a brilliant student,' his uncle shared. 'He could have gone to the Air Force or Unit 8200, but he made it clear to everyone in the family: only combat, only Golani.' The uncle said Dror felt immense joy in his service, sharing that on his last weekend home he had mentioned 'work still to be done.' Dror, who had a close bond with his two brothers, had also planned to pursue higher education after his service. 'He was incredibly talented—it’s a loss beyond words,' his uncle expressed. Ora Omer Katz, Dror’s mother’s cousin, paid tribute, writing, 'Dror, a Golani fighter, a charming young man and pride of the family. Our hearts are crushed with pain, struggling to believe this unbearable loss.' The Southern Sharon Regional Council announced that the funeral is set for Thursday at 2:00 p.m. at the Gan Haim cemetery and invited residents to 'bring flags along the main street of Gan Haim to accompany our beloved Dror on his final journey.' 'A hardworking young man' Staff Sergeant Nir Gofer, 20, from Dimona, served as a combat soldier in the 51st Battalion of the Golani Brigade. He is survived by his parents, Geula and Noam, and his siblings Uriah, Ran, Gil, Dikla and Idan. Dimona Mayor Benny Biton mourned his passing, writing, 'Nir was a hardworking young man, a computer whiz who chose combat service out of a desire to give back to his country. All of Dimona grieves his loss.' 'A joyful young man with deep values and boundless generosity' Staff Sergeant Sraya Elbom, 21, from Mehola, was a squad commander in the 51st Battalion of the Golani Brigade. He leaves behind his parents, Yael and Shai, and siblings Netanel, Hodaya, Eyal and Aviram. The Jordan Valley Regional Council paid tribute, saying, 'Sraya was a sociable, joyful young man, surrounded by friends, with deep values and boundless generosity. He left for combat in Gaza during his commanders’ course, returned to complete the course, and went straight into combat in Lebanon. He had only four months left until his discharge.' Yisrael, a close friend, also mourned him, writing, 'The sweetest, most beautiful kid, the one I loved and admired, the kid who was better and more dedicated than all of us—he fell in Lebanon.' He added, 'Sraya, how did you let God win? It makes no sense. Where did you go? I need you to come back for one last cigarette with me.' 'A true fighter' Sergeant Yoav Daniel, 19, from Nahariya, served as a soldier in the 51st Battalion of the Golani Brigade. He is survived by his parents, Revital and Shachar, and his sisters, Hadar and Stav. The Municipality of Nahariya expressed condolences, saying, 'We extend our embrace to the family during this difficult time. May they know no more sorrow. May his memory be a blessing.' Sparta Martial Arts Club in Haifa, where Yoav trained, also paid tribute, saying, 'With deep sadness and heartbreak, we say goodbye to a true fighter, friend and brother to many of us—Yoav Daniel, a unique spirit. He trained with us for two years, and from the start, his ever-present smile broke down all barriers. Being around Yoav meant constant laughter and lightheartedness, no matter the situation.' 'He quickly became part of the Sparta family,' they added. 'Yoav was an Israeli MMA champion for several years and even competed abroad, but he decided that serving as a combat soldier was his priority. Less than a year ago, we threw him a send-off party with one of his favorite things—food. I was incredibly proud of his decision to enlist in combat, and we had many talks about the importance of serving as a soldier, especially in times like these.' 'Sadly, Yoav belonged to a generation that joined the IDF during wartime, and that’s all he knew in his military service,' the club shared. 'Whenever he had leave, he would come to our open mats in Haifa and train with friends. We saw him just a few days ago, and everyone’s hearts are broken. Wherever he is now, I’m sure he’s smiling.'

Katz declares disarming Hezbollah as one of war goals	Defense minister says Israel will not agree to any arrangement that does not include disarming Hezbollah, pushing terror group beyond Litani River and creating conditions for safe return of northern residents to their homes Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Wednesday that disarming Hezbollah was one of Israel's goals in its war against the Lebanese terrorist group despite the Security Cabinet not approving such an objective. Speaking at a situation assessment in Northern Command, Katz added that the IDF 'Expanded ground operations in southern Lebanon and are targeting Hezbollah assets in Beirut’s Dahieh district and wherever else necessary.' 'While we’re here, terror infrastructures are collapsing in Beirut. We will not observe any cease-fires, ease up on the pressure or allow any resolution that doesn’t meet our war objectives—disarming Hezbollah, pushing them beyond the Litani River and creating conditions for northern residents to return home safely.' As far as is known, the only additional war objective for the north approved by the Security Cabinet as of September is the safe return of northern residents to their homes. Katz’s remarks come amid ongoing negotiations with the United States, with final terms being drafted regarding the northern border. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer is leading these discussions with Washington. Even the disarmament of Hezbollah up to the Litani River—which Israel demands as a condition for its withdrawal from Lebanese territory—was not part of the limited operation targeting villages near the border. South of the Litani, dozens of Shiite villages will remain with weapons that the IDF will not engage with on the ground, as it only focused on the villages directly along the border.

IDF reports 6 Golani soldiers killed in southern Lebanon combat, ...	CPT. Itay Marcovich, SST. Staff Sergeant Sraya Elbom, SST. Dror Hen, SST. Nir Gofer and SGT. Shalev Itzhak Sagron, all from Golani Brigade's 51st Battalion, killed in ambush during operational activity; sixth soldier yet to be named The IDF reported that six Golani Brigade soldiers were killed Wednesday morning in a firefight with Hezbollah terrorists in a village in southern Lebanon. Another soldier was moderately wounded in the encounter. Five of them were identified as Captain Itay Marcovich, 22, from Kokhav Ya'ir; Staff Sergeant Sraya Elbom, 21, from Mehola; Staff Sergeant Dror Hen, 20, from Gan Haim; Staff Sergeant Nir Gofer, 20, from Dimona; and Sergeant Shalev Itzhak Sagron, 21, from Sderot, all from the Golani Brigade's 51st Battalion. A sixth soldier has yet to be named. The unit entered the sector the previous night as part of the 36th Division's operation to conduct sweeps near the Lebanese border. An initial military probe indicates that at approximately 10 a.m., a detachment of Golani troops entered a building where terrorists had been lying in wait and opened fire at close range. The IDF suspects the terrorists emerged from a concealed underground tunnel, avoiding prior Israeli airstrikes on the area. A fierce, close-quarters battle ensued, resulting in the elimination of at least one Hezbollah fighter, with clashes continuing for several hours until control was secured. This operation followed a period of brief respite for many Israeli brigades operating in southern Lebanon, as reserve forces were partially withdrawn. However, with the government extending the war amid stalled political negotiations, Northern Command prepared additional operations. Ynet military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai noted that, as in past phases of combat, Israeli forces faced heavy resistance upon penetrating deeply entrenched enemy defenses. He added that Hezbollah, having observed Israeli tactics and learned from public statements, fortified the area and positioned ambush teams in the village structures. The intense confrontation resulted in the loss of Israeli soldiers, though it led to a significant reduction in short-range rocket launches by Hezbollah as IDF forces advanced. President Isaac Herzog paid tribute to the fallen soldiers, saying, 'Along with the entire people of Israel, I received with deep sorrow and pain the news of the loss of six Golani fighters, heroes of Israel, who fell defending our homeland in combat with Hezbollah.' He added, 'They fight for us with courage, bravery and self-sacrifice for the protection of our people and land. Each one of them is a world unto himself, and behind every name is a family whose world has been shattered. I embrace the grieving families, alongside all families who have lost loved ones in this fierce battle and pray for the swift recovery of all those injured in body and soul.'

Watch: IDF shares footage of Navy and ground forces working together in Lebanon operations, where submarines and missile boats target terrorists; strikes eliminate senior Hamas and Hezbollah operatives and hit strategic facilities The IDF on Wednesday evening released footage of Navy operations amid ongoing fighting in Lebanon, showcasing defensive and offensive missions at sea, where submarines and missile boats joined ground forces to eliminate terrorists. In one video, Navy forces, with intelligence assistance from Shin Bet and Naval Intelligence, killed Said Alaa Naif Ali, a senior operative in Hamas' military wing in Lebanon. who was responsible for planning attacks against Israeli targets and recruiting operatives for Hamas in Lebanon. In a separate strike led by Air Force intelligence, the IDF confirmed it had killed Ali Barakat, a central figure in Hezbollah's Unit 127, specializing in aerial operations. The operations were coordinated through the Navy's fire control center in close collaboration with the Northern Command, the Air Force and Military Intelligence. In another operation led by Naval Intelligence, Israeli fighter jets targeted Hezbollah’s main naval base in Beirut. The facility, serving as a key operational center, housed dozens of vessels and was used for training Hezbollah’s naval force in attacks on Israeli maritime and strategic targets. Meanwhile, a senior Israeli official told Ynet on Wednesday that talks with the United States on a political arrangement to end fighting against Hezbollah on the northern border are in their final drafting stages, with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer leading the efforts with Washington. At the center of the talks is a supplement intended to secure Israel’s operational freedom in case of violations by Lebanon. 'This is the most important thing for Israel,' the official stressed. 'We have clear understandings with the Americans,' he added. 'In cases of weapons smuggling from Syria, Hezbollah's rearmament or attempts at attacks — we’ll have backing to act.' He noted that the agreement with Washington is especially significant amid the ongoing tensions between the countries. 'The arrangement and legitimacy to act are very important to us.'

Israel, US zero in on final draft for Lebanon cease-fire, officia...	US-mediated talks reportedly nearing completion on agreement aimed at pushing Hezbollah back from border while ensuring Israel retains operational freedom should terms be violated Talks with the United States on a political arrangement to end fighting against Hezbollah on the northern border are in their final drafting stages, with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer leading the efforts with Washington, a senior Israeli official told Ynet on Wednesday. At the center of the talks is a supplement intended to secure Israel’s operational freedom in case of violations by Lebanon. 'This is the most important thing for Israel,' the official stressed. 'We have clear understandings with the Americans,' he added. 'In cases of weapons smuggling from Syria, Hezbollah's rearmament or attempts at attacks — we’ll have backing to act.' He noted that the agreement with Washington is especially significant amid the ongoing tensions between the countries. 'The arrangement and legitimacy to act are very important to us.' The main terms of the emerging arrangement include Hezbollah's withdrawal north of the Litani River, deployment of the Lebanese army in the country's south and prevention of weapons smuggling and deliveries from Syria. Israeli representatives, including Dermer, have visited Moscow to try to enlist Russia's influence in pressuring Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime alongside talks with the Americans. 'We’re already attacking in Syria, including military targets,' the official revealed. Israel believes Russian President Vladimir Putin has an interest in preventing harm to Assad's regime that could potentially come from the continuation of weapons transfers to Hezbollah. The officials also stressed, however, that there’s still significant doubt about Lebanon's willingness to agree to the arrangement. 'You can reach understandings with the U.S., but the Lebanese can ultimately say no,' he noted. In that case, Israel has alternative operational plans and 'won’t sit idly by nor allow this state of attrition to continue,' and it will act 'with greater intensity,' in Lebanon until an arrangement is achieved. A clearer assessment of the deal’s chances of being accepted is expected within the next two weeks. If finalized, the agreement will be presented for approval by Israel’s Security Cabinet and may also require a vote in the Knesset.

FBI arrests CIA agent in Pentagon leak scandal, report says	Suspect in classified document leak detailing Israel's preparations for attack on Iran identified as Asif William Rahman, CIA operative with top-secret clearance; Rahman arrested in Cambodia and expected to appear before judge in Guam The FBI has arrested a suspect in Cambodia linked to the leak of classified Pentagon documents detailing Israel’s preparations for its attack on Iran, The New York Times reported Wednesday afternoon. According to court documents and sources familiar with the case, the suspect, identified as Asif William Rahman, is a CIA officer who had been working outside the United States. The Times cited court filings indicating that Rahman had a security clearance granting him access to top-secret information, similar to many CIA employees handling classified material. The CIA declined to comment on the report. Rahman was reportedly detained in Cambodia on Tuesday, following the filing of charges against him last week in a federal court in Virginia. He faces two counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information. He is expected to appear in court on Thursday in Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific Ocean. The two classified documents were leaked last month during Israel’s preparations for a potential response to a barrage of ballistic missiles launched by Iran on October 1. According to at least one foreign media report, which Israel later denied, the leak caused a delay in its response, which eventually came three weeks after the missile strike in an operation called Days of Repentance. The documents, dated October 15 and 16 and marked 'Top Secret,' first surfaced on a pro-Iran Telegram channel before being shared on X (formerly Twitter). They were reportedly produced by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), which analyzes data and images gathered by U.S. spy satellites. Their security classification restricts sharing to the Five Eyes alliance, an intelligence-sharing network among the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The leaked documents detail Israeli preparations for an attack on Iran, including a 'large-scale deployment drill' by the Israeli Air Force and an aerial refueling exercise. One document states that the Air Force was working with air-launched ballistic missiles, and, since October 8, had engaged with at least 16 missiles labeled 'Golden Horizon' and at least 40 of another model known as ISO2 or Rocks. The specifics of the 'Golden Horizon' missile remain unclear, as it has not been previously disclosed by Israel or other sources. The Rocks missile, however, was unveiled by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems in 2019 and is described on the company’s website as an air-to-surface missile equipped with a lethal warhead, capable of destroying targets both above ground and in fortified underground locations.

Israel and Hezbollah prepare for a winter war	As winter intensifies, the conflict in Lebanon raises questions about weather impacts on warfare, especially with floods hitting Beirut; Experts say weather affects ground operations more than air, possibly putting pressure on negotiations – but it won't halt determined military actions As winter firmly establishes itself, the ongoing conflict on the northern border prompts questions, even among Arab states, about the implications of changing weather conditions on military operations. In Lebanon, the onset of winter was strongly felt earlier this week. On Sunday evening, videos and images circulated showing floods in the streets of Beirut, including the tunnel leading to Rafic Hariri International Airport, adjacent to Dahieh, a Hezbollah stronghold. Heavy rains caused flooding that trapped people in their vehicles. Lebanese civil defense teams rescued those trapped, especially in the areas of Al-Hadath and A-Shweifat in Dahieh. Winter floods are not uncommon on the streets of Lebanon. However, unlike previous years, this year sees intense fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, with significant strikes deep into Lebanon after last winter’s strikes focused mainly on border villages and towns. The Lebanese Al-Mayadeen network, affiliated with Hezbollah, reported early Wednesday morning that Israeli Air Force planes continued to attack Dahieh, conducting about nine strikes on Hezbollah's stronghold by morning. These strikes followed a field tour and situational assessment in southern Lebanon by IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and the Northern Command commander. During the tour, Halevi told the soldiers: 'The IDF is working very hard in parallel, we heavily attacked Hezbollah targets. We are attacking deep and extensively in Syria and the Syria-Lebanon border to prevent weapons from reaching Hezbollah. Clearing this area will provide us with the basic conditions to do the right things, so that in the valley below it will truly be safe.' An article in the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat published in London in Arabic, discussed the expected impact of the rainy season on the war. It reported that winter is likely to delay the war but not stop it. The greatest impact is expected to be on ground combat, but even here, the impact is limited, mainly on the movement of soldiers and vehicles. According to experts, military actions relying on the Air Force will be even less affected, considering that winter in the region is not defined as severe compared to other parts of the world. One interviewee in the Saudi newspaper, a former senior Lebanese army officer named Abd al-Rahman Shahatili, claimed that the weather has 'no significant impact on the battle, as means have already been developed to fight under all conditions.' He argued that rain and fog in winter complicate ground combat but also help both sides, as they blur vision and assist Hezbollah fighters in both attacking and defending by camouflaging themselves. According to him, Israel, with its more advanced equipment, has an advantage in winter conditions, while Hezbollah fighters have to move on muddy and unpaved roads, complicating their activities. The article also noted that winter affects the morale of fighters and the living conditions of those who left their homes due to the war, which could lead to pressure to promote negotiations and a political settlement to end the war. Another former senior Lebanese army officer named Hassan Jouni told the newspaper that if there is a decision to continue the war, winter will not stop it. He claimed that the weather actually affects the attacker more than the attacked, and Hezbollah is prepared, familiar with the terrain and geography of southern Lebanon, and its targets are known. According to Jouni, because of Hezbollah's familiarity with the terrain, it is less affected by cold and rainy weather. He did note the impact of winter weather on vehicle movement but clarified that it is a limited impact that will not hinder continued fighting. He added that it is not extreme weather conditions, such as snow, heavy rains, and strong winds in the region, that are supposed to affect aerial activity, and that advanced aircraft, missiles and drones exist that can operate in such conditions.

Erdogan claims Turkey has 'severed ties with Israel'	In the wake of criticism in local media of Turkey's 'secret financial ties', Turkish president – who has spoken out harshly against Netanyahu since the beginning of the war – tells reporters that his country has severed relations with Israel; Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv is still operating and Jerusalem says not informed about cut in ties Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday told reporters that his country has severed diplomatic relations with Israel, although Jerusalem has not been informed of this. 'A Republic of Turkey that is headed by Tayyip Erdogan can't continue to develop its relationship with Israel. We have no such intention,' he was quoted as saying by local TV channel TRT Harber. 'We have cut trade and ties with Israel, period.' Since the beginning of the war, Erdogan has often made statements against Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Israel's policy in the Gaza Strip since the October 7 massacre. His announcement comes in in the wake of severe criticism of Erdogan in the Turkish media, where it is claimed that, contrary to his harsh public statements, there are apparently 'secret economic ties' with Israel. Turkey withdrew its ambassador in Israel for consultations after the Gaza war broke out, but has not officially severed its ties with Israel and its embassy remains open and operational. Erdogan also said on Wednesday that he still hopes meet with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to repair ties with the neighboring country, broadcaster CNN Turk reported. 'Restoring ties with Bashar al-Assad will soothe regional tensions, hopefully,' Erdogan was quoted as telling reporters on his flight back from Azerbaijan. Erdogan said he hopes U.S. President-elect Donald Trump would take a different approach on the Middle East during his term, but that some of the messages coming from his side were concerning, broadcaster NTV reported on Wednesday. 'It seems too early to me to make observations about this,' Erdogan told reporters on a return flight from Baku. 'Our hope is that Trump takes very different steps toward the region this term because the messages being given from time to time concern us,' he was cited as saying. Erdogan also reportedly said that Turkey could take joint steps with billionaire businessman Elon Musk on technology if opportunities for cooperation in that field arise, broadcaster TRT Haber reported. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday named Musk to a role aimed at creating a more efficient government, handing even more influence to the world's richest man who donated millions of dollars to helping Trump get elected. 'Musk is a businessman who works in the space and technology field,' Erdogan told reporters on the return flight from Baku. 'Technology isn't a field you can advance on your own, you absolutely need some cooperation. In the event cooperation opportunities arise in this field, steps can be taken with Musk,' he was cited as saying.

Israel calls on ICC in Hague to check neutrality of judge on pane...	The State of Israel on Wednesday submitted an unusual request to the International Criminal Court in The Hague (ICC), which is discussing the request of Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes in the Gaza Strip. The appeal concerns a request by Israel to check the neutrality of Judge Beti Hohler from Slovenia, who was recently added to the panel of judges in the case. Israel wants to make sure that the judge's previous involvement in the international prosecutor's office did not include access to secret information or involvement in discussions related to legal issues dealing with the Palestinians, which could harm her neutrality in the case of Netanyahu and Gallant.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryh69fgzjx	2024-11-13T03:31:24-08:00	
Erdogan hopes for new U.S. approach after 'concerning' Trump mess...	Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said he hopes U.S. President-elect Donald Trump would take a different approach on the Middle East during his term, but that some of the messages coming from his side were concerning, broadcaster NTV reported on Wednesday. 'It seems too early to me to make observations about this,' Erdogan told reporters on a return flight from Baku. 'Our hope is that Trump takes very different steps toward the region this term because the messages being given from time to time concern us,' he was cited as saying. Asked about Turkey's decision to halt all trade with Israel in May, Erdogan said Ankara had no trade ties with Israel at the moment and no desire to develop them. Turkey withdrew its ambassador in Israel for consultations after the Gaza war broke out, but has not officially severed its ties with Israel and its embassy remains open and operational. Erdogan also said China and Russia had signed an initiative that Turkey launched at the United Nations to impose a weapons embargo on Israel.

US wants real, extended pauses in fighting in Gaza, Blinken says	The United States wants real and extended pauses in fighting in Gaza so assistance can get to people who need it, but the best way to help people would be to end the war, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday. 'Israel, by the standards it set itself, has accomplished the goals that it set for itself,' Blinken told reporters during a visit to Brussels. 'This should be a time to end the war.' On Tuesday, after the expiration of a 30-day U.S. deadline for Israel to take steps to address the humanitarian situation in Gaza, Washington said Israel was not blocking aid to Gaza and therefore not violating U.S. law. Eight international aid groups said Israel had failed to meet the U.S. demands to improve access for assistance.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1c3lwmf1e	2024-11-13T02:01:09-08:00	
Saudi-Iranian geopolitical romance blossoms as Israel is cast asi...	Saudi Arabia and Iran, under the watchful mediation of China, are engaged in rebuilding relations marked by joint military exercises and economic cooperation, which strategically positions Saudi Arabia as a humanitarian conduit for Iran amid American sanctions; Normalization with Israel is not on the menu, at least for now A Sino-crafted rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran is currently unfolding. Just last month, Abbas Araqchi, Iran's foreign minister, didn't merely settle for a handshake with Saudi Arabia's Faisal bin Farhan. Instead, he was whisked off to a high-stakes meeting with the Crown Prince himself, Mohammed bin Salman. Beijing has been heavily involved in rekindling the love-hate relationship between Tehran and Riyadh. As the Middle Kingdom continues its whisper campaign, it nudged both nations to host Saudi Chief of Staff Fayyadh Al-Ruwaili in Tehran over a tense weekend. These ties, once severed by seven years of bitterness and shadowed by Iran's whispered denials of attacks on Saudi oil sanctuaries, are being meticulously reconstructed. The focus is now on joint military pirouettes in the Red Sea and economic bridges, with Saudi Arabia playing the role of a humanitarian lifeline, circumventing American embargoes to nourish Iran with essential goods. At an emergency summit in the heart of Riyadh, one year to the day since the Arab-Islamic conclave of 2023, the stage was set for a parade of Arab and Islamic leaders. Notably absent was Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian, his seat filled by a deputy bearing apologies and the weight of internal 'preparations' for an Israeli showdown. Crown Prince bin Salman's opening salvo was nothing short of a rhetorical missile aimed squarely at Israeli ears. His audacious critique sidelined American aspirations of brokering a Saudi-Israeli détente, as he boldly demanded a 'full withdrawal' from Gaza and the West Bank, and an immediate cessation of Israeli military maneuvers in Lebanon. His narrative expanded to include strikes in Iran and its proxies, a nod to Syria, Lebanon, and the Iraq-Syria border. In an interview with Ynet and Yedioth Aharonoth, a high-ranking academic and confidant of the Saudi elite offered a nuanced perspective. 'Prince bin Salman is a strategist with foresight, his gaze fixed on both the immediate and the horizon. Yes, he took a hard line against Israel at the summit, but the Israeli dossier is merely out of sight, not out of mind. The dialogue on relations will resume, but not now,' he said. Bin Salman's forceful oration directly addressed Israeli conduct, tracking IDF movements across multiple fronts, from Gaza to the depths of Iran, even touching upon Iraq. Curiously absent from Riyadh’s discourse were the Houthis of Yemen, a silence dictated by Saudi calculus. 'This summit's true audience resides in Washington. That it convened in Saudi Arabia, not Egypt, speaks volumes,' an anonymous Saudi commentator confided. 'The Crown Prince has seized the reins, leaving President el-Sisi to swallow his pride and follow suit, a reluctant participant in the reshaping of Arab leadership dynamics.' Professor Farid, another discreet Saudi voice, painted this diplomatic dance as a cautious yet bold pivot, not a robust peace but an artful maneuver. 'This pivot began with embassy doors reopening in Tehran and Riyadh and continues relentlessly. It's fraught with peril, yet both parties tread carefully,' he said. Speculations abound of a Saudi gambit delivered to the incoming U.S. president, Donald Trump, a proposal to thaw Washington-Tehran relations. Advisers on both sides are acutely aware of each other’s Achilles' heels. The American gaze never wavers from Iran's nuclear ambitions, while Tehran’s leadership expertly plays the Washington tune. Dr. Yoel Guzansky of the Institute for National Security Studies posits: 'The Saudis aim for a pragmatic rapprochement with Iran, seeking to sidestep the looming crossfire of an Iranian-Israeli flare-up anticipated before Trump's inauguration. Their pro-Iranian rhetoric is a strategic message of non-alignment with Israel’s actions.' The silence on Saudi internal affairs and human rights from Washington is deafening, as the Saudis pin their hopes on Trump pressuring Netanyahu to swiftly conclude conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, and to make strides on the Palestinian issue – a façade of progress toward a two-state solution. Today's bin Salman is a ruler transformed, his power and clarity sharpened over four years, yet his wary eye remains on Iran. Trump’s promise to quell wars resonates in Riyadh with Saudi Arabia, followed by Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon, poised for a shift in Washington’s winds. Their demand: An American arms embargo on Israel to halt the Israeli offensive. Hezbollah and Hamas were mere footnotes at the summit, as the Crown Prince gears up to collaborate with President Trump, painting a bleak tableau to 'end all wars.'

He added: 'If the prime minister was a reservist, the request would have been accepted, so if the prime minister is running the entire war and there are weeks when it is impossible to meet with him, then should that be ignored?

A sign of life and psychological terror, after more than 13 months in hell: Islamic Jihad releases for the third time since start of war a video of the hostage, who hold Russian citizenship; On Tuesday he celebrated his 29th birthday in captivity; Hostage's mother: 'We are all waiting for him to come back. What keeps me going is prayers and support from people I meet on the street' Islamic Jihad published released on Wednesday a several-minute video of hostage Sasha Trufanov , who has been held captive in Gaza for 404 days. Trufanov marked his 29th birthday this week, he second birthday he has spent in captivity. The family has not yet approved making the video and the things said in it public. On May 28, and also two days later, the terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip released videos of Trupanov from captivity. Sasha, who has Russian citizenship, was abducted on October 7 along with his mother Yelena, his grandmother Irena Tati, and his friend Sapir Cohen from the family home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. The three women were released in the hostage deal at the end of November, after 54 and 55 days in captivity. Sasha's father, Vitali, was massacred by Hamas terrorists on October 7. Sasha and his friend Sapir, who were visiting the kibbutz at the time of the surprise attack, were abducted to Gaza along with their mother Yelena and grandmother Irena Tati. In the last message he sent to his friends before he was kidnapped, Trofanov wrote: 'It's a shame I came to visit the kibbutz this weekend with Sapir.' From what Trufanov says in the video released on Wednesday, more than 13 months after the October 7, 2023 massacre, it is clear that it was filmed recently, although it is not certain exactly what day. Trofanov's upper body is all that is seen in the video. On Tuesday, the hostage's mother, Yelena, was interviewed by Ynet. In a special interview to mark her son's second birthday in captivity, she said that 'all the efforts until now have not brought any results.' Yelena Trufanov said that she hopes another deal will be struck under the radar. 'When there is too much talk, it's a deal that won't happen,' she said. Yelena said that her son is 'a smart, good and beautiful guy, as any mother would say. We are all waiting for him to come back already. What keeps me going is faith, prayers and support from the people I meet on the street. They tell me 'our hearts are with you', we pray and remember the support.'

Mike Huckabee says 'Incredibly honored' to serve as U.S. ambassad...	Huckabee, appointed by President-elect Trump, tells Army Radio it's an 'extraordinary opportunity to represent my country to a land that I have loved since I first visited there in 1973' Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who previously ran for U.S. president in the Republican primaries, is still processing President-elect Donald Trump’s announcement appointing him as the next U.S. ambassador to Israel. 'I'm just incredibly honored that the president would ask me to serve in this capacity,' he told Army Radio Wednesday morning. Huckabee spoke about his many visits to Israel, the first nearly 52 years ago. 'On a personal level, this is an extraordinary opportunity to be able to represent my country to a land that I have loved since I first visited there in July of 1973. Having taken tens of thousands of Americans to see the land, I can't tell you what a joy it is to be able to serve in this capacity,' he said. He addressed the possibility that the incoming Trump administration would support the annexation and extension of Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank. 'I have been a frequent visitor to Judea and Samaria, and I also firmly believe that the people of Israel deserve a safe country. Anything I can do to accommodate that that would be a big privilege for me.' However, he clarified, 'I won't make the policy, but I will execute the policy of the president, and he has already demonstrated in his first term that there has never been an American president that has been more helpful in securing an understanding of the sovereignty of Israel. From the moving of the embassy to recognizing the Golan Heights and Jerusalem as the capital, no one has done more than President Trump – and I fully expect that to continue.' Concerning a return to the Gaza Strip, he was notably more cautious. 'Today has been a pretty intense day, receiving literally hundreds of calls, emails, text messages, so, you know, I don’t want to make any comments about policy because those won't be mine to make,' he said. Huckabee, who will replace Amb. Jack Lew, a Joe Biden appointment, ran in the Republican presidential primaries in 2008, losing to John McCain, and eight years later losing to Trump. By training, he is an evangelical pastor, aligned with the Christian evangelical right in the U.S., and defines himself as a staunch supporter of Israel. He has also worked as a political commentator on Fox News. In 2015, while running for the Republican Party's presidential nomination, Huckabee visited the ancient West Bank site of Shiloh, the site of the biblical tabernacle. 'Judea and Samaria are an inseparable part of the State of Israel and everyone needs to understand that. Anyone running for the presidency of the United States should visit here,' he said while at Shiloh, using the biblical designations for the West Bank. In an interview with Ynet at the time he said that 'Israel needs to control Judea and Samaria'. He said, among other things, that Jewish settlement is 'a factor leading to regional peace.'

Biden to host hostage families at White House; Trump passes on me...	Hostage families with American citizenship will meet President Joe Biden at the White House on Wednesday, emphasizing the bipartisan effort with President-elect Donald Trump to secure their release; Despite a request by the families to meet the President-elect, who also is scheduled to see Biden on Wednesday, Trump declined citing 'schedule constraints' Families of hostages still held in Gaza, who are also U.S. citizens, are set to meet with President Joe Biden at the White House on Wednesday evening at around 10:00 p.m. Israel time. Biden also plans to meet with President-elect Donald Trump during the day, although Trump will not attend the meeting with the hostage families. This marks the third such gathering at the White House since the outbreak of the conflict. 'Our aim is to encourage the outgoing administration to collaborate vigorously and decisively with the incoming administration to resolve the situation and bring the hostages home. They must do whatever it takes,' Ronen Neutra, father of hostage Omer, told Ynet. This meeting with Biden follows a nighttime engagement during which families met with White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. They urged him and the administration to work with Trump and his transition team, dedicating all available resources to sign an agreement that will bring all the hostages back to Israel before Biden's term ends. In their 14th meeting with Sullivan since the war began, the families expressed gratitude for the administration's support for Israel. Sullivan reiterated the administration's 'unwavering commitment to bringing the hostages home,' emphasizing that the issue remains 'a top priority for President Biden.' 'After meeting with Sullivan, we encouraged him to engage with his new counterpart and begin collaborative efforts,' Neutra explained. 'Many new team members were appointed tonight, and it's crucial for these teams to start meeting. That was our objective, and we hope these meetings will expedite the process.' Neutra also noted that Trump conveyed his desire to resolve the hostage issue before taking office, with three months available to achieve this. 'Now we must work with full force and, ultimately, both leaders deserve credit if they succeed. It's up to them now. We are very hopeful to hear from President Biden that this issue transcends party lines and that the teams will quickly commence joint work.' Meanwhile, sources from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said that the families made a request for an official meeting with Trump, but due to the president-elect's 'schedule constraints,' it did not materialize. On Tuesday, President Isaac Herzog met with Biden, expressing gratitude for his continued support for Israel throughout his presidency. Herzog acknowledged Biden's efforts for the hostages' release and stressed that Israel is preparing for the 'day after' in Gaza, but emphasized that the hostages' return is paramount. The president agreed. At the meeting's conclusion, Herzog remarked that he anticipates the coming period will present 'many challenges related to Israel's security and numerous critical issues concerning bilateral relations.'

Russia asks Israel to avoid attacks near its base in Syria	Russia asked Israel to refrain from airstrikes near its air base in Syria, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin's envoy to Syria, Alexander Lavrentiev. Last month, state media in Syria reported on an Israeli airstrike in the port city of Latakia, one of the bastions of control of Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is supported by Russia. The city is close to the Russian base. 'Israel did attack from the air in the vicinity of the base,' Lavrentiev said in an interview with the Russian news agency RIA. 'Our army informed Israeli officials that such actions, which could endanger the lives of army personnel, are unacceptable.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjiltczfkl	2024-11-12T22:47:04-08:00	
‘October 7 changed everything’: Inside the Jewish world’s bold ne...	Kol Ha’am CEO says new voices are needed After October 7 and a year of war, is it time to bring new voices into the Jewish community? According to Shirel Dagan-Levy, CEO of Voice of the People (Kol Ha’am), an initiative by President Isaac Herzog, 'our strength is to have diverse voices.' Dagan-Levy attended all three days of the Jewish Federations of North America General Assembly, where she met with both established and emerging Jewish communal leaders. An Israeli with a background in high-tech, Dagan-Levy has been tasked with launching the president’s Kol Ha’am initiative, which aims to create a global Jewish advisory council to address pressing issues impacting Jewish communities worldwide. She told ILTV News that the GA was both inspiring and emphasized the necessity of the Kol Ha’am project. 'On the one hand, I see the strength. I mean, this is unbelievable. I mean, people, for years, are doing for the Jewish community. I'm overwhelmed. I'm humbled,' she told ILTV. 'I think people in Israel don't realize how much people here care. They just don't realize.' On the other hand, she said, 'we need to bring new voices and new ideas and tackle [the challenges in the Jewish world] differently.' Her goal: To manage this tension and turn it into discussion and action. Kol Ha’am launched two years ago, before the October 7 massacre. But soon after the attack, the president realized the concept needed to be reimagined. His office sent a survey to the global Jewish community, which more than 10,000 people answered. It asked questions about the most important issues in the Jewish community and how they could be addressed. Then, the project opened an application process to create a cohort of 150 people—50 from Israel, 50 from the United States, and another 50 from around the world. Around 1,000 people applied. The application process was powered by artificial intelligence to ensure the cohort would be as diverse and representative as possible. Applicants filled out AI-driven forms, which the algorithm narrowed down to a list of about 400 of the most suitable candidates. Now, the human team must sift through these resumes. 'We got unbelievable names of people,' Dagan-Levy said. 'We’re looking for the non-usual suspects. I mean, we want the usual suspects, but I think we have an opportunity post-October 7 to bring new voices, young voices, voices that have never stood up before.' The goal is for 75% of participants to be under the age of 50. They are aiming for a balanced representation of men and women, Orthodox and non-Orthodox, business professionals, and individuals already deeply engaged in the Jewish world. Dagan-Levy noted that many young Jews who had never previously engaged with Jewish life or discussed Judaism are now starting to get involved since October 7. 'They want to step up and do something,' she said. The Kol Ha’am team is also interviewing moderators and facilitators, aiming to launch 10 working groups on different topics by early winter. The first cohort is expected to be announced in mid-December and will serve for two years. 'This is not a think tank,' Dagan-Levy emphasized. 'I want them to come up with actionable solutions… How can we actually change reality? We want those proactive leaders to come as thinkers and doers.' Dagan-Levy is herself one of these proactive individuals. She spent most of her career in high-tech, but after October 7, while serving as CEO of a startup, she felt that 'everything seemed irrelevant,' and she sought greater meaning. Kol Ha’am was a perfect fit. 'I think the magic of President Herzog is that in these very difficult, hard days, he is able to look to the future and say, you know, we have to look at the future and take care of it, because no one else is going to do it for us,' she told ILTV. 'Unless we are going to do something about it, no one else is going to do something about it. So, I think the initiative, now more than ever, is needed.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkkby6bz1l	2024-11-12T21:42:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/11/13/SyAiF611M1x/SyAiF611M1x_0_695_1200_676_0_small.jpg

Expert: Israel cannot claim victory over Hezbollah	Avraham Levine of Alma Center ells ILTV News that Hezbollah and Lebanon are different Israel cannot and should not claim victory over Hezbollah, according to an expert from Israel’s North. 'Until we bring our people back to the north, our kids back to school, safely back to normal life here in the North, until then, while Hezbollah is shooting rockets, we cannot claim victory,' said Avraham Levine of the Alma Research and Education Center. He added, 'We have eliminated many of the command, but we still haven’t beaten Hezbollah.' Levine also cautioned that Israel should distinguish between Lebanon and Hezbollah. He explained that while Lebanon is ready for a ceasefire, it is unclear if Hezbollah will agree to such an arrangement. 'I do not see that happening, but a de facto agreement with Hezbollah might be on its way,' Levine said.

Will Trump recognize Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria in ...	Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich claims new U.S. administration will end demand for Palestinian state Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who heads the National Religious Party, stated at a press conference that he hopes the incoming Trump administration will recognize Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria in 2025 and put an end to U.S. demands for a Palestinian state. 'The year 2025 will be, with God's help, the year of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria,' Smotrich said. 'I instructed the Settlement Administration at the Security Ministry and the Civil Administration to begin professional and comprehensive staff work and prepare in practice the necessary infrastructure for the application of sovereignty.' Smotrich expressed his belief that Trump can lead the way to a truly new Middle East. 'Following this past year, we are the strongest in the Middle East,' Smotrich said. 'We will apply sovereignty together with our American friends. We’ll extend the agreements and alliances with neighboring countries, and we’ll create a true new Middle East.' Meanwhile, anti-terror operations are ongoing in Judea and Samaria. IDF forces and the Shin Bet arrested Hamas operatives in a series of sweeps targeting wanted men in several towns. The army has been working intensively since last October to contain an upsurge in terrorist violence in the region. The Ephraim Division arrested four wanted men and confiscated a drone and military equipment. Three additional suspects were arrested by the Shomron Division. There were no casualties among IDF forces.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1izdawmyl	2024-11-12T21:31:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/07/01/HJRFwmgwR/HJRFwmgwR_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg
‘Antisemitism is problem of left, right’	ILTV News reports from the Jewish Federation of North America’s General Assembly In the heart of Washington, D.C., Jewish communities from around the world came together to make their voices heard at the 2024 Jewish Federations of North America General Assembly. The three-day event, which began on Sunday, brought together over 2,500 Jews from across North America and beyond to discuss today’s most pressing issues. The event unfolded in the shadow of a series of antisemitic attacks. 'Antisemitism is not a Jewish problem,' said JTA Washington Bureau Chief Ron Kampeas. 'It's a non-Jewish problem. It's a problem of the Christian community. It's a problem of certain Muslim communities. For sure, it's a problem of the left. It's a problem of the right.' The conference also served as an opportunity to shape the Jewish future, amplifying local voices, deepening connections to shared culture and heritage, and creating lasting change for future generations. 'One thing we have learned since October 7 is that on the days after October 7, when we look to our left and our right to see our friends who we thought were there—the friends who we had marched with, the friends that we had advocated for—we found that so many of them were not there,' said William Daroff, CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. 'One thing that has crystallized is that we as a Jewish community need to count on and can really count on each other, and we're only as strong as we are unified,' he continued. 'I think that that's an area that is focused here, and I think it's the direction that we as a community need to continue to go in order to ensure that we will survive and thrive as we have for thousands of years.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skembabgjg	2024-11-12T21:27:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/11/13/SyVL8TWMJe/SyVL8TWMJe_0_0_957_539_0_small.jpg

Actor John Krasinski named People magazine's 'sexiest man alive'	Actor and director John Krasinski was named People magazine's 'sexiest man alive' for 2024 on Wednesday, taking over the mantle from 'Grey's Anatomy' actor Patrick Dempsey. The actor is perhaps best known for his sardonic nice guy role in the television comedy 'The Office'. Krasinski, 45, lives in Brooklyn with his wife of 14 years, actress Emily Blunt, 41, and their daughters Hazel, 10, and Violet, 8. Recently, Krasinski has directed the comedy 'IF' and the dramas 'A Quiet Place' and 'A Quiet Place Part II,' both featuring Blunt in a leading role. However, he noted that the new title will change things very little around the house. 'I think it's going to make me do more household chores,' he joked.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1jpvt11mkx	2024-11-12T21:20:01-08:00

Yarden Salem and Liel Madmon hit the ground on a hillside in Hod Hasharon, already dressed in a wedding gown and suit, during a rocket barrage targeting central Israel; 'A classic moment capturing an Israeli couple getting married in the shadow of war'; See the photos Newlyweds-to-be Yarden Salem and Liel Madmon, from Kadima, experienced a dramatic moment during their wedding photo shoot on Tuesday at the ecological garden in Hod Hasharon. In the midst of the session, just hours before their wedding ceremony, a rocket siren sounded, forcing the couple to seek cover while dressed in their wedding gown and suit. 'There wasn’t a nearby shelter,' said Ilan Lorentzky, a press and wedding photographer who, along with fellow photographer Arnon Cohen, captured the couple's exciting day on film. 'We moved to the side of a hill, crouched down, and covered our heads. The Iron Dome interceptions were right above us, and we could hear the terrifying explosions. This is our reality, but we’ll keep celebrating tonight – we have to find joy.' 'This is our reality, but we’ll keep celebrating tonight – we have to find joy' Liel, the bride, shared: 'While we were crouching, we started singing ‘Am Yisrael Chai’ and prayed for the safety of the soldiers and hostages. Even with a siren blaring in the background, we kept our spirits high.' Yarden, the groom, added: 'We always worried something might go wrong today. Getting married in times like these is crazy. But like my wise bride said — God is watching over us.' After a 10-minute wait following the siren, the couple proceeded to their wedding venue. Just before stepping under the chuppah, they reflected: 'Here we are now, incredibly excited. The siren is behind us, and tonight, we celebrate. Thanks to the photographers for capturing such a classic moment that shows an Israeli couple getting married under the shadow of a war.'

President-elect Donald Trump moved to build out his foreign policy team Tuesday, announcing he is nominating Fox News host and Army veteran Pete Hegseth as his defense secretary, and former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe to lead the Central Intelligence Agency. Hegseth, 44, is a co-host of Fox News Channe 'Fox & Friends Weekend' and has been a contributor with the network since 2014, where he developed a friendship with Trump, who made regular appearances on the show. He is also the author of'The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.' Hegseth was an infantry captain in the Army National Guard and served overseas in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He was formerly head of the Concerned Veterans for America, a group backed by conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, and he unsuccessfully ran for the Senate in Minnesota in 2012. 'With Pete at the helm, America's enemies are on notice... Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down,' Trump said in a statement. 'Nobody fights harder for the Troops, and Pete will be a courageous and patriotic champion of our 'Peace through Strength' policy.' In a flurry of announcements, Trump said he had chosen former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as ambassador to Israel and his longtime friend Steven Witkoff to be a special envoy to the Middle East.

Biden administration wants to sanction Ben-Gvir before leaving Wh...	With two months left as US president, Biden aims to impose sanctions on the National Security Minister, hoping to create a domino effect of sanctions in countries around the world The U.S. State Department is contemplating imposing sanctions on National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir during the final stretch of President Joe Biden's tenure, according to sources familiar with the matter. These sanctions aim to balance the backlash stemming from the administration's decision not to impose an arms embargo on Israel, following an ultimatum letter. On Tuesday evening, the U.S. declared that Israel is not in violation of U.S. law on humanitarian aid to Gaza. State Department officials are urging Secretary of State Antony Blinken to endorse the sanctions against Ben-Gvir – a move unprecedented in the annals of U.S.-Israel relations, which would mark the first time that the U.S. would impose sanctions on a sitting government minister. The U.S. has already sanctioned several organizations and individuals in the West Bank, alleging that they are involved in violence against Palestinians. The Americans anticipate that a Trump administration would likely rescind the sanctions immediately upon taking office on January 20. However, they are banking on a 'domino effect,' in which a slew of countries and entities, including the European Union, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, would follow suit and levy sanctions against Ben-Gvir. Thus, even if Trump were to annul the sanctions, they would probably remain intact in other parts of the world. The sanctions envisioned by the State Department would bar Ben-Gvir from visiting the U.S. and prevent American entities from transferring funds to him. In recent months, the U.S. has also weighed sanctions against Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. Still, it is believed the administration will refrain from doing so, understanding that Smotrich might retaliate by not renewing Israeli banks' permission to engage with Palestinian banks in the West Bank, potentially leading to the Palestinian Authority's economic collapse. Recently, Smotrich extended this permission for just one month. Globally, Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, who hold relatively senior government positions, are effectively boycotted. Beyond the U.S., senior European officials also avoid engaging with them in any professional capacity. Last month, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that London is considering sanctions on Smotrich and Ben-Gvir due to some of their statements about Gazan civilians, which he labeled as 'abhorrent.' As of yet, the UK has not declared sanctions against them, despite their remarks concerning Gaza Strip residents amid the ongoing conflict. The National Security Minister sparked international outrage by calling for the cessation of humanitarian aid and fuel transfers to Gaza until all hostages are returned and also for advocating for 'encouraging migration and conquering the Gaza Strip territories to hold them permanently.' Smotrich, for his part, stated at an August conference that Israel provides aid to the Gaza Strip 'because there is no choice' and suggested it 'might be moral to starve two million Gazans.' His remarks ignited a global uproar, echoed by international media and shared widely across various platforms by network influencers. In addition to potentially sanctioning Ben-Gvir, the U.S. issued a warning Tuesday evening that legislation against UNRWA could lead to 'consequences,' as stated by the Deputy State Department spokesperson. 'There are still two months before the legislation takes effect, and we continue to discuss this with the Israeli government, clarifying that steps preventing essential aid to citizens could have legal and policy repercussions,' said Vedant Patel. Addressing the decision not to impose an arms embargo on Israel, he noted: 'We will continue monitoring Israel's actions and evaluate if they comply with American law. Should we find any non-compliance, we will take appropriate measures.'

US judge blocks Louisiana from requiring Ten Commandments in clas...	A federal judge on Tuesday declared unconstitutional a Louisiana law requiring that the Ten Commandments be displayed in all public school classrooms in the state. The decision by U.S. District Judge John deGravelles, who called the law 'discriminatory and coercive,' is a temporary setback for conservative groups trying to make expressions of faith more prominent in society. Louisiana schools would have been required to comply with the state law by Jan. 1. Liz Murrill, the state's Republican attorney general, said in a statement: 'We strongly disagree with the court's decision and will immediately appeal.' An appeal would go to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, widely considered among the most conservative federal appeals courts. DeGravelles said Louisiana's law conflicted with a 1980 U.S. Supreme Court decision voiding a similar law in Kentucky, and violated the religious rights of people who opposed the displays. Louisiana became the only U.S. state requiring displays of the Ten Commandments when Republican Governor Jeff Landry signed the law on June 19. The law requires the display of posters or framed versions of the Ten Commandments that are at least 11 inches by 14 inches. Nine families, including several clergy, with children in public schools sued five days later in Baton Rouge, Louisiana's capital, seeking an injunction against the law.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjwxmrwmjl	2024-11-12T12:08:19-08:00	
Iran, Russia link bank card systems in latest move to overcome sa...	Iranian bank cards are now operational in Russia, following the integration of Iran's Shetab network with Russia's Mir; This collaboration aims to mitigate impact of sanctions, with plans to expand the system to other nations with strong Iranian ties Iranian bank cards can now be used in Russia, state television reported, as the two countries linked their banking systems in the latest bid to counteract sanctions. Iranian banks have been excluded since 2018 from the SWIFT international financial messaging service, which governs the vast majority of transactions worldwide. The move is part of a raft of sanctions that were re-imposed on Iran after the United States withdrew from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal. Iranian bank cards can now be used in Russia, state television channel IRINN said on Monday, showing the withdrawal of money using an Iranian bank card from an ATM in Russia. The operation was made possible by connecting Iran's interbank network Shetab to its Russian equivalent Mir, the channel said. Iranians can currently withdraw money in Russia, and will in the future be able to use their cards to pay for in-store purchases, it added. 'The plan is also going to be implemented in other countries that have a wide range of financial and social interactions with Iran, for example Iraq, Afghanistan and Turkey,' it said. Both Iran and Russia have sought to counteract the effects of sanctions on their economies. Since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has faced mounting sanctions, and its ties with Tehran have grown closer in parallel. Ukraine and its Western allies have since the start of the conflict accused Iran of supplying Russia with both drones and missiles for use in the war. Tehran and Moscow signed an agreement in June to strengthen their cooperation in the banking sector. In the future, Russians will also be able to use their bank cards in Iran, IRINN said, without specifying when. Russia has been pushing for the creation of an international payment platform as an alternative to the SWIFT service, from which key Russian banks have also been excluded since 2022.

Herzog says Gaza hostages are top priority in White House meeting...	President Isaac Herzog thanked Biden for his support for Israel and the Jewish people, and says that Israel is working for the 'day after' in Gaza; He also asserted that Iran can't achieve a nuclear weapon and fulfill it's intention to annihilate Israel President Isaac Herzog met with U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House on Tuesday, expressing gratitude for Biden's ongoing support of Israel during his presidency. Herzog acknowledged Biden’s efforts toward securing the release of hostages and emphasized that while Israel is working to ensure a stable 'day after' in the Gaza Strip, the return of the hostages remains the top priority. President Biden concurred. Herzog was welcomed to the White House by U.S. Chief of Protocol Eitan Weiss and signed the official guest book in the Roosevelt Room. At the start of their meeting, which took place amid a deadlock in hostage negotiations and efforts to reach an agreement in Lebanon, Biden told Herzog, 'You're a long time a personal friend. And, you know that my commitment to Israel is ironclad, and we share a deep friendship.' 'We are fighting hard. We are defending our people with our brave soldiers and pilots. I know you are working very hard to make sure this war ends and for first and foremost the security for the people of Israel as well as for the people of Lebanon. ,' Herzog said. 'In Gaza, we have 101 hostages over 400 days,' Herzog continued, 'I know, Mr. President, that you're day in, day out, actively seeking their safe return home as they're going through hell in the dungeons of Gaza. Clearly, you're thinking and working about the day after as well, which perhaps should be a trajectory of hope to the people of the region and the ability have our neighbors as well as ours security. But first we need to get our hostages back.' Biden responded, 'I agree.' 'It all starts in Tehran. It all starts in the empire of evil, where Tehran with its proxies, they're doing whatever they can to erase stability and security and peace, calling for the annihilation of the State of Israel and seeking nuclear weapons. Mr. President, this has to be a major objective - all throughout your term and the next term and the next president - because we have to make sure that they cannot fulfill their evil intentions. They're also a major engine of antisemitism, Mr. President, and I know how much you put a focus on fighting and combating, antisemitism.'

This is the next US ambassador to Israel: Mike Huckabee says Isra...	Former Arkansas governor will replace Biden appointee Jack Lew; The evangelical Christian minister ran in the Republican presidential primaries twice, is considered a strong supporter of Israel and the settlements, and has said that he considered buying a house in the settlement of Efrat The next U.S. ambassador to Israel will be Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas who ran twice in the Republican presidential primaries for the presidency, Presidedt-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday. Huckabee will replace Jack Lew, who was appointed by President Joe Biden. Huckabee ran in the 2008 Republican primaries and lost to John McCain, and eight years later lost to Trump. Huckabee is identified with the evangelical Christian right in the United States, and defines himself as a great supporter of Israel. He is an evangelical minister by training, and served as a political commentator on the right-wing Fox News. In 2015, while running for the Republican Party's presidential nomination, Huckabee visited the ancient West Bank site of Shiloh, the site of the biblical tabernacle. 'Judea and Samaria are an inseparable part of the State of Israel and everyone needs to understand that. Anyone running for the presidency of the United States should visit here,' he said while at Shiloh, using the biblical designations for the West Bank. In an interview with Ynet at the time he said that 'Israel needs to control Judea and Samaria'. He said, among other things, that Jewish settlement is 'a factor leading to regional peace.' Huckabee, who is considered an ardent supporter of the annexation of the West Bank, has also said in the past that he is considering buying a house in the settlement of Efrat. Apart from his visit to Shiloh, he also prayed at Joseph's Tomb in Nablus and has rejected the two-state solution. 'What has been built here is a bridge to peace,' he said when he visited Efrat in the Etzion bloc in 2018, while emphasizing the economic partnership with Palestinian workers who, according to him, receive improved wages and conditions compared to in the Palestinian Authority. Huckabee called for continued construction in the area, as opposed to freezes that were customary during the Obama administration. The choice of Huckabee is also interesting because it was thought that if Trump did not appoint David Friedman as Secretary of State, he might ask him to return to serve as ambassador to Israel. In the end, Marco Rubio has been appointed Secretary of State; Rubio also was defeated by Trump in the Republican primaries in 2016. Huckabee is also considered a vocal critic of singer Beyoncé, claiming that her content and shows are not suitable for children. He criticized her cultural influence, especially on young people, and called her conduct 'too provocative.' Huckabee even addressed Beyoncé's relationship with her husband, the rapper Jay-Z, and claimed that he sometimes presents her in a disrespectful way. His positions received widespread reactions in the media, and some have seen them as part of the conservative trends and religious values ​​that guide him, while others have accused him of an unnecessary entry into the popular cultural discourse.

Kissufim crossing opens to deliver aid to Gaza, angering kibbutz ...	The Israeli government's decision to open another crossing for humanitarian aid to Gaza, under orders from the U.S. , has sparked outrage among local residents, who cite unresolved trauma and security concerns; 'Through the crossing, dozens of Israelis were kidnapped,' they write in letter to Biden The Israeli government has announced the start of humanitarian aid deliveries via the reopened Kissufim Crossing, a move driven by directives from the political leadership and aimed at bolstering the flow and routes of aid into the Gaza Strip. This initiative, which began on Tuesday, involves the dispatch of humanitarian aid trucks carrying essentials such as food, water, medical supplies and shelter materials to central and southern Gaza. The decision has sparked outrage among the residents of Kibbutz Kissufim, who have expressed their anger in a letter to President Joe Biden, describing their feelings as a 'personal and national trauma.' This development comes amid significant American pressure and the looming threat of a U.S. arms embargo unless humanitarian aid deliveries increase, though the latter has subsided following the election of Donald Trump. The crossing's opening was coordinated with Israeli forces through the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Southern Command, and the Land Crossings Authority within the Ministry of Defense. The aid was permitted entry into Gaza following security inspections at the Kerem Shalom crossing. In their letter to President Biden, members of Kibbutz Kissufim emphasized: 'The place called 'Kissufim Crossing' is the point from which hundreds of Hamas terrorists and Gazan civilians crossed on October 7 with the intention to murder, rape and burn the surrounding kibbutzim - including Kissufim.' They expressed gratitude to the U.S. president for his support of Israel but noted that they were informed about the crossing's reopening, reportedly at his request, through media reports. 'Through this crossing, dozens of Israelis were kidnapped, including 87-year-old Shlomo Mansour, who is still captive,' they said. 'The opening of the crossing fuels our personal and national trauma. It is unacceptable. We expect the 101 hostages to return through this crossing - soon. You know how deep our pain is.' Mansour’s daughter, Moshit, addressed the proximity of the Kissufim Crossing to the kibbutz, highlighting the continued absence of the hostages for 403 days and criticizing Israel's prioritization of humanitarian aid to Gaza over the security and well-being of its own citizens. 'The hostages have not returned, bringing Gaza residents closer to the Kissufim border fence, and continue to abandon the lives of the soldiers in the fighting without clear targets,' she said. The situation escalated when the IDF reported the discovery of ammunition within a humanitarian aid convoy in Gaza for the first time. During a coordinated international convoy monitored by military forces, suspicion arose of unusual movement, prompting a security inspection at the humanitarian corridor between the north and south of the strip. Israeli forces found a bag containing ammunition for firearms. The military detailed that those involved, along with convoy members, were detained for field investigation by Unit 504, with further handling by IDF and security forces. This incident surfaces as the Israeli cabinet deliberates on expanding aid to Gazans, a decision already being implemented by the military with dozens of daily truck deliveries. The policy shift comes under intense American pressure, despite concerns the aid might be seized by Hamas. According to a report by The Guardian, the volume of aid entering Gaza has plummeted to its lowest level since December 2023, amid U.S. arms embargo threats. COGAT's data prompted the cabinet to address the issue in a recent discussion, resulting in the decision to expand aid, although visits to Gazan detainees remain prohibited. Officials in Jerusalem hope that upcoming diplomatic engagements in Washington will alleviate the threat. Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, closely associated with Prime Minister Netanyahu, is slated to meet with senior U.S. officials and President-elect Donald Trump, while President Isaac Herzog will confer with outgoing President Joe Biden. The American ultimatum, demanding Israeli compliance within 30 days, was issued on October 13 and is nearing its deadline. It remains uncertain what measures, if any, the U.S. administration will adopt against Israel should it fail to meet Washington's demands.

The heavy toll of continued fighting in Jabaliya - 24 soldiers ki...	Jabaliya in northern Gaza remains a tough stronghold to crack, as more than 200 explosives-rigged buildings were uncovered in 6 weeks of intensive combat, and according to IDF estimations the operation will last at least several more weeks Fighting in Jabaliya has entered its second month and is continuing to take a heavy toll. Five soldiers were killed there within a single day in two separate incidents, bringing the death toll among Israeli troops fighting there to 24 since the operation in Jabaliya began just six weeks ago. Despite two previous IDF raids on the city in the past year — one in December and another in May and June — Jabaliya remains a focus of intensive combat. During operations by the Kfir Brigade in the area, troops located and destroyed rocket launchers aimed at Israeli communities along the Gaza border. Additionally, IDF forces uncovered Hamas uniforms, military equipment, AK-47 rifles, and weapons components. The Kfir Brigade has neutralized around 50 terrorists in close-quarters combat and airstrikes and dismantled dozens of terrorist infrastructures. Lt. Col. Yoel, commander of the Shimshon Battalion, commented near a discovered rocket launcher: 'Right here beside me is a launch site. This is where Hamas launches rockets at Israel's Gaza border communities. We will reach any location the enemy uses to set up launch facilities or anything targeting Israeli civilians. We will find it, destroy it, and eliminate the threat.' Israeli forces are continuing to fortify a new cross-beam axis around the northern third of Gaza. This route cuts between Gaza City and Jabaliya to its north, enhancing control over the area. The combat patterns have remained largely unchanged in the sixth week of the raid: Forces sweep Hamas strongholds, primarily within Jabaliya's refugee camp, and apply pressure on two nearby towns, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia, encouraging any remaining civilians to move southward toward Gaza City – and ideally beyond the Nitzarim area to the southern part of Gaza. IDF forces are discovering weapons caches daily and engaging with terrorists regularly. The primary threat remains IEDs: Hamas has rigged more than 200 buildings in Jabaliya, primarily with 'dumb' explosives using improvised tripwires but without surveillance cameras. The IDF estimates this operation will be more prolonged than previous ones, potentially lasting several more weeks. Three IDF brigades under the 162nd Division are participating in the raid. The IDF has identified Jabaliya as a core Hamas stronghold in northern Gaza, where hundreds of terrorists — including senior commanders — have converged. Despite the IDF managing to evacuate tens of thousands of residents from the city over the past month, breaking what the IDF describes as a 'fear barrier' imposed by Hamas, a few thousand civilians remain.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Jewish leaders via v...	At the General Assembly of the Jewish Federations of North America event meant to promote Jewish unity and provide a gathering space for leaders in the Jewish communities of North America, Israeli cabinet ministers are notably absent Leaders from the North American Jewish community took over the halls of the Marriott Marquis in Washington, DC on Monday and Tuesday for the General Assembly of the Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA). Over 2,000 Jewish communal leaders and philanthropists from all over the U.S. and Canada were present in addition to a handful of guests from around the globe. Yet as the crowd gathered, a notable absence cast a shadow: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was nowhere to be seen, nor was any one of his 37 cabinet ministers. The Israeli daily Haaretz claims that Netanyahu was not been invited to this year’s General Assembly for the first time in his many years as prime minister. A JFNA spokesperson refuted the report, however, saying that the prime minister was indeed invited. Given Israel’s seven-front war and logistical challenges, he chose to deliver a video address, as he has done many times before, according to the spokesperson. The address was to be played during a plenary on Tuesday morning in Washington DC. The Prime Minister’s Office declined to comment. There may have been a strategic choice by JFNA to focus on unity rather than Israeli politics, General Assembly participants suggested. JFNA’s intent to focus on unity may be a response to the ongoing war on Israel's southern and northern borders and the surge of antisemitism affecting both American college campuses and the Jewish community at large. On the eve of the unity rally that launched the assembly, the only kosher restaurant in the nation’s capital was vandalized, with two of its windows smashed. The Jewish Federation of Greater Washington called the incident 'deeply disturbing' in a Sunday morning statement and urged a full investigation. William Daroff, CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, said that many Israeli ministers chose to stay in Israel given the ongoing war. He also noted that the event is more focused on connections between Jewish communities than on connections between the Israeli and American governments. 'I know that a number of Israeli ministers want to stay close to home given the war,' Daroff said. 'The focus [of the GA] is on the people of Israel and not the government,' he added. 'We are more than just government-to-government; it is people-to-people. At the end of the day, this [event] is about the American Jewish community connecting with the Israeli Jewish community.' 'The government, political piece can be divisive,' Daroff concluded. 'If the focus here is not politics and government but rather how people can be unified – must be unified – then the content should follow.' The relationship between American Jewry and the Israeli government has been strained since the current Israeli administration took office in December 2022. The October 7 massacre boosted Jewish unity, and JFNA raised substantial funds to support Israel in the wake of the attacks. JFNA said in August that it had raised $854 million for Israel since October 7, 2023, much of which was allocated directly to local nonprofits. Around $75 million of the funds were dedicated to northern Israel, where constant rocket fire from Hezbollah has displaced over 60,000 people from their homes. Increased solidarity with Israel following October 7 notwithstanding, many American Jews have voiced opposition to the current Israeli government. American Jews tend to be left-leaning and supportive of figures like Vice President Kamala Harris, who received nearly 80% of the Jewish vote. Survey data released last week by the left-leaning Zionist organization J Street showed that 66% of American Jews favor sanctioning far-right Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich for allegedly supporting violent settler attacks on Palestinians. The survey also highlighted a sharp decline in Netanyahu’s popularity among American Jews, with just 32% viewing him favorably and 63% viewing him unfavorably. Data from an October survey by the Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI) reveal further strain in the relationship between U.S. Jews and Israel. Politically conservative Jews feel nearly as connected to Israel as they did when the war began, the JPPI study found, but left-leaning Jews are increasingly disconnected. About 38% of 'strong liberals' reported feeling more distant from Israel due to the war, up from 29% of the same group in July. The JPPI study also noted decreasing support for the Israeli military among the most liberal respondents. 69% of the most liberal group said in October that Israel’s actions were excessively aggressive; in January, only 51% of the group said the same. A different JPPI study, released a week before the election, showed that 95% of the Jewish Americans supporting Donald Trump cited Israel as a key factor in casting their vote. In contrast, Israel was cited as a key factor for only 31% of strong Harris supporters. Despite the tensions between American Jews and the Israeli government, participants at the JFNA GA generally refrained from openly criticizing the Israeli government. Few voiced disappointment at the lack of Israeli government officials physically present. Jess Dolgin, CEO of J Media Global, said it was not the first time Netanyahu sent a video instead of attending personally, 'but it’s the first time Israel is facing seven fronts, and his time is probably better spent managing that,' he said. Meredith Jacobs, CEO of Jewish Women International, pointed out that representatives from the Israeli Embassy in Washington spoke at the event, as did several Israeli speakers, including hostage family members and nonprofit leaders. 'Israel has enough work to do right now, and I am happy if they are in Israel doing their work,' JWI Chief Program Officer Deborah Rosenbloom said of Israeli government officials. 'The GA is about the leadership of the American Jewish community. It just feels like there are other opportunities [to host Israeli ministers]. I don’t feel like it’s missed.' President Isaac Herzog attended the event and spoke Monday afternoon, praising attendees for mobilizing for Israel 'like a family.' He noted that American Jews had traveled to Israel to volunteer and to comfort mourners. 'You chose to demonstrate solidarity, to bear witness, to fight,' he told the crowd. 'You chose to show up for us when we needed you the most. The warmth and the affection expressed by world Jewry gave Israelis a lifeline and motivation to persevere. This was our finest hour – and your finest hour.' -This article is written by Maayan Hoffman and reprinted with permission from The Media Line Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bkgznwbfjg	2024-11-12T09:08:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/11/12/BJkewbbzJl/BJkewbbzJl_0_227_750_423_0_small.jpg

Herzog also thanked Biden for his support for Israel: 'We will never forget, ever, in history how you stood up with us in our darkest hour, which became our finest hour, how you came to Israel a few days after the barbaric attack of October 7th, how you helped us and supported us with words and deeds.' Herzog also called for the return of the hostages from Gaza. Biden replied: 'I agree.

At a dance party with Beyonce': Donald Trump's brand strategy fo...	There’s no other way to put it - Trump is a marketing genius and his brand strategy is an impressive mix of innovation and entertainment; Trump deeply understands how to market his brand in the new media age, This is Trump's brand strategy that brought him his victory Trump 2024: A well-oiled trend machine on TikTok Trump’s activity on TikTok is nothing less than a model of marketing mastery, as he simply knows how it works. He uses content shared by his supporters and even his opponents, who create catchy 'sounds' that fit the viral nature of the platform. With his unique talent, Trump has crafted sounds that people use humorously, reinforcing his image as one of the people with a sharp, clear political message. Trump has created endless sounds and trends on TikTok. Sounds like 'Joe Biden is asleep, and Kamala is at a dance party with Beyonce' captures his views on Biden and Harris's governance in the Middle East, or his dance trend to the song 'YMCA' by the Village People makes his brand visible everywhere, to every age, and in every language. Trump embraces a bold approach that allows him to be 'authentic' – a valuable asset in the social media era. In contrast to Kamala Harris, who comes across as robotic, reading from a teleprompter and struggling in interviews (maybe due to Trump’s portrayal?), Trump shoots from the hip and doesn’t need talking points. This builds a more reliable image against his competitors. The people's media vs traditional press Donald Trump understood long ago that to reach his supporters directly and achieve virality, there’s no point in relying on established media outlets, many of which criticize him. He’s also aware of his weaknesses, adapting messages for each platform accordingly. Instead, he turns to social media and more 'popular' platforms, allowing him to deliver unfiltered messages without traditional media filters and commentary. A notable example is Trump’s use of TikTok, appealing to young audiences. Moreover, in the current race, Trump chose to appear on popular podcasts like 'The Joe Rogan Experience,' where he can speak freely. These podcasts are perceived by the public as more authentic and accessible and reach audiences who sometimes don’t watch TV at all. Additionally, he uses the X social media platform. With Elon Musk’s statement that he sees Twitter as a free speech platform, Trump’s provocative content has an even greater reach. Trump’s 'what is not said' marketing technique Trump talks like a teenager, uses cynical and biting language, and even weaves in (subtle but deliberate) online conspiracies. If you are not familiar with the allegedly serious sex scandal involving P. Diddy, which allegedly took place at the parties he hosted, or the conspiracies linking him to celebrities like Beyoncé and Jennifer Lopez, then you're missing out on what's happening on TikTok. This marketing tactic is quite genius, like a gift from heaven to Trump. How is it that people associated with P. Diddy, who has been accused of gross misconduct, are the ones supporting Kamala? In a brilliant move, Trump encapsulated this scandal and the online conspiracies involving celebrities at P. Diddy’s parties with a single line that says it all: 'Kamala is at a dance party with Beyonce.' A good marketer knows that even what isn’t said can support your brand.

US company offers cruise for Trump's entire term in office	Villa Vie Residences puts a 4-year cruise on offer starting at $255,999 per person, visiting over 100 countries across seven continents A U.S. cruise company is offering Americans a voyage of up to four years – set to continue until after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s term in office ends. The company, Villa Vie Residences, offers customers all-inclusive tickets for $255,999 per cabin, with a double-occupancy cabin starting at $319,998. The cruise will visit 140 countries across seven continents, according to a report by Business Insider. Villa Vie Residences also offers a 'midterm choice' package – a two-year voyage priced at $150,399 for a single passenger or $187,998 for a couple. One-, two- and three-year ticket options are also available on the Odyssey, a ship that sails continuously. The ship is equipped with spa facilities and fitness programs and the tickets include meals – with free beer and wine served during lunch and dinner. Business Insider reported prior to the U.S. election that millions of Americans were considering leaving the country if Trump were re-elected. As election results began to come in, online searches for 'moving to Canada' spiked. While the Odyssey cruise doesn’t offer 'true' citizenship or immigration, it gives passengers an option to 'escape the traffic, politics and daily urban routine.' The Odyssey embarked on its maiden voyage in September after being docked in Belfast, Ireland, for four months due to delays. It was previously reported that two passengers who repeatedly complained about the delays were removed from the ship and their contracts were canceled.

Even though he was fired, Gallant's draft orders for Haredim will...	Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was fired, but the IDF is going ahead with issuing 7,000 additional draft orders to ultra-Orthodox Israeli young men, sparking controversy and protest; Only a fraction have reported for duty, highlighting tensions within Israeli society over conscription policies Former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was dismissed a week ago, but the conscription orders he planned to issue to thousands of Haredim will go on as planned, the IDF maintains. The military announced on Tuesday that, starting from Sunday, an additional 7,000 draft notices will be sent to ultra-Orthodox Jews. 'We are continuing with this process as planned. The Haredi recruitment administration is not shutting down, and all recruitment initiatives for the Haredim are under review,' according to the IDF. The IDF emphasized that the issuance of these orders has already received approval and complies with legal standard. 'We have not received any other directive,' according to the military. Last week, soon after the announcement regarding Haredi conscription, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and appointed Israel Katz as his successor. Among the 3,000 orders issued in the initial phase, only 240 young Haredi men reported to recruitment offices. Approximately 800 received warnings of impending arrest for failing to attend the initial draft process, despite multiple notifications. The 3,000 notices were sent out in three waves, each consisting of 1,000 orders: 50% targeted those age 18-21, 40% targeted the 22-23 age group, and 10% were aimed at those age 24-25. Some 15% of these are married. Of those notified, less than a tenth, or around 240, have responded, with some having already completed the enlistment process. The IDF currently estimates a deficit of approximately 10,000 active-duty soldiers needed to meet force-building requirements. This shortfall implies a need for personnel who can both strengthen existing forces and participate in future strategic plans. The scale of forces allocated to combat sectors is expected to be significantly larger than it was before October 7, 2023, necessitating substantial manpower. Meanwhile, Haredi political parties are advocating for any draft exemption law passed with their consent to annul previously issued conscription orders to young Haredim, sent without their coordination. They also plan to seek clemency for those who have faced sanctions or threats of arrest. Within extreme Haredi factions, protests are intensifying against efforts to expand the draft. Recently, a 'Black Flag' center was established, disseminating voice messages via kosher phones with updates on the arrival of draft enforcers in Haredi communities, and preparations for protests against them. Plans for mass rallies in support of halting the continued dispatch of draft notices are underway. A senior figure within the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party criticized the situation. 'The sending of orders by the army is directly attributed to the Likud Party and its leader. They had the opportunity to prevent the move but chose to ignore it. Moreover, Likud did not pass the draft law they committed to, opposed the day care law aimed at helping poor families, and now they are even deliberately acting against yeshiva students. All these prove that the promises made to the Haredi public remain unfulfilled.'

Kibbutz Nir Oz opts to rebuild 400 days after October 7 massacre	Residents, a quarter of which were either murdered or kidnapped during the Hamas atrocities say the chose to rebuild their community; Netanyahu has not visited since the massacre, Smotrich expected to visit on Tuesday After more than 400 days since the Hamas massacre on October 7 last year, residents of Kibbutz Nir Oz voted to rebuild their community. 'Out of the unimaginable pain of what we have gone through and are still going through, and while calling on the government to immediately return all the hostages as a necessary and basic condition for our revival,' they wrote in a document published on Monday. Nir Oz members said that victory for them means the return of the hostages and the reconstruction of the kibbutz. 'It is clear to us that the only victory alongside the return of our loved ones is the re-establishment of Kibbutz Nir Oz. Stronger, better, and bigger. The members of Nir Oz decided: Kibbutz Nir Oz will be rebuilt.' They said in rebuilding, Israel's resilience and ability to rise again will be tested. 'Therefore, the government must ensure a complete and optimal construction of the kibbutz, while showing generosity and a sincere desire to bring about the revival of Nir Oz. Along with the re-establishment, it is our duty to preserve the memory and heritage, and to perpetuate the stories of heroism in Kibbutz Nir Oz to ensure the memory of the place and its people for generations.' The members said that there may be those who would not be able to return because of their personal loss and trauma. 'These people are our people and are an essential part of the community. We demand that the govedrnment find solutions for those who cannot return while rebuilding the community. Our door will remain open for them to return To Nir Oz in the future if they wish. We are committed to the struggle for the liberation of our friends, along with the duty to return home and start over.' Most of the members of Nir Oz currently live in Kiryat Gat a city in the south. After October 7, Nir Oz became one of the symbols of the government's abandonment when the kibbutz was occupied by hundreds of terrorists, who slaughtered the residents without hindrance. When the IDF forces arrived at the kibbutz in the afternoon, there was no one left to save. Not a single IDF bullet was fired in Nir Oz, which was completely abandoned. The results are tragic and unimaginable: 57 murdered, of which at least 7 were kidnapped from their home alive and murdered in captivity. ⁠20 living hostages and 9 killed soldiers whose bodies are still held by Hamas. 76 were kidnapped that morning, of which 40 women and children were exchanged in the hostage deal almost a year ago. Seven bodies of the fallen soldiers were returned to Israel as part of military rescue operations. As part of Nir Oz's restoration efforts, last week the chairman of the Takuma Directorate (council responsible for rebuilding the destroyed towns due to the war) and CEO of the Prime Minister's Office, Yossi Shelley, toured the kibbutz and met with the residents. 'There was a discussion together with the community leaders, the council representatives, and the residents' representatives who presented their needs and the rehabilitation plan, which they will soon approve,' said the Takuma Directorate. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich is expected to visit the kibbutz on Tuesday, 402 days after the massacre.

Mossad confirms concrete intel of plot to attack Israelis in Ko P...	Thai police bolsters forces in island amid reports of planned attack during full moon party, a favorite of visiting Israelis; security council issues travel warning, calls to avoid Israeli markings and crowded gatherings throughout Thailand Mossad confirmed on Tuesday that there was an immediate and credible threat of a plot to attack Israelis during the full moon party at Ko Pha Ngan on Friday. Ynet learned earlier that Thailand police warned in an internal brief, of the planned attack on Israeli tourists on the island. Thai police increased their activity on the island and set up roadblocks. Officials involved in the matter said that there is concrete information of the plan to target the estimated tens of thousands of Israeli visitors. An Israeli security official, said the matter is familiar to authorities here and they are in contact with their counterparts in Thailand. He also said a travel warning will be issued by the National Security Council in the near future. Ko Pha Ngan is known not only for its beautiful beaches but also for its full moon parties that carry on through the night. 'From my experience, Israelis are rattled easily,' said Erez Rot, a travel agent based in Ko Samui, another thai island. 'But maybe this year, certainly after the attacks in Amsterdam, Israelis should avoid crowded gatherings.' He said that since the outbreak of war, tourism in Thailand had taken a hit and fewer Israelis travel there. Concerns of an attack come weeks after a specific warning was issued to Israelis visiting Sri Lanka, who were told to leave the Arugam Bay area because a hit squad was believed to be in the area. Three suspects were later arrested and according to court filings in the U.S., Iran was behind a plot to target the Israelis there.

Iran builds 'defensive tunnel' in capital after Israeli strikes	Tunnel located near Tehran center will link a station on the metro line to the Imam Khomeini hospital, allowing underground access Iran is building a 'defensive tunnel' in the capital Tehran, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on Tuesday, following strikes by Israel on targets in the country. The tunnel, located near the city center, will link a station on the Tehran metro to the Imam Khomeini hospital, thus allowing direct underground access to the medical facility. 'For the first time in the country, a tunnel with defensive applications is being built in Tehran,' the head of transport for Tehran City Council told Tasnim. Last month, Israel carried out its first officially-recognized strikes in Iran, hitting missile factories and other sites near Tehran and in the country's west, as a response to Iran's October 1 attack on Israeli territory. Back in October, Iran launched nearly 200 missiles at Israel, most of which were intercepted, though some landed in central and southern Israel. Israeli officials vowed a severe response to the large-scale attack, while Iran continued issuing threats. A video was released showing Revolutionary Guard Commander Hossein Salami ordering the operation, dubbed 'Operation True Promise 2,' following a similar attack in April of the same name.

Israel seizes millions from PA after Nova victims appeal to court	Victims' families claim the Palestinian Authority's funding of terrorist actions directly harmed them and their loved ones on October 7 while seeking compensation The Jerusalem District Court on Monday granted the request of 11 families of victims of the Nova Music Festival massacre executed by Hamas on October 7, issuing a temporary attachment order of up to NIS 169 million ($42.8 million) against the Palestinian Authority (PA). This means that should the families win their lawsuit against the PA for NIS 334 million ($84.7 million), the amount would be allocated for their compensation. The appeal, filed by attorneys Tzvi A. Shamir and Gilead Sher, argued that the victims named in the lawsuit were among those attending the Nova festival and were murdered by terrorists. It included a victim who was present at Nova and was injured. The attachment request claimed, 'The Palestinian Authority, which has transferred and continues to transfer funds as rewards and compensation to terrorists and their families under PA legislation, thereby supports the terror acts committed by the terrorists in the massacre. Hence, the PA bears liability for damages to terror victims and their families.' The request further argued that Israel’s law for compensating terror victims provides the petitioners with a solid basis for a claim against the PA and allows for a direct civil lawsuit against any entity involved in a terror act. The law allows exemplary compensation of NIS 10 million ($2.5 million) to the families of those killed in terror attacks and NIS 5 million ($1.25 million) to those left disabled, in addition to compensation for damages and other stipends. The request also added that, according to the Compensation of Victims of Terrorism Bill, a 'terror-supporting body' is defined as any entity that transfers funds due to a terror attack for the benefit of the perpetrator or on their behalf. Last September, the Jerusalem District Court issued an attachment order of NIS 160 million ($40.6 million) on funds designated for the Palestinian Authority at the appeal of dozens of other bereaved families, including families who lost loved ones in the past year, represented by attorneys Barak Kedem and Arie Arbus. The families were those whose relatives were murdered in recent years’ attacks, including terrorist infiltrations, suicide bombings in major cities and the events of October 7, including the Nova festival massacre. The funds were seized under the 2018 Law on Freezing Revenues Designated for the Palestinian Authority which includes the Payments to Prisoners and Families of Terrorism Offenders clause. According to the 2018 law, Israel’s defense minister submits a report to the Security Cabinet at the end of each year detailing the total amount paid by the Palestinian Authority's Martyrs Fund to terrorists and their families in the previous year. The following year, an amount equal to 1/12 of the reported sum is frozen from the tax revenues Israel transfers to the PA each month. Currently, NIS 2 billion ($532 million) is frozen in the state's treasury due to this law. The court has now decided to seize money from the fund and allocate it to the plaintiffs who sued the Palestinian Authority.

Drone crashes on pre-school in Haifa Suburb, no injuries reported	Kindergarten staff rushes children into shelters as a practice when sirens in nearby areas warn of a threat; the kids were taken to safety before the UAV hit; 'the staff saved lives,' a grateful father says An attack drone launched by Hezbollah in Lebanon crashed into the yard of a preschool in the Haifa suburb of Nesher on Tuesday, while the children were inside. No one was hurt. No sirens were activated in the area of the preschool although the drone was observed crossing the border from Lebanon and was being chased by the IDF as warning sirens sounded along its way. The military said it was investigating why the Nesher sirens were not heard. A father of a 4.5-year-old girl attending the kindergarten praised the staff for its conduct after they rushed the kids into shelters on their own initiative and said their actions saved lives. 'Whenever there are sirens nearby the staff takes the children into the shelter. The teacher sent a message to the parents' group telling us the kids were fine with pictures of them in the shelter, even before the drone hit.' Repeated attempts to shoot down the drone, failed in the 14 minutes of flight as it approached the area of Haifa. Similar attacks have taken place in the recent days and the threat of drone strikes has become one of the more complex for aerial defenses. Drones are used by pro-Iran militias in Iraq and Syria and by the Houthi rebels in Yemen, as well as Hezbollah. According to the Air Force, some 1,300 attack drones were launched at Israel since the start of the war. 231 hit the ground. This means some 82% of the hostile UAVs have been successfully shot down. The IDF has been trying to target the Hezbollah's secretive 127 Unit responsible for launching attack drones areas from where the drones, even after its commander was assassinated in the attack on the Dahieh last September. Only 10% of the unit's force has been killed thus far, the military said adding that the terror group still retains some 30% of its drone arsenal after most was destroyed in IDF attacks on warehouses and launchers.

Iranians calls to 'turn the threat of Trump into a good opportuni...	While Khamenei is set on settling score with incoming president for his previous actions, many officials in Tehran say the country should use his tenure to alleviate sanctions and end wars in the region While many leaders in Iran’s Islamic Republic worry following U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House in 2025, other voices are starting to offer to avoid a confrontation with him and use his term as a diplomatic opportunity for the country. The New York Times reported on Monday some working for Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian — a reformist who pledged to improve relations with the West and lift sanctions severely impacting Iran's economy — support a reconciliatory approach toward Trump. For many in the regime, however, such rapprochement would be hard to accept, not only because Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal during his first term and reinstated sanctions, but also because he ordered the 2020 assassination of Iranian general and Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani. Five Iranian officials told the American outlet that supporters of a diplomatic approach hope it might be possible to reach a stable agreement with Trump that would remain set for an extended period. They noted the president-elect's preference for striking deals where his predecessors had failed and the immense influence he wields within the Republican Party, often viewed as more adversarial toward Iran than the Democratic Party. The five Iranian officials described Tehran's experience with U.S. President Joe Biden's administration as 'frustrating,' adding that the deadlock in talks with the Democratic administration led many in the regime to conclude that only a deal with a Republican administration could yield long-term results. Pezeshkian himself hinted at the possibility of future talks with the U.S. under Trump, saying last week that his country would not be 'short-sighted' in developing diplomatic relations with other nations. However, any move to advance such negotiations would first require approval from Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who harbors particular resentment toward Trump. Since Soleimani’s assassination, Iran has sought to exact revenge on Trump, and a plan to assassinate him during the election campaign was uncovered last week. Reza Salehi, a conservative analyst from Tehran who is close to the regime’s hardline faction according to the outlet, said that while negotiations with an incoming Trump administration would be 'politically challenging' for Pezeshkian's government, he believes Trump would 'benefit Iran compared to his predecessor.' Salehi cited Trump’s statements on ending wars worldwide: 'He is into making deals; he is into ending wars and against starting new ones.' Mohammad Ali Abtahi, a former vice to reformist president Mohammad Khatami also spoke to The New York Times, urging Iran to 'turn the threat of Trump into a good opportunity and start active diplomacy.' He added, 'Trump likes to take personal credit for resolving a crisis, and one of the main crises now is the one between Iran and America.' Various experts estimate that in future negotiations Trump would likely demand that Iran halt its arming and funding of militias and terrorist organizations fighting against Israel as part of a sanction relief deal. Khamenei has repeatedly said Tehran’s support for its proxies in the Middle East won’t cease, leaving the prospects of reaching an agreement uncertain. However, some in Iran are convinced the regime has little choice due to the dire economic situation. Rahman Ghahremanpour, an Iranian analyst who spoke with The New York Times, argued that Iran can’t afford another four years under sanctions, as inflation continues to soar and internal frustration among Iranians remains high. 'We do not want more sanctions and more instability. But at the same time, a comprehensive deal with Trump has to give us some wiggle room to save face domestically and justify it. That will be the big challenge,' he said. The five Iranian officials highlighted Trump’s statements about ending the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. They noted that his remarks — alongside Trump’s promise to end the war in Ukraine and implement a more isolationist 'America First' policy — appeal to the Iranian regime. Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s former foreign minister remembered as a key figure in negotiating the nuclear deal a decade ago and now serving as Pezeshkian’s vice for strategic affairs, expressed hope that Trump and his vice president JD Vance will 'stand against war as pledged, and will heed the clear lesson given by the American electorate to end wars and prevent new ones.'

Mateh Asher Regional Council head Moshe Davidovitch, who leads the Confrontation Line forum comprised of northern mayors, issued a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday calling on him not to reach agreements in Lebanon before all Hezbollah forces are moved back beyond the Litani River. 'You promised that we won’t be able to reach an agreement until Hezbollah is backed beyond the Litani River. We’ll only be able to return residents to their homes with their safety assured,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj6dkcgfyl	2024-11-11T23:19:30-08:00

Trump expected to tap US Senator Marco Rubio for secretary of sta...	Rubio advocates for a muscular foreign policy with respect to America's geopolitical foes, including China, Iran and Cuba; president elect also taps Mike Waltz for National Security Advisor; Donald Trump is expected to tap U.S. Senator Marco Rubio to be his secretary of state, sources said on Monday, putting the Florida-born politician on track to be the first Latino to serve as America's top diplomat once the Republican president-elect takes office in January. Rubio was arguably the most hawkish option on Trump's shortlist for secretary of state, and he has in past years advocated for a muscular foreign policy with respect to America's geopolitical foes, including China, Iran and Cuba. Over the last several years he has softened some of his stances to align more closely with Trump's views. The president-elect accuses past U.S. presidents of leading America into costly and futile wars and has pushed for a more restrained foreign policy. While the famously mercurial Trump could always change his mind at the last minute, he appeared to have settled on his pick as of Monday, according to the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. Representatives for Trump and Rubio did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The new administration will confront a world more volatile and dangerous than it was when Trump took office in 2017, with wars raging in Ukraine and the Middle East and China aligning itself more closely with U.S. foes Russia and Iran. The Ukraine crisis will be high on Rubio's agenda. Rubio, 53, has said in recent interviews that Ukraine needs to seek a negotiated settlement with Russia rather than focus on regaining all territory that Russia has taken in the last decade. He was also one of 15 Republican senators to vote against a $95 billion military aid package for Ukraine, passed in April. While Rubio was far from the most isolationist option, his likely selection nonetheless underlines a broad shift in Republican foreign policy views under Trump. Once the party of hawks who advocated military intervention and a muscular foreign policy, most of Trump's allies now preach restraint, particularly in Europe, where many Republicans complain U.S. allies are not paying their fair share on defense. 'I'm not on Russia's side — but unfortunately the reality of it is that the way the war in Ukraine is going to end is with a negotiated settlement,' Rubio told NBC in September. Rubio's selection holds domestic as well as international significance. Trump beat Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 election in part by winning over large numbers of Latinos, who had voted overwhelmingly for Democrats in previous election cycles but have become an increasingly diverse demographic in a political sense, with more and more Latinos voting Republican. By selecting Rubio for a key policy role, Trump may help consolidate electoral gains among Latinos and make clear that they have a place at the highest levels of his administration. If confirmed, Rubio will likely place a much greater importance on Latin America than any previous secretary of state, said Mauricio Claver-Carone, a Rubio ally, former president of the Inter-American Development Bank and a former National Security Council aide on Latin America in the first Trump administration. 'This is the time Latin America will most be on the map in the history of any U.S. presidency. It's historic. There's no other way to say it,' said Claver-Carone. China, Cuba hawk Rubio was one of three final contenders for Trump's vice-presidential pick. The president-elect ultimately chose U.S. Senator JD Vance of Ohio, a hard-right figure who is known for his isolationist foreign policy positions. Some of Trump's supporters will be skeptical of his decision to tap Rubio, who until recently held muscular foreign policy positions that contradict those of Trump. During Trump's 2017-2021 term, for instance, Rubio co-sponsored legislation that would make it harder for Trump to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, by requiring two thirds of the Senate to ratify withdrawal. Trump has railed for years against NATO member countries that failed to meet agreed military spending targets and warned during the campaign that he would not only refuse to defend nations 'delinquent' on funding but would also encourage Russia 'to do whatever the hell they want' to them. Rubio is a top China hawk in the Senate, and was sanctioned by Beijing in 2020 over his stance on Hong Kong following democracy protests. Most notably, Rubio called on the Treasury Department in 2019 to launch a national security review of popular Chinese social media app TikTok's acquisition of Musical.ly, prompting an investigation and troubled divestment order. As the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, he has also kept up the heat on the Biden administration, demanding it block all sales to Huawei earlier this year after the sanctioned Chinese tech company released a new laptop powered by an Intel AI processor chip. Rubio, whose grandfather fled Cuba in 1962, is also an outspoken opponent of normalizing relations with the Cuban government, a position Trump shares. The head of the House subcommittee overseeing Latin American affairs, he is also a frequent and fierce critic of Nicolas Maduro's government in Venezuela. Trump has picked Republican Representative Mike Waltz to be his national security adviser, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday, tapping a retired Army Green Beret who has been a leading critic of China. Waltz, a Trump loyalist who also served in the National Guard as a colonel, has criticized Chinese activity in the Asia-Pacific and has voiced the need for the United States to be ready for a potential conflict in the region. Waltz has a long history in Washington's political circles. He was a defense policy director for defense secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates and was elected to Congress in 2018. He is the chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee overseeing military logistics and also on the select committee on intelligence. Waltz is also on the Republicans' China Task Force and has argued the U.S. military is not as prepared as it needs to be if there is conflict in the Indo-Pacific region. On Ukraine, Waltz has said his views have evolved. After Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, he called for the Biden administration to provide more weapons to Kyiv to help them push back Russian forces. But during an event last month, Waltz said there had to be a reassessment of the United States' aims in Ukraine. 'Is it in America's interest, are we going to put in the time, the treasure, the resources that we need in the Pacific right now badly?' Waltz asked. Waltz has praised Trump for pushing NATO allies to spend more on defense, but unlike the president-elect has not suggested the United States pull out of the alliance. 'Look we can be allies and friends and have tough conversations,' Waltz said last month.

The soldiers fell as troops were fighting Hamas terrorists in Jabaliya where fighting is expected to continue. The military said the forces were confronting Hamas's hard corps fighters in northern Gaza where hundreds of senior commanders of the terror group gathered despite repeated IDF operations in the area. Despite many civilians fleeing Jabaliya after they were able to overcome fear of Hamas and at the urging of the IDF, there are still thousands who remain, the military said.

Did Israel accomplish its goals in Lebanon?	ILTV News speaks with Colonel (ret.) Dr. Jacques Neriah about the prospect of a ceasefire with Lebanon Israel is considering signing a ceasefire agreement with Lebanon even before President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. But has Israel accomplished its goals in the country? According to Colonel (ret.) Dr. Jacques Neriah, 'if we are talking about the 80,000 Israelis that have to come back to their homes [in the North], well, this is far from being realistic or concrete in any way.' Neriah, a chief analyst in military intelligence and former foreign policy adviser to the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, told ILTV that the conditions Israel has set for a ceasefire are 'totally unacceptable to the Lebanese,' meaning that, in its current form, such a deal would be unattainable. 'The Lebanese are not united against Hezbollah,' Neriah said. 'You have at least 50% who side with Hezbollah.' So, why is newly appointed Defense Minister Israel Katz saying Israel and Lebanon can end the war?

Antisemitism envoy: 2024 has been a year of a ‘tsunami’ of antise...	ILTV News speaks with Israel’s antisemitism envoy Michal Cotler-Wunsh in the aftermath of the Amsterdam 'pogrom' The violent attack against Jews in Amsterdam over the weekend was not unique to Europe but just another incident in what Israel’s antisemitism envoy Michal Cotler-Wunsh described as a 'tsunami of antisemitism' this year. She said October 7 was the 'worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust' and led to the 'mainstreaming of antisemitism' around the world, including anti-Zionism, which denies Israel’s right to exist. Israeli fans were assaulted after a soccer game in Amsterdam by groups of young people. Five people were treated at hospitals, and dozens were arrested after the attacks, which were condemned as antisemitic. According to Cotler-Wunsh, 'what is happening in the streets in Europe is happening on university campuses, at sports and cultural events.' She added that, in the same week, the only kosher restaurant in Washington, D.C. had its windows shattered, and in New York, a father walking with his six-year-old was attacked, with the child nearly pulled from his grasp. 'It’s not just about traveling or not going to sports events,' the envoy said. 'It is much larger. It is much bigger. The genie has been let out of the bottle.'

US carried out strikes against Iran-linked targets in Syria	The U.S. military said on Monday it had carried out strikes against nine targets associated with Iranian groups in Syria. In a statement, the U.S. military said the strikes were against two locations in Syria and a response to several attacks on U.S. personnel in Syria in the past 24 hours. The U.S. has occasionally carried out strikes against targets linked to Iran in both Iraq and Syria. In February, the U.S. launched airstrikes in Iraq and Syria against more than 85 targets linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) and militias it backs, in retaliation for a deadly attack on U.S. troops. 'These strikes will degrade the Iranian backed groups' ability to plan and launch future attacks on U.S. and Coalition forces,' the U.S. military said after the most recent strikes. The U.S. has 900 troops in Syria, and 2,500 more in neighboring Iraq, on a mission to advise and assist local forces trying to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State, which in 2014 seized large swathes of both countries but was later defeated. The U.S. has sent warships and fighter aircraft to the region since the Israel-Hamas conflict erupted on Oct. 7,to try to deter Iran and Iran-backed groups. U.S. forces have also helped shoot down projectiles that Iran launched toward Israel this year.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk1vhfemkl	2024-11-11T14:39:12-08:00

Rioters in Amsterdam set tram on fire, shouting 'Jews are a cance...	Masked rioters clashed with police and threw firecrackers hours after police announced more arrests in the violent attacks on Israeli soccer fans in the city late last week; Prime Minister of the Netherlands: 'Shock, shame and anger remain' Masked rioters in Amsterdam threw fireworks at a tram in the west of the city Monday evening, while shouting 'Jews are cancer.' The tram car, which was empty, caught fire and its windows were blown out. In addition, damage was caused to nearby vehicles. In the city square, where rioters threw fireworks and waved sticks, clashes broke out between dozens of young people - who were dressed in black and wore masks - and police forces. A few rioters were arrested, there were no casualties. The riot came hours after a meeting of the Dutch cabinet which focused on the attacks on Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer fans on Thursday evening in Amsterdam. During the debate, Prime Minister Dick Schoof said 'Four days after the attacks the shock, shame and anger remain.' He denounced the attackers and said it was 'antisemitism in every way.' Earlier on Monday, Amsterdam police announced the arrest of five additional suspects accused of involvement in the violent attacks on the Israeli fans at the end of Thursday night's match against the Amsterdam Ajax club. The police said that the suspects are 18- to-37-year-old residents of the city. In recent days, more than 60 suspects have been arrested in Amsterdam. The wave of attacks by Muslim and Arab rioters - most of them immigrants - caused a great uproar in the Netherlands. Coalition leader Geert Wilders commented on the attack on the Israelis and wrote on the X platform: 'Pogrom on the streets of Amsterdam. We will become the Gaza of Europe. Muslims with Palestinian flags are hunting Jews. I will not accept this. Never. The authorities will be held accountable for their failure to protect Israeli citizens. Never again.' On Sunday afternoon Amsterdam police dispersed a pro-Palestinian demonstration in the city's central Dam Square. The protesters who arrived at the square in the afternoon violated the ban imposed by the authorities on holding demonstrations over the coming days. The Amsterdam police announced on X Sunday afternoon that the gathering in the square was illegal, and that they would soon start arresting those who do not evacuate. Despite this, about 200 activists gathered in the square continued to barricade themselves, chanting pro-Palestinian slogans and anti-Israel epithets, including: 'From the sea to the river, Palestine will be free.' The police dispersed the demonstration and arrested dozens in the square. On Monday, the Dutch government announced that it has decided to prohibit free passage through its land borders in the coming months, in order to fight illegal immigration. The decision was announced by the spokesperson of the Dutch Minister of Immigration Marjolein Faber. The decision of the Dutch right-wing coalition, led by Geert Wilders' 'Freedom Party', will take effect on December 9. Border control will last six months. The Netherlands is one of the European countries that are members of the Schengen Agreement - which allows freedom of movement between the countries of the European Union. The member states of the convention are allowed to close their borders in exceptional cases, such as for example during the corona epidemic. The Netherlands joins a series of countries, led by Germany , that have decided to carry out checks on their continental borders, in order to fight immigration and strengthen internal security.

Conflict of interest: ICC chief prosecutor hires law firm with de...	ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan's engagement of Bindmans, a law firm linked to Palestinian advocacy, raises conflict of interest concerns, potentially undermining his impartiality in pursuing arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant; He's already under investigation for sexual harassment, which is blamed on Israel Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague Karim Khan is already entangled in a sexual harassment scandal currently under investigation by an external body, something his supporters have blamed on Israel. But now, his hiring the services of the British law firm Bindmans, a law firm linked to Palestinian advocacy, has put him in even more of a bind. This hiring decision may place him in a significant conflict of interest, potentially undermining his efforts to issue arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and recently-dismissed Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Bindmans represents several Palestinian organizations that have urged Khan to issue arrest warrants against senior Israeli figures. Notably, Tayab Ali, a partner at the firm, is the director of the 'International Center of Justice for Palestinians,' a London-based organization actively involved in international legal actions against Israel. Another partner, Alice Hardy, represents the Palestinian human rights organization Al-Haq, headquartered in Ramallah. These two Palestinian organizations, closely associated with Bindmans, have submitted multiple notices to the ICC regarding Palestinian issues. Additionally, the firm has ties to Khan's brother, Imran Ahmad Khan, and reportedly sponsored his involvement in an inquiry committee related to the detention of two Saudi citizens by the regime. Imran Ahmad Khan, a former British member of Parliament, is a convicted sex offender who was expelled from his party and sentenced to 18 months in prison for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. Khan is aligning himself with some of the most prominent and aggressive Palestinian advocates The scandal involving Prosecutor Khan was exposed last month by the British Daily Mail, which reported that an employee allegedly sexually assaulted by Khan confided in a colleague, who then reported the incident to senior court officials. Last week, Reuters reported that the ICC would launch an external investigation into the matter, and Khan was urged to suspend himself from his position during the investigation. On Monday evening, the ICC officially announced the external investigation against Khan. In a separate statement, Khan declared he would continue his duties on matters unrelated to the investigation, with issues concerning the investigation managed by his deputies. The Wall Street Journal speculated that Khan's request for the arrest warrants might be a 'diversion tactic' to shift attention away from the sexual harassment scandal. Attempts to obtain a response from Khan's office about whether his commitment to impartiality is compromised by being represented by pro-Palestinian lawyers went unanswered. Khan's spokesperson declined to comment and referred inquiries to Bindmans, which did not respond. An informed source commented that 'Khan's choice of this law firm indicates poor judgment. If he temporarily managed to deflect claims that his request for arrest warrants aimed to bury the sexual harassment scandal, demands for his dismissal will likely resurface at the upcoming conference of ICC member states in two weeks. By choosing this representation, Khan is aligning himself with some of the most prominent and aggressive Palestinian advocates.'

Rep. Elise Stefanik is champion of Israel in Congress, UN	President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Stefanik as his ambassador to the United Nations, even though she has no foreign policy experience; She's well known for her aggressive questioning of 3 university presidents over antisemitism on their campuses President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Rep. Elise Stefanik to serve as his ambassador to the United Nations, picking a loyal ally with little foreign policy experience to represent the U.S. at the international organization. 'Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter,' Trump said in a statement Monday announcing his pick for the role - his first selection that will require Senate confirmation. Stefanik, 40, who serves as House Republican Conference Chair, has long been one of Trump's most loyal allies in the House, and was among those discussed as a potential vice presidential choice. She is well known for her aggressive questioning of a trio of university presidents over antisemitism on their campuses that led to two of their resignations - a performance Trump repeatedly praised. Stefanik visited Israel in May and met with the families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza. She will be thrown into the United Nations' deep divisions from the wars in the Mideast and Ukraine to reining in nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran. She will also come face-to-face almost daily in the U.N. Security Council with the ambassadors of Russia and China whose countries are now strongly allied and looking warily at a second Trump presidency - and sometimes with their counterparts from North Korea and Iran. Stefanik will succeed U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a career diplomat and former assistant secretary of state for Africa who has held the job through the entire Biden administration and has been a member of his Cabinet. Stefanik also will be a member of Trump's Cabinet, he said in the statement. In Trump's first administration, he chose former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who had little foreign experience except for some trade missions, for the U.N. post. She resigned after two years and then challenged Trump for the GOP nomination. John Bolton, a former U.S. national security adviser under Trump and ambassador to the U.N. during the Bush administration, told The Associated Press that he sees Stefanik as the 2024 version of Haley. 'She wants to run for president in 2028. She realizes she has no foreign policy experience so what better way than to become U.N. ambassador,' Bolton said. 'She stays two years, and then away we go.' Born and raised in upstate New York, Stefanik graduated from Harvard and worked in former President George W. Bush's White House on the domestic policy council and in the chief of staff's office. In 2014, at 30, she became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, representing upstate New York. She later became the youngest woman to serve in House leadership. Stefanik was known early in her tenure as a more moderate conservative voice. But she soon attached herself to the former president, quietly remaking her image into that of a staunch MAGA ally and seeing her power ascend. She became the House Republican Conference Chair in 2021. Stefanik spent years positioning herself as one of Trump's most trusted allies and confidants on the Hill. She endorsed him in the 2024 race before he had even launched his bid, and aggressively campaigned on his behalf during the GOP primary. She saw her profile rise after her aggressive questioning of a trio of university presidents over antisemitism on their campuses led to two of their resignations - a performance Trump repeatedly praised. She also defended him vigorously in both of his impeachment trials and railed against his four criminal indictments, including filing an ethics complaint in New York against the judge who heard his civil fraud case. While she is a member of the House Armed Services Committee and serves on the coveted House committee that oversees national intelligence, her pick further solidifies Trump's preference for unconditional loyalty in his second administration over career experience. One area of foreign policy that Stefanik has been vocal about is Israel. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, Stefanik has focused much of her attention on the United Nations, accusing the world body and international organizations of antisemitism for their criticism of Israel's war with the terrorist group Hamas in Gaza. She has gone as far as calling last month for a 'complete reassessment' of U.S. funding for the United Nations, while helping push for the blocking of American support for the U.N. agency that provides humanitarian aid to Palestinians in the region, UNRWA. Her departure for the United Nations would also mean that Republicans, who are on track to have a razor-thin majority in the House, would be down one crucial vote. But Stefanik's district is located in a deeply red part of upstate New York, where Republicans are likely guaranteed to win the special election that would take place after she leaves office. 'Republicans will hold this safe Republican seat as part of a Republican majority in the House that will help deliver on President Trump's historic mandate,' Ed Cox, the chair of the New York Republican party, said in a statement Monday. Trump did not say much about the U.N. during his campaign, but has generally advocated for a less interventionist foreign policy. He also has repeatedly questioned the utility of international alliances, including NATO, and he has threatened allies with higher tariffs and said he will not protect them unless they contribute more to their own defense. Trump also has talked about how he initially wanted to select his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, for the role after he was elected the first time. 'You would be a great ambassador to the United Nations, United Nations secretary.' There'd be nobody to compete with her, I tell you' he said at a Moms for Liberty Summit in August. 'She may be my daughter, but nobody could have competed with her.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk06pkggye	2024-11-11T11:41:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/11/11/H1ER00ryGJl/H1ER00ryGJl_0_63_2944_1656_0_small.jpg
European leaders face criticism as anti-Israel protests escalate	Israel warns against upcoming games in Europe European leaders continue to turn a blind eye and appease the anti-Israel mob. In Amsterdam—despite a city-wide ban on protests—hundreds of anti-Israel protestors gathered in Dam Square, facing no real consequences. Meanwhile, Israel is calling on its citizens to avoid traveling to upcoming sports games in Europe. Police clashed with anti-Israel protestors in Amsterdam on Sunday, detaining more than 100 demonstrators. According to a police spokesman, they were not arrested but rather put on buses and dropped off on the outskirts of the city. This, despite hundreds of demonstrators openly defying the city ban on protests and gathering in the capital's Dam Square, waving Palestinian flags and chanting 'Free Palestine.' Dutch authorities placed a ban on protests in the city until November 14. The ban follows a night of antisemitic attacks on Thursday following the Ajax - Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer game, in which Israelis—including women and children—were hunted down in the streets of Amsterdam by mobs of Muslim immigrants in pre-planned and organized attacks. Meanwhile, the National Security Council has issued a warning urging Israelis to forgo the upcoming France-Israel soccer game in Paris set for Thursday. The council said that in the last few days, calls have been identified among pro-Palestinian supporters of terror groups to harm Israelis and Jews. As such, it advised Israelis to avoid games and cultural events with Israeli participation. Paris police said on Sunday that they would be deploying thousands of officers in the stadium and around the city for the game on Thursday to ensure security for Israeli fans. And French President Emmanuel Macron announced he would attend the game. His office said that his participation is aimed at sending 'a message of fraternity and solidarity after the intolerable acts of antisemitism that followed the match in Amsterdam.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk5fo1xmjl	2024-11-11T11:33:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/11/10/S1fgzbRZyg/S1fgzbRZyg_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
5 new arrests in attacks against Israeli soccer supporters, Dutch...	Dutch police on Monday said they had arrested five more people for their suspected involvement in attacks on Israeli football supporters late last week which authorities have condemned as antisemitic. The suspects are men aged 18 to 37 and living in the Netherlands, police said in a statement. Previously, 63 suspects had been arrested. Earlier on Monday Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof vowed that the Netherlands would focus all its efforts on bringing perpetrators of the violence to justice. Reacting to reports that there had also been altercations between Maccabi supporters and locals before the match on Thursday, Schoof said there was no justification for the violence against Israeli supporters.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1mzd1ezyx	2024-11-11T11:21:20-08:00	
127 air trucks enter Gaza Monday, only 85 collected on other side	Some 127 trucks carrying humanitarian aid passed through all the crossings to the Gaza Strip since the beginning of the day, but only 85 of them were collected on the other side of the crossing. So far, according to data from the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), 624 trucks entered the Strip in November. This is many fewer than demanded by the Americans, who have called on Israel to bring in 350 aid trucks a day. The entry of the trucks comes following the cabinet's decision in Sunday night's discussion to expand aid to the Gazans, a decision that has already been forwarded to the military echelon for implementation, to increase the number of aid trucks by dozens every day.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjdjh1efjx	2024-11-11T11:18:25-08:00	
Trump chooses New York Rep. Elise Stefanik as UN ambassador	President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Rep. Elise Stefanik to serve as his ambassador to the United Nations, picking a loyal ally with little foreign policy experience to represent the U.S. at the international organization. It is his first selection that will require Senate confirmation. Stefanik, 40, who serves as House Republican Conference Chair, has long been one of Trump's most loyal allies in the House, and was among those discussed as a potential vice presidential choice. She saw her profile rise after her aggressive questioning of a trio of university presidents over antisemitism on their campuses led to two of their resignations – a performance Trump repeatedly praised. One area of foreign policy that Stefanik has been vocal about is Israel. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, Stefanik has focused much of her attention on the United Nations, accusing the world body and international organizations of antisemitism for their criticism of Israel's war against Hamas. Last month she called for 'complete reassessment' of U.S. funding for the United Nations, while helping push for the blocking of American support for the Palestinian relief agency UNRWA. She will also come face-to-face almost daily in the U.N. Security Council with the ambassadors of Russia and China whose countries are now strongly allied and looking warily at a second Trump presidency â€' and sometimes with their counterparts from North Korea and Iran. Stefanik will succeed U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a career diplomat and former assistant secretary of state for Africa who has held the job through the entire Biden administration and has been a member of his Cabinet. Stefanik also will be a member of Trump's Cabinet, he said in the statement. In Trumpâ€™s first administration, he chose former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who had little foreign experience except for some trade missions, for the U.N. post. She resigned after two years and then challenged Trump for the GOP nomination. Haley was succeeded by then U.S. ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft, wife of a Kentucky coal magnate, who in 2023 was unsuccessful in her bid for the GOP nomination for governor of the state. John Bolton, a former U.S. national security adviser under Trump and ambassador to the U.N. during the Bush administration, told The Associated Press that he sees Stefanik as the 2024 version of Haley. â€œShe wants to run for president in 2028. She realizes she has no foreign policy experience so what better way than to become U.N. ambassador,â€ Bolton said. â€œShe stays two years, and then away we go.â€	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjutnrkmyx	2024-11-11T10:41:43-08:00	
Journey of Hope: Riding in memory of soldier killed in Gaza	The 24th installment of 'Wheels of Love' charity bike ride to raise funds for the ALYN pediatric rehabilitation hospital is dedicated to the memory of Yakir Hexter, a combat engineering soldier who fell in battle in southern Gaza Strip; 'The fact that we can help people connects us to Yakir, who strongly believed in the Wheels of Love cause' Cyclists from Israel and around the world participated Monday in the 'Wheels of Love' charity bike ride with the goal of raising donations for ALYN Hospital, a pediatric rehabilitation hospital. This is the 24th year that the charity bike ride is being held, and this year, it is dedicated to the memory of Yakir Hexter, a soldier who served in combat engineering unit 8219 and fell in battle in the southern Gaza Strip. 'The fact that the Wheels of Love charity bike ride is dedicated to Yakir’s memory this year makes it very personal for us,' says Yakir’s brother, Ezra Hexter, 20. The charity bike ride, with more than 200 cyclists participating began on Monday and continues until Thursday, but already on Monday some of the participants have ridden south to the site of the Nova music festival and to Kibbutz Be’eri. Ezra Hexter, Yakir’s brother, is participating in the Wheels of Love charity bike ride for the first time. 'My father participates in Wheels of Love every year and Yakir was supposed to participate last year,' he says. 'The goal of this event is to raise money for a very wide array of children, and only this hospital can treat them.' Ezra said that participating will not be easy, but is worth the effort to commemorate Yakir. 'The bike ride is incredibly grueling and painful, and only those who have experienced it can understand. The fact that we can help people connects us to Yakir, who strongly believed in the Wheels of Love cause. We’re very moved.' Teens undergoing rehabilitation at ALYN Hospital participate in the charity bike ride – which was held even during the COVID pandemic, including teens dealing with cerebral palsy, various disabilities, orthopedic problems, cancer and more. They train with special instructors for a year and learn how to ride customized bicycles – such as hand bikes and tandem bikes. The teens participate in parts of the Wheels of Love charity bike ride according to their ability in on-road and off-road routes. 'Doing something that I didn't think I could' One of the participants this year is 18-year-old Ta’ir Shalem from Neriya, who suffers from cerebral palsy and has undergone several orthopedic surgeries. 'It’s very exciting and meaningful for me to participate in this bike ride,' she says. 'Riding my bike, this cycling journey, is something that I couldn’t do before. So, it’s very exciting for me to take part in an activity that I never thought I’d be able to do. And, most of all, it’s an honor for me to ride on such a charity bike ride that commemorates the fallen and makes dreams come true.' The tremendous excitement is also accompanied by considerable stress due to the physical exertion during the cycling. 'Actually, it’s simpler than I thought. I am riding a tandem bike, which is a bicycle for two riders, me and another volunteer in front, so he is actually responsible for maintaining balance and adds his pedaling push to the strength needed, and that’s how I can ride.' Naomi Liberman, executive director of Friends of ALYN Hospital says that the 'Wheels of Love initiative has been taking place for more than 20 years and cyclists from abroad arrive every year to participate in this charity bike ride. It’s moving to see how people from all over the world come together for such an important cause, to raise donations for the hospital, which embraces the children and their families throughout their rehabilitation journey and instills hope during the most difficult moments. 'This year, the Wheels of Love bike ride has dual significance – both fundraising and commemorating Yakir Hexter, who was part of the Wheels of Love family of cyclists and fell in battle in Gaza. This is not just a cycling event, but an event of faith and hope for a better future for the hospital’s children and for the entire State of Israel.'

Families of hostages tell thousands of Jews at DC rally its time ...	Relatives of Israelis still held in Gaza take part in annual Jewish community rally at National Mall and call on US and Israel to work together to expedite efforts to complete a hostage deal that brings their loved ones home Families of Israelis held hostage in Gaza called for their release in addresses before thousands at the 'Stand Together' rally in Washington, the largest gathering of the U.S. Jewish community. The annual event, held at the National Mall overnight Sunday, was organized by the Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA). Among the speakers were Yarden Gonen, sister of hostage Romi Gonen; Daniel, Orna and Ronen Neutra, the brother and parents of Omer Neutra; and Daniel Lifshitz, grandson of Oded Lifshitz. They urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to 'End the war before the presidential inauguration on January 20. The time is now.' 'A deal is the only way to bring the hostages back, return them to life and allow the deceased to be laid to rest. We saw this when 100 hostages were released in a deal last November. Netanyahu said Sinwar was an obstacle to a deal, but he was eliminated. The international community must pressure Hamas to come to the negotiation table and make a deal, now,' Daniel, Orna and Ronen said in their speech. The thousands in the crowd displayed their support for the families, holding signs with photos of the hostages and calling for their return. Outside the venue, at the Hostages U.S. organization, activists displayed a giant sign where participants wrote messages to the hostages, pledging to do everything possible for their release. 'We haven’t forgotten you and we won’t stop fighting.' 'The solution is clear – unity. Unity for a free world fighting against terror. We must stand together for the release of the hostages and for justice,' Yarden Gonen said in her speech. 'This is a fight not only for Israel but for everyone who believes in peace and dignity. We must work together.' She added: 'Imagine the moment Romi is freed. I want all of you to feel that you helped bring her home. We must bring everyone home now.' 'Our nation is in deep pain,' Daniel Lifshitz added. 'Soldiers are dying in war, and our families cannot begin to heal until our loved ones return. A deal is the only way to bring our hostages home and heal as a nation. We need our leaders to make brave decisions.' 'My grandfather is a peace activist who believes in people and the power to create change. He never gave up on peace or on ways to bridge the divides between us. For him, for [Yehud] Arbel, and for all those affected by October 7 and beyond, we must do everything we can to bring them home now. Their lives are in our hands.' '401 days in captivity - a shame for Biden and Israeli government' Adi Alexander, whose son Edan is still held in Gaza, spoke with Ynet before leaving for Washington. 'We have a busy week ahead and we hope to make the most of it,' he said. 'Our goal is mainly to ensure that our issue doesn’t fall through the cracks in the transition from U.S. President Joe Biden's administration to the Trump administration. I hope we can connect all the parties who’ll be involved with the hostages in the future and ensure a smooth transition.' 'Each time we meet, we feel like things are moving forward,' he added. 'There’s some conference, summit or additional call that President Biden holds. We’ve executed a considerable number of actions over the past year. They haven’t borne fruit yet, but diplomacy never works until it does — and I sincerely hope it works this time.' Talking about the messages the U.S. administration has been conveying to families, he added: 'They’re constantly changing; sometimes we hear we’re close to a deal, other times we’re further from it.' 'Disasters often happen along the way that prevent it for one reason or another, or when each side becomes more entrenched in its stance, which is very frustrating and disappointing. The fact that we’ve marked 401 days in Hamas captivity is a shame for both the Biden administration and the Israeli government,' he added. 'I met with Trump about a month ago,' Alexander said. 'We had a relatively long and personal meeting before he knew he was going to be elected. Maybe he felt he would be. He made us a promise that the hostage issue would remain a top priority and I hope he follows through on that.' 'I hope this issue doesn’t drag on until after the inauguration,' he added. 'There’s an argument that now President Biden won’t be bound by the consequences of a tougher or bolder stance when it comes to negotiations.' 'I don't know how they're surviving' Former hostage Yelena Trufanov, whose son Alexander remains captive in Gaza, said in an interview with Ynet that her son is marking a second birthday in captivity. 'Today I feel just like I do every other day,' she shared. 'I didn’t think it would take so long. It seemed like it would happen soon, maybe in a month or two. It just doesn’t end.' Yelena, who lost her husband and house on October 7, added: 'I don’t know how they’re surviving. Every day I pray that they have food, water and air.' When asked how she copes, she replied: 'Only prayers, faith and support from others keep me strong. When people talk about a deal too much it means it’s not going to happen. Things are supposed to happen in silence. But I’m very hopeful. What else can I do? Everyone says, 'Don’t listen to the media,' but I don’t know who to trust.' She also spoke about her son. 'He’s smart, good-hearted and handsome. He has so many friends. When we were all there [in captivity], his friends took on the role our families would have, cared for us, were our voice and they’re still in touch, continuing to be our family. We’re all waiting for my son Sasha to come home already,' she said.

IDF reservist killed in Jabaliya, 1st soldier to fall in Gaza in ...	Major (Res.) Itamar Levin Fridman has been killed in Jabaliya by an anti-tank missile, making him the 783rd fallen IDF soldier since the Gaza war began A reserve officer from an elite unit has fallen in Jabaliya. The IDF announced Monday evening that Major (Res.) Itamar Levin Fridman, 34, of Eilat, a team commander in the Eilat Counter-Terrorism Unit, part of the Adom Division, was killed by an anti-tank missile in northern Gaza. Since the war began, 783 IDF troops have been killed. Fridman is the first soldier to fall in Gaza in nine days. During this time, two other soldiers were killed in the war on the northern front – Sergeant Ariel Sosnov, who was killed by rocket shrapnel upon exiting Lebanon, and Master Sergeant (Res.) Guy Shabtai, who succumbed to his wounds two weeks after being injured in a battle in Lebanon. Due to a shortage of fighters from elite units, teams from the Eilat Counter-Terrorism Unit are also participating in operations in Jabaliya. The raid in the city in northern Gaza, involving three brigades under the 162nd Division, is expected to continue for some time, as several thousand terrorists remain in the area. Fridman, who was killed in Jabaliya, is survived by his wife, Alma, and their two children – Ayala, 3, and Uri, 6. He completed a master's degree in economics and a teaching certificate at Ben-Gurion University's Eilat Campus. He worked as a financial advisor for families and taught economics and mathematics at Goldwater High School in Eilat. He also taught a computer applications course in the management department at the Eilat campus and was scheduled to teach the same course next semester. His friend Eilat eulogized him on Facebook: 'The heart refuses to believe, rest in peace, dear friend.' Another friend, Tal, wrote: 'Half an hour ago, I was the happiest person in the world. Now my heart is broken. There are no words.' Earlier today, the IDF reported that during operations in the Rafah area, Nahal Brigade forces discovered weapons caches full of ammunition stockpiles left behind in raids. In one of the searches, near a mosque and a hospital, a weapons cache was found containing observation posts, explosive devices, dozens of mortar shells and drones.

Qatari royals fight in UK court over 'Idol's Eye' diamond	Two branches of Qatar's royal family began their fight over a diamond worth at least $10 million at London's High Court on Monday, with a company run by a cousin of Qatar's Emir trying to enforce his alleged right to buy the 70-carat gemstone. The dispute over the 'Idol's Eye' diamond pits art collector Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani, cousin of Qatar's ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, against the relatives of former culture minister Sheikh Saud bin Mohammed Al Thani. Sheikh Saud, who was Qatar's minister of culture between 1997 and 2005, was one of the world's most prolific art collectors and bought the Idol's Eye diamond in the early 2000s. He lent the diamond to QIPCO, whose chief executive is Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah, shortly before his death in 2014. The agreement gave QIPCO the option to buy the diamond with the consent of Elanus Holdings, a company ultimately linked to Sheikh Saud's relatives. Elanus is ultimately owned by the Liechtenstein-based Al Thani Foundation, whose beneficiaries are Sheikh Saud's widow and three children. The two sides disagree over how much the gem is worth. Elanus' diamond expert valued the gemstone at around $27 million, which QIPCO's lawyers said was an attempt to achieve a higher purchase price.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkve36jm1e	2024-11-11T09:27:00-08:00

Trump names Stephen Miller to be deputy chief of policy in new ad...	President-elect Donald Trump is naming longtime adviser Stephen Miller, an immigration hard-liner, to be deputy chief of policy in his new administration. Confirming the appointment, Vice President-elect JD Vance posted a message of congratulations on Monday to Miller on X and said, 'This is another fantastic pick by the president.' Miller is one of Trump's longest-serving aides, dating back to his first campaign for the White House. He was a senior adviser in Trump's first term and has been a central figure in many of his policy decisions, particularly on immigration, including Trump's move to separate thousands of immigrant families as a deterrence program in 2018. Miller has also helped craft many of Trump's hard-line speeches. Since leaving the White House, Miller has served as the president of America First Legal, an organization of former Trump advisers fashioned as a conservative version of the American Civil Liberties Union. Because it is not a Cabinet position, the appointment does not need Senate confirmation.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byckt6yzyl	2024-11-11T09:16:14-08:00	
Knesset lawmakers aim to prosecute October 7 terrorists with 'gen...	Simcha Rothman and Yulia Malinovsky propose bill to establish special tribunal for prosecuting Nukhba terrorists involved in Hamas massacre, addressing legal and diplomatic obstacles with focus on justice for victims and national security Knesset Constitution Committee Chairman Simcha Rothman (Religious Zionism) and Yulia Malinovsky (Yisrael Beiteinu) introduced a legislative proposal on Monday aimed at prosecuting the Nukhba terrorists involved in the October 7 Hamas massacre in the communities surrounding Gaza. This initiative, disclosed to Ynet, includes the establishment of a 'special tribunal' for adjudicating genocide charges. The bill emerges after their year-long efforts to prompt government action on prosecuting the perpetrators proved unfruitful, reportedly stalled by the Security Cabinet. The cabinet cited concerns that prosecuting the Nukhba terrorists might hinder negotiations for the return of the hostages and dealings with Hamas It also is expected that some terrorists currently held in Israeli prisons may be exchanged and returned to Gaza and Hamas. Legal challenges also exist due to the difficulty in criminally linking specific terrorists to their crimes with the requisite precision. Rothman and Malinovsky, representing both the coalition and opposition, began addressing the issue with urgency in the Constitution Committee immediately following the massacre. Rothman even formed a subcommittee last December, operating under secrecy, summoning Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara for discussions. The primary focus was on legal challenges and whether to establish a special court for what could be seen as a 'show trial' or to conduct proceedings in a district court setting. Rothman stated that 'Under this proposal, a 'specialized court' for genocide will be established, distinct from a court for special cases, with authority to adjudicate additional offenses related to acts of genocide.' He noted that through amending the law it will initially be possible to criminally prosecute selected terrorists and detain any Nukhba terrorist following a brief administrative review. Here are the main points of the bill: The events of October 7 will be defined as 'genocide initiated by Hamas.' Legislation will be based on the 'Illegal Combatants Law' principle, defining the October 7 massacre as 'genocide initiated by Hamas.' A special administrative tribunal will be established to determine participation in the massacre using administrative evidence, which is easier to prove than regular criminal evidence. A prosecution committee, comprising representatives from the Ministers of Justice, Defense, and Foreign Affairs, will decide who among the group will face genocide charges. Anyone involved in planning, conspiring or inciting the massacre will be considered an illegal combatant. The terrorists will be classified into two groups: 'Illegal Combatants Forever' and those charged with genocide according to the Genocide Prevention and Punishment Law. A special court will be established for genocide trials, equipped with a legal team and experts in adjudicating such offenses. The tribunal will adopt special procedures set by the Justice Minister, tailored to the unique characteristics of the October 7 genocide events, with considerations for protecting victims and their families, and will adjudicate on prosecuting this crime collectively or individually. 'All of Israel is waiting for justice. We cannot accept a reality where more than a year has passed without any perpetrators of the heinous massacre being prosecuted. This bill will create the most appropriate path for justice to be served and seen,' Rothman said about the bill. 'The government had an entire year to deliberate and convene on prosecuting the terrorists involved in the October 7 massacre, yet, as with many other issues, correct decisions were not made, and the issue was not prioritized,' Malinovsky added. 'As a legislator, I feel it is our moral duty to the victims and families. This is a matter of national importance, an event of unprecedented scale. With all due respect to the Prime Minister, the government, the Minister of Justice, and the Attorney General, I have decided, together with Knesset Member Simcha Rothman, to advance and present our bill outlining the principles and foundations as we see the solutions.' Additionally, Ynet reported on another bill submitted by Rothman aimed at revoking the 'standing right' of the Palestinian Authority and its affiliates. This law would prevent the Palestinian Authority from filing petitions to Israel's High Court or lawsuits in other Israeli courts. The proposed law, which amends the Basic Law: The Judiciary and revokes standing rights for those rewarding terror, has significant support from the right and some centrist factions. The explanatory notes for the amendment state: 'The purpose of the law is to correct a distortion whereby entities hostile to the State of Israel, including those who openly and directly act to harm its citizens through acts of terror, are considered to have standing in the High Court when petitioning against the policies of the Government of Israel.'

Palestinians mark 20th anniversary of Arafat's death: 'We will pr...	Palestinian Authority holds dozens of ceremonies to commemorate first Palestinian leader, who killed hundreds of Israelis and signed the Oslo Accords The Palestinians are marking the 20th anniversary of the death of Yasser Arafat, the first chairman of the Palestinian Authority who signed the Oslo Accords with Israel, but who was also behind a series of terrorist attacks against Israel and its citizens, leaving hundreds of casualties. While the PA holds its ceremonies on Monday commemorating the man who once was Israel's main adversary, the current Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, is visiting Riyadh, Saudi Arabia for the Arab-Islamic summit. The summit will discuss ending the war and supporting the Palestinians, and Abbas will take advantage of the occasion and speak about the war in Gaza. 'We will preserve Arafat's legacy and not stray from it. We will remain rooted in our land,' stated Abbas, who added that it is impossible to abolish the existence of the Palestinian people, just as it is impossible to eliminate the Palestinian issue. 'Our people in Gaza are subject to a second Nakba. The occupation has turned the Gaza Strip into an inhabitable area.' Arafat, the founder of Fatah and the Palestine Liberation Organization, died at the age of 75 on November 11, 2004 at the Percy Army Training Hospital in Clamart, near Paris. Before he was the chairman of the Palestinian Authority, he was responsible for countless attacks and the deaths of many Israelis, and was considered one of the main factors in the failure of the Oslo Accords. He founded Fatah together with a group of other Palestinians in the 1950s, and became the movement's official spokesperson in 1968. In 1974, he addressed the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where he said: 'I came to you carrying the revolutionary rifle in one hand, and an olive branch in the other. Don't drop the olive branch from my hand.' In September 1993, as part of the peace process with Israel, he signed with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin the Oslo Accords that led to the establishment of the Palestinian Authority. In 2000, the Al-Aqsa Intifada broke out - according to Israel at the behest of Arafat - during which Palestinian terrorists murdered hundreds of Israelis with almost daily attacks throughout the country. Israel accused Arafat of being the one directing the acts of terrorism, and in the last two and a half years of his life, mobilized troops around his office in Ramallah. Eight years after his death, his widow Suha filed a complaint with the court in Nantes claiming that he had been poisoned and murdered. Arafat's grave was opened for several hours and investigative teams from Switzerland, France and Russia collected samples. They concluded he was allegedly poisoned by a radioactive element but French experts finally determined they were naturally occurring in the environment. Finally, the French Attorney General stated that it cannot be determined that Arafat was poisoned to death as claimed by his widow.

Pure fiction': Kremlin denies Trump-Putin post-election call	Following report alleging a phone conversation between President-Elect Trump and President Putin, the Kremlin issued a firm denial, saying no conversation took place, nor is one scheduled; Ukraine is apprehensive about the prospect of Trump pressuring it to accept Russian cease-fire proposal without returning territory In a firm rebuke, the Kremlin dismissed recent U.S. reports alleging a dialogue between President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin about the Ukrainian conflict. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov categorically denied such discussions, labeling them as 'pure fiction' and 'simply false information.' Peskov further indicated that Putin currently has no concrete plans to engage with Trump. Originally reported by the Washington Post, the narrative suggested Trump and Putin had conversed post-election results, with Trump reportedly advising Putin against escalating the Ukrainian war. This claim was later echoed by Reuters, citing undisclosed sources. In a surprising midday statement, Peskov criticized the Western media, asserting these reports as 'the clearest example of the quality of information currently being published, sometimes even by media outlets with a fairly respectable reputation.' The Washington Post elaborated that Trump allegedly conducted this conversation from Mar-a-Lago. During the purported call, he 'advised' Putin against intensifying the conflict in Ukraine and 'reminded him' of the substantial U.S. military presence in Europe, hinting at increased American intervention. Trump and Putin's discussion reportedly aimed at achieving 'peace in Europe,' with Trump expressing a desire for follow-up talks to 'discuss finding a solution to the war in Ukraine soon.' The article also touched upon Trump's campaign trail assertions, where he purportedly supported a peace agreement allowing Russia to retain territories acquired during the conflict. Sources indicated Kyiv was forewarned about the call and did not object, a claim later refuted by the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. Now, significant doubt surrounds the conversation's occurrence. In recent months, Russia has steadily advanced in eastern Ukraine, capturing more villages and towns. The election of Trump, known for criticizing U.S. financial support to Ukraine and promising to end the war 'within a day,' has buoyed Russian spirits. Western allies and Ukrainians fear Trump might coerce them into accepting Russia's cease-fire terms, perceived by Kyiv as total capitulation, by threatening to halt military aid. Russia has seized about a fifth of Ukraine's territory, and President Volodymyr Zelensky's administration refuses to end the conflict without a Russian withdrawal, an idea Russia categorically rejects.

Afghanistan attends United Nations climate talks for first time s...	Afghanistan's first delegation at United Nations climate talks since the Taliban's return to power in 2021 has arrived in Baku, Azerbaijan on Monday in a bid to garner support for climate action in the climate-vulnerable nation. Matuil Haq Khalis, who's head of the country's environment protection agency, told The Associated Press that Afghanistan is among the worst affected nations by climate change and needs the world's support to deal with extreme weather like erratic rainfall, prolonged droughts and flash floods. Afghanistan is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with a recent assessment by climate experts ranking it the sixth most climate vulnerable country in the world.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryhwy21fkg	2024-11-11T08:07:05-08:00

Iran planned attack against Israelis in Sri Lanka, assassination ...	FBI indictment reveals Farhad Shakeri, who also was instructed by Iran to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump, was ordered by the IRGC to target Israelis in Sri Lanka and to murder two US Jewish businessmen in exchange for up to $1 million Iran planned a mass shooting attack targeting Israelis in Sri Lanka, and attempted to assassinate two Jewish businessmen for their prominent pro-Israel activities on social media, according to an FBI indictment filed over the weekend in the United States. The indictment, which was revealed to the public, disclosed that the FBI thwarted an Iranian agent's plot to assassinate American and Israeli targets, including President-elect Donald Trump. According to the indictment, an individual named Farhad Shakeri, 51, was instructed by a senior figure in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to carry out a mass shooting at Sri Lanka's Arugam Bay, a popular destination among Israeli tourists. Shakeri directed his assistant, who was later arrested by authorities in Sri Lanka, to conduct surveillance of the area and lead the attack squad equipped with AK-47 rifles and other weapons that had been provided in advance. The indictment further reveals that Shakeri was offered up to $1 million, or $500,000 per person, to assassinate two Jewish businessmen in New York. The two, whose names have not been disclosed, were targeted by Tehran due to their prominent pro-Israel presence on social media. Court documents state that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps provided Shakeri with photos of the businessmen from social media and requested that he carry out the job swiftly and discreetly. These new details add to those disclosed on Friday, revealing that on October 7 of this year, Shakeri received a high-priority directive to develop a surveillance plan of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, in order to assassinate him. Shakeri is an Afghan immigrant who previously served a 14-year prison sentence in the United States for robbery. During his time in prison, the indictment notes, he became acquainted with two New York residents: Carlisle Rivera, also known as Pop, 49, of Brooklyn; and Jonathon Loadholt, 36, of Staten Island. The two men later became Shakeri’s agents on U.S. soil and his partners in the plot to assassinate Trump, ultimately leading to their arrest. Shakeri was deported from the United States in 2008 after his release from prison. He was subsequently arrested in Sri Lanka on drug trafficking charges, where authorities seized 92 kilograms of narcotics in his possession. According to U.S. intelligence, Shakeri is currently believed to be residing in Iran.

Smotrich orders Defense Ministry to prepare for West Bank annexat...	After congratulating President-elect Trump for his victory, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich lays the groundwork for West Bank annexation in 2025: 'The year 2025 will be the year of sovereignty for Judea and Samaria' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich congratulated Donald Trump of upon his re-election during the Religious Zionism Party faction meeting on Monday and called for Israeli sovereignty to be applied throughout the entire West Bank. 'After years of unfortunate interfering in Israeli politics by the current U.S. administration and choosing not to cooperate with me as the finance minister of the State of Israel, I congratulate the elected administration and look forward to working together for the benefit of strengthening the economic and commercial relations between our countries,' Smotrich said. 'Trump's victory also brings with it an important opportunity for the State of Israel. We were a step away from applying sovereignty to the settlements in Judea and Samaria, and now is the time to do it. Today there is a broad consensus in the coalition and in the opposition that the establishment of a Palestinian state would endanger the existence of the State of Israel. 2025 will be the year of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria. I instructed the Directorate of Settlements in the Defense Ministry and the Civil Administration to begin professional and comprehensive work to prepare for applying our sovereignty,' he said. National Unity Party chairman Benny Gantz commented on Smotrich's words. 'The schism between the efforts of our military forces on seven fronts and the coalition's attempt to tear us apart from within screams to the heavens. I ask the members of the coalition, how can you live with yourselves? The families of the reservists are collapsing and you take care of those unwilling to draft to the IDF?' 'The people want to unite and you are returning to the judicial overhaul. Thousands were evacuated from their homes and you are building more government offices and inflating political budgets? Have you forgotten October 6? Have you forgotten in whose name we are here? Have you forgotten that Judaism pursues justice, and not the gatekeepers?' 'The army needs to be more careful in the way it uses the reservists,' Gantz said earlier, commenting on Ynet's report on the drop in the number of reservists willing to serve. 'It is possible to critically observe with more attention to who is called up, how many are called up, where they are sent, and what is their mission. We must ensure they are not called up so easily for reserves. I trust the commanders to do that,' Gantz added. In the first months of the war, after the October 7 massacre, 100% of soldiers serving in the reserves showed up to join the fight. Although all positions were filled, many insisted on being deployed and some even returned from travel abroad to enlist. The ranks in all reserve units were full, and additional reserve personnel requested and pressed to join. However, in recent weeks, the figures have dropped to an average of 75%-85%. According to the IDF's estimates, the main reason for the decline in the willingness to serve stems from exhaustion after the reserve forces were in battle for months at a time and were repeatedly called up again and again in the year since the war broke out. A senior security official confirmed that the reserve combat soldiers would be required to serve at least 100 days next year and be called up for 45 to 60 days every four months on average. In addition, security officials warn that the government has yet to allocate funds for financial support for soldiers in the reserves, many of whom lost businesses and income. Overall, the funds allocated for reservists last year reached about 9 billion shekels. Currently, nothing assures the reservists they will be appropriately compensated for their service compared to the tens of thousands of shekels each reservist received last year.

Far-right Independence Day march in Warsaw draws thousands	Tens of thousands of Poles including nationalist opposition chiefs walked through Warsaw on Monday in an annual Independence Day event held by the far-right, some shooting red flares and carrying anti-EU, anti-Ukraine and white supremacist banners. The march has become a point of friction between Poland's hard-right and conservatives on one hand and the liberal center, in power since a general election last year ended eight years of nationalist rule, on the other. The government of Donald Tusk has been in power since December but its leftist and center-right junior coalition members are struggling in opinion polls amid infighting over key campaign issues such as a return of abortion rights. Thousands carried red-and-white Polish flags on Monday, while some chanted 'White Europe of brotherly nations!' or 'Stop the European Union!', or carried banners reading 'Stop mass migration' or 'Stop turning Poland into Ukraine.' Warsaw authorities said some 90,000 people took part in the march, while organisers put the attendance at around 200,000.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkx00nnkgjl	2024-11-11T07:45:40-08:00

Trump's return could mean end of 2-state solution	Donald Trump’s reelection could pave the way for Israel to adopt a one-state vision championed by adviser David Friedman. The British Peel Commission first proposed separate Jewish and Arab states in the region in 1937. Since then, the concept of a two-state solution has sparked fierce debate between Jews and Palestinians. Decades of Palestinian attacks on Israelis and growing societal isolation have eroded public support for a two-state solution. Polls in Jerusalem and Ramallah have consistently shown a decline in support for the plan. Following the traumatic events of October 7, 2023, the two-state solution lost nearly all public support in Israel. By July 2024, the Knesset had overwhelmingly passed a resolution rejecting the creation of a Palestinian state permanently. With former U.S. President Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the 2024 presidential election, the United States may now join Israel in moving beyond the two-state model, signaling a shift toward a new approach grounded in current realities. David Friedman, one of Trump’s key advisers on Israel, has authored a book outlining an alternative plan. With Trump heading back to the White House, there’s a possibility that, as US president, he will enable Israel to put Friedman’s vision into action. 'I believe Donald Trump will give Israel a free hand to decide our own destiny,' said Josh Reinstein, head of the Israel Allies Foundation, which educates and empowers an international network of pro-Israel legislators. 'Trump understands that Israel is America’s greatest ally and that we understand our own security concerns.' The incoming president has a history of supporting Israel, shaped mainly by key advisers, including top evangelical Christian advisers like former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Ambassador Friedman, who is Jewish. Trump’s first term saw nine significant pro-Israel policies enacted. These included moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, declaring that Israel is not an occupying force in the West Bank (but rather that the territory is disputed), withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, defunding UNRWA, withdrawing from UNESCO, enacting the Taylor Force Act, closing the Palestinian mission in Washington, and signing an executive order to combat antisemitism. However, one policy that Friedman advocated for but was not implemented was the annexation of Area C, the area in the West Bank currently under Israeli control. Now, many believe that under Trump, Israel will have the freedom to pursue it. 'We want the ability to claim sovereignty over Judea and Samaria without interference,' Reinstein said. He added that, while past US administrations pressured Israel to take actions counter to its national interests, 'now the pressure will be lifted.' Reinstein suggested that if Friedman returns to a strategic role, Israel’s path forward will be smoother. Friedman is one of the very few who have been with Trump since day one and remains in his inner circle. At February’s National Religious Broadcasters conference, he was the only audience member Trump called on stage. Rumors last month suggested that Trump might name Friedman as US ambassador to the United Nations or secretary of state. Even without these titles, Friedman is expected to play a leading role in the new administration’s Israel policy. In September, Friedman published a book titled 'One Jewish State: The Last, Best Hope To Resolve the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict.' His book proposes extending Israeli sovereignty across the West Bank and offering permanent residency to the 2.7 million Palestinians living there. It also calls for American and Gulf support for a 'Marshall Plan' to boost the region’s health care, education and prosperity. 'One Jewish State is a roadmap for an alternative to the two-state solution that many leaders in Israel have informally adopted,' Reinstein said. 'This is the future, and the two-state solution is the past.' Friedman was in Israel in October, hosting events around his book. One event, which attracted several hundred supporters, was a Middle East Summit with Israel365, an Israel-based organization that connects the country with Christians. Days later, Friedman held an event in the West Bank attended by 10 Israeli government ministers, all of whom backed his vision. Friedman first developed the plan for his book after the October 7 massacre, in which Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel, killing 1,200 Israelis and kidnapping over 250 others. He said over the summer that the plan was already in his mind, but October 7 underscored for him that a two-state solution could no longer be viable. Since then, he and Rabbi Tuly Weisz have collaborated to advance the plan. Leading up to the presidential election, Weisz was working to gain mainstream support for Judea and Samaria in the hope of a Trump victory. Weisz said that he has spent the past year galvanizing the pro-Jewish settlement community and connecting them with Trump’s team in the U.S. 'We have brought many important leaders to Judea and Samaria over the last two years and have started working closely with Ambassador Friedman so that his vision for one Jewish state will become policy in the upcoming Trump Administration,' Weisz said. Knesset Member Simcha Rothman, chairman of the Land of Israel caucus, led the resolution against a Palestinian state, which garnered the support of 68 of the 120 members of Knesset. 'The idea that a Palestinian state is a no-go in Israel is widely accepted in Israel. So now, people ask, if not a state, if not a two-state solution, what is the next step? What is the solution? Sovereignty is definitely an option,' Rothman said. Nadia Matar, an Israeli activist who attended the Middle East Summit, co-chairs the Sovereignty Movement and founded Women in Green, expressed similar views. She said her organization has been advocating for sovereignty for more than 20 years, but after October 7, the concept became mainstream. 'The Land of Israel belongs to the people of Israel,' she said. 'We need Israeli sovereignty. We all say no to a Palestinian state. What has taken many, many years to promote has all of a sudden become something normal.' The concept of a one-state solution that respects Palestinians and offers them autonomy, similar to Puerto Rico’s status, is something Trump’s evangelical Christian community also supports. Evangelicals back Israel due to their literal reading of the Old Testament, where Genesis 12 says Christians should support Israel: 'I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you.' -This article is written by Maayan Hoffman and reprinted with permission from The Media Line Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/b1kmyjjfyx	2024-11-11T07:26:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/19/rJmx8ImgUC/rJmx8ImgUC_4_0_1277_719_0_small.jpg

MBS condemns Gaza 'genocide' in Riyadh summit	Summit held for second consecutive year; Arab leader unanimous in condemnation of Israel and calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state and an end to the war Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman on Monday condemned what he described as the genocide of Palestinians in the war in Gaza. Speaking at the joint Arab League and Organization of Islamic Cooperation summit MBS said Lebanon's territorial integrity must be respected and criticized Israeli strikes on Iran. The crown prince said effort must continue to establish a Palestinian state. The summit in Riyadh is held for the second consecutive year and includes countries in the region. Last year, Iran's president Ibrahim Raisi attended the summit but the current president Masour P… was not in attendance this year. On Sunday, Saudi Arabia's chief of Staff visited Iran to meet with his counterpart. The two men discussed defense ties between the countries. Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said it is vital to impose an arms embargo on Israel as well as a trade boycott. Erdogan said the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was working to increase military tension against Iran. 'By banning UNRWA's work, Israel seeks to nullify a two-state-solution to the Palestinian conflict,' he said. 'Israel's aim is to settle in Gaza and to harm Palestinians in the West Bank and east Jerusalem.' The Turkish president also said Israel must be isolated internationally unless it ends its aggression in Gaza and Lebanon. 'We must encourage more countries to recognize a Palestinian state,' he said. Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said any attempt to separate the Gaza Strip from the West Bank must be rejected and the violence from settlers must be stopped. He called on the UN Security Council and the General Assembly to suspend Israel's membership in the international body. 'Nations of the world must examine their relations with Israel and not normalize them,' he said. Abbas also called to implement the General Assembly's decision regarding the opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and asked for support from an international coalition to bring about the establishment of a Palestinian state with full membership in the UN. In his concluding remarks Abbas said the PA was preparing mechanism for the administration of Gaza. Lebanon's caretaker prime minister Najib Mukati turned to representatives attending the summit and said his country was suffering from a historic crisis in dealing with Israel's aggression on top with other challenges. Without mentioning Hezbollah Mikat said the economic cost of Israel's military offensive compounds the disaster. 'I call on you to support Lebanon and its institutions and continue to send urgent aid,' Mikati said adding that his government is committed to UN resolution 1701, passed at the end of the 2006 Second Lebanon War, in full. Jordan's king Abdullah said the international community had not stopped Israel which continues to forge its war in Lebanon. 'We must increase efforts to break the siege on Gaza, prevent an escalation in the West Bank, support Lebanon's sovereignty and stop the war against it,' the king said. 'the international community must take a stand to prevent a humanitarian disaster in Gaza and to end the war.' Abdullah met with Egyptian President Abedel Fattah el Sisi on Monday on the sidelines of the summit, the Egyptian presidential palace said. the two leaders discussed regional matters and their efforts to stop the war in Gaza and Lebanon. 'The Israeli aggression against Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon has continued for over a year. We condemn the killing spree against civilians in Gaza,' el-Sisi said in a statement. ' 'A condition for security is the establishment of a Palestinian State along the pre 1967 war border and we will come out against any plan aimed at destroying the Palestinian question.'

drop reservists willing to serve raises concern	The IDF reveals a decline of about 15-25 percent in reservists showing up when called for duty in Gaza and in the north, affecting operational decisions while coalition pushes bill exempting Haredi men from service The IDF said it was dealing with a substantial drop in the number of reserve troops willing to serve in the prolonged war. According to the military there is a decline of 15% to 25% in reservists willing to report to a new round of duty including in combat units fighting in Gaza and South Lebanon, which has an effect on the IDF's operational decision. The concerning trend comes amid a push by the ruling coalition to legislate a law that would exempt ultra-Orthodox men from military service. In the first months of the war, after the October 7 massacre, 100% of soldiers serving in the reserves showed up to join the fight. Although all positions were filled, many insisted on being deployed and some even returned from travel abroad to enlist. The ranks in all reserve units were full, and additional reserve personnel requested and pressed to join. However, in recent weeks, the figures have dropped to an average of 75-85 percent. According to the IDF's estimates, the main reason for the decline in the willingness to serve stems from exhaustion after the reserve forces were in battle for months at a time and were repeatedly called up again and again in the year since the war broke out. A senior security official confirmed that the reserve combat soldiers would be required to serve at least 100 days next year and be called up for 45 to 60 days every four months on average. In addition, security officials warn that the government has yet to allocate funds for financial support for soldiers in the reserves, many of whom lost businesses and income. Overall, the funds allocated for reservists last year reached about nine billion shekels. Currently, nothing assures the reservists they will be appropriately compensated for their service compared to the tens of thousands of shekels each reservist received last year. 'You can't fight them' Even reservists who were supposed to start their school year at colleges and universities in the last few days now fear that the concessions and special considerations they enjoyed at the height of the war, would not be afforded to them this academic year. 'The resource of reservists is not unlimited, and it is extremely difficult for people to be absent so much in the middle of life. That is why there is a silent drop in the numbers of soldiers reporting for duty,' IDF officials said. 'The reservists often do not protest or make public declarations and we cannot argue, fight them, or demand by force they serve.' Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry hopes to 'buy' the reservists with various other economic benefits, but it seems they will not match the grants that softened reservists last year. In practice, the maltreatment of the reserve combat soldiers is so great that the IDF maintains its right to call up any reservist with zero notice. The IDF urged the government to legislate an increase of two to three time the previous amount of reserve duty and also extend the period of mandatory service from 32 months to three full years, to meet the growing demands of the military in the war. Coalition members have delayed legislation while they push ahead with a so called draft bill that legalizes draft dodging by Haredi men. The Haredi parties demand a bill to exempt some 60,000 ultra-Orthodox men every year in the years to come. Meanwhile, the plight of soldiers serving in the IDF reserves reached the Knesset on Monday in the special committee for the strengthening and development of the Negev and Galilee. The committee discussed the financial collapse of the reservists and their families after more than 400 days of war.

50 Hezbollah rockets fired at Karmiel, at least 3 hurt	IDF's Arabic language spokesperson tells residents of 21 South Lebanon villages to leave ahead of a strike on Hezbollah targets; foreign minister says talks of a cease-fire in Lebanon advance but challenge remains enforcing agreements Hezbollah fired a barrage of some 50 rockets at the norther city of Karmiel and its surrounding areas on Monday. At least three people were hurt including a toddler and a woman in her 20s who suffered moderate injuries. others suffered shock. Some of the rockets landed in the city and its surrounding while others were either intercepted or fell in unpopulated areas, the military said. The rocket fire came as reports in Lebanon indicated that the IDF issued a warning to residents of some 21 South Lebanon villages to leave ahead of a strike on Hezbollah targets. 'For your safety you must leave your homes immediately and move north of the Awali River, Major Avichay Adaree said in a post on X. A spokesperson for the Iran-backed terror group said there has been no proposal delivered to Hezbollah for a deal to end the fighting across the Israel-Lebanon border. Mohammed Afif said there are negotiations underway but there were no concrete advances in the talks. Earlier Foreign Minister Gideo Sa'ar said there has been progress with the mediation of the United States but the main challenge would be to ensure that an agreement is enforced.

'The most important matter for the future of the region is the prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons,' he said.

Iran aware of reports about Iranian-American journalist's arrest,...	Journalist Reza Valizadeh who worked for US government-funded broadcaster was believed to have been detained by Iran for some months Iran's foreign ministry was aware of reports about the arrest of Iranian-American journalist Reza Valizadeh in Iran, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said on Monday. Earlier this month, the Associated Press reported that Reza Valizadeh, an Iranian-American journalist who once worked for a U.S. government-funded broadcaster, was believed to have been detained by Iran for some months. 'We are aware of reports regarding the arrest of one Iranian national, he is an Iranian national and I do not have information on his second citizenship. We are in contact with relevant institutions to follow up on the case,' Baghaei said when asked about Valizadeh in a press conference. Iran does not recognize second nationalities and treats dual nationals solely as Iranians. The U.S. State Department had earlier acknowledged the imprisonment of Valizadeh, who previously worked for Radio Farda, an outlet under Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that is overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media.

Shin Bet stages coup against prime minister, his son claims	Yair Netanyahu slams Shin Bet in a series of tweets after news broke that his father's close allies in the Prime Minister's Office were under investigation for security violation; 'They fabricated the whole thing' to hide the military junta's Oct. 7 failings Yair Netanyahu, son of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, attacked the Shin Bet in a series of tweets oon Monday accusing the security service of staging a coup- against the backdrop of the security scandals being investigated in the Prime Minister's Office. Yair Netanyahu was referring to reports that the the prime minister was aware of Hamas activating Israeli SIM cards shortly before launching their massacre on October 7, despite Netanyahu's insistence that he was unaware. 'They fabricated the whole thing. This is gaslighting to hide the military junta's October 7 conversations from the public and the fact they concealed these talks from the prime minister,' he said in his posts. 'The Shin Bet that is now arresting and torturing IDF officers for slanderous nonsense is the same Shin Bet that released the Gazan Dr. Mengele - Shifa Hospital administrator from deteention along with dozens of other terrorists, a few months ago, in the excuse of lack of space in prisons?' Ynet reported that the Prime Minister's Office was under investigation for misconduct in handling highly classified documents. According to the investigation, people close to the prime minister made unauthorized copies of sensitive documents and misplaced them around the archive. This affair is connected to the suspicion that IDF intelligence officers and Eli Feldstein leaked information to harm the chances of a hostage release deal. In another tweet, the young Netanyahu accused the attorney general, the media, and the courts of a conducting a coup against the democraticly elected government. 'This is a coup against the people by the Shin Bet as if we were a South American banana republic in the 60s,' he said. In another tweet he wrote, 'The Shin Bet is much tougher on intelligence officers and Prime Minister's Office employees than Hamas terrorists,' in response to a report claiming that 20 terrorists had been released from prison in Israel. In another instance, the prime minister's son shared an interview with a former official who alleged that slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar may have been an intelligence source for the Shin Bet on 7/10, and gave false information that there was going to be a small operation. 'There are extremely dangerous people, monsters in the Israeli prison. I think the campaign of The Hostages and Missing Families Forum did a lot of damage. The terrorists are leading the negotiations for their release from the prison, and all the internal struggles in Israeli society give them an incentive to raise the price of releasing the hostages.'

Trump offers Elise Stefanik job as US ambassador to UN, report	Trump supporter drilled university presidents on their mishandling of antisemitism and anti-Israel incidents on their campuses during a House hearing; Trump says former ambassador Niki Haley, Mike Pompeo not asked to be part of his next administration President-elect Donald Trump has offered Republican Representative Elise Stefanik the job as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, CNN reported on Sunday, citing two unnamed sources. Reuters earlier reported that Stefanik, a fierce Trump ally, was under consideration for the role. 'President-Elect Trump will begin making decisions on who will serve in his second Administration soon. Those decisions will be announced when they are made,' Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump-Vance team said in an emailed statement, without confirming or denying the CNN report. Stefanik could not be immediately reached. She was the most prominent lawmaker during hearings held with the presidents of prestigious American universities in including Harvard, over their failing to adequately respond to antisemitism and anti-Israel conduct on their campuses An article in Politico claimed Stefanik had criticized the UN repeatedly over 'its antisemitism' and just last month said the U.S. should consider its funding of the international body following the move by the Palestinian Authority to bring an ouster of Israel from membership. Trump said on Saturday that former Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will not be asked to join his administration. Haley served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump during his previous term and had endorsed Trump for president despite having criticized him harshly when she ran against him in the party primaries. Trump is meeting with potential candidates to serve in his administration before his Jan. 20 inauguration as president. Reuters reported Friday that Trump met with prominent investor Scott Bessent, who is a potential U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee.

Muslim advocacy groups may have moved the needle in the US electi...	CAIR, the largest American Muslim advocacy group declined to endorse either of the major candidates, while Emgage endorsed Harris despite ‘strong disagreement’ with her Israel policy It’s still too early to know the extent to which advocacy around the Israel-Gaza conflict affected the US election. But the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), America’s largest Muslim advocacy group, says that Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss was significantly influenced by voters’ opposition to the Biden Administration’s Israeli policy. 'It is important for Democratic and other elected officials to recognize that Vice President Harris’ steep drop in support in key states compared to President Biden’s 2020 victory resulted, in part, from the deep frustration and disillusionment that many young, Muslim, Arab, Black, and other voters feel with the Biden-Harris Administration due to its steadfast financial and military support for Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza,' CAIR executive director Nihad Awad said in a press release issued the day after the election. CAIR Action, the organization’s lobbying affiliate, recommended that Muslim voters support 'candidates on the ballot and write-ins who support cease-fire, arms embargo, and other just policies, such as Dr. Jill Stein, Dr. Cornel West, and Chase Olliver.' In the days leading up to the election, CAIR sent out 600,000 text messages to Muslim Americans urging them to vote. An exit poll released by CAIR found that Green Party candidate Jill Stein was the preferred presidential candidate amongst Muslim American voters, with 53% of Muslim voters favoring her, followed by President Donald Trump with 21% and Harris with 20%. Stein, who is Jewish, received 0.5% of the overall popular vote. Her running mate was Rudolph 'Butch' Ware III, a Muslim convert from Washington, DC. Both Stein and Ware have expressed opposition to Zionism and support for the October 7 attacks. CAIR became a subject of controversy in December 2023 when its executive director said publicly that he 'was happy to see' Palestinians breaking out of Gaza on October 7 and that Israel, unlike Palestinians, had no right to self-defense. Those comments led the Biden Administration to disavow CAIR. The Anti-Defamation League has accused CAIR leadership of trafficking in 'openly antisemitic and anti-Zionist rhetoric,' noting that several organizational leaders were previously involved with an organization that funded Hamas. While CAIR claimed that Harris’ support for Israel contributed to her loss, some pro-Palestine candidates found that anti-Israel rhetoric didn’t help them win. One such candidate, Taher Herzallah, lost his race for the board of commissioners in Anoka County, Minnesota, on Election Day. 'Anybody who has any relationship or any support … or identifies themself as a Jewish person or a Christian Zionist, then we shall not be their friend. I will tell you that they are enemy number one, and our community needs to recognize that as such,' Herzallah said at a Zoom event days after October 7, 2023. National Republican strategist Brian Seitchik described antisemitism of this sort as 'now a vein of the Democratic party.' Herzallah’s opponent, Mandy Meisner, received 75% of the vote. 'While it is a really strong statement that the other candidate trounced him in the election, it is concerning that he still received 25% of the vote in an American election,' an Israeli American Democrat who asked for her name to be withheld said. CAIR Minnesota, Herzallah’s home chapter, did not release a state endorsement list. A group of prominent Somali American imams in Minnesota endorsed Harris, and she won that state. Several other state chapters of CAIR did endorse down-ballot candidates, mostly Democrats, but it’s not clear how much influence those endorsements had. Michigan, another swing state with a large Muslim population, voted against Harris. CAIR’s exit poll of 502 Muslim voters in Michigan had Stein at 59%, Trump at 22%, and Harris at 14%. Emgage Action, another Muslim American advocacy organization, endorsed Harris despite 'strong disagreement with President Biden over the crisis in the Middle East.' The group’s statement explained that the endorsement was meant 'not an agreement with Vice President Harris on all issues, but rather, an honest guidance to our voters regarding the difficult choice they confront at the ballot box.' 'There are those who say that voting third-party will punish the Democrats and teach them a lesson, but our communities—both home and abroad—will be the ones punished and caused the most harm by another four years of Trump’s fascism,' Emgage Action wrote. During his first term, Trump signed executive orders barring people from several Muslim countries from entering the United States. He has signaled that he will reinstate the travel ban when he gets back to the White House and that it will include Palestinians. 'I will ban refugee resettlement from terror-infested areas like the Gaza Strip, and we will seal our border and bring back the travel ban,' Trump told an audience at the Israeli American Council’s National Summit in Washington, DC, on September 19, 2004.

IDF bans small sailing boats in Med. south of Haifa	Unusual order restricting access to the waters along Israel's coastline is posted by the Shipping and Port Authority; military gives no detail or explanation for the order The IDF on Monday said it was banning all small boat sailing along the Mediterranean coast in the areas south of Haifa. The unusual order said no sail boats would be allowed in the waters along he Israeli coastline until 1PM. The military did not specify the reason for the restriction on sail boats that are less than 24 meters (26.2 yards) in length used for commercial or private purposes including yachts and motorized fishing boats. 'No person will enter or sail a small sailing vessel in the restricted area unless advance permission was given by the navy or anyone authorized by the navy to do so,' the Shipping and Ports Authority said. Marina administrators were asked to post the notice on their premises. The IDF said earlier that it had shot down four projectiles launched in Iraq that had targeted Israel. The military also said it intercepted a ballistic missile launched by the Houthi rebels in Yemen, before it entered Israeli airspace. Shrapnel from the intercept caused fires in Beit Shemesh.

Israel faces US deadline on Gaza aid, possible arms embargo	Officials must issue response to Biden administration letter threatening to halt arms shipments to Israel should aid to Gaza not increased by Thursday; Israel hopes Trump presidency will undo decision Israel’s Security Cabinet will convene on Monday to discuss increasing humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip in the backdrop of the U.S.’s threat to issue an arms embargo should it fail to do so. A decision must be reached by Thursday — the deadline set by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in their strongly worded letter they issued Israel. Three options are now under consideration: maintaining the current scenario, in which Hamas seizes the aid; having the IDF distribute the aid, though the military is strongly opposed to this or allowing an American security company to manage the efforts. A senior U.S. official estimated that an embargo is unlikely but stressed that the U.S. has conveyed to Israel its commitment to legal standards with no room for shortcuts. Israeli officials understand the need to fully address the American demand. The Security Cabinet must agree on a general response to Austin and Blinken's letter, with Israel required to submit its decision by Wednesday. 'Israel isn’t meeting the main condition of 350 trucks being sent per day; currently, around 220-230 trucks are passing through and now we need to think what we should do,' A government official noted. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer flew to the U.S. on Sunday to meet with senior White House officials, in part to discuss the situation on the northern border. According to the official, 'Dermer is going there to appeal to them,' regarding both the aid and the embargo threat. 'That Bibi’s [Netanyahu’s nickname] envoy is meeting with [Donald] Trump is significant as a hint that should an embargo take place, Trump would waive it, and the current administration needs to decide what legacy they’re leaving behind — retaliation against Israel or friendship.' 'There’s a positive trend in aid delivery. The Americans want 100 of the 350 trucks to come from the private sector, but Israel halted private sector transfers after Hamas intervened,' he added. The Security Cabinet will have to decide on these 100 trucks in dispute with the U.S. administration while security officials argue that Gazans aren’t starving and that the current range of 250-350 aid trucks already meets the humanitarian aid quota.

Asked if support for Ukraine had fallen since Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election last week, Healey told Sky News: 'As far as President Trump goes, he recognizes that countries get security through strength, just as alliances like NATO do.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hynignygye	2024-11-10T22:21:36-08:00

uptick in Israelis leaving the country, data shows	Israeli emigration soars by 42% as returnee numbers drop, signaling a troubling shift in migration patterns; The Shoresh report urges immediate action to address socio-economic and political factors driving citizens away amid ongoing national crises Data released by the Central Bureau of Statistics revealed a rise in the number of Israelis choosing to leave the country, even before the war broke out. According to the Shoresh Institution for Socioeconomic Research, relying on data from the CBS, there was a sharp increase of 42% in Israelis opting to live outside Israel's borders in he months after the current coalition of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power and during its legislative efforts to change the balance of power between the branches of government, with 24,900 leaving compared to 17,520. At the same time the number of Israelis returning after living abroad dropped by 7% relative the the past decade's average of 12,214 with only 11,300 returning in the same timeframe of 2023. This creates a persistent and statistically significant disparity between emigrants and returnees, with the former exceeding the latter by a striking 44%, thereby underscoring a systemic issue within the migration patterns. The report isolates native Israeli migration data, previously obscured by the inclusion of new immigrants, particularly from Russia and Ukraine, whose movements skewed broader migration statistics. By refining the dataset to focus exclusively on native Israelis, the report provides a clearer depiction of the migration trends impacting the local population. Authors of the report caution that this escalating emigration trend could portend significant long-term socio-economic ramifications, especially if the prevailing political and security crises persist. The statistical evidence suggests underlying socio-economic and political distress that warrants immediate policy intervention. The report articulates 'a critical inquiry into Israel's trajectory, emphasizing the necessity for strategic initiatives to address the determinants of migration and foster conditions conducive to retaining and repatriating its citizens. It is imperative for Israel to leverage this data insightfully to secure its demographic and economic future.'

Harrowing testimonies from Hamas’s torture chambers	Prominent Gaza lawyers says Hamas established a complete network of torture rooms and interrogation methods that have become central to its rule, as it classifies citizens as loyal or enemy and targets groups that dared to resist The torture practices documented in Hamas prisons, which the IDF revealed on Sunday, came as no surprise to Gaza residents. The people of Gaza are all too familiar with the methods adopted by the terror organization, the personnel recruited for the horrific acts, and the fear that accompanies a summons to interrogation rooms. 'This was every normal Gazan’s nightmare,' says a prominent Gaza lawyer who himself experienced Hamas’s torture chambers. 'Hamas has established an entire network of torture rooms and interrogation methods that have become the backbone of its rule. They used whatever was necessary to serve their interests, even lawyers.' According to him, 'I was asked to represent detainees, and Hamas officials told me, ‘Ask the detainee clever questions and relay the answers back to us.’ If they suspected someone of collaborating with Israel, they’d instruct me to ask if he was offered a listening device. If he said yes, they told me, ‘Report it, and your role is done.’' When the lawyer refused to cooperate, he was instantly labeled 'incompetent,' a designation that harmed his career. After he posted a call to protest power outages, he was summoned for interrogation and tortured. 'They hung me by my feet for hours, one of them hit my legs with a stick,' he recalls. 'For three days, I was interrogated and questioned. Eventually, they released me, warning me not to disrupt the public order. But I knew it was only a matter of time before they killed me.' Hamas sorts Gaza’s citizens into four categories: 'Neutral' (unaffiliated), 'Supporter' (of Hamas), 'Enemy' (Fatah and Islamic Jihad members), and 'Brother' (religious Hamas loyalists who preach that Hamas’s rule is 'the best'). Based on these classifications, the Hamas intelligence apparatus determines who needs to be tortured and to what extent. Salafist residents of Gaza—devout, radical Islamists who established the 'Army of Islam' aligned with al-Qaeda—have been frequent targets of Hamas’s torture. These Salafists, who often publicly condemned Hamas as 'infidel' and protested the taxes imposed by the rulers of the enclave, moved from mosque to mosque speaking against the organization. In response, Hamas would interrogate, torture, and attempt to brainwash them. Under Hamas rule, an unofficial rule developed: anyone who traveled to Israel for work, medical treatment, or trade was required to report for questioning the next day. If Hamas sensed unusual behavior, that person was often sent to the torture chambers. There, detainees would sit on child-sized chairs with bags over their heads, each assigned a number. On one occasion, a detainee was forced to stand on one leg, and if the other foot moved, he was beaten with a wooden stick. Prison guards were divided into investigation teams—usually educated individuals skilled in interrogation techniques—and torture teams, mostly comprised of Jabaliya refugee camp residents who hadn’t completed their studies and were tasked with beating detainees indiscriminately, maintaining complete emotional detachment. Dozens of detainees have died in Hamas prisons from torture. The latest victim was Issam al-Saafin, who was kidnapped, tortured, and killed in Gaza’s central prison solely for his affiliation with Fatah.

Sirens blared early on Monday in the central Plains as the hostile aircraft approached. Fires broke out in Beit Shemesh from shrapnel after the drone was intercepted. Firefighting teams were on hand to extinguish the flames. According to Magen David Adom (MDA) health emergency services, no injuries were reported. Earlier, Al-Masirah TV, the main television news outlet run by Yemen's Houthi movement, said early on Monday that a series of airstrikes targeted the Amran and Saada governorates, which they say were carried out by the U.S. and Britain.

Are Europe’s Jews ignoring dangerous antisemitic warning signs?	ILTV News talks with Chief Rabbi of the Netherlands Binyomin Jacobs While antisemitism is on the rise throughout Europe, Chief Rabbi of the Netherlands Binyomin Jacobs points to an important difference between now and the 1940s: 'The government is not antisemitic.' Rabbi Jacobs explained that people who are pro-Palestinian or support the creation of a Palestinian state should not be confused with those who are antisemitic, though he acknowledged that the lines between anti-Zionism and antisemitism are becoming blurred. The rabbi also commented on a recent incident in which a group of Israelis were violently beaten in Amsterdam after a soccer game because they were from Israel. He said he does not consider it a pogrom. Read: New hate records: Amsterdam pogrom reflects alarming trend across Europe 'A pogrom is organized by the government or by the church,' he emphasized.

Who will take over hostage-for-ceasefire negotiations?	ILTV News interview with Dan Diker, head of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs In an unconfirmed report, the Qataris have indicated they will no longer continue with hostage-for-ceasefire negotiations following the re-election of President Donald Trump. Dan Diker, president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, told ILTV News that 'Hamas has humiliated Qatar' because they did not agree to a ceasefire, and Qatar wants to save face with the new president. 'The Qataris are very mindful of the situation that would change with the election and the second term of President Trump,' Diker said. But who will take over? According to Diker, Qatar's pullback opens up an opportunity for either Egypt or Turkey to take a more leading role in the negotiations or perhaps even Saudi Arabia.

Palestinian president makes overtures to President-Elect Trump	Mahmoud Abbas uses Trump daughter's husband's family connections; condemns the assassination attempts in a letter, and is quick to congratulates his electoral victory in effort to mend relations with the returning President President Mahmoud Abbas has been crafting a strategy as intricate as a chess game to rekindle ties with the United States' freshly re-elected President, Donald Trump, especially after Trump's supposed backing of Israel during his initial tenure. This narrative unfolds in a comprehensive report by The New York Times, detailing Abbas' maneuvers before and after Trump's electoral victory. Before the ballots were even cast, Abbas was laying the groundwork to reach out to Trump. Often playing the role of intermediary was Massad Boulos, father-in-law to Trump's daughter Tiffany. This Lebanese-American businessman, now deeply entrenched in Trump's inner circle since his son Michael wed Tiffany, has become a pivotal player. Boulos had been a Trump supporter from the get-go, becoming increasingly enmeshed in American politics following a Christmas 2019 rendezvous at the White House. His influence ballooned after his son's 2022 marriage to Tiffany, culminating in a significant role during the latest campaign, where he successfully wooed Arab-American voters in pivotal states. Abbas crossed paths with Boulos at the fringes of the UN General Assembly in September. While Palestinian officials branded this meeting as Abbas' diplomatic overture to Trump, Boulos told The New York Times the encounter was 'completely personal,' and he kept Trump in the dark about it. Palestinian official Ziad Abu Amr, who was present and is seen as Abbas' confidant, relayed Boulos' message of Trump's intent to 'end wars worldwide, including in Gaza.' Boulos, along with Dr. Bishara Bahbah, a Palestinian-American Trump enthusiast, managed to deliver a letter from Abbas to Trump in July, condemning the assassination attempt. Trump responded, calling it 'very nice,' and declared, 'everything will be fine.' 'We want to maintain a good working relationship because one cannot ignore the United States' role in resolving the conflict,' Abu Amr remarked. In their September meeting, Abbas expressed readiness for peace with Israel based on a two-state solution and openness to international monitors in a future Palestinian state to secure Israel's safety, according to Bahbah. Boulos, speaking to Lebanon's LBCI network, mentioned Trump is gearing up for a new Iran deal, one that would be 'acceptable to the Iranians, neighboring countries, and the USA.' Boulos, dubbed by the Lebanese network as 'Trump's adviser on Arab affairs,' emphasized his policy of advancing Middle Eastern peace. On Lebanon, he stated there was no issue with Lebanese entities holding 'personal or medium weapons,' but the crux of the problem lay with 'strategic and heavy weapons,' namely those held by Hezbollah. Upon Trump's victory, Abbas was among the first to extend congratulations, paralleling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's actions. Abbas has maintained contact with Trump in recent months, with both parties affirming that the Palestinian leader assured Trump of 'no fighting, no invasions and no attacks' from a prospective Palestinian state. A statement from Abbas' office revealed he spoke with Trump, wishing him success and expressing a desire to work together 'to achieve a just and comprehensive peace.' It was noted that Trump confirmed his commitment to ending the war and showed willingness to collaborate with Abbas and other regional players to secure peace. The Palestinian leader underlined their 'commitment to achieving freedom, self-determination, and statehood, in accordance with international law,' stating, 'We will remain steadfast in our commitment to peace, and we are confident that under your leadership, the USA will support the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people.' A senior Palestinian official confided to Ynet that Abbas has fostered 'very good contact' with the newly elected president, a bond forged over the past year, surpassing the relationship with outgoing President Joe Biden. The official opined that the Authority welcomes Trump's election, albeit with slight reservations, 'if indeed Trump will act to establish a Palestinian state in practice.' Palestinians harbor grim memories from Trump's first term, marked by funding cuts to UNRWA and the PLO office in Washington, following the relocation of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and its recognition as Israel's united capital. In 2020, Trump unveiled the 'Deal of the Century' for a political settlement with Israel, a proposal the Palestinians resoundingly rejected as a 'disaster that harms their rights' for its exclusion of a Palestinian state.

Progress in US brokered Israel-Lebanon deal	Drafts exchanged between Jerusalem US envoy Hochstein and Lebanon PM Mikati; Security cabinet convenes to discuss potential deal Israel and Lebanon exchanged drafts through the mediation of U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein in what was described as progress in efforts to reach an agreement to end the fighting across the Lebanon border. The security cabinet convened Sunday after Hochstein, President Joe Biden's special envoy, has also exchanged drafts with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. The cabinet was expected to review all pressing issues, including updates on the ceasefire negotiations in Lebanon, the status of prisoners of war and missing persons, and the humanitarian situation. The Biden administration has set a firm demand for Israel to significantly improve humanitarian aid access to Gaza within 30 days, warning that failure to do so could lead to a U.S. arms embargo. Sources close to the negotiations report substantial progress, with an increasingly realistic chance of reaching an agreement. They attribute this to Donald Trump’s recent victory in the U.S. presidential election, suggesting that both Biden and Trump administrations share a desire to end the war before Trump's January 20 inauguration, ideally before winter sets in. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer flew to Washington on Saturday to meet senior White House officials. Last week, he also visited Russia to promote a Middle Eastern ceasefire, specifically focused on reducing tensions between Israel and Hezbollah in northern Israel. Israel recognizes Russia's influence over Hezbollah, Syria, and Iran and believes Moscow would welcome a ceasefire. In turn, Israel seeks assurances from Russia to prevent weapons smuggling from Syria to Lebanon, aiming to curb Hezbollah’s armament. The emerging agreement includes principles requiring Hezbollah to withdraw north of the Litani River. For the first 60 days, the IDF will remain in the initial line of Lebanese villages to allow the Lebanese army to dismantle Hezbollah's infrastructure in the buffer area between the border and the Litani. After this period, the IDF would pull back to the Blue Line. The ceasefire agreement outlines an enforcement mechanism. Israel insists on preserving military freedom if the mechanism fails, reserving the right to respond to any violations, a condition included in a side letter attached to the agreement. Hezbollah sources told Saudi Arabia’s Al-Hadath that the organization is willing to withdraw north of the Litani but rejects one term—Israel's freedom of movement in Lebanon. 'Hezbollah agrees to most of the stated terms, including avoiding rearmament,' the sources added. Israeli sources emphasize the importance of sealing off weapon smuggling channels, saying, 'If we don't, Hezbollah will rearm, and our efforts would be wasted.' They clarified that Israel's objective isn’t to destroy Hezbollah as it did with Hamas but noted, 'We have achieved significant progress against Hezbollah, and it’s fortunate we didn’t finalize a deal before achieving these goals.' According to these sources, the ceasefire will allow residents to return safely only if they genuinely feel secure, without Hezbollah snipers targeting them. 'This goal is achievable through the ceasefire, while we continue to target enemy positions, as we did today in Syria.' Discussions are ongoing between Israel and the U.S. to finalize the enforcement mechanism and Israel's operational flexibility. 'This doesn’t mean we need to be in Lebanon, but ultimately we need the capacity to enforce and act, and I’m confident we will have it,' one source said. Israel has also highlighted the strong alignment between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President-elect Trump. They share a common vision: an end to hostilities on all fronts that culminates in a decisive victory. Meanwhile, Dermer is expected to meet with Trump and his team to address two critical issues: ensuring Iran does not achieve nuclear capabilities and advancing normalization with Saudi Arabia. Dermer will present Trump with intelligence on Iran’s nuclear progress. 'Trump is determined to stop Iran, initially with sanctions, but our message is that only a credible military option will sway Tehran,' Israeli sources noted. One Israeli source pointed out that Netanyahu spoke with Trump three times in recent days, adding, 'We are aligned with Trump and share a unified vision.'

Saudi armed forces chief of staff in Iran for talks with official...	Iran state media says the leaders of the two militaries discussed development of defense diplomacy and the expansion of bilateral cooperation' The chief of staff of Saudi Arabia's armed forces, Fayyad al-Ruwaili, visited Tehran on Sunday to meet with his Iranian counterpart and discuss defense ties, state media reported the Iranian Armed Forces General Staff as saying. The visit follows the election of Donald Trump, who will take office for a second term as U.S. President in January, and who has promised to bring peace to the Middle East. During his first term, Trump initiated normalizations between Arab states and Iran's regional arch-enemy Israel, known as the Abraham Accords. Saudi Arabia has not established ties with Israel, but Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has discussed the possibility with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman multiple times over the last years, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Iran's state media said al-Ruwaili headed a high-level Saudi military delegation in Tehran and met Armed Forces Chief of Staff Major General Mohammad Bagheri and said the two military officials discussed various issues, including 'the development of defense diplomacy and the expansion of bilateral cooperation'. State media added that Bagheri held a phone call with Saudi Arabia's Defense Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman Al Saud last year to discuss regional developments and improve defense cooperation between the two countries. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal in October, Iran threatened Arab nations that if they assist Israel in its retaliatory attack on Iranian targets, they would be punished Earlier, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian spoke with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the phone, Iranian media said. Pezeshkian told the crown prince he would not be able to attend a summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Riyadh on Monday due to his busy schedule, and would be dispatching the Iranian first vice president as a representative, the Mehr news agency said. Tehran and Riyadh agreed in March 2023, via Chinese intermediation, to re-establish relations after seven years of hostility that had threatened stability and security in the Gulf and helped to fuel conflicts in the Middle East from Yemen to Syria.

IDF destroys Hezbollah complex under South Lebanon cemetery	Compound extends nearly one kilometer in length, reaches 2 meters in height, located approximately one and a half kilometers from the border The IDF destroyed an underground Hezbollah terror complex near the border with Israel, the military said on Sunday. The fortification was dug under a local cemetery. 'During activity in the area, troops identified several tunnel shafts leading into the compound, which led to the exposure of the full tunnel, the IDF spokesperson said. 'The forces investigated and dismantled the compound, which extended approximately one kilometer in length, reached approximately two meters in height and was located approximately one and a half kilometers from the border, and did not extend into Israeli territory. The spokesperson said hundreds of trucks and concrete mixers poured approximately 4,500 cubic meters of concrete into the underground compound. Earlier, Lebanese media said there were injuries in an IDF strike on a residential building in the village of Kharaib in the south of the country. Other reports claimed one person was killed and another injured in an attack on the village of Al-Marwaniya in the south, as well as additional casualties in strikes in various regions of Lebanon. Israel's new defense minister Israel Katz said Israel defeated Hezbollah, during a ceremony in the Defense Ministry. Soon after he spoke, sirens warned of rockets targeting the Upper Galilee region. 'When the moment came [to launch an offensive on Hezbollah] we did so with full momentum, and the blows dealt will be studied in warfare and military schools, Katz said. 'These are the blows that defeated Hezbollah. Now our task is to continue the pressure and realize the fruits of this victory by ensuring a change in the security situation in Lebanon, including preventing rearmament.'

Israel kills Hezbollah operative behind Hariri assassination, rep...	Salim Jamil Ayyash convicted of leading the hit squad that planted a car bomb killing then-Lebanese prime minister on orders from Nasrallah; US had $10 million bounty on his head A Hezbollah commander, who was convicted for the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, was killed in an Israeli strike, Saudi Arabia's Al-Arabiya network reported on Sunday. Salim Jamil Ayyash was reportedly killed in an Israeli strike on al-Qusayr, in Syria’s Homs region on Saturday. Ayyash, 61, born in the village of Harouf in southern Lebanon, holds American citizenship. The U.S. had offered a reward of up to $10 million for information on his whereabouts. He was a member of Hezbollah's Unit 121, the terror group’s 'assassinations unit,' which took orders directly from Hezbollah’s slain leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The U.S. Department of State said in a statement that Ayyash had also been involved in efforts to harm U.S. military personnel. On Dec. 11, 2020, the international tribunal established to rule on Hariri's assassination sentenced Ayyash in absentia to five life terms on terrorism charges connected to a February 2005 truck bomb attack in Beirut that killed Hariri along with 21 others, and injured 226 people. The court found that Ayyash led the hit squad behind the bombing and was actively involved in Hariri’s assassination. In June 2022, the U.N. Special Tribunal for Lebanon also sentenced two other Hezbollah operatives, Hassan Habib Merhi and Hussein Hassan Oneissi, to life in prison for Hariri’s assassination. The two were convicted in absentia by the tribunal in The Hague. Hezbollah then announced it would not surrender the two, just as it had refused to hand over Ayyash. The court found that Merhi and Oneissi had circulated a video clip in which a fictitious group claimed responsibility for Hariri’s killing, intending to shield Hezbollah’s operatives who had carried out the attack.

Pakistan criminalizes Zionist activity, sparking accusations of i...	Pakistan is home to at most 200 Jews and has no Zionist movement, raising questions about the rationale behind a new law that makes Zionism punishable by up to three years in prison Promoting Zionist ideas or displaying Zionist symbols is now a criminal offense in Pakistan following newly passed legislation. On Thursday, the Senate Standing Committee on Interior approved a bill that imposes a maximum three-year prison sentence for 'promoting Zionism to incite hatred' and a maximum two-year prison sentence for 'displaying Zionist symbols with the intent to create public unrest.' The bill was introduced by Afnan Ullah Khan of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (N) party. In his speech, Afnan said that 'the books of Zionism' call for killing dissenters. 'They are martyring children in Gaza under this ideology,' he said. No committee member opposed the bill Joshua S. Krug, a visiting professor at Germany’s Center for Jewish Studies Heidelberg, told The Media Line that Afnan 'seems to misunderstand the nature, history, and realities of Zionism and the modern Middle East.' 'There are no specific books of Zionism,' Krug said. 'Perhaps the senator incorrectly refers to the antisemitic Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a work long used to misrepresent Jews.' He noted that Zionists and non-Zionists coexist in Israel. 'Despite challenges, people from varied backgrounds, including Arabs and Jews, live and develop freely,' he said. In a short conversation with The Media Line, Afnan noted that the bill 'precisely opposes Zionism.' 'It does not target Judaism as a whole,' he said. 'In a civilized world, there is no place for an ideology that indiscriminately targets women and children,' Afnan said. 'Such acts of violence perpetuate fear, trauma, and suffering, causing lasting damage to affected individuals and communities.' He did not explain his rationale for introducing the bill in a country that has no Zionist movement to speak of. Before Pakistan’s independence, a significant Jewish community resided in the cities of Karachi and Rawalpindi. Jews lived peacefully for the most part and had several communal institutions. With the establishment of the state of Israel, antisemitism in Pakistan grew rapidly, and many Pakistani Jews fled to Israel. Today, no Jews are believed to remain in Pakistan. But for those who know to look for it, Jewish history in Pakistan is still visible. Karachi’s Merewether Clock Tower features a Star of David, and gravestones in the Juda Shahi cemetery have Hebrew inscriptions. This tower, named after Sir William L. Merewether, the Commissioner of Sindh at the time, built in 1892, stands as a testament to the multicultural history of this vibrant city. However, as time passed, a bustling transit hub emerged around this historic landmark Sajjad Azhar, a Rawalpindi-based historian, told The Media Line that the religious freedom that once characterized India and Pakistan has significantly diminished over the past century. 'The new bill reflects this intolerance,' he said. 'Pakistan’s recent anti-Zionism bill is perplexing because there is no active advocacy of Zionism or Jewish population remaining in the nation. It begs the question, what is the point of passing such a bill?' The bill, which stipulates that arrests for promoting Zionism will require a warrant and be classified as bailable offenses, appears to be largely symbolic. The symbolism may be intended to communicate Pakistan’s stance on international issues or to reinforce ideological unity within the country. Kaswar Klasra, an Islamabad-based geopolitics expert, said that the bill aligns Pakistan with the Palestinian cause. That alignment may 'complicate Pakistan’s diplomatic relations with countries taking a more nuanced view on Israel and Zionism,' he told The Media Line. He added that the new legislation may also curtail freedom of expression in Pakistan.

Levi (alias) who himself was attacked by pro-Hamas protesters says he wasn't surprised by the events, and he witnessed similar antisemitism and violence at his university Following the attacks on Maccabi Tel Aviv fans in Amsterdam by pro-Palestinians, a Jewish Amsterdam resident, who spoke under the alias Levi, shared what's like being a Jew in the city, and how he has to hide his Jewish identity or pro-Israel stance. 'We should say this is a fake name, Levi. Why do you choose to speak with us? Not under your real name? 'Well, frankly, it's just not safe for me to be here with my face and with my real name, we see what happens to anyone in Amsterdam that really has any sort of relationship to Israel. So I'm not gonna take any risks.' Levi, a few months ago, you were attacked by pro-Hamas protesters in Amsterdam, I assume the pogrom on Friday wasn't a surprise for you. 'No, it was not a surprise at all to be fair. We've seen pure Jew hatred and global antisemitism, and I've been a witness to it at my university. Even though they have not attacked Jews like that, just for being Jewish yet, we've seen now that they've been attacking Israelis and it was not a surprise for me at all.' Is it safe to be a young Jewish man in Amsterdam these days? 'Ever since October 7, we've seen the attacks in the universities. You cannot be openly pro-Israeli Zionist people don't even know the definition of Zionism to be fair. So, saying that you are a Zionist is not safe and I think 99% of the Jews are Zionists. I have a Star of David necklace. Usually, I don't wear it on the streets in Amsterdam. So, you're safe as long as you're not openly Jewish or pro-Israel.' So, what is the reason you still live and study in Amsterdam? 'Well, it's extremely sad that I don't even think that's an unfair question to ask. I'm fully Dutch, I'm from Amsterdam. I was born here. My parents are Dutch, My grandparents are Dutch, so for me to just move to another country, because of the fact that I cannot openly show a big very important part of my identity it's something I'm not gonna do now, but to be fair, I've been thinking about it, I've been talking about it, and it's not a crazy thing at all. But, yeah, let's hope I'm not forced to, and let's hope this is a tipping point for the government to show.' Speaking about the government, what are your thoughts on the authorities' actions towards the rising antisemitism, the riots against Jewish people, and Israeli soccer fans? 'Well, obviously there have been made a lot of mistakes. The fact that what happened on Thursday night, that's something like that can happen in Amsterdam, it's insane, we've all seen it coming. And the fact that our security agency apparently did not expect something like this to happen or at least did not maneuver themselves in such a way to prevent this from happening, it's crazy. Our coalition itself, our government itself is actually very pro-Jewish right now and a lot of politicians said that they are disturbed by the events. But there are also obviously a lot of politicians that are more lenient towards understanding, and some of them find to justify what happens. But our government itself right now is actually not antisemitic.'

Police crack down on pro-Palestinian protesters challenging prote...	After posting on X that the demonstration at Dam Square was illegal, police remove 100 demonstrators, putting them on buses to take them away from the city Amsterdam police on Sunday forcefully removed some 100 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who gathered at the Dam Square in contradiction of a ban on demonstrations imposed after the violent attacks against Israeli soccer fans last week. They were put on buses and dropped off on the outskirts of the city, police spokesperson Ramona van den Ochtend said, without confirming how many had been picked up. The police posted an announcement on X in the afternoon, declaring the gathering at the city's main square as illegal and warning that demonstrators would be arrested. Some 200 Palestinian supporters still showed up chanting familiar lines such as 'from the river to the sea Palestine will be free.' The standoff escalated swiftly as officers began removing protesters, and within the hour, the Dutch 'Telegraaf' reported numerous arrests. Scenes of confrontation spread in the press and on social media showing the police clashing with the demonstrators who shouted abuse at them. A member of the Amsterdam city council was arrested, having orchestrated his own arrest as a gesture of solidarity. Amsterdam's authorities had announced a three-day demonstration ban after the violence on Thursday According to reports, primarily immigrants and their descendants targeted Maccabi Tel Aviv fans, ambushing them at train stations and other city points post-match, wielding knives, batons, and fists. Some fans were deliberately run over, their passports and possessions stolen. At least one Israeli was documented in the canal waters, coerced to shout 'Free Palestine' under threat from the assailants. These disturbances, occurring just days before the Kristallnacht anniversary, sent shockwaves not only through Israel but also among Dutch and European communities. Amsterdam's mayor condemned the perpetrators as 'antisemitic hit-and-run gangs.' Initially, Dutch police announced the arrest of over 60 suspects. However, recent updates revealed that only four remain detained, including two minors, while more than 40 others received fines for 'disturbing public order.' Ten individuals face various charges, including vandalism, with further arrests anticipated. Olivier Dutilleux, the Dutch police chief, told a court that the bann on demonstrations was necessary after ongoing reports of antisemitic incidents. He said people were being ejected from taxis and threatened on the streets, merely for appearing Israeli.

Israel tells citizens abroad to stay clear of International sport...	National Security Council says observed indications of organized plans to attack Israelis, Jews in large gatherings using demonstrations as cover including in Brussels, Paris, Amsterdam and cities in the UK The National Security Council on Sunday cautioned Israelis abroad to stay away from cultural and sporting events with the participation of Israelis, days after the violent attacks on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam. According to the NSC, Pro-Palestinians groups were calling to attack Israelis and Jews under the guise of protests and demonstration, and while taking advantage of public gatherings at the events, in order to maximize harm and exposure in the media. The council said organized plans to attack Israelis were observed in several European cities including Brussels, Amsterdam, Paris and some major cities in the UK. Israel's national team is expected to play in a Paris on Thursday. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday that he would attend the match to show support for Israel after events in Amsterdam. On its web site the security council urged Israelis to exercise caution including avoiding any Jewish and Israeli markings, out of concern that terrorists or others will attempt to insert themselves into events and carry out attacks. The NSC recommended that Israelis refrain from attending any sporting or cultural event in the coming week, stay away from demonstrations of any kind, mask their Israeli identity when ordering taxis on apps and be aware of areas at risk when traveling around, including neighborhoods with predominately migrant populations from countries who are adversaries of Israel.

At least 7 dead in a strike attributed to Israel on Damascus	Strike on residential building in Damascus' Sayeda Zainab district, reportedly targets senior Hezbollah member in charge of Golan Heights; his son also killed in a drone strike on the Syria-Lebanon border in September At least seven people were killed and some 15 wounded in a strike attributed to Israel, on a residential building in the Sayeda Zainab district south of the Syrian capital Damascus on Sunday, the Syrian state news agency said. The target of the attack, according to Saudi Arabian media, was Ali Moussa Dakdouk charged with Hezbollah's operation on the Golan Heights, who acted as a military adviser to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iraq and Yemen and is wanted for his involvement in the murder of American troops in Iraq. His son Hassan Ali Dakdouk, a former commander in the Radwan force was killed in an attack in a drone strike on the Syria-Lebanon border area last September Sayeda Zainab, a stronghold of armed group Hezbollah and the site of a major Shi'ite shrine, has been the target in previous strikes. Israel has ramped up strikes in Syria since the Oct. 7 attack by militant group Hamas on Israel in 2023 and particularly since the escalation of the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. Syrian and Western intelligence sources say Israeli attacks in Syria have killed scores of Hezbollah and pro-Iranian militia fighters based around the eastern outskirts of Damascus and to the south of the city.

PM dispatches close ally to Trump, Herzog to visit Biden	Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, Netanyahu's closest ally in the cabinet to D.C. to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration; Strategic talks focus on regional stability, Iranian threats, and potential ceasefire with Hezbollah Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will dispatch Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer to meet U.S. president elect Donald Trump in Washington. Dermer is scheduled to visit to the capital for meetings with administration officials. Dermer recently visited Russia in efforts to advance a cease fire in the war with an emphasis on Lebanon. On Sunday, Netanyahu said he had already spoken to Trump three times since his elections last week. He told ministers during the weekly cabinet meeting that he and the president elect were in agreement on the threats from Iran adding that Israel has not changed its objective to ensure Iran does not obtain nuclear capabilities. The primary focus of Dermer's meetings with Trump and his team will be on northern border stabilization, discussions on a hostage deal, normalization with Saudi Arabia, and post-war plans for Gaza. Dermer will present Trump with intelligence gathered by Israel regarding Iran's nuclear program and the potential threat of Tehran advancing toward nuclear armament. On Saturday, U.S. political sources confirmed progress in negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. They noted an increasing likelihood of a settlement in Lebanon, spearheaded by President Biden’s envoy Amos Hochstein, with encouragement from Trump. There is also a concerted effort toward achieving a limited hostage exchange. Israeli officials believe Trump is keen to see a Lebanese settlement before assuming office. According to these sources, there is a significant push for a small-scale hostage deal. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Sunday that Hamas was an obstacle for a deal. Sulivan said the administration was reviewing the steps taken by Israel to improve the provision of humanitarian aid to Gazan civilians after an ultimatum presented by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin warning Israel of measures that may be taken if the humanitarian situation in the Strip does not improve. U.S. officials said that Qatar's announcement to set back from its role as a mediator between Israel and Hamas, was intended to exert pressure on the terror group. According to the officials, Qatar aims to clear diplomatic obstacles before Trump enters office, countering perceptions of inadequate pressure on Hamas. They said it was not likely that the Biden administration would impose an arms embargo on Israel during the remaining time in office. President Issac Herzog will also travel to Washington and is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden.

Netanyahu: Israel responsible for coordinated pager attack, Nasra...	Prime minister tells ministers he insisted on strikes, in the first official Israeli confirmation of responsibility; alludes his now ousted defense minister opposed but he insisted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel was behind the coordinated explosion of Hezbollah's communication devices. This was the first time Israel officially claimed responsibility for the attack. Netanyahu spoke at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting and also announced that Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The prime minister's comments came as he conducted the first meeting of his cabinet after sacking Yoav Gallant from his ministerial position as Defense Minister and replacing him with former Foreign Minister Israel Katz, a move that drew criticizm because Katz lacks any military and defense experience and while Israel was in the midst of war. In his address to the ministers, Netanyahu alluded to Gallant opposing the Israeli operations against the Iran-backed terror group and claimed he insisted that the attacks be carried out. He said there was a false media campaign being conducted against him and claimed that contrary to reporting, Hamas only increased its demands for a cease-fire and hostage release deal, after the murder of six Israeli hostages.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkyq6e011jx	2024-11-10T05:28:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/17/rJ9N3ePTA/rJ9N3ePTA_0_0_809_456_0_small.jpg

Shackled and whipped: IDF discovers 'thousands of hours' of Hamas...	Video and photographic evidence uncovered during Israeli raid show detainees enduring severe abuse at Hamas base in Jabaliya; one prisoner appears handcuffed to ceiling, another beaten with sticks during interrogations More than a year into the Israel-Gaza war, the IDF has obtained a trove of harrowing videos and photos alleged to show Hamas operatives interrogating and torturing Palestinian detainees, the Daily Mail reported on Wednesday. The footage, captured by CCTV cameras inside a Hamas base in the Jabaliya refugee camp and found on computers seized during an Israeli raid in March, reportedly includes thousands of hours of interrogation sessions. The footage, dated from 2018 to 2020, depicts detainees in distressing conditions, including being chained to floors and ceilings with bags over their heads. In one video, a man is shown crying out in pain. Another segment reportedly shows a Hamas operative leisurely reclining in a chair with his hands behind his head as a prisoner is seen handcuffed and hanging from the ceiling beside him. A third clip shows a man brutally tied up with a red sack over his head. One of the guards is later seen strangling the man. The IDF’s discovery comes amid ongoing concerns for 101 hostages still held in Gaza, more than 400 days after the October 7 massacre. Human rights groups have previously highlighted instances of Palestinian citizens—allegedly including political dissidents, LGBTQ individuals, suspected adulterers and those accused of collaborating with Israel—who were reportedly detained and subjected to abuse by Hamas. A senior IDF official told the Daily Mail that the military 'found these CCTV images in March. It took months to go through them all.' Hamas torture victim, Hamza Howidy, 27, told The Mail how he was detained for protesting against the regime in Gaza. 'They would torture you until you broke and say whatever it is they wanted,' he said. 'I could hear my fellow protesters scream in the next room.' Howidy, an accountant who later fled Gaza, estimated that he was held somewhere in West Jabaliya in 2019, but it is not clear if he appears in the videos obtained by the IDF. 'Hamas controls everything. They confiscated my laptop and had issues with my conversations with my girlfriend,' he said. He said that one of the men had been detained for three years and tortured three times a week. 'He had objects inserted into him,' Howidy added. 'One man was given electric shocks for two years before his innocence was eventually discovered. The first thing he did was shoot dead the Hamas officer who reported him – his uncle. 'You would never get a lawyer and your family would have no idea what happened to you. I was lucky because my family paid a price for me. I managed to leave for Europe via the Egyptian border in September last year, which cost a fortune, but my family there were told that should I return I'd be a dead man walking. Luckily I got them safe passage too.' He added: 'You just cannot tell who is a Hamas snitch or not.' 'One friend of mine was forced to divorce his wife when he got caught for something. There is a growing hatred toward Hamas now, especially after the war, but because Hamas controls the media and people are afraid, we hardly hear of it,' Howidy said. 'People outside of Gaza call Hamas freedom fighters when they are killing innocent Palestinians for nothing. Hamas is holding the people of Gaza hostage.' A former Israeli intelligence officer, known as Guy C, told the newspaper that Hamas' leader Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by the IDF last month, was 'obsessed with finding collaborators and held thousands against their will.' 'Some are electrocuted on electricity pylons or dragged on a chain from a vehicle until they die,' he said. 'Even worse, they won't allow the families a proper burial, and the bodies have a sign on saying they were collaborating.'

Who are the Hamas leaders set to be deported from Qatar?	Terror group officials say pushing leaders out of Gulf state isn't in US and Israel's interest, warning of complications in hostage deal negotiations Reports of Qatar agreeing to a U.S. request to close Hamas’ offices in Doha have raised the possibility of the terror group’s officials being removed from the country entirely. The Islamist terrorist organization claimed that pressure on Doha to expel its members would complicate cease-fire negotiations in light of Qatar announcing it was freezing its involvement in mediating a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. 'This isn’t in U.S. or Israel’s interest,' Hamas officials said. Hamas sources told Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat the group favors a model similar to that of the Afghan Taliban, which maintained offices in Qatar while fighting American forces and played a central role in negotiations that led to the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Hamas leaders have been based in Qatar since leaving Syria in 2011, following agreements with Doha and between the U.S. and Israel on conditions for their stay. Hamas has backup plans should its leadership be forced to leave Qatar’s capital, including relocating to Turkey, Iran or Lebanon. Hamas’ leadership believes Turkey offers a suitable base, as Hamas leaders frequently visit Ankara, maintain close ties with the Turkish government and enjoy wide public support, as well as significant aid sent from Turkey to Gaza throughout the war. Relocation to Iran is also a possibility, though this option could hinder efforts to reach a deal as it would likely strengthen militant elements within Hamas at the expense of more pragmatic voices. Hamas leaders in Qatar Hamas’ Qatar-based leadership primarily consists of its politburo. Former bureau head Ismail Haniyeh resided there until his assassination in Tehran in July. Khaled Mashal is Hamas’ envoy abroad. The U.S. Senate announced that several prominent members have requested federal agencies to extradite Mashaal to the United States and freeze Hamas assets in Qatar. Mashal’s wealth is estimated at $2-5 billion and he has lived a life of luxury in Doha for the past 10 years. He faced harsh criticism during the war for urging Gazans to hold their ground while he himself moved between Qatar’s upmarket hotels. Khalil al-Hayya is Hamas’ Gaza envoy and former deputy to former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, serving as his right-hand man. Al-Hayya is considered a key figure in negotiations with Israel, was one of the architects of the October 7 massacre and arrived in Qatar from Gaza shortly before the surprise attack. Trained by Sinwar to establish good relations with Iran, al-Hayya managed to climb to the top of the group’s hierarchy. Zaher Jabarin is Hamas’ West Bank envoy and it’s unclear when he moved to Qatar. Jabarin is regarded as Hamas’ 'financial mastermind.' He previously held the position of the group’s prisoner portfolio head and served as deputy leader of Hamas in the West Bank until Saleh al-Arouri’s assassination in Beirut in January. Ghazi Hamad is a member of Hamas’ politburo and left Gaza in August 2023, previously serving as the organization’s deputy foreign policy chief and as an advisor to Ismail Haniyeh and Hamas’ military chief Ahmed Jabari, who was killed in 2012. Hamad played a role as a mediator for Hamas in the deal to release Gilad Shalit in 2011 and is considered one of the most pragmatic leaders in the organization. While there’s no precise estimate of his wealth, he and his children are known to enjoy a lavish lifestyle. Mousa Abu Marzouk served as the Hamas politburo’s deputy head until Haniyeh’s assassination, living with his family in Qatar. He lived in the United States for 14 years and was arrested in 1994 for supporting terrorism. Two years later, he was deported to Jordan, then to Syria and Cairo in 2012. Despite his arrest, Abu Marzouk held onto his assets, with Germany’s Bild newspaper estimating his wealth at $2 billion. According to the Israeli embassy in Washington, he possesses $3 billion. During the war, his brother Yusuf was killed in an attack in Rafah.

Amsterdam pogrom against Israeli soccer fans premeditated, new ev...	Testimonies, evidence and video footage collected by Dutch police and Israeli security confirm violence not spontaneous as initially believed; taxi and Uber drivers reportedly participated, directing rioters to Israeli fans' locations Testimonies and forensic evidence collected by the Dutch police and Israeli security services, along with videos gathered by various security forces and intercepted messages from organizers of the pogrom against Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer fans in Amsterdam and provided to investigators show that the violence was premeditated and not spontaneous as initially believed. In addition, the attacks do not appear to be a response to provocations by Maccabi Tel Aviv fans as has been suggested in Dutch media. According to testimonies of Maccabi Tel Aviv fans, they were escorted by police only as far as the train station after leaving the stadium at the end of their team's Europa League match against Ajax. However, they reported that no security had been present as they boarded trains and arrived at the city's central station. Upon leaving the station, a large mob was waiting for them in different locations around the city. The attackers had been equipped in advance with tools such as knives, clubs and brass knuckles, along with smoke grenades and firecrackers. According to the evidence, taxi and Uber drivers were active partners in the pogrom and shared the location of Israelis in internal group chats. The message conveyed to each of those rioters was clear: 'Attack anyone who speaks Hebrew, wears Jewish symbols or comes with a yellow-blue shirt (Maccabi's colors).' Israel’s Diaspora Affairs Ministry alerted Dutch police in advance of a planned pro-Palestinian protest outside the Johan Cruyff Arena, but Israeli fans weren’t informed of the potential danger. This lack of communication left them unprepared for the violence that followed, attributed partly to insufficient planning by Amsterdam’s police. The assailants, who refrained from using knives, reportedly aimed to inflict severe beatings on the fans as a show of solidarity with Gaza. Many recorded the assaults, allegedly to further humiliate their victims. Initial reports of missing fans mostly involved those who had hidden, returned late to their hotels or whose phones ran out of battery. In the first hours, the Shin Bet security agency offered to dispatch a special team to locate the missing fans, though it was ultimately deemed unnecessary.

Targeting the head of the octopus': The Israeli Air Force divisi...	Established in February to execute years of planning, the Air Force’s Iran Division stripped the Islamic Republic of its defenses; 'When you’re prepared, nothing surprises you,' officers say The Israeli Air Force established an Iran-focused operations department in February amid escalating tensions in the region, recognizing the need for dedicated planning and operational support against Iran. While Israel’s military has long monitored Iran through various branches, including intelligence and the Air Force, officials say recent months have underscored the need for a specialized unit as threats became more tangible. 'This initiative was born out of necessity,' said Capt. A., an officer in the new Iran Division who took part in the historic October 26 strike against Iran. Iran is considered part of Israel's 'third circle' of threats, characterized by its distance from Israel and its independence as a regional power, Capt. A explained. 'Iran is a sovereign power capable of operating independently, which makes it unique among our adversaries,' he added. Initially, the military’s focus at the onset of the current war was closer to home. But as fighting evolved, the northern front, including Iran and its proxies, came into focus, prompting the IDF to expand resources toward those areas. At the start of the war, Capt. A was assigned to the Gaza theater. Similarly, Capt. N., head of the Air Force’s intelligence deep-operations division, had also been focused on Gaza. Capt. N led the intelligence efforts supporting Israel’s air raid in Iran. Parallel to the operational department, the intelligence wing has a 'Depth Division,' tasked with monitoring the second and third threat circles. Intelligence-gathering agencies provide essential insights that inform Israel’s strategic assessments and operational readiness. 'This is a massive, coordinated effort,' said Capt. N., describing her role in directing the flow of intelligence to operational commanders. 'Our work supports Capt. A, who directs aircraft in real time.' Concern for peers in the air The night of the strike was unlike any other attack in Air Force history, yet it felt similar to training exercises. 'That’s the beauty of it,' says Capt. A. 'When you’re prepared, nothing surprises you.' Maj. A., head of strikes in the Iran Division, recalls that night in the command center: 'The only thing on your mind is carrying out the mission, hitting targets and bringing everyone back safely. Hours of planning all lead up to this moment. Those pilots out there are my brothers in arms. You hear your closest friends over the radio, and you just want them to do their job well and make it back home.' When does the tension finally lift? 'When the operation ends, the last pilot lands and everyone’s back safely,' says Capt. N. Maj. A. adds, 'You breathe half a sigh of relief when you know the strikes were successful. The second half is when everyone’s landed. In the shower, it hits you—the magnitude of what we did. You feel it wash over you.' How do you start planning a strike on Iran? 'By identifying the what, who and where alongside the how,' explains Capt. A. 'Refueling, for instance, is a basic skill for every fighter pilot. Ultimately, we can reach anywhere.' Capt. N. adds: 'It begins with setting targets and defining our objectives. Then we build a picture of what we want to achieve, bringing intelligence on targets to the initial planning process. The intel is highly focused, ensuring we’re hitting precisely the right targets, refining where we’re certain and where we’re not.' The outcomes aren’t always immediately clear. Iran initially denied that Israel had hit anything significant, later admitting minor damage. But over time, Israel’s success became apparent, and Iranian threats intensified. Tehran’s officials now warn of an 'appropriate' response in their own time. Capt. N. notes that some immediate feedback can indicate success, but building the full picture takes time. 'I believe we succeeded,' she says. With the division’s formation, some ask whether more operations like Days of Repentance will become routine. 'This is an active front, and it will remain so as long as there’s an Iranian threat,' says Maj. A. 'We’ve shifted the dynamics—Nasrallah’s no longer relevant. We’re in a different event,' Capt. A. says, 'and establishing an Iran Division is our statement.' The Iran front differs from the Yemen front, though the Iran Division oversees both. Could increased Houthi activity open the Yemeni front too? 'The division was founded on the need to engage with Iran and its proxies,' says Maj. A. 'The Houthi enemy is funded by Iran. We need to tackle the head of the octopus.' Concern for hostages in Gaza The Air Force’s Iran Division didn’t start its intelligence work from scratch; it had a solid foundation to build on. Yet, establishing a new office was essential, and setting it up was part of the process. Maj. A. describes the team that has taken shape: 'We have an incredible group here. The planners, intelligence officers and reservists all share one focus—the success of the mission.' There was a lot of chatter after the first wave of strikes, even while our planes were still in the air. Are you aware of that in real time? 'Nothing distracts us when our planes are out there,' says Capt. N. 'I felt completely focused on the objective.' Are we already preparing a response to the response to the response? 'We’re always ready,' says Capt. A. He believes the war is far from over. 'At least, that’s how I see it. It all begins and ends with the hostages. That’s our focus and our goal. When we reach the end of this, I think we’ll see changes across the region—and I expect this division will keep expanding.'

Trump's win may be a rejection of 'woke' ideology - here's why	Analysis: Some Trump voters were seeking a president who will let them 'unapologetically worship God' For the first time in three campaigns, U.S. President Donald Trump won the popular vote—a rare achievement for any Republican since 1988. What led to such a sweeping victory? Many of the American citizens who voted for Trump may not have been endorsing him personally; instead, their votes were perhaps a rejection of 'woke' ideology and the ultra-liberal values associated with Kamala Harris. This election was, for them, a vote to 'make America great again' by realigning the country with its foundational principles, rooted in faith and the motto 'In God We Trust.' Many people of faith viewed the presidential election as a spiritual battle between good and evil, with Trump's supporters seeking to restore Christian or conservative values to the country. As such, for some in this group, Trump's victory—and his survival of two assassination attempts—was seen as the fulfillment of God's will. In his victory speech, Trump told his supporters that he was reelected 'to save our country and to restore America to greatness. And now we are going to fulfill that mission together.' According to Jim Daly, president of Focus on the Family, who spoke to the Washington Times, the election outcome 'confirms that American families are hungry to live in a nation where they can raise their children in an environment that is physically safe, economically viable, and where moms and dads and kids can unapologetically worship God.' What is woke? The term 'woke' began gaining popularity about fifteen years ago and has continued to evolve in meaning. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, in modern days, 'woke' figuratively refers to being 'aware' or 'well-informed' in a political or cultural sense. Originally, it signified support for pro-Black and pro-feminist causes and opposition to oppression—admirable qualities. However, in recent years, the term and the associated culture have shifted, increasingly embodying progressive extremism, cancel culture, and secularism. Today, 'wokeism' is related to ideas like sexual binarism, intersectionality and a strong anti-religion and state stance. Harris has advocated for 'staying woke.' Trump's win may suggest that the majority of Americans do not share that goal. Among Trump's supporters are 80% of white Evangelicals, nearly 70% of Latino Evangelicals, and more than 10% of Black Evangelicals. They seek a country that, in their view, embraces the Christian values upon which America was founded—even if some of these supporters are considered extreme in their own beliefs. 'I thank our Lord for having prevented the United States and the Western world from definitively falling into the tentacles of the deep state and globalist tyranny,' former Roman Catholic Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano wrote on X, urging Americans to pray that Trump resists 'the lobby of corrupt and perverted people.' Trump promised Christians they would have 'power at a level that you've never used before.' He vowed to crack down on the acceptance of transgender identities in schools and society and to stop the persecution of Christianity in America. Though Trump may not appear to be a conventional leader for a devout Christian community, many Evangelicals and others of faith have looked beyond his personal shortcomings. They believe God anointed him to serve in the White House—a belief that gained even more traction after he survived two assassination attempts. According to a CBS report analyzing voting percentages across various demographics, Trump gained approximately 30% of the vote in New York—outperforming every Republican candidate since Ronald Reagan 40 years ago. The report also noted Trump's increased support among young voters, including in Florida's Miami-Dade County, where he captured about 55% of the votes, becoming the first Republican to win there in 36 years. The Washington Post highlighted Trump's gains among non-Christian voters as well. In 2020, 29% of non-Christian people of faith voted for Trump, while 69% supported Biden. In 2024, Trump's share rose to 33%, with 60% voting for Harris, according to the Post. Among Jewish voters, about 66% voted for Harris, while 32% supported Trump, according to Fox News. However, in states like New York, he garnered as much as 50% of the Jewish vote, likely due to the higher proportion of Orthodox Jews compared to other parts of the country. Notably, the incoming president also secured 32% of the Muslim vote, matching his share among Jewish voters. Finally, Trump saw a rise in his share of the Catholic vote, with 56% voting for him this time compared to 47% in 2020, as reported by the Washington Post. The shift of younger people toward more conservative values is also evident in Israel. A poll released by the Israel Democracy Institute just before the U.S. election showed that among Israelis aged 18-34, an overwhelming majority believed Trump was better for Israel's interests than Harris, with 90% supporting Trump and only 2% favoring Harris. Several reports on Israel's judicial reform protests have shown that the attendees skewed older, suggesting that the older liberal left elite were more likely to oppose the reforms than younger generations. According to the IDI's latest Democracy Index, 73% of Jewish Israelis aged 18-24 identify as right-wing, compared to only 46% of Jewish Israelis over 65. According to polls, it was largely these young Jewish voters who helped elect Israel's most right-wing government to date in November 2022. The IDI noted that 'there is a significant overlap between religiosity and political orientation. In all religious groups, a majority define themselves as being on the right, with the exception of the secular group.' Since October 7, it is likely that this percentage has only grown. Whether Trump's promises and policies will ultimately fulfill his constituents' vision remains to be seen. Still, his victory should signal to American leaders a growing desire among young and faithful voters for a future more rooted in tradition and faith.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjbapl0zye	2024-11-10T00:17:58-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/15/r15pfn460/r15pfn460_0_0_1985_1361_0_small.jpg

D9 bulldozer shipment stalled by US embargo, leaving Israeli sold...	Security officials say over 100 new bulldozers ordered by Defense Ministry stuck in US amid growing contention over use to raze homes in Gaza; Washington approves purchase of additional APCs for IDF The partial U.S. arms embargo on Israel is affecting the battlefield in Gaza and Lebanon and could pose a risk to IDF soldiers. The U.S. is silently halting various arms shipments to the country but continues to support Israel in other ways, including a large-scale deal to acquire around 1,000 new APCs. New details reveal that an extensive shipment of 134 D9 bulldozers, which Israel ordered and paid for but are awaiting export approval from the U.S. State Department in Washington, according to two security sources who spoke with Ynet on condition of anonymity. The use of these bulldozers, primarily for flattening structures in the Gaza Strip, has led to significant internal criticism in the U.S., protests and intense pressure on U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration, which has succumbed and frozen deliveries for several months. The impact on the battlefield is already apparent in both combat theaters: Ynet’s inquiry shows that many of the existing D9 bulldozers, heavily used in the IDF maneuver in Gaza for months require maintenance. Additionally, the IDF has been engaged in a new ground operation in southern Lebanon, where these bulldozers are also needed. 'At the height of the fighting in Gaza, about a year ago, battalion commanders were ‘fighting’ between them over D9 bulldozers; now they need maintenance,' say commanders leading the fighting in Gaza. The IDF struggled to directly link the deadly outcomes of the raid in Jabaliya — in which 21 soldiers were killed, many due to explosive devices — to the number of D9 bulldozers allocated for operations. 'The bulldozers in these operations often lead the brigade’s combat teams, clearing ‘contaminated’ areas from explosive charges intended to detonate against infantry and armor troops. However, it’s clear that these machines aren’t only operationally effective against terror tunnels and in urban areas but also help save soldiers’ lives. Forces on the northern front are required to clear thousands of acres of dense thicket, which Hezbollah uses to conceal bunkers and weapons depots close to Israeli towns while preparing to invade the Galilee. The scope of the deal is estimated at several billion shekels, with the vehicles’ armor intended to be manufactured in Israeli facilities. The halt to bulldozer deliveries will likely delay another significant operation by IDF Southern Command that remains incomplete: establishing a one-kilometer-wide buffer zone between the Gaza Strip and the western Negev, on the Gazan side of the border — involving the leveling of hundreds of Palestinian buildings and agricultural lands. A substantial portion of these buildings has already been razed to the ground, but the operation is still incomplete. The U.S. has vehemently opposed this action, mirroring its anger over the ongoing demolition of thousands of Palestinian structures in Gaza on a daily basis. 'The fact there are videos of American D9 bulldozers demolishing homes in Gaza isn’t helpful, but it’s a necessity,' IDF sources said. 'These homes are used by terrorists.' In addition to using bulldozers, the IDF employs several other alternatives, some of which are more costly. These include controlled blasts using thousands of tons of various explosives and targeted airstrikes to demolish buildings, though more sparingly. This restrained approach is due to the need to manage munitions as the fighting expands and persists across seven active fronts. Another reason lies in the fact that the U.S. is still freezing the shipment of around 1,300 munitions purchased by Israel from Boeing — paid in shekels rather than with U.S. aid funds — each weighing nearly a ton, citing similar concerns that the IDF could use them against civilian populations. Half of this shipment, which was frozen in May ago by the Biden administration, has been released and delivered to the IDF, but the other half remains in U.S. warehouses. Israel is also renting engineering equipment from private contractors to support field operations. The delay in delivering the bulldozers and heavy munitions adds to the cold shoulder Israel received from Washington regarding the purchase of Apache attack helicopters earlier this year. At first, the Americans rejected Israel’s urgent requests to supply the Air Force with high-maneuverability attack helicopters. Later, Washington also opposed diverting part of the hundreds of new helicopters ordered from Boeing for the U.S. Army to Israel, a measure sometimes customary in such cases. 'Not all U.S. defense officials are completely on our side. While the administration has significantly increased aid by billions of dollars, sending tens of thousands of munitions and various armaments to the IDF, they’re still giving us a ‘penalty’ in the form of these embargoes,' defense sources explained. 'There are officials in the U.S. State Department, the White House and Joint Chiefs of Staff who aren’t quick to approve every one of our requests, in addition to the similar aid the U.S. has pledged to provide Ukraine in its war with Russia,' the sources added. However, the IDF is encouraged by another significant purchase the Americans have approved for ground forces: a dramatic increase in the acquisition of JLTVs, or Joint Light Tactical Vehicles. Around 300 vehicles were ordered initially, dozens of which have already arrived for the IDF, but this has now been expanded to approximately 1,000 vehicles. These fast-wheeled armored personnel carriers will replace the older M-113 APCs and will likely be deployed beyond the exclusive use of elite units. These large JLTVs will be outfitted with 30 mm cannons and remotely operated machine guns, with the deal’s cost estimated to reach about NIS 4 billion (approximately $1.1 billion).

Ukraine attacked Moscow on Sunday with at least 32 drones, the biggest drone strike on the Russian capital since the start of the war in 2022, forcing flights to be diverted from three of the city's major airports and injuring at least one person. Russian air defenses shot down 32 drones flying toward Moscow over the Ramenskoye and Kolomensky districts of the Moscow region, as well as in Domodedovo city, home to one of the city's biggest airports, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. He reported no major damage, though Russia's federal air transport agency said the airports of Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo and Zhukovo had diverted flights. The airports have since resumed their operations, Russia's aviation watchdog Rosaviatsia said. Moscow and its surrounding region, with a population of at least 21 million people, is one of the biggest metropolitan areas in Europe, alongside Istanbul.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h13negrwkl	2024-11-09T23:36:35-08:00

Coming here is like playing Russian roulette, but this is our he...	Eight farmers have lost their lives in recent weeks due to Hezbollah rocket fire, yet northern Israel’s farmers refuse to abandon their fields despite the heavy toll and lack of state support; 'Farmers are stubborn; we won’t be the ones to abandon our land' As olive harvest season begins, the Israeli olive oil industry faces significant challenges. Farmers in the north had hoped that by harvest time, the threat of cross-border fire from Lebanon would have receded, but that hasn’t happened. Harvest workers are forced to contend with ongoing risks in open fields, leaving many olives unpicked and at risk of becoming bitter and unusable. 'I know coming here is like playing Russian roulette, but what can I do? These are trees I planted in 1988—this is our heritage,' said Roni Bahmutski, who owns an olive grove near Metula on the Lebanese border. Last year, Bahmutski lost over 90% of his crop, unable to access his trees or hire workers to pick the fruit. This year, he’s gathering olives by himself, trying to salvage what he can. 'So far, the government hasn’t settled compensation for our 2023 losses. For some reason, olives were excluded from other fruit crop compensations,' he added, noting that aside from an advance payment covering part of his lost revenue, he has received no other support. Nearly 16 tons of olives went to waste. Tragedy struck last week when, just minutes after a heavy barrage on Metula, Bahmutski learned that his friend’s son, Omer Weinstein, had been killed with four workers in an apple orchard nearby. Despite the heartbreak and personal danger, Bahmutski continues working in his grove, even as he struggles to find laborers willing to help. 'When I heard Omer was gone, I cried like a child. He was family to us,' he shared. 'My home in Metula was hit too—windows and shutters shattered, the yard destroyed. We farmers risk our lives just stepping into our fields, but this is my livelihood and life’s work. My family and friends ask why I keep going, but I can’t let everything just fall apart.' Two weeks ago, eight farmers were killed while working in fields, orchards and groves unprotected from rocket fire out of Lebanon. Olive growers, too, have suffered: at a grove in Kibbutz Afek near Shefa-Amr, mother and son Mina and Karmi Hassan were killed. Just five days ago, teenager Sivan Sadeh lost his life while working in the broccoli fields near Kibbutz Kfar Masaryk, miles from the Lebanese border. 'When they report ‘strikes in open fields,’ they’re talking about our workplaces,' said Yossi Barash, owner of Barash Farm in Yesud Hama’ala. He acknowledges that, ideally, the Iron Dome air defense system would protect the entire country, even areas with minimal risk of casualties, though he understands this isn’t feasible. 'It feels like history is repeating itself,' he said—not nostalgically. 'Before the Six-Day War, farmers in Yesud HaMa’ala struggled to tend their fields due to Syrian shelling, and now we’re dealing with Hezbollah’s fire. Harvesting olives this year has been even harder than last year. When the war began, volunteers from pre-military programs and various organizations came to help, but now they aren’t allowed to come under Home Front Command orders.' Despite the challenges, Barash is determined to hand-pick every last olive himself, with a few foreign workers by his side. 'My ancestors dried out swamps here and fought malaria. Farmers are stubborn and resilient. We won’t be the ones to abandon our land or forsake agriculture.' Their dedication to the land may be hard for outsiders to understand, but farmers explain that it’s driven by Zionism—and, of course, the need to make a living. Eyal Ovadia, chair of the Banana Growers Council and CEO of Western Galilee Banana Growers, noted that 'since October 7, Israeli farmers have been forced to work under rocket threats, with only limited access to their crops, some of them evacuated and often without any shelter at all.' He sees farmers as 'the first line of defense in the battle for food security, paying with their lives so that Israeli citizens can continue to have a steady supply of fresh food.' Ovadia added that the eight farmers killed across the Galilee in one week 'were following the guidelines—when the sirens go off, they lie on the ground, hands on their heads and pray. I send my deepest condolences to all the families, and I hope that Sivan Sadeh will be the last victim.' Despite the sacrifices and constant danger, Ovadia hopes the public will show their appreciation, 'We’re coping with an almost impossible reality, and the fire only intensifies. The public needs to support us by buying more locally grown produce.'

Trump says Haley, Pompeo will not join second administration	US president-elect actively meeting with candidates for key positions, preparing for January inauguration, with former CIA director Pompeo and ex-UN Ambassador Haley now confirmed not to be part of new lineup U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday that former Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will not be asked to join his administration. 'I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley, or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump Administration, which is currently in formation,' Trump posted on social media. 'I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our country.' Trump is meeting with potential candidates to serve in his administration before his Jan. 20 inauguration as president. Reuters reported Friday that Trump met with prominent investor Scott Bessent, who is a potential U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee. Haley, a former South Carolina governor who served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, endorsed Trump for president despite having criticized him harshly when she ran against him in the party primaries. 'I was proud to work with President Trump defending America at the United Nations,' Haley said on social media. 'I wish him, and all who serve, great success in moving us forward to a stronger, safer America over the next four years.' Pompeo, who also served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Trump, has been mentioned in some media reports as a possible defense secretary and had been also seen as a potential Republican presidential candidate, before he announced in April 2023 that he would not run. Pompeo could not immediately be reached for comment Saturday. During his first term as president, Trump made some key personnel announcements via social media posts. Separately, Trump said the 2025 presidential inauguration will be co-chaired by real estate investor and campaign donor Steve Witkoff and former Senator Kelly Loeffler.

Political officials confirm there is 'progress'; Families of Gaza hostages head to Washington amid efforts to bring about a 'small deal'; In 1st, Netanyahu not invited to Jewish Federations of North America Families of hostages in Gaza set off to Washington overnight, where they are expected to meet with senior officials regarding the promotion of a deal in the near term, before a new U.S. government takes over in January. The families are set to meet with senior White House officials, alongside a series of meetings with Republican senators. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump sent a message to the administration of outgoing President Joe Biden, calling for progress to be made toward a settlement of the violence in the north, and U.S. officials claim, according to one, that 'the chances of settlement in Lebanon under (Biden envoy Amos) Hochstein's leadership - and with Trump's encouragement - are increasing.' Officials also claim that there is great effort going into arranging a 'small hostage deal.' Another report indicates that the Qatari announcement that it would suspend its mediation between Israel and Hamas is intended to 'increase the pressure on Hamas.' Qatar wants to clear the table before Trump arrives in order to correct the impression that it did not really exert pressure on Hamas, according to sources. In addition, the sources said that 'the chance that the Biden administration will impose an arms embargo on Israel in the remaining time is low.' The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Qatar announced Saturday night that mediation efforts between Israel and Hamas are frozen, but noted that 'the reports about their permanent cessation are not accurate.' Earlier, Israel had reservations about news agency reports about the end of the mediation and claimed that 'the decision is reversible.' 'Qatar will renew its efforts with its partners when there is the necessary seriousness to end the war. In that case, all efforts will be made to end the war and return the hostages.' Qatar's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. A security source said that Israel 'received an indication' that Qatar was about to expel the Hamas leadership. 'It seems that the Qataris are terrified of Trump. They understand that he will change the American direction toward them. They understand that they support terrorism. The Qataris are very afraid and want to look like good kids,' said the source. Hamas has denied the claims, and a source close to one of the senior members of the terrorist organization told Ynet that Qatar made the move in response to 'massive pressure from the US.' Is the U.S. Jewish community moving away from Netanyahu? Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not invited to speak at the annual conference of the Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA) for the first time since taking office. The conference, which is being held Sunday in Washington, is one of the main events of the organized U.S. Jewish community. The move indicates the growing division around Netanyahu is also occurring among Jewish organizations in the U.S. In addition, several left-wing Jewish organizations announced that they would boycott this year's conference on the grounds that their participation might be interpreted as an expression of support for the current government's policies in Israel. Among the organizations are the American branch of Peace Now, the Habonim Dror North America, J Street and the New Israel Fund. Instead of Netanyahu, Israel will be represented at the conference by President Isaac Herzog.

Taliban administration officials to attend UN climate conference ...	Afghan Taliban officials will attend a major United Nations climate conference that starts next week, the Afghan Foreign Ministry said on Sunday, the first time they have attended since the former insurgents took power in 2021. The COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan's capital Baku will be among the highest-profile multilateral events attended by Taliban administration officials since they took control in Kabul after 20 years of fighting NATO-backed forces. The U.N. has not allowed the Taliban to take up Afghanistan's seat at the General Assembly, and Afghanistan's government is not formally recognized by U.N. member states, largely due to the Taliban's restrictions on women's education and freedom of movement. Host Azerbaijan invited the Afghan environment agency officials to COP29 as observers, enabling them to 'potentially participate in periphery discussions and potentially hold bilateral meetings,' a diplomatic source familiar with the matter told Reuters.abling them to 'potentially participate in periphery discussions and potentially hold bilateral meetings,' a diplomatic source familiar with the matter told Reuters.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjflohabjl	2024-11-09T19:51:28-08:00	
US, Britain launch raids on Yemeni capital Sanaa, elsewhere	The United States and Britain launched raids on the Yemeni capital Sanaa, the Amran governorate and other areas, Al Masirah TV, the main television news outlet run by the Houthi movement, reported on Sunday. Houthi media and residents said about nine raids had targeted Sanaa, its suburbs and Amran governorate. Iran-aligned Houthi militants have launched attacks on international shipping near Yemen since November last year, in solidarity with the Palestinians in Israel's war with Hamas. The attacks have drawn U.S. and British retaliatory strikes and disrupted global trade as ship owners reroute vessels away from the Red Sea and Suez Canal to sail the longer route around the southern tip of Africa.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bygeo36zjg	2024-11-09T19:48:48-08:00

Public broadcaster Kan says reporter and cameraman were reporting live from Dam Square when crowd of protesters assembled, chanting slogans against Israel; journalists entered nearby store and requested police assistance to return to their hotel safely Two days after the assault on Maccabi Tel Aviv fans in Amsterdam, Israeli public broadcaster Kan reported on Saturday its crew encountered dozens of anti-Israel protesters gathering around them while they were filming. According to Kan, reporter Michal Reshef and cameraman Micha Razov were reporting live from Amsterdam's Dam Square for the Saturday edition on Kan 11 when a crowd of young protesters assembled, chanting slogans against Israel. Kan representatives said that Reshef and Razov packed up their equipment and left the location, but the protesters tailed them. The journalists entered a nearby store and requested police assistance to return to their hotel safely. After a wait in the store, they were escorted by police back to their hotel in a patrol car. Kan News said they are in close communication with the crew and providing assistance as needed. This incident follows a statement from Israel’s National Security Council, which advised that Israelis could move freely around Amsterdam without concern.

The four sins: What drives Israelis to spy for Iran?	In recent months, several Israeli citizens, mostly Jewish, were arrested and charged with contacting Iranian operatives; some were allegedly recruited for sabotage and assassination attempts; investigations aim to uncover what leads Israelis to become agents for their enemy, and it's not just money Natalia started getting worried when she hadn’t heard from her husband Moti for a whole day. All she knew was that he was away on a business trip in Turkey somewhere near the Iranian border and that he wasn’t answering his phone. 'Moti hasn’t been answering for a whole day. He’s not online,' she wrote to a friend who called her to try to calm her down. Natalia updated her friend on the afternoon of Sunday, August 25, 'I’ve found him. He left his phone and went to the border for three days. He’ll only be back at the hotel tomorrow. Such an adventurer.' According to the indictment, however, this 'adventure' of Moti Maman’s involved entering Iran twice and meetings with Iranian intelligence personnel in which they discussed missions to be carried out in Israel, including assassinating Israeli leaders. Maman is a 72-year-old pensioner living with his wife in Ashkelon. He’s originally from Bustan Hagalil where he owns holiday chalets and rental warehouses. Investigations reveal that he had fallen into debt resulting in loans he’d given out, and that he was having trouble providing his new 39-year-old wife Natalia from Belarus with her desired lifestyle of hotels, restaurants and vacations. He'd spent several years living in Turkey’s Samandağ municipality where his interrogators say he was working in the fruit and vegetable trade. This is where he met the Turkish Aslan family, including Andrey and Junayd, with whom he became good friends. In light of his financial situation, in April of this year, he asked them if they had any business ventures to offer him. They invited him to come to Turkey to meet an Iranian tycoon known as Adi. In April, Maman flew to Turkey where he spent a few days with Natalia. Adi, however, didn’t show up. Maman and his wife returned to Cyprus en route to Belarus where Natalia was living at the time. He then received a call from Adi. Adi said to him 'Hi. I’m so sorry. I tried getting to Hatay (district in southern Turkey bordering Syria), but my people in Turkey told me it wasn’t safe. So, come meet my people here. It’s very important. After we meet, we’ll be able to start off big, I promise. No problem. You show up, have the meeting and leave.' Maman responded, 'I believe you. Give me a day or two. I’ll be there.' Maman left Natalia, who traveled alone to Belarus, and he traveled to Turkey. His hosts picked him up and took him to a five-star hotel in a village near the Turkey-Iran border. Adi then, however, informed him that legal restrictions meant he couldn’t leave Iran and that the solution would be for Maman to come to him, inside Iran and that Adi would arrange the entry. So, after a hold-up of several hours at the border, Maman and his entourage entered Iranian territory where they met Adi and another man known as Hajja. The two took Maman to a fancy villa and then to an upmarket hotel, both of which Adi claimed to own. At some stage, Adi asked whether Maman would be willing to carry out missions for the Iranian regime. According to his lawyer, Eyal Besserglick, Maman initially believed this to be a legitimate business meeting. There, in enemy territory, however, he didn’t want to rock the boat and agreed to hear the offer. The investigation reveals that Adi suggested a few 'easy' missions including depositing money and weapons at predetermined locations to be collected by a third party, photographing crowded locations in Israel and making threats against Israeli Arabs opposing the Iranian regime. Maman told them he’d check and get back to them. Late that evening, Maman hid inside a truck and crossed back across the border back into Turkey. He was given $1,300 for the trip. Maman then flew to Belarus and returned to Israel with his wife Natalia. He didn’t report either his visit to Iran or the espionage proposal to Israeli authorities. Why didn’t he report his visit to Iran? Maman’s lawyer, Eyal Besserglick: 'Maman was told that they’d just be doing business. At the meeting, he found himself in an unimaginably difficult situation, fearing for his life. He nevertheless agreed to discuss the missions proposed to him. For decades, he aided the Mossad and Israeli defense authorities and has the evidence to prove it – but he was shunned by them when he needed their help. Having lost faith in the authorities, he didn’t contact them on his own initiative.' According to the indictment, Maman continued conducting conversations with his Turkish friend Andrey and talked to him about the possibilities of business with Adi. Three months later, he asked his wife Natalia to order plane tickets to the Turkish city of Van adjacent to the Iranian border. Natalia wasn’t enthralled by the idea: Interrogators: Why didn’t you want him to fly to Van? What’s dangerous about it? Natalia: 'I thought he was doing business by the Iranian border and that it was illegal because it’s connected to Iran, a country that’s Israel’s enemy. I was afraid he’d be arrested or that they’d kill him.' Interrogators: If you understood how problematic it was to wander around there, why did you buy him the tickets? Natalia: 'What, am I his boss? Moti is very stubborn and I did what he asked me to do. He’s my husband.' On Friday, August 23, Maman once again returned to the hotel in the Turkish village near the Iranian border. Natalia wrote to him 'Shabbat Shalom my dearest husband. Lotz of luck tomorrow.' Maman responded 'Lots.' Natalia responded 'Amen.' Early the following morning, Maman got into the back of a truck and lay down on a 'bed.' Why did he agree to go to Iran again? 'Money blinds the discerning and perverts the words of the righteous,' Maman told Supt. Maor Goren in the interrogation. 'I’m under a lot of pressure. I’m dying to settle a few of my debts.' Two Iranian intelligence personnel were waiting for him in Adi’s villa. This time, the proposals were much more targeted: Killing key figures in Israel, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The four sins Maman isn’t alone. In recent months, no less than seven separate incidents of Israelis communicating with foreign agents operated by Iran have been made public. So far, 20 people have been charged, 14 with the most severe clauses on Israel’s law books: Aiding the enemy at times of war - a crime punishable by life sentence or execution. Over the past weeks, we’ve looked into these cases and talked to interrogators, experts, prosecutors and defense attorneys. We asked them the most important questions: What motivates Israelis, almost all of whom hold blue ID cards, mainly Jewish, to make contact with Israel’s bitterest enemy, and in the worst cases, become agents in their service? 'Firstly – money,' said Supt. Goren, a security division commander at Israel’s Unit of International Crime Investigations at Lahav 443 in charge of these investigations. 'Some are people who don’t care about the country so much, people with no sense of affiliation or commitment to the state.' Money is indeed an important and the chief motive for most of the accused – but certainly not the only one. 'The CIA conducted a 12-year study of dozens of traitors,' says Dr. Ilan Diamant, clinical psychologist and defense establishment alumnus. 'They found four basic motives for treason: Money, deterioration, ego and ideology.' These are the four sins likely to lead a person to commit treason against their country. In many cases it’s not just one single 'sin,' but rather the four sins interconnecting: monetary temptation can meet ideological justification. A sophisticated handler can stage by stage, exploit a spy’s ego to cause him to deteriorate to carry out evermore serious actions. 'The CIA says that there are no happy traitors. For all of them, it’s a solution to historic emotional problems,' says Dr. Diamant who, with organizational psychologist Shlomo Peled, former commander of one of the defense organizations, recently published 'Treason in the Kingdom of Secrets: A Journey into the Psyches of Spies Who Betrayed Their Country' (Matar Press). Diamant: 'Without knowing the accused parties, you can’t really diagnose them, but based on the indictments, one can give a general estimate based on our professional knowledge of at-risk groups.' Who are the people usually in these at-risk groups? 'People who reach a point of despair, with a background of personality and family problems. They’re generally impulsive and not fully mature. Easy money is a big temptation for them, and they don’t factor in what it all means. Some are addicted to breaching trust, their basis being lies and deception. In terms of ego, many are narcissists, with an incessant need for attention and whose self-esteem demands external affirmation – which this kind of activity provides. ‘I’m worth something. I’m of value. They need me’.' Those committing these 'four sins' of money, deterioration, ego and ideology may one day find themselves in handcuffs in a Shin Bet or a police interrogation room facing serious charges. This has been the fate of 20 Israelis accused in recent months of communicating with a foreign agent – or of actually working for the Islamic Republic of Iran. First sin: Money The first sin, money, was certainly a central component in Moti Maman’s motives. When he got to his second visit to Iran beyond the border in that concealed compartment in the truck, the Iranian businessman Adi was waiting for him along with Hajja, who seemed to hold some kind of security position. According to investigation material, they got into a brand-new Suzuki jeep and set off. While driving, Adi chatted to Maman in English about business plans and working for his country. The meeting’s subject matter was not concealed. Adi said that two intelligence personnel would be coming to the villa to meet Maman, with an 'open check' for operations in revenge for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil. Maman agreed to discuss the mission, but laid down certain conditions for each operation: $1 million upfront. At the villa, Maman was welcomed with a fancy banquet. Half an hour later, the two arrived. 'One with a wig, the other with a briefcase,' Maman told his interrogators. Adi translated to and from English and Persian. The agent with the wig was particularly knowledgeable and even spoke a little Hebrew. The conversation quickly got to the point. Maman said, 'I first want a million dollars.' The agents talked of lower figures, of a few hundred thousand dollars, for a shooting. As candidates, the Iranians offered: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Maman, however, said that the security around these individuals was too high. At this point, the agent with the wig asked him. 'Do you know what’s in Ra’anana?' meaning the home of former prime minister Naftali Bennet. 'I know what’s in Ra’anana,' replied Maman. 'He’s former, so his security has to be lower,' said the Iranian. Negotiations carried on into the evening, but Maman refused to operate for less than $1 million. The meeting wrapped up with no agreement. We’ll soon get back to that meeting and what happened next. The 'first sin,' money, was apparently the primary motive in the case of 35-year-old Vladimir Verhovsky who made Aliyah from Ukraine eight years ago, and has since managed to get involved in criminal activity and has been sentenced to community service. His financial situation wasn’t promising, so when 'Eli' contacted him by Telegram presenting himself as an Israeli living in Canada, he was quickly tempted to carry out missions in exchange for money transferred to him in digital currency. It started with spray-painting graffiti in Tel Aviv reading things like 'Netanyahu=Hitler.' Verhovsky was asked to photograph demonstrators in Tel Aviv in an effort to recruit them. As the Iranians saw Verhovsky cooperating, they stepped up a gear. According to the indictment, Verhovsky was asked to collect a gun from a hiding place and, with it, murder an Israeli scientist for $100,000, and that he would be spirited away to Russia. Verhovsky reached the Tel Aviv address he had been given and started looking for the scientist. Investigation materials reveal that he asked people, showed them a picture and knocked on the scientist’s door - but couldn’t find him. The Iranian handlers, who had meanwhile recruited several networks inside Israel, assigned intelligence gathering to another cell. 'The cells are isolated from one another, each acting separately,' says Supt. Goren. 'But sometimes, missions overlap and they’ll ask someone to hide petrol or equipment for someone else.' In Verhovsky’s case, he was told that there was another cell that would prepare the mission for hi, and asked him to pick up the gun and wait for instructions. He went to pick up the gun that had been hidden for him in a field in Modi'in. 'Wait a moment,' he told the taxi driver and came back a few minutes later with a bag containing a gun, a magazine and 15 bullets. Upon returning home that day, he was arrested by the Shin Bet. The Public Defender’s Office representing Verhovsky has not responded. Money was the central component in the case of 30-year-old Vladislav (Vlad) Victorsson from Ramat Gan, formerly convicted of sexual offenses involving minors and who was also recruited over Telegram. An Iranian handler calling himself Mari Hossi contacted him offering him several operations and Victorsson agreed. He brought his 18-year-old partner on board and, according to the indictment, set out on his first operation in September. This involved setting cars on fire for $500 each and leaving anti-Netanyahu fliers at the scene. He was then asked to murder someone for $100,000 and was promised that he and his partner would be smuggled to Russia. Victorsson started trying to get hold of a gun, but the two were arrested the following day. The Public Defender’s Office representing Victorsson has not responded. 'The moment an individual with low self-esteem has a secret, that self-esteem suddenly shoots up,' says Peled. 'A person who sees themselves as a doormat is suddenly playing in the big leagues. He’s a player between states. The recruiters know all about this need, and employ a method known as ‘deterioration.'' Second sin: Deterioration This is a time-honored method used to handle agents. The idea is to initially give the agent small, simple, invariably worthless missions to carry out. 'These are all kinds of minor missions that don’t necessarily need to be conducted for operational purposes,' explains Diamant. 'But they’re designed to test the object’s capabilities, consequently reinforcing the manly side and deconstructing caution and braking mechanisms.' Elimelech Stern, a 22-year-old Vishnitz Hassid from Bet Shemesh, is possibly the furthest thing from a person who might be involved in espionage. According to the indictment against him, his deterioration was almost a textbook case. It started with a mission of putting up posters in the street of bloodstained hands calling to protest the killing of children, reading 'Let’s stand on the right side of history.' Stern did it, his lawyer claims, without knowing that he was dealing with an Iranian agent. After making it through this stage, Stern was assigned a larger mission: setting fire to a forest next to Jerusalem’s Valley of the Holy Cross. 'They’ve elevated my rank to that of a fully-fledged member,' he wrote to Yonatan, the man for whom he put up the posters. 'I’m talking straight to the boss,' Yonatan replied. Stern later added, 'I just don’t understand why they’re doing this.' Yonatan responded 'Because they’re anti-Israel. Clearly.' Stern, apparently regarding himself as having stepped up a rank, himself became a handler and recruited Netanel, who he found in a jobseekers’ Telegram group. 'There’s now a mission to set off a fire, and that’s a bit scary. You need a lot of courage.' Netanel avoided carrying out the mission, and Stern also ultimately refused. He also didn’t carry out more serious missions for fear of being caught and made do with picking up a secure cellphone and burying money via his operatives. Stern’s lawyer, Adv. Akiva Meir, claims there to be no connection between his client and the other incidents. 'Stern didn’t know he who was dealing with, innocently believing this to be some kind of left-wing anarchist wanting to make their voice heard. Stern refused to carry out any mission that is forbidden, or that he regarded as unethical. He wasn’t aware that he was part of widescale Iranian recruitment efforts.' Moti Maman, on the other hand, understood exactly what his handler wanted of him, but claimed in his interrogation that he didn’t intend to do anything, just take the money and disappear. The Iranian agents, however, were sure to convey a veiled message. According to the indictment, following the meeting at the villa in which he demanded $1 million upfront prior to the operation, he stayed the night at the fancy hotel, returning the next day to the villa. In this meeting, the Iranians once again proposed a series of possible missions, including assassinations of Israeli Arabs who had received money from Iran, and who had not carried out the missions. Diamant says, 'When agents talk about assassinating Arabs, what they’re doing is sending a warning message: Look what happens to those who don’t cooperate with us.' Peled explains that this is also part of the deterioration method. 'This is how they push you further and further down into the tunnel. You have no way out. You’ll either fall into Iranian hands or get caught by the Shin Bet.' In Maman’s case, it was the latter. He received €5,000 for the meeting, came back to Israel and was then arrested here. Adv. Besserglick, why did he reenter Iran? 'The second time, he was supposed to meet a businessman about fruit, vegetable and spice ventures in Turkey. He waited there for two days. This time, the contact misled him, telling him he couldn’t get to Turkey, and so found himself again at a meeting point across the border. He certainly made an error of judgment in agreeing to the new meeting point across the border. He couldn’t have expected, or known, that they would ask him to do things to which he wouldn’t agree or that the individuals brought to the meeting would be there. The indictment states otherwise. Following his arrest, Maman cooperated completely with security authorities and this cooperation has helped security authorities.' Third sin: Ego Ego is possibly the most complex of them all. There are people who, after years of mundane and tiresome lives in low-level jobs, are offered the chance of becoming an agent and, all of a sudden, they finally feel important. Some people’s egos are nourished by the 'mind games' with their handlers. Eden Debs, a 30-year-old psychology student from Ramat Gan, played a double-edged game with his Iranian handlers for the duration of most of their communication. He was contacted over Telegram by an Iranian handler offering him the chance to make money by putting up posters in the street. This is known in the Shin Bet as 'Spray and Pray'. A huge number of messages are sent out to Israelis across social media, hoping that as many as possible will respond. 'In most cases, it’s a general message like 'Cast your bread upon the waters,' says Adi Carmi, senior Shin Bet official. 'There are links on websites and bots on social media generating temptations, such as making easy money. As soon as the connection is made, the Iranian handler is activated and he starts developing the relationship.' According to the indictment, following negotiations regarding the payment amount, 50 posters for NIS 2,500, Debs put up posters, took pictures and sent the photographs to his handlers, and then took them down. He referred the Iranian handler to another Telegram account with lots of members, that he also owns, i.e., the other profile was also run by Debs. 'These manipulations provide the operative further justification for his action - as if he’s not committing treason, but rather making fun of the handler,' says Diamant. 'It also reinforces his ego. He says to himself, ‘You think you’re handling me, but actually, I’m playing you.' As soon as the stops are gone and you’re in the process of treason, you’ve no way out.' According to the incitement, the Iranian agent recognized Deb’s capabilities and asked him to add fake followers to his 'The People’s Army' Telegram group to be used for recruiting further agents. Debs complied, adding a further 2,000 followers to the group, providing greater exposure. Iranian agents posted messages along the lines of 'Military coup is the only way to save the country. Join us before it’s too late. Message us if you want to cooperate with us and make some money.' Debs received $150 in digital currency. The Iranians got a group that thousands of potential recruits could join. But Deb’s games with the Iranians didn’t end there. At some stage, he was asked to make threats against a senior defense official. The mission was to decapitate a doll of a sheep, paint it red and place it in a box beside a knife outside the home of the defense official. Debs asked his mother to buy a toy sheep. He removed the head and placed it in a box outside his father’s home and sent a video of it to the handler as if it was outside the home of the defense official. 'This sense of adventure obscures what lies beneath, be it despair, pessimism, loneliness or depression,' says Diamant. 'When they’re performing missions, they less feel everything that’s bothering them, and get a different sensation – one of competence and self-esteem.' When asked to set a car on fire, Debs downloaded from the Internet a video clip of a car on fire and sent it to his handler. He turned down more complex missions that were hard to fake. According to the indictment, he received $12,000 and quite a bit of action. 'This sense of adventure obscures what lies beneath, be it despair, pessimism, loneliness or depression,' says Diamant. 'When they’re performing missions, they less feel everything that’s bothering them, and get a different sensation – one of competence and self-esteem.' Debs isn’t represented by an attorney at this stage. At the time of his arrest, his then-attorney claimed, 'The accused, in fact, deceived the foreign agent, defrauded him to get money out of him for being Iranian. When the court is exposed to all the evidence, like myself, it will understand that a mountain has been made out of a molehill.' Moti Maman’s interrogation reveals that, for him too, ego played no small part and that his handler seems to have recognized this. At the end of the second meeting in the villa in Iran, as mentioned, a night in Adi’s hotel was ordered for him where he was allotted an entire floor complete with waiters and staff serving his every desire. 'These displays constitute a very important component for the ego,' says Diamant. 'He was given respect. They were showing him that he could trust them.' When arrested upon his return to Israel, his ego crashed into reality. 'Do you know who we are?' Shin Bet personnel asked him at Ben Gurion Airport. 'I don’t give a f**k who you are,' replied Maman. As mentioned, in his interrogation, Maman claimed to have acted for the Mossad in the past, and so derided the Shin Bet personnel arresting him. 'The whites have ruined the country,' he said. 'For the Shin Bet, arresting someone like me on the right side of the political map, who’s contributed to the country’s security their whole life rather than arresting traitors like Ami Ayalon, Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert, is more important.' His attorney, Besserglick claims that he has in his possession proof that he had aided Israeli state security. We asked Supt. Goren about Maman’s security history. 'BS,' he says. 'It’s been checked out and dismissed.' In the Lahav 433 interrogation cell, Supt. Goren asked him what would have happened had he really received the $1 million from the Iranians. 'I don’t know what would have happened if they’d have given me the money. A million bucks. What would you do?' replied Maman. 'We’re only human.' Fourth sin: Ideology Ideology is among the world’s greatest motives for recruiting agents. An agent sharing the same ideology as his handler will need much less coaxing. Ideology was a dominant component in the case of the most recent network caught. Seven members of a cell from East Jerusalem’s Bet Zafafa - six of whom are Israeli citizens - were recently indicted. According to the indictment, 23-year-old cell leader Rami Alian was contacted via Telegram by a profile named The Timon. Here too, initial missions included putting up protest posters and spray-painting graffiti. The deterioration, however, was quick. Alian, it’s claimed, recruited a friend from the neighborhood and, together, they set cars on fire for NIS 4,000 ($1080) in digital currency. After carrying out this mission, the handler presented himself to Alian as a 38-year-old Shi’ite Muslim working for the Iranian Intelligence Ministry. Alian shared these details with his friends, adding that the great goal toward which they would be assisting was the destruction of the State of Israel. With ideological persuasion of the mission’s virtue, the Iranian handler proposed the next stage of assassinating a 'nuclear scientist at the Weizmann Institute' for NIS 200,000 ($54,000). Alian procured a Glock pistol and started checking out the addresses his Iranian handler had given him. The scientist apparently lived at one of the addresses. He brought more friends on board and built up a cell that went to the Weizmann Institute at midnight but was stopped by security. The group later found the scientist’s home, took photos and sent them to the Iranian handler. According to the indictment, Alian thought the pistol wasn’t the right weapon for the job, so paid a weapons dealer NIS 13,500 ($3,645) for a bomb. At this stage, Alian was arrested by the Shin Bet along with the entire cell. The Public Defenders Office has not responded. Lack of ideology can also play a part in the recruitment of agents. The Shin Bet describes it as 'low attachment to the state.' Apparently, this is what helped the Iranians recruit their most effective network so far of Haifa and Nof Hagalil residents, including two minors, all immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Over a two-year period, they carried out over 600 missions inside Israel. Their handlers equipped the cell with maps of military bases and infrastructure facilities and trained them how to gather intelligence without getting caught. Their target banks included military bases and infrastructure facilities that were targets for the Iranian missile attacks. According to the indictment, following the Iranian attack in April, the cell members were even sent to inspect the damage the missiles had caused at IAF bases. The cell was headed by 43-year-old Aziz Nisanov from Haifa who had made Aliyah from Azerbaijan in the 1990s. Aziz worked unloading containers at ports, but the company closed down two years ago and he ran into financial difficulties. In his time of need, he contacted a friend living in Azerbaijan, Iran’s northern neighbor. According to the investigation, Aziz’s Azerbaijani friend put him in touch with an individual named Elkhan Agayev, who was in contact with Iran and could help provide him with financial assistance in exchange for carrying out missions. Nisanov accepted the offer. As the relationship took shape, Nisanov recruited, to the ever-increasing missions, acquaintances also originally from the Soviet Union. Apparently, unlike most Olim from the Soviet Union, this group had not integrated into Israeli society and had kept themselves separate. At this stage, communication was transferred directly to Elkhan and the man presenting himself as his Iranian commander, a handler known as 'Orkhan.' 'In this case,' says Supt. Goren, 'the handler mapped out Israel’s military and strategic installations from north to south, and transferred them to the target bank via an encrypted app. They gave a nickname to each target, and would move over to a different encrypted app to run these missions.' What were the missions? 'Taking stills photos and videos, giving precise GPS locations, filming routine and security arrangements (at sensitive sites).' And did they manage to reach all these strategic points? 'They didn’t get inside any facility. But they found good vantage points – very tall buildings or adjacent hills - from which they filmed. They were asked to purchase appropriate equipment such as mobile phones, laptops, cameras, tripods, etc. They were even asked to buy a jeep and took an offroad driving course to get to various locations in the north and south that are hard to reach.' 'They got lots of attention from their handlers,' says a State Attorney source. 'It reinforced their self-esteem to the point that they suggested missions themselves.' According to a defense establishment official, during one of their tours in the north, they encountered the IDF’s Sky Dew observation balloon. Without knowing what this balloon does exactly, they filmed it and sent it to the Iranians. Last May, the balloon was attacked by Hezbollah. Last April, the Iranians tried sending this cell to carry out an assignment. The target was a female scientist dealing with the Iranian issue. Orkhan sent Nisanov her picture and asked him to find out details about her. Nisanov went to the university where she taught but was stopped at the gate by security. Oh, and it’s been a decade since the scientist herself taught at this university. It's unclear how much intelligence damage has been caused by the cell. Some of the material they filmed is freely available to anyone with Internet access. 'But,' they say at the State Attorney’s office, 'they also took pictures of flight training and aircraft armament at a proximity no Iranian could reach.' The Public Defender's Office, representing Nisanov has not responded. Shlomo Peled, the picture of the accused in all shades – Haredi, a young secular guy, a pensioner, Israeli Arabs, Olim from the former Soviet Union – raises the possibility that anyone could actually be a spy. Peled: 'No. We’re actually saying the very opposite. Let’s not get too paranoid. Spies and traitors are people in certain at-risk groups, and most people aren’t there. Iranian motivation has now met technology allowing them to easily reach lots of people. So yes, we shouldn’t ignore it, and definitely not sweep under the rug or hide it. On the other hand, we don’t need to build it up. It’s not COVID and there’s no pandemic.'

US officials signal potential for Lebanon agreement, hostage deal	U.S. officials told Ynet on Saturday they believe chances are rising for a mediated agreement in Lebanon led by President Biden’s envoy Amos Hochstein, with President-elect Donald Trump’s encouragement. Efforts are underway to negotiate a smaller-scale hostage deal, the officials said. Qatar’s statement that mediation efforts are paused but not abandoned was reportedly meant to increase pressure on Hamas, as Qatar seeks to project an image of firmness ahead of Trump’s anticipated involvement. Officials added that it is unlikely the Biden administration will impose an arms embargo on Israel in its remaining term.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1lcwu6zye	2024-11-09T12:46:02-08:00

Israel pushes back on reports of Qatar halting Hamas mediation	Qatar reportedly orders Hamas to close offices, but Hamas insider says unclear if leaders will be expelled; Israeli officials call Doha’s decision to halt mediation 'reversible'; diplomatic sources say Qatar will only engage if talks become serious Israeli officials on Saturday downplayed reports from major international news agencies that Qatar has ceased its mediation between Israel and Hamas, asserting that the decision is 'reversible.' Diplomats cited in the reports said Doha had decided to suspend its mediation role until both parties 'demonstrate a sincere willingness to return to the negotiating table.' However, Israeli sources confirmed that senior officials had been informed of Qatar’s move, reportedly driven by U.S. pressure, to demand that senior Hamas figures leave the country. Qatar has served as a mediator in indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas, alongside Egypt and the United States, for the past 13 months. Hamas officials, speaking to Arab media and AFP, denied they had been ordered to leave Qatar but acknowledged that their offices may soon be shut down. For now, Hamas operations are set to continue from Doha, though senior Hamas officials reportedly received a message indicating their office closures were imminent. An insider close to a senior Hamas leader told Ynet that 'the decision by Qatar came under massive pressure from the U.S.' Israel welcomed Qatar’s decision to expel Hamas leaders, a long-sought goal by both Jerusalem and Washington. 'Hamas is a murderous terrorist organization that should be pursued worldwide, not offered sanctuary in any country,' a senior Israeli official said, adding that Qatar’s expulsion of Hamas leaders logically diminishes its role as mediator. 'Once they expel Hamas leaders, there is no further advantage in Qatar’s mediation.' A government source further remarked that 'all parties now recognize that key decisions in negotiations lie with Israel and Hamas, not with mediators, so the impact is limited.' The official noted that, despite Qatar’s mediation attempts, no agreements had been reached. He added that Hamas leaders had enjoyed 'luxury hotels while continuing to orchestrate terror within an axis that includes Iran and Hezbollah.'

Israel says Amsterdam violence calmed, advises ongoing vigilance	National Security Council says violence following Maccabi Tel Aviv's match in Amsterdam has subsided; Netherlands remains under Level 2 advisory, urging Israelis to exercise caution, avoid visible Israeli symbols and stay vigilant The National Security Council (NSC) updated its travel advisory on Saturday, saying that security officials now assess the wave of violence that followed Thursday’s Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer match in Amsterdam has subsided. 'There is no reason to prevent Israelis from moving around the city,' according to a statement. However, the NSC cautioned that the Netherlands remains under a Level 2 travel advisory, recommending Israelis exercise heightened caution, minimize visible Israeli symbols and stay vigilant for any unusual events amid ongoing sensitivities in Amsterdam. The NSC advised Israeli travelers to contact local security forces immediately in the event of any incident and to also notify the NSC’s travel advisory center at +972-2-6667444. In Amsterdam, local authorities have imposed fines for public disorder on 40 suspects, 10 of whom face further charges, including vandalism. Judges are examining whether the violence was premeditated, with court officials saying, 'more arrests are expected.' The violence erupted after Maccabi Tel Aviv’s Europa League match against Ajax, when pro-Palestinian groups targeted Israeli fans near the Johan Cruyff Arena, attacking dozens of fans in what was described as one of Amsterdam's most violent nights in recent memory. Video footage circulating online showed attackers checking passports, physically assaulting those they identified as Israeli and threatening fans until they repeated 'Free Palestine.' Amsterdam police arrested 62 people suspected of assault during attempts to restore order, with four remaining in custody on public violence charges. Police later identified a 26-year-old suspect from security footage, who was arrested on Friday. A police spokesperson told the New York Times that the release of some does not mean they are no longer suspects, and additional arrests may follow, adding that charges have yet to be filed. Official reports indicate five Israelis were hospitalized after the attacks but were later discharged. Another 20 suffered minor injuries, with eight receiving treatment at Sheba Medical Center in Israel upon their return and subsequently being released.

Cell towers and water lines: A closer look at Israel’s expanding ...	As military focus shifts to Lebanon, the Netzarim Corridor has quietly expanded into a 22 square-mile Israeli enclave, lined with IDF posts and flags, echoing Gaza’s pre-2005 configuration Along the Netzarim Corridor, Israeli flags line a central road extending westward to a large military outpost on the Mediterranean coast, south of Gaza’s Sheikh Ijlin district. The IDF has transformed this outpost into a fully operational base with temporary detention facilities, interrogation rooms and permanent quarters for a brigade command and combat units. Trenches are being dug around the complex to fortify it as construction crews and engineering officers work to complete the fortifications. The critical part of this base lies between it and the coast: an advanced coastal checkpoint through which, the military hopes, a large portion of the Palestinian population will soon pass southward within Gaza as pressure mounts on the Jabaliya area. This base is part of Israel's expanding hold in Gaza, marking a significant phase in the ongoing ground campaign. The Netzarim corridor is currently held by two combined IDF reserve brigades, supporting both infantry and armor divisions. These units differ from the regular defensive brigades stationed along Gaza’s southern border in Israel’s western Negev, where Hamas terrorists launched their deadly October 7 attack. The current brigades resemble those that once maintained Israel’s hold over Gaza before the 2005 disengagement. Further south, another brigade holds the Philadelphi Corridor between Rafah and the Sinai, a strip Israel captured in May. Over recent months, the Netzarim corridor has expanded to cover approximately 56 square kilometers (22 square miles), forming an Israeli military enclave at the heart of northern Gaza. Stretched along an eight-kilometer (five-mile) axis from the Be'eri region to the sea, this corridor is the result of the IDF 36th Division’s ground incursion a year ago to secure the area as a potential leverage point in hostage negotiations. The proposal, initially positioned as a bargaining tool, suggested Israel would withdraw and allow one million displaced Gazans to return to their homes if Hamas released roughly 100 hostages. However, negotiations have stalled repeatedly, with no resolution in sight. According to IDF sources, two trends have emerged following Israel’s ground incursion into southern Lebanon, as Gaza becomes a secondary front. First, Israel’s territorial control within Gaza is steadily expanding, with a similar plan reportedly under development for the Philadelphi Corridor. Second, government efforts to resolve the hostage crisis have slowed, leaving the fate of the hostages uncertain. Intelligence briefings presented to Israel’s Security Cabinet warn that the hostages’ conditions worsen by the week, with Hamas reportedly prepared to execute them if IDF forces advance on their positions. Without renewed negotiations, officials fear the crisis will end in tragedy. Right-wing ministers, who oppose prisoner releases in exchange for hostages, view this outcome as inevitable. This scenario, they argue, would naturally resolve the hostage issue and could strengthen Israel’s resolve to retain its current foothold in Gaza. Israeli leaders and right-wing lawmakers, some openly advocating the establishment of new settlements in Gaza, maintain that retaining control over this newly claimed territory is essential. As public anger would likely focus on Hamas, government officials anticipate that calls for withdrawal would diminish, solidifying Israel's extended presence in Gaza. The withdrawal order is ready At the beginning of the war, the border checkpoint here was called 'Crossing 96.' Once the IDF realized that the Netzarim Corridor would remain under Israeli control, it established 'Checkpoint 3' (Point 3), with a small team to monitor the movement of forces in and out of the corridor. Today, it has developed into 'Terminal 3,' a large, organized military base at the edge of Be’eri Forest, currently in advanced stages of construction. Private vehicles can no longer enter Gaza from this area, nor can anyone gain unauthorized entry by posing as reserve soldiers, as was previously possible. Security infrastructure includes checkpoint gates with staffed booths, three inspection points at the entrance corridor, and coordination between the Gaza Division and Netzarim Division (now the 252nd Reserve Division). Open-sided Humvees, along with armored Defender jeeps (known as 'David' vehicles used primarily in security operations in the West Bank), regularly enter and exit, joined by a steady flow of construction trucks, cranes and drills in what looks like a major highway. The westernmost checkpoint within Terminal 3 is still known as Crossing 96, situated along the border fence and now divided into two parts: one entrance for light vehicles and trucks, and another for armored vehicles such as tanks and APCs several hundred feet away. Crossing 96 is operated by a joint infantry and armor unit. The first IDF post operates smoothly, aptly named 'The Cement Plant' after the IDF cement plant that facilitated the large-scale engineering work establishing the corridor and rebuilding the border barrier damaged at the war’s outset. Previously, this area was home to a Palestinian grain facility, as these fields—bordering Gaza’s main landfill and close to Israel—were farmed by Palestinians until October 7, interspersed with Hamas positions. In the post’s yard, surrounded by concrete Jersey barriers and earth embankments, stands a grill frequently used by reservists. Soldiers here enjoy fortified and comfortable sleeping quarters in modular containers, a shaded smoking and relaxation area and proper shower and restroom facilities that have replaced the portable toilets used initially. Overall, the post has the feel of a small, permanent base that’s pleasant to stay in. The IDF has installed a new water line from Israel, and soldiers’ cell phones remain fully operational. There’s no longer a need to leave devices behind or set them to airplane mode upon entry, as the IDF installed a dedicated cell tower in the corridor, allowing soldiers to stay in touch with family without needing to climb onto rooftops to reach signal. From the post, the northern end of the corridor is fully visible—completely exposed, with hundreds of buildings that the IDF flattened to expand the area up to the outskirts of Gaza City neighborhoods such as Zeitoun and Sabra. 'The operational tension has eased here a bit, so I treat soldiers returning from missions with various snacks, like these sfinge,' says Dotan Ben-Tovim, a 54-year-old building engineer from Ramat Gan and a seasoned fighter, as he flips the deep-fried doughnuts in sizzling oil. In line with the relaxed atmosphere, soldiers on base wear partial uniforms, forgoing helmets and body armor typically worn during the early months. They dress casually, wearing sports clothes and only gear up in full protective equipment when heading out on operational activity. Driving along the Netzarim Corridor, not a single tank is visible. The IDF’s armored units are dispersed across a security and maintenance zone, which has now expanded to seven or eight kilometers wide. Initially, IDF plans spoke of widening the corridor by just one to two kilometers from the main route. The road itself will soon be repaved with asphalt in preparation for the IDF's second winter in Gaza. Posts along the corridor are of two primary types: structures built by the IDF, mainly modular containers and military facilities, or repurposed Gazan buildings previously used for other functions but now adapted by the IDF as soldier posts. One such post is a large Palestinian public building that stands out in the area. 'Everything here is modular and removable,' say IDF sources. 'Most of these structures can be loaded onto trucks and engineering vehicles and quickly dismantled.' The Southern Command has strict orders to disassemble everything and fully withdraw to Israeli territory if necessary. Between posts along the dual-lane corridor, the IDF is conducting extensive drilling operations to ensure no cross-border tunnels run beneath the route. Led by the 252nd Division’s engineering battalion and involving civilian contractors, this project is designed to prevent potential explosive traps or exit points for attackers from below. The latest tunnel under the route was discovered in late October, more than 20 meters (65 feet) deep; it has been mapped and will be destroyed. Meanwhile, the search drill campaign is being expanded throughout the corridor’s area. A few months ago, during the latest clash in the region, a Hamas cell killed an IDF soldier stationed at a corridor post, likely with tunnel support. Hamas terrorists can potentially dig tunnels from Gaza City, located only a few miles away. In response, the IDF is determined to neutralize this threat. At the start of the year, many Gazans approached IDF posts, primarily from south to north, but were either fired upon or pushed back. Hamas also sent drugged Gazans toward IDF positions to gauge the soldiers' responses. These incidents have since declined, as has the surge of hundreds of Gazans—some armed—toward the corridor posts during the Iranian offensive on October 1, which was forcefully halted and has not been repeated. IDF forces occasionally receive alerts of potential Hamas raids on the corridor's forward posts, often small-scale guerrilla units. Though mortar and rocket fire on the positions still occurs, it is much less frequent, with entire weeks passing peacefully at some posts. When necessary, loudspeakers connected to detection sensors warn of incoming fire. Currently, the IDF is permitting and even encouraging the roughly 300,000 Gazans remaining in the northern region to cross south, though Hamas actively prevents this, and many Gazans prefer to remain in the ruins and shelters around Gaza City. Recently, Hamas established a tent compound not far from the port, just a few miles west of the corridor. The IDF is preparing its large coastal post to screen the tens of thousands it hopes will soon cross southward—a movement the military anticipates will increase with the ground incursion's expansion from Jabaliya into additional areas and neighborhoods within Gaza itself. The coastal base is equipped with interrogation rooms, temporary detention enclosures and inspection stations to minimize direct interaction between soldiers and Gazans. Erez East, Erez West The second checkpoint in the Netzarim Corridor lies on Gaza's internal north-south route, referred to by the IDF as 'Tenzer' and by Gazans as Salah al-Din. Currently, it is unmanned by soldiers and staffed only when needed to coordinate the transfer of sick or wounded Gazans with Israeli approval across both sides of the Palestinian enclave. The checkpoint area is surrounded by concrete barriers and fences, Israeli flags and a beginning stretch of small paving stones for easier westward travel. Earlier this year, when I crossed this position with an IDF unit, it was encircled by Gazan structures that soldiers used as temporary posts. Today, these buildings—some three or four stories high—are entirely flattened. The maintenance and expansion of the Netzarim territory have been enabled through Israel’s efforts to secure international legitimacy, especially from the United States, which occasionally issues rebukes or threats but takes no further action. Through the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the IDF regularly escorts foreign journalists to witness and document the hundreds of aid trucks Israel allows into Gaza carrying food, water, fuel and medical supplies, including to northern Gaza. This aid flows from the newly expanded Erez Crossing, which now includes two terminals: Erez East and Erez West. This aid ultimately reaches Hamas, which exerts control over the population and regroups militarily despite consistent blows from the IDF. As a result, Israel is facilitating two core conditions: sustaining Hamas as a weakened asset that nonetheless retains control over Gaza’s civilian population, with surviving commanders still active, even in Jabaliya and northern Gaza; and expanding Israeli-held territories in Gaza without advancing a deal for hostages. Southern Command has not received any instructions to launch U.S.-contracted companies to distribute food directly to Gazans rather than through Hamas, an idea dismissed by commanders leading operations against Hamas as nothing more than a rumor. 'We’ve heard nothing about it, nor have we been instructed to prepare for such a possibility,' one commander said. 'For now, we’re broadening humanitarian supply lines, though it’s difficult to prevent Hamas from intercepting the aid, as they frequently seize trucks post-unloading and threaten the lives of Gazan drivers.' Patterns of combat in the Netzarim Corridor have also solidified over the months: Hamas continuously attempts to harass IDF battalion raids that chip away at Palestinian territory at the corridor’s periphery, with recent operations focused mainly in the Nuseirat area. Hamas, in turn, exploits the static nature of activity in Netzarim by deploying snipers. 'The terrorists here operate guerrilla-style, planting explosives and fleeing in an effort to harm our forces,' described Col. Yonatan Meir, commander of the 179th Brigade, one of the two brigades active in the corridor in recent weeks. 'We’re working around the clock. The corridor hinders Hamas’ ability to regroup and makes it harder for them to recover. My reservist troops have been here for ten months, and we’re doing our best to set them a stable and manageable schedule.' Expansion efforts are not limited to the Netzarim Corridor. For the first time since the 2005 disengagement, the IDF is reestablishing the Kissufim Crossing to create an additional facility for the transfer of goods (and forces if necessary) to Palestinians in central Gaza. Moreover, plans are moving forward to replicate the Netzarim Corridor model along the Philadelphi Corridor, which is gradually expanding and taking shape in southern Gaza, reaching toward the historic Gush Katif and the edges of Rafah.

Qatar to pull out of Gaza cease-fire mediation, source says	Official says Doha suspends mediation efforts until Israel and Hamas 'demonstrate a sincere willingness to return to the negotiating table'; Israeli officials welcome Qatar's decision to expel Hamas leaders Qatar will stop trying to mediate a Gaza cease-fire deal until Hamas and Israel 'demonstrate a sincere willingness to return to the negotiating table,' an official briefed on the matter told Reuters on Saturday. The Gulf country has also concluded that Hamas' political office in Doha 'no longer serves its purpose,' the official added. The move marks the biggest setback in efforts to reach a cease-fire since Hamas triggered the Gaza war by attacking Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. 'The Qataris have said since the start of the conflict that they can only mediate when both parties demonstrate a genuine interest in finding a resolution,' the official said, adding that Qatar had notified Hamas, Israel and the U.S. administration of its decision. Israeli officials welcomed Qatar's decision to expel Hamas leaders. 'Hamas is a murderous terrorist organization that should be pursued worldwide, not offered sanctuary in any country,' a senior Israeli official said, adding that Qatar’s expulsion of Hamas leaders logically diminishes its role as mediator. 'Once they expel Hamas leaders, there is no further advantage in Qatar’s mediation.' The move comes just a day after a Reuters report indicating that Qatar relayed a message to Hamas leaders at the request of the U.S. last week, warning that the presence of the organization in Doha 'should no longer be welcome,' according to a senior U.S. official. U.S. and Qatari officials told CNN that Doha has effectively agreed in recent weeks to the American demand to remove Hamas from its territory due to prolonged, unsuccessful efforts to secure a hostage exchange agreement with the group. This development comes 400 days into the war and after the October 7 massacre, marking a prolonged period of unsuccessful negotiations. Earlier this week, Israeli officials expressed deep pessimism about the possibility of a hostage deal. Hamas reportedly informed mediators that it would not compromise on any agreement that fell short of a permanent cease-fire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, rejecting incremental proposals for smaller-scale exchanges. 'Truth must be told, there is no sliver of a deal. The question is whether now we must save the surviving hostages and end the war in Gaza,' said officials familiar with the negotiations. 'We must face facts. The big question is whether the time has come to save the remaining hostages and end the war in Gaza. That is the entire discussion behind the scenes: there will be no deal without convergence toward ending the war in Gaza.' Israeli officials also believe there could be 'renewed momentum' for a deal following the U.S. elections. Sources indicated that dialogue with mediators is ongoing, primarily to assess whether Hamas may shift its stance. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has set an offer of millions of dollars for each hostage released, with officials working on broadcasting the proposal across various platforms. The offer aims to incentivize those holding hostages to facilitate their release, with a reward of $5 million per hostage and safe passage to a third country for those who agree.

Jordan's tourism industry struggling as Gaza war deters visitors	Jordan’s tourism sector, crucial to its economy, facing severe losses as Middle East tensions deter Western travelers; Petra’s hotel occupancy drops as low as 10%, with operators reporting 90-95% drop in future bookings and international airlines canceling flights Enas Al Hinti has cut staff pay in half and asked workers to take unpaid leave in an effort to keep her hotel in ancient Petra open as Western holidaymakers fearful of conflict shun destinations in the Middle East. A crisis across the region's tourism industry since the start of the Israel-Hamas war 13 months ago is being felt acutely in Jordan, whose border with Israel along the Red Sea and Dead Sea is studded with beach resorts. Sites such as Petra, Wadi Rum and crusader castles have been drawing visitors for decades - more than one million a year before the war, mainly Americans and Europeans. But Reuters reporters on a recent trip to the city carved from rose-colored rock - Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction - found businesses boarded up by their owners. 'There are no revenues, it's all losses,' Al Hinti, who runs the Nomads hotel, told Reuters. Data and interviews with seven hotel and business owners and tour operators underline the damage to the tourist industry, which made up 12.5% of the economy last year. Flight ticket bookings to Jordan, which is not involved in the conflict, were down 35% year-on-year between Sept. 16 and Oct. 4, data from travel intelligence firm ForwardKeys shows. The situation has worsened since Iran's drone and missile attack on Israel in April and following tit-for-tat military strikes between Israel and Iran, said Seif Saudi, the managing director of Amman-based Jordan Direct Tours. Long-term damage The tourist industry across the Middle East is struggling. Flight bookings to the region are down 6% year-on-year since the war erupted after Hamas-led terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, ForwardKeys data shows. Bookings to Israel and Lebanon fell even more sharply than those to Jordan between Sept. 16 and Oct. 4, while Oman, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain have seen smaller declines. The recent regional escalation of the conflict, including intensified Israeli attacks on Lebanon's Hezbollah terrorist group, has dashed hopes for a recovery in the cooler autumn months, a key season for Middle East tourism. International tour groups like Intrepid and Riviera Travel said they canceled tours to Jordan and Egypt after Iran showered Israel with ballistic missiles on Oct. 1. Hotel occupancy rates in Petra have fallen on average to as low as 10%, estimates Abdullah Hasanat, president of the Petra Hotels Association. 'We are searching for a savior. All the investments in Petra are in intensive care. When tourism stopped, bookings stopped,' Hasanat, who owns a hotel himself, told Reuters. Most international carriers have halted flights to Beirut and Tel Aviv, but some, such as Ryanair have also paused flights to Jordan, in part due to its proximity to Israeli and Lebanese airspace. Hotel owners said Ryanair's decision in particular meant far fewer Western tourists came to the country. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told Reuters in October it was a 'sensible' move given the closure of airspace at the time. Before the war, Christian tourists making pilgrimages to Israel often also tagged on a trip to Jordan. What's next Business owners say the damage will be long-term. Future bookings have evaporated, forcing hotel managers like Al Hinti to dip into their financial reserves to continue paying salaries. She is keeping her hotel open, but with fewer floors available. 'We are facing next year with a drop of not less than 90-95% (in bookings),' said Nabih Riyal, CEO of Plaza Tours, which runs vacations with European and American operators. Jordan's tourism sector has survived previous crises related to the prolonged conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, Tourism Minister Lina Annab told Reuters. 'This calls for us to really focus on our most resilient markets, which are not as affected by the situation,' Annab said, adding that visitors are still coming from neighboring countries. Some Western tourists are undeterred too. 'We knew that the trip would be canceled if it was really risky,' said Dorothy Lawson, a tourist from California, walking around Petra in late October. 'They said we could come. So we came and we're really glad we did.' But businesses that rely on big crowds are struggling to survive. 'We used to have 4,000 visitors every day,' said Marcus Massoud, a salesman in one of Petra's many souvenir shops. 'Now we have 300 to 400. It's not like before.'

Hezbollah fire targets major cities in Israel's north	Acre, Haifa, Safed, Tiberias all come under rocket attacks during Saturday; Hezbollah claims it shot down an IDF drone over South Lebanon using a surface-to-air missile Hezbollah continued to target Israel's north on Saturday firing dozens of rockets at vast areas of the Galilee and the Haifa Bay area including Acre and Haifa and Tiberias, on the shores of the Sea of Galilee The IDF said most projectiles were intercepted or fell in open areas. At the same time Lebanese media reported Israeli strikes on the South Lebanon city of Nabatiyeh and other town and villages in the region. According to the Iran-backed terror group at least seven people were killed in Israeli strikes on Friday. Hezbollah claimed its forces shot down an Israeli Hermes 450 drone with a surface-to-air missile. The IDF said its planes attacked Beirut's Dahieh quarter overnight and its forces on the ground found and destroyed Hezbollah launch pads and infrastructure near the village of Shabaa on the foothills of Mt. Hermon. The military said the launch pad was used to target Israel including a missile attack on the Druze village of Majdal Shams earlier this year where 12 children were murdered. The Hezbollah-affiliated Al Akhbar newspaper quoted sources claiming Israel warned UNIFIL peacekeepers to avoid travel south of the Litani River, amid Israeli strikes. According to the report, Israel asked UNIFIL to coordinate its troop movements with the IDF and linked those requests to plans to expand the Israeli offensive.
