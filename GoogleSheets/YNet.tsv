Elon Musk finds new adversary in Lockheed Martin after F-35 repor...	Tech entrepreneur shares video of drones flying and captions ridiculing comment on American defense company, leading to its stock crashing Tesla CEO Elon Musk sparked controversy over the weekend by criticizing Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jet program, a key defense initiative. Musk’s remarks, delivered via X (formerly Twitter), caused Lockheed shares to drop 3.8% on Monday, closing at $521.89 and wiping out nearly $5 billion in market value. Musk shared a video on Sunday showing drones flying in coordinated formations, captioned, 'Meanwhile, some idiots are still building manned fighter jets like the F-35.' His comments drew attention not only because of his influence as the head of Tesla and SpaceX but also due to his advisory role with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s administration. A scathing report Musk’s comments come after the U.S. Pentagon has identified significant challenges with the F-35 stealth strike fighter jets, critical to Israel’s Air Force operations, according to a classified 382-page report. The F-35, known as 'Adir' in Israel, faces issues with stealth reliability, maintenance systems and operational efficiency, raising questions about the world’s most expensive weapons system, which has cost $1.8 trillion to develop. The report revealed recurring malfunctions in the jet's prognostic health management system, designed to detect issues automatically. High false alarm rates—averaging one per hour instead of the standard one per 50 hours—have complicated maintenance and delayed missions. The report also noted problems with the F-35’s lethality due to design flaws in its gun systems and challenges maintaining its low-observability signature, a cornerstone of its stealth capabilities. Operational availability is another concern, with repair times twice as long as required, limiting the aircraft's mission readiness. Despite its advanced design to counter threats from adversaries like China and Russia, the F-35 has undergone only one relevant test to evaluate this capability. Cyber vulnerabilities also emerged as a critical issue, with the Pentagon urging Lockheed Martin to enhance defenses against digital threats. The company responded, citing significant investments in cybersecurity. Lockheed Martin defended the jet, stating that over 90% of its systems meet required standards and attributing many issues to logistical failures rather than design flaws. However, the report’s findings reignite debates over the F-35’s cost-effectiveness and suitability for long-range missions. The F-35 and its role in defense The F-35, a cutting-edge fighter jet capable of stealth combat, supersonic flight, and advanced weaponry delivery, is central to the U.S. Defense Department’s arsenal. Comparable aircraft exist in Russia and China, highlighting the strategic importance of the program. Despite Musk’s criticism, experts argue the F-35 fulfills critical roles that drones cannot. 'Modern fighter jets fill irreplaceable roles,' said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory. He explained that drones lack the ability to intercept enemy bombers or undertake missions thousands of miles from their launch points, such as supporting naval operations. Drones are increasingly integral to military strategies, particularly as technology evolves. The Defense Department’s 'Replicator Initiative' aims to deploy thousands of autonomous systems for diverse military missions. However, analysts emphasize that the future of military operations involves both drones and manned aircraft, each serving distinct purposes. Military perspectives on drones Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific forces, addressed the growing use of drones during a recent talk at the Brookings Institution. When asked about the potential application of Ukraine’s drone successes against Russia in a hypothetical Taiwan-China conflict, Paparo dismissed the notion that drones alone could counter China’s extensive military capabilities. 'The [Chinese military] has 2,100 fighters, three aircraft carriers and a battle force of 200 destroyers,' Paparo said, adding sarcastically, 'Oh well, Roger, we’ve got a couple drones. No problem.' Lockheed’s response Lockheed Martin issued a statement, stressing the F-35’s importance. 'The F-35 is the most advanced, survivable, and connected fighter aircraft in the world, a vital deterrent and the cornerstone of joint all-domain operations,' the company said. Lockheed also expressed its commitment to working with President-elect Trump and Congress to strengthen national defense. Musk did not respond to a request for comment. Financial implications The F-35 program represents a significant portion of Lockheed’s business, accounting for about 25% of its sales, according to Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu. The program also impacts the broader defense supply chain, contributing 10% of sales at Northrop Grumman, 5% at L3Harris Technologies, and 1% at Honeywell International. Lockheed is expected to deliver 150 F-35 jets in 2024 and 156 in 2025, with each jet priced at roughly $80 million. The company also generates service and development revenue tied to the program. Despite Musk’s critique, his own ventures intersect with the defense sector. As CEO of SpaceX, valued at $250 billion, Musk oversees a company that has challenged traditional government contractors like Lockheed. SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell recently criticized cost-plus government contracts, advocating for cost-efficiency and performance-based profits.

While the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% and 1%, respectively, Lockheed’s stock fell. Defense budgets and geopolitical threats typically drive Lockheed’s performance, but Musk’s public comments have added a new variable for investors to consider. Since the Nov. 5 presidential election, Lockheed shares have dropped 0.2%, while the S&P 500 has gained 4.5%. However, year-to-date, Lockheed’s stock remains up about 20%. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hytcw1qqyg	2024-11-25T22:11:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/25/rJyjydfXJl/rJyjydfXJl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Fact vs. fiction: The truth about Israel’s humanitarian aid to Ga...	Comment: When in the history of warfare has a country provided humanitarian aid and medical services to its enemy? Israel has been accused by the United Nations and other international so-called human rights organizations of purposefully withholding humanitarian aid and starving the Gazan population. And the International Criminal Court has even gone so far as to issue arrest warrants against Israel's Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant—saying they have committed, among other things, the war crime of using starvation as a method of warfare. This is, of course, false. Anyone who has been truly following the war this past year knows this is a ridiculous accusation. Just how ridiculous? Well, let’s take a look at the numbers: Since the start of the war, Israel, through COGAT, which is the Israeli government body responsible for coordinating and facilitating humanitarian aid for Gaza, has facilitated the entry of over 2.2 billion pounds of humanitarian aid. That is over 1 million tons of aid to Gaza on 57,545 massive trucks. And food—Israel has facilitated over 872,000 tons of food on over 40,000 trucks into Gaza and over 50,000 tons of water. It also supplies water through water lines and water pumping facilities. It has also brought in over 27,000 tons of medical aid on over 2,700 trucks and has vaccinated Gaza's civilian population against disease. Does that sound like genocide? Does that sound like purposeful starvation? When in the history of warfare has a country provided humanitarian aid and medical services to its enemy? But the UN alone has cried out famine and genocide countless times. As have the useful idiots on the streets of Western cities. They, of course, completely ignore the fact that Israel sends in the trucks, the food, the aid, only to have Hamas hijack them once they make their way into Gaza. Recently, 98 aid trucks were hijacked and the goods stolen. By who? The UN refuses to say. UNRWA and the UN have proven to be incompetent and unable to even properly deliver aid to Gazan civilians—their main job. So they place the blame on Israel. It’s an easy out. But the numbers speak for themselves. The accusations against Israel—ludicrous. And I’ll add—how much aid are the hostages receiving? There are still 101 hostages being held in Gaza. How much food is being delivered to them? How much medical care are they receiving? Which international organization is looking out for them? Sadly, we all know the answer. Shameful.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjoftkxxjl	2024-11-25T21:30:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/01/09/yk13733454/yk13733454_0_0_579_326_0_small.jpg
Israel raises travel threat level for Thailand	Thailand joins a growing list of countries where the threat level for Israelis has been increased Israel's National Security Council has elevated the threat level for Israelis traveling to Thailand to Level 2, citing the persistence of potential dangers. While the council emphasized that the threat itself has not worsened, it issued the raised warning to ensure Israelis remain cautious. The advisory recommends that Israelis in Thailand avoid attending large events associated with Israel and conceal Jewish or Israeli symbols. Travelers are also urged not to share their location or travel plans on social media. This updated warning follows a previous advisory on November 12, which called on Israelis to heighten their awareness while abroad. Concerns have grown since earlier this month when the Mossad confirmed that terrorists were planning an attack targeting Israelis at a Full Moon Party on the island of Ko Pha Ngan, a popular destination for Israeli tourists. Thailand joins a growing list of countries, including Australia and several Western European nations, where the threat level for Israelis has been increased due to security concerns.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy00jvyxmjx	2024-11-25T21:21:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/12/r1HIgigz1g/r1HIgigz1g_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Will Israel’s northern residents feel safe to return home?	Sarit Zehavi: 'The IDF gained great achievements' in Lebanon The only way that the 65,000 displaced residents of northern Israel will return to their homes after a ceasefire agreement is if they feel that Hezbollah cannot regain power, according to Sarit Zehavi, founder and CEO of Alma. In an interview with ILTV News, Zehavi said, 'The key question is whether we're going to see Hezbollah military operatives watching us from the kitchen windows, just on the other side of the border.' If Hezbollah is back on the border, she said, 'the future of the North is very unclear and that is an understatement.' Zehavi noted that even if it is safe, it is possible that a percentage of those who can afford to live elsewhere and who do not have an emotional attachment to the North may choose to stay away. 'That's why it's so important to make sure that Hezbollah cannot recover,' she said. However, Zehavi said she was in favor of a ceasefire agreement because the residents of the North 'want to go back to normality.' She said, 'The IDF gained great achievements, military achievements, against Hezbollah, degrading its capabilities on various fields, including killing the leadership of Hezbollah, killing more than 170 commanders of Hezbollah, eliminating big amounts of its rockets and pushing it away from the border.' So what is the concern? Whether Hezbollah will be capable of recovering, Zehavi noted.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by7ihkxqyg	2024-11-25T21:07:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/19/Skln00L6Yfkl/Skln00L6Yfkl_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
Pope Francis clarifies Israel 'genocide' remarks: 'Taken out of c...	Pope Francis, addressing a diverse interfaith delegation, says that his remarks that Israel should be investigated for genocide were taken out of context: 'I did not claim that Israel committed genocide, Hamas should no longer exist in the world' Pope Francis met with an interfaith delegation at the Vatican on Monday, which included Jewish, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, and Druze representatives. He clarified that remarks attributed to him in excerpts from an upcoming book, suggesting he said 'Israel should be investigated for genocide in the Gaza Strip,' were taken out of context. 'I did not claim that Israel committed genocide,' he explained to the delegation. 'I was shown materials from the war, and I said that if this is true, then it needs to be investigated. I understand what is happening in Gaza. I think Hamas should no longer exist in the world, but the war should also not be prolonged,' he emphasized. The meeting included Rabbi Yosef Garmon, formerly the Chief Rabbi of Guatemala and currently head of 'The Humanitarian Coalition,' which promotes humanitarian programs in Latin America. Rabbi Garmon, a tank commander in the 9026 Battalion who participated in fighting in Gaza and the north, addressed the Pope, who was born and raised in Argentina before becoming the leader of the Catholic world: 'You cannot say that Israel must be investigated for genocide. 'Look at my fellow soldiers who died from our unit,' Rabbi Garmon continued. 'They died because we entered Gaza only to search for the terrorists and to protect the innocent. Israel also protects the Palestinians and liberates them from Hamas. Any other country would bomb them from the air and eliminate this threat in one day. Israel has the capability to end the war in one day and erase Gaza entirely, but it did not act that way and risked its soldiers to prevent the killing of innocents. You should investigate those who call to investigate Israel - not the other way around.' Pope Francis reiterated that his words were taken out of context and noted his agreement that people of different faiths are also threatened by radicalism, and if it prevails, everyone loses. He claimed that while Palestinians continuously send him materials about the war, Israel does not provide him with documentation or draw attention to it. Druze religious leaders from Hurfeish, a Druze town in northern Israel, also attended the meeting, informing the Pope that the Druze community in Israel suffers from terrorism and recounting the story of 12 children killed in Majdal Shams in the northern Golan by a Hezbollah rocket. About a week and a half ago, an Israeli delegation of families of hostages and those released from Hamas captivity visited the Vatican and met with the Pope and senior Italian officials. During the meeting, Tal Shem's family gave the Pope a soccer jersey with Tal's name and called for his release. This followed a conversation between Nevo, Shem's son, and Pope Francis about their shared love for football before the delegation's arrival. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Pope expressed his closeness to the families of the hostages and committed to doing everything he can to ensure their release. 'I pray for you and your people,' he noted, 'and the first important thing is to save people.' The delegation also included Yelena Trofanov, whose son Sasha is still in captivity; Yocheved Lifshitz, whose husband Oded is still held in Gaza, and her daughter Sharon Lifshitz who accompanied the delegation; Adi Shem, who, along with her children Nevo and Yahel, was released from Hamas captivity after 50 days, while the family patriarch Tal remains in captivity; and Luis Har, who was released in a heroic operation after 129 days in captivity. At the end of October, the Pope also met with Alon Kaminer, considered one of the war's most severely wounded from its outset. A year after the injury, in which he lost both hands, a leg, and an eye, he traveled to the Vatican with a delegation from the Sheba Medical Center, and the Pope embraced and blessed him. 'In our meeting, he told me to keep smiling and to keep pushing forward,' Kaminer recounted. 'Our conversation was a simple exchange between two people, and at the end, he told me that I have a beautiful smile. It was amazing; it was a really strong and emotional experience.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s111vvugqkl	2024-11-25T19:27:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/25/BJf009SfQke/BJf009SfQke_0_206_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu's dilemma: Appeal ICC warrants or wait for Trump?	PM calls meeting on ICC situation as some allies back appealing warrants, while others push to wait for Trump administration to unleash 'hellish sanctions,' aiming to pressure court into suspending them Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to convene a meeting on Tuesday to discuss the arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague against him and former defense minister Yoav Gallant. The decision will determine whether Israel will appeal these warrants. Israel has until Wednesday to officially notify the ICC if it intends to appeal the decision. Legal experts suggest Israel has grounds for a legal appeal, though this remains uncertain. The appeal can challenge the judges' arguments but not the warrants themselves. In contrast, the political leadership suggests ignoring the warrants and delivering a 'lesson' to the court through severe sanctions, which they believe will be imposed by the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. 'The Americans plan hellish sanctions against any country that assists the court, and that's where it will end,' an Israeli official said. 'We shouldn't have to beg before a body we have no trust in.' However, court officials have provided indications Israel could manage the situation if it establishes an internal inquiry. Given the strong responses from senior members of the incoming Trump administration to the court's decision to issue the warrants, Jerusalem is inclined not to appeal and to wait for developments on the international stage, namely Trump's entry to the White House on January 20. 'My assessment is that the court will eventually back down because the pressure on it will be unprecedented, and they have never experienced anything like it,' an Israeli source familiar with the details remarked last week. 'They will beg us to give them a way out. After they undergo a 'lesson' that brings them down to earth, we might then consider helping them climb down.' While there is no option to appeal the arrest warrants themselves, an appeal can be filed against the court's determinations with the appeals chamber. However, such appeals do not freeze the warrants, fueling skepticism in Israel about the appeals process. The appeals chamber includes diplomats from Mongolia, Peru and Japan—figures perceived as lacking legal expertise and familiarity with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israeli officials fear ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan may pursue secret arrest warrants against IDF soldiers and officers. The issue is now shifting to the political arena, as the court’s decision could directly impact Israeli leaders. The 124 countries party to the Rome Statute, which governs the ICC, would be legally obligated to arrest and extradite Netanyahu or Gallant if they enter their jurisdiction. Gallant is scheduled to travel to Washington next Sunday for high-level talks with U.S. officials at the White House and State Department. This marks his first visit to the U.S. since the ICC issued an arrest warrant against him. The trip follows Netanyahu’s previous ban on Gallant’s U.S. visits before his dismissal earlier this month. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In response to the ICC decision, the White House has expressed strong opposition. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said that the United States 'rejects the decision fundamentally,' criticizing the prosecutor’s haste and the errors in the process. He reiterated that the ICC lacks jurisdiction in the matter and confirmed ongoing coordination with Israel and other partners to determine the next steps. As the U.S. is not an ICC member and has not signed the Rome Statute, Gallant faces no direct legal risk during his visit. However, the situation may complicate his travel route, as some European countries could potentially block the use of their airspace. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1se0ugqkl	2024-11-25T13:11:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/21/ByFJ3s2Gye/ByFJ3s2Gye_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Thousands gather to mourn Chabad rabbi murdered in UAE	Large crowds brave heavy rain to lay Rabbi Zvi Kogan, murdered last week after being abducted in Dubai, to rest in Jerusalem's Mount of Olives Thousands gathered under heavy rain Monday evening to lay Rabbi Zvi Kogan to rest, following his murder in the United Arab Emirates last week after being abducted from Dubai. The funeral procession began at the 770 House in Kfar Chabad, with the burial scheduled for Jerusalem’s Mount of Olives. Rabbi Kogan, 25, came from a large ultra-Orthodox family unaffiliated with Chabad. After completing his yeshiva studies, he followed his brother Reuven—an influential figure in Dubai—and joined the Chabad movement, eventually moving to the UAE. Kogan served as an aide to Rabbi Levi Duchman, the UAE’s chief rabbi, and managed the kosher grocery store Rimon Market in Dubai, where he was last seen on Thursday. He married six months ago, to Rivky Holtzberg, the niece of Chabad emissaries Gavriel and Rivka Holtzberg, who were murdered in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. Jared Kushner, son-in-law of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, announced Monday that he and his wife Ivanka donated $1 million to Chabad UAE in memory of Rabbi Kogan. 'Ivanka and I are saddened by the loss of Rabbi Kogan, who was senselessly murdered to stop the historic bridges he was building between Jews and Muslims in the UAE,' Kushner wrote on X. The couple emphasized that 'In the UAE, people of all faiths and backgrounds thrive together in an environment of mutual understanding and respect,' and criticized the 'constant scapegoating of Israel and the Jewish people,' calling it a distraction by 'inept leaders who use hatred to deflect from their own shortcomings.' Kogan's body was handed over to ZAKA volunteers earlier Monday and flown to Israel for burial. His family, including his grieving wife Rivky, arrived in Israel ahead of the funeral. 'We’re in shock, shattered, horrified,' said Aaron Shpielman, Rivky’s brother. 'We want good things to come. We want the Messiah. My sister is in a state beyond words.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Authorities in the UAE announced that the suspects had fled to a third country, reportedly Turkey, after the murder. In a Gulf-state-led operation, they were captured and extradited to Abu Dhabi.

Reports suggest the suspects had tracked Kogan’s movements before abducting him in Dubai and driving him to Al Ain, 90 minutes away. Evidence of violence and blood was found in his vehicle, which the suspects used before murdering him and discarding his body, discovered Sunday. UAE authorities are expected to seek the death penalty for the suspects. While no motive has been officially stated, Israeli officials have labeled the murder an antisemitic terror attack. However, the UAE’s official announcements have referred to Kogan only by his Moldovan citizenship, avoiding mention of his Israeli nationality. Israeli sources believe the attack was not directed by Iran but possibly by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hamas or another terrorist group.

Withdrawal and freedom of action: What’s in the Lebanon agreement...	With cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah reportedly imminent, deal outlines 60-day trial period, Lebanese Army and UNIFIL deployment, US-led international enforcement committee and provisions allowing Israel to address threats and violations After nearly 14 months of clashes and exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah, cease-fire seems ever closer with Israel reportedly having given its approval to end the hostilities. Lebanese officials and a Western diplomat told Reuters that Washington has informed Beirut a cease-fire could be announced 'within hours,' pending approval by the Security Cabinet, which is scheduled to convene Tuesday. These are the key provisions of the emerging agreement. Israeli withdrawal timeline: Under the proposed agreement, Israeli ground forces would begin withdrawing from southern Lebanon within 60 days of the cease-fire's implementation. The withdrawal, described as a 'pilot phase,' aims to assess the feasibility of the arrangement. Once completed, Israel plans to call on northern residents displaced by the fighting to return home. During this interim period, Hezbollah is expected to retreat north of the Litani River. Border negotiations: The agreement also stipulates that Israel and Lebanon will begin negotiations over disputed border points following the implementation of the cease-fire. However, Israel cannot be compelled to accept specific compromises. Deployment of Lebanese Army and UN peacekeepers: The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) would replace withdrawing Israeli troops south of the Litani. These forces would oversee the dismantling of remaining Hezbollah infrastructure in the area and ensure the terror group does not reestablish its presence. Additionally, LAF, with UNIFIL support, would monitor and prevent weapons smuggling and production within Lebanon, bolstered by Western military aid from the U.S., UK and France. International oversight mechanism: A U.S.-led international enforcement committee would be established to oversee compliance with the agreement, drawing on UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which followed the 2006 Lebanon War. The committee would include Britain, Germany and France, despite Israeli opposition to French involvement. Israel has conditioned its acceptance of France's role on assurances that Paris will not enforce International Criminal Court arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or former defense minister Yoav Gallant. The Lebanese sought involvement from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Jordan in the agreement, but none of these countries have officially declared they will take part in the committee. However, it is likely that at least one Arab state will play some role. The international mechanism is expected to assist the LAF and UNIFIL in enforcing their responsibilities under the agreement. The committee is also tasked with determining whether to allow one side to use force if the other violates the agreement. On this issue, the agreement does not mandate a specific timeline for a response. This means that if Israel identifies a threat from the Lebanese side that breaches the agreement, it will be able to act immediately. Hezbollah prisoners and targeted killings: The agreement stipulates that Hezbollah operatives captured by Israel during ground operations will not be returned to Lebanon. While Hezbollah sought guarantees against targeted killings of its leaders, Israel refused to commit, leaving the issue unresolved. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: U.S. security guarantee for Israel: A separate U.S.-endorsed document not included in the Lebanese agreement preserves Israel's right to take immediate military action against direct threats, such as rocket launches or bombings. Israel would also retain the ability to interdict arms transfers from Syria to Hezbollah. For non-immediate threats, Israel would first refer cases to the enforcement committee. Israeli officials highlighted differences between the emerging deal and UN Security Council Resolution 1701, amid criticism from northern residents and local leaders directed at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Unlike the 2006 resolution, the new agreement establishes an international enforcement committee led by the U.S., which Israel believes will be more robust than previous reliance on UNIFIL alone. The agreement also recognizes Israel's right to prevent Hezbollah’s rearmament and to address emerging threats south of the Litani River, which Israeli officials view as a significant step toward ensuring long-term security.

U.S. prosecutors asked a U.S. judge on Monday to drop the criminal case accusing President-elect Donald Trump of seeking to overturn his 2020 election defeat, citing his impending return to the presidency following his successful 2024 campaign. Prosecutors working with Special Counsel Jack Smith said a longstanding U.S. Justice Department policy holding that sitting presidents should not face criminal prosecution requires the case to be dismissed before Trump takes office on Jan. 20. 'This outcome is not based on the merits or strength of the case against the defendant,' prosecutors wrote in a court filing. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung called the move 'a major victory for the rule of law.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkyt0bz71g	2024-11-25T10:24:02-08:00	
Lebanon spoils: IDF reveals over 60,000 Hezbollah weapons seized ...	Massive arsenal stored at IDF logistics base includes jeeps, rocket launchers and anti-aircraft missiles; only half of terror group’s captured weaponry transported to Israel while the rest destroyed in the field Over the past two months of its ground campaign in southern Lebanon, the IDF has seized approximately 60,000 pieces of weaponry and military equipment from villages repurposed as Hezbollah strongholds, officials said Monday. The seized items, processed by the IDF’s Trophy Unit in the Technology and Logistics Directorate (Atal), include firearms, combat vehicles, motorcycles, rocket launchers, anti-aircraft missiles and operational intelligence materials. According to IDF sources, the haul represents less than half of the stockpiles uncovered in Hezbollah's staging areas near the Israeli border. For every four weapons caches removed by ground forces, approximately six more were destroyed in the field by forces. Among the 10,000 larger items seized are 40mm shells, rockets and anti-tank missiles. Smaller munitions, like rifle or machine-gun rounds, are counted by the crate. The military is still deliberating how to handle the massive cache, which adds to hundreds of thousands of weapons and munitions uncovered during operations in Gaza. IDF officials noted a significant quality gap between the arsenals: Hezbollah’s weaponry is generally newer, standardized and effective, with much of it originating from Iran and Russia, while Hamas' arsenal is comparatively worn and improvised. Despite the quantity of seized arms, the IDF has no plans to equip its forces with AK-47 rifles or RPG missile launchers, citing the risk of operational confusion and adherence to standard-issue weaponry. However, some materials, particularly explosives, are already being used in the field for destroying tunnels and weapons depots. Among the notable finds were Iranian-made .50 caliber sniper rifles, capable of causing devastating injuries, designed as imitations of Austrian sniper rifles. Hezbollah’s vehicle fleet, also displayed Monday, included off-road ATVs for transporting arms and fighters, as well as larger jeeps and pickups retrofitted to carry rocket launchers, anti-aircraft missiles and mobile heavy machine guns. 20 tons of ammunition a day Atal presented staggering data on military logistics and consumption during the war, now in its 13th month. Historically, both the IDF and government planned for wars lasting up to five weeks, but the current fighting has vastly exceeded those expectations. Medical supplies for combat troops have cost NIS 280 million ($73 million) so far, equivalent to four years of supplies under normal conditions. Additionally, the IDF has supplied two million liters of water to troops in Gaza and consumed 157 million liters of diesel fuel and 500 million liters of jet fuel, primarily for aircraft in both northern and southern theaters. Since October 7, 160 factories producing food and textiles have been repurposed exclusively for military use. Transportation costs have surged dramatically, with the cost of airlifting one kilogram of goods for the IDF rising from $3–$4 pre-war to $17 due to aviation challenges. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Atal has supplied 15 million spare parts to combat units. Thousands of armored vehicles and trucks worn down by the prolonged fighting have been repaired, with 90% of vehicles damaged by IEDs or anti-tank missiles restored to operational status within an average of two and a half weeks. Over the past year, the IDF’s armored vehicles, including tanks and APCs, have logged 900,000 kilometers—four times the distance of an average year packed with drills and training. The military has also repaired or replaced 8,150 engines, many in active combat zones in Gaza and Lebanon. For example, the readiness of armored vehicles and bulldozers in the 162nd Division, fighting continuously in Gaza since the war’s start, now stands at 85%. The number of mechanical repairs completed during ground operations in Gaza is equivalent to servicing the equipment of 13 entire divisions. Atal's policy has prioritized direct support to front-line units, often at great cost. The logistics branch has suffered 97 fatalities and 2,200 wounded so far. It has conducted 2,000 logistical missions, replenished units 800 times, delivered 100 tons of supplies by air and sea and provided 1,600 living quarters for troops. Daily, Atal distributes 20 tons of ammunition via 90 trucks, 300,000 liters of diesel, 15,000 liters of jet fuel and 500 equipment items to troops. The IDF has also procured 70,000 new tactical helmets and receives 70 drones daily to support combat operations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1rgxszxye	2024-11-25T09:55:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/25/ByM3WOgfQke/ByM3WOgfQke_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Israel braces for heavy Hezbollah attacks as cease-fire nears	Stricter safety guidelines issued for border communities and Golan Heights; schools in Nahariya and Acre remain closed; leaders slam Netanyahu: 'We refuse to once again fall into the slumber dictated by international interests' Amid reports that a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah could be announced 'within hours,' Israeli authorities in the north are bracing for an anticipated surge in rocket fire. Military officials believe Hezbollah may launch an intensified assault in the final days of the fighting, prompting heightened readiness and revised civil defense measures. The IDF announced stricter guidelines following a security assessment. Frontline communities in the northern Golan Heights, including Katzrin and Kidmat Tzvi, will transition from 'partial activity' to 'limited activity' status. Restrictions include a ban on educational activities, a maximum of 10 people in outdoor gatherings and 100 in indoor spaces, and work permitted only where access to shelters is immediate. In Haifa and the Bay region, education will continue under the 'yellow protocol,' requiring proximity to protected areas during activities. The Security Cabinet is scheduled to meet Tuesday to approve the cease-fire agreement, following reports that Israel had given preliminary approval to move forward. However, northern residents remain on edge, with some referring to the coming days as Hezbollah’s 'farewell barrage.' Frustration is mounting in northern Israel, with residents accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of 'abandoning' them. Local anger has been exacerbated by reports of progress in cease-fire talks, which residents claim they are learning about only through the media. In Western Galilee’s Mateh Asher Regional Council and in Nahariya, authorities preemptively announced that schools would remain closed Tuesday, with all education shifted to online platforms. Kindergartens, extracurricular activities and municipal services, including city hall reception, have been suspended. Social activities in Mateh Asher are permitted only under strict conditions and with the oversight of community emergency teams. The tension is mirrored across the border, where spontaneous celebrations were reported in the Lebanese city of Tyre following news of the cease-fire negotiations. Local leaders outraged Acre Mayor Amihai Ben Shlush announced that no classes will be held Tuesday in the city’s educational institutions, citing heightened security risks ahead of the potential agreement. In a statement to residents, Ben Shlush explained, 'These days leading up to the signing of a cease-fire are particularly dangerous for us. Some may view this decision unfavorably. I understand your frustrations and difficulties, but I cannot accept accusations of abandoning children. That’s simply not true.' He added, 'I act solely based on professional considerations to ensure the safety and well-being of our city’s residents. After discussions with Home Front Command, I was informed that heavy barrages are expected, and we must be prepared. I hope I’m wrong, but I’d rather err on the side of caution than risk lives. I’ve decided to close all educational institutions, including informal education programs, for 24 hours. Classes will continue via Zoom.' Moshe Davidovich, head of the Mateh Asher Regional Council and chairman of the Confrontation Line Forum, responded to the reports, warning that any agreement must include robust security measures for residents of the northern border region before their return home. 'If a cease-fire agreement between Lebanon and Israel is signed without substantial provisions to restore the security of confrontation line residents—including a fortified buffer zone with a strong international force and the removal of Hezbollah beyond the Litani River—it will be a historic mistake,' Davidovich said. He added, 'We cannot afford to face the same failures that left us vulnerable after Lebanon and the Second Lebanon War, when unenforced agreements left us exposed. I remind the Israeli government that northern residents are Israel’s first line of defense, and as such, their security must be guaranteed.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Uri Kellner, head of the Golan Regional Council, urged the Israeli government to 'complete the mission of removing the threat over northern residents, rather than agreeing to a cease-fire under fire.' He also called on ministers to 'continue strengthening the Golan and the north by bolstering settlements and communities.' Amit Sofer, head of the Merom HaGalil Regional Council, expressed strong opposition to the emerging agreement, saying, 'We hear the cabinet is set to discuss the proposed deal, and I expect we won’t repeat the grave mistakes of October 7, where 101 hostages remain in captivity. We cannot agree to an arrangement that allows a return to northern border villages, each of which serves as a Hezbollah terror outpost, ready to rebuild the terror infrastructure we paid for in soldiers' blood to dismantle.' He added, 'We refuse to once again fall into the slumber dictated by international interests that seek to create the illusion of quiet and security at the expense of confrontation line residents and the future victims. We’re speaking about an agreement, but they’re speaking about a hudna—a temporary truce to prepare for the next attack.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skyucez7yx	2024-11-25T09:15:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/08/04/HJgyQOKnFC/HJgyQOKnFC_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Scathing Pentagon report raises concerns over F-35 fighter jets, ...	Israel relies on F-35 for deep strikes and air defense, but concerns growing over operational reliability, technological superiority and high maintenance costs, raising doubts about the fighter jet’s ability to meet strategic and financial expectations The Pentagon has identified significant challenges with the F-35 stealth strike fighter jets, critical to Israel’s Air Force operations, according to a classified 382-page report. The F-35, known as 'Adir' in Israel, faces issues with stealth reliability, maintenance systems and operational efficiency, raising questions about the world’s most expensive weapons system, which has cost $1.8 trillion to develop. The report revealed recurring malfunctions in the jet's prognostic health management system, designed to detect issues automatically. High false alarm rates—averaging one per hour instead of the standard one per 50 hours—have complicated maintenance and delayed missions. The report also noted problems with the F-35’s lethality due to design flaws in its gun systems and challenges maintaining its low-observability signature, a cornerstone of its stealth capabilities. Operational availability is another concern, with repair times twice as long as required, limiting the aircraft's mission readiness. Despite its advanced design to counter threats from adversaries like China and Russia, the F-35 has undergone only one relevant test to evaluate this capability. Cyber vulnerabilities also emerged as a critical issue, with the Pentagon urging Lockheed Martin to enhance defenses against digital threats. The company responded, citing significant investments in cybersecurity. Lockheed Martin defended the jet, stating that over 90% of its systems meet required standards and attributing many issues to logistical failures rather than design flaws. However, the report’s findings reignite debates over the F-35’s cost-effectiveness and suitability for long-range missions. Israel has purchased 75 F-35 jets tailored to its unique requirements, incorporating advanced local technologies for electronic warfare and data security. Since their 2016 deployment, 39 operational Israeli F-35s have participated in missions, including covert strikes in Syria and drone interceptions. Each jet costs $120 million, with future deliveries funded by U.S. military aid. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Since its deployment in the Israeli Air Force in 2016, the F-35 has played a pivotal role in numerous missions, including precision strikes in Syria and its landmark downing of two Iranian drones in 2021, marking its first aerial victories. Globally, the U.S. has sold over 1,000 F-35 jets, but Israel was the first to deploy the aircraft in combat, striking Iranian targets in Syria in April and May 2018. The Adir has also been central in operations against Hamas in Gaza, Houthi rebels in Yemen, and in July, it reportedly participated in an attack on Iranian targets. Foreign sources allege it was used in a strike on Damascus that killed a senior IRGC commander at the Iranian consulate. Despite its operational success, criticism of the F-35's high maintenance costs and reliability has sparked debate in the U.S. about whether the aircraft is fit for sustained long-range missions. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj00h33z7ye	2024-11-25T08:39:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/09/19/rJLSt1DJT/rJLSt1DJT_0_91_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Christians for Israel building in Netherlands vandalized by pro-P...	Pro-Palestinian protesters descend on C4I headquarters in Nijkerk, spray-painting graffiti, blocking entrances and attempting to assault staff; police intervene and restore order after hours of unrest The headquarters of the Christian pro-Israel organization Christians for Israel (C4I) was attacked Monday morning by dozens of protesters, reportedly from Extinction Rebellion, Justice Now and the Christian Collective. The incident occurred as employees were arriving for work, taking staff by surprise. Protesters spray-painted accusations such as 'supporting genocide,' 'child murderers,' and 'complicit in the events in Gaza' on the building’s facade and blocked the entrance for several hours. Witnesses said some protesters attempted to assault staff members. Police arrived about 20 minutes after the disturbance began, requiring nearly three hours to fully disperse the demonstrators. No injuries were reported. The attack follows earlier acts of vandalism at the building last summer and comes days before Christians for Israel is scheduled to hold a pro-Jewish community rally in Amsterdam. The upcoming demonstration, organized in collaboration with Dutch-Jewish groups, has drawn the ire of organizations critical of Israeli policies. Christians for Israel condemned the attack, emphasizing their long-standing work to foster Jewish-Arab cooperation and provide aid to Palestinian communities. 'For many years, we have contributed hundreds of thousands of Euros to organizations that aid Palestinians and foster cooperation between Arab and Jewish communities in Israel. Accusing us of complicity in genocide ignores these facts,' a representative for Christians for Israel said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Van Oordt expressed disappointment that dialogue attempts with the protesters had failed. 'We’ve said to them, ‘If you want to have a conversation, this is not the way to do it.’ Instead of engaging with facts and constructive dialogue, they resort to yelling, vandalizing, and spreading misinformation,' the representative added. Frank van Oordt, executive director of Christians for Israel Netherlands, said they were 'shocked,' particularly given its execution by self-identified Christians. 'We are standing up for Israel, and it makes us even stronger,' van Oordt said.'We are shocked, especially because it has been done by other Christians. And we can't understand that Christians won't see that it's the biblical truth that God is bringing back his people to the country. But we will stand up and make that known to all Christians in the Netherlands and in the whole world.' The protest marks escalating tensions in the Netherlands following recent attacks on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam and reflects growing hostility in Europe over the war in Gaza. Christians for Israel plans to proceed with the Amsterdam rally on November 28, emphasizing its commitment to combating antisemitism and promoting dialogue. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skrrx7fmyx	2024-11-25T08:16:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/25/HkbYiwWG71g/HkbYiwWG71g_236_210_956_538_0_small.jpg
What’s really fueling Jewish hate?	Yehuda Kurtzer: The root cause of antisemitism isn’t what you think The Jews are not the cause of antisemitism, according to Yehuda Kurtzer, president of the Shalom Hartman Institute. 'I think there are a lot of forces underway across the West that are leading to the return of antisemitism in this pronounced way,' Kurtzer told ILTV News this week. 'This includes climate pessimism, economic pessimism, distrust in government, the decline of institutions, polarization of all of our democratic societies, and the way social media amplifies conspiracy theories and loneliness.' Kurtzer made these comments just days after an anti-NATO protest in Montreal turned violent, targeting Israel and the Jews, which led to several arrests. Additionally, a string of antisemitic incidents on college campuses last week has sparked fresh concerns within the Jewish community. Many worry that 2025 may see as much antisemitism and unrest as the previous year. In the three months following the October 7, 2023 Hamas massacre, the Anti-Defamation League reported a more than 360% increase in antisemitic incidents in the United States alone. Similarly, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights revealed earlier this year that some organizations experienced up to a 400% rise in antisemitism since the start of the war. Even before the conflict, an FRA survey found that 80% of European Jews believed antisemitism had grown in their countries over the prior five years. 'When we look at cases of antisemitism, the more pressing thing to do is to examine the conditions in a society that allow something like this to rise,' Kurtzer said. 'Because antisemitism is a symptom of a societal problem, rather than a problem in and of itself.' He explained that addressing antisemitism requires tackling broader societal issues. 'I want to resist the suggestion that if you fix one thing, you'll solve the [antisemitism] problem,' Kurtzer said. He pointed out that while Jewish leaders often believe Holocaust education or security measures like hiring guards for Jewish institutions will solve antisemitism, these steps alone are not enough. 'What we really need to do is start investigating what's going wrong in our liberal democracies and start addressing that set of problems,' he said. Kurtzer emphasized that unlike during the Nazi era, when governments persecuted Jews, today, Jews are equal citizens of Western societies. This position allows them to push public officials to address societal challenges and partner with the Jewish community. 'In turn, I want our Jewish community to be investing more resources in the infrastructure of liberal democracy rather than simply screaming about this hatred that's happening to us,' Kurtzer said. 'I fear that it actually moves us back into enclave thinking, as opposed to saying, how do we help build trust in institutions? How do we play a role in improving the culture around the media?' He continued, 'Those types of things are very different from what oftentimes passes for the Jewish communal discourse around antisemitism.' Some analysts suggest that history is cyclical and that Jewish communities rarely thrive in any diaspora for over a century. Kurtzer, however, said he disagrees and expressed optimism about the future of American Jews. 'American Jews are experiencing right now the greatest continuity on the planet of any single Jewish community,' he told ILTV. 'It's hard to think about, but we've been going strong in America for a long time, and I would hate to start becoming pessimistic about the future of our community because, you know, it never lasts that long.' Instead, Kurtzer urged Jews to focus on their contributions to American society. 'Now we have a responsibility to invest in this story, our own thriving, and America itself,' he told ILTV. Reflecting on the relationship between American Jews and Israel, Kurtzer, a fourth-generation American and liberal Zionist, said he once worried about the growing distance between the two communities. 'I think that those are completely compatible ideas,' Kurtzer said, noting that on October 7, both Israel and American Jews experienced a shared 'sense of collapse,' highlighting their deep, if sometimes unspoken, connection. 'It kind of indicated to us that these are actually communities that are leaning heavily on each other, even if we don't talk about it all the time,' Kurtzer said. 'I kind of feel like it's in the long-term interest of the Jewish people to build a strong, vibrant democratic Israel and a strong, vibrant democratic American Jewish community. Those simultaneous big bets that defy history are going to actually reinforce each other.'

From total victory to total surrender!': Northern Israelis outra...	Residents and local leaders fear emerging truce will allow terror group to regroup and rebuild; 'What will our residents return to? A devastated city with no security and no future?' asks Kiryat Shmona mayor Reports of progress toward a cease-fire with Hezbollah have sparked significant frustration among residents of northern Israel, who fear that a potential agreement could allow the Lebanese terrorist group to rebuild and once again threaten their safety. An American official said Monday that 'a cease-fire in Lebanon is imminent.' After more than a year of hostilities, residents are calling for a decisive resolution that exploits Hezbollah’s current weakened state following the extensive Israeli bombing campaign, which has targeted much of its leadership. Kiryat Shmona Mayor Avihay Stern expressed strong opposition to the reported deal, urging Israel's leaders to reconsider. 'Before signing what feels like a surrender agreement, I call on our leaders to look into the eyes of Kiryat Shmona’s children and think of their future,' Stern said. 'This agreement brings the threat of October 7 closer to the north. How have we gone from total victory to total surrender? Why not finish what we started? We’ve crushed Hezbollah, yet instead of dismantling it completely, we’re giving it the chance to recover. And what will our residents return to? A devastated city with no security and no future? This is madness,' Stern warned. Residents across the region are demanding that Israel 'end the story' and eliminate Hezbollah’s capabilities, ensuring long-term security before returning to their homes. 'They are playing with our lives' Moshe Davidovich, head of the Mateh Asher Regional Council in the Western Galilee, harshly criticized the emerging cease-fire agreement. 'I ask myself whether I’m living in a dream or a delusion—or if the decision-makers in Israel’s government are the ones delusional,' Davidovich said in an interview with Ynet. 'I’m not the one under delusion, because to present this charade—after people have spent more than a year confined to bomb shelters, after children have wet their beds for over a year, after mental health here has been stretched to the absolute limit—is simply insulting,' he added. 'Anyone who thinks we’re just guinea pigs in a lab has clearly lost their way. And anyone who believes they can just flip a switch, say ‘that’s it, time’s up,’ and that life will return to normal with peace and harmony restored along the confrontation line is living in a fantasy. These are people sitting comfortably in central Israel, in ivory towers, steering us toward disaster. 'We have brave residents here who, for over a year, have lost their livelihoods, their businesses, their agriculture, their tourism and their homes. And yet they [the decision-makers] are playing with our lives. Woe to the nation led by such captains.' Davidovich warned that the consequences of the agreement would fall squarely on the shoulders of government leaders. He condemned their failure to reinforce northern shelters or provide sufficient missile-proof rooms, saying, 'The blood will be on their hands. These are rash, unprofessional, unsafe and insecure decisions. We in the north are the state’s bulletproof vest, its shield, and we pay the price. Tragically, we will continue to pay the price because we are ignored, we are invisible, we do not matter.' Asked about discussions with military officials, Davidovich revealed alarming developments in southern Lebanon in recent days. 'What they’ve discovered just four or five kilometers away is extremely concerning. It’s not something from a year ago, or six months ago, or even a month ago—it’s recent, and it keeps me awake at night.' He specifically referenced threats near Rosh Hanikra: 'Those bunkers uncovered three kilometers from Rosh Hanikra have left me sleepless since Saturday. I’m exhausted, I’m worried, and I fear for the future of Mateh Asher’s children and all the kids along the confrontation line. To force them to return home without proper protection is unconscionable.' 'The house is collapsing on me' The head of the Mateh Asher Regional Council cautioned that residents would not feel secure under the proposed agreement, leading to an increasing number of families leaving the region. 'As the days pass, more and more families are leaving the Galilee and the north,' he said. 'We will do everything in our power to stop this trickle from turning into a flood. But it’s already happening daily, and as long as people don’t feel safe, more families will leave. The responsibility for this will lie squarely on the shoulders of the decision-makers.' David Shmuel, a resident of Nahariya whose home was struck by Hezbollah rockets Sunday, also shared his fears in an interview with Ynet, which was interrupted by another air raid siren. 'Yesterday was a terrible day,' he recounted, describing how his daughter narrowly escaped harm by following safety protocols and rushing to a protected room. 'She made it to the shelter, and two seconds later, a missile hit the building,' Shmuel said. 'I was on the phone with her—she screamed, ‘The house is collapsing on me! I hear screams, glass shattering.’ She was in complete shock. She’s still not calm, but we’re okay, we’re healthy.' Reflecting on over a year of life under fire from Lebanon, Shmuel described the situation as unbearable. 'It’s tough. There’s no life, we’ve had no life for a year now. You can’t plan anything, can’t go anywhere, can’t go out freely, not even to do something simple like exercise outside.' While residents long for peace, Shmuel voiced his opposition to the proposed agreement. 'I don’t think now is the time,' he said. 'I think until Lebanon is cleared of threats, the fire must not stop because it will return. Maybe in a year, two, or three—it will come back. 'In the north, we’re used to this, but I think now is the time to end it for the long term, for decades. We must not reach a one-sided agreement today that serves no one, least of all us in the north.' Politicians across spectrum blast emerging Lebanon agreement Criticism of the proposed agreement has come from politicians across Israel's political spectrum, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. While refraining from issuing ultimatums or threatening to dissolve the government, Ben-Gvir called the agreement a 'historic missed opportunity to eliminate Hezbollah.' 'I understand the constraints and the arguments, but this is a serious mistake,' Ben-Gvir said. 'We need to listen to field commanders and local leaders. Now, when Hezbollah is reeling and desperate for a cease-fire, we must not stop. As I warned in Gaza, I am warning again: Mr. Prime Minister, it’s not too late to stop this agreement! We must push forward until total victory.' Likud MK Amit Halevi also expressed reservations, specifically targeting U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, who reportedly set a deadline for both sides to finalize the agreement or face his withdrawal from negotiations. Israeli officials fear such a withdrawal could lead to a problematic Security Council resolution imposing a cease-fire. Referring to Hochstein’s role in brokering the 2022 maritime border agreement with Lebanon—widely criticized by the current coalition while in opposition—Halevi warned that any 'Hochstein-style agreement' would be disastrous. 'The emerging deal relies on UN Security Council Resolution 1701 from 2006, but it should be based on Resolution 1559 from 2004, which calls for Lebanon’s independence and the disarmament of militias, including Hezbollah,' Halevi said. 'Any agreement that does not include Hezbollah's removal from Lebanon fails to meet Israel's security needs and contradicts the Cabinet’s decision to ensure residents can return home safely.' Likud MK Dan Illouz echoed concerns, calling reports of the near-deal with Hezbollah 'deeply troubling.' 'Instead of exploiting Hezbollah’s weakness after two months of heavy blows, the agreement under discussion grants the organization strategic gains and endangers Israel’s security,' Illouz said. He criticized the proposed deployment of the Lebanese Army in southern Lebanon, calling it 'self-delusion.' 'This is the same army overseen by a government in which Hezbollah holds significant power. It’s the same army that stood idly by as Hezbollah amassed a massive arsenal of rockets threatening Israel’s citizens,' Illouz said. The international oversight mechanism included in the deal also drew skepticism. 'It reminds me of past agreements—impressive on paper but toothless in reality. They did not last even a few months,' he concluded. Opposition leaders have also voiced strong objections to the emerging agreement, emphasizing the need for Israeli military autonomy in protecting the country’s northern residents and rejecting reliance on international forces. National Unity Party leader Benny Gantz said that the defense of northern Israel must remain exclusively under the IDF, dismissing the involvement of international forces. 'We cannot return to the reality of October 6,' Gantz said during a conference on Israel's post-war economic recovery. 'The IDF must retain full operational freedom to counter threats from Lebanon and continue offensive actions against Hezbollah's infrastructure until a desirable agreement is reached.' Speaking later at his party's Knesset faction meeting, Gantz reiterated, 'Without delving into the specifics of the proposed agreement, one thing must be unequivocally clear: with or without a deal, only the IDF will protect the residents of the north. Not UNIFIL, and not the Lebanese Army.' Opposition leader Yair Lapid also expressed reservations while emphasizing the importance of a political resolution. 'I sympathize with the residents of Nahariya and Metula, but ultimately, a political agreement is necessary,' Lapid said. 'The IDF has achieved tremendous successes in Lebanon—from unacknowledged operations to the elimination of Nasrallah and senior officials, and the ongoing strikes in Dahieh and southern Lebanon. These operational achievements are remarkable, but they are meaningless without a political endgame.' Yisrael Beitenu leader Avigdor Liberman was more direct, labeling the deal 'unreasonable' for not requiring the Lebanese government to disarm Hezbollah. 'Israel's leadership remains trapped in the same flawed mindset, still living as if it’s October 6, and nothing has changed,' Liberman said during a faction meeting. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'This agreement is disastrous for Israel,' he added. 'The Iranians have already begun rebuilding Hezbollah, smuggling weapons again. Without mechanisms to create distance and ensure a security buffer, I tell the residents of the north: there’s no reason to return home. We cannot accept a deal that absolves the Lebanese government while allowing Hezbollah to operate freely and prepare for the next war.' Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar stressed the importance of enforceability in any agreement. 'The true test of any deal will not be in its wording or phrasing, but in enforcement,' Sa’ar said. 'This enforcement must focus on two points: preventing Hezbollah from moving south of the Litani River and stopping them from rebuilding their arsenal anywhere in Lebanon.' Sa’ar underscored the government’s commitment to preventing a return to pre-October 7 conditions. 'Any violation must be dealt with immediately. We will not sell the future for temporary peace in the present,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skrliwz7ye	2024-11-25T06:29:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/20/H1u242sfJl/H1u242sfJl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Shiites ask why Hezbollah refused a cease-fire: 'You could have p...	Critics of the terror group say an agreement could have been reached months ago under the same conditions after 1 million people were displaced and thousands killed; Shiite cleric calls on community to reject sectarianism and unite as Lebanese The war in Lebanon is exacting a heavy price from civilians, and on no group more than the Shiite Muslims in Lebanon. While cease-fire negotiations continue and their conclusion is reported to be in sight, some Lebanese Shiites accuse Israel of targeting the entire sect and destroying is historic landmarks. They believe they are being unfairly punished because they share a religious identity with the Hezbollah terror group and often live side by side with them in the same area. Hezbollah continued its rocket fire on Israel on Monday after launching missiles at central Israel a day earlier. Millions were sent into shelters as more than 250 projectiles were launched, causing injuries and damage. The IDF also continued its strikes, including on Hezbollah's Beirut stronghold the Dahieh neighborhood. According to Al Akhbar, Hezbollah's media mouthpiece, there are doubts in Lebanon that an agreement is within reach. 'Israeli and American leaks about a pending deal; Lebanon rejects speculations and awaits the official response.' Thus far at least 3,500 people were killed in Lebanon in the war. Most are Hezbollah operatives but according to reports, 900 of the dead are civilian women and children. One million people have been displaced from their homes and the devastation is estimated at a cost of at least $8 billion. This has prompted some to wonder why Hezbollah had not agreed to a cease-fire months earlier, when the same terms currently discussed, could have been agreed upon. This would have spared Lebanon 'destruction, martyrs and losses worth billions (of dollars),' Lebanese legislator Waddah Sadek, who is Sunni Muslim, wrote on the X platform. Criticism of Hezbollah was also voiced by Bahaa Al Hariri, the son of Lebanon's former prime minister Rafik al Hariri, who was assassinated in a car bomb attack by Hezbollah terrorists in 2005. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Lebanon's independence Day falls at a historic and critical moment this year, in which the country stands at a crossroads that would determine its future,' he said in a post on X. 'The greatest challenge is our internal divisions and the attempts of some to replace the state and its institutions, especially its military.' Hariri continued that real independence means getting rid of foreign guardians, of all forms, and their militias. 'The Lebanese people, of all sectors must join the rebuilding of Lebanon.' In an earlier post he praised the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander, Salim Ayyash, who was involved in his father's assassination, in a strike attributed to Israel and also called on the terror group to lay down its arms, after the assassination of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in September. Shiite cleric Ali Al Amin, who has been critical of Hezbollah in the past, slammed the group for deciding on its own to begin a war with Israel, and called on other Lebanese Shiite leaders to declare that Lebanon is an independent authority and to abandon anything that contradicts its sovereignty or prevents it from fulfilling its role. 'Ask your leaders why they brought this destruction on Lebanon,' he said according to a report in Saudi Arabia's Al Arabiya network. 'Opening a front in support of Hamas in Gaza, only hurt Lebanon,' he said adding that it is time to move forward toward co-existence of all sectors. Some Shiites told the Associated Press that they were concerned that all Shiites in Lebanon will suffer if Hezbollah is weakened, while others said they hoped there could be 'greater political openness,' that would allow a diversity of Shiite voices. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkspnkgxyg	2024-11-25T04:56:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/25/H1IGucW71g/H1IGucW71g_0_0_3000_1974_0_small.jpg

These are the telltale signs of quiet violence against women in r...	On the UN's International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, Israeli women tell of their lives suffering from quiet violence which is harder to prove and more devastating to the soul Rotem was in a violent relationship for over a decade. 'The physical violence began when I was pregnant with my youngest son, but today I can say it was there from the first time we met,' she says. 'Isolation, control, jealousy. He had a need to approve everything I did. Economic, verbal and general violence, throwing things, it was all there, I just didn't know how to identify it.' She says it began with testing the limits of verbal violence. 'The more I let him speak to me badly, the louder our fights, the contempt, the belittling and humiliation around friends, grew. He made me dependent on him. Who would have me? He would ask. What was I worth without him? I found myself trying to change my patterns of behavior and was sure I was the problem,' Rotem says. Like many women who deal with quiet violence, Rotem failed to see the signs or the danger, at first. 'In quiet violence, red lines are constantly crossed. There is a slow development, almost unnoticed. When the story of Shira Isakov who was almost murdered by her husband made headlines, I noticed warning signs that I had been missing.' Rotem says over time she came to realize her life was in danger. 'In every fight he would threaten to slap me and I though to myself it would be better if he would just do it and give me a reason to leave, she says. 'Getting slapped hurts for a bit and then it passes but the quiet violence shakes your entire subconscious,' she says. 'He knew all my sensitive spots. You begin to distrust yourself, have less faith in those around you, become suspicious. Those are things that need years to get over. They leave scars on your soul.' After her second son was born Rotem realized she was not only giving up on herself, but that there were other people who need her. 'I decided to split up but then the threats began. He said he would kill me. This made me walk on eggshells everyday just so that I would not say anything that would set him off.' She was considered at high risk and went with her children to a shelter for battered women. 'It got worse. He would cover my mouth to keep me from screaming, pour water on me and throw food I made into the trash. He would lock me out of the house, hide my car, hide my credit card, throw chairs, plates, glass bottles at me. The house was a broken mess.' Although public awareness of the various forms of domestic violence has increased, many women still fail to recognize the danger that they are in. 'It sounds illogical that a grown person can enter a violent relationship and not understand that they are being treated violently,' Efrat Harel Heiman, a clinical psychologist and head of the Marva Law, Welfare and Empowerment Institute, explains. 'Violence can be physical, sexual, emotional and verbal. Usually such cases involve prolonged violence so I think it would be right to describe it as hidden abuse.' She says these situations can escalate to physical abuse. 'The quiet violence is below the surface. Usually such relationships begin seeming fine and that is a trap that makes the victim believe they are in a good and beneficial partnership. The abuse begins slowly when the victim is already reliant on the abuser. Physical violence could follow and expand in form, over time. The more the abuser feels their victim is submissive, the more they reveal their darker sides.' Liora, a mother of three young children, knows that reality well. 'I was in a toxic relationship for nearly 10 years. I have a career, I am well educated, and I am not a stupid person, despite my partner telling me that I am. I thought he would change, for me. I thought I would be good for him. Today I know I failed. You cannot help someone who does not want to help himself.' She says the violence began early on. 'When we were dating, he would throw things, and once even kicked the wall in. He would punish me. Once he left me on the side of the road and drove off because he didn't like how I behaved. I could have called a friend for help but was embarrassed, so I waited for him to come back,' she says. 'He always made me feel I was at fault and that he only behaved like that with me. I was sure he was the one for me and that it would be wrong to leave him because of my wrongdoings. I told myself I could change, and that I would work hard to be worthy of him. Liora says she could not name what she was going through at first. 'We married quickly when I became pregnant. During our marriage he would spit on me, humiliate and belittle me. We hardly went to social gatherings because I was afraid people would see his outbursts. I lived an unstable life with temper tantrums, and could not make plans because I would never know what mood he would be in.' When the physical abuse began, Liora decided to end the relationship. 'He grabbed on to me and kicked me. That was the turning point. I left home for a while, but he promised he would never do that again and that he would begin treatment. That fizzled out over time. After the second time he was physically violent, I stopped sleeping in the same bed. I was terrified. I went to the police and we split up. But from that point it just got worse,' she says. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'He would break into my house and make threats. He was arrested a couple of times and let go. They thought this was a bad divorce and did not understand that he was a psychopath. In the end his threats became more concrete and I was considered in danger. He was arrested and I was sent to a shelter with my kids.' Liora says quiet violence has no signs and people fail to see they are in that kind of a relationship. 'When I woke up to reality, I asked for a restraining order because I was afraid of him. The judge asked me why I only came now if I was so scared? That to me was the hardest part because when you are beaten physically, it leaves marks, which make it easier for those around you to see and identify the situation. When there are no physical marks, its harder to explain.' Vardit Danziger, CEO of No To Violence Against Women, says quiet violence is dangerous and has severe repercussions. 'It is serious violence. We see more and more women in our shelters who deal with it. It wounds the spirit and can cause trauma, PTSD and anxiety. It is hard to recognize when you are in such a relationship but when you do, it is hard to convince others of it.' 'I think it is time that this matter receives more attention and not only in public discourse. Courts and the police must also recognize it. In France, for example, there is a law that recognizes quiet violence as any other type of violence, but in Israel, the law recognizes physical but not emotional violence, which makes it hard to prove in court,' Danziger says But there is hope. 'Awareness is growing and I think we are on the way to recognition of this type of violence, although we are still far from providing an adequate response to it. I believe we must begin with education. That will bring change.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/skhdzjbmjx	2024-11-25T03:18:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/24/yk14159816/yk14159816_0_83_788_444_0_small.jpg

Iran's Khamenei calls for death sentence for Israeli leaders	Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says arrest warrants are not enough and death sentences must be issued for Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant The supreme leader of Iran, which backs the Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists fighting Israel in Gaza and Lebanon, said on Monday that death sentences should be issued for Israeli leaders, not arrest warrants. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was commenting on a decision by the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants on Thursday for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense chief Yoav Gallant, and a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri. 'They issued an arrest warrant, that's not enough... Death sentences must be issued for these criminal leaders', Khamenei said, referring to the Israeli leaders. In their decision, the ICC judges said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant were criminally responsible for acts including murder, persecution and starvation as a weapon of war as part of a 'widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza.' The decision was met with outrage in Israel, which called it shameful and absurd. Gaza residents expressed hope it would help end the violence and bring those responsible for war crimes to justice.

Handcuffed, blindfolded: See 1st photo of the suspects in the mur...	The suspects in the murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan are all citizens of Uzbekistan; It is believed they did not act on behalf of Iran, but they did act for a terrorist organization The United Arab Emirates late Monday morning released the first photos of the three suspects in the murder of Chabad emissary Rabbi Zvi Kogan, whose body was found in the city of Al-Ain three days after he was kidnapped from Dubai. The UAE Interior Ministry announced that the three suspects are citizens of Uzbekistan. They are named as Olimpi Tohirovic, 28; Mahmoud John Abdul Rahim, 28; and Azizi Kamilovic, 33. No suspected motive for the murder was announced, though Israel has called it an antisemitic terrorist attack. The announcement about the arrest of the three, which was undertaken, according to the United Arab Emirate, 'with record speed,' did not identify Kogan as Israeli, referring to him only as a 'Moldovan citizen,' though he holds dual citizenship. The Iranian Embassy in the Emirates on Sunday night rejected claims about the involvement of the Islamic Republic. Even earlier, Ynet learned that the latest assessment is that the terrorists who murdered Kogan were not acting on behalf of Iran but, apparently, on behalf of Islamic Jihad, Hamas or another terrorist organization. The murder has shaken the UAE's Jewish community, which Jewish groups estimate to number in the several thousand. Kogan was a resident of the UAE and also a Moldovan national, according to local authorities. He lived in the UAE for several years, working as a Chabad emissary. Israeli agencies are taking part in the investigation, an Israeli official told Reuters on Sunday. The Moldovan foreign ministry has said that it is contact with UAE authorities.

Iranian-born Muslim activist attends every pro-Palestinian protes...	Iman Spati, who shows up at every pro-Palestinian demonstration in Berlin despite threats to his life, says 'Ever since I saw them celebrating on October 7, I knew I had to be there' Iman Spati, 38, has no memory of his father, Akbar Spati, except for a small and haunting keepsake: an audio cassette in which his father says, 'Don’t be afraid. Wherever you go, I’ll be watching over you.' A year after recording those words, when Iman was just two years old, Akbar, a political activist in Iran’s opposition, was executed. The man responsible for the sentence was Ebrahim Raisi, then Tehran’s prosecutor general and later Iran’s president. 'To retrieve his body, my mother was forced to pay for the bullets used to kill him,' Spati recalls. In 1999, as repression tightened in Iran and Iman neared military draft age, his family fled to Germany. 'Shortly after I arrived in Germany, I became deeply interested in issues of antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment,' Spati says during an interview at the offices of Bild, where he works as a multimedia producer. 'I remembered how it began the same way in Iran. In 2016, after witnessing Berlin’s Al-Quds Day rally, where horrific slogans were shouted and Iranian, Hamas and Hezbollah flags waved, I decided to get more active and document these hate demonstrations.' Since October 7, Spati has attended around 140 pro-Palestinian demonstrations in Berlin – not as a journalist, but as a citizen armed with a video camera to capture what he describes as Germany’s descent into hatred. 'At first, thousands came out to support the Palestinian cause,' he explains. 'Now it’s only a few hundred, but they’re much angrier, more antisemitic, and increasingly violent. They attack police, throw bottles, and the officers are exhausted because politicians won’t back them up.' At almost every protest, Spati is targeted. Demonstrators shout, 'F--- you, Iman Spati,' hurl insults, follow him, and threaten him. In July, someone struck him on the head with a flagpole, and later another individual headbutted him. That same month, while walking his dog, he was confronted outside his home by a man wielding a knife and a blonde woman he recognized from previous demonstrations. 'When I chased them, the woman screamed that I was trying to assault her,' he says. Spati was briefly detained but released after police apprehended the assailant. 'There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of complaints about what happens at these demonstrations, and not a single conviction,' Spati says. 'People pretending to be pizza delivery workers knock on my door, accusing me of being a Mossad agent. The rhetoric is violent and threatening, and no one is doing anything about it. On the contrary, some police officers with immigrant backgrounds see me as the problem, as someone stirring up trouble against Arabs.' Who attends these demonstrations of hate? 'It’s a bizarre cocktail of far-left radicals and radical Islamists who have nothing in common except their sweeping hatred for Israel and Jews,' Spati explains. 'Ninety percent of them think what happened on October 7 was a good thing. The other 10% are too afraid to speak out. The mass Muslim migration in 2015 allowed the far left to openly express their antisemitism under the guise of helping Muslim victims. October 7 lit the fuse. The far left bears the responsibility for what’s happening at these protests – they hate colonialist Israel and the West.' And what about the Muslim protesters? 'Most are in it for the money,' Spati says. 'They earn sometimes thousands of euros a month by posting protest videos that rack up hundreds of thousands of views. And it’s become ‘cool’ to be antisemitic and anti-Israel – it’s a way to fit in socially.' According to Spati, the level of violence and incitement rises with each protest. He recalls an incident earlier this month when a passerby wearing a yellow badge to symbolize support for the hostages in Gaza was assaulted, and his young daughter was dragged into a march.

'I’m not afraid of them, I’m afraid of what could happen. I know what it means when people try to bring the Middle East, the place they fled, into the heart of Europe. The average German doesn’t understand what that truly entails.' 'I don’t want to die, but I’m ready to sacrifice my life for the way of life that gave me refuge when I fled Iran,' Spati adds. 'I’m certain my father is watching over me, and he would be proud that his son is carrying on the fight he gave his life for.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1qoo211qkg	2024-11-25T00:45:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/25/Byx734F11Qkx/Byx734F11Qkx_0_50_1024_576_0_small.jpg
Haifa to raze building hit by Hebollah rocket	The Haifa municipality has decided that the 12-story building that was hit Sunday by a rocket barrage toward the city will be demolished. According to the municipality, 'the decision to destroy the building after using engineering tools was made due to the fear that the building will collapse and damage the building next to it.' The municipality added that engineering officials determined that it was a dangerous building that could collapse at any moment, and prohibited its residents from entering, not even to take their personal belongings from the apartments. However, Home Front Command personnel will assist as much as possible in removing personal belongings from some of the apartments in the building.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byxjntz7jx	2024-11-25T00:35:22-08:00

His Chabad emissary son was killed by terrorists in Mumbai: 'It s...	In 2008, Rabbi Nachman Holzberg's son and daughter-in-law, who were Chabad emissaries in Mumbai, were murdered by Islamist terrorists; Now the husband of the rabbi's granddaughter was murdered in the UAE. Just like his son Gabi, the rabbi says, 'Zvi was dedicated to his work, constantly trying to help more people' Some 16 years after his son Gabi and his daughter-in-law Rivka were killed in an attack on the Chabad House in Mumbai, last weekend Rabbi Nachman Holzberg received the news of the murder of his granddaughter's husband Zvi Kogan in Dubai. 'We feel as if the whole tragedy is happening all over again. It's simply incomprehensible,' Holzberg told Ynet. 'Just like 16 years ago, it happens the week before the world gathering of Chabad emissaries, both then and now; my son Gabriel was 28 years old and Zvi was also 28 years old. There are a lot of things happening here together and it overwhelms everything.' There are not only parallels between the circumstances of the murder, but the lifestyles of Gabi and Zvi there are also similar in Holzberg's eyes. 'Everything that was said about Gabi, is also true of Zvi. He was dedicated to his work, constantly trying to help more people, everyone who entered the Chabad house would leave with a smile on their lips. Jew or non-Jew, winter or summer, Shabbat or weekday, he knew how to give the maximum to everyone.' Holzberg added: 'He was one of the greats of the generation in love for Israel and the unity of Israel. All the sheikhs in Dubai loved him dearly, and the people of the country also loved him very much. He was always running for everyone, as far as he was concerned he had no privacy, he did not care for himself. When he would come to events in New York, he would return immediately because he felt that the place he needed him.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Holzberg calls on others to learn from his grandson's example. 'I wish we would learn from him and try to follow his path, smiling at everyone, loving everyone. When my son was murdered, no one asked whether he was from the Likud or Labor, whether he was right or left, whether he was secular or religious. When they came to kill Zvi they didn't think about whether he was from the right or the left, secular or religious. This is the point that needs to be conveyed from Zvi's story and Gabi's story - that everyone should take care of everyone. For example, everyone considers the hostages in the tunnels as if they were their own family. We are in a time with many orphans, families with parents who have lost sons. Think about them, take care of them, and everyone will take stock of themselves, how can they take care of someone else. That's how we will receive a great blessing and a complete redemption.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1pjajwmkg	2024-11-24T23:31:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2016/11/21/7398345/7398345_2_0_2376_2498_0_small.jpg

Ofer is spending his 2nd birthday as a hostage in Gaza	Ofer Calderon marks his 54th birthday in captivity in Gaza, a year after the release of his two children who were kidnapped with him; He told his daughter when she was released, 'Fight for me' Ofer Calderon's 54th birthday falls on Monday, but instead of celebrating it at a picnic with his four children, he is spending it in a dark tunnel with limited oxygen in the Gaza Strip. Last year, days before the release of two of his children who were kidnapped with him from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, Erez and Sahar, Ofer marked his 53rd birthday, and knew that his gift was the return home of his two children. 'Ofer is a very warm, very homely type,' says Ofer's cousin, Eyal Calderon. 'He is a very present father, and this is not a cliché. He has four amazing children and he is present in the lives of each and every one of them. Yesterday, his daughter Gaya said in Hostage Square ahead of Ofer's birthday that every time they celebrated one of the family members, they started the day with a cake waiting on the table, balloons and gifts from each. Right after that they went for a picnic. Ofer is a person of outdoor spaces and of nature: riding his bike with his team, piloting airplanes. This is a man for whom the most antithetical thing is being in the depths of the tunnels of hell.' Eyal added that Ofer's captivity is 'the opposite of what he represents and is normal for him. Ofer is the type of person, even if you haven't spoken to them in a year, within a moment of conversation you will not feel a difference. Even if there is a distance between the conversations, the conversation flows instantly. When he enters the room he immediately smiles and you don't understand why. He spreads light in the room, lightens the atmosphere. He's not just a 'hostage', he's a living and present person, and is so noticeable wherever he is. I'm sure he behaves like this in the tunnels as well.' What did the returned hostages tell you about him? 'We know from all the hostages who returned and were with him in captivity that he helped them a lot and helped them maintain optimism. Just a few days after Sahar and Erez were released, Shani Goren was brought to the area where he was in the tunnels. He seemed optimistic, he said to her, 'I will prepare food for you from what I have here ', adding that he was sure that he would leave in two or three days. It was on his 53rd birthday that he told Sahar when she was taken from him 'Fight for me, I don't want to die in the tunnels.' This is a girl who is now 17 years old and has been carrying this phrase around for a whole year. A girl her age should not hear any of this from one of her parents, and certainly not carry it around so much. She lives with it and we live with the command from heaven that he bequeathed to her and to us. We fight and do not stop for a moment, our duty is simply to return him as soon as possible.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'They haven't even started the rehabilitation process. They are still in a state of temporary survival, they won't be able to do it until Ofer returns,' Eyal says of the hostage's children. 'They were released on the last day of hostage releases and were under the stress of 'yes or no'. We knew they were supposed to be on the list and I was sure that Ofer would also return in a week or so and we would celebrate him with them. Our decision-makers do not understand what the return of the hostages means to our society, to our communities. They are talking about all kinds of security risks, but they pose the biggest risk, which is the integrity of Israeli society.' What will you wish for Ofer? 'Ofer - I wish you would read or hear or see the energies we are sending you on this birthday. Know that we are not giving up for a moment, I swore to your children that I would not give up and I want you to know that we are all a united family and joined together as one strong fist, and we are doing everything and will continue to do everything to bring you back to us and to your loving children, Sahar, Erez, Gaya, Rotem and all your loving family. You will return, recover and help in the rehabilitation of all of us. We will spread your wide and bright light in the world until you return, and you must return, because the world needs the warmth and cheerfulness and joy you spread. You just have to keep surviving and we are on our way to you and we will get there.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk6z2qzxkg	2024-11-24T22:12:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/25/B1GjJWDfT/B1GjJWDfT_0_133_1600_901_0_small.jpg

Senior Hamas terrorist in Jabaliya, Oct. 7 terrorist eliminated	Under the direction of IDF and ISA intelligence, the Israeli Air Force over the weekend struck and eliminated the terrorist Ahmad Abd el-Halim Abu Hussein, responsible for rocket fire in Hamas' Western Jabaliya Battalion, the IDF announced on Monday morning. Abu Hussein was responsible for many rocket and mortar fire attacks against the Israeli citizens and IDF soldiers operating in the Gaza Strip. Multiple other Hamas terrorists were eliminated in the strike, including the terrorist Muhammad Abd al-Rahman Muhammad Zakout, who infiltrated Israeli territory and participated in the October 7 massacre. Meanwhile, during IDF operational activity in southern Lebanon, the troops located large quantities of weaponry and dismantled numerous armed and ready-to-fire launchers directly aimed at Israeli communities in the Galilee area. Over the past day, the IAF struck dozens of Hezbollah terrorist targets in central and southern Lebanon, including command centers, weapons storage facilities, and many Hezbollah launchers, including those that launched projectiles Sunday toward the Haifa Bay and Sharon areas.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjm8lc117ke	2024-11-24T21:23:24-08:00

The report released on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women said the increase was largely the result of more data being available from countries and not more killings.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjxzv511mjl	2024-11-24T21:08:43-08:00

Are 'peaceful protests' becoming hotbeds of antisemitism?	Multiple antisemitic incidents and violent riots have been reported in cities across the U.S. and Canada Multiple antisemitic incidents and violent riots have been reported in cities across the U.S. and Canada. These seemingly 'peaceful protests' often escalate quickly into major violence, with multiple arrests already confirmed. At least four people have been arrested in Montreal, according to Canadian media, after a protest outside a NATO meeting quickly escalated into major violence. Rioters smashed windows of nearby establishments, set cars ablaze, and some were even seen performing Nazi salutes. The violence intensified with clashes against police as pro-Hamas rioters tore through parts of Montreal. The protest also featured the burning of an effigy of the Israeli prime minister, an act that has yet to receive any acknowledgment from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. This follows Trudeau's endorsement of the ICC arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu, where he stated that, as a founding member, Canada will uphold any rulings by the International Criminal Court. Meanwhile, some 300 miles away in Rochester, New York, four university students were arrested and charged with felony criminal mischief after CCTV footage identified them as responsible for hanging viral 'Wanted' posters targeting Jewish staff members across the University of Rochester campus. At Columbia University, silent protestors attended a speech by Israeli Axios journalist Barak Ravid, only to walk out in protest before he began his lecture. Students adorned in keffiyehs marked another demonstration in what has become a regular sight on the Columbia campus. While the Israel Defense Forces continue their mission to rescue hostages still held in Gaza, the international arena is emerging as another front of conflict.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hksaxwbqyg	2024-11-24T17:32:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/13/H1ZjJDyET/H1ZjJDyET_0_0_850_478_0_small.jpg
Is the ICC's case against Netanyahu worse than the Dreyfus affair...	Eugene Kontorovich says the ICC's decision is 'another talking point in a diplomatic war against Israel.' The International Criminal Court (ICC) is a court with no jurisdiction, investigating crimes in a state (Palestine) that does not exist—crimes that never happened, according to Israeli legal expert Eugene Kontorovich. Speaking to ILTV News on Sunday, Kohelet Policy Forum's Kontorovich said the ICC’s decision to issue arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is worse than the infamous Dreyfus Affair. In 1894, Alfred Dreyfus was falsely accused and arrested for passing military secrets to the Germans. 'In the affair of Dreyfus, there was, in fact, spying for the Germans, but it was not done by Dreyfus,' Kontorovich explained. 'In this case, the crime they are accusing Israel of—starvation—simply hasn’t happened at all.' Will there be consequences for Netanyahu and Gallant? According to Kontorovich, that depends entirely on how other countries choose to act. However, he expressed little concern about this aspect. Rather, he views the ICC’s decision as 'another talking point in a diplomatic war against Israel to justify boycotts and create an increasingly diplomatically hostile climate.' 'Whether that succeeds or not is really going to depend on how countries react, in particular, how the United States and Israel react,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1eiai11qkx	2024-11-24T17:21:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2021/02/06/rJoTQKhg00/rJoTQKhg00_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Despite international arrest warrant, Gallant to head to US	Former defense chief set to meet with senior White House and State Department officials in Washington regardless of ICC warrant Former defense minister Yoav Gallant is set to travel to Washington, D.C., next Sunday for talks with senior officials at the White House and U.S. State Department, marking his first visit since the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague issued an arrest warrant against him. The trip comes after a turbulent period for Gallant, who was dismissed from his post by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a reshuffling of government roles. Netanyahu had previously barred Gallant from visiting the U.S., citing the need for better coordination with the Biden administration amid regional security threats, including preparations for Israel's retaliatory strike following Iran's October 1 ballistic missile attack. In early October, Gallant was scheduled for a quick visit to Washington to strengthen U.S.-Israel security coordination. However, Netanyahu postponed the trip, conditioning it on a phone call between himself and President Joe Biden. Shortly after, Netanyahu dismissed Gallant, appointing Israel Katz as the new defense minister. Shortly after his removal, Gallant reiterated his commitment to Israel's security in an X post, writing, 'The security of the State of Israel has been and will always remain my life’s mission.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The White House has criticized the ICC's decision to issue arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials, including Gallant. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby emphasized that the U.S. 'fundamentally rejects' the court’s jurisdiction over Israel, saying, 'We remain deeply concerned by the prosecutor’s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision.' The U.S. is not a member of the ICC and does not recognize its authority, ensuring Gallant faces no legal challenges while in the country. However, concerns linger about potential complications if Gallant’s aircraft requires an emergency landing in a country that enforces the ICC’s jurisdiction. Such a scenario could expose him to legal risks under the arrest warrant. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1hms1111mye	2024-11-24T13:53:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/06/26/HkMMksK8C/HkMMksK8C_0_22_1157_651_0_small.jpg

Life after captivity: Abigail’s new beginning and the long road t...	Abigail Edan, symbol of October 7, celebrates her fifth birthday with her adoptive family after surviving Hamas captivity; her aunt and uncle, who are raising her and her siblings, say, 'She hasn’t changed much, but she’s matured a lot. We’re healing every day' Abigail Edan, abducted from Kibbutz Kfar Aza at the age of three after her parents were murdered, became one of the enduring symbols of the October 7 events. Months after her release in a hostage exchange, a photo of her in the arms of U.S. President Joe Biden touched hearts worldwide. She marked her fourth birthday in captivity, without any family, after her parents, Roy and Smadar, were killed. Her siblings, Michael and Amalia, survived by hiding in a closet during the massacre. On Sunday, Abigail celebrated her fifth birthday, just two days before what has become a second milestone: the anniversary of her release from Hamas captivity. 'She hasn’t changed much, but she’s matured a lot this past year,' said Zuli and Liron, Abigail’s aunt and uncle, who have adopted her and her siblings. 'For all of us, life is divided into before and after October 7. She was already a happy and healthy child, incredibly smart—wise beyond her years. She thinks she’s 16 and has amazing resilience.' Abigail did not want to take part in our project, wisely asking her aunt Liron why people wanted to photograph her. 'I asked if she remembered Emily, Zivi and Gali, Doron and Keith (Damari, Berman, Steinbrecher and Siegel) our friends from the who still haven’t come back home. I explained that we’re doing this for them,' Liron said. 'And then, with her childlike wisdom, she asked, ‘But how will that help?’' 'A year has passed, and the normal thing to think is, ‘How is it possible that they’re still there?’ For me, it’s a miracle that we’re here today, 415 days later, but there are still 101 families waiting for their miracle. This reality is with us every day—it’s the last thing I think about at night and the first thing in the morning.' 'This is why we agreed to this article,' Zuli says. 'Zivi and Gali grew up before our eyes. I remember them as kids playing soccer in our yard. Aviva (Siegel, who returned from captivity while her husband Keith remains a hostage) was my children’s kindergarten teacher. This is our community. We want to show that it doesn’t matter if it’s a four-year-old or a 40-year-old—they all must come home.

That was one of my biggest fears—what would I see after 51 days? I can’t even imagine what it’s like for families still living this nightmare after 415 days.' Zuli and Liron, like many Israelis, never imagined this reality would persist a year after Abigail’s release and nearly 14 months since October 7. As they mark Abigail’s fifth birthday and one year as a new family unit, they acknowledge the challenges ahead. 'We will keep doing what we’ve been doing all year—choosing life,' Liron says. 'Alongside the pain and tragedy, I believe that’s what Roy and Smadar would want for us and our children. A year from now, we’ll be even stronger. People who meet us for the first time often ask which kids are ours biologically, not knowing our story. But that’s not what we focus on. We’re focused on being a family. We have a long road ahead, full of challenges—not just with Abigail, but her siblings, our biological children and everything they experienced that day until we were rescued from our safe room. Our daily work is about healing and recovery as a family, and that process won’t be complete until all 101 hostages are home.' 'This is our life’s mission,' Zuli adds. 'It’s what we do 24/7—helping the kids heal and adjusting to our new family dynamic. It’s important for the public and the state to understand that even when a hostage comes home, the event isn’t over—it’s just beginning. There’s a long road to recovery, and it takes time. We didn’t come home and close the chapter; we’re healing every day, letting the wounds scar over. And that doesn’t happen in a month, or even a year. It’s an ongoing process, and we need the country’s full attention and support to get through it.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r177xzz7jg	2024-11-24T12:16:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/23/rJEfZPskXye/rJEfZPskXye_1_382_852_480_0_small.jpg

Amid war, these Israeli universities shine in global rankings	Eleven Israeli academic departments rank in world’s top 50, per Shanghai Ranking, excelling in mathematics, chemistry and communications; long decline in computer science rankings halted, marking turning point for Israeli universities Last week, the prestigious Shanghai Ranking for academic institutions published its detailed 2024 departmental rankings, and overall, it was a positive year for Israeli academia. The decline in computer science rankings was halted, with the Weizmann Institute’s computer science department breaking into the top 100. Hebrew University climbed to 14th place globally in mathematics, with Israel boasting three universities in the top 100 for the subject. Additionally, Israel’s two technological universities, the Technion and the Weizmann Institute of Science, ranked in the top 40 in chemistry, a highly profitable field. In journalism and communications, Israel emerged as a global leader, with Hebrew University and the University of Haifa both ranked in the top 30. Overall, 11 Israeli academic programs are ranked among the world’s top 50. It was also a strong year in the overall institutional rankings published in August. After several weaker years, three Israeli universities — the Weizmann Institute of Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the Technion — were ranked among the top 100 globally. The Weizmann Institute of Science led Israeli institutions, securing the 69th spot, slightly down from 68th last year. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem climbed from 86th to 81st place, while the Technion dropped from 79th to 85th, resulting in a swap between the two institutions. Additionally, the Technion was ranked 11th among the world’s top technological universities. The Shanghai Ranking, published annually since 2003, evaluates the research performance of academic institutions based on various criteria, including the number of Nobel and Fields Medal laureates among faculty and alumni, the number of scientific papers published in leading journals such as Nature and Science, and other research achievements. The ranking assesses over 2,500 universities worldwide, highlighting the top 1,000. The high status of Israeli academia has become de rigueur, but it is important to remember that Israel is a country of just 10 million inhabitants. When calculating the number of institutions in the top 100 relative to population size, Israel ranks fourth in the world, trailing only Switzerland, Singapore and Denmark, and ahead of countries like France, Germany, the UK and Sweden. Last week, rankings were also published for specific academic departments, including technological fields, which hold special significance for the Startup Nation. The good news is that the decline of Israeli programs in computer science has been halted. The Weizmann Institute, which dropped last year to the 100–150 range (exact rankings are only published for the top 50), returned to the top 100. Ben-Gurion University and the Technion, which also saw declines, regained ground, and the University of Haifa entered the top 100 for the first time. However, Hebrew University's computer science department remains stuck in the 401–500 range. Despite these improvements, Israeli institutions are still far from the high marks of 2018, when the Weizmann Institute ranked 21st and Tel Aviv University was 37th. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: If there is one scientific field where Israel truly excels, it is mathematics. The Hebrew University has advanced significantly, climbing from 25th place in 2020 to 14th. Tel Aviv University ranks 45th, and the Weizmann Institute is close behind in 46th. In 2020, only Hebrew University was in the top 50. Additionally, four other Israeli universities are ranked among the top 500. Israel’s success in mathematics reflects the advantage for universities in fields where costly laboratories are unnecessary, and there is less competition for faculty. Israel’s ability to shine in resource-light disciplines is further evident in its strength in communications and journalism. Since 2020, the Hebrew University has risen from 30th place to 14th, while the University of Haifa has jumped from 42nd to 28th. In chemistry, a field with significant economic potential, Israeli institutions have seen mixed results. The Technion and the Weizmann Institute, previously ranked between 50th and 75th, have made impressive gains, now ranking 32nd and 39th, respectively. However, other universities have struggled. The Hebrew University’s chemistry department is currently ranked between 201 and 300, while Tel Aviv and Ben-Gurion universities are in the 401–500 range. Relatively low ranking in economics In total, Israel boasts 11 academic departments ranked among the top 50 globally. The Hebrew University leads with three subjects: mathematics (14), communications (14), and law (42). While law improved from last year’s rank of 50, it remains well below its 2022 position of 30. The Technion also has three departments in the top 50: chemistry (32), space engineering (40), and electronics engineering (48). The Weizmann Institute is recognized for two: chemistry (39) and mathematics (46). A surprising standout is the University of Haifa, which, despite being ranked between 601 and 700 institutionally, has two departments in the top 50: communication (28) and public management (41). Tel Aviv University has only one subject ranked: mathematics (45). In economics, four Israeli universities are ranked, but only the Hebrew University places in the top 100, at 51–75. Tel Aviv University is ranked between 201–300, while Reichman University recently entered the rankings at 401–500. In business administration, Israeli universities struggle to compete with the high salaries offered by private American institutions. Until 2022, Tel Aviv University was ranked 201–300, but since then, no Israeli university has made the list. Some fields where Israeli universities once excelled have seen declines. In 2021, six Israeli universities ranked among the world’s top 200 in education, with Haifa at 51–75. Today, only two universities—Tel Aviv and Haifa—remain in the top 200, both below 150. Similarly, the Technion’s space engineering department, which ranked 16th globally in 2020, has gradually fallen to 40th. While still impressive, it reflects a notable decline. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjkaiplxjg	2024-11-24T09:38:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2014/03/17/5220254/5220254_36_110_989_557_0_small.jpg
UAE says suspects captured in Chabad emissary's killing	Emirati Interior Ministry announces 'record-time' arrests in murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan, as Iran increases efforts to harm Israeli officials The United Arab Emirates announced Sunday evening the arrest in 'record-time' of suspects in the killing of Chabad emissary Rabbi Zvi Kogan, whose body was discovered Saturday in the city of Al Ain, three days after he was abducted. The suspects, identified as Uzbek mercenaries allegedly hired by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, reportedly fled to Turkey immediately after the murder. UAE officials did not disclose where the arrests were made but emphasized the rapid response as a demonstration of their 'unwavering capability to decisively address any attempts to undermine the security and stability of its society.' The UAE Interior Ministry identified Rabbi Kogan as a Moldovan national 'according to his identification documents at the time of entry into the UAE' and stated that an investigative team was formed immediately upon his disappearance, leading to the identification and arrest of the suspects. According to a statement, 'the UAE and its institutions are fully committed to safeguarding the safety and security of its citizens, residents, and visitors... it will utilize all legal powers to respond decisively and without leniency to any actions or attempts that threaten societal stability. Furthermore, it reaffirmed its readiness to implement all necessary deterrent measures to protect social harmony and peaceful coexistence, strictly adhering to the nation’s laws and regulations.' Terhan's tactics According to investigators, the assailants had tracked Rabbi Kogan's movements before kidnapping him, driving him in his own car to Al Ain, and killing him. Signs of violence and blood were discovered in the vehicle. The suspects reportedly fled to Turkey after the murder. The UAE, working alongside Israeli Mossad agents, has imposed a media blackout on the investigation. Questions remain over Turkey's cooperation, as concerns grow about its emergence as a potential haven for terror cells. These fears follow reports of senior Hamas operatives relocating from Qatar to Turkey. This tactic of using paid mercenaries allows Iran to maintain plausible deniability, a method it has previously employed in attacks on Israeli targets in Thailand, Sri Lanka and Sweden. Officials link the same strategy to a stabbing in the UK targeting Iranian dissident journalist Pouria Zeraati. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the killing, calling it a 'heinous act of antisemitic terror.' He vowed Israel would pursue those responsible, adding, 'We value the UAE's cooperation in this investigation and will strengthen our ties in the face of these attempts to undermine peace.' Defense Minister Israel Katz labeled the killing a 'cowardly and despicable antisemitic act of terror,' while Deputy Minister Uri Maklev emphasized that the incident is 'not merely antisemitism, but a full-fledged terror attack.' President Isaac Herzog expressed solidarity with the Chabad movement, calling the attack 'a stark reminder of the evil faced by the Jewish people.' He thanked UAE authorities for their swift response and voiced confidence that justice would be served. Diaspora Minister Amichai Chikli reassured Chabad emissaries worldwide, pledging Israel’s full support and describing their work as a 'beacon of light and hope for Jews and Israelis everywhere.' Iran's favored targets: Israeli ambassadors Israeli diplomatic missions abroad have raised their alert level to the highest since the October 7 Hamas attack last year, with officials particularly concerned about potential threats to Israeli envoys, especially ambassadors, who are seen as symbols of government authority. Iran and its proxies are considered the primary threat, as ambassadors are viewed as highly vulnerable targets. In the past, Tehran has successfully targeted official Israeli envoys. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In some cases, ambassadors have been prohibited from living in their official residences and are required to move between safe houses. Any activity outside embassy premises now requires security approval, with officials assessing risks ranging from assassination attempts to possible kidnappings. These heightened measures have significantly restricted the movements of ambassadors, sometimes even preventing them from performing basic daily tasks. The restrictions also extend to their families, who face similar precautions. The Foreign Ministry’s Security Division has been operating around the clock since the Hamas attack, which has also fueled a rise in global antisemitism. Security has been reinforced for many Israeli envoys, and in several instances, they have been relocated to other cities or countries due to concerns for their safety. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjrbkjbqkx	2024-11-24T09:17:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/23/S15uN00yXyg/S15uN00yXyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Desperate for troops, Putin manipulates vulnerable Yemenis to fig...	Facing manpower crisis, Moscow recruits Yemeni mercenaries with false promises of high wages and citizenship, only to coerce them into joining army and sending them to fight in Ukraine under unreadable contracts, Financial Times reports Russia has recruited hundreds of Yemeni mercenaries to fight in Ukraine, the Financial Times reported Sunday, in a move that raises concerns over Moscow’s deepening ties with Yemen’s Houthi rebels. The Houthis, an Iran-backed group responsible for attacks on Israel and chaos in the Red Sea, reportedly facilitated the recruitment effort. According to Yemeni nationals interviewed by the newspaper, they were promised high-paying jobs and even Russian citizenship. However, upon arriving in Russia with the help of Houthi-linked organizations, they were forced to enlist in the Russian army and sent to the front lines in Ukraine. This recruitment follows earlier reports of Moscow enlisting fighters from Nepal and India, as well as receiving some 12,000 North Korean troops amid manpower shortages in its nearly three-year war in Ukraine. The Financial Times noted that Russia’s efforts in Yemen underscore its growing alignment with Iran and its proxies amid its confrontation with the West. U.S. Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking confirmed that the Kremlin is actively building ties with the Houthis and has discussed weapons supplies for Yemen. 'We know that there are Russian personnel in Sana’a helping to deepen this dialogue,' he said. 'The kinds of weapons that are being discussed are very alarming, and would enable the Houthis to better target ships in the Red Sea and possibly beyond.' American diplomats have reported in recent months that Russia is also providing the Houthis with information to aid their missile launches. Maged Almadhaji, head of the Sana'a Center for Strategic Studies, a Yemen-focused think-tank, told the Financial Times that the shipments of mercenaries to Russia are organized by the Houthis themselves in an effort to tighten and expand ties with Moscow. Farea al Muslimi, a Gulf affairs expert, added that only a few of the Yemeni mercenaries sent to Russia have any training, and many do not want to go: 'One thing Russia needs is soldiers, and it’s clear the Houthis are recruiting [for them]. Yemen is a pretty easy place to recruit. It is a very poor country.' The newspaper reported obtaining contracts signed by Yemeni recruits, bearing the name of a company identified as a tourism and medical equipment transport company, owned by a prominent Houthi politician. Its investigation indicates that the recruitment of Yemeni soldiers began as early as July. A Yemeni recruit named Nabil told the Financial Times that he was part of a group of about 200 Yemenis recruited to the Russian army in September after arriving in Moscow. He said some were experienced fighters, but many had no military training at all. He recounted that they were deceived and brought to Russia to sign recruitment contracts they could not read. Nabil testified that he was lured with promises of excellent working conditions in 'security' and 'engineering,' hoping to earn enough money to complete his studies. A few weeks later, he found himself with four other fresh Yemeni recruits in a forest in Ukraine, dressed in Russian military uniforms with their faces covered with scarves. 'We are under bombardment. Mines, drones, digging bunkers,' a man is heard saying in a video obtained by the newspaper, reporting that one of his colleagues attempted suicide and was taken to a hospital. According to the Financial Times, the men in the video say they are carrying wooden planks through a mine-filled forest, apparently to build a shelter from the bombings: 'We don’t even get five minutes to rest, we are so tired.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Abdullah, another Yemeni recruited by Russia, told the newspaper that he was promised a $10,000 bonus in addition to a $2,000 monthly salary and eventually Russian citizenship if he worked in Russia manufacturing drones. He arrived in Moscow on September 18 and, along with other Yemenis who arrived with him, was forcibly taken to a facility about five hours from Moscow. There, a man speaking elementary Arabic fired a gun above their heads when they refused to sign recruitment contracts written in Russian. 'I signed it because I was scared,' Abdullah told the newspaper. He said they were then loaded onto buses, underwent basic military training, and were sent to a base near Rostov, close to the Ukrainian border. According to him, many from this group were killed in Ukraine, brought to the war by 'scammers who traffic in human beings'. 'It was all a lie.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryq9eig71e	2024-11-24T08:44:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/24/H1ZpzulX1x/H1ZpzulX1x_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Israeli locksmith fatally shot in robbery in Memphis	Aviv Broek, 21, originally from Rehovot, lured by fake service call; found dead near his car in remote location; police report he was shot four times; no suspects have been arrested An Israeli national working as a locksmith in Memphis was shot and killed on Thursday in what police say was a robbery during a bogus service call. Aviv Broek, 21, originally from Rehovot, Israel, had traveled to the U.S. for work and settled in Tennessee. According to police, Broek was called to change a car lock in the city’s south side. Upon arriving at the location and exiting his vehicle, he was robbed and shot four times in the stomach. Police said Broek did not resist and died on the spot. 'On Thursday evening, around 10:30 p.m., Aviv received a call to change a lock,' Ilai, Broek's friend and co-worker, told Ynet. 'When he got out of the car in an isolated alley, he was robbed and shot four times in the stomach. According to the police, he did not resist or struggle, yet they shot and killed him.' Ilai said that a friend who worked with Aviv located him shortly after. 'They reached him two hours after the shooting. They found him lying on the floor and immediately called the police,' he said. 'They used a location app on their phones, and that's how they found him. As soon as the app stopped working, we started to suspect something was up.' Preliminary findings indicate the suspect who lured Broek to the scene used a disposable phone and selected a remote location near a highway with no security cameras. Police have recovered the phone and recordings of the call between Broek and the suspect, but the shooter’s identity remains unknown. 'I am in contact with the investigator leading the investigation, but at the moment there are still no answers,' said Ilai. 'Not only was he robbed and murdered, but they also took his work equipment worth thousands of dollars, cash and even his passport.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Broek's older brother Rotem told Ynet that 'Aviv always wanted to go to the U.S., open a business and work there. He flew with a friend, initially to Los Angeles, where they worked for about three months, then they moved to Memphis, where they stayed for about six months. They planned to leave, but it was too late. I talked to him about two weeks ago, he was on the road a lot. He said that he was fine, that he was working and making money. He said that there is no antisemitism there, and we don't know if that is the background to the case, but in my opinion it is.' Rotem said the assailants took advantage of his brother’s generous nature. 'He was a giving person, always ready to help others. When they called him, they claimed it was an urgent situation—that someone’s mother was stuck in a car—and offered to pay him double. They lured him into a trap, bringing him to an abandoned house,' Rotem said. 'Despite the late hour, Aviv went to help. He was a man of peace, someone who loved life and new experiences. He was brave and never afraid of anything. This tragedy shocked us. We thought it was safer there than in Israel. Aviv always told us he took care of himself and avoided dangerous places.' In the wake of the incident, Broek’s family and friends launched a fundraising campaign to bring his body back to Israel for burial. The Foreign Ministry confirmed it is aware of the case and stated that the circumstances surrounding the incident are under investigation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rybnwpx7ye	2024-11-24T08:07:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/24/SygLe5e7ye/SygLe5e7ye_2_191_1063_599_0_small.jpg

Iran is preparing to 'respond' to Israel, Ali Larijani, a senior adviser to the country's supreme leader, said in an interview published by Iran's Tasnim news agency on Sunday. On Oct. 26, Israeli fighter jets carried out three waves of attacks on Iranian military targets, a few weeks after Iran fired a barrage of about 200 ballistic missiles against Israel. Iran has previously vowed to respond to Israel's attacks.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjfvf6gmjl	2024-11-24T06:42:44-08:00	
Iran suspected in AI-driven hoax targeting Israeli ministers	Ministers report receiving suspicious invitation to Hanukkah event from purported Chabad figure, later revealed to be fictitious; incident follows mounting threats from Tehran, including killing of Chabad emissary Rabbi Zvi Kogan in UAE Several government ministers, including Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu and Negev and Galilee Minister Yitzhak Wasserlauf from the Otzma Yehudit party, recently received an invitation to an event purportedly hosted by Chabad in New York. Upon further investigation, however, it turned out that the invitation was signed in the name of a fictitious figure, raising suspicions the message was an Iranian attempt to lure government ministers. Estimations now suggest the Iranians, or whoever orchestrated the attempt, used artificial intelligence to fabricate the identity of a rabbi. The individual reaching out from the U.S. possessed a new American cell phone number issued in October. The ministers reported the matter to the Shin Bet in both instances, which began investigating the sender. Senior agency officials informed the ministers that the language of the invitation was likely crafted using artificial intelligence (AI). 'I, Rabbi Yitzchak Shafer, representing the Chabad movement, am honored to invite you to participate in Hanukkah celebrations to be held at the end of December in Brooklyn, New York City. The holiday coincides with the Christian Christmas and the start of the new calendar year,' read the invitation sent to the ministers. 'The event will celebrate the traditions of Hanukkah and include prominent figures from the American-Jewish community, as well as influential political and religious leaders. I respectfully ask for your presence at these remarkable Hanukkah celebrations.' 'If you’re interested and available to attend, I’d appreciate it if you could confirm as soon as possible so we can issue an official invitation from Chabad,' the message continued. 'We’ll also arrange your travel and accommodations for the event. I eagerly await your response. Rabbi Yitzchak Shafer, Chabad.' In one case, a more extended exchange unfolded between the minister and the fictitious figure. 'I work at the Israeli embassy under Ambassador Michael Herzog,' The individual claimed, adding, 'I’m the second secretary at the embassy in Washington, tasked with overseeing cultural and religious matters.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: However, the minister's aide responded, 'I checked with Ambassador Herzog and he doesn’t know who you are.' To this, the figure replied, 'You’re not telling the truth.' The incident comes against the backdrop of Iran's escalating efforts to target and harm Israeli officials. On Sunday, Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a Chabad emissary in the United Arab Emirates, was found dead after being abducted and killed by what authorities believe is an Iranian-linked terror cell. Investigations revealed that three Uzbek operatives, allegedly directed by Iran, followed Kogan after he left his kosher grocery store in Dubai, abducted him and fled to Turkey after killing him. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjcmh11acem1l	2024-11-24T06:25:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/18/B1lfh1Ff1l/B1lfh1Ff1l_153_115_976_550_0_small.jpg

What's Netanyahu waiting for, the next hostage murdered in capti...	Brother of Israeli hostage held by Hamas tells Ynet about the frustrations over government inaction and the focus on war and internal politics; slams Netanyahu for ignoring hostage plight while slamming Shin Bet Kobi Ben Ami, brother of kidnapped Ohad Ben Ami, expressed his deep frustration with the government’s inaction after Hamas released a psychological warfare video claiming a hostage had been killed in captivity In an interview with Ynet on Sunday Ben Ami said he was angry after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu published a nine-minute video defending his close aid Eli Feldstein, suspected of security breaches, without mentioning the hostages. Feldstein was in custody awaiting indictment after he released a misleading report to the German Bild, claiming then Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar would take hostages out of Gaza through the Philadelphy corridor, allegedly to justify Netanyahu's insistence on maintaining IDF presence there, and refusing to agree to a hostage release deal that would include withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Strip. Netanyahu on Saturday posted a 9 minute speech to camera lamenting the incarceration of his aid and spokesperson and claiming the Shin Bet withheld information from him, abused and mistreated the suspect in an effort to target the prime minister. 'Yesterday, they announced the kidnapping of the rabbi in Dubai, then Hamas released a psychological warfare video,' Ben Ami said. 'After that, the prime minister puts out a nine-minute video and doesn’t mention this at all. So where are we at? I keep asking the prime minister, what are you waiting for? The next hostage to be murder in captivity? The next rape in captivity? For a family member to take drastic action?' he asked. 'Why aren’t you, Israel’s leader, responsible for the fate of 101 hostages, doing everything to bring them home? To restore the lives of survivors and bury the murdered? Every citizen in Israel should know this will be their fate should they be kidnapped from their home in their undershirt and underwear. I’m sorry to say this but this is reality.' Marking a year since the only hostage exchange deal in which Raz Ben Ami, Ohad’s wife, was freed, Kobi described her condition. 'Raz returned from the horror of captivity to the reality faced by families of hostages. For a year, knowing what’s happening there, her husband and father of her daughters isn’t home. I’m sorry to say this but her condition worsens by the day — mentally, physically in all aspects.' Ben Ami also addressed Hamas' psychological warfare video, which allegedly showed a hostage murdered in Gaza captivity. The IDF said the information was under review. 'This only underscores the need to finalize a deal and bring them home,' he said. 'It’s unacceptable that for so long, there’s a baby, a child, women, soldiers, and men in captivity and as we see and know, the next murder or rape could happen at any moment.' 'This must end. It’s simply unimaginable. I don’t know what pains me more now — missing my brother or the constant worry that the worst might happen, that I’ll get the next devastating call. It’s an indescribable situation,' he added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The fear is constant, even when Hamas doesn’t release a video or do anything,' he said. 'Now winter is coming and we’ve received reports from doctors and professors that they [the hostages] won’t survive another winter there — they’ll die. People still alive will die. So what are we waiting for? I truly don’t understand. We’re at our wits' end, desperate and frustrated.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1dgatxxyl	2024-11-24T03:13:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/23/Bk0QP5Xfp/Bk0QP5Xfp_1_70_623_351_0_small.jpg

Iran to hold nuclear talks with European powers, report	Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian's government seeks solution to impasse in talks ahead of Trump's second term in office, after IAEA resolution condemns Tehran's continued advances in its nuclear program Iran plans to hold talks about its disputed nuclear program with three European powers on Nov. 29 in Geneva, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported on Sunday, days after the U.N. atomic watchdog passed a resolution against Tehran. Iran reacted to the resolution, which was proposed by Britain, France, Germany and the United States, with what government officials called various measures such as activating numerous new and advanced centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium.

Elon Musk become richest man in history, report	Tech entrepreneur snags new title with a valued net worth standing at over $300 billion; fortune expected to rise following Trump's election victory Elon Musk has broken a historic record, becoming the wealthiest person in history with an estimated net worth of $334.3 billion, Forbes reported on Sunday. Musk's wealth surged by $70 billion in just 20 days —a figure exceeding the annual GDP of several nations. This meteoric rise is attributed to several key developments. Tesla shares climbed 3.8%, reaching a three-and-a-half-year high of $352.56 per share. The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, has reached a valuation of $50 billion, with Musk holding a 60% stake. Another major factor contributing to Musk's wealth increase is U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's election victory. Musk, who donated hundreds of millions to Trump's campaign, is expected to be appointed chair of the 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE), a role aimed at reducing bureaucracy in U.S. agencies. Wall Street analysts predict Tesla will benefit significantly from regulatory relief under a Trump administration, particularly regarding its autonomous vehicle programs. Musk’s net worth is projected to rise even further with an upcoming investment round in SpaceX, which could raise the company's valuation to $250 billion. The gap between Musk and Larry Ellison, the world's second-richest individual, currently stands at more than $80 billion. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Musk's primary sources of wealth include 13% of Tesla shares (valued at $145 billion), 42% of SpaceX (worth $88 billion), and stakes in other companies such as X (formerly Twitter) and Neuralink.

Lebanon's national carrier becomes a source of pride amid war	Middle East Airlines continues to operate flights despite Israeli strikes near Beirut's international airport keeping vital connection open to the world The relentless strikes in Beirut's Dahieh district during the recent months of conflict have not deterred the operations of Lebanon's national carrier, Middle East Airlines (MEA), a fact that has astonished both Lebanese citizens and aviation enthusiasts worldwide. The sight of the airline's planes taking off against the backdrop of smoke billowing from nearby Dahieh sector of the city, a Hezbollah stronghold, inspires immense pride among locals, who watch aircraft navigate the skies amid Israeli attacks. Headquartered at Rafic Hariri International Airport, the Lebanese airline stands alone, as all foreign carriers have suspended flights to and from Beirut, according to an October report by Saudi network Al-Arabiya. MEA has become the sole link between Lebanon's only airport and the wider world. According to reports in the New York Times, MEA was once like any other national airline, facing complaints about flight delays, ticket prices, and the quality of onboard meals. However, since the Israeli strikes targeting Hezbollah sites, the airline has been elevated to the status of a national hero. Its aircraft take off and land mere hundreds of yards from where the strikes are carried out, sometimes shortly after they occur. 'We are not the military. We are not heroes. We are a commercial airline,' a former pilot and spokesperson for the airline told the paper. In recent months, there have been numerous reports of damage in the airport vicinity and on the road leading to it. On November 7, the Qatari publication Al-Arabi Al-Jadid reported minor damage to Beirut's airport and its runways due to the strikes, noting that some aircraft were relocated from runways near Al-Ouzai in Dahieh, which was under attack that day. Lebanese Transport Minister Ali Hamieh said the airport was operating normally. For the Lebanese, maintaining and showcasing continuous operations at the airport during wartime is crucial, as the country grapples with a deepening economic crisis exacerbated by the conflict, striving to maintain some connection with the world and sustain tourism. A passenger who spoke with the French news agency in October recounted flying with the airline on the day Hezbollah's Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah was killed in September. 'I was on the bridge leading to the airport when the explosions were heard. It was a terrifying experience,' she said, adding that she arrived at the airport in a state of panic. Her flight to Cyprus departed on time, and from her window, she could see plumes of smoke rising from Dahieh and the surrounding region. In an interview, she expressed her pride in the Lebanese airline. 'I am proud to be Lebanese and able to fly with my country's airline during war, knowing they will take care of us. I also knew the plane would return with the crew within hours to the war zone.' Lebanon is no stranger to strife. Beirut's airport has weathered multiple conflicts, as has the national airline, founded in 1945. The New York Times said that MEA survived the regional wars of 1967 and 1973, as well as the 15-year civil war that concluded in 1990. The airline continued to operate in 1982 during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and during the Second Lebanon War. In fact, it has become a kind of success story, remaining profitable despite Lebanon's collapse. According to Mazen Al-Samak, head of the Lebanese Private Pilots Association and an aviation safety consultant, a crisis unit was established by the airline and the country's civil aviation authority since the beginning of the Israeli strikes. This unit assesses each flight, and if there is a risk, take-offs are postponed, or pilots approaching Lebanon are instructed to slow down until it is safer to land. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'These are not conditions under which to fly or operate an airport. You cannot find another airport in the world operating under strikes occurring just 500 yards away,' he said. The persistence of the airline has given Lebanon a sense that it is not completely cut off from the world. 'As long as the airport is open, it means we are not completely screwed,' Makram Rabah, a historian at the American University of Beirut, said. 'There is a Mediterranean element here. People living in the Mediterranean always love to go out, whether it's our ancestors, seafarers, or modern transportation. You cannot disconnect Lebanon from the world.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkituvgqjg	2024-11-24T01:12:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/21/H1xc9L2nGkg/H1xc9L2nGkg_464_162_2089_1718_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah's 'diamond': New details on Israeli missile reverse-eng...	According to Israeli security officials the Almas missile poses a real threat to IDF forces; Hezbollah begins manufacturing in Lebanon to reduce Tehran dependency Hezbollah has been using the Almas anti-tank missile, reverse-engineered by Iran from an advanced Israeli anti-tank missile that was captured by Hezbollah during the 2006 Second Lebanon War, the New York Times reported on Saturday. Israeli security officials said that the missile now poses a threat to IDF forces near the border and that Hezbollah has begun manufacturing the missiles inside Lebanon to reduce its reliance on Iran's weapons supply chain. Previous reports have already documented Hezbollah's use of the Almas — (diamond in Arabic and Persian) — developed on the basis of the Israeli Spike missile made by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. According to the report, the reverse engineering was made possible after an entire system of the Spike missile — including a launcher and several missiles — was 'left behind in the field' during the 2006 war. Israeli security officials told the American outlet that after this oversight was discovered during an inventory review of equipment deployed in Lebanon and later recovered or destroyed, Israel recognized a significant risk of the weapon being delivered to Iran, dismantled and reverse-engineered. Iran has previously developed weapons by reverse-engineering U.S. missiles and drones and concerns it would do the same with the Spike missile has ultimately materialized. According to Israeli intelligence, Iran's Almas missile, developed from the Spike, was first deployed during Syria's civil war in the past decade. However, they stressed that Hezbollah's use of these advanced anti-tank missiles during that time was relatively limited. Hezbollah's first public use of the missile was in January when it released propaganda footage of an attack on an IDF naval base in Rosh Hanikra. The terror group has since published additional videos showing missile launches targeting Israeli positions near the border. In one video, a launcher was seen with visible markings that revealed it was manufactured in 2023, suggesting that missiles produced in Iran were quickly delivered to Hezbollah through smuggling routes from Iraq and Syria. Now, according to Israeli security officials who spoke with the outlet, Hezbollah has begun producing the Almas missile domestically in Lebanon, aiming to reduce its dependency on Iranian shipments. Iran continues to manufacture the missile for its own military, and some at Israel’s Alma Research and Education Center fear it could be distributed to other Iranian proxies across the Middle East. 'It’s highly likely that these weapons — both current and future models — will be deployed across the fronts where Iran's proxies operate, posing threats to various high-value targets (not only Israeli) over increasing ranges,' the institute noted in an analysis from April. According to the New York Times, the Almas missile already presents a 'significant challenge' to Israeli forces during the conflict with Hezbollah. Israeli security officials noted that anti-tank missiles of this model were among the advanced weapons systems discovered by IDF troops during ground operations in southern Lebanon. These missiles were described as some of the most sophisticated weapons seized, contrasting with a larger cache of less advanced arms, including Russian-made Kornet missiles. In the same way that the Spike missile was based on advanced anti-tank systems like the American Javelin, the Almas is a state-of-the-art guided missile that 'locks onto' its target. It has a reported range of up to 16 kilometers (10 miles). According to the Alma Research Center, operators don’t need a direct line of sight to launch it as it can be fired from underground or via drones. The institute further highlighted the missile's ballistic trajectory, enabling it to strike targets from above — a point where tank armor is typically more vulnerable. The Israeli research center also identified at least three Almas models, each representing an upgrade over its predecessor. In June, Alma researchers reported that Hezbollah had likely begun using a fourth, more advanced version. Innovations in this model reportedly include the ability to transmit clear images during flight back to operators. According to another research group, CAT-UXO, the Almas can carry two types of warheads: one designed for a two-stage explosion to penetrate armor more effectively and another employing a fuel-air explosive to create a massive conflagration upon detonation.

Fate of Hezbollah's operational chief remains unknown after IDF s...	While Israel believes Muhammad Haidar would not have had time to escape the bombing, his death remains officially unconfirmed; known as Abu Ali, he was a close confidant and advisor to slain Hassan Nasrallah The fate of Hezbollah's chief of operations Muhammad Haidar, who was the target of an Israeli bombing raid on Beirut's Al-Basta neighborhood on Saturday, remains unclear. according to some media reports, he was not in the area at the time of the strike. The sector is nestled in the heart of Beirut, and renowned for its middle-class residents who established their homes there as early as the 19th century. With its rich tapestry of artists, painters, and cartoonists, it continues to be inhabited by their descendants. It is strategically located near the National Museum of Lebanon and government buildings. At the center of Al-Basta, in a once stately eight-story building now reduced to rubble, lived 'Abu Ali,' the high-ranking Hezbollah figure. He was the mastermind orchestrating significant field operations. Due to Haidar's longstanding and special relationship with slain Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, he was appointed to serve in the Lebanese Parliament from 2005 to 2009 to benefit from parliamentary immunity after his alleged involvement in the assassination of Prime Minister Rafic Hariri in 2005. Once the threat subsided, Haidar returned to operational roles within Hezbollah. recent information suggested Haidar collaborated with the Iranian Quds Force overseeing attacks. Following the assassination of Hezbollah’s Chief of Staff, Fuad Shukr, last July, he was thought to be his successor and the head of Hezbollah's Special Operations Division. According to posts on social media, many Lebanese citizens, though anonymously, expressed joy at his possible elimination. Naim Qassem, appointed to replace Nasrallah after serving as his deputy for many years, lacks combat experience. He has never held field positions, and like his predecessor, he remains in hiding. It is likely Israel is closely monitoring his movements, and any attempt at unusual maneuvers might lead to his demise. For now, the new Secretary General subtly endorses the 'experiment' with peace initiatives, while Hezbollah's Jihad Department, which Haidar heads, continues attacks. The case of Haidar, the 'mastermind,' is far more complex. According to foreign reports, as early as 2019, Israel attempted to eliminate him when two Air Force fighter jets dropped bombs on a building in the Dahieh district of Beirut. That attempt failed; others perished, but Haidar survived and strengthened his security perimeter. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: His recent roles included commanding Hezbollah fighters in Syria, providing military advice to the former Secretary General Nasrallah, and overseeing Hezbollah operations against Israel. According to available information, 'Abu Ali' worked tirelessly around the clock. All that remains of the eight-story building on Mamoun Street in the Al-Basta neighborhood are stones. Five bunker-busting bombs left little behind, and those reporting on the event in Lebanon can only marvel at how Israel once again knew precisely where to aim and when 'Abu Ali' entered his apartment, seemingly too close to the time of the bombing to be able to escape. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj7a9lxm1e	2024-11-24T00:09:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/23/S13c0Wym1e/S13c0Wym1e_30_25_476_476_0_small.jpg

Chabad emissary found murdered in UAE	Rabbi Zvi Kogan's body identified after local authorities detect signs of a struggle in his abandoned vehicle; believed to be the victim of Iran-sent terror squad; NSC posts warning to Israelis in or traveling to UAE UAE authorities identified the body of Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a Chabad emissary in Abu Dhabi who was missing since Thursday and believed kidnapped and murdered by Uzbek terrorists acting under orders from Iran. 'The murder of Zvi Kogan, of blessed memory, is an abhorrent act of antisemitic terrorism. The State of Israel will use all means and will deal with the criminals responsible for his death to the fullest extent of the law,' the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) and the Foreign Ministry said in a joint statement. The National Security Council issued a warning to Israelis in or traveling to the UAE to exercise caution after the murder. They are advised to avoid crowded events identified as having Jewish and local participants, keep on alert in public places such as restaurants, avoid obvious Israeli markings, avoid posting travel plans on social media and cooperate with local authorities and immediately report any suspected terrorist presence. Kogan was last seen on Thursday. The Mossad announced an 'intense' investigation in the Emirates after confirming that his disappearance was a terrorist act. It is believed Iran used an Uzbek cell to abduct and murder Kogan, aiming to maintain 'plausible deniability.' The identities of the suspects are known. Kogan served as a soldier in the Givati Brigade of the IDF and was an aide to Rabbi Levi Duchman, the chief rabbi of the Jewish community in the country. His family last heard from him on Wednesday, and according to the Mossad, he was last seen in Dubai on Thursday afternoon. After missing his scheduled meetings and failing to make contact, his wife alerted the Chabad House's security officer, who then informed the authorities, and Israel was updated on the situation. Kogan drove to Al Ain, an inland oasis city on the eastern border with Oman, about an hour and a half from Dubai, where his car was found abandoned with signs of a struggle identified inside, and his phone was turned off. Initial investigations revealed that three Uzbeks followed him after he left the supermarket and are suspected of murdering him. The use of Uzbek Shiite operatives by Iranians is quite common. Israeli authorities are aware the Uzbeks in question flew to Turkey, and Israeli security services will collaborate with Turkish authorities to uncover the truth.

Court remands settler after attack on IDF brass	In the aftermath of the attack on Central Command chief Major Gen. Avi Bluth over the weekend in Hebron, police seeks a five-day remand, granted 2; IDF and police say are prioritizing West Bank settler violence A magistrate court in Jerusalem ruled that a West Bank settlers suspected of violently attacking the military's chief of the Central Command Major General Avi Bluth, in Hebron on Friday, will remain in custody. Police said they were seeking a 5-day remand to investigate but the court granted ruled he will be detained for the next two days. According to officials in the police the matter is considered a high priority and is being investigated alongside other incidents of attacks against IDF troops including the wounding of a soldier. The four suspects face charges including assaulting a police officer, intentional property damage, assaulting a public servant, disorderly conduct in a public setting, and insulting a public servant. During the hearing, a police representative detailed the events: 'The 'Chayei Sarah' Sabbath in Hebron concluded over the weekend, with thousands attending. As part of the operational readiness, Major General Bluth was present in the area. During his tour, dozens surrounded him, shouted derogatory remarks, and attempted to approach him with the intent to assault.' He continued, 'Police and Border Police forces intervened to separate the suspects from the general. During the incident, one suspect assaulted soldiers and police officers, while hurling insults in an attempt to get close to Major General Bluth. The police arrested the suspect, who was then taken to Hebron police station. There, he continued his violent behavior, causing damage inside the cell and making further threats toward the officers.' 'This was a severe and violent incident that was fortunately contained,' the police representative said, I request a five-day extension of the respondent’s detention to complete investigative actions.' The judge acknowledged the substantial evidence in this case. One detainee complained, 'They left us handcuffed all night.' On Friday, Defense Minister Israel Katz announced the cessation of administrative detention orders against settlers, following which at least three incidents involving Jews in the West Bank attacking IDF troops have been recorded. On Friday night, dozens of wayward settlers attempted to assault Major General Bluth in Hebron. On Sunday, approximately 20 settlers threw stones at IDF and Border Police forces near the Itamar outpost, and in another incident, hundreds clashed with forces in Hebron. Eyal Gelman, head of the Hebron local council, condemned the violence, attributing the attack on Major General Bluth to 'a group of intoxicated youths from central Israel.' He stated, 'During the Sabbath, many prayers were held for total victory, for the success and protection of our soldiers, and for the return of the captives. We strongly condemn any violence, especially against our brothers in the IDF and all security forces. I have urged the Israel Police to fully prosecute these few rioters.'

Jonathan Pollard’s six principles of war	Former Israeli agent tells ILTV, 'We have to pursue a policy of annihilation towards the enemy.' Former Israeli agent Jonathan Pollard, who made aliyah in December 2020 after serving 30 years in a U.S. prison, has become a provocative voice in Israel's public discourse. Despite his soft-spoken demeanor, Pollard’s words carry significant weight, delivered with unflinching conviction. Last week, he stirred the conversation further in an exclusive ILTV News podcast interview. Over the course of a 30-minute, one-on-one discussion, Pollard offered unfiltered and controversial perspectives on Israel's most pressing security challenges. He issued a scathing critique of any potential ceasefire with Hezbollah—calling instead for decisive victory—and outlined his vision for bolstering Israel's military self-sufficiency. He also addressed preemptive warfare, nuclear deterrence, and what he described as the peril of 'weaponized compassion.' 'We have to adopt a new core doctrine of six principles,' Pollard told ILTV. 'And the first principle is the readoption of preventive and preemptive warfare against perceived threats.' In other words, he argued, Israel must strike its enemies before they can attack. The second principle, he explained, is that Israel should fight its battles on enemy territory rather than its own. 'There is nothing new here,' he contended. 'It’s a policy [former Israeli Prime Minister David] Ben-Gurion first started and that we’ve forgotten about.' Third, Pollard insisted that Israel must abandon the notion of proportionality. Fourth, he argued that Israel must stop 'managing' the enemy. 'We have to stop mowing the grass,' Pollard explained. 'We have to stop attempting to reach ceasefires. We have to pursue a policy of annihilation towards the enemy. They have to be utterly and decisively eliminated.' The fifth principle, according to Pollard, is Israel's acknowledgment of its right to use nuclear weapons if deemed necessary. Finally, the sixth principle is the acceptance of annexation. 'If you come to fight us, we’re not only going to annihilate you by whatever means, but we're also going to take your land,' Pollard stressed. 'This is something that most people understand in war: You lose, you lose your land or parts of it. And this is something, for example, in Gaza and in southern Lebanon that I firmly believe we should act upon.' War should end with victory and defeat Israel has been waging war on its southern and northern borders since October 7. As the war enters its 14th month, polls show that the people of Israel want the hostages home and the fighting to end. However, proposed U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreements have been met with skepticism on all sides, including the proposed deal between Israel and Lebanon. Pollard is an outspoken critic of such ceasefire deals. Quoting author and former MK Einat Wilf, he argued that wars should end with victory and defeat—'hopefully victory for our side and defeat for our enemy,' Pollard said. 'We have to get back to this notion of decisiveness in warfare,' Pollard asserted. 'Our children, our husbands, our wives are on the frontlines—not just on the battlefield, but in our cities as well now. And because of that, our doctrine, our war doctrine, has to reflect the fact that we cannot waste anybody… We have to fight for a decisive end to the conflict. We can't bequeath the conflict to our children or grandchildren or great-grandchildren. 'A ceasefire, as far as I'm concerned, allows Hezbollah to walk away with a win.' Pollard also expressed his belief that the hostages should not be returned if it means giving Hamas in Gaza a victory. His statement came just days before the Hamas terrorist organization released footage that allegedly showed Israeli hostage Daniella Gilboa being killed. Gilboa was one of the IDF observer soldiers abducted from the Nahal Oz army base on October 7. The IDF reported that it was investigating the footage but had not yet been able to verify or refute its authenticity. Of the more than 250 individuals abducted on the day of the massacre, 101 hostages are still being held in Gaza. The IDF has stated that at least one-third of the hostages are believed to be deceased. 'Where we have hostages, we cannot end this war allowing our enemies to succeed in using hostages to their advantage,' Pollard told ILTV. 'It's difficult for me to talk about this, because I know what it's like to be incarcerated. I know what it's like to be tortured. I know what it's like to be abandoned. So my heart goes out to the families of the hostages and the hostages themselves. But unfortunately, hard decisions sometimes have to be made, and we have to admit that the way we end this war will set a precedent for the future. 'We cannot continue to endanger the lives of our people by allowing our enemies to weaponize our love for each other,' Pollard said. 'We cannot allow our hostages to be weaponized against us, our love to be weaponized against us. We cannot allow our compassion for innocent civilians to prevent us from destroying the enemy.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1wigmeqyg	2024-11-23T17:38:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2020/12/30/SysZUtYpw/SysZUtYpw_0_0_640_360_0_small.jpg
IDF veteran and UAE chief rabbi's aide: Concerns mount over missi...	Days after Rabbi Zvi Kogan vanished, UAE acknowledges case but referrs to him as 'Moldovan national'; suspicions point to Iranian-backed Uzbek terror cell accused of killing Kogan and fleeing to Turkey Concerns are growing over the fate of Chabad emissary Rabbi Zvi Kogan as the United Arab Emirates addresses his disappearance for the first time. Hours after Mossad announced that Kogan had been missing since Thursday in what it described as a terror attack, the UAE’s Interior Ministry issued an official statement. Notably, the statement made no mention of Kogan’s Israeli identity. In the statement, the ministry confirmed that his family reported 'that he has been missing and out of contact since last Thursday' and that 'the specialized authorities immediately began search and investigation operations upon receiving the report.' The statement referred to Kogan as a 'Moldovan national,' reflecting his dual citizenship. The ministry urged the public to rely on official sources for updates and to 'avoid heeding malicious rumors or misleading news aimed at causing confusion.' Kogan had served in the IDF's Givati Brigade. He is a close aide to Rabbi Levi Duchman, the chief rabbi of the Jewish community in the UAE and managed the kosher grocery store Rimon in Dubai where he was filmed just days before he was last seen. A preliminary probe into his disappearance suggests that three Uzbek operatives tailed him after he left the grocery store and drove to Al-Ain, approximately 90 minutes from Dubai where his car was later found abandoned and his phone had been switched off. According to suspicions, he was likely kidnapped and murdered by the Uzbek terror cell, which was allegedly directed by Iran to provide Tehran with plausible deniability. These operatives subsequently fled to Turkey. Israeli intelligence agencies are expected to coordinate with Turkish authorities to pursue leads. The Iranians’ use of Uzbek Shiite terrorists is widespread, and they have also operated in Dubai. Last month, Germany announced the closure of all three Iranian consulates on its soil in response to the execution of Jamshid Sharmahd, a dual German-American citizen and opposition figure who was abducted by Iran in 2020.

His family reported their last contact with him was on Wednesday, prompting his wife to alert Chabad’s security officer when he failed to attend scheduled meetings.

Missing Chabad emissary’s car found abandoned; suspected killed b...	Mossad confirms terror attack; preliminary findings suggest 3 Uzbek operatives tailed Rabbi Zvi Kogan after he left his grocery store, killing him and fleeing to Turkey; Israeli intelligence agencies expected to coordinate with Turkish authorities to pursue leads The disappearance of Chabad emissary Rabbi Zvi Kogan in the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday is now being treated as a terror attack, Israeli intelligence sources said on Saturday. Mossad announced an 'intensified investigation' after concluding that Kogan, who managed the kosher grocery store Rimon in Dubai, was likely kidnapped and murdered by an Uzbek terror cell allegedly directed by Iran to maintain plausible deniability. Kogan, a close aide to Rabbi Levi Duchman, the chief rabbi of the Jewish community in the UAE, was last seen in Dubai on Thursday afternoon. His family reported their last contact with him was on Wednesday, prompting his wife to alert Chabad’s security officer when he failed to attend scheduled meetings. Investigators believe Kogan drove to Al-Ain, approximately 90 minutes from Dubai, where his car was later found abandoned. His phone had been switched off, and preliminary findings suggest three Uzbek operatives tailed him after he left the grocery store. These operatives, now believed to have killed Kogan, subsequently fled to Turkey. Israeli intelligence agencies are expected to coordinate with Turkish authorities to pursue leads.

Known for its comprehensive surveillance infrastructure, the UAE is regarded as the most monitored country in the world, with extensive closed-circuit cameras tracking nearly every street, raising hopes for a breakthrough in the case. Kogan, who married six months ago to a niece of Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg, the Chabad emissary killed in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, was a prominent figure in the Jewish and Israeli community in the UAE. A local Israeli resident described him as 'a kind and active member of the community' and said his disappearance has left his family and the community devastated. The Prime Minister's Office, on behalf of Mossad, issued a statement: 'Zvi Kogan, an Israeli-Moldovan citizen and Chabad emissary residing in the United Arab Emirates, has been missing since Thursday afternoon. Following his disappearance and based on information suggesting a terrorist event, an intensive investigation has been launched in the UAE. 'Israeli intelligence and security agencies are working tirelessly out of concern for his safety and well-being. It should be noted that the National Security Council previously issued a Level 3 travel warning (moderate threat) for the UAE, advising against non-essential travel and recommending heightened precautions for those currently in the country.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry3gtskqyx	2024-11-23T10:24:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/23/r1l7DAwkX1g/r1l7DAwkX1g_0_0_831_468_0_small.jpg
That document should have been on my desk': Netanyahu accuses se...	In defense of embattled spokesman, PM lashes out at allegations of leaking classified information, calling investigation politically motivated and likening it to Israel’s broader battles on multiple fronts Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a nine-minute statement on Saturday evening accusing security agencies of withholding critical information, following reports of a Hamas strategy document leaked by workers in his office. In the video, Netanyahu launched a fierce defense of his spokesman, Eli Feldstein, who has been indicted for allegedly leaking classified information to harm national security. 'Eli Feldstein is a patriotic Israeli and an ardent Zionist. There is no chance he would knowingly endanger the security of the state,' Netanyahu said, responding to allegations that have exposed close ties between Feldstein and the prime minister's senior advisers. Netanyahu cited an infamous remark by one of his senior aides calling Feldstein's actions 'boss-approved.' In a dramatic escalation, Netanyahu compared the investigation into the leaked document to Israel's current military situation, saying, 'We are fighting on seven fronts, and this is another front.' In an unprecedented claim, he accused the security establishment of withholding critical intelligence from him. Military officials rejected Netanyahu’s assertion, responding, 'The security agencies do not withhold information from Netanyahu or any prime minister.' They clarified that intelligence undergoes a formal filtering process, ensuring relevant details are shared with decision-makers. 'Raw material is not provided to every official,' they added, noting that aides can request deeper access to original data if needed. Netanyahu also took aim at the ongoing investigation, calling it selective and politically motivated. 'No investigations were launched over previous leaks,' he said. 'Suddenly, we have an investigation over one leak—a document revealing Hamas' strategy to divide Israeli society. That document should have been on my desk. Instead, I was excluded from receiving it.' The prime minister condemned the accusations against Feldstein and an IDF reservist implicated in the case, suggesting the charges were designed to damage him personally. 'This witch hunt will not deter me,' Netanyahu said. Addressing their families, he expressed sorrow, saying, 'It pains me that your sons are being used as pawns in a political game.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Referring to Feldstein as a reserve captain and devout Zionist, Netanyahu decried the treatment of the accused: 'If masked men arrest you in the dead of night, isolate you, shackle you and threaten you with life imprisonment, anyone could break under such pressure—even falsely confess to murder.' Netanyahu accused investigators of employing intimidation tactics, comparing the situation to past cases where initial allegations evaporated in court. 'I read the indictment, and it's clear the reservist also believed that critical documents were not reaching me,' he added, reiterating that withholding such materials from the prime minister is 'a severe issue.' Expressing outrage over the treatment of the suspects, Netanyahu said, 'Young people are being treated like the worst terrorists—held for days without access to a lawyer, their basic rights trampled.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sksbboyqjl	2024-11-23T09:56:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/23/Hy8hvYJQyg/Hy8hvYJQyg_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Terror group posts footage claiming to show Israeli hostage killed in captivity; military says cannot confirm or deny claim at this stage and the public to ‘refrain from spreading rumors’ Hamas on Saturday released images it claimed showed an Israeli hostage killed in captivity in Gaza. The IDF said it is investigating the claim, saying, 'At this stage, we cannot confirm or deny' the information. The IDF said it is in contact with the hostage's family and has provided them with updates. 'Hamas continues to engage in psychological terror and act with extreme brutality. Please refrain from spreading rumors and information that may harm the families of the hostages,' the IDF added. The release of the video coincides with the one-year anniversary of the hostage exchange deal. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum responded to the report of the hostage’s alleged death, saying: 'We’ve seen the heavy toll rumors have taken in the past. The pain for families is unbearable. We ask the public to avoid any direct or indirect contact with families. Official updates will only come from authorized sources. It has been 414 days since the hostages were taken into Hamas’ death tunnels. Twenty-seven have already been killed in captivity. How much longer must we wait for their return?' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Gil Dikman, a cousin of Carmel Gat, who was killed in captivity, posted on X (formerly Twitter): 'As someone who knows firsthand, receiving a rumor with your relative’s name listed among the dead without knowing the truth is the most devastating thing.

In addition to Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) last week released two videos featuring captive Sasha Trupanov, who has been held in Gaza for 414 days. The most recent video was published last Friday, two days after another video of Trupanov was released. The latest footage showed Trupanov speaking, with an image of Shas Party leader Aryeh Deri in the background. Trupanov, who marked his 29th birthday last week, was seen speaking on camera for over three minutes in the previous video. Earlier this year, in May, PIJ released two other videos featuring Trupanov (video 1 | video 2). Security experts believe the messages in the videos are dictated by the captors as part of their psychological warfare campaign against Israel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj6gpc1xjx	2024-11-23T09:20:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/10/ByRpoMCh0/ByRpoMCh0_84_0_2186_1231_0_small.jpg

Israeli strike on Beirut fails to kill Hezbollah operations chief...	Muhammad Haydar, Hezbollah’s de facto military chief, reportedly survives attempt on his life; at least 11 reported dead and dozens injured in strike An Israeli airstrike early Saturday in Beirut failed to eliminate Muhammad Haydar, Hezbollah’s de facto military chief, Saudi outlet Al-Hadath reported, citing Israeli security sources. Haydar, who rose to prominence after a series of assassinations of top Hezbollah leaders, was reportedly targeted in the strike but was not present in the building. Hezbollah officials denied Haydar’s presence at the site, telling Al-Hadath that 'no senior Hezbollah commander was in the targeted building,' while Lebanese media reported at least 11 deaths and dozens of injuries. The strike destroyed an eight-story residential in central Beirut, with extensive damage reported to adjacent buildings. Civil defense teams were said to be struggling to retrieve victims from the rubble. Lebanon’s state news agency reported that five bunker-busting bombs were used in the attack, creating a massive crater. Footage from the scene showed widespread destruction, with the targeted building reduced to rubble. Hezbollah-affiliated Al Mayadeen reported that the building was 'crowded with people' at the time of the attack. The airstrike coincided with rocket fire from Lebanon into northern Israel, triggering air raid sirens in Haifa and surrounding areas.

Meet Trump's new Mideast envoy	Steve Witkoff made a fortune in real estate is a decades-long friend of Trump's that is know to be a smart negotiator who will have direct access to the president Compared to other real-estate, oil and tech magnates billionaires who surround Donald Trump, Steve Witkoff is described as a modest man. According to the Palm Beach Post he is worth around $500 million deriving from his 51 properties in London, Miami and New York. Contrary to most of those billionaires, Witkoff has also been Trump's real friend for the past 40 years. Trump trusts him completely and has now appointed him to be his special Mideast envoy. Like Trump Witkoff is a New Yorker who made his fortune there, brought his children into the business and then began spending half his time in south Florida. He is an avid golfer and has played with the president-elect during the second assassination attempt on Trump's life last September. The two men met in 1986 when Witkoff, then a young real-estate lawyer, worked for Traub & Dreyer, a city firm that had Trump as a client. They bumped into each other at a local delly and later worked together on a deal. 'Trump did not have cash so I treated him to a pork sandwich, Witkoff once said. According to his son, Alex, Trump was 'one of the greatest inspirations,' that motivated his father to move from law to real-estate. Their relationship grew closer over the years, through tragedies as well. Witkoff said Trump stood by him when his youngest son Andrew, died of an opioid overdose in 2011. 'His presence brought real solace in a dark hour,' he said during his speech to the Republican National Conference this summer, calling him the kindest and most compassionate man. Witkoff also played the part of peacemaker and ironing out personal disputes between Trump and political adversaries such as Ron DeSantis or Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, resulting in both eventually endorsing Trump for president. The 67-year old native of the Bronx grew up in Long Island, is the son of a coat maker who made good in New York's 1980's real estate world. He married Lauren Rappoport and the couple had three boys Zak, Alex and Andrew, who died of an overdose. In recent years his company enjoyed the property boom in Florida including the Shell Bay club which is described as like Trump's Mar-a-Lago but much nicer. The company earned a reputation of succeeding in property deals where others have failed. One such deal is the high-end South Beach club in Miami where a penthouse was recently sold for $120 million. His success may be why Trump picked him to step into the roll previously occupied by his son-in-law Jared Kushner. Trump views the Middle East conflict not as a centuries-old religious war but a complex real estate deal that must be worked out. Witkoff who is Jewish, and an avid supporter of Israel agrees. Since the massacre of Oct. 7 last year, he has been Trump's unofficial envoy to the American Jewish business community and said he himself received and helped ensure considerable donations to the campaign. Although he has no diplomatic experience, his friends point to the business contacts he has built in the region, including in Israel. Last year Witkoff sold the Park Lane Hotel in Manhattan to the Qatari government's investment fund for $623 million. The Abu Dhabi fund was also involved in the deal. His colleagues in the real-estate world describe him as smart, accessible and a talented negotiator whose style is not to make the other side an adversary, another close ally of Trump said in an interview. He said he was not looking to see blood on the floor before a deal is agreed. Whether that would suffice when negotiating an end to the conflict in our region, remains to be seen but one thing is certain, Witkoff will have direct access to Trump's ear.	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rjwkjv1q1e	2024-11-23T05:08:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/21/HydTuC3fke/HydTuC3fke_1_128_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Iran’s much long hidden collection of Western art re-emerges desp...	Eye to Eye' exhibit draws women, their hair uncovered, to the underground galleries of the museum in Tehran’s Laleh Park with a collection likely worth billions of dollars As Iran faces increasing tensions with the West and turmoil at home, a new exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art is displaying Western artwork including pieces not seen by the public in at least a decade. The unveiling of the exhibition 'Eye to Eye' has drawn numerous women, their hair uncovered, to the underground galleries of the museum in Tehran’s Laleh Park. Their presence, while unacknowledged by authorities, shows the way life has changed inside Iran just in the last few years even as the country’s theocracy presses forward with enriching uranium to near-weapons grade levels and launching attacks on Israel during the ongoing Mideast wars. 'The first feeling that came to me, and I told my parents, was that I can’t believe I’m seeing these works, which have always been kept far from our eyes,' said Aida Zarrin, a young woman at the museum. 'If such events are held here and we can see artworks like the rest of the world, it’s enough. They are really precious.' The government of Iran’s Western-backed shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and his wife, the former Empress Farah Pahlavi, built the museum and acquired the vast collection in the late 1970s, when oil boomed and Western economies stagnated. Upon opening, it showed sensational works by Pablo Picasso, Mark Rothko, Claude Monet, Jackson Pollock and other heavyweights, enhancing Iran’s cultural standing on the world stage. But just two years later, in 1979, Shiite clerics ousted the shah and packed away the art in the museum’s vault. Some paintings — cubist, surrealist, impressionist and even pop art — sat untouched for decades to avoid offending Islamic values and the appearance of catering to Western sensibilities. Nearly everything is believed still to be there, though an Andy Warhol print of the empress was slashed during the revolution. Today, the collection is likely worth billions of dollars. Even with Iran now cash-strapped under Western sanctions, officials with the museum have been able to advocate for keeping the collection, though there have been occasional trades in the past for items from Persian history. Those sanctions may increase under the next administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. As Iranian politics have thawed, re-frozen and thawed again, the collection resurfaces along with those changes. Among the over 120 works being shown are ones from Picasso, Andy Warhol and Francis Bacon, along with celebrated Iranian artists. One of the Warhols, 'Jacqueline Kennedy II,' is a silkscreen double image of the former U.S. first lady in mourning after the 1963 assassination of her husband, President John Kennedy. Another Warhol portrait of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger also garnered attention from the cellphone photo snappers. 'A lot of these works are important works in the history of art, and that’s why this show distinguishes itself from others,' said Jamal Arabzadeh, the exhibition’s curator. 'A lot of people with less exposure to art have discovered the museum for the first time. ... We are seeing a part of the community that are discovering art and the museum and see the potential of this place, and this is something to be proud of.' The presence of Western art comes as Iran’s government has long fought against items like Barbie dolls and depictions of cartoon characters from 'The Simpsons.' Such Western influences have been deemed un-Islamic in the past and have been seen as part of a 'soft' cultural war against the Islamic Republic. With a ticket costing the equivalent of 14 U.S. cents, the exhibition offers a rare government-sanctioned event not involving the country’s politics or Shiite religion. Among the visitors were many women defying the country’s mandatory headscarf, or hijab, law. Crackdowns over the hijab have slowed down after Iran’s presidential election in July that elected reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, though individual cases of arrest continue to draw anger. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: And for many, the cost of tickets to travel abroad given Iran’s collapsing rial currency keep foreign museums out of reach. 'This is very attractive for art enthusiasts because not everyone can go and see museums abroad. It’s extremely exciting to see the works here,' said a woman who only gave her last name, Dolatshahi. 'I had no idea I could see works by van Gogh and Picasso here.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sysf88jm1e	2024-11-23T04:36:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/23/B1jHOLyQ1e/B1jHOLyQ1e_0_0_3000_1999_0_small.jpg

IDF targets Hezbollah chief of operations in Beirut strike, repor...	Muhammad Haydar, a former member of parliament, described as the strategic and security brain of Hezbollah's operations and its military chief, after the assassination of many of the terror-group's senior commanders The IDF strike on Beirut early on Saturday targeted Muhammad Haydar, Hezbollah's chief of operations, Sky News Arabic reported citing Israeli officials. Haydar, a former member of parliament, was a close advisor to slain leader Hassan Nasrallah, assassinated in an attack on the Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut in September. The IDF considered him chief of the terror group's military after a string of assassinations of top Hezbollah commanders. He has been leading the organization in recent months and sources tod the Saudi Arabia Al Hadath channel that he was the strategic – security brain behind Hezbollah's war with Israel. According to reports in Lebanon, the military used bunker busting bombs in the strike that brought down an 8-storey building and created a crater. At least 11 people were killed and more wounded but Lebanese health officials said they expected the death toll to rise because teams were struggling to pull survivors from the rubble. The strike came without warning, as was the practice of the IDF, in the pre-dawn hours, while at the same time, Hezbollah fired 5 rockets at Haifa and its surrounding areas. Later the military warned residents of the Dahieh to leave ahead of an Israeli strike.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s12qag17yg	2024-11-23T00:32:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/23/BJ8bff17yg/BJ8bff17yg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

It’s not rockets destroying Israel—it's this	ILTV's Insider: Is Israel, as some have said, a nation in trauma? Since 6:29 a.m. on October 7, 2023, Israelis have found themselves on a relentless journey of trauma. Each day since that fateful morning has been punctuated by sirens, artillery fire, and the ever-present echoes of grief and fear. The massacre at the Nova Music Festival and the atrocities across towns and villages in Israel’s south left scars that extend far beyond the physical, searing into the national psyche. The horror of those events—and the propaganda that followed—was not just an assault on Israel but an attack on the very fabric of humanity. On Insider, ILTV News and guests confront the unspoken aftermath: The enduring psychological toll on individuals and a society grappling with loss, fear, and uncertainty. Is Israel, as some have said, a nation in trauma? How do survivors begin to heal? And what would it take to construct a 'mental health Iron Dome' to protect our collective well-being? To help answer these questions, ILTV interviews four guests: Prof. Mark Weiser, director of the Psychiatric Rehabilitation Center at Sheba Medical Center Manny Waks, host of the podcast PTSD Nation and a passionate mental health advocate Tomer Zadik and Yoav Haver, Nova Festival survivors Watch Insider: View previous episodes >>	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjzsrwymjx	2024-11-22T22:42:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/06/rJl4IuAprT/rJl4IuAprT_2_0_1919_1080_0_small.jpg

Bella Hadid cried when I told her about October 7'	Israeli designer Brit Shaked shares insights from behind-the-scenes interactions with Bella and Gigi Hadid, despite their anti-Israel stance; reveals challenges of haute couture, navigating competitive fashion world Israeli designer Brit Shaked is celebrating eight years since graduating from Shenkar College of Engineering, Design and Art and moving to New York. She lives in the Big Apple with her partner Ofer and their daughter Rena, who attends a Chabad daycare. 'Ofer and I grew up just 10 minutes apart in Israel, and we have mutual friends back home, but we somehow had to come here to meet,' says Shaked, 32, who recently fulfilled a dream by leading the design and couture production for Victoria’s Secret’s highly anticipated fashion show in New York, the brand's first in six years. Behind the scenes, among angel wings and international supermodels like Gigi and Bella Hadid, Shaked says she remained true to her Israeli roots. 'There was a lot of criticism online about me working with the Hadid sisters, but I didn’t have a say in the matter,' Shaked explains. 'I was chosen to manage this massive project, and they were part of the team of top models, alongside even bigger names like Carla Bruni, Kate Moss, Cher, Adriana Lima, and Tyra Banks. I didn’t treat Bella and Gigi any differently than the others. Instead of avoiding dialogue, as many expected, I saw working with them as an opportunity to speak from a position of strength about the events of October 7.' What do you mean by ‘a position of strength’? 'The fashion world may seem glamorous from the outside, but at the end of the day, everyone is human, with insecurities and fears. All the models care deeply about how they look and are terrified of tripping on the runway during the live show. They crave emotional support and reassurance, just like anyone else. Meeting them for the first time is exciting, but once I start working, I’m the one who ensures they feel comfortable so they can perform their best.' How do you manage to make the Hadid sisters feel at ease while dealing with such conflicting emotions? She laughs. 'I’m an Israeli with an Israeli accent, I served in the army, and I don’t hide who I am. But I separate my work from my personal beliefs. It’s incredibly difficult to detach from our feelings as Israelis, especially since October 7, but when you strip away the public image, the models are surprisingly human. One of them is a mother, and so am I.' What kind of criticism did you face online for working with them? 'The comments were harsh: ‘How dare you. You have blood on your hands.’ But I succeeded in sitting with them one-on-one. I told them I was in Israel on October 7 for a family wedding that was canceled due to the war, and I stayed there for a while with my baby during an extremely traumatic and frightening time. I shared the loss and grief we’ve all felt, how everyone in Israel knows someone who has been impacted. Though the conversation was brief, I felt empowered to expose them to our suffering. Bella even cried when I told her my story.' She cried? She should delete her Instagram. 'I brought that up, too. It was my chance to say, ‘What you’re doing on social media is hurting so many people.’ If I had refused to work with her, I wouldn’t have had the opportunity to say it. And I wouldn’t have achieved anything by being confrontational. When I came to their fittings, I had a lot of animosity toward them, and I was even disappointed that they were polite and human toward me. I don’t know if it was genuine, but they’re professionals. You don’t reach their level without being highly professional.' Shaked also held her ground with other celebrities known for their lack of support for Israel, such as Iman and Paloma Elsesser. 'Again, my strength came from the fact that they were models before a critical show and needed my help in their most stressful moments. Right before the show, they came to me in tears from the pressure, and I was able to have a profound impact on them. Despite what they think, I was there as an Israeli and a Jew, and they needed me. That’s why I think the criticism of ‘You shouldn’t have worked with them’ is misguided. The victory is being present, not disappearing. We have more influence from within, not from the outside.' What about the Hadid sisters’ prominence on social media? 'In Israel, people blow their influence out of proportion. Yes, they have a significant following, but in the show I managed, they were just two of many models, including the wonderful Israeli model Sun Mizrahi. The Hadid sisters weren’t special in any way—one opened the show, and the other closed it.' What’s your view on haute couture in Israel? 'Unfortunately, many people in the Israeli fashion industry work for free. It’s hard for me to even mention the sums I earn in New York. There’s no couture in Israel; there aren’t the budgets to execute grand projects, and there’s little value placed on art. When I create a moving garment, I get responses like, ‘Why do I need this?’ or ‘I can’t wear that.’ People in Israel understand the concept of art on a wall, but they don’t grasp paying $10,000 for a dress that’s a work of art.' Do you understand the concept? 'Yes, because I know what it takes and what it offers. Cities like Paris, Milan, and New York have industries built around this, generating millions. There are people who seek unique pieces, and they sell. But let’s face it, succeeding financially in haute couture is challenging. Many celebrities expect designers to work for free, saying, ‘I’m a celeb; design for me, and I’ll tag you online.’ Early in your career, it’s a fair trade—I did plenty of free work for credit because you need the experience and exposure.' Why not shift to commercial fashion entirely? 'I tried, and it made me very unhappy. When you’re a creative designer and have to compromise your art, it’s stifling. For two years, I worked in commercial fashion, and I realized I didn’t aspire to the roles above me. It was demoralizing. On the other hand, I need to make a living. Living in New York with two kids is expensive. So at first, I took unpaid projects for the sake of my creativity while doing other jobs to make ends meet. Now, I constantly look for projects to reinvent myself without compromising too much, which is tough. It’s hard to sit in a room and say, ‘This is my price. I’m worth it,’ knowing some might say I’m delusional.' What advice would you give aspiring Israeli designers? 'There’s still an issue in Israel. The industry relies on Shenkar graduates who are eager to succeed and offers unpaid opportunities, saying, ‘Your design will make it into Vogue.’ I understand that—early in your career, you have to support yourself with other jobs and build experience because this field is experience-driven. But once you’ve gained experience, you must stand your ground and demand fair compensation for your talent and hard work.' Born in New York while her parents studied there, Shaked returned to Israel at age three. Her parents, both in tech, always supported her passion for fashion, which began early. She recently shared on Instagram, 'The 10-year-old me is screaming inside. I can’t believe this is real. When I was offered the role of designing the couture pieces and wings for the Victoria’s Secret show, I thought it was a joke. Today, after zero hours of sleep, a broken back, and severe separation anxiety from my daughter Rena, I’m living a dream I never dared to dream because it felt too big. This massive production, on a scale I couldn’t imagine, gave me a sense of fulfillment and relief that it’s over, and I can return to my life. Even after thinking I couldn’t do it as a mom and pregnant, I proved it’s possible. From cutting fruit for daycare to fitting Tyra Banks, Cher, and Adriana Lima—it’s all doable. And in these dark days, being Israeli and Jewish in such an influential role is my greatest victory.' How did you handle managing a multimillion-dollar budget while pregnant? 'It’s tough, but I worked hard to leave personal matters at home. No one in this industry wants to deal with your personal or medical issues. I learned the rules quickly. For example, there’s no maternity leave here unless you work for a very structured company. Most of my colleagues don’t have or want kids. In fashion, children aren’t the norm, so I manage motherhood quietly, relying on support from loved ones like my husband, who works as a carpenter in his family’s business. Doing all this with a toddler and being pregnant was challenging, but not everyone gets such an opportunity, which is also a financial lifeline.' Shaked prefers to stay behind the scenes and has never felt the need to gain fame as a fashion designer. As she puts it, 'I never cared about having my name on the door—I’m a team player.' This philosophy guides her as she takes the first steps with 'Foryou' a diaper bag brand she founded alongside her good friend Noam Ravid, a fellow Shenkar graduate who also lives in New York. The brand's products are still under development. 'High fashion offers little stability,' she explains. 'You can have one hugely successful project and then go a year without work. That’s why I decided to launch a commercial brand—for financial stability and my kids’ future.' The brand will be infused with humor, something Shaked sees as a way to lighten the challenges of parenthood. 'It’s a reflection of everything I am—an entrepreneur, a mother, and a fashion designer. And finally, I’m the customer myself. Plus, I’ve found the best partner, who’s also a close friend. We’re building this together.' She describes the venture as her 'baby' and 'pension plan,' providing the security her family needs while allowing her to continue pursuing the extraordinary art she loves in the world of high fashion.

IDF strikes Beirut, 8 story building brought down	There was no warning from the IDF before the attack in the early morning hours as was customary; Hezbollah-affiliated media says the building struck by missiles and some nearby were full of people An eight story building was bombed by the IDF early on Saturday killing at least four people and wounding 23 others, according to Lebanese media reports. There was no warning from the IDF Arabic Language spokesperson, ahead of the attack on the Basta neighborhood, as had been the practice before strikes on the Dahieh district in the city or in South Lebanon. The blasts shook the capital around 4 a.m. (0200 GMT), Reuters witnesses said. Security sources said at least four bombs were dropped in the attack. It marked the fourth Israeli airstrike this week targeting a central area of Beirut, where the bulk of Israel's attacks have targeted the Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs. On Sunday an Israeli airstrike killed a Hezbollah media official in the Ras al-Nabaa district of central Beirut. The Hezbollah-affiliated Al Mayadeen network reported that the number of casualties was expected to rise because the building and others nearby were 'teaming with people,' and emergency teams were struggling to pull victims from the rubble.

My brush with justice: Serving on a New York jury	The jury summons in the mail felt like something out of a Law & Order episode, but reality proved exhausting and mundane; Daniel Edelson joined dozens of impatient candidates called to a courthouse in Lower Manhattan to participate in the US jury system; here's how it unfolded—right up to the anticlimactic ending For those raised on a steady diet of Judge Judy and reruns of Law & Order, few things are more unsettling than a letter in the mail that reads: 'You are summoned.' This meant I had been called to fulfill my civic duty as a juror. My mind raced with dramatic visions of jury room debates where I’d passionately argue, like Olivia Pope, to convince everyone that O.J. was guilty. Reality would hit me soon enough, but in the meantime, nothing was stopping me from Googling court dates for P. Diddy or scouring for new lawsuits against Donald Trump that might coincide with my summons. Who knows? Maybe I’d land on a high-profile case. The envelope in the mail couldn’t have been more conspicuous. Americans have always had a flair for the dramatic with bells and whistles. 'You Have Been Summoned for Jury Service,' the bold text declared. The date fell on the eve of a holiday, and for a brief moment, I considered invoking my Judaism to get out of it. But I knew it would only delay the inevitable. New York law allows you to postpone jury duty only once. Missing the rescheduled date would label me a 'non-compliant juror,' subject to a hefty fine or even arrest for contempt of court. And so, on a dark October morning, I found myself dragging out of bed before sunrise, stepping into the 48-degree chill, and navigating endless lines—from the subway entrance to the courthouse doors in Chinatown. Behind me stood a frazzled mom, who, in a distinctly un-New York, non-progressive Southern drawl, threatened to smack her crying baby if he didn’t stop. As would become a recurring theme, he probably didn’t want to be there any more than I did. Inside the courthouse, the same story continued: another line for the elevator, a never-ending line to the 11th floor, and yet another line outside the room where I was supposed to serve as a juror. The room was packed with dozens of people, most of whom looked tired, annoyed and not entirely sure why they were there. I joined the line without question—a distinctly American habit. After about 15 minutes, someone finally voiced the absurd question: 'Is this the line for jury duty?' It turned out I’d been standing in the wrong line entirely—this one was for exemptions, where people were trying to get out of serving. I’d thought people would jump at the chance to judge others. After all, we do it recreationally all the time—so why not earn $40 a day for it? But apparently, the idea doesn’t appeal to most. In a way, it was a relief to discover that beneath the saccharine American veneer lies a more honest truth: an individualistic, solidarity-free society doesn’t suddenly change its stripes over a fancy envelope in the mail. When presidential candidates openly call to dismantle already-weak public health care systems and deport the vulnerable and the foreign-born, is it any wonder that when told, 'Hey, without your presence, justice won’t be served,' they’re not exactly rushing to comply? Many Americans go to great lengths to avoid jury duty, sometimes in particularly creative ways. Some show up in expensive suits to appear 'too important' for the role, while others wear rags to convey the opposite impression. If they hear it’s a traffic case, they might suddenly declare, 'When I was five, my dad jaywalked, so I’m unfit to judge a case like this—sorry.' Those who remain face a barrage of manipulation from attorneys, who often assume the jurors lack knowledge and try to confuse them with complex calculations for medical damages. Jurors might whisper to one another, 'Oh, poor guy, maybe we should cut him some slack.' But typically, the judge steps in to steer the jury toward more reasonable conclusions, dropping heavy hints like, 'This person broke the law and should be punished accordingly.' For those unfamiliar with the system, it can seem odd. Would you trust your fate to the random person sitting next to you on the bus? Yet, Americans are deeply attached to their jury system (when they’re not required to participate). When told that in many countries a single judge decides cases, they tend to shift uncomfortably in their seats. What? Just one judge decides? Isn’t that strange? asdv The concept of a jury is admittedly quite noble. Its origins trace back to the Magna Carta—a 13th-century charter of rights that England’s King John was forced to sign, promising fair trials and ensuring that judges would not simply serve the interests of the ruling class. The United States, founded as a nation of immigrants seeking to escape Britain’s class system, naturally embraced this egalitarian principle. Juries are a cornerstone of the American justice system and are constitutionally mandated. Some might argue the process is merely theater, with judges ultimately steering decisions, but by law, juries hold the ultimate authority and can override a judge if they choose. The Constitution guarantees a fair and swift trial before a group of 'ordinary' citizens tasked with determining guilt or innocence. In criminal cases, jurors decide whether the prosecution has proven the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. For serious cases, such as those involving the death penalty, the jury also determines the sentence. In civil trials, jurors decide whether the defendant should compensate the plaintiff and, if so, how much. In states like New York, before criminal charges are filed, a 'grand jury' convenes to decide whether there is enough evidence to proceed to trial. Those following Trump’s legal entanglements may recall that if sufficient evidence is found, the case moves to a 'petit jury,' which determines guilt or innocence. In some cases, a separate jury may be assembled to decide the sentence. This layered process means one thing: the system needs a lot of jurors. Nearly every U.S. citizen over the age of 18 can be summoned for jury duty, entering a selection pool known as the 'jury pool.' To qualify, candidates must meet basic criteria, including citizenship, proficiency in English, good health and a clean criminal record. Selection happens through a process called 'voir dire,' where prospective jurors are questioned about their background and potential biases. Those chosen may spend days, weeks or even months serving, particularly in states where juries must reach unanimous decisions. For each day of jury service, participants are entitled to $40, paid either by the state or their employer. Interestingly, the British chose not to implement the jury system in what was then Mandatory Palestine. Fearing that local residents might acquit individuals charged with rebellion against the mandate, the British avoided introducing this extensive system. Today, it’s hard not to be struck by the enormous resources the U.S. dedicates to selecting jurors—a bureaucratic process turned into a large-scale operation. True to form, America does everything on a grand scale, even something as seemingly mundane as jury selection. asdfdxc A diverse crowd fills the spacious waiting room. Like New York City itself, the room is a microcosm of the world: old folk, blue-haired hipsters, suits and, above all, exhausted people nodding off in their chairs. Unlike other jurisdictions that rely solely on voter rolls, New York pulls potential jurors from a variety of databases—tax authorities, informal education records and more—aiming to reach as many people as possible and assemble the most diverse jury pool. Studies show that diverse juries have a significant advantage. Groups composed of individuals from varied backgrounds tend to examine evidence more thoroughly and engage in deeper discussions before reaching decisions. By contrast, homogeneous juries can lead to less fair verdicts, particularly in cases involving defendants from minority groups. All-white juries are statistically more likely to convict Black defendants at higher rates. I know this because it was explained to us by a law professor in a video shown to all jury candidates (more on that later). But despite the room’s visible diversity, everyone shares one common trait: no one wants to be there. I overheard one man solemnly argue to the clerk that being in a relationship made him unfit to serve. Another managed to dodge service by claiming he didn’t understand English—delivered in Spanish with a thick Yankee accent. Those of us who stayed filled out forms about ourselves and waited. And then we waited some more. 'Thank you for your service,' said the polite clerk, patiently repeating instructions for late arrivals with admirable composure. She played a video featuring the chief judge, who enthusiastically extolled the privilege of serving as a juror and ensuring justice for all. 'No one can escape this duty—not even me,' he concluded. Next came the professor’s video, with all the flair of a Hollywood production. It delved into biases and stereotypes. On-screen, dashed triangles formed a Star of David, triggering an odd sense of paranoia. The professor asked, 'How many triangles are in this image?' Answers ranged from 13 to one, but the correct answer was zero—none of the triangles were complete. The point was clear: we tend to fill in gaps and supply information that may not exist. She urged us to challenge assumptions and stereotypes ingrained by media. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Don’t let biases mislead you or discriminate based on religion, race or gender,' she said. 'The system relies on you to deliver justice without prejudice. Thank you for your service!' I left with a few good insights from these videos—ones that lasted about a day. The waiting continued until an unexpected reprieve: a lunch break. There’s no cafeteria in the courthouse, but being in the heart of Chinatown means dim sum beckons from every storefront. The $40 earned from this otherwise pointless day of waiting could easily be splurged. By 2:15 p.m., it was back to the jury room, where I claimed a desk with a charging port. The Wi-Fi was excellent, probably the highlight of the day. The supervisor asked us to maintain a 'library atmosphere,' which seemed fitting given the symphony of snoring around me. I settled into a few surprisingly productive hours of work. assfas Serving on a jury in New York was once a dubious experience, with dirty rooms, grumpy clerks more focused on cleaning floors and talk shows blaring on televisions. But in 1994, Chief Judge Judith Kaye, the state’s highest-ranking judicial official, decided enough was enough. 'We cannot ask jurors to fulfill their civic responsibility in a dilapidated environment while relying on outdated procedures,' she declared. Kaye shortened the duration of jury duty, renovated courthouses, emphasized better treatment of jurors by staff and introduced stricter oversight of the racial and ethnic composition of potential juries. In the past, attorneys could easily dismiss potential jurors based on gender, religion or other characteristics. As recently as May, widespread coverage emerged about a review of more than 35 death penalty convictions in California courts after revelations that prosecutors had manipulated jury selection. These prosecutors ensured Jewish jurors were excluded, citing surveys showing that, compared to other religious groups, Jews were less supportive of capital punishment. Jewish communities are among the most vocal opponents of execution by gas due to the Holocaust’s memory. Judges in the state admitted that excluding Jewish jurors from death penalty cases was a common practice. My grandfather, himself a Holocaust survivor, used to recount how he was disqualified from jury service in New York, even for minor cases, out of concern that the trauma of Auschwitz would make him biased. Even today, attorneys can exclude a certain number of individuals from jury duty if they believe, for any reason, that those individuals cannot be impartial. In a murder trial involving a shooting, for example, attorneys might ask potential jurors if they’ve lost a loved one under similar circumstances (think John Grisham’s The Runaway Jury, later adapted into a film starring Dustin Hoffman, John Cusack and Gene Hackman). In medical malpractice cases, they might ask if anyone has a doctor in their family, and so on. In my case, I didn’t even get the chance to be screened or excluded. At 5 p.m., the clerk cleared her throat and announced that all of us, without exception, were dismissed. The room burst to life, with cheers echoing from every corner. No one understood why we’d wasted an entire day waiting only to be sent home, but no one bothered to ask. I reclaimed my freedom and bid farewell to jury duty—at least for the next two years. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1vat5vzyx	2024-11-22T11:25:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/19/ryfNjJ11lke/ryfNjJ11lke_0_617_2250_1267_0_small.jpg

Minister Katz setting stage for settler assault on Palestinians, ...	Following Israel Katz's decision to cease using administrative detention orders against Jews in the West Bank, Palestinian Authority officials are saying this will lead to increased assaults by wayward settlers on Palestinian civilians; 'Then they will complain about The Hague,' says MK Tibi The Palestinian Authority is worried that Defense Minister Israel Katz's decision to cease using administrative detention orders against Jews in the West Bank might legitimize Jewish terror activities in the region, potentially leading to further escalation. Hours after Katz's announcement, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry stated that this decision 'will encourage settlers to commit additional crimes.' 'We view Defense Minister Katz's decision to cancel administrative detention against settlers committing crimes and violations against Palestinian civilians with great concern,' the statement read. The Palestinians also pointed out that 'the number of detainees is very small.' The Palestinian Authority warned that this decision by Katz, who recently assumed office replacing Yoav Gallant, 'encourages extreme settlers to engage in terrorism against Palestinians, their land, and property, giving them a sense of immunity and additional protection.' The Palestinian Foreign Ministry also called for 'effective international action' to curb what they described as 'settler militia terror.' According to the ministry, 'an end must be put to the fact that they receive 'immunity from punishment' and to protect our people from the occupation.' Qadura Fares, head of the Prisoners' Affairs Authority and former prisoners, also commented on Katz’s decision, stating that 'at a time when Israeli authorities are waging the most despicable war against the Palestinian people, with random arrests daily, and perpetuating collective punishment through an unprecedented expansion of administrative detention policy, about 3,500 Palestinians are detained today while the administrative detentions of the Jewish rioters are canceled.' He claimed this move reflects a 'racist and fascist state,' which he argues 'is based on hatred and organized crime, and in its extreme policy, threatens human and social values.' Legal officials issued a warning At noon, senior legal officials addressed the Defense Minister's decision, stating that 'the decision grants a 'license to kill' to 'Na'arei Gva'ot' (hilltop youth) and ties the hands of the Shin Bet in dealing with subversive Jewish elements in the territories.' They added that 'the decision could spur underground activities targeting Arabs and could ignite the area.' Senior officials clarified that 'the decision will also significantly harm the Shin Bet's ability to thwart and deter both extreme Jews and Arabs.' The legal system believes that if petitions are filed to the High Court of Justice, it will overturn Katz’s decision due to its discriminatory enforcement of law on racial grounds. Shin Bet declined to comment on the decision. This week, Defense Minister Katz informed Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar of the dramatic move and requested alternative tools be put in place. However, Katz did not cancel dozens of existing administrative detention orders, but he will not renew them when they expire in a few weeks. 'In a reality where settlements in the West Bank face severe Palestinian terror threats and unjustified international sanctions against settlers, it is not appropriate for the State of Israel to take such severe measures against the settlers,' stated the Defense Minister. Earlier, Knesset member Ahmad Tibi responded to the decision, saying, 'This is essentially the Defense Minister's certification for Jewish terrorism. Then they will complain about The Hague. A government of terror supporters.' The 'Tag Meir' organization, which fights hate crimes, stated: 'Administrative detention orders are aimed against Jewish terrorism and acts of revenge against innocent Palestinians. Ceasing the use of administrative detention orders will permit the bloodshed and property damage of these Palestinians, with the approval of the Defense Minister. Minister Katz ignores the diplomatic and security damage that will be caused to Israel due to this decision.' The 'Yesh Din' organization said: 'Administrative detentions are a draconian and anti-democratic measure that should cease to be used against both Palestinians and Israelis. Instead, law enforcement authorities should conduct effective investigations and prosecute when there is sufficient evidence. Let us remember that thousands of Palestinians are held in administrative detention under orders that Minister Katz did not cancel.'

The Kremlin said on Friday that a strike on Ukraine using a newly developed hypersonic ballistic missile was a message to the West that Moscow will respond harshly to any 'reckless' Western actions in support of Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was speaking a day after President Vladimir Putin said Moscow had fired the new missile - the Oreshnik or Hazel Tree - at a Ukrainian military facility in response to Kyiv striking Russia with U.S.-made and British-made missiles this week for the first time after the U.S. granted its approval.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1xejhcmjl	2024-11-22T08:28:47-08:00

Israel ponders giving aid distribution management in Gaza to US p...	Netanyahu wishes to have a private US security firm manage the issue of distributing humanitarian aid within Gaza, but runs into legal challenges regarding the scope of the operation, and the issue of footing the bill has not yet been solved, given it could implicate Israel in case it turns violent on the ground Amid the Israeli government's plan to delegate the responsibility of distributing humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip to an external company, two main issues are delaying the activation of the American security firm 'Orbis,' which is slated for this role. Legal challenges arise from the company's operational scope in Gaza and the financial source for covering its services. The anticipated cost for securing aid convoys is projected to be around $60 million, independent of the aid distribution itself, which is estimated at approximately $200 million. Additionally, establishing the company's distribution operations in Gaza is expected to take about three months—a problematic duration as most convoys currently entering the Strip are being plundered. Orbis is backed by former U.S. Army generals and is affiliated with an American parent company, essentially a conglomerate of six firms. It remains uncertain whether the U.S. will agree to finance the operation, given the financier assumes responsibility for aid distribution. Concerns were voiced in discussions about a scenario where Israel might be accused of a massacre if security personnel were compelled to open fire. Concurrently, it has been revealed that Israel has paid an advance to the American company to develop plans for a pilot project concerning aid distribution in Jabaliya, located in the northern Gaza Strip. The cabinet is expected to receive an update on the plan on Saturday, but it will not seek approval since a resolution has yet to be found for the challenges of assigning aid distribution to the external company Earlier, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant sharply criticized the government's intention to discuss 'food distribution to Gaza residents by private companies under IDF security,' labeling it a 'euphemism for the inception of military governance in Gaza.' Gallant argued that 'the price will be paid by the soldiers' blood and the State of Israel due to a flawed prioritization that will lead to the neglect of more critical security tasks. Everything hinges on the prior preparation of an alternative entity to replace the IDF in holding the territory—without this, we are on the path to martial law,' he stated. 'The aid will be distributed by private companies, the companies will be guarded by the IDF, and we will all bear the cost.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich responded to Gallant's remarks. 'for an entire year, he imagined a 'non-existent alternative' to do the work for us, effectively preventing us from taking responsibility for the distribution of humanitarian aid.' Smotrich claimed that 'since this non-existent entity did not materialize, Gallant allowed Hamas to seize control of humanitarian aid and maintain its rule in the Strip, thereby prolonging the conflict, increasing its cost, and exacerbating the suffering of hostages and their families. It is not the management of humanitarian aid that will lead to casualties, nor a military administration if required, but rather the fear of achieving total victory and territorial control that is essential for security.' National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir fiercely criticized Gallant as well. 'Tonight it was proven again how wise it was for the Prime Minister to dismiss the failed Defense Minister Gallant—as is well known, my position is clear that humanitarian aid should be exchanged only for humanitarian aid, but in any case—as long as aid continues—IDF control over the humanitarian aid to Gaza residents is crucial to dismantle Hamas and strip it of its remaining control of Gaza, which is the goal of the war. Gallant, who is deeply entrenched in the old paradigm and supported by the opposition, would be better off remaining there.' Adversely, former War Cabinet member Benny Gantz backed Gallant's statements, asserting that 'Israeli security control in Gaza is essential. Israeli governance when our soldiers are dealing with sewage and garbage is disastrous.'

Elise Stefanik assumes her position The United Nations faces serious challenges, according to Prof. Gerald Steinberg of NGO Monitor. In an interview with ILTV on Thursday, Steinberg predicted significant changes in the UN's approach once newly nominated U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Elise Stefanik, assumes her position under the Trump administration. 'The Trump administration could cut off a lot of funding for these activities, which I think will force a sobering up at the UN,' Steinberg said. 'I also believe that in other countries, there’s growing momentum to reevaluate their automatic support for international processes that are proving ineffective.' Steinberg also suggested that several Western European countries might recognize that current UN practices undermine their goals and interests, prompting them to advocate for change. His remarks followed the U.S. veto of a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The U.S. justified its veto, stating the resolution failed to include provisions for the immediate return of 101 Israeli hostages held by Hamas.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry0xxj0zye	2024-11-22T01:58:58-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2021/02/08/ByVVvvRxd/ByVVvvRxd_0_0_1020_574_0_small.jpg

Defense minister asks Shin Bet chief to plan an implement alternative measures to deal with settler violence in region; Smotrich and Ben-Gvir laud decision Defense Minister Israel Katz announced on Friday he decided to suspend the use of administrative detention orders against Jewish settlers in the West Bank. Katz informed Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar of the move earlier this week and requested the planning and implementation of alternative measures. 'In a reality where Jewish settlements in the West Bank face severe Palestinian terror threats and unjust international sanctions against settlers, it's inappropriate for the State of Israel to employ such severe measures against members of the settlement community,' Katz said, explaining his shift in policy. 'If suspicion of criminal acts arises, the perpetrators can be prosecuted. If not, there are other preventive measures that can be taken without resorting to administrative detention. I condemn any violence against Palestinians or acts of vigilante justice and call on settlement leadership to take a similar public stance and unequivocally denounce such actions,' he added.' 'It's essential to allow the IDF, other security agencies and law enforcement authorities to address Palestinian terror and violence without individuals taking the law into their own hands.' National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir praised the decision, saying, 'I commend my colleague, Minister Israel Katz, for this significant and important announcement. His decision to stop issuing administrative orders against settlers in the West Bank corrects years of injustice and honors those who love this land.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also lauded the decision: 'With this decision, Minister Katz has ended years of discrimination against West Bank settlers and rectified a long-standing injustice.' 'Settlers were treated as second-class citizens, subjected to draconian and undemocratic measures that trampled their rights — measures not applied to any other population in Israel except dangerous enemies and terrorists,' he added.

Biden slams ICC warrants as 'outrageous'	U.S. president criticizes UN court and asserts that there should be no equivalence between Israel and Hamas; Pentagon echoes condemnation U.S. President Joe Biden sharply criticized the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague following its decision to issue arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant. In a statement delivered late Thursday night, Biden said, 'The ICC issuance of arrest warrants against Israeli leaders is outrageous. Let me be clear once again: whatever the ICC might imply, there is no equivalence — none — between Israel and Hamas. We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security.' Biden's statement followed a response from the U.S. Pentagon on the warrants. Deputy Pentagon Spokesperson Sabrina Singh said on Thursday that the Pentagon rejected the ICC's decision and is concerned about the expedited manner in which the warrants were issued. According to her, senior Pentagon officials are currently consulting with their Israeli counterparts about the next steps. 'We're continuing to support Israel with the assistance it needs in its fight against Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah, we don't see eye-to-eye on where the ICC is and we reject the court's decision to issue these arrest warrants,' Singh noted. The ICC on Thursday announced that it had rejected appeals against the move submitted by Israel and issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, who was recently dismissed. The court also issued an arrest warrant for Mohammed Deif, despite reports of his elimination, as Hamas has not confirmed his death.

IAEA Board passes Iran resolution as West pushes Tehran toward ta...	UN atomic watchdog orders Tehran to improve cooperation with agency and provide it with 'comprehensive' report; Iran warns action against it could have the opposite effect The UN atomic watchdog's 35-nation Board of Governors passed a resolution on Thursday again ordering Iran to urgently improve cooperation with the agency and requesting a 'comprehensive' report aimed at pressuring Iran into fresh nuclear talks. The UK, France, Germany and the United States, which proposed the resolution, dismissed as insufficient and insincere a last-minute Iranian move to cap its stock of uranium that is close to weapons-grade. Diplomats said Iran's move was conditional on scrapping the resolution. Iran tends to bristle at such resolutions and has said it would respond in kind to this one. After previous criticism at the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board, it has stepped up its nuclear activities and reduced IAEA oversight. China, Russia and Burkina Faso voted against the text, diplomats in the meeting said. Nineteen countries voted in favor and 12 abstained. The IAEA and Iran have long been locked in standoffs on a range of issues including Tehran's failure to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites, its barring last year of most of the agency's top uranium-enrichment experts on the Iran inspection team, and its refusal to expand IAEA monitoring. The resolution seen by Reuters repeated wording from a November 2022 resolution that it was 'essential and urgent' for Iran to explain the uranium traces and let the IAEA take samples as necessary. The resolution in June of this year did the same. The new text asked the IAEA to issue 'a comprehensive and updated assessment on the possible presence or use of undeclared nuclear material in connection with past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran's nuclear program, including a full account of Iran's cooperation with the IAEA on these issues'. Western powers hope that report, due by spring 2025, will pressure Iran into negotiations on fresh restrictions on its nuclear activities, albeit less far-reaching ones than in a 2015 deal with major powers that unraveled after then-President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from it in 2018. With Trump due to return to office in January and Iran having taken its uranium enrichment far beyond the deal's limits, it is far from clear whether Trump would back negotiations aimed at setting new limits before the 2015 deal's ones are lifted on 'termination day' in October of next year. If no new limits are agreed before then, the report could be used to strengthen the case for so-called 'snapback', a process under the 2015 deal where the issue is sent to the U.N. Security Council and sanctions lifted under the deal can be re-imposed. Last week IAEA chief Rafael Grossi visited Tehran, hoping to convince new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is seen as relatively moderate, to improve Iran's cooperation with the agency. Iranian reaction Grossi formally reported to member states on Tuesday that 'the possibility of Iran not further expanding its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% U-235 was discussed' in his meetings with Iranian officials, and that the IAEA had verified Iran had 'begun implementation of preparatory measures'. Iran already has enough material enriched to that level, close to the roughly 90% purity that is weapons grade, for four nuclear weapons if enriched further, according to an IAEA yardstick. It has enough material enriched to lower levels for more bombs, but Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons. Grossi said on Wednesday he had asked Iran to cap that stock of 60% material and Iran had accepted his request. He told a news conference that day that it was 'a concrete step in the right direction', suggesting that he felt a resolution could undermine that progress.

Lebanon cease-fire could come 'within days', Israeli officials es...	Despite report claiming Lebanon has yet to agree to certain terms of the U.S.-led agreement, lawmakers say deal could be finalized by the weekend Lebanon seeks to modify the terms of the U.S.-proposed cease-fire agreement to ensure a 'speedier withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon and to give both parties the right to self-defense,' Reuters reported on Thursday amid U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein's visit to Israel directly from Beirut. According to a senior Lebanese official, the country’s negotiators requested these changes during meetings with Hochstein in Beirut. These amendments – previously unrequested by Lebanon – indicate that Hochstein still has significant hurdles to overcome to finalize the deal, despite his earlier statement in Beirut that an agreement was 'within reach.' The Lebanese official added that Lebanon wishes for Israeli forces to withdraw immediately after the cease-fire is declared, allowing the Lebanese Army to deploy across all areas and displaced persons to return to their homes. This position contradicts Israel’s stance, which envisioned a withdrawal within 60 days of the cease-fire taking effect. Lebanon also seeks a revision in the proposal to stress both sides' right to 'self-defense,' not just Israel's. The source noted that while the American draft refers to a withdrawal from 'Lebanese borders,' Beirut preferred specific wording referring to the 'Lebanese border' to ensure a complete Israeli withdrawal. Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said on Wednesday that Lebanon wants to enforce Hezbollah’s evacuation from southern Lebanon on its own terms, rather than via Israeli actions. Israel, for its part, demanded to prevent the terror organization from smuggling weapons into Lebanon by land, sea or air and insisted on guarantees that it can enforce this as a fundamental condition of any agreement. The Lebanese official noted that the U.S. draft makes no mention of Israel’s ability to continue striking Hezbollah and stressed that Lebanon insists on maintaining its sovereignty. Israel has also agreed to an addendum providing U.S. assurances that it can target Hezbollah in the future should the agreement be violated. Hochstein arrived in Israel on Wednesday after visiting Lebanon and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He also held talks with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a close confidant of the prime minister and then met with Defense Minister Israel Katz and IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi. Following these meetings, senior Israeli officials estimated that, despite the new conditions reported by Reuters, the agreement with Lebanon is likely to be finalized 'within days.' Meanwhile, official Lebanese sources told Sky News Arabia that 'the negotiations could lead to an agreement by the weekend, barring any obstacles.' However, estimates say the cease-fire announcement is unlikely to take this week and possibly not even next week.

IAEA Board passes Iran resolution as West pushes Tehran toward ta...	The U.N. atomic watchdog's 35-nation Board of Governors passed a resolution on Thursday again ordering Iran to urgently improve cooperation with the agency and requesting a 'comprehensive' report aimed at pressuring Iran into fresh nuclear talks. Britain, France, Germany and the United States, which proposed the resolution, dismissed as insufficient and insincere a last-minute Iranian move to cap its stock of uranium that is close to weapons-grade. Diplomats said Iran's move was conditional on scrapping the resolution. China, Russia and Burkina Faso voted against the text, diplomats in the meeting said. Nineteen countries voted in favor and 12 abstained. The resolution seen by Reuters repeated wording from a November 2022 resolution that it was 'essential and urgent' for Iran to explain the uranium traces found at undeclared sites and let the IAEA take samples as necessary. The resolution in June of this year did the same. Western powers hope the report, due by spring 2025, will pressure Iran into negotiations on fresh restrictions on its nuclear activities, albeit less far-reaching ones than in a 2015 deal with major powers that unravelled after then-President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from it in 2018.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjqegepgke	2024-11-21T13:14:02-08:00

State visit of Dutch foreign minister canceled as world reacts to...	Office of Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar says he spoke with Kasper Waldekamp and the two agreed his planned visit to the country should be postponed; Some countries support UN court's action while others say won't listen to warrants Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar canceled his Dutch counterpart Kasper Waldekamp’s visit to Israel set for Monday after the Netherlands, which hosts the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, became the first country to declare it would honor the court's arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant. Sa'ar spoke with Waldekamp, after which his office issued a statement. 'Minister Sa'ar expressed his disappointment, on behalf of the Israeli government and people, over the statement made in the Dutch Parliament following the ICC decision,' the statement said. 'The minister also presented Israel's stance regarding this scandalous and politically motivated decision. It was agreed during the conversation that the Dutch foreign minister's visit to Israel, planned for Monday, would not take place,' the statement added. Geert Wilders, the leader of the ruling coalition in the Netherlands and a vocal supporter of Israel, has yet to comment on the ICC decision. Meanwhile, Sa'ar engaged with his counterparts in two ICC member states – Argentina and Hungary – condemning the decision in strong terms. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto harshly criticized the warrant, calling it 'shameful and absurd.' 'This decision disgraces the international judiciary by equating leaders of a country attacked by a heinous terror attack with the leaders of the terrorist organization responsible,' he added. Argentine president Javier Milei also weighed in, saying his country 'declares its deep disagreement' with the ruling which 'ignores Israel's legitimate right to defend itself against ongoing attacks by terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah.' Another ICC member state, the UK, refused to commit to abide by the court’s ruling. 'This government has been clear that Israel has a right to defend itself, in accordance with international law. There is no moral equivalence between Israel, a democracy, and Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah, which are terrorist organizations,' a UK government spokesman said. Italy would have to arrest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he came to the country, Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said on Thursday. Meanwhile, the deputy speaker of the Czech parliament called on the parliament to consider a 'temporary suspension of Czech participation in the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute' and membership in the ICC, as well as re-evaluating the country's financial contributions to the court in The Hague. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded to questions about his view of the ICC decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. 'Everyone has to abide by international law,' Trudeau said. He added that Canada 'will abide by all the regulations and rulings of the international court.' Following the court’s decision, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar instructed Israeli ambassadors worldwide to 'engage influencers in general, not just those in power, foreign ministries or the prime minister's office. In some countries, it might be the opposition that could strongly voice opposition to this. And we need that. We need those voices to be heard.' 'A modern Dreyfus trial' Meanwhile, Netanyahu's office commented on the UN top court's decision. 'The antisemitic decision of the International Criminal Court is a modern Dreyfus trial – and will end the same way. Israel utterly rejects the false and absurd charges of the International Criminal Court, a biased and discriminatory political body,' the PMO said in a statement. 'No war is more just than the war Israel has been waging in Gaza since October 7, 2023, when the Hamas terrorist organization launched a murderous assault and perpetrated the largest massacre against the Jewish People since the Holocaust,' it added. 'The decision to issue an arrest warrant against the Prime Minister was made by a corrupt chief prosecutor who is trying to save himself from sexual harassment accusations and biased judges who are motivated by antisemitic hatred of Israel. 'The ICC prosecutor lied when he told American senators that he would take no action until he had visited Israel and heard its side. Instead, he cancelled his arrival in Israel last May, several days after suspicions of sexual harassment were made against him, and announced his intention to issue arrest warrants against the Prime Minister and former Defense Minister.' 'No anti-Israel decision will prevent the State of Israel from defending its citizens. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not give in to pressure. He will continue to pursue all the objectives that Israel set out to achieve in its just war against Hamas and the Iranian axis of terror,' the statement concluded.

'The use of a ballistic missile against Ukraine today is yet more proof that Russia has no interest in peace.'

First sergeant Ron Epshtein is 29th soldier killed in current rai...	Soldier, 19, , was killed by an artillery shell in the northern Gaza Strip, though it is not clear whether it was fired by Hamas or the IDF; The raid in Jabaliya, the 3rd since the war started, began last month and hundreds of terrorists have been killed or arrested First sergeant Ron Epshtein, 19, from Nesher, a soldier in the Tzabar Battalion, Givati Brigade, was killed Thursday by an artillery shell in Jabaliya, becoming the 29th IDF casualty since the raid began in the northern Gaza Strip last month. It is not clear whether the shell was fired by Hamas or the IDF. Epshtein, the son of Dimitri and Olga and brother to Daniel, Dina and Maya, was a student at the Hebrew Reali School of Haifa. He is the 14th fallen soldier from the Reali School since the beginning of the war. The director of the school, Yossi Ben David, said announced Epshtein's death in GAza and noted that his sister Maya is in 12th grade at the school and that his older siblings also were graduates of the school. The municipality paid tribute to its native son. 'The city of Nesher bows its head upon receiving the news of the death of Sergeant Ron Epshtein, a native of the city, a soldier in the Tzabar Battalion (432) from the Givati ​​Brigade, who fell in battle in the northern Gaza Strip. In this unbearably difficult time, we want to hug the Epshtein family, parents Dimitri and Olga and his siblings Daniel, Dina and Maya. May God grant that you will know no more sorrow. May his memory be blessed and engraved forever in our hearts.' On Wednesday the IDF announced that Sergeant First Class (res.) Roi Sasson, 21, from Mevaseret Zion, a soldier in the Nachshon Battalion of the Kfir Brigade, fell Tuesday in an encounter with terrorists in Jabaliya. In the same incident, the commander of the Nachshon Battalion, Kfir Brigade, Lt. Col. Yoel Glickman, was seriously injured, though his life is not in danger. A preliminary investigation of the encounter reveals that the force under Glickman's command was ambushed by a terrorist squad that was waiting inside a building, and came at the end of the battalion's attack on a target in the seam between Beit Lahia and Jabaliya. On Sunday, the Nachshon Battalion had two more soldiers who fell in battle in Jabaliya, who fell in the battle in Jabaliya, Captain Yogev Pazy and Staff Sergeant Noam Eitan. A day before, Sergeant First Class (res.) Idan Kenan Cohen from the battalion also fell in battle. The raid on Jabaliya began about a month and a half ago, although the IDF had already raided the city twice before in the past year - first during an operation in December, and in May and June of this year. Among the 29 dead are also quite a few officers, including the commander of the Israel Defense Force's 401st Armored Brigade, Col. Ehsan Daqsa. In this raid, the forces are scanning Hamas headquarters, mainly in the city's refugee camp, and are also putting pressure on the two neighboring towns, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia, in order to move the remaining population south toward Gaza City, and then to continue even further south, beyond the Netzarim Corridor and the southern Gaza Strip. IDF forces are discovering weapons caches daily and engaging with terrorists regularly. The primary threat remains IEDs: Hamas has rigged more than 200 buildings in Jabaliya, primarily with 'dumb' explosives using improvised tripwires but without surveillance cameras. The IDF estimates this operation will be more prolonged than previous ones, potentially lasting several more weeks. Three IDF brigades under the 162nd Division are participating in the raid. The IDF has identified Jabaliya as a core Hamas stronghold in northern Gaza, where hundreds of terrorists — including senior commanders — have converged. Despite the IDF managing to evacuate tens of thousands of residents from the city over the past month, breaking what the IDF describes as a 'fear barrier' imposed by Hamas, a few thousand civilians remain.

Can't determine Deif has been killed': ICC's charges against for...	UN's top court issues arrest warrant against presumed killed Hamas military leader Mohammad Deif alongside Netanyahu and Gallant The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague issued an arrest warrant for the former head of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, who was reportedly killed last July in an IDF strike in Khan Younis. In the same decision, the court also issued warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Deif was charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes months after the IDF announced Deif's assassination. According to the ICC, the reason behind the warrant is the inability to determine whether Deif was killed. The serious charges against him include 'crimes against humanity of murder; extermination; torture; and rape and other form of sexual violence; as well as the war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, torture, taking hostages; outrages upon personal dignity; and rape and other form of sexual violence.' The ICC's announcement said the alleged crimes attributed to Deif took place 'on the territory of the State of Israel and the State of Palestine from at least 7 October 2023.' It was also noted the prosecution initially filed requests for arrest warrants against two other Hamas leaders, Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar, who have since been killed. 'Following confirmation of their deaths, the Chamber granted the withdrawal of the applications on 9 August 2024 and 25 October 2024, respectively. With respect to Mr. Deif, the Prosecution indicated that it would continue to gather information with respect to his reported death,' the statement read. 'On 15 November 2024, the Prosecution, referring to information from both the Israeli and Palestinian authorities, notified the Chamber that it is not in a position to determine whether Mr Deif has been killed or remains alive. Therefore, the Chamber issues the present warrant of arrest,' it added. 'The warrant of arrest for Mr. Deif is classified as ‘secret’ in order to protect witnesses and to safeguard the conduct of investigations. However, the Chamber decided to release the information below since conduct similar to that addressed in the warrant of arrest appears to be ongoing, in particular the holding of a number of hostages captive. The Chamber considers it is also in the interest of victims and their families to be aware of the warrant’s existence,' the ICC stressed. 'The Chamber found reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Deif, born in 1965, the highest commander of the military wing of Hamas (known as the al-Qassam Brigades) at the time of the alleged conduct, is responsible for the crimes against humanity of murder; extermination; torture; and rape and other form of sexual violence; as well as the war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, torture, taking hostages; outrages upon personal dignity; and rape and other form of sexual violence.' 'The Chamber found reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Deif bears criminal responsibility for the aforementioned crimes for having committed the acts jointly and through others and having ordered or induced the commission of the crimes, and for his failure to exercise proper control over forces under his effective command and control,' it added. 'The Chamber found reasonable grounds to believe that during the relevant time, international humanitarian law related to international armed conflict (between Israel and Palestine) and non-international armed conflict (between Israel and Hamas) applied. The Chamber also found that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the crimes against humanity were part of a widespread and systematic attack directed by Hamas and other armed groups against the civilian population of Israel.'

Sending a message to Assad: New details behind the unusual attack...	At least 82 Hezbollah terrorists and militia leaders were killed while the Syrian president was hosting them, and the timing at the height of cease-fire negotiations is no coincidence; 'Israeli attacks in Syria have increased significantly, both in frequency and scope' Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition organization based in London, reported Thursday evening that at least 82 terrorists and commanders in the pro-Iranian militias and the Lebanese Hezbollah organization were killed in the unusual attack in Syria attributed to Israel in Tadmor. According to the group, 56 of the dead are Syrians affiliated with the pro-Iranian militias, and 22 are of non-Syrian nationality, most of them from the pro-Iranian Iraqi al-Nujaba militia. Next to them, four Hezbollah members also were killed. If the reports are correct, it appears that this is a message to Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is hosting senior members of Hezbollah, and therefore Israel is increasing the pressure on the terrorist organization, precisely at the height of negotiations toward a cease-fire, and maximizing success in hitting it not only in Lebanon. Najat Rochdi, the UN's special deputy envoy for Syria, expressed concern about the escalation in the region, telling the UN Security Council that 'the Israeli attacks are probably the deadliest that have hit Syria so far.' According to her, 'Israeli attacks in Syria have increased significantly, both in frequency and scope.' She pointed out that Israel says its attacks are aimed at targets related to Iran, Hezbollah or the Islamic Jihad, but in practice 'there are civilian casualties, including in large attacks on residential areas in the heart of Damascus' that took place recently. She also expressed concern about the 'volatile situation' in the Golan Heights and northwestern Syria, and clarified that 'this year is on track to be the most violent in Syria since 2020, and the risk of even greater destruction is still on the horizon.' After Wednesday's attack, which targeted the city of Tadmor in the Syrian desert, the Ministry of Defense in Syria claimed that Israel attacked from the air from the area of ​​the American military base at Tanaf, which is located in the Syria-Jordan-Iraq border triangle. The ministry has so far reported only 36 deaths, in contrast to the number stated by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and also significant material damage to the buildings that came under attack and their surroundings. In the report, the Syrian Observatory stated that the attack was aimed at three separate sites in the city of Tadmor, two of them in the Al-Jamaiya neighborhood; One of the sites is a weapons depot near an industrial area. The area reportedly is home to families of pro-Iranian activists who have Iraqi citizenship. And in the third site that was attacked, according to the Syrian Observatory, there was a meeting of leaders from the pro-Iranian militias who are in Tadmor, including senior officials from the pro-Iranian Iraqi al-Nujaba militia and a leader from Hezbollah. Meanwhile, an IDF force arrested a Syrian suspect on Thursday who breached the border fence into the southern Golan Heights. The suspect did not stop when ordered to by the soldiers, who shot him in the leg. He was then transferred to Ziv Hospital in Safed for further treatment and investigation, according to the IDF. The Syrian radio station 'Sham FM' commented on the incident, and claimed that the IDF 'kidnapped a 63-year-old civilian who was herding cattle in the area between Syria and Israel, which is under the control of the United Nations, west of the village of A-Rapid in the southern countryside of Quneitra.'

Biden, Trump officials reject ICC warrants against Netanyahu and ...	U.S. lawmakers condemn UN Court's decision to issue the warrants saying the current and next administrations won't abide by them; 'Expect a strong response in January,' Trump official says The White House on Thursday condemned the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) issuing of arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, saying that it 'fundamentally rejects the Court’s decision.' U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby added that: 'We remain deeply concerned by the prosecutor’s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision.' He said the U.S. will discuss its next steps with its partners. Earlier, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s chosen national security advisor Michael Waltz criticized the ICC, saying that it lacked credibility. 'These allegations have been refuted by the U.S. government,' he added. Waltz, whom Trump intends to appoint as his advisor upon taking office, added that 'Israel has lawfully defended its people and borders from genocidal terrorists. You can expect a strong response to the antisemitic bias of the ICC & UN come January.' Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, representing South Carolina, also condemned the ICC’s decision, saying that the ' International Corrupt Criminal Court has acted in the most absurd and irresponsible manner possible by issuing arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant while there's a serious cloud of allegations hanging out over the prosecutor who sought these warrants.' 'If we do not act forcefully against the ICC after their outrageous decision to issue arrest warrants for the duly elected Israeli Prime Minister and former Minister of Defense, we are making a huge mistake, and I fear the United States is next,' he added. The immediate implication of the warrants means that Netanyahu and Gallant are effectively confined to Israel – they can't travel abroad, especially not to any of the 124 ICC member states, which include most European, African and South American countries. While Netanyahu and Gallant could potentially visit these nations, it would require convincing them not to enforce the warrants. In practice, this means Netanyahu is becoming an 'ostracized' leader. However, the U.S. isn't a member of the ICC and hasn't signed the Rome Statute that governs it, so Netanyahu wouldn't face travel issues there. Nevertheless, logistical challenges could arise regarding flight routes, as some countries might bar Israel’s state aircraft from passage through their airspace. Graham also called for an independent investigation into the prosecutor's misconduct, saying that issuing a warrant based on such work undermines any sense of fairness and the rule of law.

Czech lawmaker says ICC decision legalizes antisemitism on a glob...	Jan Bartošek condemned the ICC decision to issue arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. 'Today, at a time when the world public is alarmed by the rise of antisemitism, when world politicians are condemning its violent manifestations, as in the recent attack on Jews in the streets of Amsterdam, we are witnessing an absolutely unprecedented decision that de facto legalizes antisemitism on a global level,' he posted on social media. 'Moreover, the decision of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Galant is an unprecedented legal act, as it concerns the democratically elected prime minister of a sovereign country. The ICC has thus contributed to the overall atmosphere of uncertainty in the current world order. It equates terrorists with legally elected state leaders, which in practical terms can only embolden terrorist movements around the world.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bktqikazjx	2024-11-21T08:20:42-08:00	
President of Argentina says ICC 'ignoring Israel's right to defen...	Argentine President Javier Millay responded to the decision of the International Criminal Court in The Hague (ICC) to issue arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Argentina 'expresses its profound disagreement with the recent decision of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to issue arrest warrants against the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the former Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant. This resolution ignores Israel's legitimate right to defend itself against constant attacks by terrorist organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah. Israel faces brutal aggression, inhumane hostage-taking, and the indiscriminate launching of attacks against its population. Criminalizing the legitimate defense of a nation while ignoring these atrocities is an act that distorts the spirit of international justice. Argentina stands in solidarity with Israel, reaffirms its right to protect its people, and demands the immediate release of all hostages.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byvu9ypzjg	2024-11-21T08:16:46-08:00

Lone soldiers reflect on reason for making aliyah, join war effor...	Sergeant First Class Eli Zivan was in Mexico when the war broke out, and just 2 days later he was in the Gaza border area; Sergeant Major Yoni Heilman joined the IDF in 2002 as a lone soldier and afterward lived in both countries, but the war made it clear to him Israel was a core part of his identity Sergeant First Class Eli Zivan and Sergeant Major Yoni Heilman have always felt a deep connection to Israel, which inspired them to serve as lone soldiers in the IDF. When war broke out on October 7, they immediately took action to join the fight, reaffirming for them that Israel was their home. Yoni, tell us a little about yourself, and how you made aliyah to Israel the first time. 'I grew up back and forth between Israel and America,' Heilman began. 'I first served in Nahal as a volunteer through the Mahal program, and I made aliyah with my wife in 2009 when we were expecting our first child. We returned to the United States for a time but made aliyah again a few years ago.' Heilman’s connection to Israel has always been strong. His initial service as a lone soldier reflected his commitment to making Israel his home. And I understand that you made aliyah as a lone soldier. What was your motivation? 'I always knew I would spend my life in Israel, but I wasn’t quite ready to make aliyah at 18. Still, I wanted to serve in the army and be ready to answer the call when needed,' Heilman explained. In 2002, shortly after Operation Defensive Shield, Heilman came to Israel as a lone soldier in the Nahal Brigade. 'I grew up in a Zionist household where Israel was a core part of my identity. For me, serving was about earning my place in this country,' he said. Eli, for you, it was a bit different because you made aliyah with your family. How was it for you? Zivan shared that he is the youngest of five brothers, all of whom served in combat units during the war. 'We were raised in a Zionist home with the understanding that Israel is our land, and this is where we live our lives,' he said. 'Every day during this war, I felt like I was fulfilling the Zionist dream I grew up with. I was doing exactly what my upbringing prepared me for,' Zivan added. Where did October 7 catch you? Zivan recalled being in Mexico on the Pacific coast between school semesters when news of the terror attacks broke. 'I saw what was happening on my phone and immediately started making calls. The Mexican consulate helped me secure a flight, and by October 9 I was back with my team,' he said. Soon after his return, Zivan and his unit were clearing the area around the Nova music festival and nearby kibbutzim, preparing for the next steps in the military operation. Heilman, already in Israel on October 7, was at home in Modi’in with his family. 'I was about to leave for an errand when I got the call. By 9:30 a.m. or 10 a.m., I was at our base, gathering gear. Thirty-six hours later, we were in the south, working in the same areas Eli mentioned, including the Nova festival and several kibbutzim,' he said. I understand that you decided to document your experience in a WhatsApp group. You have many followers. 'Yes,' Heilman confirmed. 'It started as updates to my wife, then my family. Eventually, it grew to include hundreds of people.' For Heilman, writing became a form of processing the intense experiences of war. 'Every day, I’d put my thoughts down as a way to clear my mind enough to sleep for a few hours. It wasn’t my intention to attract so many readers, but people wanted to feel connected to what was happening on the front lines,' he said. What do you share? 'Mostly, I share my feelings,' Heilman explained. 'I can’t always describe what I’ve seen or experienced, but I try to convey the emotional reality. In the first month, our unit focused on securing areas and performing the tragic but sacred duty of collecting our fallen brothers and sisters.' He also highlighted the inspiration he drew from his fellow soldiers. 'The heartbreak was immense, but the commitment of so many soldiers showing up, ready to do whatever was needed to make this country safer, was profoundly moving,' he said. A message you wish to convey, both of you. Zivan began, 'My greatest wish is for the safe return of all 101 hostages and for everyone serving to come home safely. I hope we complete this mission at the highest level, so our friends and brothers who fell for this country will not have done so in vain.' Heilman echoed these sentiments. 'There’s been a lot of discussion about the heavy burden on the nation, and while we are tired, it’s an honor to be part of this effort. We are not ready to go home until everyone is brought back, and we’ve made this country safe again.'

Is it safe to be Jewish in Spain?	Student Erica Mahler says Jewish, Israeli friends have faced 'aggression' A young Jewish woman has shared her fears about openly expressing her Jewish identity in Spain as antisemitism continues to rise in the country. Speaking to ILTV News, Erica Mahler, a student at the University of Barcelona, said, 'There have been a lot of incidents with my friends where they have shown they are Jewish or Israeli, and they have been faced with aggression.' She mentioned a recent incident in her neighborhood where a mezuzah was ripped off someone’s door. 'So, there is sort of a fear of showing openly that you're Israeli or Jewish, but at the same time, it's not stopping us from moving forward and trying to educate the people so that we can live openly within our society,' Mahler added. Watch the full interview: Spain has experienced one of the largest spikes in antisemitism since the war. According to a recent report by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 78% of Spanish Jews consider antisemitism to be a very big or fairly big problem in the country. Additionally, Spain is one of three countries, alongside Ireland and Norway, to formally recognize a unified Palestinian state under the Palestinian Authority. This recognition comes despite Israel’s parliament ruling that it will not recognize or allow such a state at this time.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sknnrtnmyg	2024-11-21T05:42:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/21/ryDiL63GJg/ryDiL63GJg_137_1_805_453_0_small.jpg
Ex-Israeli turns Menendez brothers' mansion into a home that host...	For years – until it was sold for $17 million shortly before the release of the series 'Monsters,' which spotlighted the infamous murder in the lavish Beverly Hills mansion – Sam Delug lived in the villa and hosted approximately 75 fundraising events in support of Israel For years, the stunning mansion on Elm Drive in Beverly Hills has been a magnet for curious onlookers and tourist buses eager to catch a glimpse of celebrity homes. Recently, interest in the property surged, thanks to Netflix’s 'Monsters' series chronicling the story of Lyle and Erik Menendez. The mansion’s dark history as the scene of one of the world’s most infamous murders has long fascinated the public. It turns out the home has a connection to a former Israeli, Sam Delug. Until a few months ago, Delug owned the property and, while he found the endless curiosity puzzling, it didn’t bother him much after the first few years. 'When I first moved in, people wouldn’t just stare from a distance – they’d knock on the door and ask to come inside as if it were a museum,' Delug recalls. 'I’d tell them, ‘If you don’t leave my property, I’ll call the police.’ But that only lasted two or three years, and then it stopped.' Delug, a warm-hearted entrepreneur, lawyer, and philanthropist, was born in Melbourne, Australia. He moved to Israel with his family at age seven and lived there for three years before relocating to New York and eventually settling in Los Angeles. The tragedy that shocked Beverly Hills and the U.S. The murders of Jose and Mary Louise 'Kitty' Menendez horrified the elite neighborhood of Beverly Hills –and the entire nation. On August 20, 1989, the couple was relaxing in the living room of their mansion, watching television, when their sons entered and fatally shot them. Jose was struck six times, and Kitty was shot 10 times. Later that night, the brothers called the police, claiming they had found their parents dead. Initially, suspicion turned toward external threats, including the local mafia. But the brothers drew attention when they began spending millions of dollars from their inheritance soon after the murders. Investigators eventually tied them to the crime when Erik confessed to his psychologist, who alerted the authorities. During their high-profile trial, the Menendez brothers claimed they had suffered years of sexual abuse at the hands of their father, which drove them to commit the murders. Despite their defense, they were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. From infamous crime scene to renovated haven The mansion changed hands for the first time in 1991 and was sold two years later to William Link, co-creator of the TV series 'Murder, She Wrote.' In 2001, Sam Delug purchased the home for $3.7 million. Before buying, Delug visited the house with his three children, then young adults, to gauge their feelings. 'I wanted to make sure they felt comfortable,' he says. 'My youngest was 19 at the time, and none of them lived with me anymore, but I still wanted each of them to have a room to call their own when they visited. They told me, ‘Dad, it’s just another house. We’re fine with it.’' Built in 1927, the house was dated by the time Delug moved in, so he hired an interior designer to renovate the entire property. The exterior, however, was left untouched, maintaining the structure’s historic charm. The infamous living room where the murders occurred was transformed into a bright, welcoming TV room with doors leading to the garden. 'Most people wouldn’t believe such a tragedy took place in that space,' Delug says. 'It’s now light, inviting and peaceful.' After the renovation, Delug began hosting charity events at the mansion, primarily for Jewish and pro-Israel organizations. Groups like Stand With Us, AIPAC, and the Maccabiah Games regularly benefitted from his gatherings. The mansion also became a venue for other causes, such as fundraisers for Beit Halochem and Israel Bonds. 'I’m 100% a Zionist,' Delug says proudly. A legacy of community and philanthropy Over the years, Delug’s home became a hub for philanthropy. Notable speakers, such as Yoseph Haddad, an activist for Israel’s image abroad, and Micky Kubi, a former senior Shin Bet investigator, have shared their stories at events there. 'I started getting involved in the community 20 years ago, and for the past 15 years I’ve hosted four to five major events a year,' Delug says. 'Altogether, I’ve probably hosted about 75 events, including a break-fast meal after Yom Kippur. Anyone without a place to go is welcome. That’s my first mitzvah of the year.' Delug visits Israel twice a year and has a deep connection to the country. After arriving for a visit shortly before October 7, 2023, he found himself stranded in Israel due to the outbreak of war. 'I was supposed to leave on October 11 and meet my son in Italy, but I couldn’t go,' he recalls. Earlier in the year, he returned to Israel with a Stand With Us delegation, organizing a barbecue for soldiers and bringing musicians to perform for them. 'They appreciated it so much,' he says. Saying goodbye to Elm Drive After 22 years in the Elm Drive mansion, Delug decided it was time to move on. 'To be honest, I was tired of people referring to it as ‘the Menendez house.’ Nobody could just say I lived in Los Angeles. Well, now they can’t say that anymore,' he says, half-jokingly. During his time there, Delug says he never felt any negative energy in the home. On the contrary, it became a vibrant space filled with joy and purpose. Still, leaving wasn’t easy. 'This house holds some of the best memories of my life,' he admits. 'But I believe in creating new memories.' The seven-bedroom, nine-bathroom estate sold earlier this year for approximately $17 million, closing a chapter in its long and storied history.

Travel to and from Israel remains difficult, but relief may be on...	Arkia and Israir have received government approval to begin operating flights to the United States in the coming weeks Since the start of the ongoing war, numerous airlines have suspended flights to and from Israel, making travel both challenging and extremely expensive. Now, two Israeli airlines have made an announcement that could ease the burden. Air travel in and out of Israel has faced significant challenges. Due to the war and escalating tensions in the north, major carriers like Lufthansa, Air France, Virgin Atlantic, and United Airlines have suspended flights to Tel Aviv, leaving Israeli airline El Al as the sole operator connecting Israel to the United States. This lack of competition has caused flight prices to soar, making air travel an unaffordable luxury for many. But there’s hope on the horizon. Arkia and Israir have received government approval to begin operating flights to the United States in the coming weeks. Both airlines plan to lease aircraft from Europe and operate ten weekly flights with foreign crews. Their entry into the U.S. market is expected to increase competition and potentially lower fares for travelers. Meanwhile, the list of suspended flights continues to grow. Airlines such as Air France, British Airways, and American Airlines have announced delays in resuming service to Israel, with some pushing return dates as far back as late 2025 due to operational challenges and security concerns.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h15syangyl	2024-11-21T05:14:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/16/rJcDGtXET/rJcDGtXET_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Ex-justice minister Ayelet Shaked claims Australia denied entry v...	Shaked slams Australian government as 'anti-Israeli' and 'antisemitic,' adding that 'These are dark days for Australian democracy' as Canberra chose 'the wrong side of history' Former justice minister Ayelet Shaked said Thursday that Australia refused to grant her a visa to enter the country, a move she attributed to political motives, namely due to her opposition to Palestinian statehood. 'The current Australian government is anti-Israeli, extremely pro-Palestinian and in some parts even antisemitic,' Shaked said. 'Because of my opposition to a Palestinian state, they won’t allow me to visit and engage in strategic dialogue between our countries. These are dark days for Australian democracy, and this government has chosen the wrong side of history.' According to Shaked, she traveled to 'participate in a strategic dialogue between the countries at the AIJAC conference.' She said the decision by the Labor government was 'a clear testament to its hypocrisy and its hostile stance toward Israel.' Like many countries around the world, the war in Gaza, which began following the October 7 massacre, has sparked heated political debates in Australia. While the left-wing Labor government has repeatedly called for a cease-fire, it has, unlike countries such as Spain, Ireland and Norway—who have been more critical of Israel—avoided recognizing a Palestinian state. Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization in Australia. Throughout the summer, Australia’s political system was embroiled in debates over whether to allow Palestinian refugees to remain in the country or continue to arrive due to the ongoing war in Gaza. Canberra announced plans to extend the temporary visas of refugees who had already arrived, while the conservative opposition leader called for an outright ban on the arrival of Gazans, fearing that some might pose a security risk. According to Australian broadcaster ABC, by August, the government had granted nearly 3,000 'visitor' visas to Palestinians who had fled Gaza or the West Bank after October 7. However, only about half of them had actually arrived in Australia, and another 7,000 applications were rejected. The visas granted were temporary, and due to the ongoing war, their validity is set to expire soon. The Australian government has stated it is exploring ways to extend the stay of the Palestinian refugees.

TESTING	TESTING A Melburne woman who disappeared last month was allegedly murdered by her 'sugar daddy,' whose friend, an Israeli man, is accused of helping him dispose of her body, according to police documents released by the Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Wednesday evening. The remains, believed to belong to 19-year-old Isla Bell, were found in a trash site Tuesday morning, though formal identification is pending. According to the indictment, Marat Ganiev, 53, is accused of killing Bell just after midnight on October 7, days before her 20th birthday, while his friend, Eyal Yaffe, 57, allegedly assisted in covering up the crime. Australian media reported that Bell was last seen leaving her Brunswick home on October 4. In a message sent to a friend shortly before her death, Bell described Ganiev as 'the best Russian sugar daddy' who was lavishing her with gifts and had saved her from 'sex traffickers.' Authorities believe Bell was killed in Ganiev’s apartment kitchen. Surveillance footage reportedly showed her entering his residence on October 5, with no evidence of her leaving. Police allege that Ganiev, a reported heroin addict, and Yaffe placed Bell’s body in a fridge, which was moved to other locations around Melbourne. On November 18, a man discovered the fridge on the street and, after unwrapping it, discarded a bag from inside, thinking it contained animal remains. He left the fridge on the street of a Melbourne suburb, where police found it the next day. Bell’s remains were later identified at a landfill in Dandenong, another Melbourne suburb. Ganiev faces charges of murder. Yaffe, who police say planned to flee to Bulgaria, has been charged with being an accessory after the fact. In court, Yaffe reportedly admitted to disposing of Bell’s body but denied involvement in the killing. He was seen smiling and interacting with guards and family members during his court appearance. Bell’s mother, Justine Spokes, paid tribute to her daughter on the day her body was found. 'Cherished forever and suffering no more,' she said. 'I am so sorry I could not protect you, that your experience of the world was cruel and unsafe. Despite your challenges, you lived bravely, stood up for what was right and remained the kindest human, the gentlest soul… With the deepest love and respect, your Mumma.'

Melbourne woman allegedly murdered by her 'sugar daddy,' while his friend, Eyal Yaffe, accused of helping dispose of her body, police say; victim’s remains, believed to be those of 19-year-old Isla Bell, discovered at local landfill A Melbourne woman who disappeared last month was allegedly murdered by her 'sugar daddy,' whose friend, an Israeli man, is accused of helping him dispose of her body, according to police documents released by the Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Wednesday evening. The remains, believed to belong to 19-year-old Isla Bell, were found in a trash site Tuesday morning, though formal identification is pending. According to the indictment, Marat Ganiev, 53, is accused of killing Bell just after midnight on October 7, days before her 20th birthday, while his friend, Eyal Yaffe, 57, allegedly assisted in covering up the crime. Australian media reported that Bell was last seen leaving her Brunswick home on October 4.

Jews from across North America share stories of renewal, resilien...	Eshkol Mayor Michal Uziyahu at the event: 'Our story did not start on October 7 and for sure it did not end that day either' More than 2,500 people came together last week in Dallas for the Jewish National Fund’s annual conference, titled 'We Choose Life: Rebuilding and Reimagining Israel's North and South.' The conference focused on the land and people of Israel, emphasizing a message that transcends politics—it's not about Right or Left, red or blue, but about building a brighter future for the Jewish state. 'It’s amazing to know there are this many people who have come together with a common goal of securing Israel, dealing with obviously the issues of antisemitism and education,' said Deb Lust Zaluda, president of JNF-USA. 'These are all people that share the same values as I have.' Among the speakers were prominent Israeli leaders, including Michal Uziyahu, Mayor of Eshkol—a region ravaged by Hamas attacks—and Nisan Zeevi, Commander of the Emergency Squad in Kfar Giladi, a community under threat from Hezbollah. Both shared inspiring messages of hope and resilience. Currently, around 65,000 Israelis remain displaced from their homes in the North. This region, where JNF-USA has invested heavily for decades, has faced relentless Hezbollah rocket fire since October 8. In response, JNF-USA has not only provided critical funding but also partnered with local communities to reimagine and rebuild a brighter future. 'Our story did not start on October 7 and for sure it did not end that day either,' said Eshkol Mayor Michal Uziyahu. 'Our story is a story of light, of life and of hope.' 'Together we can - we will - make the Galilee great again,' added Nisan Zeevi, commander of the Kfar Giladi Emergency Squad. The conference also highlighted inspiring stories from students of JNF’s Alexander Muss High School in Israel. They shared how their time at the school deepened their understanding of Judaism and strengthened their connection to the land and people of Israel. In a time of rising antisemitism worldwide, including in the United States, these young leaders expressed pride in their Jewish identity and a renewed commitment to their heritage. 'Hasbara is more important now than ever. Everyone needs to use their voice. Every person who can, should speak up,' said social media influencer Emily Austin. The conference included a powerful performance by the Special in Uniform Band, earning a tearful standing ovation from the audience. Meanwhile, in the hallways, leaders held meetings to forge business deals and strengthen the Israel-U.S. connection. 'I came to call on all businessmen here in the United States, come and invest in Israel,' said Avi Bleshnikov, Israeli representative of Ron Lauder. 'This is the right time to come and build your future in Israel.' Zaluda added, 'The work continues to be urgent. It may not be emergent, but it continues to be urgent.' Outside the conference venue, demonstrators expressing opposition to the war and the State of Israel staged a Palestinian solidarity protest, including a street sit-in that led to several arrests. Despite the disruption, the conference continued undeterred, with attendees united in a spirit of strength and optimism for the future. 'It’s been an enormously roller coaster year,' said JNF-USA CEO Russel Robinson. 'The good, the bad, the ugly, the pain, the tears, the happiness. And sometimes it is so easy to get caught up in the oy vey. This gives us an opportunity to say, ‘wow, we are winning.’'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk00srdhzjg	2024-11-21T00:01:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/21/B1q6IuhGJl/B1q6IuhGJl_0_0_552_311_0_small.jpg
Report: Israeli strike hits Syrian army, pro-Iran militias, killi...	Opposition watchdog claims pro-Iranian militia sites and Syrian military positions targeted, leaving dozens of Syrian militia operatives, foreign fighters and Hezbollah members, including high-profile figures, dead and wounded Dozens were killed and injured in an Israeli airstrike targeting the city of Palmyra in Syria’s eastern desert on Wednesday, Syrian state media and opposition monitors reported. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attacks. Among the dead were 10 Syrian soldiers, with significant damage to buildings and surrounding areas, according to the Syrian Defense Ministry. The ministry alleged the strike was launched from the vicinity of the U.S. military base at Al-Tanf, near the Syria-Jordan-Iraq tri-border area, and claimed the attack targeted multiple sites in Palmyra. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, reported Thursday that at least 68 people were killed and 50 injured. Among the dead were 42 Syrians linked to pro-Iranian militias, 22 foreign nationals—primarily members of the Iraqi pro-Iranian Nujaba militia—and four Hezbollah operatives. According to the watchdog, the strikes hit three separate locations in Palmyra, including two in the Al-Jam’iya neighborhood, one of which was a weapons depot near an industrial zone. The third site allegedly hosted a meeting of pro-Iranian militia leaders, including senior figures from the Iraqi Nujaba militia and Hezbollah. Families of pro-Iranian operatives, many with Iraqi or foreign citizenship, reportedly reside in the affected area. The Observatory also noted that some of the buildings targeted were located near Palmyra’s famed archaeological sites, although the extent of any impact on the historical landmarks remains unclear. The strikes reportedly began around 1 p.m. local time, with Syrian media outlets reporting explosions in Palmyra, located in the eastern countryside of Homs province. Subsequent reports, including from the Syrian state news agency SANA, indicated strikes on residential buildings and industrial zones in and around the city. Pro-Iranian militia headquarters were also reportedly among the targets.

During the operation, an Israeli aircraft targeted and killed three armed terrorists operating in the sector, some of whom were involved in recent shooting attacks on military positions and Israeli communities. Secondary explosions were observed following the strike, indicating the presence of weapons and explosives in the area, the military said. In subsequent clashes, six additional armed terrorists were killed. Forces also destroyed four bomb-making labs and dozens of explosive devices planted under roadways, according to the IDF.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk2bavnz1l	2024-11-20T23:21:07-08:00	
Russia launches intercontinental ballistic missile in attack on U...	Russia launched an intercontinental ballistic missile from its southern Astrakhan region during a morning attack on Ukraine on Thursday, Kyiv's air force said, the first time Russia has used such a powerful, long-range missile during the war. The strike comes after Ukraine used U.S. and British missiles to strike targets inside Russia this week, something Moscow had warned for months would be seen as a major escalation. The Russian attack targeted enterprises and critical infrastructure in the central-eastern city of Dnipro, the air force said, at a time of escalating moves in the 33-month-old war launched by Russia in Ukraine. It was unclear from the statement what the intercontinental ballistic missile targeted and whether it caused any damage. The missiles have a range of thousands of kilometers and can be used for delivering nuclear warheads, though they can also have conventional warheads. Ukrainian air defenses shot down six Kh-101 cruise missiles during the attack.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryi53v2f1g	2024-11-20T23:18:31-08:00

Bitcoin's march toward $100,000 made further ground on Thursday as investors bet a friendlier U.S. regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies under President-elect Donald Trump will unleash a boom era for the asset class. Bitcoin prices topped $97,000 for the first time in Asia trade, touching a high just above $97,559. The cryptocurrency's price has more than doubled this year and is up about 40% in the two weeks since Trump was voted in as the next U.S. president and a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers were elected to Congress. 'While it's now firmly into overbought territory, it is being drawn toward the $100k level,' said IG Markets analyst Tony Sycamore. Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the 'crypto capital of the planet' and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjmz3d2mkx	2024-11-20T23:16:50-08:00	
Three Palestinians indicted for Hamas plot to assassinate Ben-Gvi...	According to charges, ringleader conducted surveillance on police minister and his son, monitoring their travel routes, vehicles and security arrangements and considered attacking Ben-Gvir upon his arrival at terror scene Three Palestinian residents of the West Bank city of Hebron have been indicted for forming a terror cell to assassinate National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and his eldest son Shuvael, Israeli police announced Thursday. Following a joint investigation by the police and Shin Bet, authorities said they gathered evidence implicating the suspects in the plot. The indictment, submitted to a military court this week, alleges that in June 2024, the primary suspect, Ismail Ibrahim Awadi, sought to establish a cell to acquire weapons and manufacture explosives targeting security forces and senior officials. Awadi reportedly approached Hamas and Hezbollah for funding and training to carry out attacks against Israelis, including prominent figures. According to the indictment, Awadi conducted surveillance on Ben-Gvir and his son, monitoring their travel routes, vehicles and security arrangements. One scenario considered was attacking Ben-Gvir upon his arrival at a terror scene, a routine part of his ministerial duties. The suspects were apprehended earlier this year, and the arresting investigators received commendation from Judea and Samaria District Commander Moshe Pinchi. 'This case exemplifies the extensive efforts of Israel’s enemies to conduct terror operations, targeting a senior minister, his son, security forces and other officials. Arresting and indicting this terror cell represents a significant achievement in the fight against terror and efforts to protect public safety,' said Pinchi. Minister Ben-Gvir expressed gratitude to law enforcement and Shin Bet for foiling the plot. 'I thank the police and Shin Bet for arresting and indicting the terror cell that sought to assassinate me and my son. Thanks to their hard work, and by the grace of God, the enemy’s plan was thwarted,' he said. 'I will continue to push for harsher prison conditions for terrorists, enforce sovereignty and governance in Israel, distribute arms, demolish illegal homes and achieve decisive victory over our enemies. No terrorist will deter me.'

US Senate overwhelmingly rejects Sanders' proposals to halt arms ...	Three proposals by progerssive lawmaker rejected with bipartisan opposition and backing from Biden administration; while Sanders argues aid violated US laws on human rights, opponents emphasize timing, given Israel’s threats from Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran The U.S. Senate decisively rejected overnight Thursday three proposals introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders, a progressive leader within the Democratic Party and outspoken critic of Israel, to halt arms transfers to Israel amid its war in Gaza. The first proposal, which sought to block the transfer of tank shells to Israel, failed with 79 senators opposing and 18 supporting. The second, to stop the delivery of mortar shells, was rejected by a vote of 78-10. The third, aimed at halting the transfer of Boeing's JDAM kits, which convert unguided bombs into precision-guided munitions, was defeated 80-17. All senators voting in favor were Democrats, while members from both parties opposed the measures. The Biden administration also came out against the proposals, sending a letter to Democratic senators ahead of the vote. 'Providing military equipment to Israel is an investment in its long-term security as it faces threats from Iran and elsewhere,' the administration wrote, adding that it is 'working continuously to improve conditions in Gaza.' Sanders introduced six resolutions in total, seeking to block approximately $20 billion in U.S. arms transfers to Israel, but only three were brought to a vote. For decades, strong bipartisan support for Israel in Congress has made it nearly impossible for proposals like those introduced by Sen. Sanders to pass. Still, supporters of the measures hoped a significant showing in the Senate would pressure the Israeli government and the Biden administration to take greater steps to prevent harm to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Ahead of the vote, Sanders argued that U.S. military aid to Israel violates American law prohibiting arms sales to those who commit human rights abuses. He cited the high number of child fatalities in Gaza and accused Israel of blocking humanitarian aid deliveries to the territory. 'It’s time to tell the Netanyahu government that it cannot use American taxpayer dollars and American weapons to violate U.S. and international law and our moral values,' Sanders said. Opponents of the proposals argued that they were poorly timed, as Israel faces threats from Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran. 'Israel is surrounded by enemies dedicated to its destruction,' Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish, said before the votes. Last month, the Biden administration issued an ultimatum to Israel, warning that failure to increase the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza within 30 days could result in a U.S. arms embargo. Last week, at the end of the deadline, Washington announced it had determined that Israel had 'made progress' and was no longer obstructing aid deliveries to the territory. Under U.S. law, Congress has the authority to block major arms sales to foreign countries by passing resolutions like those introduced by Sen. Sanders. Although no such resolution has ever passed Congress and survived a presidential veto, the law requires the Senate to vote on any submitted resolution. Sanders, a prominent figure on the global stage since his surprising performance in the 2016 presidential primaries, is widely credited with forcing Hillary Clinton into a grueling, extended race that some believe contributed to her eventual loss to Donald Trump. An independent rather than a Democrat, Sanders is considered a trailblazer for bringing the progressive wing to the forefront of U.S. politics, garnering widespread support among younger voters. In his youth, Sanders spent time volunteering on Kibbutz Sha'ar HaAmakim in Israel but has since become a vocal critic of Israeli policies.

UK police arrest pro-Palestinian activists over vandalism at Isra...	British police said on Thursday they arrested 10 pro-Palestinian activists from the group Palestine Action on suspicion of vandalizing the offices of Israeli defense company Elbit Systems in Bristol, southwest England. The incident occurred in early August when the activists allegedly broke into the company’s secured production facility armed with axes and hammers, damaging weapons and other equipment. Footage released by the group shows the activists causing property damage and attacking employees who tried to intervene. One worker was reportedly struck on the head. Police officers responding to the scene were also assaulted with hammers. Six suspects were arrested on-site, while others fled. Authorities continued their investigation, leading to the recent arrests.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1sk6inm1l	2024-11-20T22:11:38-08:00

IDF identifies Golani soldier killed in Lebanon clash alongside f...	Sergeant Gur Kehati of 13th Battalion, 20, from Nir Banim, killed in Hezbollah ambush alongside Ze’ev 'Jabo' Erlich, 70; 2 officers sustain moderate and severe injuries in incident The IDF identified on Thursday morning Sergeant Gur Kehati, 20, from Nir Banim, as one of two people killed in a clash with Hezbollah terrorists at an archaeological fortress in southern Lebanon. Kehati, a soldier in the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion, died alongside Ze’ev 'Jabo' Erlich, a 70-year-old historian and geographer known for his research on the Land of Israel. The incident also left a 13th Battalion officer seriously wounded and Golani Brigade Chief of Staff Col. (res.) Yoav Yarom moderately wounded. Yarom, who lost a leg in combat in Lebanon as a young officer, was present at the site, which lies 5-6 kilometers from the border and overlooks Tyre and Lebanon’s coastal plain. The clash occurred Wednesday afternoon in an area under IDF control since earlier operations, according to the military. Yarom and Erlich, armed and wearing protective gear but classified by the IDF as a civilian, were reportedly surveying the fortress near a mosque when two Hezbollah terrorists, who had been hiding there for days, opened fire at close range. The IDF said that Erlich’s presence at the site violated military orders and classified the event as a 'serious and unusual incident.' The military has launched an investigation into the circumstances of Erlich’s entry into Lebanon and his involvement in the operation. Erlich’s family disputes the IDF’s claim that he entered Lebanon as a civilian. 'Contrary to the IDF spokesperson’s claims, we clarify that Jabo was enlisted and treated in the field as a soldier,' his brother, Yigal Amitai, told Ynet. 'He was fully recognized as a soldier, entering Lebanon with the IDF’s approval and accompaniment, albeit for archaeological research, as he always did in Judea and Samaria.' Erlich was a prominent figure in Israeli historical and geographical research, particularly in Judea and Samaria, the biblical names for the different regions of the West Bank. He authored several publications, including Samaria and Benjamin and Judea and Samaria Studies, and was one of the founders of the settlement of Ofra. He is survived by his wife, Tamar, six children and grandchildren.

Family of Israeli scholar killed in Lebanon disputes IDF’s accoun...	Family of Ze’ev ‘Jabo’ Erlich, renowned historian killed in Hezbollah ambush, disputes IDF claim he entered as a civilian, asserting he was formally enlisted and had military approval for his entry; 'Instead of mourning, I’m busy correcting the damage caused by the IDF spokesperson tarnishing his name,' brother says The death of Ze’ev 'Jabo' Erlich, a 70-year-old historian and geographer from Ofra, in a clash with Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon on Wednesday shocked his family and friends. Known for his deep love of exploring every corner of Israel, Erlich, who held the rank of major in the reserves but was present as a civilian, was posthumously recognized as a fallen IDF soldier following the highly unusual incident, which also claimed the life of a Golani Brigade soldier whose name has not yet been released. While the IDF claimed that Erlich entered Lebanon as a civilian, his brother Yigal Amitai disputed this claim. 'Contrary to the IDF spokesperson’s claims, we clarify that Jabo was enlisted and treated in the field as a soldier,' Amitai told Ynet. 'He was fully recognized as a soldier, entering Lebanon with the IDF’s approval and accompaniment, albeit for archaeological research, as he always did in Judea and Samaria.' Amitai said he last spoke with Erlich on Wednesday morning before his entry into Lebanon. 'At 11 a.m., he told me, ‘We’re going into Lebanon.’ The IDF spokesperson is shielding senior officers while shifting blame onto mid-level ranks,' Amitai added. Amitai expressed frustration with how the family was informed. 'We were only notified at 8 p.m. today. Jabo was my eldest brother, one of three siblings. Instead of mourning, I’m busy correcting the damage caused by the IDF spokesperson tarnishing his name,' he said. The IDF acknowledged Erlich’s years of service as a reserve major and decided to grant him a military burial. Erlich, one of the founding figures of the Ofra settlement, was a prominent historian and editor of influential publications such as Samaria and Benjamin and Judea and Samaria Studies. He is survived by his wife Tamar, six children and grandchildren. 'There was nothing Jabo didn’t know about the history and archaeology of Israel,' Amitai said. 'He didn’t just teach knowledge—he conveyed the emotion and depth behind every story. He lived with a profound historical consciousness. We are in complete shock and still processing this heavy loss.' 'This is a tremendous shock. Jabo was a scholar of the Land of Israel who explored every corner,' Pinchas Wallerstein, a close friend of Erlich, told Ynet. 'His knowledge of the country’s history was astounding. We’ve known each other for over 50 years. He guided tours not only in Israel but also in Jordan and other locations. He was a classic figure, deeply familiar with the land and widely respected across all segments of society. He had connections with every senior IDF officer—there isn’t a general who didn’t know Jabo.' Wallerstein added, 'I’m still struggling to process this news. We climbed together last Friday, and he told me he was preparing to enter Lebanon, speaking about some fortress he was surveying. He was part of the founding team that established the Field School in Ofra. I truly cannot comprehend this loss. Jabo was a Renaissance man—there was almost no topic related to the Land of Israel he didn’t know. And it’s important to note that he loved the people of Israel in all their diversity.' Erlich moved to Ofra in 1977, where he worked as a guide for five years at the Field School. It was there that he met his wife, Tamar, who worked as the school’s secretary. The couple was among the first 50 families to build permanent homes in the settlement. He earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Jewish history and Talmudic studies but was also known for his extensive self-directed learning. Erlich’s passion was the Land of Israel and its people. He frequently traveled throughout the country, focusing particularly on remote and unconventional locations in Judea and Samaria, and often wrote articles about his explorations. Yaron Rosenthal, head of the Gush Etzion Regional Council and a friend of Erlich, told Ynet: 'It’s hard to fathom the immense tragedy of losing our dear friend Ze’ev ‘Jabo’ Erlich. Jabo was one of the founding figures in the field of tour guiding and the study of Judea and Samaria. Our generation followed his lead, hanging on his every word. For years, he guided and researched with unparalleled curiosity, exploring every nook and cranny and investigating every archaeological site. Few people had such a profound passion for the land and loved it as deeply as he did. To me, Jabo was also a dear friend and a mentor from whom I learned so much over the years. I will miss him deeply. We will do our best to follow in the footsteps of the giant he was.' Nati Malihi, a close friend of Erlich, paid tribute, writing: 'The man, the mustache, the Bible and the Land of Israel. ‘No need to stand for me,’ he would joke with a wave of his hand, smiling beneath his mustache while holding his Bible marked with hundreds of tabs, as he did every Friday evening before taking his seat two chairs ahead of mine. 'I first met him about 40 years ago when we lived on Har Bracha, Mount Gerizim. Jabo was a regular visitor, welcomed as family by our Samaritan neighbors, whom he studied, knew, loved and shared their secrets with us. Jabo and the Land of Israel. Jabo and the Bible that lived within him. You’d ask him a question and receive a scholarly answer, always with a wink. ‘You can sit down now,’ he would say to all of us. ‘I’m on duty for the study of the Land of Israel.’ May his memory be a blessing.' Moshe Gutman, chairman of the 'Preserving Eternity' coalition for protecting heritage sites in Judea and Samaria, said: '‘Jabo’ was synonymous with knowledge of the land, for hikes through every valley and ruin—a figure worthy of admiration. He was the guide of guides, the teacher of teachers, a legendary man. He loved heritage with all his heart. Wherever you found him, he was immersed in the story of the place—explaining, narrating, questioning, interpreting, connecting and inspiring thought. He was a soldier of heritage, a true Renaissance man, a man of the land. His legacy will forever walk with us, through the trails and sites, the mountains and valleys. Jabo was, and remains, a legend.' Yisrael Ganz, head of the Benjamin Regional Council, said: 'We are shocked by the sudden loss of Jabo. His name was synonymous with knowledge and love for the land. He was a pioneer of settlement and a pillar of the Ofra community. Thousands of land enthusiasts have grown, and will continue to grow, from the discoveries and insights he brought to the world, rooted in his deep love for the Holy Land, its heritage and the history of the Jewish people within it. We share in the profound sorrow of his dear wife Tamar, the entire Erlich family and the Ofra community, embracing them in their grief.' The Yesha Council also paid tribute, describing him as 'a living legend in both life and death, with an extraordinary legacy. A scholar of the Land of Israel who knew every corner and trail. For many years, he volunteered and assisted soldiers across various sectors, sharing his unmatched knowledge of villages and sites.' In the incident where Erlich was killed, a Golani soldier also fell. The soldier’s family has been notified, but his name has not yet been released. Additionally, a soldier from the 13th Battalion was critically injured, and Golani Brigade Chief of Staff Col. (res.) Yoav Yarom sustained moderate injuries. The highly unusual incident occurred around 3 p.m. in an area 5-6 kilometers inside Lebanon, overlooking Tyre and the southern coastal plain. According to the IDF, Although Erlich, a reserve major, volunteered for military service until the age of 70, he entered Lebanon as a civilian. He joined Yarom to survey an ancient fortress near a mosque on a high ridge. Erlich was reportedly armed, wearing protective gear and dressed in military-style clothing. The IDF emphasized that the investigation into the incident is in its early stages. Among the questions being examined are reports that this was not Erlich’s first entry into southern Lebanon with IDF officers in recent weeks and whether his presence was for archaeological research or operational purposes. In an unusual decision, the IDF's new Personnel Directorate head, Maj. Gen. Dado Bar Kalifa, posthumously recognized Erlich as a fallen IDF soldier with active reserve service, granting him the right to a military burial.

Hezbollah rocket strikes northern Israel kindergarten minutes aft...	Shortly after Hezbollah chief concludes speech, terror group launches rocket barrage, striking empty kindergarten in Acre, causing significant damage to building; blast also damaged dozens of nearby homes, sparking renewed fears among residents A barrage of 25 rockets launched by Hezbollah struck the Western Galilee on Wednesday, with one rocket directly hitting the fence of a kindergarten in the coastal city of Acre. No children were present at the time of the strike, but the kindergarten sustained significant damage, and dozens of nearby buildings were also impacted by the blast. The IDF reported that only some of the rockets were intercepted by air defenses. Assi Abutbul, a 25-year-old local, described the aftermath. 'I heard a loud noise and went outside to see a hole in the kindergarten,' he said. 'There were children here this morning. This is not a good situation—not at all.' When asked about the prospects for a cease-fire, Abutbul was dismissive. 'There is no settlement, no security, nothing. It’s all lies. Missiles are hitting kindergartens and schools. There’s no security or agreements—just nonsense.' In response to the attack, the Acre municipality announced the suspension of classes citywide on Thursday and Friday. Mayor Amichai Ben-Shlush conducted a situation assessment at the site and determined that educational institutions would remain closed until at least Sunday. Further decisions will be made following a reassessment on Saturday night. In a conversation with Ynet, Mayor Amichai Ben-Shlush clarified that he does not intend to continue adhering to Home Front Command guidelines, which permit the reopening of classes and transportation. Instead, he ordered the closure of schools, kindergartens and daycares, many of which had only recently reopened for a limited number of students. For the past nine weeks, educational activities in the city have been almost entirely suspended due to the ongoing security situation. Ben-Shlush revealed that about 120 children had been enrolled in the kindergarten that was struck and noted that they had left the premises only about 35 minutes before the rocket hit, at 3:45 p.m. 'It’s a miracle. You can see the hole in the fence,' he said, pointing to the damage caused by the rocket. Ben-Shlush argued that the incident reinforced his belief that fully resuming the education system should be avoided and done 'patiently' and gradually, even if the Home Front Command does not impose restrictions. 'I will act according to my instincts for the safety and security of Acre’s children,' he vowed. The mayor also criticized the government’s handling of the situation. 'The education minister visited the city today and toured with me. I told him again that many educational institutions still lack safe zones,' Ben-Shlush said. 'I described the reality of dozens of schools without protected areas that I cannot safely reopen. Even if the children return, they will fear coming to schools because of the lack of shelter. The older schools are like cardboard. We’ve had a few miracles already, and this was another one. I’m calling on the Israeli government to help us—don’t forsake us.' The barrage was fired immediately after Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem delivered a speech in which he declared that the terrorist organization would continue attacking Israel until a cease-fire agreement is reached. He threatened to target Tel Aviv and central Israel in retaliation for Israeli strikes in Beirut, which have significantly escalated in recent days amid ongoing negotiations. 'We will not leave the capital under fire from the Israeli enemy. When Beirut is under attack by the enemy, the response must target the center of Tel Aviv,' he said, seemingly referring to Tel Aviv as Israel’s capital. 'The enemy must understand that things will not remain as they are when it attacks Beirut.' In his remarks, Qassem addressed the negotiation efforts with Israel, stating that Hezbollah has submitted its comments on the American-brokered proposal and is now awaiting Israel's response. 'The success of the negotiations depends on the Israeli response and Netanyahu's seriousness,' he asserted. He outlined two conditions, which he referred to as 'limits' for the negotiations: a complete halt to what he called 'Israeli aggression' and the preservation of Lebanon's sovereignty. The latter is likely a reference to a contentious clause permitting Israeli freedom of action in response to violations of the agreement. U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Israel on Wednesday evening after visiting Beirut, where he received Hezbollah’s response to an American-brokered cease-fire proposal. Hochstein described the negotiations as having made 'positive progress' and is set to meet shortly with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a close confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Talks will continue Thursday, with Israel’s Security Cabinet convening in the evening for a briefing on the developments. Senior diplomats said an agreement is 'closer than ever,' with 90-95% of the details finalized, but warned that 'the devil is in the details.' They noted that sensitive issues, including the establishment of a monitoring mechanism, remain unresolved. 'There appears to be shared interest in reaching a deal, but key decisions must still be made,' one diplomat said. The proposed monitoring framework would involve significant roles for the U.S., France and Britain, aimed at bolstering the Lebanese Armed Forces through arms and advisory support. Military cooperation from Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates is also expected to play a role in strengthening Lebanon’s military capabilities. Meanwhile, the IDF continues its operations in Lebanon, with the military reporting significant strikes against Hezbollah operatives and infrastructure. On Wednesday, the IDF announced that Israeli Air Force fighter jets had killed Hezbollah’s operations commander and the commander of its anti-tank missile array in a strike on Sunday. According to the military, the two were responsible for multiple attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers, including anti-tank missile strikes on the Western Galilee and central Israel. The IDF said that their elimination deals a significant blow to Hezbollah’s operational capabilities. In southern Lebanon, IDF forces uncovered ammunition depots and seized caches of weapons and equipment during ongoing ground operations. Over the past 24 hours, the Air Force struck more than 100 Hezbollah targets, including rocket launchers, weapons warehouses, command centers and operational buildings, the IDF said.

Civilian, 71, joined IDF forces in Lebanon, killed by Hezbollah	Renowned historian and geographer Ze'ev H. Erlich reportedly entered Lebanon in violation of operational orders and ambushed by terrorists while surveying ancient fortress in Tyre sector Ze’ev H. Erlich, a 71-year-old Israeli historian and geographer, was killed Wednesday by Hezbollah gunfire while accompanying Israeli forces in southern Lebanon. The incident, described by the military as 'serious and unusual,' occurred around 3 p.m. in an operational zone roughly 5-6 kilometers from the border, overlooking Tyre and Lebanon’s southern coastal plain. The IDF said Erlich, a civilian armed with a personal weapon and wearing military attire and protective gear, was present in the area alongside Col. Yoav Yarom, chief of staff of the Golani Brigade. Yarom, a veteran who lost a leg in combat in Lebanon years earlier, was visiting a site where an Israeli soldier had been killed earlier in the week. The area has been under IDF operational control since. The pair began surveying an ancient fortress near a mosque situated on a high ridge when two Hezbollah operatives, who had reportedly been hiding in the sector for days, opened fire at close range, fatally striking Erlich. The IDF said the circumstances of his presence in the area are under investigation, including whether he was there for archaeological purposes or part of an operational mission. Preliminary findings indicate that Erlich’s entry into the area violated operational orders. The military is also probing reports suggesting that this was not his first time accompanying IDF officers into southern Lebanon in recent weeks.

Man, suffering from advanced liver condition, claims enduring beatings, death threats and antisemitic harassment in prison; 'They tell him all Jews must be killed; I’m afraid he won’t survive this,' wife says An Israeli man arrested in Greece last month on a German extradition warrant has reported severe abuse by Muslim inmates while awaiting a court decision. His wife claims he has been targeted for being Jewish, enduring beatings, death threats and antisemitic harassment in prison. 'They tell him all Jews must be killed, and he’s in terrible fear,' she said. 'I fear for his life. He calls me crying every day, saying he’s being beaten and threatened. He is terrified and can’t sleep.' She added that her husband hasn’t eaten because authorities won’t allow him kosher food. 'My husband is sick, with 75% disability, and I’m afraid he won’t survive this,' she added. 'The Foreign Ministry and the embassy in Greece are not helping at all. They haven’t even visited him — I haven’t received a single phone call. We’re so disappointed in Israel for not offering help. 'He won’t survive there. He’s begging to be released, saying they hate Jews. There is severe antisemitism there.' The couple has three children, who have not been attending school since the incident. 'We’re in a financial and emotional crisis,' she said. The 42-year-old man from Rehovot, who suffers from advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, was arrested in October while vacationing on the Greek island of Rhodes. Germany has accused him of participating in a €300,000 fraud scheme, a charge that could carry a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence if convicted. Initially hospitalized due to his health condition, the man was briefly granted bail but was returned to custody after collapsing in court. He is currently detained in Athens, awaiting an appeal on the extradition decision. The man’s attorney, Mordechai Tzivin, wrote to the Foreign Ministry urging immediate intervention, citing his client’s critical health and the alleged mistreatment by Muslim inmates. 'He is being harassed, denied food and constantly threatened,' Tzivin said. 'He is so desperate he has expressed suicidal thoughts to his wife.' The Foreign Ministry has not yet commented on the case.

Devil’s in the details': Lebanon cease-fire agreement near, dipl...	Sources say '90-95%' of agreement finalized but key details, including monitoring mechanism, unresolved; Hezbollah chief confirms terror group submitted response to US proposal, warning deal hinges on Israel halting 'aggression' and respecting Lebanon’s sovereignty U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Israel on Wednesday evening after visiting Beirut, where he received Hezbollah’s response to an American-brokered cease-fire proposal. Hochstein described the negotiations as having made 'positive progress' and is set to meet shortly with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a close confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Talks will continue Thursday, with Israel’s Security Cabinet convening in the evening for a briefing on the developments. Senior diplomats said an agreement is 'closer than ever,' with 90-95% of the details finalized, but warned that 'the devil is in the details.' They noted that sensitive issues, including the establishment of a monitoring mechanism, remain unresolved. 'There appears to be shared interest in reaching a deal, but key decisions must still be made,' one diplomat said. The proposed monitoring framework would involve significant roles for the U.S., France and Britain, aimed at bolstering the Lebanese Armed Forces through arms and advisory support. Military cooperation from Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates is also expected to play a role in strengthening Lebanon’s military capabilities. Hezbollah’s newly appointed leader, Naim Qassem, who assumed the role last month following the assassinations of Hassan Nasrallah and his original successor-designate Hashem Safieddine, delivered a speech Wednesday afternoon addressing ongoing negotiations with Israel. Amid threats issued during his remarks, Qassem confirmed that Hezbollah had submitted its comments on the U.S.-brokered proposal and is now awaiting Israel’s response. 'The success of the negotiations depends on Israel’s response and Netanyahu’s seriousness,' Qassem said. He emphasized two key conditions, which he referred to as the 'red lines' for the talks: a complete halt to what he called 'Israeli aggression' and the preservation of Lebanon’s sovereignty—likely referencing disputes over Israel’s demand for freedom of action in the event of violations of the agreement.

According to officials, decisions on key issues, including a monitoring mechanism, are pending. While there appears to be shared interest in reaching a deal, disputes remain. The agreement is expected to involve significant U.S., French and British support for Lebanon’s military, including arms and advisory aid, as well as contributions from the armed forces of Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rklaxqjg1x	2024-11-20T07:57:31-08:00	
5th grader left outside shelter amid Hezbollah rocket attack in c...	Kfar Saba grade school student left crying and frightened outside shelter during rocket sirens after staff refused to reopen door; child was in the bathroom when the alert sounded and unable to reach shelter in time; Education Ministry: 'serious lapse in judgment' A 5th-grade student at Yitzhak Sadeh Elementary School in the central city of Kfar Saba was left outside a shelter during a Hezbollah rocket attack on Tuesday, sparking outrage from parents and prompting an apology from the Education Ministry According to parents, the student was delayed in reaching the shelter because he was in the bathroom when the sirens sounded. By the time he arrived, the door had already been closed. Educational staff reportedly refused to reopen it, citing safety procedures meant to protect those already inside in the event of a direct hit. The child was instructed to lie on the ground and cover his head as his classmates pleaded for him to be let in. 'His friends begged for him, but he was left crying outside the shelter,' parents said. 'The child is traumatized, and so are his friends and us.' A mother of another student at the school called the decision 'a terrible blunder,' questioning the protocols used. 'They claimed these are the procedures, but who set them? The child was just a minute late—he was right by the shelter. How can you leave him outside?' she said. The Education Ministry condemned the handling of the incident, calling it a 'serious lapse in judgment.' In a statement, the ministry emphasized that no child should ever be left out of a shelter during an emergency. 'We will review the incident and immediately refresh emergency procedures to ensure this does not happen again,' the statement read. Parents expressed ongoing concern over the incident, with one mother saying she now feels anxious about sending her daughter to school. 'These are little kids. They’re already dealing with daily anxiety from everything going on, and now this? If it were their child, would they leave them outside?'

US vetoes UN Security Council cease-fire resolution on Gaza	Washington rejects truce without release of hostages, including 7 Americans, emphasizing, 'Hamas, not Israel, obstructing deal'; Israeli envoy praises move, condemning resolution as enabling terrorism and reaffirming Israel’s stance against cease-fire without hostage release The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza without conditions, including the release of hostages held by Hamas. The resolution was supported by 14 council members, leaving the U.S. as the sole opponent. The U.S. representative cited the ongoing captivity of seven American citizens among the hostages held by Hamas. 'Hamas, not Israel, is obstructing a deal that could include a temporary cease-fire,' the envoy said. Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon praised the U.S. for its stance, reiterating that no cease-fire would occur without the release of hostages. 'Today, we prevented a disgraceful attempt by the UN to abandon our captives. Thanks to the U.S., we upheld the critical principle: the hostages must be freed. We will continue fighting until all of them are home,' Danon said. Danon also criticized the 14 council members who supported the resolution, accusing them of enabling terrorism. 'You have reached a new low. You failed to uphold justice and peace, abandoning your basic responsibility to those who need you most. This resolution supported Hamas' terror,' he said. The vote came a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz visited the Netzarim Corridor in Gaza. Netanyahu vowed that 'Hamas will no longer rule Gaza' and urged Gaza residents to help locate hostages, offering a $5 million reward for information leading to their recovery. A senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity ahead of the vote, said the U.S. would only support a resolution that explicitly calls for the immediate release of hostages as part of a cease-fire. 'As we stated many times before, we just can't support an unconditional cease-fire that does not call for the immediate release of hostages,' the official said.

US vetoes UN Security Council resolution on Gaza cease-fire	The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council resolution for a cease-fire in Israel's war in Gaza, accusing council members of cynically rejecting attempts at reaching a compromise. The 15-member council voted on a resolution put forward by its 10 non-permanent members in a meeting that called for an 'immediate, unconditional and permanent cease-fire' and separately demanded the release of hostages. Only the U.S. voted against, using its veto as a permanent council member to block the resolution. A senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity ahead of the vote, said the U.S. would only support a resolution that explicitly calls for the immediate release of hostages as part of a cease-fire.

US envoy heads to Israel as Lebanon talks show promise, but chall...	Following progress in Beirut talks, Amos Hochstein set to arrive in Israel overnight; Jerusalem officials express cautious optimism but acknowledge remaining gaps, particularly over monitoring mechanism White House special envoy Amos Hochstein, who has been in Beirut for several days mediating talks between Israel and Hezbollah, is expected to arrive in Israel overnight Thursday to present Lebanon and Hezbollah’s responses to a proposed U.S.-drafted de-escalation agreement. Following his meeting with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who is leading the talks on Hezbollah’s behalf, Hochstein described the talks as 'very constructive and very helpful' and said that the parties 'have continued to narrow the gaps.' Israeli officials believe Hochstein will push Lebanon to compromise on key issues, particularly regarding the mechanism for monitoring the enforcement of the agreement. Lebanon reportedly opposes the inclusion of Britain and Germany in the deal, preferring Arab nations such as Egypt and Jordan, while Israel insists on a framework led by a U.S. CENTCOM general. Lebanese and Arab media, including outlets affiliated with Hezbollah, widely covered the ongoing negotiations. While most reported significant progress, they acknowledged unresolved issues. Sky News Arabia cited sources close to Berri who claimed that 'nearly 80% of the cease-fire agreement has been finalized.' The pro-Hezbollah newspaper Al-Akhbar reported that there is 'understanding on all draft clauses,' but noted that discussions now focus on border-related issues, which remain shrouded in secrecy. Israel is cautiously optimistic ahead of Hochstein’s upcoming meetings in Israel on Thursday. Meanwhile, Defense Minister Israel Katz visited a military intelligence base in central Israel, emphasizing that 'the prerequisite for any political agreement in Lebanon is preserving intelligence capabilities and ensuring the IDF's right to operate and defend Israeli citizens against Hezbollah.' This point—freedom of operation—has been a significant sticking point during the negotiations. Mahmoud Kamati, deputy head of Hezbollah's political council, said that any cease-fire agreement 'must end the war quickly' while preserving Lebanon’s sovereignty. In an interview with Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Manar TV, Kamati said he was 'neither very optimistic nor very pessimistic' about the prospects for an agreement. Similarly, senior Hezbollah official Hassan Fadlallah told Lebanon’s Al-Jadeed TV, 'No one in Lebanon accepts a breach of its sovereignty or granting freedom of movement to the enemy. The war will not end on the enemy’s terms.' The draft agreement reportedly includes a 60-day cease-fire trial period during which Hezbollah would withdraw beyond the Litani River, leaving only the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL forces in southern Lebanon. If the cease-fire holds, the IDF would then withdraw from southern Lebanon. Despite broad agreement on many clauses, two key issues remain unresolved: the IDF’s freedom of operation and the composition of the monitoring committee overseeing the implementation of UN Resolution 1701. According to Lebanese sources cited by Sky News Arabia, a revised clause was agreed upon during Hochstein's visit to Beirut, stating that 'each side has the right to self-defense if attacked, provided that the U.S. ensures Israel does not conduct preemptive strikes.' If the parties reach an agreement, Washington is expected to announce the start of the cease-fire, marking the beginning of the implementation phase. This would test whether Hezbollah retreats beyond the Litani and if the Lebanese Army takes over southern Lebanon. During this period, the IDF will remain in the south of the country, though adjustments to its operational deployment are expected. Ultimately, the plan envisions only the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL forces remaining in southern Lebanon. The cease-fire announcement may also involve French participation, acting as a guarantor for Lebanon. In 2006, a similar cease-fire agreement was reached, but its enforcement mechanism collapsed on the ground. This time, however, a more robust mechanism involving the UK, Germany, France and others has been devised. Israel has retained the right, under the agreement, to enforce the cease-fire and maintain operational freedom if violations occur.

Bitcoin rises above $94,000 for the first time	Bitcoin rose to a record high above $94,000 as a report that Donald Trump's social media company was in talks to buy crypto trading firm Bakkt boosted expectations of a crypto-friendly regime under his incoming administration. Bitcoin, the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, has more than doubled this year. It was last at $93,521 on Wednesday, having hit a high of $94,078 in early Asian trading hours. The Financial Times said Trump Media and Technology Group , which operates Truth Social, is close to an all-stock acquisition of Bakkt, which is backed by NYSE-owner Intercontinental Exchange. 'Trump's seeming interest to push further into crypto on a personal level has contributed to optimism that crypto will be a top priority when Trump takes office,' said Stephane Ouellette, chief executive officer of crypto trading firm FRNT Financial. Cryptocurrencies have soared since the Nov. 5 U.S. election as traders bet President-elect Trump's promised support for digital assets would lead to a less restrictive regulatory regime.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1n0tusgkg	2024-11-20T04:02:58-08:00

Paying the ultimate price: 800 IDF soldiers have fallen since Oct...	The war's relentless toll on Israel echoes through its fallen troops, with 800 soldiers killed since Hamas' surprise attack, marking a loss unseen since the Yom Kippur War; These are the numbers behind Israel's staggering losses Since the unexpected assault by Hamas on October 7, 2023, the toll on IDF has been profound, with 800 soldiers giving their lives to protect the nation. Among them, 757 men and 43 women have fallen, including 28 during the ongoing operation in the northern Gaza Strip, especially around Jabaliya. This staggering loss is something Israel and IDF have not confronted in over 51 years, not since the Yom Kippur War. Valiant troops have fallen every single month since the start of the war. October 2023 stands out as the bloodiest month, with 342 casualties, most of whom died on that horrific Saturday, saving countless lives and preventing Hamas terrorists from advancing deeper into Israel. In the months that followed, as the IDF has engaged in ground maneuvers in the Gaza Strip and later in Lebanon, there have been notable military achievements that will be discussed for years to come, but the cost is heavy. In December alone, 110 soldiers were killed. This October, marking a year of war, was dubbed 'Black October,' with 62 soldiers falling in combat. The current conflict is being waged on multiple fronts: The southern front since October 26, 2023, the northern front where ground maneuvers began on September 30, 2024, and ongoing security fronts, primarily in the West Bank. In the Gaza Strip, 375 soldiers, including one female soldier, have fallen since operations began, 44 in Lebanon, and 11 in the West Bank. There have also been losses on the northern front, primarily due to drone and missile attacks launched by Hezbollah from Lebanon. In this war, 272 reserve soldiers have fallen in battle. Much has been said about the mobilization of the reserves, a scale unseen since the establishment of the state. Many understood the significance of the moment on the morning of October 7 and reported for duty – many without having received call-up orders, and some beyond the age of exemption – leaving behind families, children, jobs and businesses, and paying — and still paying — an unbearable emotional and familial price. Additionally, 143 career soldiers have fallen. The rest are conscripted troops, young people under 22 who hadn't yet begun their lives, with dreams, plans and aspirations abruptly cut short. The fallen have left behind 181 widows, most of whom are mothers, including 27 women who were pregnant when their partners died. The grim statistics include 44 families suffering multiple losses, who have faced the dreadful knock on their door more than once, including siblings who became bereaved parents, bereaved fathers who are also bereaved uncles, grandparents who buried more than one grandchild, and other heart-wrenching cases. Furthermore, the 'Left Behind a Friend' organization reported that there are 327 bereaved partners since the war began. IDF commanders have been leading from the front since the fighting started, guiding soldiers to operational achievements across all fronts. When the ethos of 'Follow Me' becomes a reality, the human cost is significant. About a quarter of all casualties are officers. In the current war, the IDF has lost 69 platoon leaders, 20 deputy company commanders, 63 company commanders, seven deputy battalion commanders, five battalion commanders, and four brigade commanders. The IDF website has published the dates of death for all the soldiers, except for four – Sergeant Ron Sherman, Corporal Nick Beiser, Corporal Noa Marciano, and Master Sergeant Ori Danino. Sherman and Beiser, who were documented as being kidnapped alive, were killed in Gaza alongside Elia Toledano. Their bodies were rescued and returned by the IDF. Two months ago, the IDF determined that it is highly probable the three were killed as a 'byproduct of an IDF airstrike during the elimination of senior Hamas member Ahmed Randor on November 10, 2023.' The IDF also retrieved the body of lookout Noa Marciano, who was murdered in captivity at al-Shifa Hospital by Hamas terrorists. Danino went to enjoy the Nova Festival. He was kidnapped to Gaza and murdered in Hamas captivity along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Alex Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, and Carmel Gat. The IDF discovered their bodies in late August.

The elimination of these commanders further degrade Hezbollah’s ability to carry out terror attacks from southern Lebanon against Israeli civilians. Additionally, IDF troops are continuing limited, localized, targeted raids in southern Lebanon to remove threats to Israeli civilians. The forces located weapons storage facilities and struck terrorist command centers and sites during joint ground and aerial activity. Over the past day, the IAF struck over 100 terror targets in Lebanon, including launchers, weapons storage facilities, command centers and military structures.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj3ezhofkg	2024-11-20T02:07:38-08:00

IDF reservist Roi Sasson fell in Jabaliya, 2nd soldier seriously ...	Terrorists ambushed a building in the northern Gaza Strip, and the 21-year-old reservist was killed; His mother recalls their last conversation: 'I told him, get out of there. The day he entered Gaza, my heart fell'; 800 IDF soldiers have died since the start of the war Sergeant First Class (res.) Roi Sasson, 21, from Mevaseret Zion, a solder in the Nachshon Battalion of the Kfir Brigade fell Tuesday in an encounter with terrorists in Jabaliya, the IDF announced on Wednesday morning. In the same incident, the commander of the Nachshon Battalion, Kfir Brigade, Lt. Col. Yoel Glickman, was seriously injured, though his life is not in danger. Since the outbreak of the war, 800 IDF soldiers have died in battles, 28 of them in the current operation in Jabaliya. A preliminary investigation of the encounter reveals that the force under Glickman's command was ambushed by a terrorist squad that was waiting inside a building, and came at the end of the battalion's attack on a target in the seam between Beit Lahia and Jabaliya. 'Yesterday evening I was informed, it was the hardest thing I ever had to hear and experience in my life from the moment my son entered Gaza, and he has been a soldier for three years. That's four months of reserve that they added to the three years,' Osnat Gal, Roi's mother told Ynet. 'He was a class commander, in Lebanon he replaced a soldier who had to leave for medical reasons. There was no manpower. He was in charge of many soldiers, and fulfilled the position with distinction.' 'Then he moved to the West Bank and he was there in several places. The last place was Nablus. As soon as he told me he entered Gaza, my heart fell. I accompanied him to the entrance to Gaza on November 1. He entered happy, said he was privileged to contribute to the country and be there for those who need him. We spoke for the last time on Saturday, after a few very difficult days. I told him, 'If you can get out, please get out.' He didn't worry, he was happy to be there and felt that he was doing something, that he was contributing.' She added that Roi 'was a boy who, even if he was uncomfortable, would do things for others first. From the Scouts when he was a guide, to when he helped injured people. He was always giving. I lost the most precious thing in the world. He was a handsome boy, with green eyes .A boy with values. A true gentleman. Took care of others. He called his grandmother every Shabbat evening to ask how she is.' She said that Roi was expected to leave Gaza on Thursday, and to be released in three weeks. 'He went with dedication. He finished the regular service and then went to four months of reserve, which he did not survive. He loved his family, friends and fellow soldiers, and most of all he loved the country. I asked him to leave already, I couldn't handle all the 'permission to publish' notices of fallen soldiers , but my daughters told me that he was looking for another place to serve, even in other divisions, he was not afraid. He wanted to fight for his country. The 800th fallen, I'm sure it has meaning. I understood that they saw a terrorist in the house in Jabaliya, and proceeded to clear the area. I understood that he was shot and killed on the spot,' she said. On Sunday, the Nachshon Battalion lost two more soldiers who fell in the battle in Jabaliya, Captain Yogev Pazy and Staff sergeant Noam Eitan. A day before, Sergeant first class (res.) Idan Kenan Cohen from the battalion also fell in battle. Glickman, who was seriously injured in the encounter with the terrorists, was appointed to the position of battalion commander this year. When the war broke out on October 7, he was sent to the Gaza border area where he fought for many days in the kibbutzim, including Be'eri. Ten days later, his daughter was born. A day before he was seriously injured, Glickman recorded from the combat zone a eulogy for Pazy to be played at his funeral. 'We are continuing the mission,' Glickman said in the recording. 'It was important for you to always be first in every attack. You were an unconventional commander. We are in a war for Israel's existence, no less. We will continue on your way, Pazy.'

IDF establishes new defensive positions on Lebanon border as ceas...	Official cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah remains unfinalized, so the IDF is proactively setting up new outposts near the border with Lebanon, refurbishing old military positions and forming combat units to provide visible security and support for returning residents An official cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah remains elusive, yet the IDF is proactively establishing new outposts near border communities along the Lebanese border. The military is refurbishing former outposts and preparing to station combat units within communities, ensuring returning residents feel secure with a visible military presence. In recent weeks, the IDF has dismantled concrete walls and firing positions along confrontation line roads, which had become a gray fixture of the landscape. It has also withdrawn military forces from public buildings and evacuated areas, while working with local authorities to shape a new security framework. In Shlomi, situated right on the border, where over 7,000 residents were evacuated in October 2023, the local council has recently installed permanent firing and defense positions around the community facing Lebanon, ready for any alert. Additionally, a military outpost with at least a company-sized force will secure the community. This week, the Shlomi local council plans to approve three security tenders developed in anticipation of future needs. These include establishing an extensive camera network operated by a 24/7 active center, budgeting $6.6 million for a tactical combat unit patrolling around the clock with off-road vehicles, and forming a rapid response force of 60 volunteer fighters from the community. These measures have been approved by the IDF Northern Command and the Chief of Staff, according to Gabi Naaman, head of the Shlomi Council. In recent days, senior military commanders, including brigade leaders from Golani, Kfir and the 228th Brigade, have consistently urged displaced northern residents to 'return home now' through every available media platform. These military pressures, lacking clear and coordinated statements from political leaders, are viewed by many as unauthorized interference and a detriment to the war objectives expected in the north. Naaman also sought to temper the enthusiastic calls for residents to return home, emphasizing essential conditions: 'For us to return home, several critical things must happen,' he told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth. 'One is for IDF to position itself north of Shlomi, on the mountain and into the Lebanese side, to prevent any certain infiltration. We also expect soldiers to be visibly present in front of us and within Shlomi itself, not behind us. The third requirement is completing the installation of defensive technological means to create a sense of security and visibility.' Amid frantic U.S.-pressured talks to reach a settlement to end the war in Lebanon, Naaman expressed hope that the government will prioritize national interests over global ones. 'We do not trust fabricated agreements, so the IDF must maintain a security zone for at least the coming years to ensure Hezbollah does not plan another attack on northern communities. These are the minimum conditions. It's important that the IDF remains assertive and does everything to empower politicians to negotiate the best possible agreement. I trust the prime minister more than anyone else,' he said. Naaman said the IDF should drive the required strategic change, not politicians. 'The IDF is our strength and, unfortunately, also our weakness. If we end the war like a month ago, Hezbollah will only grow stronger. We don't want to beg for an agreement; we want them to be the ones begging for it,' he said. On Tuesday, Naaman, along with other local authority heads from the confrontation line, met with the new minister Ze'ev Elkin, responsible for the northern and southern administrations. Authorities have high hopes that he will succeed in rallying all government ministries to the challenge of developing the area. Naaman announced before the meeting his intention to urge Elkin to create certainty for over 60,000 northern evacuees. 'I will ask him to promote a government decision to extend the stay outside the community, as well as the benefits for residents, not just until the end of December but beyond, to provide calm for residents and ensure their return is gradual, not rushed or under distress as the evacuation was. All this, of course, on the condition the IDF provides absolute security, achieving the main objective of the war in the north and not a moment before.' Keeping a visible contact line whether an agreement is reached this week or postponed, IDF troops continue daily operations beyond the border to expose more areas and 'clean' the buffer zone, previously tangled and concealed from the army's view. In the western sector, engineering forces and the 146th Division fighters lead the 'plowing' efforts on the ground. The military warns that without daily maintenance of this line – from the sea at Rosh Hanikra to Mount Dov – to ensure it remains clear, or without physically remaining there, it will be challenging to guarantee security for residents along the border line. Already now, after heavy rains, vegetation is growing again, and must be cleared. This will likely be a sticking point with Hezbollah, which will insist on withdrawing all Israeli forces beyond the border fence, potentially creating a significant obstacle in any emerging arrangement. There is concern that the Iranian-funded terrorist organization will quickly seek to cover the area again with dense, concealing foliage. Residents can no longer agree to a demand that would return the obscured view the army suffered from before October 6, 2023. Alongside targeted raids in southern Lebanon, with relatively fewer forces than those in Lebanon in recent weeks, the IDF reports that the maneuver to thwart the northern attack plan has been completed, and forces await further instructions from the political echelon. A senior military source noted that, under current conditions, residents can begin renovating damaged homes and preparing them for their return. This is based on the assumption that, following the rocket fire pushed away from the contact line with Israel, it is safer to move around evacuated communities than it was in the past year. The IDF assesses that the current rocket threat from Hezbollah is not significantly different between many evacuated communities and cities like Nahariya, Acre, or communities adjacent to Haifa such as Kiryat Motzkin, all of which are targeted daily.

France says window of opportunity open for Lebanon cease-fire	France's foreign minister said on Wednesday that U.S.-led efforts for a truce between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon had created the chance for a lasting cease-fire and he called on both sides to accept a deal on the table. 'There is a window of opportunity that's opening for a lasting ceasefire in Lebanon that would allow the return of those displaced, ensure the sovereignty of Lebanon and the security of Israel,' Jean-Noel Barrot told Europe 1 radio.

With military outposts and tacit approval from the coalition: Thi...	Analysis: After Gallant's dismissal and in view of the new US administration, Israel is working to establish facts on the ground in order to have de facto control of the strip, but without a political decision which could involve many and weighty legal consequences; This corresponds with the settlers' plans to settle in northern Gaza; 'A historic opportunity returns' Israel appears to be on its way to realizing the idea of ​​a military administration in the Gaza Strip. In view of actions on the ground, it seems that Israel has increased its activity toward implementation of the move. Netanyahu's senior coalition members, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, have already expressed their opinion on the matter countless times, but now things seem to be getting a push on the ground. Ynet has learned that, in the last few days, the security establishment is beginning to actively work with external companies that will handle all humanitarian aid issues in the Gaza Strip, under Israeli supervision. This is the realization on the ground of plans that previously were only on paper. In addition, the IDF has deepened its seizure of territory in the Gaza Strip, expanding the axes it holds and establishing military outposts seemingly in order to seize a wide area and apply military administration in practice in the Gaza Strip. In recent days, lively discussions have been held on the issue between the various parties, including new Defense Minister Israel Katz, senior members of the defense establishment and other senior ministers, in order to promote the policy. According to sources familiar with the details, some officials in the Southern Command are pushing from within the system for the implementation of military administration of the strip, and are creating a dialogue with the political echelon on the matter. The move comes against the backdrop of two significant changes that delayed the cabinet members to the right of Netanyahu, and have now been removed: In Israel, the replacement of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant; and in the U.S., the victory of Donald Trump in presidential elections. Sources familiar with the details say that Gallant opposed Smotrich's ideas the West Bank and Gaza, and supported the position of the security system on a variety of issues. Among other things, Gallant opposed Smotrich's position on the demolition of outposts, issuing administrative arrest warrants for extreme right-wing activists, and on the day after in the Gaza Strip. At the same time, the plans for seizing the territory as part of extracting a price from Hamas in Gaza correspond with settlers' plans to settle northern Gaza. Officials in the settlement movement claim that this is a historic period of time to change reality on the ground vis-a-vis the Palestinians, and an opportunity that will not return. The same sources claim that a decision was made to not wait for the new Trump administration to enter the White House, but to already carry out operations on the ground and build plans that will form the basis for the activities of the new administration. In this context, a senior official in the settlement movement explains that the main thing is to 'maintain the integrity of the coalition at all costs.' Although no political decision has been made regarding the day after in the Gaza Strip, the main point of which is the establishment of a military administration, the government is dealing with it and working toward its realization. Besides the economic, logistical, infrastructural and security consequences of establishing a military administration, there are also far-reaching legal consequences regarding control over millions of Palestinians and the need to treat them humanitarianly. Legal sources point to a serious lack of clarity on the question of what Israel will do with Gaza after 13 months of war. Civilian control in Gaza means that Israel will be required to provide for the needs of the population –such as humanitarian aid, electricity, communications and sanitation - and not just allow international organizations to deliver food and vaccines. In the absence of a decision by the political echelon, Israel has in recent months been forced to deal with petitions to the High Court regarding the 'occupation' of the Gaza Strip - which involves many and weighty legal consequences about the treatment of the population, and also with international proceedings such as those conducted at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Another solution that is also on the table and which is not being promoted at all is giving control of Gaza Strip to another entity in the territory, such as the Palestinian Authority. This is a solution to which Netanyahu and members of his government are strongly opposed. Alternatively, it is possible that another country will take responsibility for the strip, but most are opposed to the idea as long as Israel's fighting in Gaza continues.

Russia had been warning the West for months that if Washington allowed Ukraine to fire U.S., British and French missiles deep into Russia, Moscow would consider those NATO members to be directly involved in the war in Ukraine.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b17cxbogyg	2024-11-19T21:39:16-08:00

A rare bird, the Bearded Reedling, has been spotted by bird watcher Dov Leibowitz in the Beersheba River Park. This songbird, once thought to be extinct, is highly regarded among Israeli bird watchers as a rare and much sought-after species. Its last documented sighting in Israel was in 1995 in the Hula Valley. To date, Bearded Reedlings have been documented in Israel only 12 times, nearly all during the 1980s, making this sighting exceptionally rare.

Biden approves anti-personnel mines for Ukraine, US official says	President Joe Biden has approved provision of anti-personnel land mines to Ukraine, a U.S. official told Reuters, a step that could help slow Russian advances in its east, especially when used along with other munitions from the United States. The United States expects Ukraine to use the mines in its own territory, though it has committed not to use them in areas populated with its own civilians, the official said. The Washington Post first reported the development. The United States has provided Ukraine with anti-tank mines throughout its war with Russia, but the addition of anti-personnel mines aims at blunting the advance of Russian ground troops, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity. The U.S. mines differ from Russia's as they are 'non-persistent,' and become inert after a preset period, the official said. They require a battery to detonate, and will not explode once the battery runs out.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj1rqkom1x	2024-11-19T19:52:02-08:00

Turkey blocks Herzog's plane from airspace, Erdogan boasts	President Isaac Herzog reportedly canceled trip to UN climate conference in Baku after Turkey barred official Wing of Zion plane from airspace Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan confirmed Tuesday that Turkey barred the Israeli presidential plane, Wing of Zion, from using its airspace en route to a UN climate conference in Azerbaijan. 'We did not allow the Israeli president to use our airspace to attend the COP summit. We suggested alternative routes and options,' Erdogan told reporters at the G20 Summit in Brazil. 'On certain matters, as Turkey, we are compelled to take a stand, and we will continue to do so,' he added. The decision follows Turkey’s withdrawal of its ambassador to Israel for consultations after the Gaza war began, though diplomatic ties remain intact, and Turkey's embassy in Tel Aviv remains operational. Erdogan also noted that Turkey has severed trade ties with Israel over the war. President Isaac Herzog had planned to attend the climate conference in Baku on Tuesday aboard the Wing of Zion, the official plane for Israel’s president and prime minister. On Saturday, Herzog’s office announced the trip’s cancellation, citing 'security reasons' following a situation assessment. Sources in Israel, however, said that the Turkish airspace ban was a contributing factor but not the primary reason for canceling the visit. Security concerns stemming from alternate flight routes due to the Russia-Ukraine war also played a role, officials said. Additionally, Herzog’s recent trip to the U.S. to meet outgoing President Joe Biden meant he would have missed key leadership discussions at the climate summit, reducing the importance of the Baku visit. Diplomatic tensions arose as Azerbaijan sought to reframe the cancellation’s narrative, expressing displeasure with Israeli media reports. While Herzog canceled, other Israeli ministers attended the conference, traveling on commercial flights through Georgia. It remains unclear why Herzog did not opt for a similar travel arrangement.

Trump opposes Israeli West Bank sovereignty move, senior Republic...	While settlers euphoric and Smotrich hails 2025 as ‘year of sovereignty,’ senior Republicans warn president-elect opposes move, fearing it could jeopardize normalization with Saudi Arabia Despite enthusiasm from the Israeli right and pro-Israel conservatives following Donald Trump’s election as U.S. president, senior Republicans say Trump opposes applying Israeli sovereignty to Judea and Samaria, the biblical names for the areas of the West Bank. 'Trump will not approve annexation,' said a senior Republican senator close to the president-elect, calling such a move 'a mistake for Israel' that would worsen its international standing. The senator’s remarks follow speculation that recent Trump appointments, including Mike Huckabee as U.S. ambassador to Israel, signal support for annexation. Reports suggest Trump is concerned annexation could derail efforts to secure normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a top priority for the incoming administration. Veteran Senator Lindsey Graham is working on a deal to finalize the normalization agreement, coordinating with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, outgoing President Joe Biden and Trump himself. Sources say Graham sees bipartisan Senate approval of a U.S.-Saudi defense pact as key to achieving normalization. In Israel, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has labeled 2025 the 'year of sovereignty,' signaling annexation ambitions. However, senior Israeli political sources suggest Smotrich’s rhetoric is aimed at shoring up support among his base amid controversies over the ultra-Orthodox draft exemption law. While the settlers prepare to push annexation plans under the new U.S. administration, the likelihood of American recognition remains uncertain. Analysts say it could hinge on concessions to Palestinians as part of a broader Trump-led regional deal, raising questions about Smotrich and far-right ally Itamar Ben-Gvir’s willingness to compromise. Smotrich has expressed frustration with the outgoing Biden administration's embargo on working with him, saying, 'I look forward to working with the elected administration to strengthen economic and commercial ties.' At a faction meeting last week, he called Trump's victory 'an important opportunity for Israel,' adding, 'We were a step away from applying sovereignty, and now is the time to do it.' Smotrich reiterated his opposition to a Palestinian state, citing 'broad consensus in the coalition and opposition that it would endanger Israel’s existence.'

Israel explores security partnership with US firm for Gaza aid pi...	The defense establishment is in talks with the U.S.-based security firm Orbis, led by former U.S. Army generals, to explore a potential pilot project in northern Gaza, officials said Tuesday. The proposal was discussed in a meeting convened by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with Defense Minister Israel Katz, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. Sources familiar with the matter said Orbis has already drafted an initial pilot plan for the region. However, the proposal faced criticism for being 'highly problematic' due to the company's lack of experience in humanitarian aid distribution, officials added. The talks come amid ongoing efforts to address security and logistical challenges in Gaza.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk2hkkqfjl	2024-11-19T12:59:11-08:00

Trump picks TV's Dr. Oz to run Medicare and Medicaid	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he had chosen celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz to serve as administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Oz, known as 'Dr. Oz', unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 2022. Trump, who endorsed Oz in that race, said he would work closely with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has been nominated to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump said the pair would take on 'the illness industrial complex, and all the horrible chronic diseases left in its wake' as well as cutting what he called waste and fraud. 'Our broken Healthcare System harms everyday Americans, and crushes our Country's budget,' Trump said in a statement.

One drone was intercepted over the Western Galilee, while the others were downed before entering Israeli airspace, according to the IDF.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b111swtqfkg	2024-11-19T12:29:07-08:00	
2 Israelis extracted from Palestinian town after being attacked, ...	Ramla residents violently attacked after entering Dayr Balut in northern West Bank; pair rescued by Palestinian police officers and then extracted by IDF, suffering mild-to-moderate injuries Two Israeli citizens from Ramla were attacked Tuesday evening after entering the Palestinian town of Dayr Balut in the northern West Bank. The pair, reportedly there for business, were assaulted by Palestinians who recognized them as Israeli. Palestinian police intervened, rescuing the Israelis and handing them over to the IDF for extraction. According to the Civil Administration, the Israeli governing body that operates in the West Bank, both sustained mild-to-moderate injuries and are under medical care. Initial reports suggested one was unconscious, but it was later confirmed that both were conscious. The IDF has launched an investigation to confirm the identities of the two Israelis and determine why they entered the town. Palestinian officials allege the incident stemmed from a financial dispute. The military has since locked down Dayr Balut to search for the attackers. In August 2023, a similar incident occurred when an Israeli man accidentally entered a Palestinian village near Ramallah. He was attacked and his car was set on fire, but other Palestinians helped rescue him and ensured his safe transfer to Israeli authorities. Dayr Balut lies within Area A of the West Bank, which is under full Palestinian Authority control and makes up 18% of the territory. The IDF has reiterated warnings against Israelis entering Area A, calling it both prohibited and dangerous.

'Turkey needed to do this,' Erdogan clarified. 'As you know, we completely severed trade ties with Israel. We also did not allow the Israeli president to use our airspace on the way to Baku.

US ambassador-designate to Israel slams White House's 'schizophrenic' policy toward Israel; 'There’s no peace in that region until these terror groups funded by Iran are completely eliminated,' he says U.S. ambassador-designate to Israel Mike Huckabee criticized the Biden administration’s approach to Israel on Tuesday, accusing it of applying more pressure on the Jewish state than on its adversaries. 'We've put far more pressure, with Joe Biden, on Israel than we have on Hamas, Hezbollah and most importantly, the people who write those checks—the Iranians,' Huckabee told Fox News in an interview, describing the White House's policy toward Israel as 'schizophrenic.' He called for increased efforts to secure the release of American hostages held by Hamas, questioning why the administration has not applied greater pressure on the terrorist group and its backers. Huckabee dismissed calls for a cease-fire, saying that one could have been achieved immediately if Hamas ceased its attacks. 'We can have a cease-fire right now. We could have had it on October 8. Hamas lays down its arms, gives up its bombs, bullets, rockets and stops killing Jews, and lets the hostage free,' he said, emphasizing that 'breathing room' for Hamas would only prolong the war. 'They need to be suffocated and ended.' Huckabee called for the complete elimination of terror groups in the region, blaming Iran for their continued operations. 'There’s no peace in that region until these terror groups funded by Iran are completely eliminated,' he concluded.

Lebanese outlets report Avichay Adraee visited Kfarkela and Odaisseh, sparking online debate; one user accuses media of supporting him, another jokes he came to deliver evacuation warnings in person, while commenter insists he never entered IDF Arabic-language spokesman Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee posted on Tuesday a video of himself entering southern Lebanon for a tour of villages near the border, including Kfarkela and Odaisseh, sparking a heated debate among Lebanese citizens and media. Adraee, a well-known figure in the Arab world who frequently clashes with journalists and activists sympathetic to Hezbollah, said he visited 'areas Hezbollah has turned into forward military bases.' He shared a video from the tour, standing near rubble in Odaisseh, and said, 'This house was destroyed because Hezbollah used it as a terror stronghold. This is the state of many buildings in southern Lebanon and beyond. We continue to dismantle Hezbollah’s hideouts.' However, Lebanese social media users cast doubt on Adraee's claims. One user pointed out the lack of local signage in the footage, saying, 'If he really entered, he could have taken a picture next to a village sign.' Another noted smoke rising in the background, suggesting the video was filmed on the Israeli side of the border. Another user wrote: 'Avichay entered Kfarkela and Odaisseh. It seems he intends to deliver the warnings to us in person this time,' referring to evacuation warnings Adraee posts on his social media accounts to Lebanese citizens before Israeli strikes in populated areas. Lebanese media outlets reported widely on Adraee’s statements, with varying interpretations. The outlet Janoubia said Adraee aimed to deliver an 'important and clear message' in front of a destroyed home. The network LBCI cited his claims of a tour in southern Lebanon, while the newspaper An-Nahar referenced his presence in Kfarkela and Odaisseh. Another outlet, Al-Jadeed, wrote, 'Adraee from Kfarkela - Follow.' The extensive Lebanese coverage prompted criticism from some viewers, who accused the media of amplifying Adraee’s message. 'Why are they promoting Adraee? Or is it no surprise?' one user wrote, accusing outlets of inadvertently supporting his narrative.

Would Khamenei’s death bring reform or revolution to Iran?	A new leader, perhaps Khamenei’s son, could bring the illusion of reform or else spark a popular uprising; regime change, though possible, is thought to be unlikely Recent rumors surrounding Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s health have been largely dispelled, but questions persist about what will happen when the 85-year-old leader is no longer in power. The stakes are high. While many speculate on Khamenei’s successor, the broader concern centers on the nature of Iran’s impending political transition. Iranian journalist and analyst Ashkan Safaei Hakimi says there are two main scenarios: In one, a new leader attempts to mend relations with the West, likely creating only the perception of reform, and in another political instability triggers a popular uprising, potentially leading to regime change. Khamenei has served as Iran’s supreme leader for roughly three decades. Though the position is primarily spiritual, it wields immense power, with authority over major issues like foreign policy and the nuclear program. Speculation about Khamenei’s health began with an October 27 New York Times report hinting that his son, Mojtaba Khamenei, might be his successor. Over the weekend, claims surfaced that the supreme leader was in a coma. By Sunday, Iranian state media countered these rumors by publishing a photo of Khamenei meeting with Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani. Dr. Liora Hendelman-Baavur, director of the Alliance Center for Iranian Studies, speculated that the rumors could be an attempt 'to instigate or stir up domestic and internal protests or demonstrations to destabilize the system from the inside.' Widespread opposition to the regime persists in Iran. The Tony Blair Institute (TBI) reported that more than 4,000 street protests have taken place across the country’s provinces over the past two years. 'This is not a flash-in-the-pan moment for Iran but a movement with an unprecedented level of support across all demographics,' wrote Jemima Shelley, a geopolitics analyst for TBI. Rumors about Khamenei’s failing health are not new. In 2006, political analyst Michael Ledeen claimed he was in a coma, with similar reports resurfacing in 2009, 2014, and 2020. In 2014, Khamenei reportedly underwent prostate surgery in Tehran, though only the procedure itself was confirmed. Prostate cancer is a common global illness. Professor Shay Golan, head of the Urologic Oncology Service at Israel’s Beilinson Hospital, noted that millions are diagnosed annually, with approximately 3,000 new cases each year in Israel and 500 deaths. Golan explained that in cases of metastatic, stage IV prostate cancer, severe complications like comas or multi-organ failure can occur. 'But that is at the end of the disease,' Golan said. 'Usually, prostate cancer grows really, really slowly, and today, we can diagnose the disease in its very early stages. If patients get diagnosed in the early stage, 90% of them can be cured of the disease.' Even in later stages, advances in treatment mean patients can 'live for years in good health and good quality of life.' However, Golan emphasized that such outcomes are primarily seen in Western countries. In low- and middle-income nations like Iran, access to advanced treatments is limited, and life expectancy in such cases may be as short as two to three years.

PM says Israeli forces 'relentless in efforts' to bring hostages home; 'Anyone who dares harm our hostages will pay with their life,' he warns and offers $5 million award to anyone who returns a captive Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Tuesday that Hamas’ rule in Gaza is over, as Israeli forces continue their campaign against the terrorist group across the Palestinian enclave. 'Hamas will no longer rule Gaza. We are now targeting their governing capabilities, and our mission is far from over,' Netanyahu said during a visit to the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza alongside Defense Minister Israel Katz, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar. The visit included a briefing from senior military officials and a discussion with reservist brigade commanders about the ongoing military campaign against Hamas. Netanyahu praised the military’s efforts in dismantling Hamas’ capabilities. 'Our forces have achieved remarkable results in eliminating Hamas’ military strength across the Gaza Strip,' he said. The prime minister reiterated Israel’s commitment to securing the release of hostages held by Hamas since the October 7 attack. 'We are relentless in our efforts to bring them home—both the living and the deceased,' he said, warning those responsible for holding the hostages: 'Anyone who dares harm our hostages will pay with their life. We will pursue you, and we will reach you.' Netanyahu also offered an incentive for cooperation, promising a $5 million reward per hostage and safe passage for anyone who aids in their release. 'The choice is yours, but the outcome will be the same: We will bring everyone back,' he said. Acknowledging the sacrifices of Israel's soldiers and their families, Netanyahu commended the resilience and dedication of reservists. 'Our soldiers and commanders are performing exceptional work. I salute our reservists and their families for their unwavering support,' he said. 'The people of Israel stand united behind you.' Katz said the government was 'committed to providing all necessary resources and making decisions that will enable our troops to complete their missions,' and praised the bravery and professionalism of Israeli forces. 'I don’t think there’s an army in the world that can point to achievements of this kind,' he added. Katz underscored that 'the most important mission is to bring the hostages home,' and echoed Netanyahu's statement about defeating Hamas and ensuring the terrorist group 'will not rule here in the future.'

As Donald Trump prepares for return to White House, Shomron Regional Council head holds round of meetings in Congress and hears support from lawmakers advocating for Israel to apply sovereignty to West Bank West Bank settlers are preparing for President-elect Donald Trump's entry into the White House. While the heads of the settlements gathered to formulate an action plan for the president-elect's new term in office, the head of the Shomron Regional Council, Yossi Dagan, left for a visit to the United States that included meetings with senior Republicans and members of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington. The meetings were, of course, mainly concerned with the hope of applying Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank, also known as Judea and Samaria. Republican House of Representatives lawmaker Claudia Tenney of New York is an ally of Dagan. 'I am a partner in the legal initiative that will guarantee the rights of Samaria and Judea and make sure that they will be recognized and not called 'the West Bank' when talking about products and other things produced in this area. I am a strong supporter of Israel. We are very excited to cooperate with you, and we will be happy to return to Samaria in the future,' she said. Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska did not address the issue directly, but expressed his support for Israel. 'After the terrible attack on October 7 and what Israel had to do to defend itself, I look forward to defending your sovereignty and your security in this new administration you will find an administration that's got friendship for Israel as opposed to what happened in the past administration.' According to Maryland Rep. Andy Harris: 'When all is said and done, the two-state solution just doesn't work. It's got to be a one-state solution, with obviously Judea and Samaria in part of the State of Israel. That's the way it has to be. This is the only solution that will ensure sustainable peace.' Dagan also met with the chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy, U.S. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, and Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, who said that it is important to maintain the 'excellent relations' between the two countries. 'The relationship between the U.S. and Israel, with an emphasis on stopping the harassment and obsessive persecution against the Jewish settlement in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria,' said Dagan. 'We presented to the members of Congress with our request and demand that the U.S. government either support or not oppose and thwart sovereignty over the Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria. We have partners here who have promised to be involved in this matter,' Dagan said. 'Even if the U.S. administration cannot say that it is in favor of it, and even has to say that it is opposed, it will not fight the way the Biden administration would have fought.' He also called on the prime minister and government ministers to act. 'The ball is in your court. You can apply sovereignty immediately upon the entry of the Trump administration,' he said.

Hamas attack on Israel stirs controversy among Gaza clerics	Well-known Palestinian cleric questions harm caused by Oct. 7 attack, including high civilian death toll, while local group of religious leaders asserts Hamas assault legitimate The Hamas attack on Israel that triggered the Gaza war has stirred debate among the enclave's Palestinian clerics, with some saying it was not worth the heavy civilian death toll and others declaring the October 7, 2023 assault was a Muslim duty. Some 1,200 Israelis were killed on that day, and some 251 people were taken hostage into Gaza, of which 101 hostages, both dead alive, are still held captive. It was the country's bloodiest day in its history. Israel responded with a destructive offensive in Gaza. Responding to questions sent by Gazans on an online messaging platform, prominent preacher Suleiman Al-Dayya said Muslim leaders should avoid going into battles if the harm inflicted upon civilians is greater than the gains. He said warriors should question the wisdom of fighting if it increases the harm to religion, life, honor, children or wealth or the seizure of land, let alone the destruction of the 'foundations of life.' Dayya's views are well respected in Gaza among both ordinary residents and Islamists, and he also has influence with Palestinians in the West Bank. A former senior member of the Muslim Brotherhood, the oldest Islamist movement in the Arab world, he was also close to Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, co-founder and leader of the Palestinian terror group Hamas, before pursuing a more moderate form of Islam. 'When it becomes highly likely that the objectives and aims of jihad will not be achieved due to the absence or deficiency of its pillars, causes or conditions, it must be avoided,' said Dayya. Late on Monday, a statement issued in the name of 'a group of clerics' in Gaza defended the assault as a 'legitimate act and a fulfillment of the duty of jihad, with no doubt about its legitimacy.' 'However, was the timing of the decision a mistake in judgment, as it led to this destructive war afterward, or was it appropriate due to specific circumstances known to the fighters, for example? This is a matter open to consideration,' the statement said. 'But such consideration and placing of blame are not appropriate during the war; they should come afterward, as it serves no purpose now and rather harms,' it added. In their statement, the clerics' group said they appreciated Dayya's opinion and religious status but they cautioned his verdict could be misunderstood and could affect the spirit of ordinary Palestinians as well as fighters. Some Gazans are also questioning the wisdom of Hamas staging an attack that led to Israel's relentless bombardment of Gaza, which was already struggling with widespread poverty and high unemployment before the war erupted. For Israelis and their Western allies, Hamas is a terrorist group that has fired missiles at them and staged suicide bombings. Hamas' supporters regard its fighters as heroes leading the fight for Palestinian statehood, which had drifted off the international agenda. Israel, which has assassinated several top Hamas leaders, has vowed to destroy the group.

Iran has offered not to expand its stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% purity, near the roughly 90% of weapons grade, and made preparations to do that, the U.N. nuclear watchdog said in confidential reports to member states on Tuesday. The offer is conditional, however, on Western powers abandoning their push for a resolution against Iran at this week's meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency's 35-nation Board of Governors over its lack of cooperation with the IAEA, diplomats said, adding that the push was continuing. During IAEA chief Rafael Grossi's trip to Iran last week, 'the possibility of Iran not further expanding its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% U-235 was discussed', read one of the two confidential quarterly IAEA reports, both seen by Reuters.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy4szsqf1g	2024-11-19T07:50:04-08:00	
US imposes sanctions on senior Hamas officials	The U.S. on Tuesday imposed sanctions on six senior Hamas officials, the U.S. Treasury Department said, in further action against the Palestinian militant group as Washington has sought to achieve a ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza.

'Hamas continues to rely on key officials who seemingly maintain legitimate, public-facing roles within the group, yet who facilitate their terrorist activities, represent their interests abroad, and coordinate the transfer of money and goods into Gaza,' Treasury's Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Bradley Smith, said in the statement. 'Treasury remains committed to disrupting Hamas' efforts to secure additional revenue and holding those who facilitate the group's terrorist activities to account.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1iobs5mjl	2024-11-19T07:49:28-08:00	
Water is more precious than gold here': Turkey's strikes on Syri...	Report sheds light on dire consequences of Ankara's bombing campaign against Kurdish forces in Syria, leaving residents relying on water deliveries; Kurdish leaders accuse Turkey of attempted 'genocide' while legal experts suggest strikes may constitute war crime Turkey’s extensive airstrikes on Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria have disrupted the water supply to over a million residents in the region, a BBC investigation published Tuesday revealed. Experts cited in the report suggested the attacks may constitute a violation of international law. For years, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has led bombing campaigns and ground invasions across the border targeting Kurdish forces, which Ankara accuses of ties to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The PKK, which seeks Kurdish autonomy in Turkey, is classified as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S., the European Union and the UK. The Kurdish YPG militia, a key component of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that governs this area—informally known as 'Syrian Kurdistan'—helped defeat ISIS during the last decade. However, Erdogan has consistently labeled the YPG as an extension of the PKK. The recent escalation follows a PKK-claimed attack on a military facility in Ankara last month. In retaliation, Turkey launched a wide-scale bombing campaign against Kurdish targets in Syria, though the YPG denied any involvement in the attack. According to the BBC investigation, accompanied by a full-length documentary, Turkey has conducted over 100 attacks on Kurdish-controlled northeastern Syria between October 2019 and January 2024. These strikes targeted oil and gas facilities and power stations vital to civilians in the region. According to the report, the attacks have worsened an already dire humanitarian situation, exacerbated by years of brutal civil war and four years of extreme drought linked to climate change. The crisis escalated further in October 2023, when Turkish strikes on power infrastructure cut electricity to the region’s primary water station, rendering it inoperable. The BBC team visited the region twice and reported that residents in Hasakah province, home to around one million people, are now relying on water deliveries from sources 12 miles (20 kilometers) away. Hundreds of water tankers are dispatched daily, but supply shortages force authorities to prioritize hospitals, schools and orphanages, leaving many residents without access. During one visit to Hasakah, BBC reporters observed residents queuing desperately for water and pleading with tanker drivers for supplies. 'Water is more precious than gold here,' said Ahmed al-Ahmed, a water tanker driver. 'People need more water. All they want is for you to give them water.' The report described fighting breaking out among residents waiting in line, with one woman threatening to puncture a tanker’s tires if it didn’t deliver water to her. Yahya Ahmed, co-director of the city water board, described the situation as a 'humanitarian catastrophe.' The autonomous Kurdish administration in northeastern Syria has accused Turkey of attempting to 'destroy our people’s existence' in the region. Following a new wave of Turkish airstrikes last month, Kurdish officials claimed that Ankara targeted not only military positions but also civilian infrastructure, such as power stations. 'The main goal is to weaken the Kurdish autonomous administration and force the population to flee,' said SDF Commander Mazloum Abdi. In an interview with AFP, Abdi also accused Turkey of exploiting the global focus on the wars in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as tensions with Iran, to escalate attacks against the Kurds. Abdi criticized the U.S.-led coalition, calling its response to the strikes 'weak' and insufficient to halt the assaults. 'Pressure must be applied on Turkey,' he said. The Kurds remain a key partner in the U.S.-led coalition, which maintains around 900 American troops in Syria to combat jihadist terrorist groups. In a statement to the BBC, Turkey claimed its airstrikes target the 'sources of income and capabilities' of Kurdish separatist groups it regards as terrorists. The Turkish government denied hitting civilian infrastructure and blamed the worsening humanitarian crisis in northeastern Syria on climate change, as well as poor water management by local Kurdish authorities and neglected infrastructure. Turkey also insisted it 'fully respects international law' and said that 'Civilians or civilian infrastructure were not among our targets and have never been' a target. However, the BBC highlighted a 2022 remark by Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who said that any 'infrastructure, superstructure and energy facilities' used by the PKK or YPG in Syria and Iraq are 'legitimate targets' for Ankara. In February, the UN accused Turkey of potentially committing a war crime during its October 2023 strikes on Kurdish power infrastructure, which disrupted access to water for civilians. Legal experts familiar with the BBC investigation echoed these concerns. '[T]he indications that international law was violated here are so strong that they should be investigated by a prosecutorial authority,' said Patrick Kroker, an international criminal law expert.

IDF reservist killed by Hezbollah drone strike in southern Lebano...	Sergeant First Class (res.) Omer Moshe Gaeldor, 30, soldier from Golani Brigade's 5111th Reconnaissance Battalion, from Jerusalem, killed during operational approximately 2 kilometers from border; 3 other soldiers seriously wounded in attack The IDF reported that Sergeant First Class (res.) Omer Moshe Gaeldor, 30, a soldier from the Golani Brigade's 5111th Reconnaissance Battalion, from Jerusalem, was killed Tuesday morning when a Hezbollah explosive drone struck an IDF unit operating in southern Lebanon. Gaeldor is survived by his wife, Adi, and their two young children, 3-year-old Neta and 8-month-old Aluma. Three other soldiers were seriously wounded in the attack and were airlifted to an Israeli hospital. Their families have been notified. The strike occurred approximately two kilometers from the border while the troops were securing operations deeper into southern Lebanon. The IDF said that Hezbollah has intensified its efforts to target Israeli forces in southern Lebanon with rockets, mortars and drones. The military is working to provide early warnings, intercept threats and disrupt such attacks. Gaeldor, formerly a resident of Neve Tzuf in the West Bank, was eulogized by Benjamin Regional Council head Yisrael Ganz. 'Today, we bear a heavy price and mourn the loss of a hero who gave his life to protect the people of Israel. The state will continue to strike its enemies until full victory is achieved. We embrace his wife, Adi, and the entire family,' Ganz said. In Gaza, the military reported Sunday the deaths of Capt. Yogev Pazy, 22, a platoon commander in the Kfir Brigade’s 90th Battalion, from Giv’ot Bar, and Staff Sgt. Noam Eitan, 21, a fighter in the same battalion, from Hadera. The soldiers were killed during a clash with terrorists in Jabaliya, northern Gaza. Another soldier was seriously injured, and his family has been notified. Pazy was the nephew of Knesset member Gadi Eisenkot, whose family has also suffered additional losses in the war, including his son, Master Sgt. (res.) Gal Meir Eisenkot, and nephew, Sgt. Maor Cohen Eisenkot. 'The heart aches for these two heroes who fell in Gaza today,' said National Unity Party leader Benny Gantz. 'Our thoughts are with Hanan, Gadi and the Pazy family during this painful time.'

Lavrov said he hoped Moscow's new nuclear doctrine, in which President Vladimir Putin lowered the threshold for a nuclear strike, would be attentively read.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1z7cmqm1g	2024-11-19T05:01:34-08:00	
Response is inevitable': Putin alters Russia's nuclear doctrine ...	Ukraine launches attack into Russian territory with Western-made weapons following U.S. approval, pushing the Kremlin to consider nuclear option against fellow nuclear states Russian President Vladimir Putin has officially approved changes to his country’s nuclear doctrine, the Kremlin announced on Tuesday. Under the revised framework, Moscow now threatens a potential nuclear response even to a conventional attack against Russia – if such an attack is carried out with the 'aid' of another nuclear power. This is widely interpreted as a clear warning to Western nations arming and supporting Ukraine. The Kremlin's announcement coincides with Kyiv marking 1,000 days since Russia's invasion on February 24, 2022. It's viewed as a response to U.S. President Joe Biden’s recent approval, allowing Ukraine to use American long-range missiles for strikes deep into Russian territory. Over recent months, Putin has repeatedly threatened a severe response should Biden grant such permission. In September, he warned that it would alter the scale and nature of the war in Ukraine, signaling direct involvement by NATO, the U.S. and Europe, since NATO personnel and infrastructure would necessarily be involved in guiding and launching such attacks. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that the updated nuclear doctrine aims to ensure 'potential enemies' understand that Russia’s response to any attack on itself or its allies would be 'inevitable.' He stressed that any assault by a non-nuclear state on Russia, conducted in cooperation with a nuclear state, would be considered a joint attack by both nations. 'This is a very important point,' he said during a press conference. Peskov further argued that expanding the scenarios for potential nuclear use was 'essential' given the 'current state of affairs.' However, he didn’t directly respond when asked whether this was a direct reaction to the U.S. decision to allow Kyiv to target Russian territory with U.S. weaponry — a move Ukraine had long advocated for, claiming it was fighting 'with one hand tied behind its back' without such approval. Peskov also reiterated that Moscow 'always' sought to reduce nuclear threats, considering them an 'extreme' measure meant solely for deterrence. Nonetheless, the updated nuclear doctrine effectively broadens the Kremlin’s conditions for launching a nuclear strike, providing more detailed scenarios compared to the previous framework. According to the changes, which were advanced in the weeks leading up to the U.S. elections but only now formalized, Russia could respond with a nuclear attack to a conventional assault on its territory if it involves aid from a nuclear-armed state. The new doctrine also outlines the possibility of using nuclear weapons in the event of a 'massive air strike' involving ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, fighter jets, drones and other aerial munitions. Any aggression against Russia by a nation that’s part of a coalition – presumably NATO – would now be treated as aggression by the entire coalition. The new doctrine also allows for consideration of a nuclear response to aggression against Russia’s ally, Belarus. The UK condemned Putin’s decision shortly after its announcement, saying the president’s move was the 'latest example of irresponsibility from a depraved Russian government,' according to a spokesperson for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. When asked about the new nuclear threat posed by Russia, Starmer told the BBC that: 'We remain steadfast in our support for Ukraine.' Meanwhile, Russia has begun serial production of mobile bomb shelters that can protect against a variety of threats including shockwaves and radiation from a nuclear blast. The emergency ministry's research institute said the 'KUB-M' shelter could offer protection for 48 hours against these and other natural and man-made hazards. Among those it listed were: explosions and shrapnel from conventional weapons; falling debris from buildings; dangerous chemicals; and fires. The 'KUB-M' looks like a reinforced shipping container and consists of two modules - a room for 54 people and a technical block. More modules can be added if needed, the institute said. It did not link the move to any current crisis, though the announcement came days after the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden agreed to allow Ukraine to fire U.S. long-range missiles deep into Russia - a decision that the Kremlin said was reckless and would draw a response from Moscow. 'The mobile shelter is a multifunctional structure that provides protection for people from various threats, including natural disasters and man-made accidents,' the research institute said, calling it 'an important step towards improving the safety of citizens'. It can easily be transported on a truck and connected to water supplies, and can also be deployed in Russia's vast northern permafrost, it added.

Hochstein says there is a real opportunity for cease-fire	U.S. envoy speaks to reporters after meeting Lebanese speaker of parliament who represent Hezbollah in talks to end the war; says decisions must now be made U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein said on Tuesday that he had held 'very constructive talks' with the speaker of Lebanon's parliament in Beirut and that there was a 'real opportunity' to bring the conflict between the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah and Israel to an end. Hochstein arrived in Beirut earlier for talks with Berri who represents Hezbollah in the negotiations and with Lebanese care-taker prime minister Najib Mukati. 'This is a moment of decision-making. I am here in Beirut to facilitate that decision but it's ultimately the decision of the parties to reach a conclusion to this conflict. It is now within our grasp,' he told reporters after the meeting. While Hochstein was visiting, Hezbollah launched a missile at the center of Israel, wounding five people as rocket fire to the north continued all morning. The Hezbollah-affiliated al Akhbar newspaper said in a report on Tuesday that Hochstein's visit is the final attempt to reach a deal, but obstacles remain. According to the paper the two issued that must be resolved are Israel's 'self -defense' and the make-up of the international commission that will oversea compliance with the terms of the agreement. Lebanon says self-defense is already recognized under international law and therefore does not have to be a part of the cease-fire deal and that Israel's insistence to include it is an attempt to legitimize any future military action it would take. Lebanon therefore rejects it. Beirut also opposes the participation of the UK and Germany in the international commission overseeing compliance of the agreement, but sources told the publication that that matter could be more easily resolved. Saudi Arabia's Al Hadath channel in its report on Tuesday, quoted sources who said the U.S. wanted Lebanese agreement to American supervision of the Beirut International Airport and the sea ports as well as its supervision of the borders to prevent the influx of arms for Hezbollah arriving from Syria. According to the channel Hochstein was negotiation an agreement that would encompass all of Lebanon and not only the south.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1d5px5fjx	2024-11-19T02:45:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/19/Syd0mxczJl/Syd0mxczJl_0_152_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Lebanese paper says Strategic Affairs Minister raises possible lifting of sanctions from Russian and Syrian companies after meetings in Moscow Israel proposed that some U.S. sanctions should be lifted from Syrian President Bashar Assad in exchange for his involvement in preventing the flow of arms to Hezbollah across the Syrian border with Lebanon, the Lebanese daily Al Jounhouria reported on Tuesday. According to the paper, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer raised the possibility of sanction relief to ensure Russian involvement in the effort to block the smuggling of arms from Syrian territory into neighboring Lebanon and block what has been termed the 'Iranian highway,' connecting the Dahieh in Beirut to Iran via Syria and Iraq. Dermer committed to request the Biden administration to freeze sanctions on Assad as well as Russian and Syrian companies. The idea was discussed during the first Trump term and may have come up now after his reelection. Dermer was in Moscow earlier in the month on a secret visit to try and promote the matter. Israeli officials said there was an understanding that Russia can influence Hezbollah, Syria and Iran and that Moscow was hoping for a cease-fire in the war in Lebanon. The Wall Street Journal reported in an article on Tuesday that Russian-made weapons were found in by troops in Hezbollah's weapons stores in South Lebanon and that new, even recently produced weapons made in Russia were transferred through Syria recently and replace old Soviet-era armaments.

Russian-made weapons found in Hezbollah arsenal, report	Anti-tank missiles produced as recently as 2020, among stocks found by troops in South Lebanon delivered via Syria, raising concerns of deepening Moscow-Tehran cooperation; 70% of seized Hezbollah weapons are Russian made The IDF found Russian-made weapons in Hezbollah stores in South Lebanon, the Wall Street Journal said on Tuesday. Among the weapons made in Russia were anti-tank missiles sent in recent years to Lebanon via Syria which had been receiving Russian weapons for years. Israel had not been able to confirm the flow of Russian-made weapons to the Iran-backed terror group until its forces were on the ground in South Lebanon, the journal said. According to the outlet, citing a Syrian security official, some of the munitions, including anti-tank missiles manufactured as recently as 2020, were sent to the country from Russian stocks located in Syria. The news contradicts earlier Israeli assessment that the terror group only used Soviet era weapons from the 2006 Second Lebanon War in 2006. The discoveries also increased fears in Israel, according to the Wall Street Journal, that Moscow was deepening relations with the Iran-backed group despite its insistence on neutrality in the conflict. 'Israel needs to be more assertive and defend its interests,' Arkady Mil-Man, a former Israeli ambassador to Russia, told the outlet. 'We must explain and convey to the Russians that we will no longer stand any assistance to Hezbollah and Iran that could hurt Israelis,' Mil-Man, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv, said. Both the Russian government and the Syrian foreign ministry refused to comment on the inquiry made by the Wall Street Journal. Russia's focus on the Middle East According to the article, Russia's stance in the Middle East has shifted since the start of the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, despite Israel’s efforts to maintain friendly relations with Moscow, so as to avoid conflicts in Syria, where Russia has a strong military presence. Analysts told the outlet that Russia was now actively seeking to harass the U.S. and its allies wherever possible. The report also detailed how the Russians provided aid in the form of munitions and military intelligence to Yemen’s Houthis, who have taken an active part in attacking Israel since the outset of the Gaza war on October 7. Moscow has also allegedly delivered anti-air defense systems to Hezbollah, thoughthere was no confirmation of the transaction, according to the Wall Street Journal. The WSJ detailed Russia’s warming relations with Hamas since the start of the war, hosting its political leaders several times in Moscow while seeking to reconcile the terror group and Fatah. Russia’s growing support comes against the backdrop of its deepening relations with Iran, who delivered the same drones and ballistic missiles to Moscow as it did to its proxy Hezbollah. According to a report, Russia's involvement in Syria has had a ripple effect on the region’s military dynamics, particularly concerning Hezbollah's access to advanced weaponry. Russia deepened its ties with Syria following the outbreak of Syria’s civil war in 2011, intervening militarily to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The outlet reported that Russia not only provided weapons to Syria but also maintained its own stockpiles in the country. Around 2015, Russian forces began collaborating with Hezbollah fighters on the ground, strengthening ties between the two groups. Russian weapons make 70% of seized arms in Lebanon ground operation According to Syrian security officials and an Arab official cited in the report, this relationship facilitated Hezbollah's access to Russian arms in Syria, including advanced weapon systems like antitank, antiaircraft and anti-ship missiles. The frequency with which Hezbollah obtained Russian weapons remains unclear, according to the Wall Street Journal. Traditionally, much of Hezbollah's arsenal has come from its patron Iran. However, Israeli officials have reportedly found a significant number of Russian-made weapons in southern Lebanon during recent operations. The outlet detailed a visit to Israel's National Munition Disassembly Lab, where seized materials from southern Lebanon are analyzed. The lab revealed an array of Russian weaponry, including Kornet and other guided antitank missile systems like Metis, Konkurs, Fagots and Saggers. These weapons were discovered in Hezbollah bunkers both above and below ground, less than a kilometer inside southern Lebanon an Israeli major told the Wall Street Journal. According to the Israeli officer, Russian-made arms comprised 60-70% of the weapons seized in the early days of Israel’s recent invasion of southern Lebanon. IDF Reservists reportedly continue to encounter Russian weapons in the area. From Moscow to Lebanon via Syria While the exact methods by which Hezbollah acquired these arms remain uncertain, some of the captured weapons bore markings linking them to Russia’s shipments to Syria’s defense ministry. The outlet reported that markings on some weapons, such as the Kornet, confirmed their Russian origin rather than being Iranian copies. One set of rockets even had labels in Russian indicating shipment to Syria. However, not all seized weapons carried such identifiers. The timeline for these deliveries is unclear, but the report noted that some weapons were manufactured as recently as 2020, while others, like the Saggers, date back to the 1980s. Fabian Hinz, a military research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, highlighted the importance of reliable, short-range missiles like the Kornet to Hezbollah’s operations. According to the Wall Street Journal, Hinz said these weapons have enabled Hezbollah to carry out a more efficient campaign against Israel compared to Hamas, which primarily relies on less reliable Iranian-made versions. Adam Rousselle, a researcher at Militant Wire, noted that the Kornet and two other Russian-made antitank missiles seized by IDF forces have featured prominently in Hezbollah attack videos since October 7, 2023 and have played a significant role in Hezbollah’s military tactics. An Israeli staff sergeant involved in medical evacuations in Lebanon described anti-tank missiles, including Kornets, as the most effective tools for targeting IDF soldiers and noted that these missiles can strike from a range of 7–8 kilometers (4.3–5 miles). While Hezbollah has suffered setbacks from IDF military actions, the sergeant stressed its strength relative to Hamas, largely due to its advanced arsenal. The Wall Street Journal reported that the IDF has displayed weapons seized from Hezbollah during ongoing combat operations in Lebanon. Israeli officials have pointed to two key objectives of their operations: neutralizing the threat posed by anti-tank missiles near Israeli communities and forcing Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force back north of the Litani River. The report also noted growing concerns among analysts and officials regarding Israel's diplomatic approach toward Russia. While many Western nations have provided military aid to Ukraine in its war against Moscow, Israel has limited its support to non-military aid, a stance believed to be influenced by its desire to avoid provoking Moscow. Carmit Valensi, a senior researcher at the INSS, criticized this approach. 'We need to sober up from this approach. It’s no longer just Russian support for the axis of resistance that is unconnected to Israel. We are meeting this in the battlefield and it is extracting casualties,' she said.

Hamas enforces rule by punishing aid theft in Gaza	The terror group claims to have executed at least 20 thieves who looted aid trucks, leading Gazans to hope prices of basic goods will drop as a result Gaza-based terror group Hamas announced on Monday it had carried out a 'successful elimination operation' against 20 looters who have allegedly taken over humanitarian aid in the enclave and claimed they were the ones who oversaw prices of stock being sold to remaining markets in the Strip. The report comes against the backdrop of efforts to prevent the group from taking over aid being delivered to Gaza and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s directive asking the IDF to 'make plans to diminish Hamas’ political and governing capabilities.' 'A 25-kilogram (55-pound) sack of flour, which feeds one family for a day, costs 400 shekels ($100). The situation has become unbearably dire,' A Gazan staying in one of Khan Younis’ camps said. 'Thieves began stealing massive amounts of goods and aid, driving up prices.' 'This group of criminals had been sentenced to death but escaped Hamas prisons after the war. However, Hamas managed to regain control and eliminate them in one swift operation. We're relieved that we'll finally receive food and water,' he added. Sources within Gaza's Hamas-controlled Interior Ministry claimed that over 20 gang members involved in thefts of aid trucks were killed during a 'high-quality security operation' carried out by the terror organization's security services in collaboration with tribal committees east of Rafah. As part of Hamas' efforts to solidify its rule in the Strip after over 13 months of fighting and heavy losses, sources told Hamas' Al-Aqsa channel that 'the operation marks the beginning of an extensive and carefully planned security campaign that will continue to target all involved in the theft of aid trucks, which significantly impacted civilians' lives and led to hunger in southern Gaza.' Hamas’ Interior Ministry said that the operation wasn’t aimed at specific tribes but asked to eliminate the phenomenon of truck looting. On Sunday, the 'popular committees,' a body established by Hamas to 'protect' aid, announced the execution of four thieves. 'The field executions are part of an integrated plan to address the crimes of aid truck robberies,' the ministry said. 'We will continue to pursue lawbreakers and thieves who steal the food of the Palestinian people.' Meanwhile, the German government announced on Monday of €6 million ($6.5 million) in financial aid to enhance the UN mechanism for expediting humanitarian aid delivery to Gaza. The funds will be delivered under an agreement with the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS), tasked with overseeing secure aid distribution. The financial aid is part of Germany's humanitarian commitment to support international efforts to address Gaza's worsening crisis, in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2720 (2023), aimed at improving aid distribution through UN-monitored humanitarian corridors. Despite reports of Hamas stealing and reselling aid at inflated prices, displaced Gazans are now anticipating price reductions that will enable them to purchase basic goods. Estimates suggest that about 500 thieves, operating in gangs, have been stealing aid since the war began. Senior Israeli officials have instructed the security bodies to intensify actions against aid looters in Gaza, asking to ensure that aid doesn’t fall into the hands of hostile elements like criminal syndicates and Hamas terrorists. Ynet learned that approximately 15 aid trucks were looted on Monday in the area by armed individuals. The IDF responded by opening fire at others attempting to loot additional trucks, foiling their efforts. While no official government directive has been made regarding the aid distribution, the IDF and the security officials have recently taken measures to tighten control over its delivery. According to security officials, certain points and junctions have become hotspots where looters attack and rob the trucks. Some Hamas terrorists have also managed to seize portions of the aid.

Shin Bet Chief's secret visit to Turkey amid Hamas developments	Ronen Bar's visit highlights geopolitical tensions as Qatar reportedly expels senior Hamas officials to Turkey; Israeli official says Turkey will get involved in hostage deals, leaving Egypt as the sole mediator following Qatar's announcement it was stepping back Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar recently made a clandestine visit to Turkey, meeting with Ibrahim Kalin, head of Turkish intelligence agency Millî İstihbarat Teşkilatı (MIT). This meeting occurred amid reports that Qatar expelled senior Hamas leaders who subsequently arrived in Turkey. An Israeli official clarified that Turkey will not serve as a mediator in any hostage negotiations. Instead, their role might involve exerting pressure on Hamas, with Egypt emerging as the primary mediator following Qatar's announcement. Earlier, a Turkish diplomatic source refuted claims that Hamas had relocated its political offices to Turkey, stating that members of the organization were merely visiting. 'Members of Hamas' political branch visit Turkey from time to time. Claims that Hamas moved its offices to Turkey do not reflect reality,' the source asserted. Bar's secret visit followed the cancellation of Israeli President Isaac Herzog's planned trip to the climate conference in Baku, partially attributed to Turkey's refusal to allow Herzog's plane to fly through its airspace en route to Azerbaijan. Local Azerbaijani media initially reported on this, feeling slighted by Israel's announcement citing 'security considerations' for the cancellation. Azerbaijani sources confirmed this to Ynet, and Israel acknowledged Turkey's refusal as a factor, though not the sole or primary reason for the cancellation. Herzog was scheduled for a brief visit to Baku on Tuesday, with plans to use the 'Wing of Zion' aircraft, designated for official overseas visits by the Prime Minister and President. A statement from the President's residence mentioned, 'Due to a situational assessment and for security reasons, the President has decided to cancel his trip to the climate conference in Azerbaijan.' Israeli sources noted security alerts; however, Jerusalem clarified that at no point was there a claim of a security issue within Azerbaijan itself. The Azerbaijani response to Israel's announcement was less than favorable. A senior source in Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry informed the 'Caliber' website that the reason for Herzog's visit cancellation was unrelated to security but was instead due to Turkey's prohibition of the use of its airspace by Herzog's aircraft. 'Unfortunately, intensive negotiations through diplomatic channels over several days did not yield results. Azerbaijan provides an overall concept for holding the conference and creates conditions for the participation of all parties. However, the situation regarding the Israeli president's visit arose for reasons beyond our country's control,' the source added.

Hezbollah fires missiles at central Israel as Hochstein arrives i...	IDF says at least 5 projectiles launched some intercepted; Lebanon opposes IDF freedom to operate on its territory, opposes participation of UK, Germany in international commission overseeing compliance of the deal, Hezbollah-affiliated publication says Hezbollah fire targeted central Israel's Sharon Plains on Tuesday after a missile launched at the greater Tel Aviv area on Monday, causing damage and some injuries. U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut on Tuesday to advance negotiations for a cease-fire to end the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Hochstein is expected to receive Lebanon's final response to the proposed deal and deliver it to Israel. The Hezbollah-affiliated al Akhbar newspaper said in a report on Tuesday that Hochstein's visit is the final attempt to reach a deal, but obstacles remain. According to the paper the two issued that must be resolved are Israel's 'self -defense' and the make-up of the international commission that will oversea compliance with the terms of the agreement. Lebanon says self-defense is already recognized under international law and therefore does not have to be a part of the cease-fire deal and that Israel's insistence to include it is an attempt to legitimize any future military action it would take. Lebanon therefore rejects it. Beirut also opposes the participation of the UK and Germany in the international commission overseeing compliance of the agreement, but sources told the publication that that matter could be more easily resolved. Saudi Arabia's Al Hadath channel in its report on Tuesday, quoted sources who said the U.S. wanted Lebanese agreement to American supervision of the Beirut International Airport and the sea ports as well as its supervision of the borders to prevent the influx of arms for Hezbollah arriving from Syria. According to the channel Hochstein was negotiation an agreement that would encompass all of Lebanon and not only the south. The success of the negotiations would open the way to a final drawing of the international border between Israel and Lebanon. But the envoy's success is not guaranteed, Al Hadath said. Nabih Berry, Lebanon's speaker of parliament who was negotiation on the part of Hezbollah wanted to pressure the Iran-backed terror group to agree to American's proposed terms.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjpovnfzje	2024-11-18T22:03:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/19/rJf7vnYGke/rJf7vnYGke_0_0_640_533_0_small.jpg

Among the weapons made in Russia were anti-tank missiles sent in recent years to Lebanon via Syria that had been receiving Russian weapons for years. Israel had not been able to confirm the flow of Russian-made weapons to the Iran-backed terror group until its forces were on the ground in South Lebanon, the journal said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyyusjfgjx	2024-11-18T21:11:10-08:00	
Would the Iranian regime collapse if Khamenei dies?	Prof. Shai Golan: Advanced prostate cancer can lead to severe complications like coma and multi-organ failure Iran has released a photo of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei amid widespread rumors on social media claiming he is either in a coma or has died. The image shows Khamenei in his office speaking with Iran’s Ambassador to Lebanon, who was injured in Beirut during Israel’s September strikes on Hezbollah. Speculation about Khamenei’s health began with an October 27 New York Times report suggesting he was 'seriously ill' and that his son might succeed him. On Saturday, claims surfaced that the 85-year-old had fallen into a coma. Experts have cast doubt on these reports, suggesting they could be true or false. Khamenei’s health has been under scrutiny for two decades, with recurring rumors of illness and potential succession. Officials consistently deny such claims, often releasing photos to refute them. A similar pattern occurred last night with the ambassador’s meeting. Rumors date back to 2006 when political analyst Michael Ledeen claimed Khamenei was in a coma. Similar reports emerged in 2009 and 2014, when Khamenei underwent prostate surgery believed to be for cancer. Speculation resurfaced in 2020. Prof. Shai Golan of Beilinson Hospital told ILTV News that advanced prostate cancer can lead to severe complications like coma and multi-organ failure. However, prostate cancer typically grows slowly and has a 90% cure rate with early detection. Iran’s healthcare challenges, however, could shorten survival to two or three years if Khamenei has advanced cancer—though this remains unconfirmed. Khamenei cannot unilaterally name his successor. The Assembly of Experts, comprising 88 Shia clerics, must elect the next Supreme Leader. Would the regime collapse if Khamenei dies? Iranian journalist Ashkan Hakimi outlined two theories: a new leader could seek better relations with the West, or public unrest could lead to regime change. For now, these scenarios remain speculative until Khamenei’s health status is clarified.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry8crjymkl	2024-11-18T20:50:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/27/By2x9til1e/By2x9til1e_0_35_2295_1292_0_small.jpg

Doctors warn: Hostages at severe risk of life-threatening illness...	Report says need for immediate humanitarian intervention As Israel's hostages endure over 400 days in captivity, medical experts are raising urgent alarms about their heightened vulnerability to severe illnesses and diseases, particularly with winter fast approaching. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has issued a humanitarian report detailing the dire health conditions many captives are likely facing. According to the report, some hostages have lost up to 50% of their body weight, significantly compromising their immune systems. This leaves them at increased risk of contracting diseases, as well as facing potential complications such as frostbite, hypothermia, cardiovascular conditions, and respiratory infections in the coming months. The report underscores the pressing need for immediate humanitarian intervention to address these life-threatening risks.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1yyiktg1g	2024-11-18T18:51:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/07/ryATF11Wk1x/ryATF11Wk1x_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
‘Israel should control Gaza for at least two or three years’	Yoni Ben Menachem: More security forces are needed to find the hostages, not a ceasefire deal Israel should control Gaza for at least two or three years to eradicate Hamas from the area, according to Yoni Ben Menachem of the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs. Speaking to ILTV News, Ben Menachem said that only if Israel takes over Gaza and 'works freely' could it kill all the terrorists, dismantle Hamas’s military infrastructure and destroy the tunnels. 'This is a long process,' Ben Menachem said. 'We cannot do it now without the full control in Gaza and also controlling the civilians.' As such, he said it is premature to sign any ceasefire agreement with Hamas, which he anyway does not believe will bring Israel’s hostages home. On Monday, G20 leaders, the leaders of the world’s biggest economies, called for 'comprehensive' ceasefires in both Gaza and Lebanon in a joint statement at a summit in Brazil. But Ben Menachem said that Hamas has no intention of signing a deal and that Israel has not done enough militarily to bring the hostages back. 'The IDF did not apply enough pressure, military pressure, in Gaza in order to find the hostages, and they did not make enough intelligence effort to locate the hostages,' he told ILTV. 'What is needed is to bring more forces into Gaza and intensify the intelligence gathering in order to get to the hostages.' He said Hamas would continue to blame Israel for not signing a deal, but if ultimately something was signed, he does not believe the hostages would come home anyway. 'This is why we have to do it ourselves,' he said.

British commander Richard Kemp: Talk of ceasefire with Hezbollah ...	Kemp says 'the handcuffs are going to be taken off Israel' under US President Donald Trump It is 'premature' for Israel to sign a ceasefire deal with Lebanon, according to British commander Richard Kemp. He told ILTV News last week that the ceasefire efforts are being driven by the Biden administration, which wants to see some conclusion to the war before U.S. President Joe Biden leaves office. However, he said that Israel's work against the terror organization Hezbollah is not done. 'Israel needs to do much more damage to Hezbollah, and it effectively needs to create a situation where Hezbollah becomes demilitarized as a longer-term objective, and that there is a very significant buffer zone between the Israeli border and the southern part of Lebanon, to the extent that there is no longer a direct threat to the residents of Northern Israel who can then return home,' Kemp said. 'That is not necessarily going to happen overnight.' Overnight, Reuters reported that Lebanon and Hezbollah have agreed to a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire with Israel, with some comments. Israel did not comment. Kemp stressed that Iran drives all seven battlefronts on which Israel is fighting. He has been a strong advocate for a U.S. administration that would take action against Iran alongside Israel or at least untie Israel's hands so it can cut off Iran, which he referred to as the head of the octopus. 'Israel can't do that without the support of the US,' Kemp said, referring to the ability to cut off Iran where it is at literally. 'Israel can inflict severe damage on the Iranian regime and the Iranian nuclear program, but it can't do that without the backing of the U.S. 'In the ideal world, I think the US would also go in and attack Iran with Israel,' he continued. However, he said that he does not envision that happening even under newly elected President Donald Trump. 'I do think is going to happen is the handcuffs are going to be taken off Israel to allow it the freedom to do what it needs to do and inflict significant damage on Iran so that Iran is no longer in a position to run all of these different proxies around the region against Israel and against the West,' Kemp concluded.

US Senate to consider measures blocking some arms sales to Israel	The U.S. Senate is due to vote on Wednesday on legislation that would block arms sales to Israel, backed by lawmakers who say Israel is obstructing aid shipments desperately needed by Palestinian civilians in Gaza. The 'resolutions of disapproval' were filed by Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats. Strong bipartisan support for Israel means the resolutions are not expected to pass, but backers hope they will encourage Israel's government and President Joe Biden's administration to do more to protect civilians in Gaza.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkjpvhfm1l	2024-11-18T13:49:37-08:00	
Look me in the eyes': Ex-Hamas hostage leaves pro-Palestinian ac...	Newly surfaced debate video shows Moran Stela Yanai, abducted by Hamas on October 7 and later released, sharing her story to clearly speechless pro-Palestinian activist; 'I respected them even when they abused me,' she said of her captors A debate event held last June in Los Angeles featured participants such as Mosab Hassan Yousef ('The Green Prince'), Moran Stela Yanai—a survivor kidnapped and held captive by Hamas, UCLA Y&S Nazarian Center for Israel Studies Director Prof. Dov Waxman and pro-Palestinian activist Aidan Dewolf, the organizer of a protest encampment at the same university. This event went viral on Monday following the release of the second part of the interview, where Yanai directly addresses and speaks with Dwolf. In this newly released second segment, published four months after the initial interview, Yanai is seen addressing the pro-Palestinian activist, saying, 'I really want to talk to you on eye level and tell you a story, if you want to hear it. '...When I was kidnapped to Gaza, I was caught three times. The last time, I was caught by 13 Hamas terrorists. Thirteen. I want you to acknowledge the facts as they are, truly. I’ve visited the U.S., have you ever been to Israel? Have you visited Gaza before? Probably not,' she recounts. 'On October 7, and this is what they (the terrorists) told me, they had no idea about the Nova festival, they didn’t know there were 3,000 people there. They planned, and this is what they told me, to continue onward and kill as many people as possible. In Be'er Sheva, Tel Aviv, Haifa—they wanted to slaughter everyone. 'And you know what, maybe you won’t believe me, but I can show you the videos that I have. Do you know how many bodies were there? Do you know how much violence I experienced firsthand? I was caught in the middle of the lynch; I was portrayed as a soldier because I chose that day, unintentionally, to wear olive-green clothes that looked like a uniform. That was enough to classify me as a soldier. 'And they treated me like a soldier. I’m 40 years old, look at me, I’m 40. I have a cat and a dog; I had two cats, I lost one that day. I have a mom and dad, and a brother, who left their whole lives to try and help me. My mom found out I was kidnapped through my 12-year-old niece, who saw a video on TikTok and recognized me. That’s how they found out I was kidnapped. Did you know that?' Yanai continued her dialogue with Dwolf for several more minutes, during which it was clear that he felt very uncomfortable with the direct yet calm way she presented her story to him, even struggling to maintain eye contact. Social media reactions quickly followed, with many praising Yanai's quiet strength and the way she shared her story and words with Dewolf. It should be noted that Yanai is a jewelry designer who went to the Nova Festival near Kibbutz Re'im on October 7, 2023, to sell her jewelry. During the Hamas attack on the festival, she was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists and taken to the Gaza Strip, where she was held captive for 54 days. During her captivity, Yanai had to endure harsh conditions, including humiliation and abuse. She recounted in several interviews how she was forced to beg for food and her captors' demand that she look them in the eyes, which left her with deep psychological scars. After her release, Yanai underwent a lengthy rehabilitation process. In January 2024, she returned to her home in Be'er Sheva and has since continued to share her story to raise awareness about the situation of hostages and encourage the public to advocate for them.

Pro-palestinian activists vandalize home of University of Washing...	University of Washington President Ana Mari Cauce's home and car vandalized with pro-Palestinian graffiti ahead of regents meeting on campus protests; university and ADL condemn act as crime; law enforcement investigating The home and car of University of Washington President Ana Mari Cauce were vandalized with spray-painted messages, including 'Free Palestine,' 'Blood on Your Hands,' and 'Ana Mari is Complicit in Genocide.' The incident occurred the night before a Board of Regents meeting to discuss campus policies and responses to ongoing pro-Palestinian protests. A pro-Palestinian student group shared footage of the vandalism on Instagram, claiming the act as a form of protest. The video shows masked individuals stenciling messages on Cauce’s front door and car, accompanied by a caption accusing her of complicity in 'Palestinian genocide.' Flyers with protest demands were distributed in the neighborhood, alleging the university’s ties to Boeing enable war crimes. The protesters claimed Boeing supplied half of Israel's missiles from 2021 to 2023, including those used in refugee camps. They accused the university of whitewashing Boeing’s image, citing donations exceeding $100 million and its influence in career fairs and on the university's Board of Regents. The protesters condemned Cauce, who has led the university for nearly a decade, for dismissing prior demands to sever ties with Boeing. They referenced a past statement attributed to her: 'Someone that you barely know does something pretty awful, you make one set of decisions. Someone that has been a close friend of yours since you were two (Boeing) does something pretty awful, you look at it a little bit differently.' In a statement, the protesters vowed continued action, declaring: 'So while Palestinians cannot experience peace, neither can she!! Neither can anyone who serves genocide.' University spokesperson Victor Balta condemned the vandalism, calling it 'a crime' and saying that university policy would not be influenced by threats or criminal acts. He confirmed that multiple law enforcement agencies are investigating. The Seattle chapter of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) also denounced the incident, labeling it 'vandalism, threats, and property destruction by masked activists.' The ADL called for those responsible to be held accountable and warned against escalating anti-Israel rhetoric turning violent.

Hamas' sexual crimes: Uncollected evidence come to light	Previously undocumented indicators of sexual violence by Hamas during October 7 attacks now emerging through new report compiling evidence and survivor testimonies; findings aim to shed light on scope of atrocities Warning: This article contains content some readers may find disturbing In the chaos at the IDF's Shura base on the days following the October 7 massacre, bodies of the murdered – soldiers, civilians and the occasional body that, after examination, turned out to be that of an abominable Nukhba terrorist, were piling up. On one body alongside grenades, they found an open packet of condoms. 'I read about this in the newspaper. It was part of a journal kept by a guy from Shura,' says leading Israeli lawyer, Prof. Yifat Bitton. 'Our investigator contacted him and asked, ‘Tell me, did you report this to anyone?’ He said, ‘No. We had to deal with neutralizing the grenades. Why should I be dealing with condoms?’' What might have been regarded on the ground as a rather marginal detail, for Prof. Bitton leading the struggle for recognition of Hamas’s sexual offenses, it was a warning sign. 'For me, a terrorist with condoms indicates sexual offense. Maybe the packet of condoms was on him because he’d had consensual sex just before that, and the box had simply remained in his pocket. 'However as, in the wave of terrorist incursion incidents, we have no way of verifying this, and as we know that when armed men are in an environment where women are helpless, there’s a very high risk of sexual harm, these condoms may attest to sexual assault. If Hamas can, they’re welcome to prove otherwise. Until October 7, we hadn’t seen sexual assault as part of organized Hamas operations. This perception, however, needs to change.' What does this story prove in terms of our investigations? That condoms are marginal to grenades? 'Not just marginal. It’s about seeing an outright indication right before your eyes, and erasing it from your mind. Not just because it’s not important. 'Yes, some people thought it was less important - like the senior Division of Identification and Forensic Science (DIFS) official who told me, ‘Listen, when I have the worst crime of all, murder, I don’t have to, and can’t, deal with this too.' But what they were looking at was sexual offense. Conditions also play a role: under any other circumstances, I’d examine the body in great detail, but I had 500 more bodies waiting in line.' The mass of bodies meant you couldn’t tell the whole story. 'Yes. Everyone in the Hell that was Shura had a very specific task in identifying the bodies. They remained within the area and didn’t leave it. Either their eyes didn’t look over the entire body, or they did, and decided that they couldn’t really see it and couldn’t deal with it. Psychologists we interviewed told us that this is how it works – so as to protect the workers’ mental health from permanent damage. But this, apparently minor, story is a new way of looking at what happened here.' 'The dead are dead' December 2023, a few months prior to that conversation, Bitton gave a speech at a conference she had initiated at the UN to promote world awareness of the horrific massacre’s incorporation of systematic gender-based violence. On returning home to Herzliya, however, she felt something wasn’t right. Something in the way the story was framed was distorting the big picture. 'A lieutenant colonel told me that he saw a woman tied to a pole, naked from the hips up. When I asked him what he did, he told me that he took her off the pole and completely covered her up.' 'I revisited my speech’s opening sentence in which I said that nothing in my 20 years of representing victims of sexual offenses and researching the issue, had prepared me for this moment. I asked myself why I’d opted for this sentence. Why had nothing prepared me for this? After all, it’s no surprise that women are harmed on the battlefield. Why weren’t we prepared for this moment? I felt I knew only parts of what had happened. The entirety of what happened, however, was unprecedented and so demanded new decoding tools. 'We’re trying to use existing tools to understand something that hasn’t happened in the past. This is severely detrimental to our professional ability to prove what happened and explain why the evidence is so sparse relative to the scope of attacks. I realized it would be best to listen to people who were on the ground at the time, and through them, identify the true scope of sexual offenses on October 7.' This realization led Bitton, President of Achva Academic College and head of Israel's Public Colleges Association, to an almost year-long quest resulting in an extremely comprehensive, in-depth report on October 7 sexual offenses. Alongside attorneys Vardit Avitan and Shir Burka and lawyer, Hodaya Shaked, she questioned and interviewed dozens of people from the field who saw the worst things a person could imagine. This culminated into 80 pages in Hebrew, translating into 100 English pages, to serve Israel - not just in Hasbara terms, but also for international legal purposes. In their own personal time, and modestly funded by two foundations, the researchers set out with a clear mission. 'I asked myself, why this had gotten me so much. Why couldn’t I just deal with the other horrors that occurred there? I eventually realized that the situation I was now seeing, is one so often exposed when it comes to assaults - mainly against women – and that are sidelined. This isn’t very different from what we know about sexual violence in general. It needs working on, pushing, and explaining why it matters. 'The last thing I wanted was for the sexual offenses to be used as yet one more tool with which to goad the enemy. I was looking for a way to forge recognition for the victims. I was looking to find out how, knowing what we do about these incidents, we could set up dedicated treatment and investigation structures. This was my prime motive. And no one really wanted to do it.' Did exposure to these materials affect you personally? 'The material was, obviously, very difficult. I am sadly, however, very experienced when it comes to the horrors of sexual offenses. Although it was unprecedented in terms of its scope and malevolence, I must stress that as soon as the project was about means for identifying and gathering evidence, that’s what we focused on. 'It’s also been very hard to prove the degree to which the interviewees were repressing what they’d seen or felt or were experiencing secondary trauma - that arose from the interviews. Some felt guilty, and it was important for me to explain to them that, considering the shock and chaos of what happened to us, there was nothing to feel guilty about.' The report - whose findings were forwarded to officials at Israel’s National Security Council (NSC), terrorism specialists and the authorities at the United Nations Security Council responsible for dealing with sexual violence - reveals obstacles faced by various systems, that have prevented widescale documentation of the scale of the sexual assaults. These obstacles are expressed by 'first respondents,' professionals who, on October 7, encountered what we couldn’t have imagined in our worst nightmares. These include Zaka, police and Border Police, personnel as well as doctors at Camp Shura. This failure touched on not only gathering evidence, but also the preliminary inquiry. It turns out that Israeli combatants in the massacre areas weren’t asked questions about sexual offenses. A senior police officer says in the report that this was sometimes a conscious decision, 'so as to keep soldiers’ spirits robust, as they were returning to the battlefield.' Another senior ranking Border Police officer told the investigator that she saw, 'Loads of bras and underwear strewn around the party ground.' Bitton says, 'She hadn’t told anyone before, as she wasn’t asked questions about indications, but rather about sexual offenses. 'If you ask, ‘Did you see sexual assaults,’ the answer would be no. But if you were to ask, ‘Did you see anything relating to women that looked odd to you,’ she’d say, ‘Actually yes.’ For me, this constitutes an indication of sexual offenses. That same officer did not photograph what he saw, and also instructed her subordinates not to photograph them either.' Why? 'Because they were told, ‘We need to focus on the people who are alive. The dead are dead.' I heard this cited by both soldiers and psychologists. ‘This is what matters,' ‘This is what’s relevant.' These are the quotes. We’re now talking about an accumulation of almost 500 pieces of digital evidence. 'I remember two burned bodies whose legs were spread. In real time, we wanted to identify the bodies, not find out what had happened to them.' 'In the videos, you don’t have to look for gang rape. You need to look for pictures of underwear on the ground. Understanding that we have to ask about indications, rather than the sexual offenses themselves, is groundbreaking.' Many interviewed said that they didn’t forward the evidence they had photographed on their personal phones. 'For example, pictures including very serious indications of sexual offenses, not passed on for fear of violating the victim’s privacy,' says Bitton. A senior Zaka official, who was present at the massacre scene, said he had a whole gallery of pictures he’d taken on his phone that he didn’t know what to do with.' 'A lieutenant colonel told me that he saw a woman tied to a pole, naked from the hips up. When I asked him what he did, he told me that he took her off the pole and completely covered her up. ‘It was important for me to put an end to her denegation, and certainly not document her in this horrific condition.' I understand the compassion by which he was guided, but that shouldn’t negate the importance of documentation, as long as there are clear and ethical guidelines as to how to do it.' Hodaya Shaked, who collaborated on the report alongside Prof. Bitton, says, 'One interviewee told me that, while surveying and clearing the bodies, he found a used condom on a bed in a house in the Gaza Periphery. He didn’t think to report it, and only thought about it differently when we talked about it.' From these examples, we learn of the lack of readiness for terrorism that incorporates sexual violence - not just in the field, but afterward too, at Camp Shura. 'Naked, or partially naked, bodies were showing up at Shura, and no one documented it,' says Bitton. 'At Shura, they photographed operational injury. They didn’t, for example, photograph bruising adjacent to sexual organs.' Coining a term: Sexual terror attack Dr. Naama Samet, oral and maxillofacial surgery specialist, who has been volunteering with the IDF’s victims’ identification unit for the past 15 years, encountered this in the six weeks she spent identifying hundreds of bodies at Shura. She supports Prof. Bitton and her investigation team’s grim conclusions. 'The thought of sexual assault didn’t cross our minds,' she says. 'We just opened up the top part of the body bags. On the second or third day, a Zaka guy rolled in a body in a cart. Helping him bring it in, I said, ‘There’s something strange here.' I thought there was another body inside. We then removed the body bag and saw that the pelvis was very clearly broken. This is how we understood that sexual assaults had occurred.' Did it change the rest of the examinations? 'No. There wasn’t time for that. At some stage, you close up, just to get through. I remember two burned bodies whose legs were spread. In real-time, we wanted to identify the bodies, not find out what had happened to them. That was a mistake, but it would have taken months had we acted otherwise. There were horrific stories there.' Bitton continues, 'We suddenly realized that burning the houses and bodies or shooting the sexual organs was, in part, means to conceal the sexual assaults. Pramila Patten (United Nations Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, who came to Israel in January and then compiled a report concluding that sexual assaults by Hamas had indeed occurred), confirmed there had many gunshots at sexual organs, mainly but not only, of women.' 'At first, we viewed it as some kind of sexual obsession of theirs or efforts to eliminate sexuality. I now tell myself that this, in and of itself, constitutes sexual assault and that I can perhaps use this as an indication of covering up acute sexual assaults.' In hindsight, we understand that assaults were on a greater scale, that so much evidence has been buried. 'Definitely. We’re proving that very clearly.' Legal research and security expert Capt. (res.) Att. Shir Burka, who has been serving as war room commander at the Gaza Division for over a decade, was called on the afternoon of October 7 to the Northern Brigade’s improvised war room in the south of the country. 'As a war room officer, I experienced first-hand the tremendous chaos on the ground in the first days after the attack. Our priorities were clear: protecting human life, evacuating the dead and wounded, and preparing for an attack. At no stage were we briefed about sexual offenses.' 'With my background representing victims of sexual assault, as our work on the report progressed, I saw evermore gaps in the evidence and I could only scream out against the omission and the possibility that so many forces on the ground could have contributed toward identifying and documenting sexual offenses. But hindsight‘s 20/20. Had there been any awareness of it, things would have certainly looked different.' Bitton: 'Visiting one of the Gaza Periphery communities, I asked a local man to show me where the horrors had taken place. I wanted to be there, to smell it, hear the silent voices of the people I’m trying to make heard. As he was talking, I realized that he was, inadvertently, showing me a strong, horrific indication of the acute sexual abuse of two women. 'Realizing this, and not wanting to upset him, I asked him questions around the subject. With my tools, I continued the investigation in the house, went back to my interviewees, reconfirmed that what I had heard was correct, and learned that I was correct in my assessment. Talking to a police representative, I found that the police didn’t know about it.' What did he say constituted an indication? 'He said that something just didn’t hang together about the house we were in. It was clear that what happened here, wasn’t what he had thought, and that he had no explanation as to what had happened, and that was telling himself the same story everyone probably tells themselves: They see an indication, but don’t regard it as demonstrating a high chance of sexual assault.' Didn’t that put you in the position of police investigator? 'Definitely not. I’m not here to replace the police. We always forwarded new stories or evidence to which we were exposed. That’s not my role, and shouldn’t be anyone else’s role. That’s the state’s role.' 'It’s critical the state should adopt this report, the bodies mentioned in it read it, understand what’s missing in their work, and make corrections accordingly.' In their report, Bitton and her partners present new perceptions. Firstly: the obstacles faced in collecting and documenting evidence of sexual offenses, are rooted in this being a totally different kind of attack. And secondly: it may well happen again. Let’s start with the first. The investigators called the October 7 terrorist attack an 'incursive incident.' Bitton says, 'This short-term attack on the land of a sovereign Westen state is a world-first. It’s an incursive terrorist incident in that they were invaders, they wandered around in the field, caused destruction, and left. 'Sexual offenses in Ukraine, for example, were part of an ongoing war. This is in no way similar to an incursive incident whose main purpose was killing as many people as possible, in which the victims were killed systematically.' Prof. Boaz Ganor, President of Reichman University and the founder of the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT), who ranks among the world’s top terrorism experts, reiterates this. 'I don’t remember any similar incident in modern times. Perhaps, the Boko Haram attack in Nigeria where they kidnapped girls from school, hurt them, and sold them as concubines. We also saw ISIS do this to the Yazidi women.' Ganor addresses another terrifying report conclusion regarding the likelihood of a second such attack in the wider world. 'In the history of modern terrorism, attacks carried out against the State of Israel, serve as a model copied by other organizations. In the 1960s, Israel ranked among the countries suffering most from airplane hijackings. 'We then saw it spread to other places, among other things, because Israel found ways to better address the issue. It was similar with suicide attacks that started here in 1992, and a decade later became familiar in Europe and the U.S. So, one must ask whether October 7 could serve as a model to be imitated in other Western countries.' And what do you think? 'I think that an incursive terrorist attack like this can be imitated in places adjacent to territories over which the state has no effective control. If we look at Europe and the US, it doesn’t seem likely. However, we’re beginning to see areas over which the state has little, or no, effective control. 'Even in Europe, there are areas - like Brussels’ Molenbeek neighborhood, that the police and law enforcement authorities seldom, or fear to, go. Paris also has quarters like this. I believe we’ll probably see incursive terrorist attacks from such neighborhoods in Europe, similar in essence to the October 7 incursion attack.' What do you feel this report contributes? 'It has two important aspects. Firstly: casting light on the horrific sexual offenses committed on October 7. Secondly: addressing the challenges faced by first respondents arriving at the scene of such a huge incursive terrorist attack, who are busy dealing with other issues like saving lives, fighting, and obviously not collecting the facts required to prove sexual offenses. 'In the wider world, some people are still saying that these claims are some kind of Israeli scam. This report says that, alongside other activity, it’s also important to have clear guidelines and operating methods to gather the evidence, not only for indictment purposes, but also to show the world.' Challenges in making sense of evidence 'It was important for me to investigate how these various structures operated,' says Bitton. 'Was there any kind of awareness, and what did they do? The answer is that people on the ground were not aware of it, and so did almost nothing. I’m not criticizing them. It’s Hell. Guilt must rest on Hamas who caused the chaos.' The report, however, presents the state’s failures. 'We have to view them as shortcomings - the inability to imagine. I call it, ‘When the unimaginable becomes a reality.' It’s a nightmare. It no use judging in hindsight.' Att. Vardit Avidan, Bitton's team’s sexual protection expert, supports this. 'It was important for us to cast blame on Hamas. Yes, a response could have been better in some cases, but if we prepare correctly, we’ll be able to get better evidence in the future.' How? Bitton: 'I learned that the DIFS is the only organization that can identify dead civilians in Israel. This is the only body in the country authorized to conduct this procedure. The identification process involves taking fingerprints, dental photos and conducting DNA tests. This means that Israel’s number one investigation body was conducting an activity that’s very easy to train people on the ground to do.' 'The sheer workload meant that that it was a month before DIFS got into the field, by which time the crime scenes had been corrupted, damaged or destroyed. This was the case for the Nahal Oz outpost where dozens of male and female soldiers - and the highest number of women - were murdered. 'The army’s surveillance unit, with its forensic documentation expertise (which it may utilize in the future) didn’t manage to get there at all. Instead, Zaka evacuated the bodies from the scene to another kibbutz. One interviewee told me ‘By that stage, you couldn’t understand who was who.'' 'These are evidentiary problems from Hell. There was also a lack of collaboration between the various respondents who were working under fire and the fear of being kidnapped. And yet, when we finally come to talk about sexual offenses, they have the tenacity to ask us, ‘Where’s your evidence?.'' Has anything changed in procedures since then? 'The answer is not yet. That’s why I believe it’s critical the state should adopt this report, the bodies mentioned in it read it, understand what’s missing in their work, and make corrections accordingly. We know that this doesn’t generally happen on its own, so we need a body to handle these incidents and oversee that it really does happen.' 'As for overseas, I’m supposed to meet international organizations in the United States soon to explain to them what this means for them. I’m working with the embassy to present it at Congress. The German parliament’s representative to the United Nations has also asked me to forward the report to her, and there’s a coalition of sorts of politicians from across the globe, set up by Yesh Atid MK Shelly Meron, who want to address the matter at an international level.' This is impressive, but how willing is the world to listen to Israel while the war is still ongoing? 'Our story isn’t making waves - to say the least. I think the world isn’t listening to the story from the Israeli angle, or even the women’s angle. It might be of interest to various terrorism experts and anyone fighting terror. 'Transferring the burden of proof to the terrorist organizations in a structured manner, as the report does, is of great interest to them. In this respect, I think they are listening, as it’s a story with universal implications. Explaining that this is a universal story, rather than just an Israeli story, is part of the issue. And as a universal feminist, it’s important for me to protect women – whoever they may be.' Although the world’s women’s organizations messed up. 'Lots of them behaved shamefully because, among other things, I think, it’s connected to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and they believe it couldn’t happen to women in the middle of Europe. In my dealings with these organizations, I don’t behave as if I’m angry with them, but rather I’m critical of their failure to fulfill the role they’ve been mandated to perform. 'This professional report, which explains how these situations should be managed, is a strong tool to address the international community’s disgraceful conduct and one that can be relevant later for indictment purposes. Presenting this to the world is, essentially, part of the new challenges that terrorism poses to humanity. Under no circumstances should this story be sidelined.'

Lebanon, Hezbollah agree to US proposal for cease-fire with Israe...	Lebanon and Hezbollah have agreed to a U.S. proposal for a cease-fire with Israel with some comments on the content, a top Lebanese official told Reuters on Monday, describing the effort as the most serious yet to end the fighting. Ali Hassan Khalil, an aide to Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, said Lebanon had delivered its written response to the U.S. ambassador in Lebanon on Monday, and White House envoy Amos Hochstein was traveling to Beirut to continue talks. 'Lebanon presented its comments on the paper in a positive atmosphere,' Khalil said, declining to give further details. 'All the comments that we presented affirm the precise adherence to (UN) Resolution 1701 with all its provisions,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkfb4vfm1x	2024-11-18T12:40:40-08:00

The IDF said Monday that an investigation into the impact site in Ramat Gan determined the damage was caused by debris from a rocket intercepted by air defense systems. According to a preliminary assessment, the interceptor struck a surface-to-surface rocket launched from Lebanon at a high altitude, breaking it into several fragments. Some of the debris fell to the ground, causing damage and injuries, the IDF said. 'The incident is under investigation,' the military added in its statement.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rygzweyzkg	2024-11-18T12:27:50-08:00	
Berlin police advise LGBTQ and Jews to avoid Arab-majority areas	Berlin Police Chief Barbara Slowik urges visibly Jewish and LGBTQ individuals to exercise caution in Arab-majority neighborhoods, citing open antisemitism and sympathy for terrorism; police recorded 6,200 antisemitic incidents since October 7 Once regarded as a bastion of inclusivity and cosmopolitan culture, Berlin is increasingly reflecting broader trends sweeping Germany: rising radicalization among Muslim migrants, a political shift to the right and heightened antisemitism and fear of violence. Berlin Police Chief Barbara Slowik acknowledged these changes in an interview with the Berliner Zeitung daily, saying that while the city does not have 'no-go zones,' certain areas may be unsafe for visibly Jewish individuals or members of the LGBTQ community. 'There are, unfortunately, neighborhoods in Berlin with a majority of residents from Arab backgrounds where there is open sympathy for terrorist organizations and very blatant antisemitism,' she said. Since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Berlin police have launched investigations into 6,200 antisemitic incidents, including physical assaults, online hate speech and attacks on police during pro-Palestinian protests. Antisemitic incidents have surged by 50% compared to 2022, with two-thirds occurring after October 7. LGBTQ individuals in Berlin have also reported a growing fear of violence in neighborhoods with significant Arab populations. Many members of the community now conceal their identities, avoid public displays of affection and seek escorts when leaving bars in these areas. In a notable incident, the owner of a prominent LGBTQ pub in Kreuzberg opposed the establishment of a refugee shelter nearby, citing ongoing physical assaults against her patrons by local residents. Slowik warned that Berlin’s police force is stretched thin, citing increased responsibilities since October 7, including daily pro-Palestinian protests and heightened security for Jewish and Israeli institutions. 'Our resources are being tested to their limits,' she said, calling for greater support to address the mounting challenges.

FM Sa'ar urges UN to address attacks on Israel by pro-Iran militi...	Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar announced Monday that he has sent a letter to the president of the UN Security Council, urging immediate action to address the activities of pro-Iranian militias operating in Iraq, whose territory has been used for attacks on Israel. Sa’ar emphasized in the letter that the Iraqi government is responsible for any actions occurring within or from its territory. He stressed Israel's right to self-defense, as enshrined in the UN Charter, to protect itself and its citizens. 'I called on the council to act urgently to ensure that the Iraqi government fulfills its obligations under international law and to put an end to these attacks on Israel,' Sa’ar said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skvec7kmjx	2024-11-18T12:14:26-08:00	
Achtung! Germany, other EU nations set to tighten entry due to im...	European nations tightening border controls as far-right influence rises; Germany, Netherlands lead with stricter checks citing illegal immigration and security concerns; from 2025, biometric data and new entry protocols will apply for non-EU citizens The resurgence of populist far-right movements across numerous Western nations is a well-documented trend. However, in recent weeks, this tide of anti-immigration, anti-democratic and anti-European Union sentiment has been accompanied by a reimplementation of stringent border security measures. Once emblematic of a peaceful, integrated Europe characterized by open borders and seamless cross-national movement, these ideals now seem distant as border protections are being re-enforced. This shift challenges the very relevance of the Schengen Agreements, a treaty that led to the creation of Europe's Schengen Area, in which internal border checks have largely been abolished. Countries like Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Austria and Denmark have heightened border security, with some extending these measures into May and June 2025. Germany spearheaded this initiative, responding to growing opposition to illegal immigration and concerns over radical Islam by reinstating strict border checks with France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Denmark. The right-wing Dutch government announced similar measures last week. Despite a post-COVID-19 rebound in European tourism throughout 2024, escalating illegal immigration, expanding criminal networks and terrorism fears are likely to result in prolonged border crossing times, especially for non-European passport holders. While existing regulations, such as the allowance for stays of up to 90 days every six months for non-EU passport holders remain unchanged, enforcement is set to intensify, particularly at land borders. This will impact those traveling between Schengen countries by car, bus or train. Starting in 2025, those entering Europe without an EU passport will undergo biometric registration, including fingerprinting, with data stored for three years. Additionally, from the beginning of next year, all foreign nationals exempt from visa requirements will need to complete an online form with a nominal fee to stay in Europe, akin to the U.S. ESTA system. Under the Schengen Agreements, EU member states are not meant to enforce border crossings but can temporarily intensify border checks with four weeks' notice if they substantiate that such measures will mitigate a genuine security threat. This must be a last resort under the agreement. It appears many European countries now regard this as their final option.

Criminals steal machine guns from IDF troops in northern Israel	3 MAG machine guns stolen from IDF troops near Lebanon border, as criminals increasingly target military weapons; Military Police probe underway Three MAG machine guns were stolen from IDF infantry forces stationed near a village in northern Israel, the military confirmed Monday. The theft occurred last week while the soldiers were taking a break in a designated assembly area near the Lebanon border. The weapons were taken from military vehicles left unattended. The IDF said that the Military Police has launched an investigation, and its findings will be reviewed by the Military Advocate General. 'Naturally, we cannot share details of an ongoing investigation,' the statement added. Local police in Israel’s northern district said they were unaware of the incident. The theft highlights an ongoing issue of military-grade weapons being targeted by criminal organizations. MAG machine guns, which are highly sought after in the criminal underworld, were reportedly valued at up to half a million shekels ($135,000) on the black market before the war. Experts believe prices have since risen. This is not the first instance of weapon theft from military assembly areas. In November last year, grenades, explosives, ammunition and M16 rifles were stolen from IDF positions in the Galilee. The thieves had distributed food and clothing to soldiers as part of a diversion tactic before stealing the weapons. Three suspects, Arab-Israeli residents of nearby villages, were later arrested and charged. In October, shortly after Hamas’ attacks in southern Israel, a MAG machine gun was stolen from soldiers who had left it behind while seeking shelter during a rocket alert in the town of Avdon. In another incident, criminals stole a LAW anti-tank missile from a reservist battalion stationed along the northern border. Police have warned that since the start of the war, criminal groups have increasingly targeted military personnel, exploiting moments of inattention to steal weapons and equipment. Investigations into these incidents are ongoing.

Trump taps oil industry leader as energy secretary	Chris Wright lacks political experience but aligns with Trump's positions, seeking to expand US oil and gas industries despite climate crisis November 2024 marks the hottest on record for eastern U.S. residents in places like New York, Vermont and even Maine, who are experiencing weather that might have been considered fitting for summer just a few decades ago. Meanwhile, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Chris Wright, a senior figure in the oil and gas industry and a climate change skeptic, as his energy secretary. Wright is the founder and CEO of Liberty Energy, a Denver-based drilling company. He is expected to back Trump's agenda to maximize oil and gas production and explore ways to boost electricity output, which is seeing rising demand for the first time in decades. Last year, Wright shared a video on his LinkedIn profile declaring, ' There is no climate crisis, and we’re not in the midst of an energy transition, either.' He labeled climate activists as 'hysterical' and likened Democratic efforts to combat global warming to Soviet-style communism. He has also written extensively about the need for increased fossil fuel production 'to lift people out of poverty.' Wright’s appointment isn’t surprising, as Trump raised hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions from the oil and gas industry and pledged to free it from regulations, despite the U.S. reaching record-high oil production under U.S. President Joe Biden. Though Wright has no political experience, his style aligns with Trump’s. In 2019, he famously drank a liquid used in drilling on camera to prove it wasn’t harmful. He will replace outgoing energy secretary Jennifer Granholm, an advocate for electric vehicles and green energy. Trump also announced that one of his personal attorneys, Will Scharf, will serve as White House chief of staff. Scharf, a former federal prosecutor, was part of Trump’s legal team in his successful bid to secure broad immunity from the Supreme Court. The day after Trump’s victory, Scharf tweeted 'Bye Jack,' referring to special counsel Jack Smith, who is concluding investigations against Trump.

Saudi festival featuring J.Lo criticized amid Gaza war, destructi...	As Gaza war rages, Saudi Arabia's Riyadh Season, spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, comes under fire; performance by Jennifer Lopez in revealing outfit sparks accusations of undermining country's cultural values and sanctity Saudi Arabia hosted the Arab-Islamic Summit last week and has been holding a vastly different event for over a month. On Oct. 12, the kingdom launched 'Riyadh Season,' a massive festival that runs through March 2025. Featuring concerts, cultural shows, fashion events, culinary experiences, and sports activities for all ages, the festival spans multiple zones in Riyadh, each offering attractions such as theme parks, restaurants, exhibitions, and manicured gardens, including a zoo. Launched in 2019, Riyadh Season is part of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, an initiative to diversify the kingdom’s economy by promoting tourism and reducing reliance on oil revenue. Each year, the festival draws millions of visitors. During its first month this year, it has hosted prominent Arab and international celebrities. The festival is spearheaded by Turki Al-Sheikh, chairman of Saudi Arabia’s General Entertainment Authority. While widely praised online, this year’s event has drawn sharp criticism due to ongoing wars in the region and the festival’s content. Critics argue that holding such celebrations amid the prolonged wars in Gaza and Lebanon is tone-deaf. A similar backlash arose during Riyadh Season 2023, which launched last October during the early days of the Israel-Hamas war. Critics used hashtags like 'Gaza is destroyed, Riyadh celebrates' to condemn the festivities. Despite this, last year’s festival reached a record 20 million visitors. This year’s criticism intensified after a fashion show by Lebanese designer Elie Saab, one of the season’s highlights, sparked controversy. Titled '1001 Seasons of Elie Saab,' the show fused modern aesthetics with Arab heritage, drawing inspiration from One Thousand and One Nights. It featured performances by global stars Céline Dion, Camila Cabello, and Jennifer Lopez. Lopez, in particular, faced online backlash for her revealing attire and dance routines, which some argued clashed with Saudi Arabia’s religious character as the 'Land of the Two Holy Mosques.' Critics accused the event of desecrating the kingdom’s sanctity, targeting both Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turki Al-Sheikh for hosting such performances. A user on X (formerly Twitter) shared a video of Camila Cabello from the fashion show, writing: 'Forgive us, Prophet of God, for this video. Forgive us for celebrating Riyadh’s ‘season of porn’ while Gaza fights. Where are Saudi Arabia’s free people to stand up to Turki Al-Sheikh and his thugs?' Another account criticized the event, stating, 'Where are the real stars? In the sky,' referencing the wars in Gaza and Lebanon.

Iran planned to assassinate former Canadian justice minister, rep...	Canadian authorities say foiled plot against human rights and anti-IRGC advocate Irwin Cotler, whose daughter served as a Knesset member in Israel; Tehran denies allegations Canadian authorities foiled an Iranian plot to assassinate Prof. Irwin Cotler, a former Canadian justice minister and the stepfather of former Knesset member Michal Cotler-Wunsh, the Foreign Ministry's special envoy for combating antisemitism and delegitimization. Cotler, who currently chairs the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights and is a vocal critic of Iran, received a warning about an immediate threat to his life on October 26. According to the Globe and Mail, Canadian police identified two suspects in the plot, though no further details about the investigation have been disclosed. The 84-year-old Cotler has been under tight security since the October 7 massacre due to his vocal support for Israel. Serving as Canada’s justice minister from 2003 to 2006, he retired from politics in 2015. His daughter was elected to the Knesset in 2020 as part of the Blue and White party, serving less than a year. Since October 7, Cotler's security has included armored vehicles and an escort of armed officers. However, the alert he received at the end of last month was clear and unambiguous saying his life was in danger and an assassination attempt could be made against him by Iranian agents operating in Canada within 48 hours. While Cotler is accustomed to threats due to his pro-Israel stance, the incident has placed him at the center of an international saga involving terrorism, diplomacy and the ongoing fight for human rights. Since stepping down as justice minister, Cotler has become a prominent figure in combating antisemitism and hate crimes. The Raoul Wallenberg Centre he leads — named after the Swedish diplomat who saved thousands of Jews during the Holocaust — focuses on fighting oppressive regimes and institutionalized violence. Cotler’s activism includes extensive campaigns to designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. These efforts culminated in June when Canada officially classified the IRGC as such — a move that was met with outrage in Tehran. Cotler has also long represented Iranian political prisoners, including prominent activists opposing the Islamic regime. Allegations against the Iranian regime aren’t without precedent, as several Iranian plots to target political leaders and activists worldwide have been uncovered over the past year. Just this month, the U.S. Department of Justice revealed a foiled Iranian plan to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump prior to the elections. Iran’s Foreign Ministry dismissed the allegations, labeling them a 'reprehensible fabrication' attributed to Israel and regime opponents, without providing detailed responses to the claims.

IDF reserve officer flees Cyprus over possible war crimes allegat...	Authorities advise IDF officer to leave Cyprus and return to Israel after pro-Palestinian groups use social media footage from his service in Gaza to request arrest on alleged ‘genocide’ charges An IDF reserve officer who served in Gaza was forced to leave Cyprus and return to Israel over the weekend at the urging of the Foreign and Justice Ministries, fearing that pro-Palestinian organizations in the country might pursue arrest warrants against him for alleged war crimes. The decision followed revelations that the officer had uploaded videos from Gaza to social media over the past year, including footage in which he appeared to boast about his actions. In one video, for instance, he said, 'We're here in Rafah — we won’t stop until we burn all of Gaza.' The reservist, identified as A.L., posted videos documenting his service in Gaza during the war. Last week, he also shared that he and his wife were traveling to Cyprus for a vacation. This announcement became the basis for pro-Palestinian organizations, including the Belgian group March 30, to seek an arrest warrant. The group tracks Israeli soldiers with the intent to prosecute them in Europe for alleged war crimes. The group filed an official complaint with Cypriot authorities accusing the soldier, based on the videos he posted, of war crimes and 'genocide' in Gaza. 'We demand his arrest and investigation,' the group said. Other organizations, such as the Hind Rajab Foundation, joined the complaint and provided links to the reservist’s videos as evidence. Israeli authorities closely monitored the situation. The Foreign Ministry, in coordination with the Justice Ministry and Israel’s embassy in Cyprus, contacted A.L. and advised him to leave the country. Ultimately, it was decided he should return to Israel immediately to avoid potential legal complications. The urgency may have been heightened by an X post from the Hind Rajab Foundation, which read, 'Cyprus has officially opened an investigation into the case and has communicated this to our legal team. This is a step in the right direction. We now hope that Cyprus will stand firm against the inevitable political pressure and hold/interrogate the suspect.' After returning to Israel, A.L. posted on social media: 'We’ll share later what we’ve been through and what a miracle it is that we’re back here, two days earlier than originally planned.' Sources familiar with the case criticized A.L. for acting irresponsibly by posting incriminating footage from his reserve service, reportedly in violation of IDF orders. They also faulted the IDF for failing to enforce stricter guidelines to prevent such posts, which they said expose Israel to legal challenges and harm its international standing.

Hezbollah rocket kills 1, injures 5 in northern Arab town	Emergency services report firefighters rescued woman trapped in apartment hit by rocket, but she later succumbed to her wounds; several others sustained minor injuries in attack A Hezbollah rocket struck the northern Israeli town of Shfar’am on Monday, killing one woman and injuring at least five others, Magen David Adom (MDA) Director Eli Bin reported on Monday. Paramedics rescued the woman from an apartment hit directly by the rocket but were unable to save her despite resuscitation efforts. 'Unfortunately, a woman was killed as a result of a direct hit on a residential building,' said Rami Suwaed, a United Hatzalah paramedic who responded to the scene. 'We also assisted over 20 residents with various injuries, some of whom were evacuated by ambulance.' The IDF reported that approximately five projectiles were launched from Lebanon, with interception attempts made. The IDF confirmed that some projectiles hit Israeli territory. The rocket attack comes as the military intensifies its campaign against Hezbollah strongholds in Beirut, with airstrikes pounding the capital’s Dahieh district. Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper Al-Akhbar reported that damage in Dahieh has reached an estimated $630 million, with rebuilding across Lebanon after Israeli strikes projected to cost $3 billion—matching the toll of the 2006 Second Lebanon War. The ongoing fighting continues against the backdrop of efforts to secure a cease-fire deal in Lebanon mediated by the U.S., to which Israel has agreed. Hezbollah submitted its response to the cease-fire proposal presented by U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, Lebanon's LBCI channel reported late on Sunday. Hochstein is due to arrive in Beirut as early as Tuesday and receive the official Lebanese position.

Ben-Gvir says AG out to get him in alleged ‘criminal scandal'	National security minister claims Gali Baharav-Miara instructed aides to ‘find something’ on him; Smotrich calls for her dismissal over ‘hostile conduct’; Netanyahu, who had previously opposed efforts to remove her, reportedly reconsidering dismissal National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir accused Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara on Monday of orchestrating politically motivated investigations against him, escalating his ongoing clash with the judiciary. Speaking at a meeting of his Otzma Yehudit party, Ben-Gvir claimed to expose a 'serious criminal scandal,' alleging that Baharav-Miara sought to target him for his controversial policy of distributing firearms. According to Ben-Gvir, a deputy in the attorney general’s office visited the police’s Lahav 433 anti-corruption unit months ago to initiate a probe into his firearm distribution initiative. When investigators reportedly found no grounds for an inquiry, Ben-Gvir claimed Baharav-Miara demanded a more aggressive approach, allegedly instructing her deputies to 'find something' against him. The Attorney General denied the accusations, calling them baseless and unsupported by evidence. 'There is no truth to these claims,' Baharav-Miara said in a statement. In a social media post following his remarks, Ben-Gvir challenged Baharav-Miara to take a lie detector test. 'Gali, let’s you and I go to a polygraph,' he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Ben-Gvir accused the attorney general of weaponizing investigations against politicians, alleging that her actions amount to a 'targeted assassination' of his political career. He further claimed she aims to undermine the government and democracy itself, pointing to past investigations of officials close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as evidence. 'She allowed the previous government to do whatever it wanted,' Ben-Gvir said. 'As a government, we have no choice but to dismiss her. She is persecuting us.' Baharav-Miara, who has frequently clashed with Ben-Gvir and other members of Netanyahu’s coalition, has faced repeated calls for her removal amid accusations of overreach. However, her office insists its actions are strictly professional and impartial. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich launched a scathing attack on the attorney general, accusing her of consistently undermining the government’s agenda. 'The hostile conduct led by the attorney general is designed to challenge the government at every turn,' Smotrich said during a Cabinet meeting. He cited an incident where Baharav-Miara opposed a government decision to limit the tenure of legal advisers to seven years—a policy established in 2009. 'As always, she fights decisions to serve her personal interests, protecting her friends and funneling millions of shekels into their pockets at the expense of Israeli citizens,' Smotrich claimed. Smotrich called on Baharav-Miara to resign, accusing her of abusing her authority for political purposes. 'If you have a shred of integrity, step down as attorney general, take off your judicial robes and pursue your political battles in a democratic manner from Kaplan Street,' he said, referring to weekly anti-government protests in Tel Aviv. 'Only then can we prevent the erosion of public trust in the justice system and stop the deepening divide among the people.' A senior government official told Ynet that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had previously resisted efforts to remove Baharav-Miara from her post, may now be reconsidering. 'Something has changed,' the official said. Netanyahu is reportedly emboldened by recent military successes in Gaza and the change of administration in the United States. He also noted the relative calm following the controversial dismissal of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant earlier this month. Advisers close to Netanyahu are urging him to act, describing Baharav-Miara as a 'major obstacle' to advancing key legislation, including proposed laws related to military draft exemptions for ultra-Orthodox men.

Saudi prince's 'genocide' accusation against Israel 'intended to ...	Over-the-top anti-Israel statement' result of Saudi recognition normalization and possible defense treaty with Washington won't be achieved soon due to ongoing war in Gaza and presidential transition in US, security expert says Arab and Muslim leaders concluded a landmark summit in Riyadh last week, where they addressed the pressing issues facing the region, including the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and southern Lebanon and the evolving roles of Iran and the United States following Donald Trump’s recent reelection. In their closing statement, all 57 leaders participating in the Extraordinary Arab and Islamic Summit called for a return to the 1967 borders and unanimously emphasized the importance of establishing a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, despite his country’s ongoing efforts to bridge gaps and pursue normalization with Israel, which has long been a goal of the United States, referred to Israel’s actions in Gaza as a 'collective genocide.' 'The over-the-top anti-Israel statement of the summit was a result of the Saudi recognition that normalization and a possible defense treaty with Washington will not be achieved soon due to the ongoing war in Gaza and the presidential transition in America,' explained John Hannah, senior fellow at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA). 'This rhetoric is functional to placate the public and Iran. These regimes are experts at providing something for public consumption and then doing the exact opposite way later on.' Following the summit, Hamas called on Arab and Muslim nations to translate their pledges into concrete actions, urging immediate efforts to halt Israeli aggression. 'The establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital would require more immediate efforts and practical solutions to force (Israel) to stop its aggression and genocide against our people,' Hamas declared in a statement. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati cautioned that his country is enduring an 'existential' crisis and subtly criticized foreign interference, with an implied reference to Iran. Meanwhile, Israeli officials such as Prime Minister Netanyahu dismissed the idea of a Palestinian state, calling it 'unrealistic.' On Monday, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich went further by pledging to push for annexing parts of the West Bank by 2025, stirring additional controversy. 'These meetings were just another example of trying to whitewash Saudi’s position by talking about Palestinian rights, but in reality, Saudi Arabia has proven to be on Israel’s side, as well as America’s,' argued Hugh Miles, founder of Arab Digest. 'Qatar has stolen the limelight diplomatically over these months, so Saudi Arabia is looking for ways to please Donald Trump and Israel—Saudi shares strong ties with Trump and his family, particularly his son-in-law Kushner. So, the kingdom feels shielded in many ways with this administration,' he added. Saudi Arabia occupies a unique position, balancing its strong ties with the U.S. while simultaneously reopening dialogue with Iran, a nation it has traditionally viewed as a regional threat. 'Saudi Arabia is clearly afraid of Iran, and these meetings are a way to please it somehow and avoid a bigger threat to the country, which could jeopardize the existence of the monarchy directly,' commented Joshua Teitelbaum, professor at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University. 'Iran is in a very powerful position. They can close the Strait of Hormuz and plunge the world economy into crisis with one press of a button. They can also affect Saudi’s economy and even drag the kingdom into a regional war if they want to. Everything is intertwined right now: If Israel somehow loses the war, the Saudi monarchy might not survive either,' added Miles. Despite claims of retaliatory intentions over the past month, Iran has yet to respond directly to Israel, raising questions about its strategic calculus under increasing American pressure in the region. 'No doubt Iranians are nervous and shaken by Trump. The regime is more vulnerable than ever, and its ‘insurance policies’—such as its proxies—have been gradually weakened. The Iranian attacks didn’t manage to damage Israel at all, while Israel succeeded in harming the regime’s air defenses. Even the country’s economy is in shambles, and the regime has lost legitimacy in front of its people. So, of course, from now on, they must be very careful,' concluded Hannah. 'The Arab and Muslim world is winning, while Israel is slowly losing the war, both due to its internal divisions and the impact of BDS and criticism against its war crimes,' Miles concluded. 'The Middle East is about to change drastically, and Zionism could cease to exist in the process.' The story is written by Giorgia Valente and reprinted with permission from The Media Line.

Can war bring security to the north? Ynet's senior defense analys...	Ron Ben Yishai says success of the military's ground offensive to remove an immediate threat from the Galilee is evident, but Israel must insist on extensive authority of the international community to ensure Hezbollah's compliance with terms of the cease-fire While the IDF completes its mission in South Lebanon, assigned to it by the government, and amid advanced negotiations for a cease-fire that would end the war in the north and allow residents evacuated from their homes to return after more than a year, and allow rebuilding of destroyed communities to begin, questions mount about what the day after the war will look like. 'Before traveling to Washington and Moscow, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer should have come here to see the reality on the ground, Metula Mayor David Azulay said recently. Ynet's senior defense analyst Ron Ben Yishai says the IDF has been removing roadblocks that prevented civilians from approaching areas near the border, that were under Hezbollah anti-tank missile fire. This, he explains, indicates the military's operations in South Lebanon have been successful in removing the immediate threat. The IDF has neutralized most of Hezbollah's armaments but, more than that, the troops have prevented the flow of arms to the south. What remains a problem is Hezbollah's use of attack drones. Ben Yishai says Israel is under attack from Lebanon but also Iraq and Yemen. Those drones can be intercepted because they are detected early and are intercepted away from Israel's borders, but the drones launched from within Lebanon are more of a challenge. Even when a drone launch is detected and followed as it makes its way through Israeli territory, there is a risk of shooting it down over populated areas because of the explosives it carries. The cease-fire agreement nearing its final stages, that would end the fighting in Lebanon, is a good one, according to Ben Yishai. But Israel must insist that an international commission is set up to oversee the implementation of the cease-fire terms. If such a commission is given the proper authority, there is no need to insist on written assurances from the U.S. that the IDF would have the freedom to operate against Hezbollah if the need arises. Ben Yishai criticized the new defense minister for his lack of understanding of the current situation after Israel Katz announced that elimination of Hezbollah is one of the objectives of the war. 'What he should have said was that Israel must demand that Hezbollah is relieved of its heavy weapons south of the Litani River,' according to Ben Yishai. He said when Lebanese villagers return to the south, Hezbollah operatives, many who are themselves residents of those villages, will return with them. What must be prevented is Hezbollah's ability to rebuild its infrastructure under the homes in those villages. The IDF operation caused the destruction of over 60% of the homes in the villages because they were used as launch pads for attack or had tunnels and fortifications build bellow them where Hezbollah sored their massive arsenal or rockets and missiles.

Rocket alert sirens sound in Avivim, Upper Galilee		https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkvae6og1g	2024-11-18T04:45:00-08:00	
This is Iran's next supreme leader, Ali Kamenei's 2nd son	Reports from Tehran suggest that Mojtaba Khamenei, the second son of Iran’s current supreme leader, was secretly chosen to succeed his father following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi, previously considered the frontrunner Mojtaba Khamenei, 55, the second son of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has reportedly been secretly chosen as his father’s successor, according to a report by opposition-affiliated news outlet Iran International. The report published on Sunday suggests Mojtaba could assume the role even before his 85-year-old father’s death, as the elder Khamenei is rumored to be gravely ill. The supreme leader is traditionally selected by the Assembly of Experts, an 88-member clerical body elected every eight years by the public but vetted by the Guardian Council, whose members are directly or indirectly appointed by the supreme leader. Speculation over Khamenei’s successor intensified in May after a helicopter crash involving former President Ebrahim Raisi, who had been considered the frontrunner for the role. While Raisi had not denied ambitions for the position, the crash is believed to have altered the political landscape. A powerful but controversial figure Mojtaba Khamenei, a cleric like his father, was born in Mashhad and is married with two children. He is a shadowy figure with significant influence among his father’s loyalists. Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the family moved to Tehran, where Mojtaba attended a high school for children of the leaders of the revolution. His father’s political rise culminated in his presidency in 1981. Mojtaba served in the Iran-Iraq War during the 1980s, forging ties with individuals who would later become prominent figures in Iran’s security apparatus, including Hossein Taeb, a senior official in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Over the years, Mojtaba has drawn international attention. In 2019, the United States accused him of collaborating closely with the IRGC and the Basij, a paramilitary volunteer force under the IRGC, to further his father’s destabilizing regional ambitions. Domestically, Mojtaba has faced allegations of suppressing dissent. In 2009, he backed Taeb, then the Basij commander, in the violent crackdown on Green Movement protesters. He was also targeted by demonstrators during the protests sparked by the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, who died in custody after being detained by the morality police for allegedly failing to properly wear her hijab. Critics in Iran argue that Mojtaba lacks the religious credentials and managerial experience to succeed his father. Some clerics and commentators have dismissed the idea of dynastic succession as un-Islamic, likening it to monarchy. While Mojtaba is seen as a leading candidate, other figures have been mentioned as possible successors, including cleric and politician Mohammad Mehdi Mirbagheri and cleric Ali Reza Arafi. Former President Hassan Rouhani and Sadeq Larijani, the former judiciary chief, have also been named as having ambitions for the role. The reliability of the Iran International report is unclear. The outlet, which broadcasts in Persian and has ties to Saudi Arabia and Iranian opposition groups, often focuses on anti-regime narratives. However, the secrecy surrounding succession planning in Tehran makes the situation opaque. Analysts suggest the IRGC will likely work to block any candidate it deems unsuitable.

Palestinian NGO to ask UK court to block sending F-35 parts to Is...	Britain is allowing parts for F-35 fighter jets to be exported to Israel even though they could be used in breach of international humanitarian law in Gaza, lawyers for a Palestinian rights group told a London court on Monday. West Bank-based Al-Haq, which documents alleged rights violations by Israel and the Palestinian Authority, is taking legal action against Britain's Department for Business and Trade at London's High Court. Al-Haq's case comes after Britain in September suspended 30 of 350 arms export licenses, though it exempted the indirect export of F-35 parts, citing the impact on the global F-35 program. Al-Haq argues that decision was unlawful as there is a clear risk F-35s could be used in breach of international humanitarian law. A full hearing of Al-Haq's legal challenge is likely to be heard early in 2025.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj4ssn00m1g	2024-11-18T03:39:34-08:00

Hezbollah demands changes to proposed cease-fire deal	Terror group rejects terms including German, UK participation in commission overseeing implementation of agreement; Lebanese outlet opposing Hezbollah says commission to have vast authority over Lebanon's airport, sea ports and borders Hezbollah is demanding modifications to the cease-fire agreement being negotiated by U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein, local media reported on Monday. According to the Hezbollah-affiliated al Akhbar newspaper, the Iran-backed terror group submitted its response to the proposal to Lebanon's Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and care-taker Prime Minister Najib Mikati. The newspaper claimed Israel was hoping that Hezbollah would reject the deal so that the war could continue. Sources told al Akhbar that the wording of the Lebanese response to Hochstein is nearing completion and will be delivered to the American embassy in Beirut ahead of the envoy's expected arrival on Tuesday. 'The positive ambiguity is Lebanon's way to deal with the American proposal,' sources reportedly said. The questions that were expected to upend the negotiations were resolved and there is a wide birth left. 'The negotiations became serious and Netanyahu was under doubled pressure to stop the fighting,' according to the report. Political sources told the publication that Hezbollah's response was in line with the 2006 UN resolution 1701 and that Hochstein will not announce an agreement during his visit and will only relay the Lebanese response to the Israelis. But officials in Lebanon believe that even if a deal can be agreed, there would be difficulties in implementing it. Hezbollah rejected the participation of Germany and the UK in the committee overseeing the implementation of the cease-fire deal but agreed to American and French involvement. 'This is a critical week, there will either be a cease-fire agreement within days or the fighting would continue until mid-January,' the officials said, referring to the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Western officials said they believe the 'positive openness in Lebanon will help pressure Israel to implement the deal.' According to the Lebanese daily Nidaa al-Watan (Call of the Nation), which does not support Hezbollah, the pending deal delivered to Lebanon includes: • The establishment of an international commission to oversee the implementation of UN resolution 1701, headed by an American general and with the participation of a French general. • The demolition of Hezbollah military structures north and south of the Litani River. • Preserving Israel's right to intervene in case of violations of the agreement that cannot be resolved in negotiations. • Implementation of the deal either through dialogue or through force. The newspaper also reported Berri's response may not be a resounding yes or no, which would not be enough for the Americans or the Israelis, who insist on a positive Lebanese response, and that even if a cease-fire is agreed upon, there would be complications as a result of the agreement and the difficulties would continue. The Al Joumhouria newspaper, which opposes Hezbollah, revealed more information about the proposed deal than previously reported, including a Hezbollah withdrawal north of the Litani while the IDF would withdraw its troops from south Lebanese villages, the return of displaced civilians on both sides of the border and the strengthening of peacekeeping forces and the Lebanese army. The newspaper also reported the establishment of an international commission but said that, in addition to the U.S., France and the UK, an unnamed Arab country also would participate. The commission's authorities will be vast and will include oversight of strategic instillations in Lebanon, including the international airport, the ports and border crossings. The newspaper raises the question of whether the agreement could be reached before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump assumes office, or if there is a risk of a dangerous escalation in the war. It also reports that the initial Lebanese response was already delivered but more comments would be added.

Faith meets diplomacy in Portugal with new Israel Allies Caucus	Madelena Barata: ‘The Jewish people will no longer tolerate being the scapegoat of humanity’ The Portugal Parliamentary Israel Allies Caucus launched on Monday, according to the Israel Allies Foundation (IAF). This is the organization’s 54th pro-Israel parliamentary caucus worldwide. 'The Jewish people will no longer tolerate being the scapegoat of humanity, targeted as a lightning rod for social frustration. Israel stands as the guarantor that no Jew will ever be without defense or a home,' said Madelena Barata, director of the new caucus. 'That's why it's crucial to build networks that support and protect Israel. It is especially significant that the IAF is now active in Portugal, further strengthening this global effort.' These caucuses primarily focus on faith-based diplomacy, engaging Christians and others who support Israel for religious reasons. The Portugal caucus will be bipartisan, led by representatives from two major political parties: Liana Reis of the Social Democratic Party, and Pedra Frazão of the Chega Party. Frazão emphasized Portugal’s support for the Jewish people. 'As a sovereign state, Israel ensures that no Jewish person will be left unprotected or without a homeland,' Frazão said. 'Israel's existence is a deliberate choice, embodying the strength and resilience of the Jewish people and their right to self-defense. This is not just symbolic—it is a steadfast promise to protect every Jew's right to live in peace and security.' MK Sharren Haskel, co-chair of the Knesset Christian Allies Caucus and now Deputy Foreign Minister, attended the caucus launch event in Lisbon. She remarked, 'I view interpersonal diplomacy as a critical tool for building global support for Israel. 'By attending the launch of the Portugal Israel Allies Caucus in Lisbon, we are sending a powerful message of solidarity between our nations,' she continued. 'At a time when support for Israel is more vital than ever, this initiative broadcasts the voices of parliamentarians who stand with Israel. I look forward to thanking the members of the caucus for their commitment to strengthening our bilateral relationship, reinforcing our shared values, and contributing to Israel’s security.' The network of allied caucuses began in 2004 with the Knesset Christian Allies Caucus and expanded in 2006 when the U.S. Congress launched its bipartisan Congressional Israel Allies Caucus, now the largest of its kind. Today, the network spans parliaments on six continents, offering a powerful platform to strengthen ties with Israel. 'IAF Europe is evolving into a movement, acting as a diplomatic 'Iron Dome' protecting Israel from international lawfare,' said Leo van Doesburg, executive director of IAF Europe. 'Our mission is to shift politicians from anti-Israel rhetoric to fact-based dialogue. With our 20th European caucus now in Portugal, we expand our reach across Europe and look forward to strengthening partnerships.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1vvwk00zjx	2024-11-18T00:07:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/18/SJQvmtuMyg/SJQvmtuMyg_92_0_1443_812_0_small.jpg

Iranians divided on election of Donald Trump	Tamar Eilam Gindin: ‘On the one hand, they are afraid of Trump. On the other hand, there is a lot of happiness.’ Iranians are divided over whether the election of U.S. President Donald Trump will be beneficial or detrimental to them. 'On the one hand, they are afraid of Trump,' explained Tamar Eilam Gindin, an Iran specialist at the University of Haifa. 'On the other hand, there is a lot of happiness on social media.' Gindin noted that it’s unclear how much of the optimism comes from Iranians living inside the country versus those living abroad, but she believes there is genuine hope among some Iranians. Khamenei’s Health: Rumors Resurface Gindin also addressed reports about Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's health during an interview with ILTV News on Sunday. She urged caution regarding unverified claims that Khamenei is in a coma or on his deathbed. Fresh rumors about Khamenei’s deteriorating health and the potential transfer of power to his son, Mojtaba Khamenei, last surfaced in early December 2020. As in the past, these claims were quickly denied and ultimately proved untrue. These rumors often originate from a single source that is quick to release scoops but slow to verify them, Gindin told ILTV News, adding that speculation is growing but remains unconfirmed. 'It’s not the first time we’ve heard these rumors. I would not rejoice or worry until we have confirmed reports,' she emphasized. Who Will Succeed Khamenei? If the rumors about Khamenei's health turn out to be true, the question of succession looms large. While many online speculate that Mojtaba Khamenei is the likely successor, Gindin urged caution here as well. She explained that a team of 88 experts, known as the Assembly of Experts, is responsible for selecting the next Supreme Leader. Their meetings and decisions are highly secretive, meaning it is entirely possible that someone else could emerge as the leader.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjlvkk00myg	2024-11-17T23:54:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2020/07/14/r1aMsEiyv/r1aMsEiyv_0_0_640_360_0_small.jpg
Russian former spy warns 'start of WWIII' coming	Maria Butina, now a politician, says she hopes Trump will reverse Biden administration decision to allow Ukraine to use American missiles to attack deep inside Russian territory; 'I guess there are some people in the US who have nothing to lose, don't care' Russian lawmaker and former spy Maria Butina said on Monday that the administration of President Joe Biden was risking World War III if it had allowed Ukraine to use U.S.-made weapons to strike deep into Russia. 'These guys, Biden’s administration, is trying to escalate the situation to the maximum while they still have power and are still in office,' Butina said. 'I have a great hope that (President-elect Donald) Trump will overcome this decision if this has been made because they are seriously risking the start of World War III which is not in anybody’s interest,' she told Reuters. The New York Times reported on Sunday that the Biden administration has made the decision to allow Ukraine to use U.S. weapons to strike deep into Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on September 12 that Western approval for such a step would mean 'the 'direct involvement' of NATO countries, the United States and European countries in the war in Ukraine' because NATO military infrastructure and personnel would have to be involved in the targeting and firing of the missiles. In late October, Putin said that Russia’s defense ministry was working on different ways to respond if the United States and its NATO allies help Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with long-range Western missiles. 'I guess there are some people in the United States who have nothing to lose for whatever reason or who are completely off the grid so much that they simply do not care,' Butina, who spent 15 months in U.S. prison for acting as an unregistered Russian agent, said. Donald Trump Jr., the son of president-elect Trump said in a post on X that the American 'military industrial complex' hoped to start WWIII before his father took office and had the chance to bring world peace. Leonid Eduardovich Slutsky, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Russia's lower house, the Duma, said late on Monday that the American approval of Ukraine's use of the ATACMS missiles to attack deep in Russian territory will result in a severe response and will 'lead to an inevitable escalation that will have a threat of far greater implications.'

Iran backs Lebanon’s decision to secure ceasefire with Israel	Ali Larijani: ‘We support the Resistance (axis) under all circumstances’ Iran has expressed its support for any decision taken by Lebanon to secure a ceasefire with Israel. This was conveyed by Ali Larijani, a senior advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, during a visit to Damascus. Larijani emphasized Tehran's desire to see an end to a conflict that has inflicted significant damage on Hezbollah, Iran's key ally in Lebanon. 'We are not seeking to disrupt anything. We are seeking to resolve issues,' said Ali Larijani, a senior Iranian official. 'Under all circumstances, we stand in support of the people of Lebanon. 'Those who create disruption are [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and those like him. Let us recognize our friends and enemies,' he continued. 'Hezbollah is a wise movement, and the people of Lebanon are also a wise nation. They know what they are doing. 'We support the Resistance (axis) under all circumstances, but they themselves know what actions they need to take,' he concluded. Israeli Strikes Reportedly Hit Iranian Nuclear Facility Meanwhile, Axios has reported that the Israeli Air Force targeted a secret Iranian nuclear research facility during extensive airstrikes last month. Citing current and former U.S. and Israeli officials, the report claims the strikes dealt a significant blow to Iran’s nuclear program. The Parchin military complex, located about 20 kilometers southeast of Tehran, was reportedly the target. This site is believed to have been used for testing explosives necessary to trigger a nuclear device. Iran’s Delayed Retaliation and Khamenei’s Health Concerns Iran has indicated that it will delay its promised retaliation against Israel until after the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in January. Despite the delay, Tehran has vowed that an attack will occur. Over the weekend, the Islamic regime unveiled some of its latest missile and air defense systems. Adding to the tension, unconfirmed social media reports surfaced over the weekend claiming that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's 85-year-old Supreme Leader, is in a coma following a serious illness. Three weeks ago, The New York Times reported that Khamenei was gravely ill, suggesting a succession battle is underway in Tehran. However, no official confirmation has been released regarding the Ayatollah's health. Khamenei was last seen publicly on November 7.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h188addz1g	2024-11-17T23:46:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/14/HJmvKgtUT/HJmvKgtUT_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Families of U.S. victims of Hamas massacre sue Iran	Forty-six American citizens, including children, were killed on October 7, 2023 and 12 others, both living and dead, are still held in Gaza; Lawsuit filed in US District Court cites Hamas documents discovered in Gaza Families of victims of the Hamas massacre on October 7 who hold American citizenship are suing Iran for it part in supporting the deadly attack on Israel. The victims include those who were killed, injured or suffered mental anguish due to the massacre. The lawsuit, filed on Sunday in U.S. District Court in Washington, seeks compensatory damages under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Anti-Terrorism Act, the New York Times reported. It names Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , which all appear on the U.S. list of designated foreign terrorist organizations. Forty-six American citizens, including children, were killed on October 7, 2023. Some 12 Americans were also among the 250 people taken hostage by Hamas. Seven of them still remain in captivity, at least thee who are believed to be dead. More than 30 American Israeli citizens serving in the IDF have been killed in Gaza, and some of their families also are parties to the lawsuit. The lawsuit cites Hamas documents discovered in Gaza, as well as documents obtained by the Americans' lawyers regarding a secret meeting of Hamas leaders in December 2022m, in which Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar requests an additional $7 million a month from the Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps for the 'big project,' referring to the October 7 attack, according to the New York Times, which reviewed the documents. The lawsuit was filed by several lawyers, including Lee Wolosky, and Gary M. Osen, who once represented Nazi victims. Lawsuits are frequently filed against Iran in U.S. courts, and the cases are often won via default judgements.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syvujdumje	2024-11-17T23:18:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/21/H1C9Jlfwa/H1C9Jlfwa_0_216_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham in region to jumpstart Saudi norma...	Graham expected to travel to Riyadh after meeting in Israel with Netanyahu and other officials; Says establishing Saudi-Israel ties vital to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham arrived in Israel for talks with officials. Graham, a close ally of president-elect Donald Trump, plans to travel to Saudi Arabia later as part of his tour of the region. The senator, who touched down in Israel over the weekend, hopes to restart negotiations for a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel that has stalled after the October 7 massacre and the ensuing war, even before Trump takes office, to ensure a two-thirds Senate majority to pass the U.S.-Saudi defense pact. Graham met with former defense minister Yoav Gallant and the two discussed the threat from Iran and normalization with Riyadh. 'It was an important meeting,' Gallant said. 'Lindsey Gram is a true friend and avid supporter of Israel who invests many efforts to strengthen Israel's regional position and bolster its security amid threats primarily from Iran. We discussed the vital need to use the short window of opportunity that has opened for forging agreements that would strengthen Israel and weaken Iran and help reach a path that will enable the return of the hostages held captive by Hamas in Gaza.' Graham met earlier with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Expressing his concern about Iran's breakthrough to nuclear capability, Graham told the prime minister: 'Do whatever you must to prevent the Iranian ayatollahs from obtaining nuclear weapons,' the Prime Minister's office (PMO) reported after the meeting. In Graham's view 'an Iranian ayatollah armed with nuclear weapons is an existential threat to Israel and a nightmare for the world. They consistently refer to the United States as the 'big Satan.'

Lebanon agrees to US cease-fire proposal, says Hezbollah submits ...	Lebanese media says Beirut's response, to be delivered to U. S. envoy Amos Hochstein, will include demands for changes and clarification on American assurances to Israel that it can operate against Hezbollah violations of the deal Hezbollah submitted its response to the cease-fire proposal presented by U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein Lebanon's LBCI channel reported late on Sunday. Hochstein is due to arrive in Beirut as early as Tuesday and receive the official Lebanese position. According to the report, Beirut accepts the outline of the deal but will introduce changes and demand clarifications regarding U.S. assurance to Israel that the IDF would be able to operate in Lebanon should the terms of the cease-fire agreement be violated. Beirut rejects any Israeli operations on its territory. Israel requested a letter from the U.S. ensuring freedom of action against Hezbollah if the Lebanese army or the peacekeeping force that would be deployed to the south fail to respond. If there is progress on an agreement, Hochstein is expected to travel to Israel after his visit to Beirut. According to senior officials who were privy to details of the negotiations, Iran was not expected to prevent Lebanon from agreeing to the cease-fire. 'Iran wants to calm things down. They are playing the long game. To them, there is no problem reaching a deal,' the officials said. Saudi Arabia's Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper cited sources in Lebanon who said that the speaker of parliament, Nabih Berri, kept in touch with Hochstein and his team. 'There is serious concern that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will ultimately reject the deal.' Israel has increased its attacks on Beirut, and on Sunday conducted attacks strikes outside the Dahieh neighborhood, Hezbollah's stronghold in the city. An Israeli official said the attacks are 'a symptom of attempts to finalize the deal.' The IDF confirmed on Monday that it targeted Hezbollah's spokesperson Mohammad Afif. Lebanese media said the target of a later attack was a senior Hezbollah commander of South Lebanon.

Israeli security chiefs warn hostages fate sealed if deal not mad...	Shin, Bet, Mossad, IDF heads say without Israeli concessions talks of a deal cannot restart; Netanyahu summons ministers including far-right opponents of any deal that would end the war, for consultations Israel's top security officials believe there is a need for flexibility in Israel's positions on a possible withdrawal of troops from Gaza and an end to the war, if a hostage deal is to be achieved. Israel has been attempting to re-start negotiations after they have been stalled and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is summoning a consultation on the matter with members of his cabinet including Defense Minister Israel Katz, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. The last two have been vocal opponents of any deal that would end the war and have threatened to bring down the government if one was made. The security officials estimate that of the 101 hostages held in Gaza for over 400 days, only 51 are still alive. They advised the prime minister that if there would be no Israeli concessions, there would be no deal to release them, leaving them to their fate. The renewed efforts come most likely, as winter approached and amid fears that more hostages will die in the tunnels. The efforts are also as the result of regional developments and the election of Donald Trump for a second term as president of the United States. The security chiefs met in the office of the head of Shin Bet Ronen Bar and included Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Mossad Chief Ronen Bar. They also met with Defense Minister Israel Katz and reviewed all available options to restart talks. Israel must first decide its position understanding that Hamas will not agree to a deal that would not end the war and include a full withdrawal of troops. Although Qatar announced it was backing away from mediating between Israel and Hamas, it is still involved behind the scene. Egypt is also actively involved and Israel would have to decide whether to allow Turkey to also be involved in the talks. 1. 2. 3.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1hq11yum1l	2024-11-17T12:42:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/17/rJLjGaDGJl/rJLjGaDGJl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Beirut attack sparks chaos as Israeli missiles hit key targets	Israeli missile attack in Beirut targets vehicle and building, reportedly killing Jamaa Islamiya's Secretary-General and Hezbollah commander; Casualties rise to two dead and 13 injured, prompting school closures Saudi television channel 'Al-Hadath' reported that Israel conducted an attack in Beirut using two missiles, which targeted a vehicle and a building, according to the Lebanese network 'Al-Mayadeen,' affiliated with Hezbollah. In the aftermath, Radio 'Voice of Lebanon' suggested the intended target was likely Mohammad Takoush, the Secretary-General of the terrorist group Jamaa Islamiya. However, this claim was not corroborated by other media outlets. The terrorist organization, according to the Saudi network 'Al-Arabiya,' denied any attack on its center. Meanwhile, the Lebanese channel 'Al-Jadid' said the explosions were due to batteries and electronic devices detonating in a local shop. Initially, the Lebanese Ministry of Health reported one fatality and nine wounded. Separately, 'Al-Hadath' cited sources indicating the attack targeted a 'military commander in Hezbollah.' Subsequent updates from the Ministry revised the toll to two dead and 13 wounded. In response to the attack and amid reports of a high-ranking Hezbollah official's assassination, Lebanon's Minister of Education, Abbas Al-Halabi, announced the closure of educational institutions in several areas throughout the country.

How Netanyahu aid leaked misinformation in security breach	Court lifts ban on suspicions of prime minister's aid and spokesperson's use of classified documents obtained illegally, leaked to German Bild to sway public opinion, while endangering security The magistrate court in Rison Letzion on Sunday lifted some of the gag order on the case involving a possible security breach by a close aid to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Eli Feldstein, who was Netanyahu's liaison to military security reporters was in custody for the past three weeks, suspected of leaking classified documents to foreign media outlets, in a misleading way and endangering national security. Although he was not given security clearance, Feldstein accompanied Netanyahu on visits to sensitive security facilities during the war, including the Air Force command bunker at the IDF’s Tel Aviv military headquarters and was even exposed to classified transcripts from meetings held by the Security Cabinet. According to court filings, in April a reserve soldier serving in a secret intelligence unit gave Feldstein a copy of a classified document via social media, 'so that it would reach the prime minister and assist him in making the right decisions for the hostages.' On August 31, six hostages were executed by Hamas in a tunnel in Rafah. They were Hirsh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Almog Sarusi, Carmel Gat and Alex Lubanov. The brutal murder causd outrage in Israel and prompted a wave of protest against the government and Netanyahu for failing to secure the release of hostages in a deal with Hamas and saving at least some who were to be released in the first phase of the deal that was being negotiated at the time. Therefore, early in September, Feldstein decided to release the document to the Israeli media in order to sway public opinion and portray the protests of the families of hostages, against the government, that had been taking place for the past year, as bolstering Hamas and its leader Yahya Sinwar. Feldstein approached a number of Israeli media outlets. One reporter submitted the document to the military censor who banned its publication. Feldstein then decided to bypass the censor and gave the document to the foreign media. He was assisted by another person to bring the document to publication in the German Bild newspaper. At the same time, he informed Israeli journalists that the story will be published as asked them to do a follow-up report. On September 6 the Bild published a report dealing with the Hamas positions in negotiations to free the hostages, and used documents obtained illegally from IDF intelligence. A few days later, the military launched an investigation into the leak of documents, at the request of Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi. The military found that a document that was sensitive and classified as 'top secret,' was leaked and its publication, the investigators said could harm efforts to achieve the release of hostages which is one of the objectives of the war and could damage IDF and Shin Bet operations in Gaza. Feldstein who saw that the validity of the report in the Bild was under question, met the reserve soldier in the intelligence unit and received a hardcopy of the document and two other documents classified as 'top secret.' One of the documents dealt with 'unusual actions by players in the region at time of war, that could be suspected as targeting Israel.' A joint IDF and Shin Bet investigation led to the leaks being stopped and prevented damage to Israel's security. After the source of the leak was found, further intelligence gathered by investigators, strengthened suspicions against others who were involved. The reserve soldier, two officers and a non-commissioned officer along with Feldstein were arrested late in October and the investigation became public knowledge Netanyahu who at first denied Feldstein was part of the Prime Minister's office later criticized the Shin Bet and the police for mistreating Feldstein and the other suspects who were prevented from seeing council in the fist weeks of their detention. His son Yair, who is active on social media even accused the Shin Bet of staging a coup against his father.

Biden allows Ukraine to use US arms to strike inside Russia	Russia warns move would be seen as a major escalation after deploying North Korean troops; strategic decision may bolster Ukraine's position as Russian forces advance, though future US policy under Trump remains uncertain President Joe Biden's administration will allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided weapons to strike deep into Russian territory, three sources familiar with the matter said, in a significant change to Washington's policy in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Ukraine plans to conduct its first long-range attacks in the coming days, the sources said, without revealing details due to operational security concerns. The White House declined to comment. The move by the United States two months before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20 follows months of requests by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to allow Ukraine's military to use U.S. weapons to hit Russian military targets far from its border. The change follows Russia's deployment of North Korean ground troops to supplement its own forces, a development that has caused alarm in Washington and Kyiv. The first deep strikes are likely to be carried out using ATACMS rockets, which have a range of up to 190 miles (306 km), according to the sources. While some U.S. officials have expressed skepticism that allowing long-range strikes will change the war's overall trajectory, the decision could help Ukraine at a moment when Russian forces are making gains and possibly put Kyiv in a better negotiating position when and if ceasefire talks happen. It is not clear if Trump will reverse Biden's decision when he takes office. Trump has long criticized the scale of U.S. financial and military aid to Ukraine and has vowed to end the war quickly, without explaining how. Still, some congressional Republicans have urged Biden to loosen the rules on how Ukraine can use U.S.-provided weapons. Russia has warned that it would see a move to loosen the limits on Ukraine's use of U.S. weapons as a major escalation.

Mother shielding her baby: Harrowing brutality in Jaffa light-rai...	Prosecutors reveal account of deadly terror attack on Jaffa light rail, where seven were murdered; indictment exposes the calculated cruelty targeting innocent civilians, including a mother sacrificing herself shielding her baby from gunfire An indictment was handed down on Sunday against Ahmad Himuni, a 25-year-old from Hebron, for his role in the deadly attack at the Jaffa light rail station on October 1, where seven people were killed. Muhammad Mask another terrorist was killed on the scene. The indictment details 'particular cruelty' on Himuni's part, who used a knife to stab passengers and bystanders, while Mask, who was neutralized, opened fire with an M-16 assault rifle. The victims in the attack which coincided with Iran's ballistic missile assault, were Ionas Karussis (26), Inbar Segev-Vigder (33), who was shot dead while protecting her baby, Ilia Nozadze (42), Nadia Kosolenko (40), Shahar Goldman (30), Victor Shimshon Green (33), and Revital Bronstein (24). Eleven others were injured. Mask, the 19-year-old terrorist, used a standard rifle in the attack and was neutralized by a passerby, while Himuni was injured and subdued. The Jenin Brigade's refusal and infiltration with a Hebrew-Labeled bag The indictment, filed by attorneys Asaf Shavit and Ori Goldstein from the Tel Aviv District Attorney's Office, charges Himuni with seven counts of aggravated murder as a terrorist act in concert and 12 counts of attempted murder as a terrorist act in concert, along with illegal entry into Israel and weapons transport for terrorist purposes. According to the indictment, Himuni conspired with Mask to carry out terrorist attacks in Israel, motivated by nationalist-ideological reasons, possibly as retaliation for the war in Gaza. As part of their plan, the two terrorists attempted to join the 'Jenin Brigades' to receive weapons and guidance on carrying out terrorist acts against Israeli targets. However, they were told that due to military pressure, this was not possible at the time and that contact would be made after Israeli forces left Jenin. The indictment names two additional terrorists, Abd al-Rahim Afif Jodat Himuni and Ahmad Rafiq Muhammad Himuni, who were in contact with both terrorists and sought to join them in the Jenin Brigade. According to the indictment, the two were informed by Himuni and Mask of their original plan—to carry out a mass-casualty attack in a crowded location such as a football stadium. The agreement among the four was to head to Tel Aviv-Jaffa, with each armed with a firearm. Days before the attack, Mask informed the others (Afif and Rafiq) of his ability to purchase an M-16 rifle, and they helped him financially to acquire the weapon. On September 30, the day before the attack, Mask bought the rifle from an unidentified individual, and when he offered Afif and Rafiq to join the attack armed only with knives, they refused, stating they would participate once they obtained firearms. The Trip to Bloomfield and the altered Plan Himuni agreed to join Mask, armed with a knife, and they infiltrated Israel on the day of the attack. They used the transportation services of other drivers who have already been indicted, carrying a backpack with Hebrew writing containing the disassembled weapon and magazines, along with a pouch (a small bag attached to the belt) with two knives and bullets for the weapon. According to the indictment, upon arriving near Bloomfield Stadium, the terrorists asked a taxi driver who brought them there if a football game was scheduled for that evening. The taxi driver replied that due to the war and the expected Iranian missile attack that evening, no game would take place. The indictment states that around 5:30 PM, the terrorists arrived at Hever HaLeumim Street and stayed briefly in a garage. During this time, Himuni wrote a will on his mobile phone, assuming he would die in the attack. Around 6:30 PM, the terrorists left the garage with their bags and walked toward Jerusalem Boulevard, intending to carry out the attack, where they entered a mosque and prayed. After finishing the prayer, they assembled the weapon in the mosque's purification room, took the knives from the pouch—Himuni holding one in his hands and Mask holding another. Mask then stood at the entrance to the mosque's prayer hall, with Himuni beside him, shouting to the worshippers not to leave the mosque or they would be harmed. Shortly after, around 7:00 PM, the terrorists noticed the light rail arriving at the boulevard and ran from the mosque entrance toward the platform—Mask with the weapon and Himuni with the knife. When the train stopped at the platform, Mask began shooting at dozens present, first on the platform and then inside one of the cars, while Himuni simultaneously stabbed some of the victims. 'The terrorists acted with particular cruelty, seeing the place was crowded with people, including the elderly, women, and children (some toddlers),' the indictment states, 'despite the cries of the minors, who saw the severe injuries inflicted on their mother by the gunfire as she protected them during the shooting.' Upon entering one of the cars, the terrorists noticed Inbar Segev-Vigder, who was protecting her nine-month-old son, strapped to her in a carrier. 'Despite this, the terrorists shot her in cold blood,' the indictment states, noting the indiscriminate nature of their shooting. Bystander's heroism During the shooting, the rifle jammed, and the terrorists entered a barbershop on the street, where Mask cleared the rifle. 'The defendant noticed a person and asked if he was Jewish or Arab, and when he replied that he was Arab, he was allowed to escape. After clearing the rifle, the two returned toward the light rail, which began moving from the platform, and Mask resumed shooting into it through its windows with Himuni beside him. These shots hit passengers in the car and posed a real danger to the lives of additional people beyond those injured,' the indictment states. Further described, the two terrorists noticed a person on an electric scooter and demanded he identify as Jewish or Arab. When he did not respond, Himuni attempted to murder him, stabbing him twice in the back and waist. The indictment emphasizes that the terrorist did this because of the victim's Judaism—who started running and managed to escape. At this point, an armed passerby noticed them, and according to the indictment, Himuni attempted to stab him as well—but he managed to shoot and neutralize him, while others neutralized the terrorist Mask. Today's indictment joins a precedent-setting case filed about two weeks ago against Muhammad Abed al-Nabi (31), owner of 'Hamudi Transport' Ltd. in East Jerusalem, who instructed his drivers to transport illegal infiltrators into Israel during the war. 'Due to his gross negligence, the two terrorists infiltrated the country,' it was reported. Additionally, an indictment was filed against two drivers, Kazem Muzafer (31) and Yazan Nashashibi (35), who transported the terrorists to carry out the attack, charging them with seven counts of negligent homicide and serious injury offenses. These three defendants are also charged with transporting foreign residents under aggravated circumstances in concert. The prosecution requested the court to order the detention of the terrorist and the three additional defendants involved in the attack until the end of legal proceedings against them. In the detention request, the prosecution emphasized that 'this is a bloodthirsty terrorist who murdered young people for nationalist reasons, including a mother protecting her infant on the train. With a rifle and a knife, he slaughtered innocent, defenseless civilians until he was neutralized on the scene.'

Hochstein to return to region to advance cease-fire deal, report	The U.S. envoy is expected in Beirut on Tuesday to receive Lebanon's response and deliver it to Israel, according to reports in Saudi press; Sources tell outlet expectations are not high and Iran has yet to weigh in U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein is expected to return to the region on Tuesday for meetings in Beirut, after Hezbollah responded to the proposed cease-fire agreement presented to the Lebanese government last week. According to the Saudi Al Hadath channel, Hochstein will deliver the response to Israeli officials. The outlet said that expectations that a deal to end the fighting and return residents of Israel's north to their homes, are low because the official Lebanese response does not have the blessing of Iran. 'The wording of the cease-fire agreement is good but indicates that Israel emerges victorious and that will not be accepted. According to Hezbollah, the American proposal requires serious and prolonged discussions and could be a basis for an agreement,' sources told Al Hadath. According to the outline agreed by Israel and the U.S. the main terms of the emerging arrangement include Hezbollah's withdrawal north of the Litani River, deployment of the Lebanese army in the country's south and prevention of weapons smuggling and deliveries from Syria. Israel also insisted on assurances in a side document to be attached to the deal, that would ensure the IDF would be able to operate inside Lebanon if the terms of the agreement are violated by Hezbollah and the Lebanese army or the international peace keepers do not take measures to strop them. Lebanon has said they would not agree to any Israeli military action in its territory and insisted that there would be no additions to the 2006 UN resolution 1701 which Hezbollah ignored.

Pope suggests probe into Gaza war and claims of 'genocide'	In a bold move, Pope Francis urges the international community to scrutinize Israel's actions in Gaza, suggesting they may align with 'genocide' criteria, marking his most pointed critique yet of Israel's prolonged military campaign against Hamas Pope Francis has suggested the global community should study whether Israel's military campaign in Gaza constitutes a genocide of the Palestinian people, in some of his most explicit criticism yet of Israel's conduct in its year-long war. In excerpts published on Sunday from a new forthcoming book, the pontiff said some international experts say 'what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide'. 'We should investigate carefully to assess whether this fits into the technical definition (of genocide) formulated by international jurists and organizations,' the pope said in the excerpts, published by Italian daily La Stampa. Israel has denied all accusations of genocide. The Israeli foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the pope's remarks. Last December South Africa filed a case against Israel at the International Court of Justice for allegedly violating the Genocide Convention. In January the judges at the court ordered Israel to ensure its troops commit no genocidal acts. The court has not yet ruled on the core of the case - whether genocide has occurred in Gaza. Francis, leader of the 1.4-billion-member Catholic Church, is usually careful not to take sides in international conflicts, and to stress de-escalation. But he has stepped up his criticism of Israel's conduct in its war against Hamas recently. In September, he decried the deaths of Palestinian children in Israeli strikes in Gaza. He also sharply criticized Israel's airstrikes in Lebanon as going 'beyond morality'. Francis has not previously described the situation in Gaza as a genocide in public. But last year he was at the center of a messy dispute after a meeting with a group of Palestinians at the Vatican, who insisted he had used the word with them in private, while the Vatican said he had not. The Vatican did not offer comment about Francis' most recent remarks, but its news website reported on Sunday about the book excerpts, including the genocide comment. Last week Francis met at the Vatican with a delegation of former hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, who are advocating for the release of family members and others still being held.

IDF names two fallen troops in northern Gaza battle	Captain Yogev Pazy, 22, and Staff Sergeant Noam Eitan, 21 fell during a clash in Jabaliya, and in the incident another soldier sustained serious injuries The IDF reported on Sunday that Captain Yogev Pazy, 22, from Giv'ot Bar, and Staff Sergeant Noam Eitan, 21, from Hadera, fell during combat in the northern Gaza Strip. The troops were part of the Nahshon Battalion of the Kfir Brigade and fell in a clash in Jabaliya. During the incident, another soldier sustained serious injuries. Pazy is the nephew of former Chief of Staff Gadi Eizenkot who's son, Gal was also killed in the war. On Saturday the military reported that Sergeant Ori Nisanovich, 21, from Jerusalem, a soldier in the Golani Brigade's 13th Battalion, fell during combat in southern Lebanon. Since the start of the war, 797 soldiers have fallen in battle.

Netanyahu, Mossad chief to meeting about 101 remaining hostages	Amid Mossad Chief David Barnea’s efforts to spearhead Israeli initiatives to reignite negotiations for a deal with Hamas, a critical discussion will be held on the fate of the 101 hostages who have been in Hamas captivity for 408 days Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Mossad Chief David Barnea will meet on Sunday for consultations on the 101 hostages held by Hamas for 408 days. Barnea will lead the meeting against the backdrop of his efforts to jumpstart negotiations, bypassing intermediary states. So far, Hamas has rejected all proposals for a hostage deal and remains adamant about its demands for a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a total cease-fire. Ahead of International Children's Day this week, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum dedicated a rally held Saturday in Tel Aviv to the children affected by the ongoing crisis. The event honored those who have returned from captivity, those still awaiting the return of their parents, and especially the two young Bibas siblings, Ariel and Kfir, who remain in Hamas captivity. Ofri Bibas Levy, the aunt of Ariel and Kfir, spoke at the rally: 'I want to cry on your behalf the way children shout, 'It’s not fair.' It’s not fair that all the other children have returned, but you are still there. It’s not fair that you 'celebrated' holidays and birthdays in captivity. It’s not fair that you haven’t jumped in puddles, gone to the pool, or played at the beach. It’s not fair that you didn’t start preschool. 'It’s not fair that you haven’t hugged your father, Yarden, for 407 days. It’s not fair that you’ve had to be strong for your mom, Shiri. It’s not fair that you lost your grandparents, Yossi and Margit. It’s not fair that you said goodbye to your dad in a shelter, witnessing and enduring things no child in the world should ever experience.' Avital Dekel Chen, the wife of hostage Sagui Dekel Chen, also shared her emotional story: 'Last week, I took my daughters on a three-day vacation. Amid all this pain, I must create moments of joy for them. In one store, my 7-year-old daughter, Bar, came to me and said, 'Mom, look, I found a little chair. Maybe you can buy it for me so I’ll have something to sit on at the rallies?’ 'A 7-year-old who wants a chair for rallies calling for her father’s release, as he waits in Hamas tunnels. And if that’s not heartbreaking enough, my 3-year-old daughter, Gali, hums every day with a half-smile, 'Everyone, now.' A 3-year-old singing about redeeming hostages for her father. 'So, for anyone who still doesn’t understand my reality: I am at war. One war is for the return of Sagiv, the love of my life since I was 14 and the father of my children. The second war is for the souls of my daughters.'

It's euphoric': We took part in a cacao ceremony	Ynet reporter joins group taking part in ancient tradition connecting body and mind via the making and drinking of hot cocoa alongside mediation, dance and music The participants, most in their twenties, sit on comfortable cushions around the host. Atop a local stand, intriguing ethnic musical instruments are displayed and after one final stir of the dark liquid in the pot, the cacao ceremony finally begins. After a long, difficult, and sorrowful year, I came to experience a cacao ceremony on a friend’s recommendation at the Guna House, 'a home for spirituality, mind-body connection and consciousness development' in Herzliya. 'The cacao ceremony is a very ancient ritual that dates back thousands of years to regions in Central and South America. For millennia, it’s been used in two main ways: in ceremonies connecting to the heart and in deep meditation practices,' explains Daniel Taler, instructor for growth and healing processes and the person leading my first cacao ceremony, while stirring the brewing cacao, as the intoxicating aroma of chocolate cake fills the air. 'Cacao is gentle and not as aggressive as other psychedelic plants. Its chemical components help release serotonin and endorphins, making us feel much better. It also affects heart function and blood flow, inducing a euphoric sensation,' he added. Taler has been studying traditional South American cultures for years. 'I spent two summers with the Kogi, an indigenous tribe in northern Colombia. I’m writing about their perceptions of health and illness and their traditional medicine.' The workshop encompasses the entire ceremonial process, from preparing the cacao to guided drinking. 'We start with physical and mental preparation, as participants are asked to focus and set their personal intentions.' 'During the workshop, I guide participants through breathing exercises, meditation and dance, allowing them to connect with themselves more deeply. The cacao serves as a catalyst for this process, fostering an experience of inner connection and release,' Taler adds. 'It’s best to come with an open mind and a willingness to find a new experience. It’s also recommended to arrive on an empty stomach so the cacao can truly take effect. The impact won’t be felt on a full stomach,' he explained before the ceremony began. 'During the workshop, we drink the cacao in silence, smell it, taste it and engage all our senses. The cacao is intentionally unsweetened and sugar-free — pure and organic,' Taler says. 'I want everyone holding the cup to cradle it with both hands, close to their chest, near their heart and not drink immediately. Feel the warmth of the cup, start smelling it and breathe into the experience.' I had planned to down half the pot right away and immediately enjoy all the mood-enhancing, energy-boosting and passion-stimulating properties, but back in reality — the workshop's atmosphere is tranquil, the cacao drink carries a comforting aroma of distant childhood memories and the taste is bitter and intense. 'When drinking cacao, it often feels a bit bitter, a bit thick and more challenging to swallow. It's not like chocolate or a sweet cocoa drink. The act of smelling it and the difficulty in swallowing forces me to be fully present as I bring it into my body. 'This presence allows me to truly feel the sensations it creates, making it much easier to turn inward. The sensation is one of focus and softness, combined with insights and a connection to the body,' Taler explains. 'The effect of cacao varies significantly from person to person when it comes to sensations. The cacao experience alone isn't enough; it's paired with guidance, movement, meditation or sounds.' Slowly, I finish my first cup, surprised at how quickly I can shed my cynicism and really connect to the process. With the second cup — which I couldn't finish — I felt myself entering a very gentle, embracing experience. The lighting is dim and soothing to the eyes. Following the guidance, everyone lies on their backs with closed eyes, letting the cacao do its work. Taler, the guide, moves among the participants, singing an ancient melody in a curious language and skillfully playing traditional Indigenous instruments, including various flutes and a shamanic drum with a single drumstick, producing a mesmerizing sound. I suddenly wake up, feeling my cheeks slightly flushed and needing a split second to remember where I am and who this kind person is, softly singing a quiet melody and fanning me with an Indigenous feather fan gently. The movement and dance phase begins, and we make the most of the precious time gifted by the cacao with precise guidance. Anyone expecting a psychedelic experience would be sorely disappointed — this is a delicate and incredibly pleasant bodily sensation. For a few moments, a fragile feeling of happiness, love and maybe even a hint of optimism washes over me. 'It was amazing. I don’t think it’s something you can really explain in words — you have to experience it,' said Tanya, one of the participants. 'It connects and brings us back to the center of our souls, especially during this tough time we're all going through. The cacao shows us what truly matters in life — love above all.' Another participant shared that she felt the focus Taler described. 'It was as if I had a direct connection to the sensations within me. I felt myself concentrating on the present, unconcerned about what was happening around me. I wasn’t thinking about yesterday or worrying about tomorrow. It was so focused and I’m still under its influence even now. I didn’t expect this; I came with a lot of questions.'

Critics, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said the call was a breach of Western solidarity for the sake of domestic political advantage.The call comes amid signs of growing contact between Western-aligned leaders and the Kremlin, even as Russia makes small but steady battlefield gains in Ukraine's east.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byosadpmje	2024-11-17T04:27:40-08:00

Scenes of destruction following escalation: Hezbollah destroys sy...	Hezbollah rocket scores direct hit on a a Haifa synagogue, destroying it; Haifa residents expressed shock at the extent of the destruction and at the fact that no one was hurt; 'We had a great miracle. Two hours before that we were still praying here in the synagogue' The residents of Haifa have become accustomed to sirens in recent weeks, following the escalation of missile barrages from Lebanon. On Saturday, Hezbollah fired a barrage into Israel and destroyed a synagogue. Watch the footage of the destruction: The old synagogue had been designated for preservation but was thoroughly destroyed in the strike. A nearby synagogue and a kindergarten also suffered extensive damage. Dozens of surrounding apartments were damaged by shrapnel, and many cars were also destroyed. While waiting for Hezbollah's response to the U.S. cease-fire proposal, the IDF continued to attack in Beirut's Dahieh district on Sunday and announced at noon that it had completed another wave of attacks. Arab media released the footage of the IDF attack in Beirut. Last week, the Israeli Air Force increased the scope and intensity of its attacks in Dahieh. On Saturday the IDF reported it completed a fourth wave of attacks there in one day. The Air Force attacked 50 Hezbollah terrorist targets in one week. On Sunday, another wave of attacks was completed, and the IDF spokesperson said that 'all of the military targets that were attacked were deliberately placed by Hezbollah in the heart of the civilian population. This is another example of the terrorist organization Hezbollah's cynical use of Lebanese citizens as human shields.' As in the previous attacks, this time too there were warnings in advance to the Lebanese population, and no deaths were reported in the attacks. 'Before the attack, many steps were taken to reduce the chance of harming civilians, which include gathering preliminary intelligence, accurate observations, and warnings for the evacuation of the population in the area,' the IDF spokesperson noted. At the scene of the destruction in Haifa, residents expressed shock at the extent of the destruction and at the fact that no one was hurt. 'We had a great miracle. Two hours before that we were still praying here in the synagogue. Look what happened to us here,' says Gershon Zaft, one of the oldest worshipers at the 'Avot ve Banim' synagogue that was hit in Haifa. 'It's a great miracle that there are no casualties.' He noted that the synagogue was completely destroyed. 'The missile hit exactly where we pray. It will take a long time to rebuild our synagogue.' The person in charge of the synagogue, Gideon Goldenbar, also said that the restoration would take a long time. 'Part of the missile hit the synagogue directly, the destruction is extensive. We hope that we will be able to get some Torah scrolls out.' Haifa town representatives arrived at the scene on Sunday and began collecting evidence, along with property tax representatives who go through the many apartments and help residents whose property has been damaged to fill out the necessary forms to receive compensation.

Where did Dana go? Three days in Mexico turns into 17-year-old ni...	Israeli Dana Rishpy's family says she arrived for a short trip to Mexico from the United States in 2007, three days before she disappeared without a trace On the night of March 30, 2007, 25-year-old Dana Rishpy disappeared during a short trip to Mexico. What was meant to be a 10-day vacation turned into one of the most troubling mysteries involving missing Israelis abroad. Seventeen years later, her family is still searching for answers. 'Dana was strong-willed from a young age, with a unique personality,' says her sister, Dalit Rishpy-Tor, 57. 'She was a beautiful woman who starred in ads, but beyond her exterior beauty, she had a special soul. Talented in animation and voiceover, she loved music and knew countless bands and musicians.' 'She chose to become a vegetarian from a young age, was sensitive to animal rights and picked up running in a sports team. She released a song, directed a music video and was filled with passion for creativity,' she added. A spontaneous decision that changed everything Dana hadn’t originally planned to visit Mexico. 'Dana traveled to the United States for a month to explore animation studies,' Dalit recalls. 'In Los Angeles, while staying with relatives, she saw an ad in a newspaper for a deal to Cancun and Mayan sites. She had a return ticket to New York a week after she disappeared.' Rishpy, who held both Israeli and German citizenship, arrived in Cancun on March 26. On March 28, she sent her family what would be her last email: 'I landed in Cancun and arrived at a really nice hostel,' she wrote. 'I’ve met some very nice people – two French guys and a German. I went out with the German one to explore Cancun’s stunning beaches.' She attached several photos and showed no signs of distress in her writing. Two days later, on March 30, Rishpy boarded a bus to the town of Tulum. At the Playa del Carmen station, three men joined her and began talking to her. Upon arriving in Tulum, one of them, an American named Matthew Walshio, invited her to leave her belongings in a room he had rented at the Caribbean Sea hotel. The three men suggested she join them at the Mezzanine club, where a performance was scheduled for that evening. About two weeks after Dana’s disappearance, her parents – who were traveling through national parks in Argentina at the time – received a mysterious email from Walshio. 'He wrote that Dana’s bags were with him in a hut on the beach, that she had woken up in the morning, said she was going to see the Mayan ruins and never returned,' Dalit recalls. She received the news in the middle of her 40th birthday celebration. Three suspects, no answers A detailed journal documented her life and final days in the bag Dana left behind. Through its pages, vital details about the men she encountered came to light. Among them, Matthew Walshio’s profile emerged as particularly troubling. The investigation revealed his criminal past, which included drug trafficking and rape accusations. Days after Dana’s disappearance, realizing he was being looked for, Walshio hurriedly flew back to the U.S. The second suspect, Oscar Granelli, a Norwegian citizen, was seen on club security cameras sitting with Dana during the performance. According to testimony from an Israeli tourist present, Granelli was seen leaving the party with Dana at 1:30 a.m., with his arm around her shoulder, saying, 'Come on, baby.' Granelli, believed to be the last person to see Dana, now also lives in the U.S. Meanwhile, their friend, Gary Almedal, stayed in Mexico and settled in Tulum. Determined not to give up, Dana’s family hired private investigators who managed to locate photos from the party and focused suspicion on the three men. However, the gathered evidence – photos from the event and testimonies from Israeli witnesses – were never pursued by the local police, who dismissed the findings, claiming they were obtained privately. The FBI’s involvement was limited to a brief conversation with Walshio, who chose to remain silent. The Norwegians were never questioned due to a bureaucratic error after they were identified as Swiss in Dana’s journal. The family used every possible avenue – working with the Foreign Ministry, military attachés, insurance teams and law enforcement. They appealed directly to the then-foreign minister, involved Interpol and immediately provided DNA samples. Searches were conducted with the help of police dogs, flyers were distributed and billboards were put up. They reached out to the governor of Mexico, the president, Jewish communities, Israeli companies and businesspeople. Yet, nothing yielded results. In September 2013, six years after Dana’s disappearance, the family thought there might be a glimmer of hope. The Israeli consul and a Defense Ministry attaché met with the head of the Mexican federal police’s missing persons unit, Salomon Baltazar. 'Police in Mexico aren’t really a proper police force,' Dalit says. 'Thousands of people disappear there every day and they couldn’t understand why we were making such a fuss. Each time a body was discovered in the area, the pain resurfaced. 'Some people said they’d seen or heard something, but there was never anything concrete. What’s more, Dana was there for such a short time before disappearing that not many people had the chance to meet her. A year later, a terrible storm hit the area and everything was affected. It’s a place where you could make an entire country disappear.' The family left behind 'My sister and I asked for Dana for my 15th birthday,' Dalit recounts. 'Because of our age gap, I treated her as a mother would.' This special connection carried on, and in 2008, a year after Dana’s disappearance, both Dalit and her sister gave birth to their third child. 'We experienced crises as a family because everyone reacts differently,' she adds. 'I answered emails, gave interviews to the media and approached every important person I could. My sister is more introverted and my brother lives in Spain. My parents, their suffering is indescribable. They have four children and suddenly one of them is gone.' Seventeen years later, the pain and hope remain intertwined. 'If there’s ‘closure,’ you know it was just ‘bad luck,’' Dalit says. 'But without closure, you see someone who reminds you of her and think, ‘Wow,’ or you dream about her or hear about people who returned home after years.' The void is particularly intense on certain dates, such as the day of Dana’s disappearance, or her birthday at the end of May. 'We think about how old she would be now, what she could’ve achieved. When her friends get married or have children, when the kids mention her and ask about her. The loss is in how we carry on while she’s not here.' The latest trigger was on October 7. 'The uncertainty hostages’ families are experiencing is maddening and I’m doing everything I can to support them,' Dalit says. 'Not knowing what happened to their child, their sibling, or loved ones is a nightmare for them.' Never giving up hope Dana’s absence is deeply felt and doesn’t fade, even after 17 years. 'There’s no way she disappeared willingly,' Dalit declares. 'She loved life, she loved her parents dearly, lived with them and didn’t want to leave. She adored her nieces and nephews. She had plans to study. She only wanted to take a short trip.' 'There’s always hope, even after all these years and that’s why I’m speaking out,' Dalit says. 'Maybe tomorrow someone will see this article and remember spotting a confused girl in Mexico who didn’t know who she was.' She pauses, and adds, 'I’m not naïve or imagining things, but there’s still this hope that one day a miracle will happen and she’ll show up. She could’ve had a brilliant future – professionally, personally, and as a mother and aunt. She had her whole life ahead of her.' 'She encountered the wrong people in the wrong place and was too innocent to see the danger,' Dalit says. 'There were times I imagined, even dreamed, that she returned and I hugged her. Unlike other families who experienced crises, there was no crisis here — she was just stepping into life, into independence, with the whole world ahead of her. She only had to choose.'

President's office said in official statement that trip to COP29 was canceled for 'security reasons,' but host Azerbaijan says the real reason is that Turkey refused to allow the Wing of Zion place to pass through its airspace A news website from Azerbaijan that is considered the mouthpiece of the government claims that the real reason President Isaac Herzog canceled his visit to the climate conference in Baku is Turkey's refusal to allow Herzog's plane to fly in its airspace on the way to the meeting. Azeri officials confirmed the veracity of the local media report to Ynet. Herzog was supposed to arrive in Baku on Tuesday for a visit of only a few hours, and Ynet learned that the flight to Azerbaijan was planned to be made on the country's official Wing of Zion plane. On Saturday night, the president's office announced that 'in light of the situation assessment and for security reasons, the president of the country decided to cancel his trip to the climate conference in Azerbaijan.' Israeli officials stated that it was due to security alerts. The Azeris did not like the way Israel framed the decision, and a senior official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan told the Caliber News website that the reason for Herzog's cancellation was not at all related to security, but to the ban imposed by Turkey on allowing the plane carrying Herzog to use its airspace. 'Unfortunately, intensive negotiations through diplomatic channels that lasted for several days did not yield results. Azerbaijan provides has created appropriate conditions for the participation of all parties in the climate conference, but the situation surrounding the Israeli president's visit arose for reasons beyond our country's control,' the source added. According to him, in Azerbaijan - which has repeatedly hosted major regional and global events such as the Eurovision song contest - a high level of security is guaranteed. 'It is not an exaggeration to say that Baku is one of the safest cities in the world,' the source claimed. 'This is confirmed by the fact that a large number of Israeli officials have come to Azerbaijan, including President Herzog himself, who visited Baku on May 30 of this year. Prime Minister Netanyahu also came to Azerbaijan for a one-day visit in 2016.' He noted that 'unprecedented security measures are also being taken in preparation for the conference in connection with the arrival of tens of thousands of guests and about 100 world leaders and heads of high-ranking delegations to the country.' The Azeris were apparently offended by the Israeli report on the reason for the cancellation, and tried through diplomatic contacts to change its framing. Israeli ministers who arrived in Baku did so on commercial flights through Georgia. It is not clear why Herzog did not choose a similar route, but decided to fly on the Wing of Zion.

One of the suspects arrested on suspicion of being involved in the firing of light bombs at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's house in Caesarea is a senior IDF reserve officer who participated in the protests. The police and the Shin Bet announced earlier that three suspects were arrested for involvement in the attack, and they were transferred for investigation by the Shin Bet and the Israel Police's Lahav 433 unit. The attack took place on Saturday night around 7:30 p.m., while Netanyahu and his family were not at home.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rypi00gpz1e	2024-11-16T22:21:20-08:00	
3 arrested for firing flares at Netanyahu's home	Suspects transferred to joint investigation by the Shim Bet and Israel Police for firing at least two flares at prime minister's Caesarea home, which landed on the property; The prime minister and members of his family were not home at the time Three suspects have been arrested in connection with firing two flares at the Caesarea home of Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday night, the Israel Police and Shin Bet announced Sunday morning. The three suspects were transferred to a joint investigation by the Shin Bet and Lahav Unit 433 of the Israel Police, which said in a statement that 'more details will be provided later, depending on the progress of the investigation' On Saturday night, police officers carried out searches in Caesarea , after the flares were fired around 7:30 p.m., allegedly from the direction of the sea. The prime minister and his family members were not home at the time of the incident. 'It was just like on a soccer field, orange smoke that landed in the yard of the Netanyahu family. The family members were not here, but it was definitely something we did not expect to see, certainly not after the drone shot from Lebanon that hit the front of the house. It's stressful,' a neighbor said. Another nearby Netanyahu neighbor said that 'the prime minister and his family members were not at home at the time of the incident. 'Long before the drone struck the house, they stopped coming here, but this is still a worrying escalation. It's scary, and I hope they capture the culprits who fired the flares.' Last month, a drone launched from Lebanon struck the Netanyahus' home, breaking a window. The incident took place precisely after this week the group Moked Caesarea, which led the demonstrations in front of the Prime Minister's private home for five years, announced the end of the demonstrations there and the transfer of the protest to Jerusalem. The decision was made, according to the group, because 'the time has come to step up,' after they demonstrated in front of the house in Caesarea three times a week - protests that were often accompanied by arguments and even confrontations with the police, which led to arrests and severe violence. The incident was condemned from all sides in the political system, and President Isaac Herzog said afterwards that he had spoken with the head of the Shin Bet. He called the incident 'a highly dangerous event, which I strongly condemn. I have just spoken with the Shin Bet chief and emphasized the urgent need to investigate and address those responsible as quickly as possible.' Herzog stressed that this represents 'a dangerous escalation and noted that the investigation is being carried out with the utmost seriousness. We must not let these flames escalate. I continue to warn against the rise of violence among the public — this is a matter of our very survival.' In a post on X, Israel’s new Defense Minister Israel Katz said that the incident has crossed all the 'red lines.' 'It is not possible for the Prime Minister of Israel, who is threatened by Iran and its proxies who are trying to assassinate him, to be subject to the same threats from home,' Katz said in the X post. In his response to the case, Justice Minister Yariv Levin called for renewed promotion of the judicial overhaul. 'The time has come for full backing to be given to the restoration of the justice system and the law enforcement systems,' said Levin, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister. 'There was no need for flares to be fired at the Prime Minister's house, to understand the seriousness of the rampant violence and the refusal on the part of those who are trying to dismantle the country from within.'

Special weekend for wounded IDF soldiers: 'Inspiring conversation...	From Thursday to Saturday night, wounded soldiers and their families enjoyed a series of unique encounters, including with Paralympic champion Asaf Yasur; Yair, a paratrooper who was critically wounded, expressed his gratitude to the donors Last weekend, 140 wounded IDF soldiers and their families were hosted at a hotel in Jerusalem. From Thursday through Saturday night, they participated in lectures, group activities, a festive Shabbat reception and more. The weekend began with an uplifting and optimistic talk by Asaf Yasur, a world champion in taekwondo and gold medalist at the Paris Paralympic Games. When Asaf was 13 years old, he was electrocuted and lost both of his arms. Despite this tragedy, he resolved to live his life with a passion for success. From the moment he discovered taekwondo, he realized that nothing would hold him back. Another highlight of the weekend was Yair Lipschitz, a deputy company commander in the Paratroopers's 101st Battalion, who serves in the IDF as a career officer and was severely wounded in Gaza. Yair was evacuated in critical condition, placed in a medically induced coma and remained on life support for some time. He shared that only two weeks ago, he underwent another surgery, which he hopes will be the last. Four months ago, Yair became the proud father of a baby girl, Hallel. 'I met others who were wounded like me, and the conversations were truly inspiring,' Yair said. 'The meetings with fellow wounded soldiers who have been on a similar journey, as well as with soldiers from the Netzach Yehuda Battalion, who also spent Shabbat at the hotel, were remarkable. I’m left speechless—kudos to everyone involved in organizing this event.' The weekend was generously funded by David Hager, a Haredi businessman from Los Angeles, in partnership with the Netzach Yehuda organization. The event took place at the Leonardo Plaza Hotel in Jerusalem, part of the Fattal hotel chain. Hager explained that from the beginning of the war he has hosted hundreds of reservist families at various hotels to give them relief from the everyday pressures. 'When I visited soldiers and asked how I could help, almost all of them said they were fine but would love for their families back home to be pampered,' Hager shared. 'As the fighting dragged on and during my visits with wounded soldiers, I realized how important it is for families to help their injured loved ones break away from the routine of rehabilitation.' He also praised the management of the Leonardo Plaza Hotel, particularly the hotel’s director, Ortal.

United Torah Judaism and Likud officials who were involved in Katz's announcement claimed that the minister intended to reduce the number of orders, and when he realized that he had no ability to do, he published that 7,000 orders would be issued. Some 1,000 of the orders were issued Sunday.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rja3tzpgkg	2024-11-16T21:17:08-08:00

Blasts shook Ukraine's capital Kyiv and other cities while neighboring Poland scrambled its air force early on Sunday after the two countries said a Russian missile attack was under way. 'Due to the massive attack by the Russian Federation using cruise missiles, ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles on objects located, among others, in western Ukraine, Polish and allied aircraft have started operating in our airspace,' the operational command of NATO member Poland's armed forces posted on X. Blasts were heard in Ukraine's southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia and the Black Sea port of Odesa, Reuters witnesses said, and Ukraine's air force issued air raid alerts for all of the country., although the scale of the attack was unclear. The air force urged residents to take cover and said a number of missiles, including different types of cruise missile, were flying through Ukrainian air space. Ukrainian officials said they had cut power to a number of regions, including Kyiv, as a preventative step.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjcap11wfye	2024-11-16T21:07:10-08:00	
Reservist Idan Kenan, 21, killed by sniper on outskirts of Jabali...	On October 7 of last year, Kenan posted on social media in a message to residents of the south: 'No one here sleeps until you feel safe. I promise you'; To his grandmother he wrote: 'I know what the risks are and accept it. If the Father in Heaven decided that someone should die for our country that is the greatest honor'; Since the beginning of the war, 796 soldiers have fallen Sergeant First Class Idan Kenan, 21, from Ramat Gan, a soldier in the 90th Battalion, Kfir Brigade, was killed by a Hamas sniper on the outskirts of Jabaliya, near Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip, the IDF spokesman announced on Sunday morning. Since the beginning of the war, 796 soldiers have been killed. Adi Kenan, Idan's mother, announced her son's death in a post on Facebook. 'It is with great sadness that I have to announce the murder of my son, Major General Idan Kenan, by a lowly terrorist in the north of the Gaza Strip. The Lord will avenge his blood.' Linoy, Idan's sister, added that he 'died a hero,' and said: 'I will never forget you, I love you so much and I will miss you so much all my life. May your soul be bound in the bond of eternal life. I can't believe you left me like that and went to the next world my beloved brother, it's just not right that you did it. Hero brother, the kindest boy in the world, how did they take you from me like this? I will never be able to overcome a loss like yours. You are my whole world. Watch over us from above my tzaddik, how much God loves you that he let you go on Shabbat, our own black Sabbath. You will remain etched in the hearts of all of us.' Just a few months ago, Kenan wrote to his grandmother: 'Grandma, I don't know if you heard, but there was an attack in our area, one person was killed and my friends were shot, but thank God they are fine and I am fine. Tomorrow will be the funeral, but the boy's parents don't know yet, so not a word to anyone! Just know that everything is fine. Unfortunately, I didn't get to know him. He was killed for our country and we all understand this, and are happy to be there instead of the citizens and the country we love so much.' 'I want to let you know that, no matter what happens, I always love you the most in the world and know exactly what I'm doing and where I am. I know the risks and what can happen and I'm at peace with that - and even more. This is the path I chose and it's the path I believe every man in our country should choose. There is and will be no one to protect us if not us. We are the people of eternity and unfortunately this eternity will always come with hatred and blood, and if the Father in heaven decided that someone should die for our people - this is the greatest honor in the world. Everyone here protects themselves with 10 eyes and prays for the ascension of his soul, although I'm sure he will go to heaven. I'll probably be there at night until the funeral because I have to help prepare everything. Know that I love you and that we will never be separated,' he concluded. On October 7 last year, Kenan posted on Instagram: 'No one here sleeps until you feel safe. I promise you. Residents of the center and the south, take care of yourselves. We don't have another country.' On Saturday night, the IDF spokesman announced Sergeant Ori Nisanovich, 21, from Jerusalem, a soldier in the Golani Brigade's 13th Battalion fell on Friday during combat in southern Lebanon. Nisanovich was a student at the Avinoam Hesder yeshiva in Evyatar. At his son's funeral Saturday night in the Har Herzl cemetery, Roni, Ori's father, said that 'Ori spoke about the honor of protecting the people of Israel from our enemies, he was not interested in anything except the importance of what he was doing in the IDF. Before entering Lebanon, he called me and I brought up the topic of what could happen; then Ori stopped me and said 'Dad, listen, I'm happy with what I've chosen and I'm not sorry for what could happen'. He called my wife and his sister, and had a similar conversation with them. The second time he entered Lebanon, he also told me, 'If I have to sacrifice myself, that's fine.''

Hitler's book in the living room: IDF commandos operating in Leba...	Ynet reporter joins elite Duvdevan soldiers spearheading the fight against Hezbollah after serving in the West Bank and Gaza; 'We can’t underestimate this enemy' 'The darkness is our ally,' says Lt. Col. A., commander of the IDF Commando Brigade’s Duvdevan unit. He sits on a couch in the middle of a children’s room inside a luxurious Lebanese estate in a village overlooking Israel's northern communities. Around him, his soldiers are fully equipped, carrying ammunition, weapons and specialized gear. The windows are covered and a thick fabric carpet blocks any light entering the room. 'Even the smallest flicker is an immediate threat of anti-tank fire into the compound,' explains one of the soldiers. On the table in the center of the room stands a small projector displaying maps and operational plans on the wall. Conversations are held in hushed tones and the cold is barely noticeable due to the crowded space. The tension and alertness are palpable among the soldiers, who clearly understand where they are. Lt. Col. A. tells me, 'These are Duvdevan soldiers. You're at the deepest point the IDF has set foot in Lebanon. We'll launch the attack from here.' 'I'm living a double life' An hour earlier, we were still at the assembly point, which military censorship restrictions prevent me from specifying. In the convoy of Hummers, we used to enter, we met reservists, some of whom have been serving for over 250 days. They’ve fought in all of the IDF’s active fronts. 'I was in Gaza, fought with the unit in the West Bank and now we've come here,' says a 40-year-old soldier, a married father of two young children who lives in Jaffa and works as an investment manager. 'My wife’s trying to keep the business afloat. It’s tough, but there’s no choice,' he says. When I asked how he copes with so many reserve days in a year, he answered, 'It’s not simple. I’m basically living a double life. These hands hold a weapon one moment, shaking as they fire in all directions and the next moment, they’re bathing my baby in the tub. It’s really hard to explain.' We boarded the Hummers and began our advance. But before that, let’s delve into Duvdevan’s role in the war. Considered one of the IDF's elite units, Duvdevan is part of the Commando Brigade and specializes in counterterrorism, operating in urban and densely populated areas using undercover tactics. For years, the unit has proven itself critical, primarily operating in the West Bank. The soldiers carry out special missions, mastering unique techniques such as rapid movement between tightly packed buildings and operations under high-pressure conditions. On October 7, 2023, the unit operated in the kibbutzim of Kfar Aza and Be'eri before spreading out to other communities on the Gaza border, where they engaged in battles against dozens of terrorists and rescued numerous residents from their homes. The unit then resumed intense operations in their familiar territory — the West Bank. Alongside soldiers from Reserve Unit 6217, they conducted dozens of targeted missions, including eliminating terrorists face-to-face, uncovering and destroying bomb-making factories and an operational command center in the Jordan Valley and cornering terrorists holed up in buildings. The unit eliminated the terror military leader of the village of Tubas and his predecessor in the months prior. They also thwarted numerous attacks including intercepting suspects en route to central Israel. They were responsible for neutralizing a terrorist carrying explosives and weapons as he moved from Jenin set to kill Israelis. After their operations in the West Bank, the unit moved to Gaza, where they conducted missions at AL-Shifa and Nasser hospitals, carried out strikes in Khan Younis and Al-Shati camps, and arrived here a few days ago. 'We found a copy of Mein Kampf' Duvdevan soldiers are now working to clear the area. They operate under the Commando Brigade, deployed across the region and functioning under the 91st Division, commanded by Brig. Gen. Shai Kalper. The late-night drive into the area is conducted without lights. The unit's highly skilled drivers drive at high speeds in close convoy formation to minimize exposure to gunfire. Despite the fog and challenging terrain, they maintain minimal spacing — a true art. We arrived at the house where the unit commander was based. Here, the houses are mansions — multi-story buildings used by Hezbollah terrorists for planting explosives, hiding rockets and storing equipment, all ready for combat. Some locations also include underground infrastructure. As we left the house, we met two soldiers from Jerusalem, who wanted to share what they’d found in some of the buildings. 'At first, we found only pictures of [Hassan] Nasrallah, which is expected. But later, we also found photos of [Ali] Khamenei and other Iranian officers.' 'It’s clear evidence of the connection,' they said. 'In one of the living rooms, we even found a copy of Mein Kampf, Hitler’s book. Parts were underlined and highlighted inside as if someone had studied it line by line. This is Nazism in its rawest and most blatant form,' they added. On the way to the second target, we spoke with H., the unit's deputy commander, who explained the unique challenges the soldiers face. 'There’s no doubt the terrain and type of operations are different from what we’re used to in the West Bank,' he said. 'In the West Bank, the buildings are densely packed and you move through alleys and fight accordingly. Most of the area is flat. The terrain in Gaza is similar. But here in Lebanon, it’s very mountainous and the distance between houses is greater,' he explained. 'We can’t underestimate this enemy' 'You need to move during the day and night while utilizing different methods from those we’re accustomed to. But the unit's soldiers are adept at this. At the end of the day, a soldier is a soldier.' He added, 'We can’t underestimate this enemy called Hezbollah. They adapt to us in real-time. They don’t attack immediately upon encountering us. They observe, gather fragments of information and then launch their assault. This happens during combat, but we adapt as well — and faster.' We reached the second building in the middle of the night. While I can’t detail the unit's special camouflage capabilities, it’s evident how difficult it is to determine if soldiers are inside. 'This is part of our skillset — to integrate ourselves seamlessly into the surroundings,' the unit commander explained at the building’s entrance. 'I also work with tanks here, which isn’t something I have in the West Bank, but you adjust to it quickly. Ultimately, our mission is to clear the village and the extensive firepower capabilities I have here help me achieve that,' he added. Now, we’re boarding the Hummers for the journey back to Israel. The soldiers staying behind will continue their mission of clearing the area. Everyone speaks in terms of existential warfare and history, understanding they’re part of a significant moment for the country. Yet, they have one simple request: 'Let us do our job so the residents of the north can return to their homes as safely as possible.'

Hezbollah-Israel conflict disrupts Syria’s lucrative Captagon tra...	Syria's reliance on Captagon smuggling faces new challenges as the ongoing conflict with Hezbollah threatens to undermine critical revenues for the Assad regime Syria’s illegal drug trade, a critical economic pillar for President Bashar Assad’s regime, is under threat as the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah disrupts the production and smuggling of Captagon, an illicit stimulant wildly popular across the Middle East. The weakening of Hezbollah, a key ally and facilitator in the drug industry, could lead to significant economic repercussions for the Syrian government. The role of Captagon in Syria’s economy Captagon, a brand name for the synthetic stimulant fenethylline, has become a major source of revenue for Syria. The country is currently the world’s largest producer of Captagon, with Syrian drug trafficking reaching nearly three times the value of the combined drug trade of Mexican cartels, according to Syrian economic journalist Samir Tawil. 'The war in Syria has drained many economic resources, leading the regime to seek alternative funding,' Tawil told The Media Line. 'Drugs of all kinds have become the most important economic resource for the Syrian regime and Hezbollah over the past 10 years.' Sanctions and key figures in the drug trade In March of last year, the UK, the US, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals suspected of involvement in the Captagon trade, including two of Assad’s cousins. The Syrian regime, along with Hezbollah—the Lebanese group closely intertwined with the regime—is believed to rely on drug sales to fund military actions. According to the UK, Assad earns around $60 billion annually from drug revenue. During the announcement of its sanctions, the UK asserted that the Syrian regime 'plays a central role in the drug trade, with shipments worth billions of dollars leaving regime-controlled strongholds like the port of Latakia.' The 4th Armored Division and Hezbollah’s involvement The drug trade in Syria is overseen by high-ranking officials and military units, notably the 4th Armored Division led by Maher Assad, the president’s brother, and his deputy Ghassan Bilal. Both have been implicated in facilitating drug production and smuggling. In 2021, during the trial of Hassan Muhammad Daqou, a Syrian-Lebanese drug trafficker known as the 'King of Captagon,' evidence emerged of conversations between Daqou and Bilal discussing smuggling drugs across the Syria-Lebanon border. A source within the 4th Armored Division, speaking on condition of anonymity, revealed that most soldiers are involved in the drug trade. 'The highest authorities provide security cover for those involved, in exchange for absolute loyalty to the Syrian regime,' the source said. Hezbollah’s global drug operations Hezbollah’s involvement in drug trafficking extends beyond the Middle East. In 2002, the arrest of Lebanese citizen Asaad Barakat in Brazil on tax evasion charges unveiled his role in raising funds for Hezbollah through drug trafficking in Latin America. Subsequent arrests included Nemer Zaiter in 2008 for attempting to smuggle cocaine into the US and Hamza Barakat in 2013 for founding a fraud and smuggling network. Dozens more have been arrested on similar charges, highlighting Hezbollah’s global network for funding through illicit means. Iran’s financial support to Hezbollah Hezbollah has long relied on financial and military support from Iran. In the 1980s, Iran provided $100 million annually, increasing to $200 million by 2005 and $300 million from 2006 to 2009. Despite fluctuations due to sanctions and oil prices, recent years have seen Iran’s support stabilize around $700 million annually, especially after sanctions were lifted during the presidencies of Barack Obama and Joe Biden. The Israeli assassination of Syrian businessman Baraa Qatirji on July 15 revealed his involvement in transporting funds from Iran to Hezbollah. Funds were moved by the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) through oil and cash shipments to Syria, sold to a company called 'BS' owned by Qatirji, with proceeds transferred to Hezbollah. Mustafa Al-Naimi, an expert on Iranian affairs, told The Media Line that Hezbollah receives not only financial but also military support from Iran, with members undergoing training in Iran and Syria. He noted that Hezbollah is currently facing significant setbacks due to the loss of fighters in the war with Israel and the disruption of financial routes from Iran via Syria. The Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association Another key financial arm of Hezbollah is the Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association, founded in 1982 with over 30 branches in Lebanon. Operating outside the supervision of Lebanon’s central bank, it is on Israel’s terrorist list, according to The New York Times. Adam Smith, former Senior Advisor to the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), described the association as a 'state within a state' in Lebanon and a primary source of Hezbollah’s funding. The US Treasury imposed sanctions on Al-Qard Al-Hassan in 2007 and expanded them in 2021 to include six employees who funneled over $500 million through Lebanese banks. US Legislative Actions Against the Captagon Trade In December 2022, US President Joe Biden signed the 'Captagon Act,' declaring Syria’s involvement in the drug trade a national security threat. The law targets networks involved in Captagon production and trafficking linked to the Assad regime. Subsequent legislation specifically targeted members of Assad’s family, including Maher Assad and figures from the 4th Armored Division. Impact of the Israel-Hezbollah war on drug trafficking The recent conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has significantly disrupted drug smuggling operations. Jordan and Saudi Arabia have reported a notable decline in drug seizures at their borders over the past month compared to previous years. Political analyst Wael Khalidi noted that drug smuggling is a primary topic in meetings between Jordanian and Syrian officials. 'The last month has seen economic stagnation in the Syrian regime due to the decline in Captagon smuggling, caused by the war between Israel and Hezbollah,' Khalidi told The Media Line. Residents in Damascus have observed a shortage of Captagon supplies, with dealers attributing the disruption to Hezbollah’s involvement in the conflict. Ahmad M., a local resident, said that drug users are having trouble getting their fix due to decreased supply. Calls for international action Khalidi urges stronger international efforts to combat the drug trade originating from Syria. 'Drugs are not difficult to smuggle from Syria to Washington,' he warned. 'The smuggling networks are highly trained and operate in the interests of Hezbollah and Assad.' He emphasizes that leniency shown to Syria, including its reintegration into the Arab League and trade deals under the guise of humanitarian aid, has facilitated the drug trade, especially through the port of Latakia. Entire generations are being lost due to drugs, whether through addiction or trafficking, Khalidi said. The story is written by Rizik Alabi and reprinted with permission from The Media Line.

Police investigate flares fired toward Netnyahu's residence	Security forces search for suspect who fired at least two flares toward prime minister's Caesarea home; Officials condemn incident as 'dangerous' Police officers carried out searches in Caesarea after flares were fired toward Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in the town. The flares are suspected to have been launched from the sea, but the circumstances of the incident are still under investigation, and no suspects have been arrested. According to the Shin Bet and the police, 'Around 7:30 p.m., two flares were identified near the prime minister's home in Caesarea and landed in the yard. Police and Shin Bet forces are on the scene.' 'The prime minister and his family weren’t present at the time of the incident. Israel Security Agency and the Israel Police have launched a joint investigation into the incident. This is a serious event representing a dangerous escalation and the necessary measures will be taken accordingly,' it added. Opposition Leader Yair Lapid said, 'I strongly condemn the firing of flares at the prime minister's home. I expect the police to find those responsible and hold them fully accountable.' President Isaac Herzog called the incident 'a highly dangerous event, which I strongly condemn. I have just spoken with the Shin Bet chief and emphasized the urgent need to investigate and address those responsible as quickly as possible. 'He stressed that this represents a dangerous escalation and noted that the investigation is being carried out with the utmost seriousness. We must not let these flames escalate. I continue to warn against the rise of violence among the public — this is a matter of our very survival.' The police initially reported about a single flare fired, saying that officers already deployed in the area began searches immediately after receiving the report. The officers located 'remains of military equipment consistent with flare use.' A police sapper held an additional examination to rule out any further danger.

Yemen's Houthis say they attacked 'vital target' in Eilat	Yemen's Houthi forces attacked 'a vital target' in Israel's Red Sea port of Eilat with a number of drones, the Iran-aligned terror group's military spokesperson Yahya Saree said in a televised speech on Saturday.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjsqztimjg	2024-11-16T11:33:45-08:00	
They called me a traitor': The Syria-born journalist interviewin...	Hayvi Bouzo, who fled from her home country to the U.S., tells Ynet about her decision to interview Israelis after October 7 and the Arab media's bias against them 'Let’s start from the end,' I say to veteran Kurdish–Syrian journalist, Hayvi Bouzo who, for fear of the authorities, has moved to Washington. Let’s focus on the here and now. For her Yalla website, each week she interviews Israelis – mainly those who lost family members in the October 7 massacre, but there are also other Israelis she feels it’s important to let the Arab world know about. She’s the only Arab journalist who has made this her life’s mission. The numbers show she has somewhere between 750 thousand and one million followers on Yalla. With which Israeli did you instantly find common language, someone who evoked empathy and whom you would like to meet again? Hayvi (in English: Hope) smiles through the screen. 'Lior Raz. Definitely. The hero from Fauda. I interviewed him and enjoyed every minute of it. Let me tell you a secret. I watched all four series of Fauda. I didn’t miss a single episode. It’s a fantastic series. I know they’re working on a fifth series.' 'For me, Lior Raz is the ultimate Israeli,' she says. 'Smart, honest and pleasant, but hard and straight-talking. He also speaks Arabic, earning him extra points as far as I’m concerned. We sat and chatted in Arabic and the conversation flowed. We’re interested in the same things – the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, relations between Israel and the Arab states, and young people in the Arab world. Lior Raz’s episode on Yalla got lots of views in the Arab world.' Which Israeli most touched you? Without hesitating, she answers, 'Yifat Ziller, cousin to Yarden Bibas, held hostage in Gaza. It was so hard. I cried through the whole interview as she talked about Shiri, Yarden and their two wonderful little red-haired children. 'I can’t forget Ariel, who was four when kidnapped, and his brother Kfir who was only nine months old. Before the interview, I looked at some pictures and decided I’d be strong, but my conversation with Yifat broke me. I thought of my own two children, Gino (11) and Talia (8). I told my husband Hans that I couldn’t imagine how I’d keep it together if a disaster as horrific as that ever happened to us.' Bouzo, 41, was born in Damascus into what she describes as an 'unusual' family. 'In our home,' she says 'when Hafez el Assad, Bashar’s father, was in power, and the dictatorship took the liberty of listening in on its citizens, nabbing them off the street, interrogating and torturing them, sometimes to death – my family behaved differently. 'Our home was always open and I always wanted to be a journalist. I’ve been curious about people ever since I can remember, and I fought to break down barriers in the closed environment in which I was raised. At home, I could talk about anything. Outside, I learned to be quiet.' Weren’t you afraid? 'Obviously. We didn’t take to the streets to demonstrate against the government and we didn’t have political conversations with people we didn’t know we could trust. Amongst ourselves, however, and with close friends we talked about everything. 'I was born in Damascus at a time when the state ran its citizens’ lives by brainwashing them, mainly the young people. This means that each and every citizen was destined to be a tool of the regime, and it continues to this day. ' 'People who live in democracies don’t understand the life of a small individual in a dictatorship. I keep thinking about the young people in Syria whose lives are run under enormous fear, and it breaks my heart. 'What would have happened to me if I’d carried on living in Damascus right under the noses of security and intelligence agencies? I’d have either been arrested as I wouldn’t have been able to keep my mouth shut about the regime’s injustices, or I’d have gone underground like lots of my friends did, until they got caught.' What does 'got caught' mean? 'They take you for violent interrogations. The girls, many of whom are virgins, they rape as part of the ’absorption process’ and ruin their lives. And they beat up and torture the men. If they’re lucky, they’ll be released a couple of days later. In other cases, they’ll be transferred to detention and trial, accusing them of God knows what. It’s just terrible.' The Jewish butcher in Damascus Bouzo was raised with stories of her parents’ Jewish neighbors. 'My father would buy the meat from the Jewish butchers in Damascus - because of the meat’s quality, and the shop’s cleanliness,' she recalls. 'They had good very neighborly relations and my mother, who was raised in a Jewish neighborhood of Aleppo, would visit her Jewish neighbors and eat the Jewish food they cooked and took on quite a few of their customs.' 'Everything was very calm and normal and until the Ba’ath party took over, and the Jews in the neighborhood started disappearing. My mother was wandering around in tears knowing she’d never see her Jewish neighbors again. They left everything behind. Very few managed to sell their homes. Some, from what I realized much later, went to the United States, others to the ‘Zionist state’.' Bouzo also moved to the United States with her family, but the family returned to Syria because 'we weren’t afraid.' She started working as a TV presenter for a Syrian state TV channel, relocated to Dubai following a job offer from Orient TV, and returned to Syria to work for El Sham TV, that she describes as 'the first, failed, attempt to set up a private TV channel in Syria. We were forced to closed due to government pressure, because we were disrupting them.' While working at a state radio station in Syria, on one show she mentioned 'totally innocuously, that Jerry Seinfeld’s mother was a Jews born in Aleppo. Out of nowhere, I was flooded with phone calls' she says. 'They shouted ‘Shame on you’ and ‘How can you even think of mentioning the Jewish woman?’. They said horrific things about Israel and cursed me. I explained that I hadn’t meant to bring politics into the show, that I was just stating a fact. It was hinted to me that it was Bashar el Assad’s people who had called to scare me. I was fired from the show two days later. Simply because of Jerry Seinfeld’s mother.' When did you start taking an interest in the Jewish-Arab conflict? 'From a very young age. Around the end of grade school. At our school, they talked about politics a lot, as well as about Jews and the State of Israel.' What does the State of Israel look like from Syria? 'The Syrians look at Israel with an inferiority complex. On official state-run TV channels, there are no representations of Israel apart from it being an enemy country, soldiers, wars, hatred and hostility. There’s no chance of seeing daily life in Israel or of broadcasting a piece by a foreign journalist visiting Israel giving his impression from the street, like you guys do for Syria. 'The regime in Damascus wants Syrians to hate you. And Iran fans the flames. Even coming across the name ‘Israel’ rather than the ‘Zionist entity’ would be a step forward.' And the young people? 'They’re afraid to go out to demonstrate. There’s no ‘fighting spirit’ among the young people in Damascus like there is in Tehran.' I saw pictures of you with Noa Kirel. How was that connection made? I was at a beauty pageant in Eilat along with former Miss Iraq, Sarah Idan, and another journalist from Bahrain and the cameras were constantly on us.' Did it bother you? 'Not at all. I just kept wondering how they’d treat an Israeli woman if she were to show up at an event in Damascus. The discrepancy is enormous. Noa is so sweet and lovely. She knows the work. Although interviewing singers isn’t really my style, I enjoyed it as there’s something very genuine and positive about her. It wasn’t a long conversation, but I was surprised by the thousands of responses after it was broadcast. They wouldn’t admit it, but it looks like they know who Noa Kirel is in the Arab world.' Who was the first Israeli you interviewed? 'It was even before Yalla. While working on Orient, I asked to meet your ambassador, Danny Dannon who responded immediately.' How was the interview with Danny Dannon received in Syria? 'Ah. That I can’t forget. They called me a traitor. I then knew I had no chance of going to Syria anymore as I’d be tried for treason. It didn’t me bother though, as I knew that they watched the interview despite my being a ‘traitor’.' Don’t you feel you’re putting your life in danger? 'If they were to get to me, that wouldn’t be good for me. Let’s just say that I live under the illusion that they don’t know exactly where I live or where my studio is.' Scenes and memories Thomas Hand, father of Emily who was kidnapped to Gaza and returned, was also interviewed by Bouzo. 'It was hard. I wasn’t prepared to deal with the story of the little girl whose mother had died, who was kidnapped, and whose fate was unknown' she says. 'I had to be composed with him during the broadcast. It's not an Israeli audience that identifies with this terrible story. My job is to use the force of the story to convince my audience. They can hit me with thousands of horrific stories on the Palestinian side, but I know that my audience is also shocked by the stories. There are hundreds of TV channels in the Arab world, none of which present the Israeli side. There’s no mention of the hostages or their families.' Her list of Israeli interviewees is long, but 'I deliberately won’t mention their names to an Israeli newspaper, although I do remember every single one' she says. 'They’ve included Jewish mothers and Arab fathers whose children had been kidnapped. Making their voices heard in the Arab world seems like a very important task' What reactions did you get? Bouzo: 'Mainly insults, swearing and cursing. They don’t write me nice things. I understand, but it doesn’t bother me. People in the Arab world haven’t gotten used to looking at Israel objectively. You bring out the fear and very strong emotions, mainly envy.' She says that Michael Levy talked to her about his dream of bringing back his brother Or, father of three-year-old Almog whose mother Einav was murdered and who has been raised by his grandparents for the past year. 'It’s a very good thing that the world is rid of him. I’m sure the people of Lebanon are happy, although they obviously can’t demonstrate their joy over Nasrallah’s assassination.' 'I wake up every morning and think about what I have to do to bring back my brother' he told Bouzo. 'I talk, meet people, tell the kidnapping story to remind people, mainly overseas, that there are hostages and that they have families.' This conversation, too, was met with cursing and reminding her of the Gazans’ situation. Between interviewing hostages’ families, Bouzo also talks to fascinating figures, mainly in the Arab world 'to break down the Israeli wall' she explains. 'I interviewed a young woman who had fled Egypt, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the son of the Shah of Iran, Reza Pahlavi, following his highly publicized visit to Israel. This interview accrued so many views and garnered so much interest that I requested, and was granted, a second interview to talk about Iran today and Pahlavi’s special relationship with Israel.' 'The more I think about it,' says Bouzo, 'if I’d have stayed in Syria, I’d have been dead long ago. The Syrian regime has a lot of beef with me, ever since I wrote on Facebook what the regime was doing in the city of Daraa on the Jordanian border. It was a horrific massacre that started off with arresting children and carried on to chopping off hands and feet during interrogations. They did it in the most brutal manner, along with their partners from Hezbollah in Lebanon.' 'My family and I started getting death threats. My uncle heard from Mukhabarat (Syrian intelligence) people in Damascus that my name appeared on an arrest list and was taken aback as he knew that if I was arrested, my parents and sister weren’t safe either. 'We decided to leave quickly before they caught us. We flew to the UAE, and from there on to the United States. If I’d have missed the flight, I wouldn’t be alive today. After I left, I learned that the Syrian regime had executed journalists like me who had written about the regime’s crimes. I still have nightmares about what could have happened if I would have insisted on staying.' Bouzo visited Israel for the first time in December and says, 'I dream of coming again.' The Arab-Jewish organization, Sharaka brought her to Israel as a special guest and arranged a trip kicking off in Eilat, visiting Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and ending up on the Israeli-Syrian border, and included visiting a border-adjacent Israeli winery. What did you feel when you stood by the border and saw the Lebanese and Syrian sides? 'I cried shamelessly. The Israeli side was in full bloom, flourishing. I looked at the other side and knew nothing there was blossoming or there’s no kind of human thriving. All the houses beyond the border are being used as arsenals and covers for Hezbollah.' A sigh of relief One stop on Bouzo’s journey getting to know Israel, was at the Erez crossing on the Gaza border. 'I talked to Palestinian women at the crossing and asked them what they thought about peace with Israel' she says. 'Without exception, and I spoke to at least ten women at the crossing, they said that very much wanted there to be peace. I believe the initiative has to come from the Israeli side - talking about peace with the Palestinians and taking steps toward peace, because you’re the strong side.' You must be familiar with Netanyahu’s views on peace with the Palestinians 'I observe from the sidelines, and would rather not go into controversial matters in Israel that I don’t know about. I very much respect Netanyahu. He’s a smart and realistic leader. I know that not everyone in Israel likes him, but I stand by what I’m saying: Netanyahu is very suitable for Israel at this difficult time, and he'll also win the next election, because he’d got it.' Are you in touch with your family in Syria? 'I was last there in 2011, and I dare not go back as I know exactly what awaits me there. For their own safety, I also don’t initiate contact with my family. Every now and then, I get information about them, but I don’t initiate phone calls. 'I feel very sorry for them and for anyone in Syria against their will - and that’s most Syrians. I know I’ll never go back there. I’m married to an American. I have a son and daughter. My life is good and I’m not looking for trouble.' 'As long as Bashar el Assad is in government, under Iran’s thumb, there’s also no chance of changing things in Syria. He’s not a man of peace. He’s a weak leader who the Iranians and Russians are exploiting and doing whatever they want in Syria. That said, there are signs that Assad and the gang around him are totally fed up with the Iranians and are looking for ways of getting them out of influential positions without harming the president’s status.' Bouzo has been following the chain of assassinations in Lebanon with keen interest. That of Nasrallah fascinates her. 'Because of his special persona as a villain serving the Iranian regime through his organization, Hezbollah that lives off exporting drugs,' she explains. 'What can we say about such a ‘freedom fighter’? It’s a very good thing that the world is rid of him. I’m sure the people of Lebanon are happy, although they obviously can’t demonstrate their joy over Nasrallah’s assassination, or those of all the other wicked people.' Bouzo wishes to stress that she doesn’t regard the destruction of Hezbollah’s leadership as 'assassinations'. 'They have so much blood on their hands – the blood of citizens of my homeland in Syria, the blood of Lebanese who tried opposing Hezbollah and the blood of Israelis,' she says. 'I see these operations in Lebanon from the beepers injuring Hezbollah activists, then the walkie-talkies and through to making the Hezbollah leadership disappear, all the way up to Nasrallah – as a just war. I’m willing to say out loud to whoever will listen, that they deserved it, and that Israeli struck them in a very sophisticated way. I’m glad that you’re setting Lebanon ablaze to get rid of Hezbollah.' 'I want to tell you and all your readers in Israel how wonderful it was and how happy it made me to see a sigh of relief across Arabic social media. Countries in the Arab world haven’t yet plucked up the courage - as they’re subjects of dictatorships - but I’m sure we’ll soon here cheers of joys for the fate of Hezbollah leaders. We’ll hear them in Syria, Saudi Arabia and mainly in Lebanon.' 'A new process has started here. Mark my words. A new process that needs to be utilized wisely. You need to think together, at the most senior levels, how to redesign the Middle East. There’s much work to be done, and it won’t be easy, but it needs to be done for the people even for the sake of the wavering regimes, and I’m sure you know which regimes I mean.' Of Yahiya Sinwar’s assassination, she says, 'Assassinating a creature as evil as Sinwar is an important step toward freeing the world of the threat of terrorism. His bloody regime has caused the deaths of so many Israelis, and he’s also killed Palestinians - innocent people. ' His assassination conveys a message to anyone seeking to disseminate terror: The regime in Tehran is shaking in its boots and any terrorist organization is feeling the pressure right now. Sinwar’s assassination is a victory for justice and brings the world one step closer to a safer and freer world.' Is there anything you’d like to tell Israeli readers before wrapping up? 'I’ve started learning Hebrew. It’s really not hard. I already know words beyond ‘shalom’ (hello), ‘todah’ (thank you) and ‘lehitra’ot’ (goodbye). They say the word ‘savlanut’ (patience) is very important for you, but I understand you guys don’t have too much patience.'

Iran denies reports of Musk meeting with officials	Country's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi denies foreign report claiming it was 'fabricated' by US media due to ulterior and unclear motives Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi strongly denied a reported meeting between Tehran's United Nations envoy and U.S. billionaire Elon Musk, state TV reported on Saturday. 'This was a fabricated story by American media, and the motives behind this can also be speculated,' Araqchi said. Tehran's denial of the meeting comes following a New York Times report published on Thursday citing several Iranian officials who said Musk sojourned with Iranian UN ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani in New York on Monday. According to the report, the secret meeting, requested by Musk, lasted over an hour and was described as 'positive' and 'good news.' Musk did not respond to requests for comment from the Times. Trump’s communications director, Steven Cheung, declined to address the meeting, saying, 'We do not comment on reports of private meetings that did or did not occur.' According to the Times, the meeting allowed Iran to engage indirectly with the incoming administration, as Musk is expected to take a role in the Trump administration as co-director of a yet-to-be-estblished government efficiency agency. Iranian officials reportedly suggested Musk seek sanctions exemptions from the U.S. Treasury and explore bringing his businesses to Tehran.

Iran secretly elected its next leader, report says	Sources close to Tehran's regime claim Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei elected his second son for the role and may abdicate even before his death Tehran has secretly chosen Mojtaba Khamenei, the second son of Iran's Supreme leader Ali Khamenei, as the next head of the country, Iran International, a Persian-language international media outlet with ties to Iranian regime opponents reported on Saturday. According to the report, Mojtaba may assume the role even before the death of his 85-year-old father, who is reportedly suffering from a severe illness. The report claimed that 60 members of Iran's Assembly of Experts convened on September 26 in an exceptionally unusual meeting at the elder Khamenei's demand. They were instructed to decide on the succession immediately, without prior notice and under strict confidentiality. Despite initial opposition to both the decision and the process, the assembly ultimately reached a unanimous agreement to designate Mojtaba as the successor following the leader's and his representatives' insistence, which allegedly included direct threats. The assembly resolved to maintain maximum secrecy over the decision due to fears of widespread public protests. Members were warned to keep the meeting confidential, with threats of repercussions for any leaks. Indeed, the meeting's details were kept under wraps for five weeks. Concerns about protests stem from the undemocratic nature of the process, compounded by Khamenei's prior designation of his second son for the role. Over the past two years, Mojtaba has been groomed for leadership, taking on a more active and central role in decision-making related to the Iranian regime. His appointment has thus become a foregone conclusion despite his lack of experience and the absence of any formal positions in the government. Sources familiar with the meeting indicated that Iran's supreme leader might hand over the reins to his second son during his lifetime, taking steps to prepare for a smooth transition. They believe Khamenei hopes to secure Mojtaba's leadership and preempt the anticipated opposition that could arise after his passing.

Rocket hits Haifa synagogue after Hezbollah salvo	IDF says only some of the munitions were intercepted with at least 10 being launched; fall causes damages, injury as a result of running for shelter The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported on Saturday that Hezbollah fired at least 10 rockets toward Haifa with only some of them being intercepted by the Iron Dome. The hit damaged the local 'Avot U'Banim' synagogue in the city According to the Magen David Adom emergency service, one woman was injured while running for shelter before a rocket hit the Merkaz HaCarmel neighborhood in the city, where vehicles were set on fire as a result. Reports suggested another hit was seen in another part of the city, with no reports of injuries or damages. Israel's National Rescue and Fire Authority said a vehicle caught fire in one scene, causing damage to several buildings found nearby. 'At this time, there are no reports of trapped individuals or wounded, but firefighters on the scene alongside medical teams and the Israel Police continue searching in order to rule out victims,' the authority said in a statement. The barrage comes following an intense day of fighting against the Iran-backed terror group, with the IDF bombarding Hezbollah's stronghold in Lebanon's capital in eight strike waves throughout the day. Lebanese reports indicated that Israeli airstrikes have intensified in Dahieh, with multiple hits reported within minutes of each other. Local media has claimed that the scope of the destruction in the southern Beirut suburb is reminiscent of the 2006 Lebanon War.

IDF names fallen soldier killed in Lebanon battles	Sergeant Ori Nisanovich, 21, from Jerusalem, a soldier in the Golani Brigade's 13th Battalion killed in action fighting Hezbollah terrorists The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported on Saturday that Sergeant Ori Nisanovich, 21, from Jerusalem, a soldier in the Golani Brigade's 13th Battalion fell during combat in southern Lebanon. Some 795 soldiers have fallen since the start of the war in Gaza. The IDF has intensified its strikes in Lebanon in recent days. Over the weekend, the Israeli Air Force targeted over 20 sites in Beirut's Dahieh district across eight strike waves. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi addressed the fighting against Hezbollah during a visit to southern Lebanon on Saturday, saying, 'Hezbollah has paid a big price, its chain of command has collapsed, many of its operatives have been killed, and extensive infrastructure dismantled. This organization will continue to fire, and we will continue to fight, to implement plans, to go further, conduct deep strikes, and hit Hezbollah very hard.' Meanwhile, Israel is waiting for Lebanon's response to a draft agreement delivered by the U.S. on Friday. Security officials estimate Hezbollah and the Lebanese government won't agree to give Israel freedom of action in cases of violations, foreseeing several more days of disputes and negotiations before the Lebanese consent. Israel has agreed that the Lebanese army will be equipped by three entities — the U.S., France and the UK— which will also serve as guarantors and participate in the agreement's enforcement. Despite this, skepticism remains in Israel regarding the Lebanese army's ability to act against Hezbollah.

Trump's pro-Israel cabinet picks upset Muslims who voted for him	Muslim leaders protest the president-elect's nominations following his election victory, accusing him of placing Israel above his local voter base U.S. Muslim leaders who supported Republican Donald Trump to protest against the Biden administration's support for Israel's war in Gaza and attacks on Lebanon have been deeply disappointed by his cabinet picks, they said. 'Trump won because of us and we're not happy with his secretary of state pick and others,' said Rabiul Chowdhury, a Philadelphia investor who chaired the Abandon Harris campaign in Pennsylvania and co-founded Muslims for Trump. Muslim support for Trump helped him win Michigan and may have factored into other swing state wins, strategists believe. Trump picked Republican senator Marco Rubio, a staunch supporter of Israel for Secretary of State. Earlier this year, Rubio said he would not call, opens new tab for a ceasefire in Gaza, and that he believed Israel should destroy 'every element' of Hamas. 'These people are vicious animals,' he added. Trump also nominated Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor and staunch pro-Israel conservative who backs Israeli control of the West Bank and has called a two-state solution in Palestine 'unworkable', as the next ambassador to Israel. He has picked Republican Representative Elise Stefanik, who called the UN a 'cesspool of antisemitism', opens new tab for its condemnation of deaths in Gaza, to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Rexhinaldo Nazarko, executive director of the American Muslim Engagement and Empowerment Network (AMEEN), said Muslim voters had hoped Trump would choose cabinet officials who work toward peace, and there was no sign of that. 'We are very disappointed,' he said. 'It seems like this administration has been packed entirely with neoconservatives and extremely pro-Israel, pro-war people, which is a failure on the on the side of President Trump, to the pro-peace and anti-war movement.' Nazarko said the community would continue pressing to make its voices heard about ending the war in Gaza. 'At least we're on the map.' Hassan Abdel Salam, a former professor at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities and co-founder of the Abandon Harris campaign, which endorsed Green Party candidate Jill Stein, said Trump's staffing plans were not surprising, but had proven even more extreme that he had feared. 'It's like he's going on Zionist overdrive,' he said. 'We were always extremely skeptical ... Obviously we're still waiting to see where the administration will go, but it does look like our community has been played.' The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Several Muslim and Arab supporters of Trump said they hoped Richard Grenell, Trump's former acting director of national intelligence, would play a key role after he led months of outreach to Muslim and Arab American communities, and was even introduced as a potential next secretary of state at events. Another key Trump ally, Massad Boulos, the Lebanese father-in-law of Trump's daughter Tiffany, met repeatedly with Arab American and Muslim leaders. Both promised Arab American and Muslim voters that Trump was a candidate for peace who would act swiftly to end the wars in the Middle East and beyond. Neither was immediately reachable. Trump made several visits to cities with large Arab American and Muslim populations, include a stop in Dearborn, a majority Arab city, where he said he loved Muslims, and Pittsburgh, where he called Muslims for Trump 'a beautiful movement. They want peace. They want stability.' Bill Bazzi, mayor of neighboring Dearborn Heights, who endorsed Trump, said he met the president-elect three times and still believed he would work to end the war, despite the cabinet appointments. Rola Makki, the Lebanese American, Muslim vice chair for outreach of the Michigan Republican Party, agreed. 'I don't think everyone's going to be happy with every appointment Trump makes, but the outcome is what matters,' she said. 'I do know that Trump wants peace, and what people need to realize is that there's 50,000 dead Palestinians and 3,000 dead Lebanese, and that's happened during the current administration.'

Israel pounds Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut with relentless bomb...	Lebanese media reports eight waves of attack on Dahieh district, with multiple hits reported within minutes of each other; further strikes reported in southern Lebanon as IDF advances deeper into Lebanese territory; Islamic Jihad confirms commanders killed in Syria strikes The IDF has carried out eight waves of airstrikes in Beirut's Dahieh district throughout Saturday, according to Hezbollah-affiliated media, as Israel ramps up its attacks on the Hezbollah stronghold. This comes in the backdrop of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group confirming two of their commanders were eliminated in a strike near Damascus that took place on Thursday. Lebanese reports indicated that Israeli airstrikes have intensified in Dahieh, with multiple hits reported within minutes of each other. Local media has claimed that the scope of the destruction in the southern Beirut suburb is reminiscent of the 2006 Lebanon War. One strike reportedly targeted the headquarters of the Supreme Islamic Shiite Council in the Harat Hreik neighborhood. Meanwhile, Lebanese media reported civilian casualties from strikes in various locations. Seven people, including five children, were reportedly killed in an attack on the village of Al-Kharbatha in the Bekaa Valley. In Nabatieh, the death toll from a separate strike rose to five. In Tyre, an airstrike targeting a motorcyclist killed one person and injured another. In a statement, IDF Arabic-language spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee urged residents of 15 villages in southern Lebanon, many of whom have already fled, to evacuate immediately. Adraee warned that the IDF would target areas used by Hezbollah for military operations. At noon, the IDF confirmed additional strikes on southern Lebanon, including rocket launch sites used for attacks on Israel. Over the past day, Israel has attacked more than 160 targets in Lebanon and Gaza, including weapons depots, command centers and launchers, the military said. The Lebanese National News Agency claimed that Israeli forces seized a strategic hill in the village of Shaam, five kilometers from the border, before allegedly destroying a shrine and several homes and later withdrawing. The IDF did not confirm the report. These developments come as Israel pushes deeper into southern Lebanon, with ground forces reportedly advancing to the second line of villages along the border. According to Lebanese media, a firefight occurred at the farthest point reached by Israeli troops in six weeks of ground operations. Meanwhile, rocket fire from Lebanon continued, with the IDF reporting over 35 launches toward northern Israel, including Safed and the Haifa Bay area. Most rockets fell in unpopulated areas or were intercepted. Damage was reported to agricultural structures near Tamra, where livestock were killed and vehicles damaged. Following the intense fighting in Lebanon, two senior Islamic Jihad figures were killed in an Israeli strike on Syria on Thursday, a source from the Palestinian terror group which has fought against Israel in Gaza alongside Hamas told AFP on Saturday. The source said that Abdel Aziz Minawi, a member of Islamic Jihad's political bureau, and the group's foreign relations chief Rasmi Abu Issa were killed in the strike on Qudsaya, in the Damascus area. The strike that took place on Thursday targeted military complexes and Islamic Jihad headquarters at several locations in Damascus and the surrounding countryside. Official Syrian news agency SANA reported of a strike in the Mazzeh neighborhood and later in Qudsaya. The Syrian Defense Ministry reported 15 fatalities and 16 injuries following the strikes. 'Air Force fighter jets, under the direction of IDF Northern Command, struck multiple military structures and Islamic Jihad headquarters in Syria,' The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported shortly after the strike. 'The strike dealt a significant blow to the organization’s headquarters and its operatives. The Islamic Jihad, led by its heads outside the Gaza Strip, carried out the deadly October 7 attack alongside Hamas and has been orchestrating terror activities against the State of Israel since,' it added. According to the Syrian Defense Ministry's official statement released on Thursday, 'At around 3:20 p.m., Israel targeted residential buildings in the Mazzeh neighborhood and the Qudsaya area in rural Damascus. Fifteen were killed and 16 were injured According to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor, the strikes on Thursday in and around Damascus killed 23 people. SANA noted that the strike targeted two residential buildings, while the opposition-affiliated Syrian news site Voice of the Capital reported an apartment was hit in the area. According to reports, the attack took place while Ali Larijani, an advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, was visiting Damascus on a 'special political mission,' as reported by the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen outlet.

Stolen Magen David Adom ambulance prompts police chase in capital, ending with arrest of suspect in his 20s after ramming police car and fleeing on foot A Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance was stolen Saturday morning from Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, prompting a police chase that ended with the arrest of a suspect in his 20s from a village near the city. No injuries were reported in the incident. According to police, the ambulance was spotted driving erratically in a nearby village following a report to the emergency hotline. Officers set up a roadblock and signaled the driver to stop, but the suspect continued onto Highway 1, ramming a police vehicle and causing minor damage. The chase escalated until the suspect abandoned the ambulance and fled on foot. Police apprehended him after a brief pursuit and transferred him to the Moriah station for questioning. Magen David Adom said the incident began when the suspect approached paramedics stationed near the emergency room and suddenly sped off in the ambulance. 'We view any attack on MDA medical teams and ambulances intended for saving lives with the utmost severity,' said MDA Director-General Eli Bin. 'We thank the Israeli police for their swift and determined response, which ensured the ambulance was quickly recovered and public safety maintained. We trust authorities to take all necessary legal action against the suspect.'

Lebanese media mirrors Hezbollah's reluctance to accept cease-fir...	Hezbollah mouthpiece Al-Akhbar squarely rejects Israeli terms, rejecting proposals to involve Lebanese Army in disarming Hezbollah or allow Israel 'operational freedom' under self-defense clause, calling it cover for further aggression Lebanese media aligned with Hezbollah voiced skepticism Saturday over the prospects of a cease-fire agreement with Israel, reflecting the terrorist group's reluctance to accept the terms under discussion. The Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar, known for its ties to Hezbollah, published multiple articles suggesting pessimism over the likelihood of a deal. Sources told the paper that despite ongoing talks, there is little optimism in Lebanon about reaching an agreement. One article by editor Ibrahim al-Amine dismissed Israel's conditions for a cease-fire, accusing it of seeking to dictate terms to Lebanon. 'Israel wants the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL to achieve what it failed to accomplish militarily—disarming Hezbollah operatives south of the Litani River,' he wrote, adding, 'Surrendering to the enemy's demands, directly or indirectly, is not an option that aligns with the sacrifices made.' Another article by Al-Akhbar columnist Yehia Dbouk alleged that Israel seeks a formal agreement to legitimize further strikes. 'There will be no cease-fire dictated by Israel, which is in no position to impose terms,' the article read, criticizing key elements of the cease-fire proposal and suggesting that assigning the Lebanese Army the task of dismantling Hezbollah’s infrastructure south of the Litani River would effectively turn it into an 'Israeli proxy.' Concerns were also raised over provisions allowing Israel to act in 'self-defense,' which the writer argues would legitimize Israeli cross-border operations, including assassinations, abductions and attacks under the guise of security needs. The London-based Asharq Al-Awsat highlighted fears in Lebanon that this clause might grant Israel the 'operational freedom' it has sought, a point that has already faced opposition in Beirut. The Lebanese daily Al-Joumhouria reported that while Hezbollah has refrained from public statements, its priority remains halting Israeli strikes. 'Hezbollah’s stance is that Israel should not gain politically what it failed to achieve militarily,' the paper said. It added that Hezbollah lacks trust in the United States, which it views as a partner in Israeli attacks, and opposes rushing into cease-fire agreements that could lead to further Israeli demands. In contrast, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who negotiates on Hezbollah’s behalf, struck a more optimistic tone. 'The atmosphere is positive, and the work is progressing well,' Berri told Al-Joumhouria. According to the Wall Street Journal, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has approved a cease-fire framework aimed at ending the northern conflict. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer reportedly presented the proposal to Trump during a meeting this week, with Trump expressing hope that the plan could be implemented before his inauguration on January 20. On Thursday, the U.S. presented Lebanon with the draft cease-fire agreement developed in coordination with Israel. President Joe Biden’s special envoy to the region Amos Hochstein reportedly warned Lebanese leaders that he would not return to Beirut unless they demonstrated readiness to finalize the agreement. Hochstein delivered the draft to Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Speaker Berri.

Parodying hostages and hailing Hamas: What’s happening on US camp...	UPenn suspends students for parodying hostage posters with flyers reading 'Missing Cow' and offering 'chalk and beer' as reward; Harvard suspends students for protesting 'Palestinian genocide'; UC Berkeley course lauding Hamas ignites fresh controversy The University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) has suspended the Delta Sigma Phi fraternity for 18 months after its members were found to have posted hundreds of flyers parodying posters of Israeli hostages abducted by Hamas. The flyers, which appeared across campus starting in November 2023, featured designs resembling hostage posters but contained messages like 'Missing Cow' and offered a reward of 'a box of chalk and a can of beer.' A university spokesperson condemned the act as 'crude' and 'deplorable.' While fraternity members claimed the stunt was not antisemitic but rather a 'joke to promote veganism,' UPenn’s administration demanded the group undergo a 'cultural change' as a condition for resuming activities. Meanwhile, Harvard University’s Divinity School suspended several students for two weeks for participating in a library protest last week, framed as a 'pray-in.' Protesters recited texts from the Quran, Torah and New Testament while criticizing what they termed 'Palestinian genocide.' The event also involved distributing posters condemning the university, Chabad and the Hillel Jewish student organization, accusing them of supporting Israel’s war in Gaza. Dean Marla Frederick addressed the suspension in a letter to the university community, writing, 'we honor the importance of prayer and what it represents for so many. And, as one colleague reminded us recently, ‘prayer is protest,’' Frederick wrote. 'In and of itself, advocacy for the cause of people under duress — whether in Israel, Gaza, or other parts of the world — is noble.' However, she clarified that the prayer protest violated university policies prohibiting demonstrations in libraries. 'While some may agree or disagree on the University’s guidelines regarding protest found in the University-Wide Statement on Rights and Responsibilities and their interpretation, they are the rules we currently have and as such we must uphold them,' Frederick wrote. Course promotes pro-Hamas ideology The University of California, Berkeley, is embroiled in controversy surrounding a course accused of promoting pro-Hamas views under the guise of academic study. The class, titled 'Leninism and Anarchism: A Theoretical Approach to Literature and Film,' is part of the Comparative Literature department’s core curriculum. It includes references to Hamas as 'revolutionary resistance forces combating settler-colonialism' and criticizes the 'genocide' of Palestinians by Israel with U.S. backing. The course description originally opened with, 'With the US-backed and -funded genocide being carried out against Indigenous Palestinians by the Israeli Occupying Force, many have found it difficult to envision a reality beyond the one we are living in today.' It praised Hamas’s fight against settler colonialism and posed questions about whether Marxism-Leninism and anarchism could offer a vision for a better future. The syllabus included readings from figures such as Stalin, Lenin and Mao Zedong and promised students an opportunity to 'piece together an archive of Anarchist and Leninist theory.' An Israeli professor at Berkeley criticized the course, calling it 'a seemingly literary course that, in practice, celebrates Hamas under the cover of academia.' He added, 'This is overt political propaganda glorifying violence, in violation of university policies prohibiting the use of classrooms to advance political agendas.' In response to a query from Ynet, Berkeley said, 'The matter is being addressed. The original course description was changed.' A university official added, ' While we can’t, as a matter of law comment on personnel issues, generally speaking we take our policies that prohibit using the classroom for political advocacy very seriously. If/when there is reason to suspect those policies are being violated we respond quickly.' When pressed on specific actions taken, the university cited privacy laws as a reason for withholding further details. This incident follows previous controversies at Berkeley, including a course titled 'Palestine: A Settler-Colonial Analysis,' which faced protests from Jewish organizations for allegedly promoting anti-Israel and antisemitic narratives. That course, previously an elective, was briefly suspended in 2016 before being reinstated with revisions.

Iran and Qatar behind South Africa’s World Court case against Isr...	Report alleges foreign financial and political support in 'genocide' case against Israel; ruling ANC, near bankruptcy, reportedly received major donation from foreign states after filing claim in December A new report by the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy (ISGAP) alleges financial and political involvement by Iran and Qatar in South Africa’s December 2023 case at the International Criminal Court (ICC) accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. According to the New York-based ISGAP, South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC), which was nearing bankruptcy, received substantial donations from the two nations just days after filing the ICC claim. South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola attended the swearing-in of Iranian President Masoud Pezhkian in Tehran last July, the report states. During the visit, Lamola met with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri, who praised him for advancing the ICC case. Bagheri called Lamola 'an innovative diplomat' and reiterated Iran’s full support for South Africa’s role in the legal effort. The report estimates that initiating an ICC case requires approximately $10.5 million, with total legal costs reaching $79 million, necessitating a complex network of international legal experts. ISGAP concludes that such costs suggest significant external funding. Rumors of Iranian involvement have circulated in South Africa, particularly among opposition leaders. However, ANC officials, including President Cyril Ramaphosa, have refused to disclose the origins of a mysterious donation that helped the party recover from nearly $30 million in debt just before filing the case. ISGAP also highlighted a surge in trade between South Africa and Qatar, which grew from $307 million to nearly $1 billion over the past decade, indicating strengthened economic ties. The report suggests Iran views South Africa as a strategic hub to bypass Western sanctions and leverage access to sensitive technologies like satellite interception, hacking and missile guidance. In exchange, South Africa has supported Iran’s inclusion in the BRICS economic bloc, granting Tehran access to international funding despite U.S. sanctions. The report further notes that 45 of the 574 citations in South Africa’s ICC filing came from organizations openly critical of Israel. This raises questions about the case's credibility, ISGAP argues. Among the cited sources is Al-Haq, an NGO designated as a terror organization by Israel, though this classification has been rejected by the U.S. and Europe. Another is the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, led by Raji Sourani, who previously served prison time in Israel for membership in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which is designated as a terror organization by Israel, the U.S., the UK, the EU, Canada, Australia and Japan The ANC and its allies have not commented on the allegations.

Gaza explosions rattle central Israel; scientist explains why	Locals reported hearing loud blasts Friday night, likely stemming from IDF strikes in Gaza, over 40 miles away; why do sounds of blasts from Gaza reach central Israel, how does weather play a role and why are they louder at night? Here’s the explanation Residents of central Israel, including the Gush Dan and Shephelah regions, reported hearing loud explosions Friday night and early Saturday. The IDF confirmed no rocket impacts in the area while police attributed the sounds to explosions originating in Gaza, more than 40 miles away. Dr. Yuval Rosenberg, a physicist at the Davidson Institute of Science Education, explained to Ynet that atmospheric conditions can affect how sound travels, amplifying or diminishing its intensity. 'When the air near the ground is warmer due to the sun heating the surface, sound waves are refracted upward into the sky. This can reduce the noise we hear,' he explained. However, during nighttime, when the ground cools faster than the air above it, sound waves bend back toward the ground. 'This phenomenon is why explosions from Gaza often sound louder in central Israel at night than during the day,' Dr. Rosenberg added. The unique interaction of weather and sound physics highlights why certain noises travel farther or seem more pronounced depending on the time of day and environmental conditions. In addition to explosions heard from Gaza, powerful booms have echoed through the Gush Dan region during the war, caused by rockets detonating over the sea. These loud blasts have sparked anxiety among residents due to their intensity. 'There are many factors that can influence the volume of an explosion we hear, meaning identical rockets detonating can sound vastly different,' explained Dr. Yuval Rosenberg. 'The sound waves we perceive are essentially small disturbances in air pressure, which our brain interprets as sound after they reach our ears and vibrate the eardrum and the rest of our auditory system.' 'When a rocket explodes, it creates a shockwave characterized by a sudden and significant change in air pressure,' explained Dr. Rosenberg. 'At close range, this shockwave can be extremely dangerous, capable of destroying buildings or killing marine life if the detonation occurs at sea. 'As it travels, the shockwave loses energy as it interacts with and is absorbed by objects, creating destruction but also heating the air. Eventually, as it continues over long distances, the shockwave dissipates and transforms into the sound waves we hear. Simply put, a shockwave is like a massive ocean swell that breaks into smaller waves.' Dr. Rosenberg highlighted the difference in how explosion sounds carry over land versus sea. 'For us to clearly hear the explosion, a significant amount of sound waves must reach our ears, or more precisely, the sound wave intensity must remain strong. However, various factors can block sound waves from reaching us. For instance, shockwaves and sound waves can be absorbed by the ground, trees and buildings. Hard surfaces like hills or building walls can also reflect sound waves, preventing them from reaching us,' he said. 'This is why when a rocket explodes on land, there are many obstacles that diminish the volume of the noise we hear. In contrast, over the sea, there are few such barriers, allowing sound waves to travel more freely and reach us more effectively,' he added.

US pilots receive Silver Stars for heroic drone interceptions dur...	Capt. Lacie 'Sonic' Hester, first woman to receive honor, landed under fire with 'hung missile' on her F-15, not knowing if it was 'going to explode on our wing'; her team intercepted over 70 Iranian drones, showing immense composure after exhausting ammunition The U.S. Air Force on Friday awarded Capt. Lacie 'Sonic' Hester and Maj. Benjamin 'Irish' Coffey the Silver Star, America’s third-highest combat honor, for their heroism in intercepting over 70 Iranian drones threatening Israel during Tehran’s assault in April. The operation, conducted by U.S. air and naval forces, unfolded in complete darkness. 'When we were getting our brief to go fly that night, we still had no idea,' Hester told CNN, describing the perilous maneuvers and courage required to counter the drone swarm. 'It could have just been a bust — just another sortie of flying in a circle, waiting for it to happen.' Hester became the first woman in U.S. history to receive the honor—America’s third-highest military decoration for valor in combat. Her mission partner Coffey was also recognized with the same award. Hester’s recognition reignited debate in the United States about women’s roles in combat units. FOX News Pete Hegseth, set to become secretary of defense under President-elect Donald Trump, has criticized women serving in ground combat roles but stated he has 'no issue' with women in aviation roles. Hester and Coffee told CNN they had to improvise during the overnight attack as they attempted to intercept Iranian drones in complete darkness. At one point, Coffey descended his aircraft dangerously low to approach a drone he was tasked with downing. 'You feel the terrain rush, you feel yourself getting closer and closer to the ground. The risk was just too high to try again,' Coffey recounted, admitting the maneuver was unsuccessful. F-15 pilot Lt. Col. Timothy 'Diesel' Causey said that the fighter pilots had not had much time before then to practice. Attack drones 'are a low cost, low risk for the enemy to employ. They can send out massive amounts of them and we have to engage them to protect civilians and to protect our allies,' Causey told CNN. 'We hadn’t started practicing on a large scale yet.' 'You’re talking about something that is on the very edge of a fighter aircraft’s ability to detect — what we call ‘find, fix, track, target and engage,’' Coffey said. 'The best radar in the inventory is in this airplane behind us, and no one really knew whether or not its capability to find these [drones] even existed.' The pilots described another significant challenge: each aircraft could carry only eight air-to-air missiles per sortie, and ammunition was quickly depleted despite spending hours in the air. Lt. Col. Curtis 'Voodoo' Culver, who participated in the interception efforts, said, 'That night, the mission was to shoot down drones with whatever weapons we had available to protect our ally. We ran out of missiles pretty quickly… 20 minutes maybe.' A subsequent critical task was landing back at base for rearming, often under fire or amid falling debris from interceptions. Occasionally, some of the fighter jets, including Coffey and Hester’s, had to land with a 'hung missile' — an emergency situation in which a missile is fired, but malfunctions and doesn’t actually launch. 'This missile — we don’t know if it’s armed, and we don’t know if it’s going to explode on our wing,' Coffey said. 'We don’t know if it’s going to explode while maintenance is safing the aircraft. It’s a big deal. And now, as we start into the landing process, we enter alarm red.' The base had essentially entered a lockdown, signaling an imminent attack, as alarms blared even on the runways 'Missiles and drones are flying over base, and they’re being intercepted over base, so the alarm red goes off,' Causey said. 'Then at that point is really when you see a lot of military discipline and a lot of bravery under fire.' Maj. Clayton 'Rifle' Wicks, who oversaw ground operations for the aircraft during the attack, described the challenges posed by falling debris from intercepts littering the runways. 'Really all we could tell them was stay airborne as long as you can, with the gas that you have. Don’t divert, because even our divert airfields – we don’t know what’s going on there either, so if stuff is blowing up over our heads, very likely stuff is blowing up there too.' While all participating pilots received commendations, only Hester and Coffey were awarded the Silver Star. The pilots emphasized the bravery of ground crews, with Culver recalling a soldier who refueled planes near a truck loaded with fuel and gas while explosions rocked the base. '[T]he courage of that airman, that American, to stand up and do that for an ally, is incredible.' Immediately after the mission, President Joe Biden called to personally commend the pilots. 'Hey, you guys are the best in the whole damn world. That’s not hyperbole. Both these squadrons, you’re incredible,' Biden said, later apologizing for his enthusiasm and joking, 'I’m supposed to be much more reserved.'

Jared Kushner poised to steer Trump’s Middle East agenda behind t...	Trump’s son-in-law will act as a key advisor on Middle East policy despite holding no official role; known for close ties with leaders like Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Kushner’s influence sparks both praise and criticism Jared Kushner, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s son-in-law, is expected to play a key advisory role in shaping the administration’s Middle East strategy, despite not holding an official position, CNN reported on Friday, citing regional diplomats and Trump allies. Trump recently unveiled his Middle East team, naming former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee as the U.S. ambassador to Israel and real estate mogul Steven Witkoff as a special envoy to the region. Still, Kushner’s trusted relationships with Middle Eastern leaders make him a pivotal behind-the-scenes figure, sources said. 'No one on the incoming team has what Jared has, and that is trust,' a diplomat said. His influence, they added, stems from personal connections and trust earned over time, a quality not yet established by other incoming advisors. However, Kushner’s business ties in the region, particularly his close relationship with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, are expected to reignite criticism. During Trump’s first term, Kushner’s investment firm received $2 billion from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. Diplomats have expressed fears that Trump’s administration may prioritize family financial interests over national objectives. A U.S. official described Kushner’s direct ties with Saudi Arabia as troubling, citing private meetings with bin Salman that extended into the night. Kushner’s role is expected to focus on expanding the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab states. Trump and Kushner aim to secure further agreements with additional nations, sources said. In September, Kushner praised the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, calling it the 'most significant event in the Middle East since the Abraham Accords.' He argued that Nasrallah’s death left Iran vulnerable, saying, 'Hezbollah was Iran’s deterrent weapon for 40 years, aimed at Israel. Now, that deterrent is gone.' On Gaza, Kushner has advocated for drastic measures, including relocating Gaza residents to Israel’s Negev Desert during a Harvard panel in March. 'Gaza doesn’t really exist anymore; not much of it is left,' he said, suggesting Israel should use the opportunity to reshape the region. Critics point to Kushner’s controversial past role in drafting Trump’s so-called 'Deal of the Century' peace plan, which proposed land swaps in southern Israel—a move that sparked backlash from Israeli residents. Despite the controversies, Kushner remains a central figure in Trump’s vision for the Middle East, with a unique combination of trust and influence, sources said.

Hezbollah accuses Israel of striking children's TV channel in Leb...	Terror group says Israel struck Taha Kids TV, a children’s channel promoting incitement under innocent-seeming content; group vows strike wouldn’t halt its 'educational mission'; channel previously aired Star of David disappearing under plants Hezbollah issued a rare condemnation on Thursday, accusing the Israeli military of targeting the headquarters of Taha Kids TV, a Lebanese children’s television channel associated with the terrorist group. In a statement, Mohammad Afif, Hezbollah's media relations official, claimed the strike aimed to 'silence a voice that brings joy to innocent children, following attacks on children, schools and nurseries.' The statement also described the alleged attack as a 'violation of international conventions ensuring children’s rights to life, education and security,' adding that it would not deter the channel from its 'educational and humanitarian mission.' Hezbollah called on media outlets and international organizations to denounce the incident. Israel has not commented on the accusations, which remain unverified and based solely on Hezbollah’s claims. Taha Kids TV, a Hezbollah-affiliated channel, broadcasts content designed to promote the group’s ideology under the guise of children’s programming. Widely popular across the Arab world, the channel frequently features themes tied to the Palestinian cause, portraying Israeli actions as 'Zionist crimes' while incorporating content aligned with Iranian-backed narratives. The channel’s material includes songs about Jerusalem, jihad and Palestinian resistance, alongside Shiite religious ceremonies and rituals. One notable video, circulated on Iran’s Quds Day, shows a Star of David being covered by soil and plants until it disappears entirely, accompanied by the caption: 'They see it as far away; we see it as near.' While the channel promotes itself as 'educational and artistic,' with a focus on Islamic and cultural themes, critics argue it is a propaganda tool aimed at indoctrinating children into Hezbollah’s ideology. Taha Kids TV maintains a significant online presence, with over 1.6 million subscribers on YouTube and active accounts across social media platforms. Observers note that the channel’s content blends seemingly innocent entertainment with controversial messaging, further fueling debates over its role in shaping the views of its young audience.

FBI arrests Houston man accused of plotting ISIS-inspired attacks...	Anas Said, 28, allegedly plotted '9/11-style' attack on Jewish and Israeli sites, including synagogues and Israeli consulate; suspect 'openly acknowledged he wants to fight against and kill proponents of Israel' The FBI announced the arrest of Anas Said, 28, of Houston, on charges of distributing ISIS propaganda and planning a terrorist attack on sites linked to Jewish and Israeli communities. Federal prosecutors allege Said 'openly acknowledged that he wants to fight against and kill proponents of Israel.' Said, who was arrested at his Houston apartment last week, faces federal charges of attempting to provide material support to ISIS. According to prosecutors, he admitted to federal agents that he had repeatedly tried to join ISIS abroad, saying he would be willing to travel to Lebanon if released. The U.S. Department of Justice reported that Said offered his home as a 'safe haven' for ISIS operatives. Said’s plans reportedly included violent acts within the U.S., specifically targeting Israeli-affiliated sites and Jewish organizations. Authorities allege he surveilled the security measures and locations of synagogues and the Israeli consulate in Houston. Prosecutors claim Said intended to contact the head of a local Jewish organization to demand an end to support for Israel, with 'violent plans' if the individual refused. During questioning, Said allegedly expressed aspirations for a large-scale attack reminiscent of 9/11. Born in the U.S., Said reportedly moved to Lebanon as a child before returning to the U.S. His mother dismissed the allegations as 'fake news.' Authorities said that Said used social media accounts over the past two years to promote Islamic State content and incite violence. If convicted, Said faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Said’s brother told the FBI that he had openly expressed support for IS and its violent actions for years. 'He didn’t hide his intention to fight against Israel and its supporters,' the brother said.

A new report by the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy (ISGAP) alleges financial and political involvement by Iran and Qatar in South Africa’s December 2023 case at the International Criminal Court (ICC) accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. According to ISGAP, South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC), which was nearing bankruptcy, received a significant donation from the two nations just days after filing the ICC claim. South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola also attended an inauguration ceremony in Iran, where his Iranian counterpart publicly thanked him for supporting the legal case against Israel.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1ffkqhf1e	2024-11-15T10:21:49-08:00	
Israeli Air Force conducts third wave of strikes in Beirut’s Dahi...	Israeli fighter jets carried out a third wave of strikes on Beirut’s Dahieh district on Friday, targeting Hezbollah terror headquarters, the IDF said. The military emphasized efforts to minimize civilian harm, citing pre-attack intelligence gathering, precise targeting and advance evacuation warnings. The airstrikes also hit rocket stockpiles and 15 launchers in southern Lebanon, including systems poised to fire on Israel. Among the targets destroyed was the launcher used in Wednesday's rocket attack on central Israel, the military added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bku0rmsz1l	2024-11-15T10:20:44-08:00	
Missiles, intelligence and nukes: Iran’s arms race reaches space	Years after its first satellite launch, Iran runs dual space programs; while promoting civilian goals, the Revolutionary Guard develops spy satellites with Russian support; Western officials warn satellite launch tech mirrors that used for ballistic missiles Iran’s military ambitions are no secret, and its space program reflects its growing capabilities. Over the past two decades, Iran has developed and refined its space technology through two key channels: the Iranian Space Agency and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). While the space agency focuses on civilian projects, the IRGC runs a separate, state-directed program that includes the development of advanced spy satellites and launch vehicles. In recent years, Iran has launched more than 15 satellites, some in collaboration with Russia. Officially, the country claims these launches serve civilian purposes, such as agriculture and research. However, experts warn of a systematic military effort concealed behind this civilian front. The West is particularly alarmed by Iran’s integration of satellite imaging capabilities, missile development and strengthened ties with Russia. These advancements not only enhance Iran’s surveillance and intelligence-gathering abilities but also support its long-range ballistic missile program, raising significant security concerns. Tal Inbar, a missile and space expert, explains Iran’s dual-track approach: 'Iran has a space agency conducting intensified civilian and scientific activities, including developing various satellite launchers and satellites. Most Iranian satellite launchers are based on ballistic missile technology. The program began in the mid-1990s, with the first successful space launch in 2009.' The IRGC, Inbar notes, operates its own separate space initiative: 'The Revolutionary Guard is responsible for designing and launching both satellites and the missiles that carry them. They have conducted several successful launches and also procure surveillance satellites from Russia, with Russian assistance in launching them. At least one is operational, and more launches are planned for the future.' Two militaries, one goal Iran operates two distinct military entities: the Iranian army and the IRGC, each with separate missions. The regular army focuses on defending Iran’s borders from external threats, while the IRGC is tasked with safeguarding the Islamic Revolution and spreading it beyond Iran’s borders. Despite their differing goals, the two forces often collaborate. Over the years, the Iranian army has undergone significant changes, with its leadership aligning closely with the IRGC. Recent Iranian attacks on Israel were carried out by the IRGC, but reports from The Wall Street Journal and Qatar’s The New Arab suggest that the upcoming operation, already dubbed 'True Promise 3' in Iran, could involve the regular army as well, particularly in response to the death of four Iranian soldiers in Israel's strike last October. Breakthrough in Iran’s private space sector Meanwhile, Iran’s space program has seen a new milestone with the emergence of a private sector initiative. Last week at 2:48 a.m. Tehran time, the Iranian private company Space Omid successfully launched its first two satellites into orbit using a Russian-made launcher. The satellites, named Hodhod and Kawthar, were reportedly designed by young Iranian scientists. Kawthar, an observation satellite weighing 30 kilograms, was developed in 2019 and has a lifespan of over three years. It is intended for applications such as agriculture and land surveying. Hodhod, a compact 4-kilogram communication satellite, has a four-year lifespan and supports multiple uses, including agriculture, environmental monitoring, transportation and land surveys. The launch marks a significant step in diversifying Iran’s space program, which has traditionally been dominated by government efforts through the IRGC and other state entities. Academia joins Iran’s space ambitions Iran’s technological universities play a significant role in the country’s space research and development infrastructure, according to Inbar. 'Many satellites have been built at these institutions, ostensibly for civilian purposes,' he said. Experimental space launches involving short-duration flights are also conducted as part of these academic efforts, alongside the development of a suborbital manned spacecraft. Inbar explained that this type of craft reaches space without entering Earth’s orbit. 'All of this is considered part of the civilian activities of the Iranian Space Agency,' he added. Inbar emphasized that Iran’s space programs have not accelerated due to the region’s current tensions but have progressed steadily over years of planning. 'Space programs are not adjusted on short timelines because of a conflict or war,' he said. 'The recent launches are not tied to current tensions—they operate independently of regional circumstances.' Iran became the 43rd country to achieve a presence in space in 2005 with the launch of its first satellite, Sina-1, from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Russia. Since then, the nation has made advancements in satellite technology, providing services such as communication, navigation, scientific research and weather forecasting. After developing key infrastructure and satellite designs, Iran began launching satellites independently, made possible by constructing domestic launch facilities. Among the most notable are the Khomeini Space Center in Semnan, the Qom Space Station, the Alborz Space Center and a new launch site under construction in Chabahar. Iran’s early satellite launches had mixed success. Sina-1, built in Russia at Iran’s request, was successfully launched in 2005 but later veered off course due to technical issues, losing communication with Earth. In 2009, Iran launched Omid ('Hope' in Persian), the first satellite designed and built entirely domestically. The launch, conducted from Semnan, made Iran the ninth country in the world to send an indigenously produced satellite into orbit using a locally developed launcher. Israel was the eighth country to achieve this milestone, doing so in 1988. In 2011, Iran launched the Rasad satellite, designed to provide disaster monitoring, environmental data, meteorology and temperature measurements. According to Hamid Fazeli, the former head of the Iranian Space Agency, Rasad was Iran’s first satellite capable of taking images. However, its mission ended after three weeks when it failed to deliver any photographs. In February 2012, Iran launched the Navid satellite, reportedly tasked with capturing images from 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) above Earth. A second version, the Tadbir satellite, was planned but never succeeded. Navid itself burned up in the atmosphere, and the launch was deemed a failure. Another Iranian satellite, Fajr, was launched in 2015 from the Semnan Space Center using the Safir launcher, capable of carrying small satellites weighing up to 50 kilograms. However, Fajr’s operational life was short-lived. Several other satellites have also faced failed launches, including Tolou 1 from the Imam Khomeini Base in 2017, Payam in 2019, Dousti in 2019 and Zafar 1 in 2020. These setbacks highlight the challenges Iran continues to face in developing a robust space program. Despite these failures, Iran achieved a significant breakthrough in 2020 with the launch of Noor 1, the first satellite developed by the IRGC. Noor 1 orbits Earth every 90 minutes and is capable of surveillance missions. It was launched using the Qased satellite launcher, a new system developed by the IRGC. The program has since expanded with subsequent launches of Noor 2 and Noor 3. Iran-Russia space cooperation The Khayyam satellite, an Iranian satellite built by a Russian company at the request of the Iranian Space Agency, underscores the deepening ties between Tehran and Moscow. Launched into orbit in 2022, Iranian officials claimed the satellite would be used solely for civilian purposes. However, Western officials warned at the time that it could enable Iran to spy on targets in Israel and across the Middle East. Equipped with high-resolution imaging capabilities, Khayyam can capture photos with a resolution of approximately 70 centimeters per pixel. The technology used for satellite launchers could accelerate the timeline for developing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), as both rely on similar technology. Such long-range missiles could eventually carry nuclear warheads. 'The fact that Iran has access to observation satellites with decent resolution and the ability to share this data with its allies in the region is not ideal,' said Inbar. 'There are two aspects to consider: one is infrastructure intelligence, such as monitoring the construction of facilities and bases in Israel, which is valuable for Iran. The second is the potential to deliver near-real-time intelligence under certain conditions.' Another issue lies in the development of satellite launchers. The U.S. has accused Iran of violating United Nations Security Council resolutions with its space launches, asserting that the technology used for satellite launchers could accelerate the timeline for developing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), as both rely on similar technology. Such long-range missiles could eventually carry nuclear warheads. One of the most significant developments in recent years has been the creation of a new satellite launcher by the IRGC, according to Inbar. 'It’s called Qaem 100, with an upgraded version, Qaem 105, in the works,' he explained. 'This satellite launcher uses solid fuel for all its stages—technology that is also used in long-range ballistic missiles capable of reaching distances of 5,000 kilometers or more.' Inbar noted that there is no pressing technological need for a satellite launcher of this kind. 'The fact that it was developed, especially by the IRGC, suggests that it is a way to advance long-range missile technologies under the guise of civilian purposes,' he said. In May, Ali Jafar Abadi, head of the IRGC’s aerospace division, announced that the Qaem 105 would be operational by next spring, calling it 'one of Iran’s most important projects.' He added that the Qaem 105 would be capable of carrying twice the payload of its predecessor, the Qaem 100. According to Inbar, Iran’s financial investment in these areas is driving its progress. 'Iran is allocating significant funds and making advancements,' he said. 'In ballistic missiles, satellite launchers and ground infrastructure, as well as advanced drones, Iran is achieving tangible results.'

Distracted by mobile phone, air traffic controller nearly leads t...	Air Force dismisses reserve air traffic controller and sentences him to 8 days’ detention after probe into last month’s near-collision between 2 armed F-16 jets; military appoints colonel-led inquiry to further investigate incident An Israeli Air Force (IAF) investigation published Friday revealed that a critical procedural lapse by a reserve air traffic controller nearly caused a collision between two armed F-16 fighter jets at Ramat David Airbase last month. The probe found that the controller, who was distracted by his mobile phone, failed to follow standard safety protocols, granting one jet clearance for takeoff while simultaneously allowing another to cross the runway. The near-miss was averted when the pilot of the departing aircraft swerved, avoiding the other jet by just a few hundred feet. One of the jets involved was carrying a brigadier general, who leads the IAF’s strike division, along with three senior officers. Audio from the incident captured the general questioning the control tower: 'Did you see that jet on the runway?' The controller was sentenced to eight days of detention and removed from his position. While some IAF officials criticized the penalty as insufficient given the severity of the safety breach, others defended it, citing the ongoing wartime conditions. The report noted that the controller had a history of professional lapses, which raised concerns among senior officials. 'For far less severe violations, soldiers are often sentenced to longer detention,' one IAF source said. Following the investigation, the IAF implemented immediate safety measures and enhanced oversight at control towers. The Air Force commander has also appointed a colonel to lead a broader inquiry into the incident. 'The investigation yielded actionable lessons, which were promptly applied,' the military said in a statement, emphasizing that operations resumed quickly after the incident.

France appeals court ruling allowing Israeli firms at defense sho...	Paris appeals court ruling permitting Israeli companies to participate in defense exhibitions, aiming to block their involvement in future events; Israeli Manufacturers Association vows to fight appeal, calling it discriminatory and inconsistent with democratic values The French government on Friday filed an appeal against a court ruling that permitted Israeli companies to participate in defense exhibitions, following controversy and criticism of President Emmanuel Macron over the initial ban. The move aims to block Israeli firms from taking part in future defense events, including the prestigious Paris Air Show. The appeal, submitted by a government representative for the Paris Prefect of Police, challenges the administrative court’s authority to decide on French government policy. The court’s earlier decision had overturned a prohibition on Israeli companies exhibiting at events such as the recent Euronaval maritime defense show. Although Euronaval concluded last week, the French government’s appeal seeks to prevent Israeli participation in upcoming exhibitions, with the Paris Air Show — one of the world’s largest defense and aerospace events — likely at the forefront of its concerns. In late October, the court ruled decisively in favor of a petition by the Israeli Manufacturers Association, Israel Shipyards and the Israel-France Chamber of Commerce, allowing Israeli firms to participate in Euronaval. In response to the appeal, the Manufacturers Association announced it would continue to fight the French government’s efforts to exclude Israeli companies. 'We regret that French leaders have failed to grasp the message from previous cases: we will not allow anyone to remove or sideline us from the international defense stage,' said Dr. Ron Tomer, president of the Manufacturers Association of Israel. 'Israel is a proud sovereign state, equal to any other in the global community, and we would expect that a country like France, which shares democratic values with Israel, including principles of equality and justice, would not discriminate against Israeli companies compared to those from other nations.' Tomer criticized the appeal as an attempt to set the stage for excluding Israeli companies from the Paris Air Show, adding, 'We have retained top legal experts in France and will fight in every court necessary to ensure justice and equality. The Israeli flag will proudly fly at every exhibition.'

IAEA chief visits two nuclear sites during Iran trip	Grossi visits the Natanz nuclear plant and the Fordow enrichment site, which is dug into a mountain around 100 km (60 miles) south of the capital Tehran The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog visited two Iranian nuclear sites on Friday as part of a visit to Iran, ahead of an expected European diplomatic push over Tehran's atomic activities before Donald Trump's return to the White House. Earlier International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi met with Iran's president Masoud Pezeshkian. During the visit, Iran's foreign minister told Grossi that Tehran is willing to resolve outstanding disputes over its nuclear program but won't succumb to pressure. Grossi visited the Natanz nuclear plant and the Fordow enrichment site, which is dug into a mountain around 100 km (60 miles) south of the capital Tehran, state media reported, without giving details. Relations between Tehran and the IAEA have soured over several long-standing issues including Iran barring the agency's uranium-enrichment experts from the country and its failure to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites. 'The ball is in the EU/E3 court,' Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi wrote on X following talks in Tehran with Grossi on Thursday, referring to three European countries - France, Britain and Germany - which represent the West alongside the United States at nuclear talks. 'Willing to negotiate based on our national interest and inalienable rights, but not ready to negotiate under pressure and intimidation,' Araqchi said. Trump's return to office as U.S. president in January upends nuclear diplomacy with Iran, which had stalled under the outgoing administration of Joe Biden after months of indirect talks. During Trump's previous tenure, Washington ditched a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers that curbed Tehran's nuclear work in exchange for relief from international sanctions. Trump has not fully spelled out whether he will continue his 'maximum pressure' policy on Iran when he takes office. The U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear pact in 2018 and the reimposition of sanctions prompted Tehran to violate limitations on its uranium enrichment - seen by the West as a disguised effort to develop nuclear weapons capability. Tehran is now enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to the roughly 90% required for an atom bomb. Tehran says its nuclear work is purely for peaceful purposes.

Dahieh destruction equal to 2006 war'; watch building destroyed ...	Officials in Beirut estimate total rebuild cost for Lebanon after the war could reach three billion dollars and take up to five years; IDF carries out repeated strikes on Beirut's Hezbollah stronghold The IDF on Friday afternoon posted another warning to the residents of Beirut's Dahieh quarter to leave the area ahead of an Israeli strike on the Hezbollah stronghold. The IDF carried out at least six bombings of the sector of Lebanon's capital in the morning hours after warning civilians away. Buildings were taken down in the attacks. According to a report in the Hezbollah-affiliated Al Akhbar newspaper the damage to the Dahieh so far, is estimated to be $630 million while the cost of rebuilding all areas of the country, damaged in Israeli attacks could reach three billion dollars. This is equal to the damage at the end of the 2006 Second Lebanon War. Al Akhbar said that in the previous war some 246 buildings were destroyed in the Dahieh while as of the end of October 2024, some 220 buildings were already destroyed. Lebanese officials estimated that rebuilding after the fighting ends could take three to five years. Israeli security officials said they believed Hezbollah and the caretaker government in Beirut would not agree to Israel's demand for freedom to operate in Lebanon if the agreement under negotiations. Israel did agree for Lebanese army troops to be armed by the U.S., France and Britain who will be guarantors to the agreement and partners to its enforcement. Israeli and American officials said an agreement could be reached within weeks and a draft of the deal was delivered to Lebanon's prime minister and the speaker of parliament who is negotiating on behalf of Hezbollah. Officials in Jerusalem remained skeptical about the Lebanese military's ability to act against the Iran-backed terror group despite Washington's confidence that they would succeed. The level of trust in Lebanon's troops is low. Hezbollah, the officials say, was be able to carry on the fighting and would not rush to accept a deal. In the meantime, the IDF continued its military pressure and its efforts to remove as many of Hezbollah's capabilities as possible. On Friday, Hezbollah fired rockets at Haifa and its surrounding areas twice since the morning hours and the Galilee was also repeated under attack. Sources confirmed to the Qatari Al Araby al Jadeed channel on Friday that a draft of the agreement under negotiations was delivered to Beirut. 'The American mediation has made no progress on a cease-fire between Hezbollah and Israel, the channel said. 'Lebanon rejects any IDF freedom to operate in its territory after an agreement is agreed. Hezbollah refused German participation in the countries overseeing the deal.' Mukati and Berri met with Ali Larijani, the visiting Iranian official who said Iran stands with Lebanon's government, its military and Hezbollah against Israel's aggression. 'We will support any decision taken by Hezbollah and the government in Beirut,' Larijani said. 'We want to solve problems and Netanyahu wants to destroy things. Hezbollah is strong and the Lebanese are great people and we support the resistance.

Canadian Groups Accuse Pro-Israel Charities of ‘War Crimes'	Five pro-Israel Canadian charities are accused of supporting settler violence in a report, a claim mainstream Jewish organizations argue stokes antisemitism and requires government intervention A consortium of anti-Zionist groups operating in Canada has launched a campaign to discredit five charitable organizations supporting Israel. At a press conference held in Toronto this past Friday, Independent Jewish Voices Canada (IJV Canada) and Just Peace Advocates released a report accusing pro-Israel charities of aiding and abetting terrorism and war crimes. Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur for the Palestinian territories, spoke at the event alongside the report’s co-author, Miles Howe, assistant professor of critical criminology at Brock University; Khaled Mouammar, Palestinian-Canadian founder of the Canadian Arab Federation; Anver Emon, professor of law and history at the University of Toronto; and Alice Klein, a member of IJV Canada. The report, titled 'Under the Guise of Charity: Canadian Funding for War Crimes in Occupied Palestine,' targets five Canadian charities that support Israel, including the Mizrachi Organization of Canada and the Jewish Heritage Foundation of Canada. It alleges that these groups are violating Canadian tax law by using funds to engage in settler violence and land expropriation and to incentivize military enlistment in Israel. Richard Marceau, vice president and general counsel for the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs in Ottawa, said that the event was part of an attempt by left-wing organizations to smear mainstream Jews. 'The thinking goes that if you are pro-Israel, you are pro-genocide,' he said. Marceau described IJV Canada, which supports the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement, as a fringe organization associated with antisemites. The ultimate aim of IJV and similar groups is to 'scare Jews from engaging with the Jewish community and organizations through bullying and harassment,' Marceau said. Canadian laws regarding charitable giving are significantly more stringent than equivalent laws in the United States. This week, the Jewish National Fund’s Canadian branch (JNF Canada) lost an appeal to retain its charitable status, prompting jubilation in pro-Palestinian circles. An audit by the Canadian Revenue Agency, the local equivalent of the IRS, found that JNF Canada was illegally supporting the Israeli military and Israeli activities in the West Bank. For as long as any Canadian charities are allowed to fund illegal settler groups and the Israeli army, we’ll be continuing to push on this file Corey Balsam, national coordinator of IJV Canada, said that 1,200 people tuned into the livestreamed press conference. He said that the media has been reluctant to cover the investigation of pro-Israel charities. 'We’re hoping this will serve as a bit of a turning point,' he said. IJV Canada has been working on getting its report into the hands of public officials and pursuing policy options, Balsam noted. 'For as long as any Canadian charities are allowed to fund illegal settler groups and the Israeli army, we’ll be continuing to push on this file,' he said. Rabbi Steven Wernick, who serves the Beth Tzedec Congregation not far from where the press conference was held, said that antisemitism has been on the rise in Canada. 'Increased security measures are costing us $200,000 more a year. We see what’s happening in the streets,' Wernick told The Media Line. He said it was 'disconcerting' that Jews were involved in the leadership of some of the anti-Zionist groups attempting to delegitimize Jewish charities. 'It will be a test of the CRA to see if it falls prey to insidious attacks,' he said. Wernick noted that 90% of Jews in Toronto identify as Zionists. Canada is currently home to around 390,000 Jews, making it the fourth-largest Jewish community in the world after Israel, the US, and France. About 200,000 of Canada’s Jews live in Toronto, including a particularly high concentration of Holocaust survivors. Lynda Kraar, one Jewish resident of Toronto, recalled learning the lesson from her Holocaust survivor parents that antisemitism never disappears but only goes underground. 'With antisemitism, it’s not a question of if but when,' she said. You want to attack me because I’m a Jew? I’ve got news for you. I know what antisemitism is and I’m not willing to allow it to happen again. A Holocaust memoir written by Kraar’s mother was published by the Azrieli Foundation, an organization that is now vulnerable to having its charitable status revoked in Canada. 'You want to attack me because I’m a Jew? I’ve got news for you. I know what antisemitism is and I’m not willing to allow it to happen again,' Kraar said. Marceau said that Canadian antisemitism has three main sources: the far right, the far left, and Islamism. One form of antisemitism in some left-wing circles involves denying that antisemitism is a real form of oppression, he said. This past July, lawmaker Anthony Housefather was appointed as special adviser on Jewish community relations and antisemitism. Housefather has been a vocal and relentless defender of Canadian Jews and Israel, sometimes opposing stances taken by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. 'There has been no time in my lifetime when Jewish Canadians have felt as threatened as they do today,' Housefather said in his acceptance speech. Trudeau, who has often upset the Canadian Jewish community with his harsh statements about Israel’s actions in the ongoing war, described Canadian antisemitism as 'terrifying' in a statement last month. 'We have seen Jewish schools in Montreal shot at, synagogues firebombed, Jewish community centers picketed, bomb threats in Jewish schools in Toronto,' Marceau said. 'The Montreal Jewish community asked and got an injunction for 34 institutions to have demonstrations not allowed within 100 meters from them. For an injunction to be granted is quite an extraordinary thing.' Anti-Israel activists also picketed Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto and displayed Hamas and Hezbollah flags at various educational institutions, Marceau added. He said his organization is ready to take on IJV Canada and Just Peace Advocates. 'The Canadian government should be looking at those groups in Canada that are openly racist, preaching violence, spreading toxicity and hate, and tearing apart the social fabric,' he said.

Islamic Jihad posts new video of hostage Sasha Trufanov	Trufanov's family has not yet approved publication of the video; clip comes two days after an earlier video is released in which the hostage refers to himself as a prisoner; he speaks to his family and describes the difficulty of over a year in captivity The Islamic Jihad terror group in Gaza on Friday posted a new video of hostage Sacha trufanov held since his abduction last October. The video came two days after an earlier clip was released, as part of the PIJ's psychological warfare. Trufanov is seen near a picture of Ultra-Orthodox lawmaker and leader of the Shas Party Aryeh Deri. His family has not yet approved publication of the video or its contents. In the earlier clip released on Wednesday Sasha addresses his family and talks about the difficulty of the long time in captivity. 'A year that I have been here in captivity, a year in which there is a shortage of food and water, no electricity. Now even basic hygiene products, such as soap and shampoo, have run out. I have a skin problem that did not exist before because of this situation. I want to remind the citizens of Israel, every time you eat something or drink something, remember us hostages, we don't have this opportunity to enjoy the food and water you eat or drink,' he said. He speaks of himself as a 'prisoner' and also referred to the suffering of the citizens in Gaza. 'When you make it difficult for them, you also make it difficult for us,' he said.

Trump ally Musk meets with Iranian officials, report	Iranian officials say Trump win could be an opportunity to change in tone in U.S. Iran relations hoping for a deal to be made; Iranian foreign minister says nuclear talks can proceed with courage and good will Elon Musk met with Iran's ambassador to the UN Amir Saeid Iravani on Monday in New York, the New York Times said late on Thursday, citing two Iranian officials. The meeting lasted more than an hour and was held at a secret location. It was described as 'positive' and 'good news.' According to one of the Iranian officials, it was Musk who had requested the meeting and the ambassador picked the site. Musk did not respond to questions from the Times. 'We do not comment on reports of private meetings that did or did not occur.' Trump's communications director Steven Cheung said. Karoline Leavitt, the transition spokeswoman for the incoming Trump-Vance administration, said in a statement: 'The American people re-elected President Trump because they trust him to lead our country and restore peace through strength around the world. When he returns to the White House, he will take the necessary action to do just that.' The Iranian officials told the Times that the meeting was an opportunity for Iran to avoid sitting directly with an American official, although Musk will soon join the new administration as co-director of a government efficiency agency that is planned. An official in Iran's Foreign Ministry said that Ambassador Iravani suggested that Musk should obtain sanctions exemptions from the U.S. Treasury and bring some of his businesses to Tehran. Iran’s mission to the United Nations said it would not publicly comment on the meeting. 'An early direct meeting between a senior Iranian official and Mr. Musk raises the possibility of a change in tone between Tehran and Washington under the Trump administration, despite a charged history between the president-elect and Iran,' the New York Times wrote. During his campaign Trump criticized the Biden administration for lifting sanctions on Iran, that were part of Trump's 'maximum pressure' campaign during his first term as president. Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal and imposed severe economic sanctions. He was also the president who gave the order to assassinate Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps chief Qasem Soleimani in 2020. In September Trump said the U.S. must make a deal with Iran adding he would have been ready to reach an agreement with Iran within a week after the elections were he reelected in 2020. ' I would’ve made a fair deal with Iran. I was gonna get along with Iran. The deal was simple: Iran can’t have a nuclear missile. It cannot have that nuclear capability,' he said. Iran was also behind an attempt to assassinate Trump recently but after he won the elections, some in Iran, including officials who spoke to the paper said his term could be used as a diplomatic opportunity and that a deal, could be reached with him adding that the president-elect like succeeding in deals where others have failed. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Arghachi said in a post last Thursday that differences could be resolved through cooperation and dialogue. 'We agreed to proceed with courage and good will. Iran has never left the negotiation table on its peaceful nuclear program,' he said in a post on X after a meeting in Tehran with IAEA chief Rafael Grossi.

European antisemitism surges: Dutch police continue to arrest pro...	Pro-Palestinian rioters were being detained by Dutch authorities under the country's emergency ban on protests It’s been almost a week since antisemitic violence erupted in the streets of Amsterdam, where Israeli soccer fans were targeted and attacked. Dutch police continue to arrest pro-Palestinian protesters who are defying the protest ban in the Netherlands. On Thursday, for the fifth day in a row, pro-Palestinian rioters were being detained by Dutch authorities under the country's emergency ban on protests. Amsterdam imposed the ban following a violent attack on Israeli soccer fans in the city. The victims, including women and children, were ambushed by mobs of Dutch immigrants, primarily from North Africa, in an assault that left five people hospitalized with severe injuries. After widespread condemnation from European leaders over the attacks on Israelis and Jews, many Dutch residents used the unrest as an opportunity to defy the law and participate in anti-Israel protests. Since last week's clashes, Dutch police have detained hundreds of demonstrators under the new emergency measures. With antisemitism on the rise across Europe, reactions have been deeply divided. Many have expressed outrage at the escalating violence, while others openly welcome it, as evidenced by social media posts and actions on the streets of Amsterdam.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1gti5vfye	2024-11-15T00:42:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/11/14/rJezowQz1l/rJezowQz1l_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Trump could destroy Iran’s nukes, bring peace with Saudi Arabia. ...	Shiri Fein-Grossman: Israel’s current objective in Lebanon is to eliminate as many Hezbollah operatives as possible The Trump administration could deter Iran, inflict substantial damage on the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, and join forces with Israel to destroy the country’s nuclear program. The key question is how far the Trump administration is willing to go, according to Shiri Fein-Grossman, former head of the Foreign Policy Branch, Regional Affairs in the National Security Council. If Trump achieves some or all of these goals, 'that would signal to Saudi Arabia that America is willing to use force to stem Iran, to support its allies in the region, and it would create a new reality in the Middle East,' Fein-Grossman said. 'Without that, it will be very hard to bring Saudi Arabia to the table without talking about the Palestinian issue, the two-state solution that Saudi Arabia is still hoping to achieve.' Fein-Grossman spoke to ILTV News on Thursday. She told the station that Israel’s current objective in Lebanon is to eliminate as many Hezbollah operatives as possible and destroy as many of the group’s rockets as it can before the war is halted by a ceasefire. However, she added that the bigger question is what happens the day after: Will Israel have the freedom to act when it perceives a credible threat? 'What’s stalling getting to a ceasefire now is the Israeli freedom to act whenever it sees a threat,' she said. 'The main thing is, what will happen the day after? Will Israel be able to maintain its own security for the first time?'

The rise of 'born-again' Jews	Julie Platt on 'the surge' of Jews returning to their roots, showing up in numbers the American Jewish community hasn’t seen in years Since the October 7 massacre in Israel, there has been a rise in 'born-again Jews,' according to Julie Platt, chairwoman of the Jewish Federations of North America. 'We speak a lot about ‘the surge’ since October 7,' she told ILTV News earlier this week. 'There are many, many born-again Jews who remembered who they were, remembered their affiliation, their religion, and their community. People are showing up in numbers we haven't seen in quite some time. 'But it's on us, the Jewish community, to make them feel welcome, help them find their place, and foster a sense of belonging,' Platt added. On October 7, approximately 6,000 Hamas terrorists and Gazan civilians infiltrated Israel, slaughtering 1,200 people and kidnapping over 250 others. Since then, antisemitism has surged worldwide, even striking communities that once believed they were immune. Speaking from the Jewish Federations’ General Assembly, Platt said the 2,500 attendees focused heavily on community engagement as a critical part of combating antisemitism. 'We have to remember who our partners are—those we may not have been in conversation with—and work hard to strengthen our allied communities,' she said. For the first time, JFNA hosted a panel featuring Christian supporters of Israel. The evangelical Christian community has long been pro-Israel, rooted in the biblical passage from Genesis 12:3, where God says, 'I will bless those who bless you.' However, more liberal segments of the Jewish community have often been hesitant to partner with Christians, citing differences in values and fears of proselytizing. Since October 7, however, many Jews have become more open to these alliances, recognizing the need for all of Israel’s friends. 'We had many allied communities here,' Platt noted. 'One of the most impactful for me was the Native American ally community, which wanted to be here to stand with us. The Christian community has consistently been by our side, with voices like [American actress and producer] Patricia Heaton and many ministers, reverends, and clergy across the country. We need to appreciate and grow that support, and we were proud to give it a voice here.' While identifying new supporters of Israel and the Jewish people, Platt emphasized that the Federation’s work is far from over. The organization has already distributed more than $700 million of the $850 million raised to support Israel since the war began. 'We're all aware that this is a long game, and we can’t rest until Israel is recovered, rebuilt, and as strong as it can be,' Platt said. 'This moment has re-energized us to continue the work ahead.' One of the top priorities, she said, will be addressing the mental health needs of Israelis. 'There is not an Israeli citizen who hasn’t been affected by trauma,' Platt stressed. 'Sadly, through this conflict, I don’t think we’ve even begun to address the trauma, stress, and mental health services we must provide. And then there’s 100 more things.' Families of the 101 hostages still held in Gaza participated in the event, sharing their stories and urging action to bring their loved ones home. Although no government representatives attended, President Isaac Herzog was present, along with many leaders from Israeli nonprofits and other organizations. Platt emphasized that the responsibility for the hostages weighs heavily on the American Jewish community—'not just as a collective, but name by name, person by person.'

Trump approves outline of pending cease-fire deal in Lebanon	Incoming president hopes agreement would be implemented before he takes office; officials in Washington and Jerusalem await Lebanon's response to the outline of the deal President elect Donald Trump gave his approval to the outline of the agreement being negotiated to bring a cease-fire to the fighting between Israel and the Hezbollah terror group in Lebanon, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. Israeli officials told the paper that Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, presented the outline of the agreement to Trump in their meeting last week and the incoming president expressed him hope that the agreement could come into effect before he took office on January 20, 2025. The U.S. presented the outline to the government in Beirut on Thursday. Officials in Washington and in Jerusalem were awaiting their reply that could, according to the Israeli officials, come within days. U.S. President Joe Biden's special envoy, Amos Hochstein told the Lebanese that he would not arrive to Beirut if he did not believe the government there was prepared to seal the deal. Hochstein gave the head of Lebanon's caretaker government Najib Mukati and Speaker of parliament Nabih Berri, who was negotiating on behalf of Hezbollah, the draft of the agreement. According to a report in the Lebanese Al Jadeed channel, Berry delivered Lebanon's response and was 'optimistic about a cease-fire within days or a week,' but that report was removed quickly. The Hezbollah-affiliated Al Akhbar newspaper on Thursday reported that Berri and Mukati rejected Israel's demands for freedom to operate in Lebanon if the agreement that would be reached, would be violated and Hezbollah would return to South Lebanon or rebuild its military capabilities. The Lebanese demands, according to the report was an immediate cease-fire and the return of residents of the south to their villages, a complete withdrawal of all Israeli troops from the south and a ban on any IDF activity on Lebanese territory on land, in the air or at sea. Beirut's demand was also that there would be no amendment to UN resolution 1701 passed at the end of the 2006 Second Lebanon war. The IDF meanwhile continued its offensive in South Lebanon, operating in the second line of villages away from the Israeli border, to remove Hezbollah's capabilities to fire missiles and rockets at Israel. The IDF conducted more airstrikes on the Dahieh quarter in Beirut after repeated attacks there in recent days. The military said it was targeting Hezbollah weapons stores and production facilities. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held consultations with Dermer, Defense Minister Israel Katz and with his far-right coalition partners Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich to discuss both the Lebanon and Gaza fronts.

Exclusive - ‘Taken Us Back 200 Years’: Gazan Workers Blame Hamas	Gazan's who worked in Israel share stories of hardship amid devastation in the Strip, with lives and jobs lost under siege and war and reflect on past stability and the worsening crisis as conflict and shortages continue As Gaza endures its worst humanitarian crisis in decades, former Gazan workers who once relied on jobs in Israel are grappling with devastating loss and a future filled with uncertainty. Entire neighborhoods have been leveled, and much of Gaza’s infrastructure is in ruins as Israel’s intensified military campaign, coupled with an already crippling blockade, has left the Strip’s 2.3 million residents in dire straits. Sami, one of the displaced workers, describes how war has stripped away everything familiar: 'It is unbearable. Today, life is impossible. People don’t know how to cope. There is no money, no food. Everyone knows it. When a kilo of onions costs 60 shekels, it’s a catastrophe.' He noted that, while in Israel, he worked with both Arab and Jewish Israelis. He said some Jewish colleagues were surprised to work with a Gazan, but it did not prevent mutual interactions. 'When they asked how I got in, I explained that I had a permit,' he told The Media Line. 'We are clean people with no connections to Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Fatah, or any other organization. In Gaza, we worked honestly to support our families.' 'This is the result of having bad Islamists in power for years, like Hamas, and it has dragged us back 200 years,' Sami says, expressing frustration with the governing group in Gaza and the toll of ongoing hostilities. 'Israel also bears responsibility for our suffering. I have been imprisoned in Israeli jails, and we are caught in a never-ending cycle of violence. Now, we fight for scraps of bread and live in tents.' The escalating violence has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes, leaving many internally displaced and facing life in makeshift shelters. Originally from Amman, Sami recalled being caught at the border when hostilities erupted, unable to return home. 'The war started while I was at work,' he explaines. 'We wanted to leave. We didn’t know what to do because there were no crossings open.' After being detained by Israeli authorities for a month, Sami returned to Gaza to find that his home had been destroyed and that his wife and daughter were among those killed. Until recently, cross-border employment provided an economic lifeline for thousands of Gazans, many of whom worked in Israel’s construction and agricultural sectors. In 2021, 7,000 Gazans held Israeli work or trade permits. The following year, the permit quota was increased to 17,000, with a planned increase to 20,000. By 2023, 18,500 Palestinians had visas to enter Israel, but their access was revoked three days after the Hamas attack. Riyadh, 28, who was born in Turkey, has been living in the southern part of the Strip. He has not seen his father Sami for nine months during the war. He was a medical clown in Gaza and worked in Israel as a painter for 19 days before he got married. Fifteen days later, the war began. His 16-year-old wife was killed during the conflict. Riyadh strongly condemns Hamas for this. 'They started the war on October 7. If they had not initiated this, nothing would have happened,' he says. For Gazans like Sami, these jobs were essential, providing a steady income in a territory plagued by soaring unemployment and poverty. 'I had a permit and was officially employed in Israel,' he recalls, noting he earned approximately 500 shekels a day—a salary that allowed him and his family to live relatively comfortably. While the majority of workers have either fled Gaza or been killed, The Media Line was able to speak to a businessman who, for security reasons, is not being identified. He has two decades of experience in major industries in Gaza—and is now facing his fourth displacement. 'The period before the war was a symbol of good exchange and cohesion between the two sides. I had great hopes for the future and to continue like this,' he says. 'October 7 has destroyed all our dreams and communication on both sides. We blame both Israel and Hamas. They must stop the war immediately.' When asked why he hadn’t left the Strip, he says that he had 'many chances' to do so. He noted that he had been to 'the United States, China, and other places' but said he 'couldn’t leave' Gaza. 'Even after visiting Ramallah, I couldn’t stay there more than four days and had to return to Gaza,' he says. 'We will not leave; this is our land. I want a chance to live like everyone else. My message to the world is that I hope what I am enduring, along with the suffering of my people and children, will never happen again in history.' Hasan, another longtime worker, shares similar experiences from his 20-year tenure in a block factory in Israel, where he found stability and enough income to support his family in Gaza. 'It was generally good, and I earned enough to live a dignified life in Gaza,' he says. 'But now, we live like animals. This is the result of having bad Islamists in power, like Hamas. Israel also bears responsibility for our suffering.' Before this latest escalation, Gaza’s labor force had built a fragile but vital relationship with Israeli employers, bridging the gap between the two sides through economic interdependence. For some, this work symbolized a rare opportunity for interaction that transcended the usual hostilities. While many in Gaza hold Hamas responsible for the conflict, others, like Sami, are outspoken in their criticism of the group’s leadership. 'This is not a national movement; it is a betrayal,' he declares. Hasan echoed these sentiments, saying, 'We brought this on ourselves by creating groups like Hamas, who claim to represent Islam but know nothing of it. To me, the Jews are better than the Muslims ruling us here. ... True Islam would never justify their actions.'

Pro-Israel activists rally at Capitol, calling out Tlaib and Omar...	Wearing shirts calling for return of Israeli hostages, US Betar activists blast Progressive lawmakers for refusal to condemn terror group's violence; Omar hurls expletive at protesters in response Pro-Israel activists from the American branch of the Betar movement staged a protest at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, wrapped in Israeli flags and confronting Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar over their alleged support for Hamas following the terrorist group’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel. The activists wore shirts advocating for the release of hostages and knocked on the congresswomen’s doors, attempting to deliver pagers as symbolic 'gifts.' In response, Rep. Omar reportedly hurled an expletive at them. Rep. Tlaib summoned Capitol Police, who questioned the activists and confiscated the devices, which were presented as pagers in reference to a spree of detonations of explosive-laced pagers that killed dozens of Hezbollah operatives and maimed thousands of others in September. The protesters then followed Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, confronting her with questions about her alleged refusal to condemn Hamas and accusing her of supporting the organization despite its violence. One activist took a selfie with Omar, who smiled but was questioned by the activist, 'Why are you happy?' Another protester shouted, 'At least I don’t sleep with my brother,' referencing a long-disputed, unproven claim about Omar’s past marriage. Another shouted, 'Go to Gaza,' to which Omar reportedly replied, 'F*** you.' In a statement, Betar said, 'We went to Congress to confront jihadists, and Ilhan Omar told us to ‘go f*** ourselves,’ while Rashida Tlaib, who advocates defunding the police, called the police on us. We are fed up. Jews worldwide must stand up to these antisemites. Betar stands strong.'

Ben-Gvir presses Netanyahu to consider removing attorney general	National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to reconsider Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara's position, following her letter to Netanyahu regarding his authority over Ben-Gvir’s conduct. 'I urge the Prime Minister to reassess his stance on the tenure of Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara,' the far-right firebrand said, alleging that her 'inappropriate interference in government policy' and the reliance of government ministers on the attorney general for their continued appointments 'undermine the government’s ability to act in accordance with the public's interest rather than that of the legal establishment.' He accused Baharav-Miara of 'initiating an attempted coup against Israel’s elected government' and called on Netanyahu to consider her dismissal.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjkru1egke	2024-11-14T12:32:54-08:00

Ben & Jerry's says sues Unilever for silencing its support of Pal...	According to lawsuit, 'Ben & Jerry's has on four occasions attempted to publicly speak out in support of peace and human rights. Unilever has silenced each of these efforts'; lawsuit will make it harder for Unilever to sell the brand Ice cream brand Ben & Jerry's said in a lawsuit filed Wednesday that parent company Unilever has silenced its attempts to express support for Palestinian refugees and threatened to dismantle its board and sue its members over the issue. The lawsuit is the latest sign of the long-simmering tensions between Ben & Jerry's and consumer products maker Unilever, which is planning to spin out its ice cream business next year. The spin out would include the top-selling Vermont-based maker of Chubby Hubby, although experts on corporate governance said the brand's board, a centerpiece of the new lawsuit, could present challenges to the deal. A rift first erupted between Ben & Jerry's and Unilever in 2021 after the ice cream maker said it would stop selling its products in the West Bank because it was inconsistent with its values, a move that led some investors to divest their shares in Unilever. The ice cream maker then sued Unilever for selling its business in Israel to its licensee there, which allowed marketing in the West Bank and Israel to continue. That lawsuit was settled in 2022. In its new lawsuit, Ben & Jerry's says that Unilever has breached the terms of the 2022 settlement, which has remained confidential. As part of the agreement, however, Unilever is required to 'respect and acknowledge the Ben & Jerry's independent board's primary responsibility over Ben & Jerry's social mission,' according to the lawsuit. But, according to the lawsuit, 'Ben & Jerry's has on four occasions attempted to publicly speak out in support of peace and human rights. Unilever has silenced each of these efforts.' In response to Reuters' story, Unilever said in an emailed statement: 'Our heart goes out to all victims of the tragic events in the Middle East. We reject the claims made by B&J’s social mission board, and we will defend our case very strongly.' 'We would not comment further on this legal matter,' it added. The lawsuit was filed Thursday in New York federal court. Minor Myers, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law, said the tension between Ben & Jerry's and Unilever would be top of mind in a deal, particularly if Unilever's ice cream brands are acquired by a private equity firm or competitor company. 'The Ben & Jerry's situation, would be front of mind of any possible buyer,' Myers said. 'To the extent that Ben & Jerry's or a subsidiary wants to be liberated to say (what they want, it) may impact the sales of the flagship ice cream brand.' That would result in a lower valuation for Unilever's ice cream brands, Myers said. There are fewer concerns if the ice cream brands become a separate publicly traded company, Myers said. Ben & Jerry's said in the lawsuit it has tried to call for a ceasefire, support the safe passage of Palestinian refugees to Britain, back students protesting at U.S. colleges against civilian deaths in Gaza, and advocate for a halt in U.S. military aid to Israel, but has been blocked by Unilever. The independent board separately spoke out on some of those topics, but the company was muzzled, the lawsuit says. Ben & Jerry's said that Peter ter Kulve, Unilever's head of ice cream, said he was concerned about the 'continued perception of antisemitism' regarding the ice cream brand voicing its opinions on Gazan refugees, according to the lawsuit. Unilever was also required under the settlement agreement to make a total of $5 million in payments to Ben & Jerry's for the brand to make donations to human rights groups of its choosing, according to the lawsuit. Ben & Jerry's selected the left-leaning Jewish Voice for Peace and the San Francisco Bay Area Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, among others, the filing says. Unilever in August objected to the selections, saying that Jewish Voice for Peace was 'too critical of the Israeli government,' according to the lawsuit. Ben & Jerry's has positioned itself as socially conscious since Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield founded the company in a renovated gas station in 1978. It kept that mission after Unilever acquired it in 2000. Unilever's dozens of products include Dove soap, Hellmann's mayonnaise, Knorr bouillon cubes, Surf detergent and Vaseline petroleum jelly.

US submits Israel-Lebanon cease-fire draft as pressure on Hezboll...	US official stresses ‘deal in Lebanon more likely than hostage agreement’; Israeli officials expect Lebanon’s response within the coming days The United States on Thursday delivered a draft cease-fire proposal to Lebanon, developed in coordination with Israel, with officials in Jerusalem and Washington now awaiting Lebanon’s response. An Israeli official estimated a reply within days, while White House Special Envoy Amos Hochstein told Lebanese leaders he would not travel to Beirut unless assured Lebanon was ready to finalize an agreement. Hochstein submitted the draft to Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who is negotiating on behalf of Hezbollah. Meanwhile, the IDF has increased military pressure in Lebanon, operating in the second line of villages to further diminish Hezbollah’s capabilities, while continuing airstrikes in Syria and Beirut's Dahieh district. In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a high-level security meeting Thursday with Defense Minister Israel Katz and other key ministers, including Bezalel Smotrich, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Ron Dermer, discussing both the Lebanon cease-fire talks and ongoing operations in Gaza. A U.S. official familiar with the discussions said, 'A deal in Lebanon is more likely than a hostage agreement.' IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that Israel's objective is 'to clear Hezbollah’s terror infrastructure in southern Lebanon and ensure it cannot pose a threat to Israeli civilians.' Hagari emphasized that the IDF’s role is to create the conditions needed for the political leadership to reach a diplomatic solution. Defense Minister Katz reiterated Israel's goal of disarming Hezbollah, though other officials have avoided direct mention of this aim. Israeli officials are reportedly pushing for an agreement before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration. The potential agreement may include U.S.-led efforts to arm Lebanon's army, which would be tasked with addressing violations and dismantling Hezbollah’s infrastructure up to the Litani River. Meanwhile, rocket fire from Lebanon toward northern Israel has persisted in recent days, sometimes reaching central Israel and the Sharon region, but the IDF reported Thursday that daily rocket averages have dropped to below 100, down from over 150. The IDF attributed the decrease to intensified military pressure on Hezbollah’s launch capabilities, including targeted strikes on rocket launchers and firepower resources. On Monday’s 'Martyr’s Day,' Hezbollah claimed responsibility for 200 launches, while by 6 p.m. Thursday, it had taken responsibility for 18 separate attacks. The IDF said that since ground operations began, over 2,250 Hezbollah fighters, including several high-ranking commanders, have been killed, impacting the group’s ability to launch attacks. Israeli forces have faced heavy losses since the start of the ground incursion into Lebanon, with 67 killed, including 16 civilians and 51 soldiers—41 of whom died in Lebanese territory.

Some 88 Democratic lawmakers urged U.S. President Joe Biden to sanction members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government over anti-Palestinian violence in the West Bank, according to a letter released on Thursday. Urging Biden to send a message to U.S. partners before he leaves office, the members of Congress said Israeli cabinet members Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir had incited violence by Israeli settlers. 'We write to express our deep concern about the rise in settler violence, settlement expansion, and measures adopted to weaken the Palestinian Authority and otherwise destabilize the West Bank,' they said in the letter. The letter, was signed by 17 senators and 71 House members. The letter was dated Oct. 29 but made public on Thursday because the lawmakers had not had a response from the White House.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1c0000c7fjx	2024-11-14T11:11:39-08:00

IDF reports drop in rocket fire, as Hezbollah casualties and Leba...	Military says Hezbollah rocket fire down to under 100 daily launches, emphasizing its goal to push terror group as far back as possible; cautious cease-fire talks continue as World Bank estimates Lebanon's war damages at $8 billion, with 100,000 homes damaged Rocket fire from Lebanon toward northern Israel has persisted in recent days, sometimes reaching central Israel and the Sharon region, but the IDF reported Thursday that daily rocket averages have dropped to below 100, down from over 150. The IDF attributed the decrease to intensified military pressure on Hezbollah’s launch capabilities, including targeted strikes on rocket launchers and firepower resources. On Monday’s 'Martyr’s Day,' Hezbollah claimed responsibility for 200 launches, while by 6 p.m. Thursday, it had taken responsibility for 18 separate attacks. The IDF said that since ground operations began, over 2,250 Hezbollah fighters, including several high-ranking commanders, have been killed, impacting the group’s ability to launch attacks. Israeli forces have faced heavy losses since the start of the ground incursion into Lebanon, with 67 killed, including 16 civilians and 51 soldiers—41 of whom died in Lebanese territory. 'We had five encounters with Hezbollah fighters since yesterday,' the IDF reported on Thursday. 'We are coordinating military moves with diplomatic efforts, which is crucial.' The IDF highlighted the complexity of combat in built-up areas and emphasized ongoing lessons learned to reduce casualties. Most current ground activity is within five to six kilometers of the Lebanese border, in western and eastern sectors of southern Lebanon. 'Hezbollah incursions into northern Israel could persist for years,' IDF officials warned. The military clarified that ground forces are targeting underground complexes housing advanced weaponry, where airstrikes alone may achieve only partial success. 'We may not eliminate every threat, but we’re advancing well,' the IDF added. Energy Minister Eli Cohen, in an interview with Reuters, said that Israel is closer than ever to reaching an agreement to end fighting in Lebanon and push Hezbollah away from the border, while insisting that Israel maintains the right to act military should it be violated. A key sticking point for Israel, he said, is ensuring it retains freedom of action should Hezbollah return to border areas. 'We will be less forgiving than in the past over attempts to create strongholds in territory near Israel. That's how we will be, and so that is certainly how we will act.' In terms of a mechanism to enforce the agreement, Cohen said: 'There are discussions, but it has not been agreed upon.' An Israeli official familiar with ongoing cease-fire negotiations said Thursday that progress is being made, but cautioned that a resolution remains uncertain. 'We’re closer than we were yesterday, but not near enough to say it will end very soon,' the official noted, adding that military assessments remain a factor, with decisions hinging on whether to 'end hostilities now' or after clearing Hezbollah strongholds in southern Lebanon. He further said that officials aim to finalize the agreement before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump assumes office in January. Meanwhile, the World Bank reported Thursday that Lebanon’s war damages from the year-long conflict now exceed $8 billion, with almost 100,000 homes damaged or destroyed. According to the report, covering the period from October 2023—when Hezbollah joined Hamas in attacks on Israel—through October 2024, at least 99,209 residential units were impacted, primarily in southern Lebanese regions like Tyre, Nabatieh, Sidon, Bint Jbeil and Marjayoun. The World Bank’s analysis placed losses from damages to sectors like tourism and agriculture at $5.1 billion and destruction to infrastructure at an additional $3.4 billion. The final economic toll is expected to be significantly higher, compounding Lebanon's ongoing economic crisis, which has pushed most of its population below the poverty line since 2019. Lebanon also faces a growing displacement crisis, with approximately 1.6 million residents forced from homes situated in Hezbollah-occupied areas in southern Lebanon due to IDF operations.

US hands Lebanon draft truce proposal, two sources say	The U.S. ambassador to Lebanon submitted a draft truce proposal to Lebanon's speaker of parliament Nabih Berri on Thursday to halt fighting between terrorist group Hezbollah and Israel, two political sources told Reuters, without revealing details. The U.S. has sought to broker a cease-fire that would end hostilities between its ally Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah, but efforts have yet to yield a result. Israel launched a stepped-up air and ground campaign in late September after cross-border clashes in parallel with the Gaza war. U.S. ambassador Lisa Johnson met with Berri, a Hezbollah ally and the typical conduit for diplomacy with the group, on Thursday to submit Washington's first written proposal in at least several weeks, two senior Lebanese political sources said. 'It is a draft to get observations from the Lebanese side,' one of the sources told Reuters. Neither source could provide details on the contents of the proposal.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1chcp7fke	2024-11-14T10:24:44-08:00	
Coup in every sense of the word': Coalition leaders reject calls...	Lawmakers reject any move to declare PM temporarily unfit during trial testimony, calling move legally unfounded; 'Only the people, through their elected representatives in Knesset, can decide who will lead them and serve as prime minister' Leaders of the coalition parties issued an unusual statement Thursday night, firmly rejecting any notion that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be temporarily declared unfit whenever he testifies in his ongoing corruption trial. 'We categorically reject any attempt to declare the prime minister unfit, even for a very short period,' the statement read. 'Any such declaration lacks legal foundation and is therefore invalid.' They warned that a temporary declaration of unfitness would be akin to a 'coup in every sense of the word' and argued that Netanyahu must continue leading Israel's security and diplomatic efforts, which they deem a matter of national interest. 'We stand and will continue to stand guard over democracy. Only the people, through their elected representatives in the Knesset, can decide who will lead them and serve as prime minister.' The statement was signed by Justice Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Yariv Levin, representing Netanyahu's Likud Party, along with the heads of all other coalition parties, including newly appointed Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar. The decision to issue the statement followed a ruling by Jerusalem District Court judges that Netanyahu’s testimony will proceed as scheduled on December 2, despite the ongoing war. Netanyahu faces three graft cases, commonly referred to as Case 1000, Case 2000 and Case 4000, involving charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. In Case 1000, he is accused of receiving lavish gifts from a billionaire friend in exchange for favors; Case 2000 alleges negotiations with a newspaper publisher for favorable coverage; and Case 4000, the most serious, involves claims he granted regulatory benefits to a telecom giant in exchange for positive media coverage from its news outlet. Why is such an option even considered? Ironically, Netanyahu's own claims about the impact of wartime responsibilities on his trial testimony have intensified the possibility of a temporary incapacitation declaration, legal experts say. In a recent request to postpone his testimony, Netanyahu argued that the ongoing war prevents him from fully preparing with his defense attorney and makes it impossible for him to disconnect and testify for seven hours across multiple days. In a hearing on Wednesday, Netanyahu’s lawyer, Amit Hadad, said, 'A country cannot be governed in wartime while its prime minister is on the witness stand.' However, in 2020, Netanyahu argued before the High Court of Justice that he could manage both state affairs and a trial. While that stance applied in peacetime, he now acknowledges that managing both during wartime is not feasible. If Netanyahu maintains this position, Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara could issue a letter mandating that, while testifying, he temporarily transfer his powers to another minister, as would be done if he were undergoing medical treatment. Netanyahu would resume his duties at the end of each court day. Should he resist, petitions may be submitted to the High Court, demanding he step aside temporarily during his testimony. Netanyahu faces a challenging legal position, given his own admission that wartime duties and testimony are incompatible. Earlier this year, the High Court ruled that a new amendment regarding incapacitation would apply only from the next Knesset. However, Netanyahu’s acknowledgment that war-time testimony creates an incapacity could complicate his case. His attorney may argue that declaring a prime minister incapacitated during war—even temporarily—would be unreasonable and against public interest, suggesting instead that another witness take the stand in his place. The High Court, however, may find it difficult to accept this procedural claim, as the district court has already determined that Netanyahu must testify and the High Court is not an appeals court for district court rulings.

Drone from Lebanon enters Israeli airspace, leading to 40-minute pursuit before crashing near Eliakim, where 2 soldiers moderately hurt; incursion triggers widespread alert sirens and prompts aerial monitoring along Israel’s northern coast A drone infiltrating Israeli airspace from Lebanon struck near Eliakim in the Megiddo region on Thursday, wounding two Israeli soldiers moderately, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari reported Thursday evening. The drone’s incursion prompted a 40-minute chase and triggered alert sirens in towns across northern Israel, from Nahariya near the Lebanese border and Acre to the Haifa Bay area and down to Zichron Ya'akov. The incident began with sirens sounding in multiple cities, initially in towns close to the Lebanese border and moving southward as the drone progressed along Israel’s coastline. Low-flying helicopters and increased aerial activity were reported by residents in affected areas, including Yokneam, Kiryat Tivon, Or Akiva and parts of the Megiddo Regional Council. The IDF confirmed that the UAV had entered Israel from Lebanon and was closely monitored as it traveled south. The incident concluded near Eliakim, where the drone ultimately crashed. Authorities issued precautionary warnings to residents across the region, underscoring ongoing security concerns.

Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of war crimes over Gaza displac...	Israeli authorities have caused a forced displacement of Palestinian people in Gaza to an extent that constitutes war crimes and crimes against humanity, Human Rights Watch said in a report on Thursday. Israel, in response, accused the organization of using rhetoric that is 'completely false and detached from reality.' The report said that 'Human Rights Watch found that forced displacement has been widespread, and the evidence shows it has been systematic and part of a state policy. Such acts also constitute crimes against humanity.' The law of armed conflict forbids the forcible displacement of civilian populations from occupied territory, unless necessary for the security of civilians or imperative military reasons. For the past month, Israeli troops have moved tens of thousands of people from areas in the north of the enclave as they have sought to destroy Hamas forces the military says have been regrouping around the towns of Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun. Human Rights Watch said the displacement of Palestinians 'is likely planned to be permanent in the buffer zones and security corridors', an action it said would amount to 'ethnic cleansing'.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkqumtqfye	2024-11-14T09:35:39-08:00	
Dutch police arrest 281 at anti-Israel riot in Amsterdam	Pro-Palestinian protesters violate ban on demonstrating; videos circulated online depict police violence, including beating protesters with batons after release from detention Dutch authorities on Thursday said they were investigating reports of police violence against pro-Palestinian protesters after a banned rally on Wednesday evening had been broken up. The Amsterdam police said on X that they were aware of online footage, which seemed to show police officers beating protesters who had already been released after being taken away from the site of the protest. A total of 281 protesters were detained as they participated in an anti-Israel demonstration in central Amsterdam on Wednesday in defiance of a ban imposed after violence stemming from a soccer match between Ajax and Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv last week. 'Images of police acting with force are always disturbing to see and will be weighed and judged. Also in this case,' Amsterdam police said in a post on X. Police with expanded stop-and-search powers in the Dutch capital have detained or removed hundreds of demonstrators since last week's clashes, under emergency measures imposed until Thursday. Four out of 62 suspects detained during the violence, which included 10 Israelis, remain in custody. Police are still looking for suspects. Due to the violence against the Israelis, the Amsterdam police announced a ban on demonstrations, but in recent days pro-Palestinian demonstrators have violated the ban several times. Masked rioters in Amsterdam threw fireworks at a tram in the west of the city Monday evening while shouting 'Jews are cancer.' The tram car, which was empty, caught fire and its windows were blown out. In addition, damage was caused to nearby vehicles. In the city square, where rioters threw fireworks and waved sticks, clashes broke out between dozens of young people - who were dressed in black and wore masks - and police forces. A few rioters were arrested; there were no casualties.

IDF officer killed, another seriously wounded in southern Lebanon...	Lieutenant Ivri Dickshtein, 21, a platoon commander in the Golani Brigade’s 51st Battalion from the settlement of Eli, killed in combat, just a day after six other soldiers from the same battalion fell in battle in southern Lebanon The IDF reported that Lieutenant Ivri Dickshtein, 21, a platoon commander in the Golani Brigade’s 51st Battalion, from the settlement of Eli, was killed in combat in southern Lebanon on Thursday.

IDF: Rocket fire from Lebanon drops as pressure mounts on Hezboll...	The IDF reported on Thursday that daily rocket fire from Lebanon has decreased to fewer than 100 rockets, down from over 150, following intensified barrages targeting Israel’s north and central regions in recent days. The IDF attributes this drop to increased military pressure on Hezbollah’s launch capabilities, including strikes on rocket launch sites and firepower infrastructure. The IDF also said that over 2,250 Hezbollah operatives have been killed since the onset of Israel’s ground operations, including numerous senior commanders, which has reportedly hindered Hezbollah’s ability to sustain retaliatory actions. 'We are reinforcing this success, targeting additional launchers each day aimed at strikes on northern Israel,' the IDF said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjt2ss7zyx	2024-11-14T07:32:02-08:00	
UN to bolster UNIFIL mission for post-truce support in Lebanon	The United Nations intends to bolster its peacekeeping mission in Lebanon to better support the Lebanese army once a truce is agreed but would not directly enforce a cease-fire, U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix said on Thursday. The peacekeeping mission known as UNIFIL is deployed in southern Lebanon to monitor the demarcation line with Israel, an area that has seen more than a year of hostilities between Israeli troops and Iran-backed Hezbollah terrorists. Israel has for years accused UNIFIL of failing to implement U.N. resolution 1701, which ended the Second Lebanon war in 2006 and requires Hezbollah to remove fighters and weapons from areas between the border and the Litani River, and now says peacekeepers must get out of the way as Israeli troops fight Hezbollah. UNIFIL troops have refused to leave their posts, despite repeated Israeli attacks that have wounded peacekeepers.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk00dmjqzyx	2024-11-14T07:22:49-08:00

With full congressional backing secured, Trump plans Pentagon 'pu...	After Republicans take control of both houses of Congress, plans to 'clean house' at Pentagon and bring in more like-minded people to Trump's new administration already in motion Republicans clinched a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, completing a sweep of both chambers of Congress and solidifying GOP power alongside President-elect Donald Trump. Following the final vote count, which gave Republicans at least 218 of the 435 House seats, the party also secured a Senate majority, positioning Trump to govern decisively. With Trump set for inauguration on January 20, his transition team is actively assembling his administration, including key nominations like the new ambassador to Israel. Notably, the transition team is reportedly preparing a plan to overhaul military leadership, potentially targeting officers perceived as having resisted Trump’s policies in the past. According to Reuters, the team is compiling a list of senior officers, including some members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for possible removal. This includes officers seen as aligned with former Chairman Mark Milley, whom Trump allies have criticized over perceived 'disloyalty' following Milley’s recent comments against Trump. The transition team’s list reportedly targets 'woke' officers, referencing Trump’s criticism of leaders he claimed were promoted based on diversity initiatives rather than combat-readiness. While some insiders express doubts over the feasibility of these changes, pointing to the risks posed amid current global conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, others close to Trump insist such moves are necessary to reshape the military's leadership. The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that Trump’s team is even preparing an executive order to establish a committee that would identify high-ranking officials for demotion. If enacted, this would mark an unprecedented reshaping of the military leadership under the president's role as commander-in-chief. Meanwhile, Trump has named Pete Hegseth, a Fox News commentator and former Army officer, as his choice for secretary of fefense. Hegseth, known for his calls to 'clean house' at the Pentagon, has argued in recent writings that reshaping the senior ranks is crucial to ensuring U.S. defense readiness.

The defenses would likely mimic Israel's Iron Dome and other systems that intercept short- and long-range missiles launched during strikes from its neighbors amid the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon.

Iranian-backed militias in Iraq launch daily drone attacks on Isr...	Although Iraq is aware that militia activity from its territory poses a threat, fearing an Israeli retaliatory strike, pro-Iranian militia Islamic Resistance in Iraq continues to launch drone attacks and, reportedly, joint operations with Yemen's Houthis In recent weeks, the 'Islamic Resistance in Iraq' has launched nightly attacks on Israel. According to Arab reports, this organization comprises six pro-Iranian militias, including Iraq's Hezbollah Brigades, al-Nujaba, and Sayyid al-Shuhada. Operating out of Iraq and Syria, these militias target both Israel and international coalition bases led by the United States. On Wednesday, the 'Islamic Resistance in Iraq' claimed to have launched drones toward targets in northern Israel.' The group reported two strikes, following four drone attacks it had claimed the previous day, targeting what it called 'vital locations' in Eilat, central Israel, and two areas in the north. Some announcements included videos of the launches. On Tuesday, the group claimed responsibility for three attacks, and a day earlier, for six. This surge in attacks reflects an uptick in the group’s weekly drone launches at Israel. Reports of Israeli interceptions of drones over Syrian airspace en route to Israel are believed to involve these militias' drones. Occasionally, drones from the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen also attempt to reach Israel from the east, but the bulk of attacks come from the pro-Iranian militias. The Houthis have even reported joint operations with the militias during the ongoing war. On Wednesday, Sky News Arabia cited Iranian sources saying that Tehran had postponed the operation of a planned third attack on Israel. According to these sources, Iran’s response has been delayed until potential upcoming talks with former President Donald Trump, following a warning message delivered through Iraq. Meanwhile, Tehran continues to threaten. Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Commander Hossein Salami, speaking at the opening of a military drill honoring former Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, issued a warning to Israel. 'We are watching you closely,' Salami said. 'We will fight to the end and will not allow you to control the fate of Muslims. We will take revenge on the Zionist entity; it will suffer painful blows.' IRGC Deputy Commander Ali Fadavi added, 'We have not agreed, and will never agree, to any aggression against us. We will respond to Israel with force.' Though not in the form of heavy missile barrages or large drone swarms, Iran's attacks on Israel continue each night through its proxies in Syria and Iraq. A question that has preoccupied Israeli officials recently – whether Iran would strike directly or via Iraq – is becoming less relevant as drones are now launched almost daily from the region toward Israel. Iraq is aware that militia activity from its territory poses a threat to itself, fearing an Israeli retaliatory strike. Iraqi leaders also understand that, geographically, Iraq's airspace is a likely flashpoint in any Iran-Israel war. Iraq’s National Security Advisor Qasim al-Araji visited Tehran earlier this week, meeting with senior officials, including Quds Force Commander Esmail Qaani, who recently resumed public appearances. According to a Monday report from Sky News Arabia, al-Araji conveyed a U.S. message to Iran, warning that any response against Israel could lead the region into an open conflict with severe repercussions. On Tuesday, Qatar’s Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported that al-Araji had told Tehran that Iraq is committed to staying out of Iran’s wars with Israel and the U.S. Al-Araji reportedly asked Tehran to respect agreements between Washington and Baghdad and refrain from targeting U.S. forces in Iraq. He also requested that Iran pressure its allied militias to keep Iraq out of the war. However, these talks did not prevent recent launches toward Israel or attacks on U.S. bases in Syria. Iran has maintained that these militias act independently, motivated by a commitment to support Gaza. This week, the Qatari newspaper explained why pro-Iranian militias have shifted to nighttime operations. Citing Iraqi security sources, the report noted a recent increase in U.S. drone activity over the Iraq-Syria border, monitoring for weapons or fighters moving from Baghdad to Damascus. A senior official described this as a 'U.S. prohibition on all activities supporting Hezbollah or targeting Israeli assets.' American drones aim to identify launch sites used by the militias to strike Israeli bases, while nighttime operations help the groups evade detection.

Israel strikes Damascus during Iranian official's visit	Opposition site says IDF targeted an apartment in the Al Masseh quarter of the capital killing at least three people and wounding at least nine others; official Syrian news agency says two building hit in strike Israel attacked a suburb of Damascus on Thursday, the official news agency Sanaa reported, saying the attack was on the Al Mazzeh quarter in the west of the capital adding that there were casualties in the strike on two buildings. The strike took place during a visit of a senior advisor to Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei who is, according to Lebanese media reports, visiting the area on 'a special mission.' According to the Syrian opposition outlet Voice of the Capital, the attack targeted an apartment in the area and ambulances were seen rushing to the scene. The UK based Observatory for Human Rights, another Syrian opposition group, said that at least three people were killed and at least nine were hurt in the attack. News of the attack came shortly after Israel struck Hezbollah targets near Beirut's international airport, while a plane was on the runway preparing for takeoff. Israel said it attacked more than 30 terror targets in Beirut in the past two days including weapons stores and production sites the military said were near or beneath civilian structures and population. 'These strikes were a part of the IDF's ongoing efforts to dismantle and degrade Hezbollah's military capabilities, and the IDF is continuing to strike Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure sites in the Dahieh area,' the military said in a statement.

key principles for ceasefire set by Hezbollah, Beirut leaders, re...	Mikati government presents terms including complete Israeli withdrawal, ban on IDF activity in Lebanese territory on the ground, in the air and in sea; rejects any change to 1701 Lebanese officials, including Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Najib Mikati, and Hezbollah’s leadership, have established a framework outlining five key principles for ceasefire negotiations, according to a report in the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Akhbar newspaper on Thursday. Hezbollah. First and foremost, Lebanon prioritizes its own interests over those of Israel and will not negotiate with the United States as long as it speaks on Israel's behalf, Al Akhabar wrote. According to the report, Lebanon demands a complete and immediate ceasefire, rejecting any notion of temporary pauses or intermittent ceasefires. It insists on a comprehensive cessation of all military actions and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Lebanese territory. Lebanon rejects any phased implementation agreement; instead, it calls for the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 without any modifications to its enforcement mechanism, along with guarantees that Israel will cease all violations. Lebanon also dismisses any effort to link the return of displaced individuals to their villages with any other arrangements. The displaced will return just hours after a ceasefire is achieved and once Israel has completed its withdrawal. Lebanon maintains that no external entity has authority over its reconstruction efforts. Finally, the paper wrote, Lebanon will not tolerate Israeli aircraft entering its airspace or Israeli boats entering its territorial waters, and it refuses to grant any security or military oversight to the U.S. or Israel. A temporary committee, including representatives from relevant UN forces, would be the sole body authorized to oversee each party’s adherence to Resolution 1701. The Lebanese position as reported by Al Akhbar come as Israeli and American officials have indicated progress in the talks to achieve an end to the fighting in Lebanon and an agreement that would remove Hezbollah for South Lebanon. Israel was seeking American assurances in a 'side document' that would specify Israel's freedom of operation if Lebanon violates any agreements. 'This is Israel's top priority,' an official said. 'We have clear understandings with the Americans. In the event of weapons transfers from Syria, Hezbollah rearmament, or attempted attacks, we will have support to act.' The emerging arrangement is expected to include Hezbollah's withdrawal north of the Litani River, deployment of the Lebanese Army and an international peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, and the prevention of weapons transfers from Syria.

Iran tells IAEA chief it will negotiate, but not under pressure	Iran's nuclear chief warns that Tehran would react immediately to any resolution against it at an IAEA meeting next week, without elaborating Iran is willing to end an impasse over a range of issues with the U.N. nuclear agency on its atomic program but it will not succumb to pressure, its foreign minister said after meeting the watchdog's chief in Tehran on Thursday. Diplomats told Reuters on Wednesday that European powers (E3) are pushing for a new resolution against Iran by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board next week to pressure Tehran over what they view as its poor cooperation. The talks took place with Donald Trump due to take office again as U.S. President in January. During his previous tenure, the United States pulled out of the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and six world powers aimed at curbing Tehran's sensitive nuclear work. It is unclear whether Trump will continue his 'maximum pressure' policy on Iran when he takes office. Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi posted on X: 'The ball is in the EU/E3 court. Willing to negotiate based on our national interest and inalienable rights, but not ready to negotiate under pressure and intimidation,' following his talks with the IAEA chief. Iranian state media also quoted him as saying: 'I hope the other side will adopt a rational policy.' Relations between Tehran and the IAEA have soured over several long-standing issues including Iran barring the agency's uranium-enrichment experts from the country and its failure to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites. In August, the agency said Iran's production of highly enriched uranium continues and it has not improved cooperation with it despite a resolution passed by the IAEA Board of Governors in June. Grossi, who has long sought progress with Tehran over its fast-advancing nuclear work, said: 'Inspections are just one chapter of our cooperation and cannot be discussed.' The U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear pact in 2018 and the reimposition of sanctions prompted Tehran to violate limitations on its uranium enrichment - seen by the West as a disguised effort to develop nuclear weapons capability. Tehran is now enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to the roughly 90% required for an atom bomb. Tehran says its nuclear work is purely for peaceful purposes. Iran's nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami said his meeting with Grossi was 'constructive' but he warned that Tehran would react immediately to any resolution against it at an IAEA meeting next week, without elaborating. A senior Iranian official told Reuters on Wednesday that Tehran's reaction to a resolution could be to limit diplomatic and technical cooperation with the IAEA. Grossi, in a televised joint press conference with Eslami, urged Tehran to take steps to resolve the remaining issues. 'It is in our power here to take concrete steps that will indicate clearly, to the U.S. and the international community, that we can clarify things and move forward with concrete solutions,' Grossi said. Grossi, who arrived in Tehran on Wednesday, is expected to meet Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian for the first time since he took office in August. On Tuesday, Pezeshkian, seen as relatively moderate, said Tehran will not be able to ignore its arch-foe the United States and needs to 'handle its enemies with forbearance'.

Netanyahu chief of staff probed in security related scandal	Tzachi Braverman, the prime minister's closest aid is summoned by the police serious crimes unit for questioning under caution over matters involving possible misconduct at the PMO Tzachi Braverman, Chief of Staff to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was summoned to the police special crimes unit on Thursday for questioning under caution. He is suspected of involvement in security-related cases tied to the Prime Minister's Office. The police was investigating whether he held embarrassing information about a senior IDF officer for the purpose of using it prevent disclosure of misconduct in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO.) Braverman also faces suspicion in the 'Protocols Affair,' which according to allegations, involved efforts to alter minutes from official and confidential meeting at the start of the war regarding the Hamas massacre. Braverman, 65 is a powerful figure in the PMO and among the closest aids to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'He is cold-blooded to a psychotic degree,' an unnamed government minister said last week. 'He has a cowardly nature. He’s cautious not to get entangled and act against procedures, but he can always pin it on someone else.' Netanyahu in an unprecedented statement, criticized the police and the Shin Bet earlier in the week for what he called an attempt to bring down a right-wing government. 'In recent days, my office has been under wild and unrestrained attack,' Netanyahu said on camera after repeated denials from his office of any wrong-doings in any of the matters under investigation. 'While the government and cabinet under my leadership tirelessly work to repel our enemies who seek our destruction and strive to defeat them, as I manage the war and fend off international attacks from various arenas, we now face another front with increased intensity—the fake news from the media.' Netanyahu said that since the beginning of the war, a flood of criminal and severe leaks has inundated Israel, referring to reports in the press about his management of the hostage crisis and his refusal to agree to a deal with Hamas that would secure their release. 'These criminal leaks are sometimes accompanied by baseless lies and slanders. A deluge of leaks from the political-security cabinet, the war cabinet at the time, and a continuous tsunami of leaks from the negotiation team. These leaks provide vital information to Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas, endangering the state, our fighters, and the return of our captives,' he said. 'Hamas receives information from inside Israel's negotiation team meeting room. Hezbollah and Iran sometimes get live transcripts of our discussions on actions against them and our internal debates.' He said claiming there has been selective enforcement of security offenses by law enforcement and judicial authorities. 'Regarding all these, zero investigations were conducted. Zero. This happened despite my repeated requests to open investigations. They don’t even check, why? Because the goal is not to protect the state's security. The goal is to promote an agenda of weakness and concessions during the war.'

Eritrea pays to free its supporters from Israel's jails after rio...	After 135 people hurt in violence between waring Eritrean groups Israel late to take steps to deport those responsible The government in Eritrea posted NIS 84,000 in bail to release its supporters from prison after they were involved in violent riots, vandalism and theft, according to a document obtained by Ynet on Thursday. The violence erupted earlier this year when asylum-seekers who were opponents of the regime and its supporters clashed on the streets of Tel Aviv. More than nine people were killed and over 100 hurt in mass riots in August and September. Then Tel Aviv police chief Peretz Amar said his force cannot single-handedly respond to the violence. His statement came after two people were brutally murdered. In a rare, accusatory speech, Amar blamed the government for failing to address the problem by deporting the instigators. Eritrea is considered by some in the West as an oppressive and brutal regime, posing a genuine threat to the lives of its dissents. Consequently, although Eritreans in Israel are not officially recognized as refugees, they are not repatriated under a policy practiced in many countries, which aims to protect individuals from severe rights violations or life-threatening conditions in their homeland. Instead of refugee status, they receive temporary permits allowing them to remain in Israel without permanent residency rights. However, in the case of clear regime supporters, it is unclear why Israel has not deported them, especially considering their violent attacks on asylum seekers who face genuine life threats. The document was written by a judge last September after the Eritrean embassy's requested to be refunded for a bond posted for the release of a supporter of the regime. The Population and Immigration Authority refused having been surprised to learn who paid the bail. The judge ruled that the request should not be considered until the Eritrean is deported and asked why he was allowed to remains in Israel at all. He was arrested over his involvement in riots last September near the Eritrean embassy in Tel Aviv, during which he assaulted other foreigners with clubs and engaged in extensive vandalism. He and others were initially released because the investigation could not be completed and evidence could not be gathered to prove criminality. 'The Eritrean embassy should assist the detainee in returning to his country, as he was personally aided by them during his detention and was involved in violent events on the side of the regime supporters in Eritrea,' the judge wrote, 'It became clear during the hearing and discussion with him that there is actually no obstacle to his return to his country, and the reason for his stay in Israel was not clarified. After the detainee leaves Israel in accordance with the deportation order, the embassy may request a refund of the bond deposited to ensure his departure from Israel.' The document reveals that Eritrea has been posting bail for the release of violent citizens detained in Israel since 2018. This practice continued even after the unprecedented riots on September 2, 2023, which injured at least 135 people and turned South Tel Aviv into a battleground. As of December 31, 2023, there were 17,381 Eritreans in Israel, out of 23,081 asylum seekers. A trend of departure is evident, with 2,557 leaving in 2023, compared to 2,205 in 2022 and 1,340 in 2021. It's unclear why Israeli authorities accepted bail money from Eritrea, allowing rioters to remain under the guise of seeking asylum, despite their support for the Eritrean regime. The Ministry of Justice is aware of these releases and is currently discussing the possibility of deporting Eritreans who commit criminal offenses and support the regime. This discussion involves representatives from the Population and Immigration Authority, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Israeli Police, and the Ministry of National Security, though no decision has been made yet. The Justice Ministry said deportation is under the authority of the Population and Immigration Authority and that anyone in Israel committing offenses is subject to Israeli law, with no separate legal standards for foreigners. The Immigration Ministry said that foreigners violating the law risk having their permits revoked and being deported, except in cases where criminal proceedings are ongoing. However, this excludes those who cannot be returned to their home country, where only criminal proceedings are applicable. Eritreans in Israel are protected under a non-deportation policy, which is reviewed periodically. The National Security Ministry's position is to deport all infiltrators back to their countries. The ministry said it faced challenges in deporting infiltrators due to Supreme Court rulings limiting the state's ability to deport them. Despite this, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir criticized the Justice Ministry and the Attorney General for delaying deportations.

Author Amotz Asa-El: ‘Nobody can silence Hezbollah’s guns’	ILTV News Insider experts say only Iran can stop Hezbollah from firing on Israel Can a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah be reached before President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January? According to author and Middle East analyst Amotz Asa-El, the outlook is grim. 'I’m pessimistic not because of the Lebanese government’s attitude, not because of America, not because of Israel, but because of Hezbollah,' he told ILTV’s Insider this week. 'Nobody down there is in a position to actually make it silence its guns. We consigned with the United States whatever they and us would like to do, none of that will impact the militia over there directly.' Who can silence Hezbollah? According to Asa-El, only Iran, and 'no one knows how to make them do that.'

Can the IDF decimate Hezbollah’s weapons arsenal?	ILTV News speaks with Joe Truzman, a senior research analyst and editor at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies If the IDF aimed to eliminate all of Hezbollah’s precision-guided missiles and other weapons, the war between Israel and the terrorist organization would likely take much longer, according to Joe Truzman, a senior research analyst and editor at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies' Long War Journal. 'Right now, the Israeli government's goal, essentially, is a limited conflict,' he told ILTV News, 'specifically to remove Hezbollah from southern Lebanon up to the Litani River, so the Israeli civilians that have been displaced during the war can return home.'

‘Mike Huckabee wants to be settler himself’	ILTV News speaks with Rabbi Tuly Weisz of Israel365 By nominating former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as U.S. Ambassador to Israel, President-elect Donald Trump is effectively signaling he does not consider a two-state solution to be viable for resolving the Middle East conflict, according to Rabbi Tuly Weisz, founder of Israel365. 'Mike Huckabee is the biggest proponent of Judea and Samaria,' Weisz told ILTV on Wednesday. 'He doesn't even call it the West Bank. He only refers to it by its historical and biblical name: Yehuda and Shomron, Judea and Samaria. The Biden administration is sanctioning settlers, and Mike Huckabee wants to buy a house in Efrat and become a settler himself.' Weisz argued that with many of Trump’s new appointments, Israel could see vast changes in U.S. policy 'from night to day, from bad to good.' 'We’re going to see great things, especially when it comes to handling the war,' said Weisz. 'Israel has been fighting with its hands tied behind its back,' with the U.S. 'holding back weapons, leading to the deaths of IDF soldiers.' He said Trump, on the other hand, would support Israel in finishing the war victoriously, including the release of hostages. Huckabee, however, is the first evangelical Christian, as opposed to Jewish, appointment as ambassador to Israel in some time. Weisz believes this will benefit Israel, as Jewish ambassadors to Israel are 'very nervous about allegations of dual loyalty.' In contrast, he said, 'Christians don't have that problem. They have one loyalty. They have loyalty to God, and the Word of God, and the Word of God is really crystal clear that America needs to support Israel.'

Israel plans Lebanon cease-fire as gift for Trump	Minister Ron Dermer holds talks in D.C. aiming for agreement in time Trump for Trump's second term; Key points include Hezbollah’s withdrawal, Lebanese army deployment and Russia's pressure on al-Assad to prevent Syrian arms smuggling Israel is maneuvering toward a ceasefire agreement with Lebanon, an initiative poised to gift the incoming President Donald Trump with a diplomatic triumph as he takes office. According to reports in the Washington Post on Thursday. Prime Minister Netanyahu had already set the stage for this 'new era' with Washington well before the American presidential elections, maintaining contact with Trump while Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer discussed the matter with Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, an architect of the Abraham Accords. A former Trump administration official told the paper that Kushner may assume an advisory role should normalization talks between Israel and Saudi Arabia advance, even if he holds no official position in the White House. Dermer's talks at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Florida estate, reportedly focused on a ceasefire agreement in Lebanon involving Russian participation. Russian representatives visited Israel last month to deliberate on the plan, and Dermer followed up with a visit to Russia. From Hezbollah's perspective, a source close to the terror group indicated potential agreement to withdraw its forces north of the Litani River as part of a provisional ceasefire. According to Israeli sources, the Lebanese army would control the border area during the first 60 days of the agreement, supervised by the U.S. and the U.K. However, Hezbollah resists Israel's stipulation, intended to be a 'side document' to the agreement, asserting a clear condition: Israel must refrain from operations within Lebanese territory. An Israeli official said that negotiations with the U.S. were nearing agreement. Central to these talks was a 'side document,' deemed critical, to be provided by the U.S., that would specify Israel's operational freedom in response to any Lebanese violations. Israel and the U.S. have reached explicit understandings, granting Israel the backing to act in the event of weapons transfers from Syria, Hezbollah rearmament, or attempted attacks. The importance of U.S. agreement is underscored by existing tensions between the nations, with legitimacy and the ability to act being paramount for Israel. The core elements of the emerging arrangement include Hezbollah's withdrawal north of the Litani River, Lebanese army deployment in southern Lebanon, and preventing weapon transfers from Syria. Concurrently, Israeli representatives, including Dermer, have visited Moscow to enlist Russian pressure on Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime. Israel is already targeting military sites within Syria, reflecting an assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin has vested interests in safeguarding Assad's regime from potential destabilization due to continued arms transfers. Despite these efforts, significant doubts linger regarding Lebanon's willingness to accept the arrangement. As one Israeli official noted, understandings with the Americans can be achieved, but ultimately, the Lebanese may reject them. Should this occur, Israel is prepared with alternative operational plans, vowing not to tolerate a prolonged state of attrition warfare and pledging intensified action in Lebanon until an agreement is reached. An agreement could be reached in the coming weeks. If successful, it would be presented for approval by Israel's political-security cabinet, though it remains undecided whether Knesset approval wouldalso be necessary. Amos Hochstein, the U.S. special envoy to Lebanon, expressed optimism about a deal being reached but said that there was no Russian involvement from the American perspective, in the discussions between Israel and Moscow. Russia was reportedly willing to provide guarantees to prevent arms smuggling from Syria to Lebanon, but demands that the U.S. remove Russian companies from U.S. blacklists and sanctions.

How did the Jewish Federation keep thousands of Jews safe in D.C....	Jewish Federations of North America General Assembly takes place amid protests and antisemitic threats The Jewish Federations of North America General Assembly brought together 2,500 people at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in the heart of Washington, D.C. This event, one of the largest gatherings of Jewish people in America, took place amid rising antisemitism and violent Palestinian protests that have plagued the country since the onset of the Gaza and Lebanon conflicts. Shira Hutt, Executive Vice President of JFNA, told ILTV News that security is a top priority for the federation, with protocols in place from day one. 'It’s something that we always take very seriously,' Hutt told ILTV News. 'It is something that all of our 146 federations take very seriously, and we work with them to ensure that whenever they gather... everyone can be safe at those events, with no limitations on the community's ability to gather, flourish, and celebrate being Jewish.' Hutt shared that JFNA coordinated with security vendors, hotel staff, and local police. Additional security layers included Israeli and American secret service agents to protect President Isaac Herzog and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, both of whom spoke at the event. Attendees had to pass through metal detectors to enter the hotel, where dozens of police officers and hired security guards were stationed on every floor, along with security dogs. These measures were integrated into the conference in a way that kept people safe without disrupting the experience. Since 2018, following the tragic antisemitic attack at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue, the Jewish community has seen a $750 million investment in physical security through the LiveSecure initiative and the Nonprofit Security Grant Program. 'I think everyone that came into the conference felt good about the steps we took to ensure their safety,' Hutt added. William Daroff, CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, also put the situation into perspective. He said, 'In other times, there was government working against us, law enforcement working against us in the times of the shtetls and the tsars.' He noted that 'now, government is here being helpful—helping to protect us and safeguard us—and that is something different in the current fight we are in compared to previous fights.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjsspcmfyg	2024-11-13T22:53:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/11/14/Hk54h7Xzyg/Hk54h7Xzyg_11_259_445_251_0_small.jpg

Dutch police detain protesters supporting Palestine in war	Protesters defy ban on demonstrations after violent attacks against Israelis last week; The Netherlands has seen a rise in antisemitic incidents since the Gaza war began Police detained pro-Palestinian protesters rallying in central Amsterdam on Wednesday in defiance of a ban imposed after violence stemming from a football match between Ajax and Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv. Dozens of demonstrators, some with Palestinian flags, chanted 'Amsterdam is saying no to genocide' and 'Free Palestine'. Police in riot gear encircled the group and they were detained and put on buses. Police with expanded stop-and-search powers in the Dutch capital have detained or removed hundreds of demonstrators since last week's clashes under emergency measures imposed until Thursday. 'We say: Free Palestine. Stop killing innocent people. Stop killing the children,' said demonstrator Max van den Berg, 32, calling on the Netherlands to halt its support for Israel. Israel denies genocide in Gaza. It says that forces combating Palestinian Hamas terrorists that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, do not target civilians. Amsterdam's police department said Maccabi fans attacked a taxi and burned a Palestinian flag and were chased down and beaten by anti-Israeli gangs on scooters after an online appeal to taxi drivers. Five people were treated for injuries and released from hospitals. Police escorted hundreds of Maccabi fans to their hotels. Israeli and Dutch politicians have denounced the attacks as antisemitic and recalled persecution of Jews during World War Two. Pro-Palestinians countered that they responded to an attack by the Maccabi supporters and provocative anti-Arab chants. Four out of 62 suspects detained during the violence, which included 10 Israelis, remain in custody. Police are still looking for suspects. The Netherlands has seen a rise in antisemitic incidents since the Gaza war began in October last year. Less than 1% of Amsterdam's population is Jewish following the Holocaust, while around 15% is Muslim, mostly second and first-generation immigrants from North Africa and the Middle East. Additional arrests were made during rioting on Monday night in the predominantly immigrant neighborhood of West Amsterdam where Moroccan-Dutch youths sympathise with Palestinians in Gaza Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryqflzmfjg	2024-11-13T19:59:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/11/13/HkxNb1cfMyx/HkxNb1cfMyx_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Big dreams, bigger hearts: The stories of the six Golani soldiers...	Itay was a dedicated leader, Sraya was joyful and generous, Dror was a loyal protector, Nir was hardworking and kind, Shalev was a true-hearted fighter and Yoav a spirited champion; they put everything on the line to protect their home Since the outbreak of the war, 793 IDF soldiers have fallen in battle, six of them on Wednesday alone. They were identified as Captain Itay Marcovich, 22, from Kokhav Ya'ir; Staff Sergeant Sraya Elbom, 21, from Mehola; Staff Sergeant Dror Hen, 20, from Gan Haim; Staff Sergeant Nir Gofer, 20, from Dimona; Sergeant Shalev Itzhak Sagron, 21, from Sderot; and Sergeant Yoav Daniel, 19, from Nahariya, all from the Golani Brigade's 51st Battalion. There are their stories. 'Truly a remarkable person' Sergeant Shalev Itzhak Sagron, 21, from Sderot, served as a combat soldier in the 51st Battalion of the Golani Brigade. In a few months, he was due to begin a squad commanders' course. His sister, Renana, told Ynet that he 'was truly a remarkable person, with immense values and incredible strength.' She added, 'Anyone who knew him can attest to how pure-hearted he was.' The family moved to Sderot near the Gaza border in 2022, having previously lived in Moshav Nehalim in central Israel. 'During most rounds of fighting, we were evacuated,' she said. 'Shalev studied at the Nehalim yeshiva, where we also lived. He was passionate about Golani, dedicated to his service. He loved the army deeply—it was his dream to be a combat soldier.' 'About six months ago, his commander practically insisted he go to the course, but Shalev wanted to remain a soldier,' she continued. 'He always said, 'I want to be a combat soldier—nothing else.' He saw himself as a protector of Israel with his own body. He came home just before Simchat Torah, after a long time away, mostly in Lebanon. His arrival was filled with joy, and we shared special moments together. Looking back, I realize those were our last moments together—a sweet memory that will stay with us.' 'Our hearts can hardly bear the pain' Captain Itay Marcovich, 22, from Kokhav Ya'ir, served as a platoon commander in the Golani Brigade’s 51st Battalion. He is survived by his parents, Tami and Oren, and two siblings, Omri and Ella. His brother was injured in a Hezbollah drone attack on the Golani Brigade training base last month. Itay’s former teacher, Noa Shimoni, shared her memories: 'Another name added to the list of the fallen, another face I remember—the look in his eyes when the material interested him or when he suddenly understood the explanation, the laughter in class, the smile, the desire to understand why I gave the grade I did.' 'Itay Marcovich, of blessed memory. It’s surreal to write those words after your name. I will never forget you,' she added. The Kokhav Ya'ir-Tzur Yigal local council also paid tribute, saying, 'Our hearts can hardly bear the pain. The community mourns and embraces the beloved Marcovich family on the loss of their son Itay.' Itay will be laid to rest Thursday at 3:30 p.m. in the military section of the Kokhav Ya'ir cemetery. The council announced, 'The public is invited to pay final respects to Itay and to join the family with Israeli flags at 3:00 p.m., from the entrance square (near the Etgari Center) to the path leading to the cemetery.' 'He always looked after his soldiers' Staff Sergeant Dror Hen, 20, from Gan Haim, served as a squad sergeant in the 51st Battalion of the Golani Brigade. He is survived by his parents, Avital and Yisrael, and two brothers, Aviv and Ra'anan. Dror’s uncle, Zohar Hen, remembered him with deep emotion, saying, 'Our patriotic family cannot comprehend this. Dror served in Lebanon, just as I did in the reserves. He would joke about my helmet as a reservist compared to his tactical gear.' The uncle added that Dror 'never complained' and 'always looked after his soldiers in the Golani Brigade, where he was proud to serve.' 'He was a brilliant student,' his uncle shared. 'He could have gone to the Air Force or Unit 8200, but he made it clear to everyone in the family: only combat, only Golani.' The uncle said Dror felt immense joy in his service, sharing that on his last weekend home he had mentioned 'work still to be done.' Dror, who had a close bond with his two brothers, had also planned to pursue higher education after his service. 'He was incredibly talented—it’s a loss beyond words,' his uncle expressed. Ora Omer Katz, Dror’s mother’s cousin, paid tribute, writing, 'Dror, a Golani fighter, a charming young man and pride of the family. Our hearts are crushed with pain, struggling to believe this unbearable loss.' The Southern Sharon Regional Council announced that the funeral is set for Thursday at 2:00 p.m. at the Gan Haim cemetery and invited residents to 'bring flags along the main street of Gan Haim to accompany our beloved Dror on his final journey.' 'A hardworking young man' Staff Sergeant Nir Gofer, 20, from Dimona, served as a combat soldier in the 51st Battalion of the Golani Brigade. He is survived by his parents, Geula and Noam, and his siblings Uriah, Ran, Gil, Dikla and Idan. Dimona Mayor Benny Biton mourned his passing, writing, 'Nir was a hardworking young man, a computer whiz who chose combat service out of a desire to give back to his country. All of Dimona grieves his loss.' 'A joyful young man with deep values and boundless generosity' Staff Sergeant Sraya Elbom, 21, from Mehola, was a squad commander in the 51st Battalion of the Golani Brigade. He leaves behind his parents, Yael and Shai, and siblings Netanel, Hodaya, Eyal and Aviram. The Jordan Valley Regional Council paid tribute, saying, 'Sraya was a sociable, joyful young man, surrounded by friends, with deep values and boundless generosity. He left for combat in Gaza during his commanders’ course, returned to complete the course, and went straight into combat in Lebanon. He had only four months left until his discharge.' Yisrael, a close friend, also mourned him, writing, 'The sweetest, most beautiful kid, the one I loved and admired, the kid who was better and more dedicated than all of us—he fell in Lebanon.' He added, 'Sraya, how did you let God win? It makes no sense. Where did you go? I need you to come back for one last cigarette with me.' 'A true fighter' Sergeant Yoav Daniel, 19, from Nahariya, served as a soldier in the 51st Battalion of the Golani Brigade. He is survived by his parents, Revital and Shachar, and his sisters, Hadar and Stav. The Municipality of Nahariya expressed condolences, saying, 'We extend our embrace to the family during this difficult time. May they know no more sorrow. May his memory be a blessing.' Sparta Martial Arts Club in Haifa, where Yoav trained, also paid tribute, saying, 'With deep sadness and heartbreak, we say goodbye to a true fighter, friend and brother to many of us—Yoav Daniel, a unique spirit. He trained with us for two years, and from the start, his ever-present smile broke down all barriers. Being around Yoav meant constant laughter and lightheartedness, no matter the situation.' 'He quickly became part of the Sparta family,' they added. 'Yoav was an Israeli MMA champion for several years and even competed abroad, but he decided that serving as a combat soldier was his priority. Less than a year ago, we threw him a send-off party with one of his favorite things—food. I was incredibly proud of his decision to enlist in combat, and we had many talks about the importance of serving as a soldier, especially in times like these.' 'Sadly, Yoav belonged to a generation that joined the IDF during wartime, and that’s all he knew in his military service,' the club shared. 'Whenever he had leave, he would come to our open mats in Haifa and train with friends. We saw him just a few days ago, and everyone’s hearts are broken. Wherever he is now, I’m sure he’s smiling.'

Katz declares disarming Hezbollah as one of war goals	Defense minister says Israel will not agree to any arrangement that does not include disarming Hezbollah, pushing terror group beyond Litani River and creating conditions for safe return of northern residents to their homes Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Wednesday that disarming Hezbollah was one of Israel's goals in its war against the Lebanese terrorist group despite the Security Cabinet not approving such an objective. Speaking at a situation assessment in Northern Command, Katz added that the IDF 'Expanded ground operations in southern Lebanon and are targeting Hezbollah assets in Beirut’s Dahieh district and wherever else necessary.' 'While we’re here, terror infrastructures are collapsing in Beirut. We will not observe any cease-fires, ease up on the pressure or allow any resolution that doesn’t meet our war objectives—disarming Hezbollah, pushing them beyond the Litani River and creating conditions for northern residents to return home safely.' As far as is known, the only additional war objective for the north approved by the Security Cabinet as of September is the safe return of northern residents to their homes. Katz’s remarks come amid ongoing negotiations with the United States, with final terms being drafted regarding the northern border. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer is leading these discussions with Washington. Even the disarmament of Hezbollah up to the Litani River—which Israel demands as a condition for its withdrawal from Lebanese territory—was not part of the limited operation targeting villages near the border. South of the Litani, dozens of Shiite villages will remain with weapons that the IDF will not engage with on the ground, as it only focused on the villages directly along the border.

Five of them were identified as Captain Itay Marcovich, 22, from Kokhav Ya'ir; Staff Sergeant Sraya Elbom, 21, from Mehola; Staff Sergeant Dror Hen, 20, from Gan Haim; Staff Sergeant Nir Gofer, 20, from Dimona; and Sergeant Shalev Itzhak Sagron, 21, from Sderot, all from the Golani Brigade's 51st Battalion. A sixth soldier has yet to be named. The unit entered the sector the previous night as part of the 36th Division's operation to conduct sweeps near the Lebanese border. An initial military probe indicates that at approximately 10 a.m., a detachment of Golani troops entered a building where terrorists had been lying in wait and opened fire at close range. The IDF suspects the terrorists emerged from a concealed underground tunnel, avoiding prior Israeli airstrikes on the area. A fierce, close-quarters battle ensued, resulting in the elimination of at least one Hezbollah fighter, with clashes continuing for several hours until control was secured. This operation followed a period of brief respite for many Israeli brigades operating in southern Lebanon, as reserve forces were partially withdrawn. However, with the government extending the war amid stalled political negotiations, Northern Command prepared additional operations. Ynet military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai noted that, as in past phases of combat, Israeli forces faced heavy resistance upon penetrating deeply entrenched enemy defenses. He added that Hezbollah, having observed Israeli tactics and learned from public statements, fortified the area and positioned ambush teams in the village structures. The intense confrontation resulted in the loss of Israeli soldiers, though it led to a significant reduction in short-range rocket launches by Hezbollah as IDF forces advanced. President Isaac Herzog paid tribute to the fallen soldiers, saying, 'Along with the entire people of Israel, I received with deep sorrow and pain the news of the loss of six Golani fighters, heroes of Israel, who fell defending our homeland in combat with Hezbollah.' He added, 'They fight for us with courage, bravery and self-sacrifice for the protection of our people and land. Each one of them is a world unto himself, and behind every name is a family whose world has been shattered. I embrace the grieving families, alongside all families who have lost loved ones in this fierce battle and pray for the swift recovery of all those injured in body and soul.'

Watch: IDF shares footage of Navy and ground forces working together in Lebanon operations, where submarines and missile boats target terrorists; strikes eliminate senior Hamas and Hezbollah operatives and hit strategic facilities The IDF on Wednesday evening released footage of Navy operations amid ongoing fighting in Lebanon, showcasing defensive and offensive missions at sea, where submarines and missile boats joined ground forces to eliminate terrorists. In one video, Navy forces, with intelligence assistance from Shin Bet and Naval Intelligence, killed Said Alaa Naif Ali, a senior operative in Hamas' military wing in Lebanon. who was responsible for planning attacks against Israeli targets and recruiting operatives for Hamas in Lebanon. In a separate strike led by Air Force intelligence, the IDF confirmed it had killed Ali Barakat, a central figure in Hezbollah's Unit 127, specializing in aerial operations. The operations were coordinated through the Navy's fire control center in close collaboration with the Northern Command, the Air Force and Military Intelligence. In another operation led by Naval Intelligence, Israeli fighter jets targeted Hezbollah’s main naval base in Beirut. The facility, serving as a key operational center, housed dozens of vessels and was used for training Hezbollah’s naval force in attacks on Israeli maritime and strategic targets. Meanwhile, a senior Israeli official told Ynet on Wednesday that talks with the United States on a political arrangement to end fighting against Hezbollah on the northern border are in their final drafting stages, with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer leading the efforts with Washington. At the center of the talks is a supplement intended to secure Israel’s operational freedom in case of violations by Lebanon. 'This is the most important thing for Israel,' the official stressed. 'We have clear understandings with the Americans,' he added. 'In cases of weapons smuggling from Syria, Hezbollah's rearmament or attempts at attacks — we’ll have backing to act.' He noted that the agreement with Washington is especially significant amid the ongoing tensions between the countries. 'The arrangement and legitimacy to act are very important to us.'

Israel, US zero in on final draft for Lebanon cease-fire, officia...	US-mediated talks reportedly nearing completion on agreement aimed at pushing Hezbollah back from border while ensuring Israel retains operational freedom should terms be violated Talks with the United States on a political arrangement to end fighting against Hezbollah on the northern border are in their final drafting stages, with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer leading the efforts with Washington, a senior Israeli official told Ynet on Wednesday. At the center of the talks is a supplement intended to secure Israel’s operational freedom in case of violations by Lebanon. 'This is the most important thing for Israel,' the official stressed. 'We have clear understandings with the Americans,' he added. 'In cases of weapons smuggling from Syria, Hezbollah's rearmament or attempts at attacks — we’ll have backing to act.' He noted that the agreement with Washington is especially significant amid the ongoing tensions between the countries. 'The arrangement and legitimacy to act are very important to us.' The main terms of the emerging arrangement include Hezbollah's withdrawal north of the Litani River, deployment of the Lebanese army in the country's south and prevention of weapons smuggling and deliveries from Syria. Israeli representatives, including Dermer, have visited Moscow to try to enlist Russia's influence in pressuring Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime alongside talks with the Americans. 'We’re already attacking in Syria, including military targets,' the official revealed. Israel believes Russian President Vladimir Putin has an interest in preventing harm to Assad's regime that could potentially come from the continuation of weapons transfers to Hezbollah. The officials also stressed, however, that there’s still significant doubt about Lebanon's willingness to agree to the arrangement. 'You can reach understandings with the U.S., but the Lebanese can ultimately say no,' he noted. In that case, Israel has alternative operational plans and 'won’t sit idly by nor allow this state of attrition to continue,' and it will act 'with greater intensity,' in Lebanon until an arrangement is achieved. A clearer assessment of the deal’s chances of being accepted is expected within the next two weeks. If finalized, the agreement will be presented for approval by Israel’s Security Cabinet and may also require a vote in the Knesset.

FBI arrests CIA agent in Pentagon leak scandal, report says	Suspect in classified document leak detailing Israel's preparations for attack on Iran identified as Asif William Rahman, CIA operative with top-secret clearance; Rahman arrested in Cambodia and expected to appear before judge in Guam The FBI has arrested a suspect in Cambodia linked to the leak of classified Pentagon documents detailing Israel’s preparations for its attack on Iran, The New York Times reported Wednesday afternoon. According to court documents and sources familiar with the case, the suspect, identified as Asif William Rahman, is a CIA officer who had been working outside the United States. The Times cited court filings indicating that Rahman had a security clearance granting him access to top-secret information, similar to many CIA employees handling classified material. The CIA declined to comment on the report. Rahman was reportedly detained in Cambodia on Tuesday, following the filing of charges against him last week in a federal court in Virginia. He faces two counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information. He is expected to appear in court on Thursday in Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific Ocean. The two classified documents were leaked last month during Israel’s preparations for a potential response to a barrage of ballistic missiles launched by Iran on October 1. According to at least one foreign media report, which Israel later denied, the leak caused a delay in its response, which eventually came three weeks after the missile strike in an operation called Days of Repentance. The documents, dated October 15 and 16 and marked 'Top Secret,' first surfaced on a pro-Iran Telegram channel before being shared on X (formerly Twitter). They were reportedly produced by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), which analyzes data and images gathered by U.S. spy satellites. Their security classification restricts sharing to the Five Eyes alliance, an intelligence-sharing network among the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The leaked documents detail Israeli preparations for an attack on Iran, including a 'large-scale deployment drill' by the Israeli Air Force and an aerial refueling exercise. One document states that the Air Force was working with air-launched ballistic missiles, and, since October 8, had engaged with at least 16 missiles labeled 'Golden Horizon' and at least 40 of another model known as ISO2 or Rocks. The specifics of the 'Golden Horizon' missile remain unclear, as it has not been previously disclosed by Israel or other sources. The Rocks missile, however, was unveiled by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems in 2019 and is described on the company’s website as an air-to-surface missile equipped with a lethal warhead, capable of destroying targets both above ground and in fortified underground locations.

Israel and Hezbollah prepare for a winter war	As winter intensifies, the conflict in Lebanon raises questions about weather impacts on warfare, especially with floods hitting Beirut; Experts say weather affects ground operations more than air, possibly putting pressure on negotiations – but it won't halt determined military actions As winter firmly establishes itself, the ongoing conflict on the northern border prompts questions, even among Arab states, about the implications of changing weather conditions on military operations. In Lebanon, the onset of winter was strongly felt earlier this week. On Sunday evening, videos and images circulated showing floods in the streets of Beirut, including the tunnel leading to Rafic Hariri International Airport, adjacent to Dahieh, a Hezbollah stronghold. Heavy rains caused flooding that trapped people in their vehicles. Lebanese civil defense teams rescued those trapped, especially in the areas of Al-Hadath and A-Shweifat in Dahieh. Winter floods are not uncommon on the streets of Lebanon. However, unlike previous years, this year sees intense fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, with significant strikes deep into Lebanon after last winter’s strikes focused mainly on border villages and towns. The Lebanese Al-Mayadeen network, affiliated with Hezbollah, reported early Wednesday morning that Israeli Air Force planes continued to attack Dahieh, conducting about nine strikes on Hezbollah's stronghold by morning. These strikes followed a field tour and situational assessment in southern Lebanon by IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and the Northern Command commander. During the tour, Halevi told the soldiers: 'The IDF is working very hard in parallel, we heavily attacked Hezbollah targets. We are attacking deep and extensively in Syria and the Syria-Lebanon border to prevent weapons from reaching Hezbollah. Clearing this area will provide us with the basic conditions to do the right things, so that in the valley below it will truly be safe.' An article in the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat published in London in Arabic, discussed the expected impact of the rainy season on the war. It reported that winter is likely to delay the war but not stop it. The greatest impact is expected to be on ground combat, but even here, the impact is limited, mainly on the movement of soldiers and vehicles. According to experts, military actions relying on the Air Force will be even less affected, considering that winter in the region is not defined as severe compared to other parts of the world. One interviewee in the Saudi newspaper, a former senior Lebanese army officer named Abd al-Rahman Shahatili, claimed that the weather has 'no significant impact on the battle, as means have already been developed to fight under all conditions.' He argued that rain and fog in winter complicate ground combat but also help both sides, as they blur vision and assist Hezbollah fighters in both attacking and defending by camouflaging themselves. According to him, Israel, with its more advanced equipment, has an advantage in winter conditions, while Hezbollah fighters have to move on muddy and unpaved roads, complicating their activities. The article also noted that winter affects the morale of fighters and the living conditions of those who left their homes due to the war, which could lead to pressure to promote negotiations and a political settlement to end the war. Another former senior Lebanese army officer named Hassan Jouni told the newspaper that if there is a decision to continue the war, winter will not stop it. He claimed that the weather actually affects the attacker more than the attacked, and Hezbollah is prepared, familiar with the terrain and geography of southern Lebanon, and its targets are known. According to Jouni, because of Hezbollah's familiarity with the terrain, it is less affected by cold and rainy weather. He did note the impact of winter weather on vehicle movement but clarified that it is a limited impact that will not hinder continued fighting. He added that it is not extreme weather conditions, such as snow, heavy rains, and strong winds in the region, that are supposed to affect aerial activity, and that advanced aircraft, missiles and drones exist that can operate in such conditions.

Erdogan claims Turkey has 'severed ties with Israel'	In the wake of criticism in local media of Turkey's 'secret financial ties', Turkish president – who has spoken out harshly against Netanyahu since the beginning of the war – tells reporters that his country has severed relations with Israel; Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv is still operating and Jerusalem says not informed about cut in ties Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday told reporters that his country has severed diplomatic relations with Israel, although Jerusalem has not been informed of this. 'A Republic of Turkey that is headed by Tayyip Erdogan can't continue to develop its relationship with Israel. We have no such intention,' he was quoted as saying by local TV channel TRT Harber. 'We have cut trade and ties with Israel, period.' Since the beginning of the war, Erdogan has often made statements against Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Israel's policy in the Gaza Strip since the October 7 massacre. His announcement comes in in the wake of severe criticism of Erdogan in the Turkish media, where it is claimed that, contrary to his harsh public statements, there are apparently 'secret economic ties' with Israel. Turkey withdrew its ambassador in Israel for consultations after the Gaza war broke out, but has not officially severed its ties with Israel and its embassy remains open and operational. Erdogan also said on Wednesday that he still hopes meet with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to repair ties with the neighboring country, broadcaster CNN Turk reported. 'Restoring ties with Bashar al-Assad will soothe regional tensions, hopefully,' Erdogan was quoted as telling reporters on his flight back from Azerbaijan. Erdogan said he hopes U.S. President-elect Donald Trump would take a different approach on the Middle East during his term, but that some of the messages coming from his side were concerning, broadcaster NTV reported on Wednesday. 'It seems too early to me to make observations about this,' Erdogan told reporters on a return flight from Baku. 'Our hope is that Trump takes very different steps toward the region this term because the messages being given from time to time concern us,' he was cited as saying. Erdogan also reportedly said that Turkey could take joint steps with billionaire businessman Elon Musk on technology if opportunities for cooperation in that field arise, broadcaster TRT Haber reported. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday named Musk to a role aimed at creating a more efficient government, handing even more influence to the world's richest man who donated millions of dollars to helping Trump get elected. 'Musk is a businessman who works in the space and technology field,' Erdogan told reporters on the return flight from Baku. 'Technology isn't a field you can advance on your own, you absolutely need some cooperation. In the event cooperation opportunities arise in this field, steps can be taken with Musk,' he was cited as saying.

Israel calls on ICC in Hague to check neutrality of judge on pane...	The State of Israel on Wednesday submitted an unusual request to the International Criminal Court in The Hague (ICC), which is discussing the request of Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes in the Gaza Strip. The appeal concerns a request by Israel to check the neutrality of Judge Beti Hohler from Slovenia, who was recently added to the panel of judges in the case. Israel wants to make sure that the judge's previous involvement in the international prosecutor's office did not include access to secret information or involvement in discussions related to legal issues dealing with the Palestinians, which could harm her neutrality in the case of Netanyahu and Gallant.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryh69fgzjx	2024-11-13T03:31:24-08:00	
Erdogan hopes for new U.S. approach after 'concerning' Trump mess...	Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said he hopes U.S. President-elect Donald Trump would take a different approach on the Middle East during his term, but that some of the messages coming from his side were concerning, broadcaster NTV reported on Wednesday. 'It seems too early to me to make observations about this,' Erdogan told reporters on a return flight from Baku. 'Our hope is that Trump takes very different steps toward the region this term because the messages being given from time to time concern us,' he was cited as saying. Asked about Turkey's decision to halt all trade with Israel in May, Erdogan said Ankara had no trade ties with Israel at the moment and no desire to develop them. Turkey withdrew its ambassador in Israel for consultations after the Gaza war broke out, but has not officially severed its ties with Israel and its embassy remains open and operational. Erdogan also said China and Russia had signed an initiative that Turkey launched at the United Nations to impose a weapons embargo on Israel.

US wants real, extended pauses in fighting in Gaza, Blinken says	The United States wants real and extended pauses in fighting in Gaza so assistance can get to people who need it, but the best way to help people would be to end the war, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday. 'Israel, by the standards it set itself, has accomplished the goals that it set for itself,' Blinken told reporters during a visit to Brussels. 'This should be a time to end the war.' On Tuesday, after the expiration of a 30-day U.S. deadline for Israel to take steps to address the humanitarian situation in Gaza, Washington said Israel was not blocking aid to Gaza and therefore not violating U.S. law. Eight international aid groups said Israel had failed to meet the U.S. demands to improve access for assistance.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1c3lwmf1e	2024-11-13T02:01:09-08:00	
Saudi-Iranian geopolitical romance blossoms as Israel is cast asi...	Saudi Arabia and Iran, under the watchful mediation of China, are engaged in rebuilding relations marked by joint military exercises and economic cooperation, which strategically positions Saudi Arabia as a humanitarian conduit for Iran amid American sanctions; Normalization with Israel is not on the menu, at least for now A Sino-crafted rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran is currently unfolding. Just last month, Abbas Araqchi, Iran's foreign minister, didn't merely settle for a handshake with Saudi Arabia's Faisal bin Farhan. Instead, he was whisked off to a high-stakes meeting with the Crown Prince himself, Mohammed bin Salman. Beijing has been heavily involved in rekindling the love-hate relationship between Tehran and Riyadh. As the Middle Kingdom continues its whisper campaign, it nudged both nations to host Saudi Chief of Staff Fayyadh Al-Ruwaili in Tehran over a tense weekend. These ties, once severed by seven years of bitterness and shadowed by Iran's whispered denials of attacks on Saudi oil sanctuaries, are being meticulously reconstructed. The focus is now on joint military pirouettes in the Red Sea and economic bridges, with Saudi Arabia playing the role of a humanitarian lifeline, circumventing American embargoes to nourish Iran with essential goods. At an emergency summit in the heart of Riyadh, one year to the day since the Arab-Islamic conclave of 2023, the stage was set for a parade of Arab and Islamic leaders. Notably absent was Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian, his seat filled by a deputy bearing apologies and the weight of internal 'preparations' for an Israeli showdown. Crown Prince bin Salman's opening salvo was nothing short of a rhetorical missile aimed squarely at Israeli ears. His audacious critique sidelined American aspirations of brokering a Saudi-Israeli détente, as he boldly demanded a 'full withdrawal' from Gaza and the West Bank, and an immediate cessation of Israeli military maneuvers in Lebanon. His narrative expanded to include strikes in Iran and its proxies, a nod to Syria, Lebanon, and the Iraq-Syria border. In an interview with Ynet and Yedioth Aharonoth, a high-ranking academic and confidant of the Saudi elite offered a nuanced perspective. 'Prince bin Salman is a strategist with foresight, his gaze fixed on both the immediate and the horizon. Yes, he took a hard line against Israel at the summit, but the Israeli dossier is merely out of sight, not out of mind. The dialogue on relations will resume, but not now,' he said. Bin Salman's forceful oration directly addressed Israeli conduct, tracking IDF movements across multiple fronts, from Gaza to the depths of Iran, even touching upon Iraq. Curiously absent from Riyadh’s discourse were the Houthis of Yemen, a silence dictated by Saudi calculus. 'This summit's true audience resides in Washington. That it convened in Saudi Arabia, not Egypt, speaks volumes,' an anonymous Saudi commentator confided. 'The Crown Prince has seized the reins, leaving President el-Sisi to swallow his pride and follow suit, a reluctant participant in the reshaping of Arab leadership dynamics.' Professor Farid, another discreet Saudi voice, painted this diplomatic dance as a cautious yet bold pivot, not a robust peace but an artful maneuver. 'This pivot began with embassy doors reopening in Tehran and Riyadh and continues relentlessly. It's fraught with peril, yet both parties tread carefully,' he said. Speculations abound of a Saudi gambit delivered to the incoming U.S. president, Donald Trump, a proposal to thaw Washington-Tehran relations. Advisers on both sides are acutely aware of each other’s Achilles' heels. The American gaze never wavers from Iran's nuclear ambitions, while Tehran’s leadership expertly plays the Washington tune. Dr. Yoel Guzansky of the Institute for National Security Studies posits: 'The Saudis aim for a pragmatic rapprochement with Iran, seeking to sidestep the looming crossfire of an Iranian-Israeli flare-up anticipated before Trump's inauguration. Their pro-Iranian rhetoric is a strategic message of non-alignment with Israel’s actions.' The silence on Saudi internal affairs and human rights from Washington is deafening, as the Saudis pin their hopes on Trump pressuring Netanyahu to swiftly conclude conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, and to make strides on the Palestinian issue – a façade of progress toward a two-state solution. Today's bin Salman is a ruler transformed, his power and clarity sharpened over four years, yet his wary eye remains on Iran. Trump’s promise to quell wars resonates in Riyadh with Saudi Arabia, followed by Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon, poised for a shift in Washington’s winds. Their demand: An American arms embargo on Israel to halt the Israeli offensive. Hezbollah and Hamas were mere footnotes at the summit, as the Crown Prince gears up to collaborate with President Trump, painting a bleak tableau to 'end all wars.'

He added: 'If the prime minister was a reservist, the request would have been accepted, so if the prime minister is running the entire war and there are weeks when it is impossible to meet with him, then should that be ignored? We are not asking for a concession.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkhwhegzjl	2024-11-13T01:19:24-08:00

A sign of life and psychological terror, after more than 13 months in hell: Islamic Jihad releases for the third time since start of war a video of the hostage, who hold Russian citizenship; On Tuesday he celebrated his 29th birthday in captivity; Hostage's mother: 'We are all waiting for him to come back. What keeps me going is prayers and support from people I meet on the street' Islamic Jihad published released on Wednesday a several-minute video of hostage Sasha Trufanov , who has been held captive in Gaza for 404 days. Trufanov marked his 29th birthday this week, he second birthday he has spent in captivity. The family has not yet approved making the video and the things said in it public. On May 28, and also two days later, the terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip released videos of Trupanov from captivity. Sasha, who has Russian citizenship, was abducted on October 7 along with his mother Yelena, his grandmother Irena Tati, and his friend Sapir Cohen from the family home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. The three women were released in the hostage deal at the end of November, after 54 and 55 days in captivity. Sasha's father, Vitali, was massacred by Hamas terrorists on October 7. Sasha and his friend Sapir, who were visiting the kibbutz at the time of the surprise attack, were abducted to Gaza along with their mother Yelena and grandmother Irena Tati. In the last message he sent to his friends before he was kidnapped, Trofanov wrote: 'It's a shame I came to visit the kibbutz this weekend with Sapir.' From what Trufanov says in the video released on Wednesday, more than 13 months after the October 7, 2023 massacre, it is clear that it was filmed recently, although it is not certain exactly what day. Trofanov's upper body is all that is seen in the video. On Tuesday, the hostage's mother, Yelena, was interviewed by Ynet. In a special interview to mark her son's second birthday in captivity, she said that 'all the efforts until now have not brought any results.' Yelena Trufanov said that she hopes another deal will be struck under the radar. 'When there is too much talk, it's a deal that won't happen,' she said. Yelena said that her son is 'a smart, good and beautiful guy, as any mother would say. We are all waiting for him to come back already. What keeps me going is faith, prayers and support from the people I meet on the street. They tell me 'our hearts are with you', we pray and remember the support.'

Mike Huckabee says 'Incredibly honored' to serve as U.S. ambassad...	Huckabee, appointed by President-elect Trump, tells Army Radio it's an 'extraordinary opportunity to represent my country to a land that I have loved since I first visited there in 1973' Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who previously ran for U.S. president in the Republican primaries, is still processing President-elect Donald Trump’s announcement appointing him as the next U.S. ambassador to Israel. 'I'm just incredibly honored that the president would ask me to serve in this capacity,' he told Army Radio Wednesday morning. Huckabee spoke about his many visits to Israel, the first nearly 52 years ago. 'On a personal level, this is an extraordinary opportunity to be able to represent my country to a land that I have loved since I first visited there in July of 1973. Having taken tens of thousands of Americans to see the land, I can't tell you what a joy it is to be able to serve in this capacity,' he said. He addressed the possibility that the incoming Trump administration would support the annexation and extension of Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank. 'I have been a frequent visitor to Judea and Samaria, and I also firmly believe that the people of Israel deserve a safe country. Anything I can do to accommodate that that would be a big privilege for me.' However, he clarified, 'I won't make the policy, but I will execute the policy of the president, and he has already demonstrated in his first term that there has never been an American president that has been more helpful in securing an understanding of the sovereignty of Israel. From the moving of the embassy to recognizing the Golan Heights and Jerusalem as the capital, no one has done more than President Trump – and I fully expect that to continue.' Concerning a return to the Gaza Strip, he was notably more cautious. 'Today has been a pretty intense day, receiving literally hundreds of calls, emails, text messages, so, you know, I don’t want to make any comments about policy because those won't be mine to make,' he said. Huckabee, who will replace Amb. Jack Lew, a Joe Biden appointment, ran in the Republican presidential primaries in 2008, losing to John McCain, and eight years later losing to Trump. By training, he is an evangelical pastor, aligned with the Christian evangelical right in the U.S., and defines himself as a staunch supporter of Israel. He has also worked as a political commentator on Fox News. In 2015, while running for the Republican Party's presidential nomination, Huckabee visited the ancient West Bank site of Shiloh, the site of the biblical tabernacle. 'Judea and Samaria are an inseparable part of the State of Israel and everyone needs to understand that. Anyone running for the presidency of the United States should visit here,' he said while at Shiloh, using the biblical designations for the West Bank. In an interview with Ynet at the time he said that 'Israel needs to control Judea and Samaria'. He said, among other things, that Jewish settlement is 'a factor leading to regional peace.'

Biden to host hostage families at White House; Trump passes on me...	Hostage families with American citizenship will meet President Joe Biden at the White House on Wednesday, emphasizing the bipartisan effort with President-elect Donald Trump to secure their release; Despite a request by the families to meet the President-elect, who also is scheduled to see Biden on Wednesday, Trump declined citing 'schedule constraints' Families of hostages still held in Gaza, who are also U.S. citizens, are set to meet with President Joe Biden at the White House on Wednesday evening at around 10:00 p.m. Israel time. Biden also plans to meet with President-elect Donald Trump during the day, although Trump will not attend the meeting with the hostage families. This marks the third such gathering at the White House since the outbreak of the conflict. 'Our aim is to encourage the outgoing administration to collaborate vigorously and decisively with the incoming administration to resolve the situation and bring the hostages home. They must do whatever it takes,' Ronen Neutra, father of hostage Omer, told Ynet. This meeting with Biden follows a nighttime engagement during which families met with White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. They urged him and the administration to work with Trump and his transition team, dedicating all available resources to sign an agreement that will bring all the hostages back to Israel before Biden's term ends. In their 14th meeting with Sullivan since the war began, the families expressed gratitude for the administration's support for Israel. Sullivan reiterated the administration's 'unwavering commitment to bringing the hostages home,' emphasizing that the issue remains 'a top priority for President Biden.' 'After meeting with Sullivan, we encouraged him to engage with his new counterpart and begin collaborative efforts,' Neutra explained. 'Many new team members were appointed tonight, and it's crucial for these teams to start meeting. That was our objective, and we hope these meetings will expedite the process.' Neutra also noted that Trump conveyed his desire to resolve the hostage issue before taking office, with three months available to achieve this. 'Now we must work with full force and, ultimately, both leaders deserve credit if they succeed. It's up to them now. We are very hopeful to hear from President Biden that this issue transcends party lines and that the teams will quickly commence joint work.' Meanwhile, sources from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said that the families made a request for an official meeting with Trump, but due to the president-elect's 'schedule constraints,' it did not materialize. On Tuesday, President Isaac Herzog met with Biden, expressing gratitude for his continued support for Israel throughout his presidency. Herzog acknowledged Biden's efforts for the hostages' release and stressed that Israel is preparing for the 'day after' in Gaza, but emphasized that the hostages' return is paramount. The president agreed. At the meeting's conclusion, Herzog remarked that he anticipates the coming period will present 'many challenges related to Israel's security and numerous critical issues concerning bilateral relations.'

Russia asks Israel to avoid attacks near its base in Syria	Russia asked Israel to refrain from airstrikes near its air base in Syria, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin's envoy to Syria, Alexander Lavrentiev. Last month, state media in Syria reported on an Israeli airstrike in the port city of Latakia, one of the bastions of control of Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is supported by Russia. The city is close to the Russian base. 'Israel did attack from the air in the vicinity of the base,' Lavrentiev said in an interview with the Russian news agency RIA. 'Our army informed Israeli officials that such actions, which could endanger the lives of army personnel, are unacceptable.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjiltczfkl	2024-11-12T22:47:04-08:00	
‘October 7 changed everything’: Inside the Jewish world’s bold ne...	Kol Ha’am CEO says new voices are needed After October 7 and a year of war, is it time to bring new voices into the Jewish community? According to Shirel Dagan-Levy, CEO of Voice of the People (Kol Ha’am), an initiative by President Isaac Herzog, 'our strength is to have diverse voices.' Dagan-Levy attended all three days of the Jewish Federations of North America General Assembly, where she met with both established and emerging Jewish communal leaders. An Israeli with a background in high-tech, Dagan-Levy has been tasked with launching the president’s Kol Ha’am initiative, which aims to create a global Jewish advisory council to address pressing issues impacting Jewish communities worldwide. She told ILTV News that the GA was both inspiring and emphasized the necessity of the Kol Ha’am project. 'On the one hand, I see the strength. I mean, this is unbelievable. I mean, people, for years, are doing for the Jewish community. I'm overwhelmed. I'm humbled,' she told ILTV. 'I think people in Israel don't realize how much people here care. They just don't realize.' On the other hand, she said, 'we need to bring new voices and new ideas and tackle [the challenges in the Jewish world] differently.' Her goal: To manage this tension and turn it into discussion and action. Kol Ha’am launched two years ago, before the October 7 massacre. But soon after the attack, the president realized the concept needed to be reimagined. His office sent a survey to the global Jewish community, which more than 10,000 people answered. It asked questions about the most important issues in the Jewish community and how they could be addressed. Then, the project opened an application process to create a cohort of 150 people—50 from Israel, 50 from the United States, and another 50 from around the world. Around 1,000 people applied. The application process was powered by artificial intelligence to ensure the cohort would be as diverse and representative as possible. Applicants filled out AI-driven forms, which the algorithm narrowed down to a list of about 400 of the most suitable candidates. Now, the human team must sift through these resumes. 'We got unbelievable names of people,' Dagan-Levy said. 'We’re looking for the non-usual suspects. I mean, we want the usual suspects, but I think we have an opportunity post-October 7 to bring new voices, young voices, voices that have never stood up before.' The goal is for 75% of participants to be under the age of 50. They are aiming for a balanced representation of men and women, Orthodox and non-Orthodox, business professionals, and individuals already deeply engaged in the Jewish world. Dagan-Levy noted that many young Jews who had never previously engaged with Jewish life or discussed Judaism are now starting to get involved since October 7. 'They want to step up and do something,' she said. The Kol Ha’am team is also interviewing moderators and facilitators, aiming to launch 10 working groups on different topics by early winter. The first cohort is expected to be announced in mid-December and will serve for two years. 'This is not a think tank,' Dagan-Levy emphasized. 'I want them to come up with actionable solutions… How can we actually change reality? We want those proactive leaders to come as thinkers and doers.' Dagan-Levy is herself one of these proactive individuals. She spent most of her career in high-tech, but after October 7, while serving as CEO of a startup, she felt that 'everything seemed irrelevant,' and she sought greater meaning. Kol Ha’am was a perfect fit. 'I think the magic of President Herzog is that in these very difficult, hard days, he is able to look to the future and say, you know, we have to look at the future and take care of it, because no one else is going to do it for us,' she told ILTV.

Expert: Israel cannot claim victory over Hezbollah	Avraham Levine of Alma Center ells ILTV News that Hezbollah and Lebanon are different Israel cannot and should not claim victory over Hezbollah, according to an expert from Israel’s North. 'Until we bring our people back to the north, our kids back to school, safely back to normal life here in the North, until then, while Hezbollah is shooting rockets, we cannot claim victory,' said Avraham Levine of the Alma Research and Education Center. He added, 'We have eliminated many of the command, but we still haven’t beaten Hezbollah.' Levine also cautioned that Israel should distinguish between Lebanon and Hezbollah. He explained that while Lebanon is ready for a ceasefire, it is unclear if Hezbollah will agree to such an arrangement. 'I do not see that happening, but a de facto agreement with Hezbollah might be on its way,' Levine said.

Will Trump recognize Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria in ...	Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich claims new U.S. administration will end demand for Palestinian state Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who heads the National Religious Party, stated at a press conference that he hopes the incoming Trump administration will recognize Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria in 2025 and put an end to U.S. demands for a Palestinian state. 'The year 2025 will be, with God's help, the year of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria,' Smotrich said. 'I instructed the Settlement Administration at the Security Ministry and the Civil Administration to begin professional and comprehensive staff work and prepare in practice the necessary infrastructure for the application of sovereignty.' Smotrich expressed his belief that Trump can lead the way to a truly new Middle East. 'Following this past year, we are the strongest in the Middle East,' Smotrich said. 'We will apply sovereignty together with our American friends. We’ll extend the agreements and alliances with neighboring countries, and we’ll create a true new Middle East.' Meanwhile, anti-terror operations are ongoing in Judea and Samaria. IDF forces and the Shin Bet arrested Hamas operatives in a series of sweeps targeting wanted men in several towns. The army has been working intensively since last October to contain an upsurge in terrorist violence in the region. The Ephraim Division arrested four wanted men and confiscated a drone and military equipment. Three additional suspects were arrested by the Shomron Division. There were no casualties among IDF forces.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1izdawmyl	2024-11-12T21:31:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/07/01/HJRFwmgwR/HJRFwmgwR_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg
‘Antisemitism is problem of left, right’	ILTV News reports from the Jewish Federation of North America’s General Assembly In the heart of Washington, D.C., Jewish communities from around the world came together to make their voices heard at the 2024 Jewish Federations of North America General Assembly. The three-day event, which began on Sunday, brought together over 2,500 Jews from across North America and beyond to discuss today’s most pressing issues. The event unfolded in the shadow of a series of antisemitic attacks. 'Antisemitism is not a Jewish problem,' said JTA Washington Bureau Chief Ron Kampeas. 'It's a non-Jewish problem. It's a problem of the Christian community. It's a problem of certain Muslim communities. For sure, it's a problem of the left. It's a problem of the right.' The conference also served as an opportunity to shape the Jewish future, amplifying local voices, deepening connections to shared culture and heritage, and creating lasting change for future generations. 'One thing we have learned since October 7 is that on the days after October 7, when we look to our left and our right to see our friends who we thought were there—the friends who we had marched with, the friends that we had advocated for—we found that so many of them were not there,' said William Daroff, CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. 'One thing that has crystallized is that we as a Jewish community need to count on and can really count on each other, and we're only as strong as we are unified,' he continued. 'I think that that's an area that is focused here, and I think it's the direction that we as a community need to continue to go in order to ensure that we will survive and thrive as we have for thousands of years.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skembabgjg	2024-11-12T21:27:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/11/13/SyVL8TWMJe/SyVL8TWMJe_0_0_957_539_0_small.jpg

Actor John Krasinski named People magazine's 'sexiest man alive'	Actor and director John Krasinski was named People magazine's 'sexiest man alive' for 2024 on Wednesday, taking over the mantle from 'Grey's Anatomy' actor Patrick Dempsey. The actor is perhaps best known for his sardonic nice guy role in the television comedy 'The Office'. Krasinski, 45, lives in Brooklyn with his wife of 14 years, actress Emily Blunt, 41, and their daughters Hazel, 10, and Violet, 8. Recently, Krasinski has directed the comedy 'IF' and the dramas 'A Quiet Place' and 'A Quiet Place Part II,' both featuring Blunt in a leading role. However, he noted that the new title will change things very little around the house. 'I think it's going to make me do more household chores,' he joked.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1jpvt11mkx	2024-11-12T21:20:01-08:00	
Bride and groom take cover from rockets during wedding photo shoo...	Yarden Salem and Liel Madmon hit the ground on a hillside in Hod Hasharon, already dressed in a wedding gown and suit, during a rocket barrage targeting central Israel; 'A classic moment capturing an Israeli couple getting married in the shadow of war'; See the photos Newlyweds-to-be Yarden Salem and Liel Madmon, from Kadima, experienced a dramatic moment during their wedding photo shoot on Tuesday at the ecological garden in Hod Hasharon. In the midst of the session, just hours before their wedding ceremony, a rocket siren sounded, forcing the couple to seek cover while dressed in their wedding gown and suit. 'There wasn’t a nearby shelter,' said Ilan Lorentzky, a press and wedding photographer who, along with fellow photographer Arnon Cohen, captured the couple's exciting day on film. 'We moved to the side of a hill, crouched down, and covered our heads. The Iron Dome interceptions were right above us, and we could hear the terrifying explosions. This is our reality, but we’ll keep celebrating tonight – we have to find joy.' 'This is our reality, but we’ll keep celebrating tonight – we have to find joy' Liel, the bride, shared: 'While we were crouching, we started singing ‘Am Yisrael Chai’ and prayed for the safety of the soldiers and hostages. Even with a siren blaring in the background, we kept our spirits high.' Yarden, the groom, added: 'We always worried something might go wrong today. Getting married in times like these is crazy. But like my wise bride said — God is watching over us.' After a 10-minute wait following the siren, the couple proceeded to their wedding venue. Just before stepping under the chuppah, they reflected: 'Here we are now, incredibly excited. The siren is behind us, and tonight, we celebrate. Thanks to the photographers for capturing such a classic moment that shows an Israeli couple getting married under the shadow of a war.'

President-elect Donald Trump moved to build out his foreign policy team Tuesday, announcing he is nominating Fox News host and Army veteran Pete Hegseth as his defense secretary, and former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe to lead the Central Intelligence Agency. Hegseth, 44, is a co-host of Fox News Channe 'Fox & Friends Weekend' and has been a contributor with the network since 2014, where he developed a friendship with Trump, who made regular appearances on the show. He is also the author of'The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.' Hegseth was an infantry captain in the Army National Guard and served overseas in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He was formerly head of the Concerned Veterans for America, a group backed by conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, and he unsuccessfully ran for the Senate in Minnesota in 2012. 'With Pete at the helm, America's enemies are on notice... Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down,' Trump said in a statement. 'Nobody fights harder for the Troops, and Pete will be a courageous and patriotic champion of our 'Peace through Strength' policy.' In a flurry of announcements, Trump said he had chosen former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as ambassador to Israel and his longtime friend Steven Witkoff to be a special envoy to the Middle East.

Biden administration wants to sanction Ben-Gvir before leaving Wh...	With two months left as US president, Biden aims to impose sanctions on the National Security Minister, hoping to create a domino effect of sanctions in countries around the world The U.S. State Department is contemplating imposing sanctions on National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir during the final stretch of President Joe Biden's tenure, according to sources familiar with the matter. These sanctions aim to balance the backlash stemming from the administration's decision not to impose an arms embargo on Israel, following an ultimatum letter. On Tuesday evening, the U.S. declared that Israel is not in violation of U.S. law on humanitarian aid to Gaza. State Department officials are urging Secretary of State Antony Blinken to endorse the sanctions against Ben-Gvir – a move unprecedented in the annals of U.S.-Israel relations, which would mark the first time that the U.S. would impose sanctions on a sitting government minister. The U.S. has already sanctioned several organizations and individuals in the West Bank, alleging that they are involved in violence against Palestinians. The Americans anticipate that a Trump administration would likely rescind the sanctions immediately upon taking office on January 20. However, they are banking on a 'domino effect,' in which a slew of countries and entities, including the European Union, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, would follow suit and levy sanctions against Ben-Gvir. Thus, even if Trump were to annul the sanctions, they would probably remain intact in other parts of the world. The sanctions envisioned by the State Department would bar Ben-Gvir from visiting the U.S. and prevent American entities from transferring funds to him. In recent months, the U.S. has also weighed sanctions against Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. Still, it is believed the administration will refrain from doing so, understanding that Smotrich might retaliate by not renewing Israeli banks' permission to engage with Palestinian banks in the West Bank, potentially leading to the Palestinian Authority's economic collapse. Recently, Smotrich extended this permission for just one month. Globally, Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, who hold relatively senior government positions, are effectively boycotted. Beyond the U.S., senior European officials also avoid engaging with them in any professional capacity. Last month, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that London is considering sanctions on Smotrich and Ben-Gvir due to some of their statements about Gazan civilians, which he labeled as 'abhorrent.' As of yet, the UK has not declared sanctions against them, despite their remarks concerning Gaza Strip residents amid the ongoing conflict. The National Security Minister sparked international outrage by calling for the cessation of humanitarian aid and fuel transfers to Gaza until all hostages are returned and also for advocating for 'encouraging migration and conquering the Gaza Strip territories to hold them permanently.' Smotrich, for his part, stated at an August conference that Israel provides aid to the Gaza Strip 'because there is no choice' and suggested it 'might be moral to starve two million Gazans.' His remarks ignited a global uproar, echoed by international media and shared widely across various platforms by network influencers. In addition to potentially sanctioning Ben-Gvir, the U.S. issued a warning Tuesday evening that legislation against UNRWA could lead to 'consequences,' as stated by the Deputy State Department spokesperson. 'There are still two months before the legislation takes effect, and we continue to discuss this with the Israeli government, clarifying that steps preventing essential aid to citizens could have legal and policy repercussions,' said Vedant Patel. Addressing the decision not to impose an arms embargo on Israel, he noted: 'We will continue monitoring Israel's actions and evaluate if they comply with American law. Should we find any non-compliance, we will take appropriate measures.'

US judge blocks Louisiana from requiring Ten Commandments in clas...	A federal judge on Tuesday declared unconstitutional a Louisiana law requiring that the Ten Commandments be displayed in all public school classrooms in the state. The decision by U.S. District Judge John deGravelles, who called the law 'discriminatory and coercive,' is a temporary setback for conservative groups trying to make expressions of faith more prominent in society. Louisiana schools would have been required to comply with the state law by Jan. 1. Liz Murrill, the state's Republican attorney general, said in a statement: 'We strongly disagree with the court's decision and will immediately appeal.' An appeal would go to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, widely considered among the most conservative federal appeals courts. DeGravelles said Louisiana's law conflicted with a 1980 U.S. Supreme Court decision voiding a similar law in Kentucky, and violated the religious rights of people who opposed the displays. Louisiana became the only U.S. state requiring displays of the Ten Commandments when Republican Governor Jeff Landry signed the law on June 19. The law requires the display of posters or framed versions of the Ten Commandments that are at least 11 inches by 14 inches. Nine families, including several clergy, with children in public schools sued five days later in Baton Rouge, Louisiana's capital, seeking an injunction against the law.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjwxmrwmjl	2024-11-12T12:08:19-08:00	
Iran, Russia link bank card systems in latest move to overcome sa...	Iranian bank cards are now operational in Russia, following the integration of Iran's Shetab network with Russia's Mir; This collaboration aims to mitigate impact of sanctions, with plans to expand the system to other nations with strong Iranian ties Iranian bank cards can now be used in Russia, state television reported, as the two countries linked their banking systems in the latest bid to counteract sanctions. Iranian banks have been excluded since 2018 from the SWIFT international financial messaging service, which governs the vast majority of transactions worldwide. The move is part of a raft of sanctions that were re-imposed on Iran after the United States withdrew from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal. Iranian bank cards can now be used in Russia, state television channel IRINN said on Monday, showing the withdrawal of money using an Iranian bank card from an ATM in Russia. The operation was made possible by connecting Iran's interbank network Shetab to its Russian equivalent Mir, the channel said. Iranians can currently withdraw money in Russia, and will in the future be able to use their cards to pay for in-store purchases, it added. 'The plan is also going to be implemented in other countries that have a wide range of financial and social interactions with Iran, for example Iraq, Afghanistan and Turkey,' it said. Both Iran and Russia have sought to counteract the effects of sanctions on their economies. Since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has faced mounting sanctions, and its ties with Tehran have grown closer in parallel. Ukraine and its Western allies have since the start of the conflict accused Iran of supplying Russia with both drones and missiles for use in the war. Tehran and Moscow signed an agreement in June to strengthen their cooperation in the banking sector. In the future, Russians will also be able to use their bank cards in Iran, IRINN said, without specifying when. Russia has been pushing for the creation of an international payment platform as an alternative to the SWIFT service, from which key Russian banks have also been excluded since 2022.

Herzog says Gaza hostages are top priority in White House meeting...	President Isaac Herzog thanked Biden for his support for Israel and the Jewish people, and says that Israel is working for the 'day after' in Gaza; He also asserted that Iran can't achieve a nuclear weapon and fulfill it's intention to annihilate Israel President Isaac Herzog met with U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House on Tuesday, expressing gratitude for Biden's ongoing support of Israel during his presidency. Herzog acknowledged Biden’s efforts toward securing the release of hostages and emphasized that while Israel is working to ensure a stable 'day after' in the Gaza Strip, the return of the hostages remains the top priority. President Biden concurred. Herzog was welcomed to the White House by U.S. Chief of Protocol Eitan Weiss and signed the official guest book in the Roosevelt Room. At the start of their meeting, which took place amid a deadlock in hostage negotiations and efforts to reach an agreement in Lebanon, Biden told Herzog, 'You're a long time a personal friend. And, you know that my commitment to Israel is ironclad, and we share a deep friendship.' 'We are fighting hard. We are defending our people with our brave soldiers and pilots. I know you are working very hard to make sure this war ends and for first and foremost the security for the people of Israel as well as for the people of Lebanon. ,' Herzog said. 'In Gaza, we have 101 hostages over 400 days,' Herzog continued, 'I know, Mr. President, that you're day in, day out, actively seeking their safe return home as they're going through hell in the dungeons of Gaza. Clearly, you're thinking and working about the day after as well, which perhaps should be a trajectory of hope to the people of the region and the ability have our neighbors as well as ours security. But first we need to get our hostages back.' Biden responded, 'I agree.' 'It all starts in Tehran. It all starts in the empire of evil, where Tehran with its proxies, they're doing whatever they can to erase stability and security and peace, calling for the annihilation of the State of Israel and seeking nuclear weapons. Mr. President, this has to be a major objective - all throughout your term and the next term and the next president - because we have to make sure that they cannot fulfill their evil intentions. They're also a major engine of antisemitism, Mr. President, and I know how much you put a focus on fighting and combating, antisemitism.'

This is the next US ambassador to Israel: Mike Huckabee says Isra...	Former Arkansas governor will replace Biden appointee Jack Lew; The evangelical Christian minister ran in the Republican presidential primaries twice, is considered a strong supporter of Israel and the settlements, and has said that he considered buying a house in the settlement of Efrat The next U.S. ambassador to Israel will be Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas who ran twice in the Republican presidential primaries for the presidency, Presidedt-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday. Huckabee will replace Jack Lew, who was appointed by President Joe Biden. Huckabee ran in the 2008 Republican primaries and lost to John McCain, and eight years later lost to Trump. Huckabee is identified with the evangelical Christian right in the United States, and defines himself as a great supporter of Israel. He is an evangelical minister by training, and served as a political commentator on the right-wing Fox News. In 2015, while running for the Republican Party's presidential nomination, Huckabee visited the ancient West Bank site of Shiloh, the site of the biblical tabernacle. 'Judea and Samaria are an inseparable part of the State of Israel and everyone needs to understand that. Anyone running for the presidency of the United States should visit here,' he said while at Shiloh, using the biblical designations for the West Bank. In an interview with Ynet at the time he said that 'Israel needs to control Judea and Samaria'. He said, among other things, that Jewish settlement is 'a factor leading to regional peace.' Huckabee, who is considered an ardent supporter of the annexation of the West Bank, has also said in the past that he is considering buying a house in the settlement of Efrat. Apart from his visit to Shiloh, he also prayed at Joseph's Tomb in Nablus and has rejected the two-state solution. 'What has been built here is a bridge to peace,' he said when he visited Efrat in the Etzion bloc in 2018, while emphasizing the economic partnership with Palestinian workers who, according to him, receive improved wages and conditions compared to in the Palestinian Authority. Huckabee called for continued construction in the area, as opposed to freezes that were customary during the Obama administration. The choice of Huckabee is also interesting because it was thought that if Trump did not appoint David Friedman as Secretary of State, he might ask him to return to serve as ambassador to Israel. In the end, Marco Rubio has been appointed Secretary of State; Rubio also was defeated by Trump in the Republican primaries in 2016. Huckabee is also considered a vocal critic of singer Beyoncé, claiming that her content and shows are not suitable for children. He criticized her cultural influence, especially on young people, and called her conduct 'too provocative.' Huckabee even addressed Beyoncé's relationship with her husband, the rapper Jay-Z, and claimed that he sometimes presents her in a disrespectful way. His positions received widespread reactions in the media, and some have seen them as part of the conservative trends and religious values ​​that guide him, while others have accused him of an unnecessary entry into the popular cultural discourse.

Kissufim crossing opens to deliver aid to Gaza, angering kibbutz ...	The Israeli government's decision to open another crossing for humanitarian aid to Gaza, under orders from the U.S. , has sparked outrage among local residents, who cite unresolved trauma and security concerns; 'Through the crossing, dozens of Israelis were kidnapped,' they write in letter to Biden The Israeli government has announced the start of humanitarian aid deliveries via the reopened Kissufim Crossing, a move driven by directives from the political leadership and aimed at bolstering the flow and routes of aid into the Gaza Strip. This initiative, which began on Tuesday, involves the dispatch of humanitarian aid trucks carrying essentials such as food, water, medical supplies and shelter materials to central and southern Gaza. The decision has sparked outrage among the residents of Kibbutz Kissufim, who have expressed their anger in a letter to President Joe Biden, describing their feelings as a 'personal and national trauma.' This development comes amid significant American pressure and the looming threat of a U.S. arms embargo unless humanitarian aid deliveries increase, though the latter has subsided following the election of Donald Trump. The crossing's opening was coordinated with Israeli forces through the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Southern Command, and the Land Crossings Authority within the Ministry of Defense. The aid was permitted entry into Gaza following security inspections at the Kerem Shalom crossing. In their letter to President Biden, members of Kibbutz Kissufim emphasized: 'The place called 'Kissufim Crossing' is the point from which hundreds of Hamas terrorists and Gazan civilians crossed on October 7 with the intention to murder, rape and burn the surrounding kibbutzim - including Kissufim.' They expressed gratitude to the U.S. president for his support of Israel but noted that they were informed about the crossing's reopening, reportedly at his request, through media reports. 'Through this crossing, dozens of Israelis were kidnapped, including 87-year-old Shlomo Mansour, who is still captive,' they said. 'The opening of the crossing fuels our personal and national trauma. It is unacceptable. We expect the 101 hostages to return through this crossing - soon. You know how deep our pain is.' Mansour’s daughter, Moshit, addressed the proximity of the Kissufim Crossing to the kibbutz, highlighting the continued absence of the hostages for 403 days and criticizing Israel's prioritization of humanitarian aid to Gaza over the security and well-being of its own citizens. 'The hostages have not returned, bringing Gaza residents closer to the Kissufim border fence, and continue to abandon the lives of the soldiers in the fighting without clear targets,' she said. The situation escalated when the IDF reported the discovery of ammunition within a humanitarian aid convoy in Gaza for the first time. During a coordinated international convoy monitored by military forces, suspicion arose of unusual movement, prompting a security inspection at the humanitarian corridor between the north and south of the strip. Israeli forces found a bag containing ammunition for firearms. The military detailed that those involved, along with convoy members, were detained for field investigation by Unit 504, with further handling by IDF and security forces. This incident surfaces as the Israeli cabinet deliberates on expanding aid to Gazans, a decision already being implemented by the military with dozens of daily truck deliveries. The policy shift comes under intense American pressure, despite concerns the aid might be seized by Hamas. According to a report by The Guardian, the volume of aid entering Gaza has plummeted to its lowest level since December 2023, amid U.S. arms embargo threats. COGAT's data prompted the cabinet to address the issue in a recent discussion, resulting in the decision to expand aid, although visits to Gazan detainees remain prohibited. Officials in Jerusalem hope that upcoming diplomatic engagements in Washington will alleviate the threat. Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, closely associated with Prime Minister Netanyahu, is slated to meet with senior U.S. officials and President-elect Donald Trump, while President Isaac Herzog will confer with outgoing President Joe Biden. The American ultimatum, demanding Israeli compliance within 30 days, was issued on October 13 and is nearing its deadline. It remains uncertain what measures, if any, the U.S. administration will adopt against Israel should it fail to meet Washington's demands.

The heavy toll of continued fighting in Jabaliya - 24 soldiers ki...	Jabaliya in northern Gaza remains a tough stronghold to crack, as more than 200 explosives-rigged buildings were uncovered in 6 weeks of intensive combat, and according to IDF estimations the operation will last at least several more weeks Fighting in Jabaliya has entered its second month and is continuing to take a heavy toll. Five soldiers were killed there within a single day in two separate incidents, bringing the death toll among Israeli troops fighting there to 24 since the operation in Jabaliya began just six weeks ago. Despite two previous IDF raids on the city in the past year — one in December and another in May and June — Jabaliya remains a focus of intensive combat. During operations by the Kfir Brigade in the area, troops located and destroyed rocket launchers aimed at Israeli communities along the Gaza border. Additionally, IDF forces uncovered Hamas uniforms, military equipment, AK-47 rifles, and weapons components. The Kfir Brigade has neutralized around 50 terrorists in close-quarters combat and airstrikes and dismantled dozens of terrorist infrastructures. Lt. Col. Yoel, commander of the Shimshon Battalion, commented near a discovered rocket launcher: 'Right here beside me is a launch site. This is where Hamas launches rockets at Israel's Gaza border communities. We will reach any location the enemy uses to set up launch facilities or anything targeting Israeli civilians. We will find it, destroy it, and eliminate the threat.' Israeli forces are continuing to fortify a new cross-beam axis around the northern third of Gaza. This route cuts between Gaza City and Jabaliya to its north, enhancing control over the area. The combat patterns have remained largely unchanged in the sixth week of the raid: Forces sweep Hamas strongholds, primarily within Jabaliya's refugee camp, and apply pressure on two nearby towns, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia, encouraging any remaining civilians to move southward toward Gaza City – and ideally beyond the Nitzarim area to the southern part of Gaza. IDF forces are discovering weapons caches daily and engaging with terrorists regularly. The primary threat remains IEDs: Hamas has rigged more than 200 buildings in Jabaliya, primarily with 'dumb' explosives using improvised tripwires but without surveillance cameras. The IDF estimates this operation will be more prolonged than previous ones, potentially lasting several more weeks. Three IDF brigades under the 162nd Division are participating in the raid. The IDF has identified Jabaliya as a core Hamas stronghold in northern Gaza, where hundreds of terrorists — including senior commanders — have converged. Despite the IDF managing to evacuate tens of thousands of residents from the city over the past month, breaking what the IDF describes as a 'fear barrier' imposed by Hamas, a few thousand civilians remain.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Jewish leaders via v...	At the General Assembly of the Jewish Federations of North America event meant to promote Jewish unity and provide a gathering space for leaders in the Jewish communities of North America, Israeli cabinet ministers are notably absent Leaders from the North American Jewish community took over the halls of the Marriott Marquis in Washington, DC on Monday and Tuesday for the General Assembly of the Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA). Over 2,000 Jewish communal leaders and philanthropists from all over the U.S. and Canada were present in addition to a handful of guests from around the globe. Yet as the crowd gathered, a notable absence cast a shadow: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was nowhere to be seen, nor was any one of his 37 cabinet ministers. The Israeli daily Haaretz claims that Netanyahu was not been invited to this year’s General Assembly for the first time in his many years as prime minister. A JFNA spokesperson refuted the report, however, saying that the prime minister was indeed invited. Given Israel’s seven-front war and logistical challenges, he chose to deliver a video address, as he has done many times before, according to the spokesperson. The address was to be played during a plenary on Tuesday morning in Washington DC. The Prime Minister’s Office declined to comment. There may have been a strategic choice by JFNA to focus on unity rather than Israeli politics, General Assembly participants suggested. JFNA’s intent to focus on unity may be a response to the ongoing war on Israel's southern and northern borders and the surge of antisemitism affecting both American college campuses and the Jewish community at large. On the eve of the unity rally that launched the assembly, the only kosher restaurant in the nation’s capital was vandalized, with two of its windows smashed. The Jewish Federation of Greater Washington called the incident 'deeply disturbing' in a Sunday morning statement and urged a full investigation. William Daroff, CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, said that many Israeli ministers chose to stay in Israel given the ongoing war. He also noted that the event is more focused on connections between Jewish communities than on connections between the Israeli and American governments. 'I know that a number of Israeli ministers want to stay close to home given the war,' Daroff said. 'The focus [of the GA] is on the people of Israel and not the government,' he added. 'We are more than just government-to-government; it is people-to-people. At the end of the day, this [event] is about the American Jewish community connecting with the Israeli Jewish community.' 'The government, political piece can be divisive,' Daroff concluded. 'If the focus here is not politics and government but rather how people can be unified – must be unified – then the content should follow.' The relationship between American Jewry and the Israeli government has been strained since the current Israeli administration took office in December 2022. The October 7 massacre boosted Jewish unity, and JFNA raised substantial funds to support Israel in the wake of the attacks. JFNA said in August that it had raised $854 million for Israel since October 7, 2023, much of which was allocated directly to local nonprofits. Around $75 million of the funds were dedicated to northern Israel, where constant rocket fire from Hezbollah has displaced over 60,000 people from their homes. Increased solidarity with Israel following October 7 notwithstanding, many American Jews have voiced opposition to the current Israeli government. American Jews tend to be left-leaning and supportive of figures like Vice President Kamala Harris, who received nearly 80% of the Jewish vote. Survey data released last week by the left-leaning Zionist organization J Street showed that 66% of American Jews favor sanctioning far-right Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich for allegedly supporting violent settler attacks on Palestinians. The survey also highlighted a sharp decline in Netanyahu’s popularity among American Jews, with just 32% viewing him favorably and 63% viewing him unfavorably. Data from an October survey by the Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI) reveal further strain in the relationship between U.S. Jews and Israel. Politically conservative Jews feel nearly as connected to Israel as they did when the war began, the JPPI study found, but left-leaning Jews are increasingly disconnected. About 38% of 'strong liberals' reported feeling more distant from Israel due to the war, up from 29% of the same group in July. The JPPI study also noted decreasing support for the Israeli military among the most liberal respondents. 69% of the most liberal group said in October that Israel’s actions were excessively aggressive; in January, only 51% of the group said the same. A different JPPI study, released a week before the election, showed that 95% of the Jewish Americans supporting Donald Trump cited Israel as a key factor in casting their vote. In contrast, Israel was cited as a key factor for only 31% of strong Harris supporters. Despite the tensions between American Jews and the Israeli government, participants at the JFNA GA generally refrained from openly criticizing the Israeli government. Few voiced disappointment at the lack of Israeli government officials physically present. Jess Dolgin, CEO of J Media Global, said it was not the first time Netanyahu sent a video instead of attending personally, 'but it’s the first time Israel is facing seven fronts, and his time is probably better spent managing that,' he said. Meredith Jacobs, CEO of Jewish Women International, pointed out that representatives from the Israeli Embassy in Washington spoke at the event, as did several Israeli speakers, including hostage family members and nonprofit leaders. 'Israel has enough work to do right now, and I am happy if they are in Israel doing their work,' JWI Chief Program Officer Deborah Rosenbloom said of Israeli government officials. 'The GA is about the leadership of the American Jewish community. It just feels like there are other opportunities [to host Israeli ministers]. I don’t feel like it’s missed.' President Isaac Herzog attended the event and spoke Monday afternoon, praising attendees for mobilizing for Israel 'like a family.' He noted that American Jews had traveled to Israel to volunteer and to comfort mourners. 'You chose to demonstrate solidarity, to bear witness, to fight,' he told the crowd. 'You chose to show up for us when we needed you the most. The warmth and the affection expressed by world Jewry gave Israelis a lifeline and motivation to persevere. This was our finest hour – and your finest hour.' -This article is written by Maayan Hoffman and reprinted with permission from The Media Line Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bkgznwbfjg	2024-11-12T09:08:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/11/12/BJkewbbzJl/BJkewbbzJl_0_227_750_423_0_small.jpg

Herzog also thanked Biden for his support for Israel: 'We will never forget, ever, in history how you stood up with us in our darkest hour, which became our finest hour, how you came to Israel a few days after the barbaric attack of October 7th, how you helped us and supported us with words and deeds.' Herzog also called for the return of the hostages from Gaza. Biden replied: 'I agree.

At a dance party with Beyonce': Donald Trump's brand strategy fo...	There’s no other way to put it - Trump is a marketing genius and his brand strategy is an impressive mix of innovation and entertainment; Trump deeply understands how to market his brand in the new media age, This is Trump's brand strategy that brought him his victory Trump 2024: A well-oiled trend machine on TikTok Trump’s activity on TikTok is nothing less than a model of marketing mastery, as he simply knows how it works. He uses content shared by his supporters and even his opponents, who create catchy 'sounds' that fit the viral nature of the platform. With his unique talent, Trump has crafted sounds that people use humorously, reinforcing his image as one of the people with a sharp, clear political message. Trump has created endless sounds and trends on TikTok. Sounds like 'Joe Biden is asleep, and Kamala is at a dance party with Beyonce' captures his views on Biden and Harris's governance in the Middle East, or his dance trend to the song 'YMCA' by the Village People makes his brand visible everywhere, to every age, and in every language. Trump embraces a bold approach that allows him to be 'authentic' – a valuable asset in the social media era. In contrast to Kamala Harris, who comes across as robotic, reading from a teleprompter and struggling in interviews (maybe due to Trump’s portrayal?), Trump shoots from the hip and doesn’t need talking points. This builds a more reliable image against his competitors. The people's media vs traditional press Donald Trump understood long ago that to reach his supporters directly and achieve virality, there’s no point in relying on established media outlets, many of which criticize him. He’s also aware of his weaknesses, adapting messages for each platform accordingly. Instead, he turns to social media and more 'popular' platforms, allowing him to deliver unfiltered messages without traditional media filters and commentary. A notable example is Trump’s use of TikTok, appealing to young audiences. Moreover, in the current race, Trump chose to appear on popular podcasts like 'The Joe Rogan Experience,' where he can speak freely. These podcasts are perceived by the public as more authentic and accessible and reach audiences who sometimes don’t watch TV at all. Additionally, he uses the X social media platform. With Elon Musk’s statement that he sees Twitter as a free speech platform, Trump’s provocative content has an even greater reach. Trump’s 'what is not said' marketing technique Trump talks like a teenager, uses cynical and biting language, and even weaves in (subtle but deliberate) online conspiracies. If you are not familiar with the allegedly serious sex scandal involving P. Diddy, which allegedly took place at the parties he hosted, or the conspiracies linking him to celebrities like Beyoncé and Jennifer Lopez, then you're missing out on what's happening on TikTok. This marketing tactic is quite genius, like a gift from heaven to Trump. How is it that people associated with P. Diddy, who has been accused of gross misconduct, are the ones supporting Kamala? In a brilliant move, Trump encapsulated this scandal and the online conspiracies involving celebrities at P. Diddy’s parties with a single line that says it all: 'Kamala is at a dance party with Beyonce.' A good marketer knows that even what isn’t said can support your brand.

US company offers cruise for Trump's entire term in office	Villa Vie Residences puts a 4-year cruise on offer starting at $255,999 per person, visiting over 100 countries across seven continents A U.S. cruise company is offering Americans a voyage of up to four years – set to continue until after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s term in office ends. The company, Villa Vie Residences, offers customers all-inclusive tickets for $255,999 per cabin, with a double-occupancy cabin starting at $319,998. The cruise will visit 140 countries across seven continents, according to a report by Business Insider. Villa Vie Residences also offers a 'midterm choice' package – a two-year voyage priced at $150,399 for a single passenger or $187,998 for a couple. One-, two- and three-year ticket options are also available on the Odyssey, a ship that sails continuously. The ship is equipped with spa facilities and fitness programs and the tickets include meals – with free beer and wine served during lunch and dinner. Business Insider reported prior to the U.S. election that millions of Americans were considering leaving the country if Trump were re-elected. As election results began to come in, online searches for 'moving to Canada' spiked. While the Odyssey cruise doesn’t offer 'true' citizenship or immigration, it gives passengers an option to 'escape the traffic, politics and daily urban routine.' The Odyssey embarked on its maiden voyage in September after being docked in Belfast, Ireland, for four months due to delays. It was previously reported that two passengers who repeatedly complained about the delays were removed from the ship and their contracts were canceled.

Even though he was fired, Gallant's draft orders for Haredim will...	Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was fired, but the IDF is going ahead with issuing 7,000 additional draft orders to ultra-Orthodox Israeli young men, sparking controversy and protest; Only a fraction have reported for duty, highlighting tensions within Israeli society over conscription policies Former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was dismissed a week ago, but the conscription orders he planned to issue to thousands of Haredim will go on as planned, the IDF maintains. The military announced on Tuesday that, starting from Sunday, an additional 7,000 draft notices will be sent to ultra-Orthodox Jews. 'We are continuing with this process as planned. The Haredi recruitment administration is not shutting down, and all recruitment initiatives for the Haredim are under review,' according to the IDF. The IDF emphasized that the issuance of these orders has already received approval and complies with legal standard. 'We have not received any other directive,' according to the military. Last week, soon after the announcement regarding Haredi conscription, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and appointed Israel Katz as his successor. Among the 3,000 orders issued in the initial phase, only 240 young Haredi men reported to recruitment offices. Approximately 800 received warnings of impending arrest for failing to attend the initial draft process, despite multiple notifications. The 3,000 notices were sent out in three waves, each consisting of 1,000 orders: 50% targeted those age 18-21, 40% targeted the 22-23 age group, and 10% were aimed at those age 24-25. Some 15% of these are married. Of those notified, less than a tenth, or around 240, have responded, with some having already completed the enlistment process. The IDF currently estimates a deficit of approximately 10,000 active-duty soldiers needed to meet force-building requirements. This shortfall implies a need for personnel who can both strengthen existing forces and participate in future strategic plans. The scale of forces allocated to combat sectors is expected to be significantly larger than it was before October 7, 2023, necessitating substantial manpower. Meanwhile, Haredi political parties are advocating for any draft exemption law passed with their consent to annul previously issued conscription orders to young Haredim, sent without their coordination. They also plan to seek clemency for those who have faced sanctions or threats of arrest. Within extreme Haredi factions, protests are intensifying against efforts to expand the draft. Recently, a 'Black Flag' center was established, disseminating voice messages via kosher phones with updates on the arrival of draft enforcers in Haredi communities, and preparations for protests against them. Plans for mass rallies in support of halting the continued dispatch of draft notices are underway. A senior figure within the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party criticized the situation. 'The sending of orders by the army is directly attributed to the Likud Party and its leader. They had the opportunity to prevent the move but chose to ignore it. Moreover, Likud did not pass the draft law they committed to, opposed the day care law aimed at helping poor families, and now they are even deliberately acting against yeshiva students.

Kibbutz Nir Oz opts to rebuild 400 days after October 7 massacre	Residents, a quarter of which were either murdered or kidnapped during the Hamas atrocities say the chose to rebuild their community; Netanyahu has not visited since the massacre, Smotrich expected to visit on Tuesday After more than 400 days since the Hamas massacre on October 7 last year, residents of Kibbutz Nir Oz voted to rebuild their community. 'Out of the unimaginable pain of what we have gone through and are still going through, and while calling on the government to immediately return all the hostages as a necessary and basic condition for our revival,' they wrote in a document published on Monday. Nir Oz members said that victory for them means the return of the hostages and the reconstruction of the kibbutz. 'It is clear to us that the only victory alongside the return of our loved ones is the re-establishment of Kibbutz Nir Oz. Stronger, better, and bigger. The members of Nir Oz decided: Kibbutz Nir Oz will be rebuilt.' They said in rebuilding, Israel's resilience and ability to rise again will be tested. 'Therefore, the government must ensure a complete and optimal construction of the kibbutz, while showing generosity and a sincere desire to bring about the revival of Nir Oz. Along with the re-establishment, it is our duty to preserve the memory and heritage, and to perpetuate the stories of heroism in Kibbutz Nir Oz to ensure the memory of the place and its people for generations.' The members said that there may be those who would not be able to return because of their personal loss and trauma. 'These people are our people and are an essential part of the community. We demand that the govedrnment find solutions for those who cannot return while rebuilding the community. Our door will remain open for them to return To Nir Oz in the future if they wish. We are committed to the struggle for the liberation of our friends, along with the duty to return home and start over.' Most of the members of Nir Oz currently live in Kiryat Gat a city in the south. After October 7, Nir Oz became one of the symbols of the government's abandonment when the kibbutz was occupied by hundreds of terrorists, who slaughtered the residents without hindrance. When the IDF forces arrived at the kibbutz in the afternoon, there was no one left to save. Not a single IDF bullet was fired in Nir Oz, which was completely abandoned. The results are tragic and unimaginable: 57 murdered, of which at least 7 were kidnapped from their home alive and murdered in captivity. ⁠20 living hostages and 9 killed soldiers whose bodies are still held by Hamas. 76 were kidnapped that morning, of which 40 women and children were exchanged in the hostage deal almost a year ago. Seven bodies of the fallen soldiers were returned to Israel as part of military rescue operations. As part of Nir Oz's restoration efforts, last week the chairman of the Takuma Directorate (council responsible for rebuilding the destroyed towns due to the war) and CEO of the Prime Minister's Office, Yossi Shelley, toured the kibbutz and met with the residents. 'There was a discussion together with the community leaders, the council representatives, and the residents' representatives who presented their needs and the rehabilitation plan, which they will soon approve,' said the Takuma Directorate. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich is expected to visit the kibbutz on Tuesday, 402 days after the massacre.

Mossad confirms concrete intel of plot to attack Israelis in Ko P...	Thai police bolsters forces in island amid reports of planned attack during full moon party, a favorite of visiting Israelis; security council issues travel warning, calls to avoid Israeli markings and crowded gatherings throughout Thailand Mossad confirmed on Tuesday that there was an immediate and credible threat of a plot to attack Israelis during the full moon party at Ko Pha Ngan on Friday. Ynet learned earlier that Thailand police warned in an internal brief, of the planned attack on Israeli tourists on the island. Thai police increased their activity on the island and set up roadblocks. Officials involved in the matter said that there is concrete information of the plan to target the estimated tens of thousands of Israeli visitors. An Israeli security official, said the matter is familiar to authorities here and they are in contact with their counterparts in Thailand. He also said a travel warning will be issued by the National Security Council in the near future. Ko Pha Ngan is known not only for its beautiful beaches but also for its full moon parties that carry on through the night. 'From my experience, Israelis are rattled easily,' said Erez Rot, a travel agent based in Ko Samui, another thai island. 'But maybe this year, certainly after the attacks in Amsterdam, Israelis should avoid crowded gatherings.' He said that since the outbreak of war, tourism in Thailand had taken a hit and fewer Israelis travel there. Concerns of an attack come weeks after a specific warning was issued to Israelis visiting Sri Lanka, who were told to leave the Arugam Bay area because a hit squad was believed to be in the area. Three suspects were later arrested and according to court filings in the U.S., Iran was behind a plot to target the Israelis there.

Iran builds 'defensive tunnel' in capital after Israeli strikes	Tunnel located near Tehran center will link a station on the metro line to the Imam Khomeini hospital, allowing underground access Iran is building a 'defensive tunnel' in the capital Tehran, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on Tuesday, following strikes by Israel on targets in the country. The tunnel, located near the city center, will link a station on the Tehran metro to the Imam Khomeini hospital, thus allowing direct underground access to the medical facility. 'For the first time in the country, a tunnel with defensive applications is being built in Tehran,' the head of transport for Tehran City Council told Tasnim. Last month, Israel carried out its first officially-recognized strikes in Iran, hitting missile factories and other sites near Tehran and in the country's west, as a response to Iran's October 1 attack on Israeli territory. Back in October, Iran launched nearly 200 missiles at Israel, most of which were intercepted, though some landed in central and southern Israel. Israeli officials vowed a severe response to the large-scale attack, while Iran continued issuing threats. A video was released showing Revolutionary Guard Commander Hossein Salami ordering the operation, dubbed 'Operation True Promise 2,' following a similar attack in April of the same name.

Israel seizes millions from PA after Nova victims appeal to court	Victims' families claim the Palestinian Authority's funding of terrorist actions directly harmed them and their loved ones on October 7 while seeking compensation The Jerusalem District Court on Monday granted the request of 11 families of victims of the Nova Music Festival massacre executed by Hamas on October 7, issuing a temporary attachment order of up to NIS 169 million ($42.8 million) against the Palestinian Authority (PA). This means that should the families win their lawsuit against the PA for NIS 334 million ($84.7 million), the amount would be allocated for their compensation. The appeal, filed by attorneys Tzvi A. Shamir and Gilead Sher, argued that the victims named in the lawsuit were among those attending the Nova festival and were murdered by terrorists. It included a victim who was present at Nova and was injured. The attachment request claimed, 'The Palestinian Authority, which has transferred and continues to transfer funds as rewards and compensation to terrorists and their families under PA legislation, thereby supports the terror acts committed by the terrorists in the massacre. Hence, the PA bears liability for damages to terror victims and their families.' The request further argued that Israel’s law for compensating terror victims provides the petitioners with a solid basis for a claim against the PA and allows for a direct civil lawsuit against any entity involved in a terror act. The law allows exemplary compensation of NIS 10 million ($2.5 million) to the families of those killed in terror attacks and NIS 5 million ($1.25 million) to those left disabled, in addition to compensation for damages and other stipends. The request also added that, according to the Compensation of Victims of Terrorism Bill, a 'terror-supporting body' is defined as any entity that transfers funds due to a terror attack for the benefit of the perpetrator or on their behalf. Last September, the Jerusalem District Court issued an attachment order of NIS 160 million ($40.6 million) on funds designated for the Palestinian Authority at the appeal of dozens of other bereaved families, including families who lost loved ones in the past year, represented by attorneys Barak Kedem and Arie Arbus. The families were those whose relatives were murdered in recent years’ attacks, including terrorist infiltrations, suicide bombings in major cities and the events of October 7, including the Nova festival massacre. The funds were seized under the 2018 Law on Freezing Revenues Designated for the Palestinian Authority which includes the Payments to Prisoners and Families of Terrorism Offenders clause. According to the 2018 law, Israel’s defense minister submits a report to the Security Cabinet at the end of each year detailing the total amount paid by the Palestinian Authority's Martyrs Fund to terrorists and their families in the previous year. The following year, an amount equal to 1/12 of the reported sum is frozen from the tax revenues Israel transfers to the PA each month. Currently, NIS 2 billion ($532 million) is frozen in the state's treasury due to this law. The court has now decided to seize money from the fund and allocate it to the plaintiffs who sued the Palestinian Authority.

Drone crashes on pre-school in Haifa Suburb, no injuries reported	Kindergarten staff rushes children into shelters as a practice when sirens in nearby areas warn of a threat; the kids were taken to safety before the UAV hit; 'the staff saved lives,' a grateful father says An attack drone launched by Hezbollah in Lebanon crashed into the yard of a preschool in the Haifa suburb of Nesher on Tuesday, while the children were inside. No one was hurt. No sirens were activated in the area of the preschool although the drone was observed crossing the border from Lebanon and was being chased by the IDF as warning sirens sounded along its way. The military said it was investigating why the Nesher sirens were not heard. A father of a 4.5-year-old girl attending the kindergarten praised the staff for its conduct after they rushed the kids into shelters on their own initiative and said their actions saved lives. 'Whenever there are sirens nearby the staff takes the children into the shelter. The teacher sent a message to the parents' group telling us the kids were fine with pictures of them in the shelter, even before the drone hit.' Repeated attempts to shoot down the drone, failed in the 14 minutes of flight as it approached the area of Haifa. Similar attacks have taken place in the recent days and the threat of drone strikes has become one of the more complex for aerial defenses. Drones are used by pro-Iran militias in Iraq and Syria and by the Houthi rebels in Yemen, as well as Hezbollah. According to the Air Force, some 1,300 attack drones were launched at Israel since the start of the war. 231 hit the ground. This means some 82% of the hostile UAVs have been successfully shot down. The IDF has been trying to target the Hezbollah's secretive 127 Unit responsible for launching attack drones areas from where the drones, even after its commander was assassinated in the attack on the Dahieh last September. Only 10% of the unit's force has been killed thus far, the military said adding that the terror group still retains some 30% of its drone arsenal after most was destroyed in IDF attacks on warehouses and launchers.
