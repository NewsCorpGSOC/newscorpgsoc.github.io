Inside Assad’s escape: How russian agents smuggled him out of Syr...	Deposed Syrian dictator instructed to board private jet, disable transponder and land at Russian air base near Latakia before continuing to Moscow; while Putin approved operation, he reportedly has no plans to meet with Assad Russian intelligence agents orchestrated Bashar Assad's escape from Syria as rebels closed in on Damascus, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, citing three sources familiar with the matter. Assad was instructed to board his private jet without informing anyone and to disable the plane’s transponder, the sources said. He landed at the Russian Khmeimim Airbase near Latakia before continuing to Moscow, likely aboard a Russian military aircraft. According to the report, Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the operation to rescue the Syrian dictator but has no plans to meet with him now that he is in exile in Russia. According to Bloomberg, Russian agents urged Assad to leave Syria once it became evident he would lose the battle against rebel forces. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov confirmed over the weekend that Assad was evacuated from Syria 'in the safest possible way.' During the escape early Sunday, Assad’s plane disappeared from radar, sparking concerns it might have crashed. The aircraft had been observed heading west toward the Mediterranean coast before making a U-turn and vanishing from tracking maps.

However, no photographs or videos of Assad in Russia have surfaced since his reported arrival. According to the UK’s Daily Mail, the Assad family owns at least 20 apartments in Moscow, valued at close to $40 million. Assad’s uncle, Mohammed Makhlouf, purchased 18 luxury apartments in an exclusive development in the Russian capital, home to government officials, business leaders and other affluent Russians. Assad and his family may reside in one of these apartments, although Russian authorities could provide alternative accommodations for security reasons. Although the Assad family has never lived in Moscow, they are familiar with the city. Bashar Assad’s father, Hafez Assad, visited frequently for meetings with Putin and other senior Russian officials. Additionally, Assad’s eldest son studied at a university in Moscow, writing his thesis in Russian, and Asma Assad attended his graduation ceremony. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyotzfwekl	2024-12-11T14:21:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/25/r1fi3qJYC/r1fi3qJYC_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

US-backed, Erdogan’s rivals and tied to Israel: Who are Syria’s K...	Despite Assad’s fall, Syria rife with militias and terror groups clashing over opposing interests; US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), Kurdish-led group active for 9 years, fight ISIS and Turkish-backed rebels while seeing Israel as a model The regime of dictator Bashar Assad has been toppled, and the former president has fled to Russia, where he has been granted political asylum. However, the fighting in Syria shows no signs of abating, as various factions with opposing interests continue to battle across the country. Overnight Wednesday, reports emerged that the Kurdish rebel forces, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), reached a cease-fire agreement with Turkey-backed rebels near the city of Manbij. The truce was brokered by the United States. The SDF commander confirmed the agreement to Reuters, just days after the Kurdish rebels announced they had shifted to a defensive posture against 'Turkish occupation and its mercenaries.' Among the many groups currently fighting in Syria, here’s what is known about the Syrian Democratic Forces. US-backed Kurds fighting ISIS: A decade of the SDF In October 2024, the SDF celebrated nine years since its founding. The alliance was established in the midst of the Syrian Civil War in the fall of 2015, in the city of Qamishli, located in Syria’s northeastern Al-Hasakah province, a predominantly Kurdish border region. This area also became the SDF’s main theater of operations during the civil war. According to a recent BBC Arabic report, the SDF has enjoyed U.S. support since its inception, having been created to serve as a local partner for the international coalition fighting ISIS. When the SDF was launched, it described itself as a 'national military bloc' representing all Syrians, including but not limited to the Kurdish minority. Its primary goal was to defeat ISIS and reclaim all territories seized by the terror group. Backed by financial and military aid from the coalition, the SDF made significant gains on the battlefield. However, as the Syrian Civil War progressed, Turkey—Syria’s northern neighbor—viewed the SDF’s armed structure, its concentration in northeastern Syria and its successes with increasing hostility. Against this backdrop of Pentagon support and U.S. activity in parts of Syria, CNN reported on Wednesday that SDF forces mistakenly shot down an American MQ-9 Reaper drone in northern Syria. According to several U.S. officials, the Kurdish fighters believed the drone was Turkish and deemed it a threat. CNN noted that a single MQ-9 drone costs around $30 million. The conflict with Turkey and Trump’s abandonment The SDF succeeded in driving ISIS out of several strategic areas and took control of large swathes of northeastern Syria. Although ISIS was declared defeated in 2019, the victory did little to secure the Kurdish forces, who feared displacement or annihilation. Their concerns grew following then-U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw most American troops—a move the Kurds viewed as abandonment. The U.S. alliance with the SDF had long been a point of contention between Washington and NATO allies, particularly Turkey. Ankara, a NATO member, opposes the Syrian Democratic Forces and Kurdish aspirations along the borders with Syria and Iraq. Turkey vehemently criticized U.S. support for the SDF and repeatedly launched operations against the group. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: But Turkey wasn’t the only challenge for the SDF. The Syrian regime also opposed the Kurds’ 2016 declaration of a federal system in the areas under their control. According to a BBC report, Turkey’s attacks on the SDF escalated following the outbreak of the Gaza war last year. Ankara views the SDF as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a group Turkey designates as a terrorist organization. Turkey has waged a decades-long war against the PKK, resulting in significant casualties. Just this October, tensions between Turkey and the Kurds flared again after the headquarters of the Turkish Aerospace Industries (TUSAS) in Ankara was bombed. Even before the PKK claimed responsibility, Turkey launched a wave of intense air and ground strikes against the Kurds in Syria and Iraq, reportedly targeting SDF positions. In addition to Turkey's hostilities, the SDF faced clashes with Arab tribes in Syria’s Deir ez-Zor region, with a second wave of fighting breaking out in August 2023 following earlier clashes in September. Pro-Iranian groups have also attacked SDF positions, adding to the challenges faced by the Kurdish-led alliance. Challenges for the SDF and its ties with Israel The main adversaries of the SDF are jihadist groups involved in the Syrian war, particularly ISIS, Turkey-backed Syrian opposition groups and factions linked to al-Qaeda. However, the SDF faces additional challenges. Opinions are divided regarding the SDF’s exact composition. Some argue that the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) make up the vast majority of SDF fighters and form the backbone of the organization. Other reports suggest that the number of Arab fighters has increased as the SDF advanced into Arab-majority territories. According to the Pentagon, in March 2016, the SDF comprised 40% Kurds and 60% Arabs. Other sources claim a lower percentage of Arab fighters, but there is consensus that Kurdish leadership dominates the group. The SDF is made up of several armed factions with varying compositions, including the Sanadid Forces, the Syrian Christian Military Council, the Army of Rebels and the YPJ, an all-female militia. These groups have also been active in the Syrian Civil War, striving to protect the independence of Syrian Kurdistan and resisting the Assad regime’s attempts to annex the region. The SDF’s commander, Mazloum Abdi, whose real name is Ferhad Abdi Şahin, was born in Kobani, Aleppo province, Syria. According to a recent BBC report, Abdi recently congratulated Donald Trump on his election victory but had previously criticized U.S. policy toward Syria during Trump’s first administration. Announcing a cease-fire agreement with Turkish-backed Syrian opposition forces, Abdi said, 'Our goal is to cease fire throughout Syria and enter into a political process for the future of the country.' The Kurds’ strong ties with Israel are well-documented, and the SDF views Israel as a model. Speaking at a press briefing on Monday about recent Israeli strikes on various targets in Syria intended to prevent those assets from falling into extremist hands, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar confirmed that Israel maintains contact with the Kurds in the country. Over the years, the Kurds have also fought against the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) militia, led by Abu Mohammed al-Golani. Al-Golani, who had spearheaded efforts to topple Assad in what has been termed 'Deterrence of Aggression,' recently sent messages advocating for 'avoiding sectarian violence and building a new Syria for all.' However, given Syria’s fragmentation, only time will tell if these optimistic messages are genuine and achievable, or if the country will once again spiral into complex internal warfare driven by competing interests. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj8jtudnkg	2024-12-11T12:24:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/BJ00xnHw4ke/BJ00xnHw4ke_0_192_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Syrian refugees in Europe fear being forced home after Assad's fa...	As European nations reassess asylum policies for Syrians following fall of Assad regime, many fear being forced to return despite rebuilding their lives abroad Najem al-Moussa was delighted when news of Syrian President Bashar Assad's overthrow first beamed from the television in his tiny Athens apartment. Then came a dreaded thought: what if Assad's fall meant he and his family would be forced to return to the devastated country they had fled nine years before? Events in Syria took a seismic turn on Sunday when rebels poured into Damascus after a lightning offensive that forced Assad into exile in Russia and raised hopes of an end to a 13-year civil war that has left the country in ruins. Now, as European countries rethink their asylum policies for Syrians in the light of developments, many fear they will have to go back. 'I consider my life to be here. Not just me but my children,' said al-Moussa, a lawyer by training who works as a cook in Athens and has been transfixed by the television news for days. 'The life that was provided in Greece, my country was not able to offer.' Hundreds of thousands of people have died in Syria's war, which began in 2011 and pitted Assad's army against various rebel groups. Whole cities have been flattened by bombing. Millions fled or are in need of humanitarian assistance. Thousands of civilians who moved to neighbouring Turkey and Lebanon rushed back into Syria this week, their cars filled with people, luggage, and hope of a peaceful homecoming. But 10 Syrian refugees who spoke to Reuters in Europe and the United Kingdom thought differently. Returning would mean an end to a new life they have risked everything to build. Al-Moussa and his wife Bushra al-Bukaai fled Damascus in 2015 after the birth of their second child. They spent everything they had on a two-year journey that took them to Sudan, Iran, Turkey and eventually Greece. They now have five children who are all in school and speak fluent Greek. None speak the Arabic of their parents' homeland. 'When we talk, they ask: 'Daddy, can we really go back to living in these areas? How did you live there before?,'' Al-Moussa said. His wife agrees. 'I cannot imagine my children building their future in Syria. Not at all,' she said, their youngest son in her lap. Joy and despair First-time asylum applications by Syrians to the EU were highest in 2015 and 2016 - more than 330,000 in each of those years - before dropping off significantly in the next three years, EU data show. But applications trebled between 2020 and 2023 after a devastating earthquake and as violence and economic hardship persisted. Thousands of those applications are now on hold after several European countries including Greece this week suspended asylum applications from Syrians while they consider whether Syria is safer now that Assad has gone. It is not clear if asylum seekers will be forced home. ProAsyl, a German NGO providing legal help to asylum seekers, said cases would be in limbo until the foreign ministry publishes its updated security assessment report on Syria, which could take months. ProAsyl spokesperson Tareq Alaows told Reuters the decision could face legal challenges as authorities in Europe must decide on asylum applications within three to six months of their submission. Still, Al-Moussa's Greek residence permit is up for renewal and he is worried. He is not alone. Syrian vet Hasan Alzagher was in a German language class in the city of Erfurt on Monday when he heard that his asylum application for Germany, which he hoped would be finalized by the end of the year, was put on hold. 'This is mentally devastating. It's difficult that after you set your mind to live here, build a new life here, learn the language and integrate in this country, you now have to return to your homeland where basic necessities are still missing,' he told Reuters by phone. In fear of being recruited into the army or a militia group, Alzagher, 32, said he fled the city of Raqqa in 2018. He spent time in Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey before heading to Germany in 2023. 'The fall of Assad is a huge joy for all Syrians, but we who came here and went into debt to finance this journey, every time we arrive in a new place, we have to start over again. It's difficult to think about returning to Syria now.' Alzagher's worries were echoed by Syrians in the United Kingdom, which has also paused decisions on asylum claims.

Nahhas, 34, from Aleppo, said he was a wanted man in Syria after participating in an anti-government protest there. His grandfather was jailed for 13 years and many of his friends have been detained and tortured, he said. He has been granted asylum in the UK, but is nervous now, especially as his wife is pregnant. The 'possibility that they (UK authorities) could blindly reverse some decisions without any personal circumstances being factored in' was worrying, he said by phone. 'It's a whirlwind of thoughts, uncertainties and unnecessary additional concerns in our lives.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skuwgpvnjg	2024-12-11T10:44:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/B1CtDPPNJe/B1CtDPPNJe_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

IDF in Syria: Seven villages, two brigades and winter preparation...	Without resistance, IDF forces took control of Syrian outposts, confiscating tanks, missiles and equipment; preparing for a prolonged stay, troops received living containers; local villagers maintain daily life as army awaits stable governing entity In a historic move on the Syrian Golan Heights, IDF forces have completed the capture of five key sectors in the buffer zone beyond the border with Syria. Over the past two days, thousands of residents from seven local villages have effectively come under the protection of IDF troops from the Paratroopers Brigade, the 188th Armored Brigade, the 7th Armored Brigade and the Commando Brigade. The weekend operation, which involved seizing outposts and positions, was conducted without resistance. Syrian soldiers abandoned their security posts facing Israel, retreating eastward on trucks and not returning. Armed rebels, reportedly from the Daraa area and unaffiliated with the extremist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), alerted some Syrian troops about the IDF's advance. In some instances, these rebels looted a UN post, though Israeli forces later mediated to ensure the stolen weapons and equipment were returned to UNDOF observers, who remain in the area but hold little practical influence. The long-standing 1974 ceasefire agreement between Israel and Syria under former autocrat Hafez Assad is now effectively obsolete, as a new, undefined political entity has taken power in Damascus, unrecognized by the international community. In response, the IDF is preparing for an extended presence in Syrian territory, roughly five to seven kilometers beyond the international border, until a stable governing authority assumes control of the region and renews or renegotiates the longstanding accord between Jerusalem and Damascus. The decision is driven by a determination to avoid a scenario where the border mirrors the volatile conditions seen along the Gaza Strip and Lebanon prior to October 7, with armed terror groups operating near Israeli communities. To bolster security, the IDF is racing to complete engineering defenses in the area. Approximately 15 kilometers (10 miles) of a new barrier have been constructed along the international border, known as the 'barrel line,' located one to two kilometers east of Israel’s existing security fence. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The barrier includes deep trenches to block the advance of light vehicles such as pickup trucks, elevated earth embankments and the reinforcement of minefields. These measures complement the high-tech security fence built over the past decade along the 80-kilometer (50-mile) stretch from Hamat Gader to Mount Hermon. 'Not much was invested in these outposts' IDF troops seized Syrian army outposts after soldiers hastily abandoned their bases, boarding trucks and fleeing east. 'We found a few outdated tanks and anti-tank missiles we confiscated, rusty infrastructure and documents translating data about our forces for their troops,' an IDF commander described. 'It seems not much was invested in these outposts.' The commander noted that the IDF has already provided its soldiers with comfortable living containers, explaining, 'It's unpleasant to sleep in these Syrian bunkers. We've also brought in a generator and are clearing paths from Israeli territory ahead of the coming snow. Any potential threat will remain far from Israeli communities.' Meanwhile, forces from the elite Shaldag Unit completed an operation on the Syrian Mount Hermon, during which they confiscated explosives, mines, anti-tank missiles and other military equipment. According to soldiers, Syrian villagers welcomed the IDF presence. 'They didn’t throw rice or sweets, but many expressed relief at the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime. They remember the aid we provided during the last decade of civil war,' one soldier shared. Life in the villages continues as usual, with locals openly conversing with Israeli troops, cultivating their land and tending livestock, no longer fearful of Assad’s soldiers. The IDF troops, now settling into the area, describe a relatively calm environment. They walk without helmets, have decent phone reception and remain in high spirits. One soldier, a sniper from the 101st Battalion, observed from a fortified position previously held by a Syrian soldier. 'I know this isn’t Gaza or Lebanon; it’s something completely different,' he remarked. Despite the unfamiliarity, most commanders—except for 210th Division Commander Brig. Gen. Yair Paley and perhaps the brigade commanders—had not trained for such operations, as the IDF discontinued Syrian outpost drills in the early 2000s. However, the army is making active efforts to establish good relations with the local population, even if temporary. Positive messages have already been sent to the governor of the region based in Khan Arnabah near Quneitra. 'We were prepared for Shiite jihadists from the pro-Iranian militias deeper in Syria, and now we’re preparing for Sunni jihadists. Both have similar pickup trucks, weapons and extremist ideologies,' IDF officials explained. 'The Syrian villages here are trying to make sense of the situation. They just want peace and a livelihood.' Soldiers have been instructed to prepare for at least a year-long presence or until further decisions are made at the political level. Brig. Gen. Paley, who commands the 210th Division overseeing the sector, emphasized: 'We will continue to monitor and defend against any threat. Our mission is clear: to protect the citizens of Israel and the Golan.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1qhiiw4jx	2024-12-11T09:37:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/HJcpIHDN1g/HJcpIHDN1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Syrian rebels torch tomb of Hafez Assad in act of 'vengeance'	Family mausoleum in Latakia province, a stronghold of the Alawite Muslim sect, served as a pilgrimage site during Bashar Assad's rule over Syria Opponents of ousted Syrian leader Bashar Assad set fire to the mausoleum of his father and former dictator, Hafez Assad, in the town of Qardaha, the French AFP news agency reported Wednesday. The report followed the circulation of online videos showing the site engulfed in flames, while a rebel waved the Syrian opposition flag and shouted without visible joy. A rebel-affiliated news outlet claimed the act was carried out as 'vengeance' for the thousands of victims attributed to the Assad regime.

How is Israel merging tech and biology to tackle climate change?	Shai Melcer: 'Bioconvergence is the world in which biology meets other technologies from the world of engineering—both hardware and software' Bioconvergence is a cutting-edge field that spans diverse markets, from healthcare and food to agriculture and sustainability. In Israel, the National Bioconvergence Program is revolutionizing the industry by addressing every aspect of its ecosystem. The program promotes investments in bioconvergence companies, builds essential research infrastructure, develops skilled human capital, and tackles regulatory challenges to pave the way for innovation and growth. 'Bioconvergence is the world in which biology meets other technologies from the world of engineering—both hardware and software,' explained Shai Melcer, head of the National Bioconvergence Program in Israel. 'It’s where high-tech meets biotech, and they both enrich each other’s worlds.' In addressing the global climate crisis, bioconvergence offers groundbreaking solutions. By combining biological components with advanced hardware and software, this field enables more accurate climate monitoring and innovative strategies to tackle challenges on both local and global scales. A prime example is BugEra, a pioneering Israeli company that uses advanced genetic engineering to create novel strains of black soldier flies (BSF) that significantly boost oil production. By breaking down economic barriers in BSF farming, BugEra produces sustainable oils that can replace traditional food oils and biofuels. Their process also upcycles diverse organic waste, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fuel and waste while advancing the circular economy. 'This helps Israel overcome some of its food security challenges by becoming self-sufficient in producing its own protein for animal feed and agriculture,' said Yoav Etgar, co-founder and CEO of BugEra. 'This industry will lead to actually using black soldier flies as a bioconverter of Israel's organic waste into alternative protein, alternative oil for feed, animal feed, agriculture feed, and biofuel, and by that, to promote Israel's self-sufficient capabilities.' Another innovative company is Biotic, which produces fully bio-based, biodegradable PHBV polymers using marine biomass as feedstock in its precision fermentation process. These polymers aim to replace fossil-based plastics, eliminating the need for traditional recycling. Unlike most bioplastics—which rely on terrestrial resources, fresh or treated water, and industrial composting—Biotic offers a cost-effective, scalable solution. Currently, bioplastics meet less than 2% of global demand and cost at least three times more than fossil-based plastics. Biotic is breaking this mold, paving the way for sustainable, accessible alternatives to traditional plastics. 'If we take something nature knows how to do and do it naturally, and are just emphasizing it and scaling it up, in this way we are not harming nature but rather helping it recreate itself,' said Adi Goldman, co-founder and CEO of Biotic. Melcer added: 'Israel has a good, strong record in the high-tech industry and top-notch biological research in all fields. Putting these two together gives you a robust approach to the tech requirements of dealing with climate change.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkgfg4p41x	2024-12-11T06:45:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/ryvd7VPVkg/ryvd7VPVkg_1_27_623_351_0_small.jpg
You're responsible for your territory': Israel’s direct messages...	Arab outlet publishes files found following Assad's fall and detailing alleged messages sent by agent who warned regime of cooperation with Iran and Hezbollah Arabic-language outlet Sky News Arabia reported on Wednesday that documents discovered following the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad indicate messages were sent directly from Israel to Syria concerning Iran's presence, its proxy organizations in the country and arms smuggling operations executed by Tehran to bolster these groups. The report is based on documents published on social media whose authenticity remains uncertain. However, the documents bear Syria's state emblem under Assad and appear to have been authored by military top brass. According to the documents, an agent named 'Mussa' or 'Moses' conveyed messages directly to former Syrian Defense Minister Ali Mahmoud Abbas and passed on to Assad's former national security advisor Ali Mamlouk. Israel reportedly expressed discontent on several occasions over Syria's approval of Hezbollah or Iranian activities on its soil. The agent detailed these incidents in his messages. On April 8, 2023, according to the documents and report, the agent warned that Hamas had launched rockets against Israel from the Golan Heights. 'Three rockets were launched from the Golan under Khaled Mashal's command. 'We demand you stop these incidents — or consequences will follow. You are responsible for what happens on your territory,' he wrote. 'Our last step was a warning shot. If you don't curb these actions, the next attack will be far more severe. You’ll pay an unprecedented price.' Warnings continued on May 7, 2023, when Israel allegedly struck Hezbollah-linked weapons depots. 'We won’t allow the presence of Haj Hashim or his soldiers in southern Syria,' the agent wrote, referring to Musa Ali Daqduq, also known as Abu Hussein Sajid, who was reportedly killed in an Israeli strike. The documents revealed additional warnings. On May 17, 2023, eight aircraft reportedly landed at Khmeimim Air Base — four Iranian and four Syrian planes. They allegedly delivered weapons to depots in Latakia and Qutayfah. 'The Russian mechanism allows you to operate without risking an Israeli response. However, supporting Iran and Hezbollah will compel us to act with severity. Any unmonitored activity bypassing Russian oversight will be seen as a direct threat to Israel and prompt a response,' the agent warned. In another warning on July 14, 2023, Moses wrote that Israel was dissatisfied with the cooperation between Iran and Hezbollah. 'Supporting Hezbollah’s air defense capabilities is an act against Israel. It serves Hezbollah’s interests alone and harms your army.' Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed on Wednesday that Israel's actions in Syria violate the 1974 disengagement agreement signed after the Yom Kippur War. She called Israel's airstrikes in Syria 'very concerning' and called for restraint to avoid escalating tensions. Last week, Reuters reported that the U.S. and UAE discussed a plan in recent months to ease harsh U.S. sanctions on the Assad regime and provide financial aid from the UAE and Saudi Arabia on the condition he distanced himself from the Iranian axis and prevented weapon deliveries to Hezbollah through Syrian territory. According to sources familiar with the discussions, the rebels’ success demonstrates a 'weakness' in the Iranian axis, which Washington and Abu Dhabi hoped to exploit to drive a wedge between Assad and Tehran. Last month, the Lebanese newspaper Aljoumhouria, affiliated with Hezbollah opponents, reported that Israel had proposed lifting sanctions on Assad if he permanently closed the Syria-Lebanon border to Hezbollah weapons smuggling from various sources. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The outlet claimed the proposal was raised by Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and aimed to secure Russia's guarantee to prevent weapons smuggling between Syria and Lebanon, aiming for Moscow to work with Assad to control the border and close the 'Iranian highway' connecting Beirut's Dahieh district—a Hezbollah stronghold—to Iran via Baghdad and Damascus. Sources claimed that Dermer promised in return to ask the U.S. administration to freeze sanctions imposed on Assad and remove Syrian and Russian companies from sanctions lists. The idea had been previously proposed during U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's time in office and may have resurfaced following his re-election. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1q000bw4ye	2024-12-11T06:44:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/rJN9sxPEye/rJN9sxPEye_0_0_853_480_0_small.jpg

European pilots fear flying over Middle East	Growing safety concerns in the European air industry due to escalating tensions in the Middle East following Hamas' attack on Israel in October 2023 and the war in Gaza; 'No one should be forced to work in such a hazardous environment' In late September, an experienced pilot at low-cost European airline Wizz Air felt anxious after learning his plane would fly over Iraq at night amid mounting tensions between nearby Iran and Israel. He decided to query the decision since just a week earlier the airline had deemed the route unsafe. In response, Wizz Air's flight operations team told him the airway was now considered secure and he had to fly it, without giving further explanation, the pilot said. 'I wasn't really happy with it,' the pilot, who requested anonymity from fear he could lose his job, told Reuters. Days later, Iraq closed its airspace when Iran fired missiles on Oct. 1 at Israel. 'It confirmed my suspicion that it wasn't safe.' In response to Reuters' queries, Wizz Air said safety of crew and passengers is its utmost priority and would not be compromised 'in any circumstances', adding its decisions on where to fly are based on stringent risk assessments in collaboration with third party intelligence specialists. 'Our aircraft and crews will only fly in airspace that has been deemed safe and we would never take any risks in this respect,' Wizz Air also said in a statement. Reuters spoke to four pilots, three cabin crew members, three flight security experts and two airline executives about growing safety concerns in the European air industry due to escalating tensions in the Middle East following Hamas' attack on Israel in October 2023 and the start of the war in Gaza. The Middle East is a key air corridor for planes heading to India, South-East Asia and Australia and last year was criss-crossed daily by 1,400 flights to and from Europe, Eurocontrol data show. The safety debate about flying over the region is playing out in Europe largely because pilots there are protected by unions, unlike other parts of the world. Reuters reviewed nine unpublished letters from four European unions representing pilots and crews that expressed worries about air safety over Middle Eastern countries. The letters were sent to Wizz Air, Ryanair, airBaltic, the European Commission and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) between June and August. 'No one should be forced to work in such a hazardous environment and no commercial interests should outweigh the safety and well-being of those on board,' read a letter, addressed to EASA and the European Commission from Romanian flight crew union FPU Romania, dated Aug. 26. In other letters, staff called on airlines to be more transparent about their decisions on routes and demanded the right to refuse to fly a dangerous route. There have been no fatalities or accidents impacting commercial aviation tied to the escalation of tensions in the Middle East since the war in Gaza erupted last year. Air France opened an internal investigation after one of its commercial planes flew over Iraq on Oct. 1 during Tehran's missile attack on Israel. On that occasion, airlines scrambled to divert dozens of planes heading towards the affected areas in the Middle East. The ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran and the abrupt ousting of President Bashar al-Assad by Syrian rebels at the weekend have raised concerns of further insecurity in the region. The use of missiles in the region has revived memories of the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014 and of Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 en route from Tehran in 2020. Being accidentally shot-down in the chaos of war is the top worry, three pilots and two aviation safety experts told Reuters, along with the risk of an emergency landing. While airlines including Lufthansa and KLM no longer fly over Iran, carriers including Etihad, flydubai, Aeroflot and Wizz Air were still crossing the country's airspace as recently as Dec. 2, data from tracking service FlightRadar24 show. Some European airlines including Lufthansa and KLM allow crew to opt-out of routes they don't feel are safe, but others such as Wizz Air, Ryanair and airBaltic don't. AirBaltic CEO Martin Gauss said his airline meets an international safety standard that doesn't need to be adjusted. 'If we start a right of refusal, then where do we stop? [When] the next person feels unhappy overflying Iraqi airspace because there's tension there?' he told Reuters on Dec. 2 in response to queries about airBaltic flight safety talks with unions. Ryanair, which intermittently flew to Jordan and Israel until September, said it makes security decisions based on EASA guidance. 'If EASA says it's safe, then, frankly, thank you, we're not interested in what the unions or some pilot think,' Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told Reuters in October, when asked about staff security concerns. EASA said it has been involved in a number of exchanges with pilots and airlines on route safety in recent months concerning the Middle East, adding that disciplining staff for raising safety concerns would run counter to a 'just culture' where employees can voice worries. Reassurances are not enough One Abu Dhabi-based Wizz Air pilot told Reuters he was comfortable flying over the conflict-torn region as he believes the industry has a very high safety standard. But for some pilots and crew members working at budget airlines, the reassurances of the companies are insufficient. They told Reuters pilots should have more choice in refusing flights over potentially dangerous airspace and requested more information about airline security assessments. 'The fact that Wizz Air sends emails asserting that it's safe is irrelevant to commercial employees,' read a letter from FPU Romania to Chief Operating Officer Diarmuid O'Conghaile, dated Aug. 12. 'Flights into these conflict areas, even if they are rescue missions, should be carried out by military personnel and aircraft, not by commercial crews.' Mircea Constantin, a former cabin crew member who represents FPU Romania, said Wizz Air never gave a formal response to this letter and similar ones sent earlier this year, but did send security guidance and updates to staff. A pilot and a cabin crew member, who declined to be named for fear of retaliatory action, said they got warnings from their employers for refusing to fly on Middle Eastern routes or calling in sick. Congested skies over the Middle East Last month, 165 missiles were launched in Middle Eastern conflict zones versus just 33 in November 2023, according to the latest available data from Osprey Flight Solutions. But airspace can only be enforcedly restricted if a country chooses to shut it down, as in the case of Ukraine after Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. Several airlines have opted to briefly suspend flights to places like Israel when tension rises. Lufthansa and British Airways did so after Iran bombarded Israel on April 13. But this limits the airspace in use in the already congested Middle Eastern skies. Choosing to fly over Central Asia or Egypt and Saudi Arabia to avoid Middle Eastern hot spots is also more costly as planes burn more fuel and some countries charge higher overflight fees. Flying a commercial plane from Singapore to London-Heathrow through Afghanistan and Central Asia, for instance, cost an airline $4,760 in overflight fees, about 50% more than a route through the Middle East, according to two Aug. 31 flight plans reviewed by Reuters. Reuters could not name the airline as the flight plans are not public. Some private jets are avoiding the most critical areas. 'At the moment, my no-go areas would be the hotspot points: Libya, Israel, Iran, simply because they're sort of caught up in it all,' said Andy Spencer, a Singapore-based pilot who flies private jets and who previously worked as an airline pilot. Spencer, who has two decades of experience and flies through the Middle East regularly, said that on a recent flight from Manila to Cuba, he flew from Dubai over Egypt and north through Malta before refueling in Morocco to circumvent Libyan and Israeli airspace. EASA, regarded by industry experts as the strictest regional safety regulator, issues public bulletins on how to fly safely over conflict zones. But these aren't mandatory and every airline decides where to travel based on a patchwork of government notices, third-party security advisors, in-house security teams and information sharing between carriers, leading to divergent policies. Such intelligence is not usually shared with staff. The opacity has sown fear and mistrust among pilots, cabin crew and passengers as they question whether their airline has missed something carriers in other countries are aware of, said Otjan de Bruijn, a former head of European pilots union the European Cockpit Association and a pilot for KLM. 'The more information you make available to pilots, the more informed a decision they can make,' said Spencer, who is also an operations specialist at flight advisory body OPSGROUP, which offers independent operational advice to the aviation industry. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: When Gulf players like Etihad, Emirates or flydubai suddenly stop flying over Iran or Iraq, the industry sees it as a reliable indicator of risk, pilots and security sources said, as these airlines can have access to detailed intelligence from their governments. Flydubai told Reuters it operates within airspace and airways in the region that are approved by Dubai's General Civil Aviation Authority. Emirates said it continuously monitors all routings, adjusting as required and would never operate a flight unless it was safe to do so. Etihad said it only operates through approved airspace. Passenger rights groups are also asking for travelers to receive more information. 'If passengers decline to take flights over conflict zones, airlines would be disinclined to continue such flights,' said Paul Hudson, the head of U.S.-based passenger group Flyers Rights. 'And passengers who take such flights would do so informed of the risks.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjpa2zvn1l	2024-12-11T05:26:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2021/01/14/H1yDx5p0w/H1yDx5p0w_0_108_885_498_0_small.jpg

Kfar Aza and surrounding communities begin massive restoration ef...	Kibbutz Kfar Aza begins its restoration journey 14 months after start of Gaza War; Backed by a $52 million government plan, efforts include rebuilding homes, upgrading infrastructure and fostering community resilience with the focus of long-term recovery Fourteen months after the tragic events of October 7, demolition and reconstruction efforts have begun in Kibbutz Kfar Aza as part of a government-funded recovery initiative led by the Tkuma Directorate. The comprehensive restoration plan includes repairs to 400 structures – 360 residential buildings and 40 public facilities – as well as infrastructure damaged during the Gaza War. Additionally, 97 buildings are slated for demolition, including 48 in the young people's neighborhood, where a final decision on their fate is still pending. The decision to rehabilitate Kfar Aza has not been without challenges, as kibbutz members struggled to reach a consensus. Ultimately, an agreement was reached, and state-funded restoration efforts are now underway. Most residents of Kfar Aza are currently living in temporary housing in Kibbutz Ruhama, while at least 100 others are staying in Kibbutz Shefayim. It remains unclear how many families will return to Kfar Aza, a place that bore the brunt of the October 7 attacks. The restoration of Kibbutz Kfar Aza is part of a broader recovery program led by the Tkuma Directorate, with an estimated total budget of $390 million The Tkuma Directorate has allocated approximately $52 million for the restoration plan, which includes demolishing and rebuilding private and kibbutz-owned homes, constructing a new young people's neighborhood in a different location, and repairing public infrastructure damaged during the war. The plan also involves creating new public facilities, establishing a new residential neighborhood, and upgrading public buildings, sports facilities and recreation centers. To manage the project, the kibbutz has partnered with the management firm A. Epstein & Sons Ltd. In recent months, the Brothers in Arms organization, along with volunteers, has already begun renovating parts of the kibbutz where homes were damaged but did not require complete demolition. However, full-scale reconstruction from the ground up is a complex task that only the government can undertake. The restoration plan for Kibbutz Kfar Aza was developed in collaboration with the kibbutz community. As part of a broader vision for recovery and independence, the Tkuma Directorate’s framework emphasizes community-led execution. This approach expands the existing compensation mechanism through the Israel Property Tax Fund, increasing it by up to 400% to address the unique circumstances and severe impact of the Gaza War on the kibbutzim and surrounding communities. Following a request from Yossi Sheli, head of the Tkuma Directorate, to Rabbi Natan Elnatan, chairman of the National Planning and Building Council, the kibbutz’s application for a permit exemption was approved. The permit allows for the construction of a neighborhood with 55 single-family homes, a new young people's zone with 60 housing units, a public building and a shared workspace. The plan also includes demolishing existing structures, relocating three portable residential units, and rebuilding 41 housing units and one public building across 29 damaged structures. Additional work includes paving roads, creating parking lots, developing open spaces, upgrading infrastructure and modifying existing buildings. Among the communities in the Tkuma region, a unique financial arrangement was developed for 10 kibbutzim, including Kfar Aza, Be’eri, Nir Oz, Nirim, Re’im, Kerem Shalom, Ein HaShlosha, Holit, Kissufim and Nahal Oz. This agreement, made between the Tkuma Directorate and the Israel Property Tax Fund in collaboration with kibbutz leadership, eliminates the need for individual claims to the tax fund. Instead, the allocated budget for restoration is comprehensive and includes settlements with the Property Tax Fund. This arrangement reduces bureaucracy and provides flexibility for the kibbutzim to tailor their recovery and rebuilding plans to the needs of their communities. The restoration of Kibbutz Kfar Aza is part of a broader recovery program led by the Tkuma Directorate, with an estimated total budget of $390 million. All the kibbutzim in the region have joined the initiative, each at various stages of planning, approval, and implementation. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'On the anniversary of the October 7 attacks and the outbreak of the Gaza War, the vast majority of the kibbutzim in the Tkuma region have begun implementing local recovery plans, despite numerous challenges,' the Tkuma Directorate stated. These challenges include the ongoing conflict, security concerns, the relocation of communities to temporary housing, debris removal, and the emotional toll and uncertainty faced by communities, some of which still have members held in captivity. 'The Tkuma Directorate will continue to work alongside the communities of the region to ensure recovery, development, and prosperity,' the statement concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/h1jzkgw4je	2024-12-11T03:54:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/rJgz5Z1vEJl/rJgz5Z1vEJl_0_0_1536_2048_0_small.jpg
The Israeli Jews who spied for Iran are biggest infiltration in d...	The arrest of almost 30 mostly Jewish citizens who allegedly spied for Iran in nine covert cells has caused alarm in the country and points to Tehran's biggest espionage effort in decades Israel's arrest of almost 30 mostly Jewish citizens who allegedly spied for Iran in nine covert cells has caused alarm in the country and points to Tehran's biggest effort in decades to infiltrate its arch-foe, four Israeli security sources said. Among the unfulfilled goals of the alleged cells was the assassination of an Israeli nuclear scientist and former military officials, while one group gathered information on military bases and air defenses, security service Shin Bet has said. Last week, the agency and Israel's police said a father and son team had passed on details of Israeli force movements including in the Golan Heights, where they lived. The arrests follow repeated efforts by Iranian intelligence operatives over the past two years to recruit ordinary Israelis to gather intelligence and carry out attacks in exchange for money, the four serving and former military and security officials said. The sources asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. 'There is a large phenomenon here,' said Shalom Ben Hanan, a former top Shin Bet official, referring to what he called the surprising number of Jewish citizens who knowingly agreed to work for Iran against the state with intelligence gathering or planning sabotage and attacks. Shin Bet and the police did not respond to requests for comment. Iran's foreign ministry did not respond to questions. In a statement sent to media after the wave of arrests, Iran’s UN mission did not confirm or deny seeking to recruit Israelis and said that 'from a logical standpoint' any such efforts by Iranian intelligence services would focus on non-Iranian and non-Muslim individuals to lessen suspicion. At least two suspects were from Israel's ultra-Orthodox community, police and the Shin Bet have said. Unlike Iranian espionage operations in previous decades that recruited a high-profile businessman and a former cabinet minister, the new alleged spies were largely people on the fringes of Israeli society, including recent immigrants, an army deserter and a convicted sex offender, conversations with the sources, court records and official statements show. Much of their activity was limited to spraying anti-Netanyahu or anti-government graffiti on walls and damaging cars, Shin Bet has said. Nonetheless, the scale of the arrests and involvement of so many Jewish Israelis, in addition to Arab citizens, has caused concern in Israel at a time it remains at war with Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza and that a cease-fire deal with Hezbollah remains fragile. Shin Bet on October 21 said the espionage activities were 'among the most severe the state of Israel has known.' The arrests also follow a wave of attempted hits and kidnappings linked to Tehran in Europe and the United States. The unusual decision to provide detailed public accounts of the alleged plots was a move by Israel's security services to signal both to Iran and potential saboteurs inside Israel that they would be caught, Ben Hanan said. 'You want to alert the public. And you also want to make an example of people that may also have intentions or plans to cooperate with the enemy,' he said. Israel has achieved major intelligence successes over the past few years in a shadow war with its regional foe, including allegedly killing a top nuclear scientist. With the recent arrests Israel has 'so far' thwarted Tehran's efforts to respond, one active military official said. Iran has been weakened by Israel's attacks on its proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the related fall of Tehran's ally, former president Bashar Assad in Syria. Social media recruits Iranian intelligence agencies often find potential recruits on social media platforms, Israeli police said in a video released in November warning of ongoing infiltration attempts. The recruiting efforts are at times direct. One message sent to an Israeli civilian and seen by Reuters promised $15,000 in exchange for information, with an email and number to call. Iran has also approached expatriate networks of Jews from Caucasus countries living in Canada and the United States, said one of the sources, a former senior official who worked on Israel's counter-espionage efforts until 2007. Israeli authorities have said publicly some of the Jewish suspects were originally from Caucasus countries. Recruited individuals are first assigned innocuous-seeming tasks in return for money, before handlers gradually demand specific intelligence on targets, including about individuals and sensitive military infrastructure, backed by the threat of blackmail, said the former official. One Israeli suspect, Vladislav Victorsson, 30, was arrested on October 14 along with his 18-year-old girlfriend in Ramat Gan. He had been jailed in 2015 for sex with minors as young as 14, according to a court indictment from that time. An acquaintance of Victorsson said he had told her he had spoken to Iranians using the Telegram messaging app. She said that Victorsson had lied to his handlers about his military experience. The acquaintance declined to be named, citing safety fears. Igal Dotan, Victorsson's lawyer, said he was representing the suspect, adding that the legal process would take time and that his client was being held in tough conditions. Dotan said he could only respond to the current case and had not defended Victorsson in earlier trials. Shin Bet and police said Victorsson knew he was working for Iranian intelligence, carrying out tasks including spraying graffiti, hiding money, posting flyers and burning cars in the Hayarkon Park in Tel Aviv for which he received over $5,000.

He recruited his girlfriend, who was tasked with recruiting homeless people to photograph demonstrations, the security services said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjysmxveje	2024-12-11T03:16:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/21/rkvv8onTC/rkvv8onTC_0_59_1000_563_0_small.jpg

Trail of 5 who attacked Maccabi Tel Aviv fan after match in Amste...	Suspects, ages 19 to 32, are accused of acts of 'violence against the public' and other crimes after Amsterdam soccer match; Two additional suspects to be held for trial later in week The trial of five suspects began on Wednesday for the lynching that took place after the soccer match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv in the UEFA Europa League, a month and three days after the pro-Palestinian assault in Amsterdam. One of the suspects, a 22-year-old, is accused of attempted murder and has been in custody since November 19 (11 days after the incident). The others, between the ages of 19 and 32, are charged with several offenses, including 'committing acts of violence against the public,' incitement to violence and spreading antisemitic messages in a WhatsApp group. According to Dutch outlet Trouw, two more suspects are expected to begin their trial on Thursday. Last week, the Amsterdam police released a photo of 12 suspects – 11 men and one woman – on television calling on them to turn themselves in. In the footage, the female suspect is seen holding a Maccabi Tel Aviv fan by the neck and others are recorded kicking other fans. The images were blurred and the police said that the suspects were involved in several incidents following the match between the two teams. Dozens of Maccabi Tel Aviv fans were attacked after their team's 5-0 loss at the Amsterdam Arena. One victim, a 30-year-old, said: 'I had just finished four months of reserve duty in Gaza and what I experienced there was no less frightening. They ran me over and pulled a knife on me. It was an ambush. I saw children being hit. We just wanted to fly home.'

Alan Dershowitz on Netanyahu trial: 'He should be allowed to be t...	Famous defense attorney tells Ynet that having a sitting prime minister sit in court is 'unrealistic' and shares his hopes for good relations between the Trump and Netanyahu administrations; 'Trump believes in peace through strength' Following Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s testimony in his alleged corruption trial on Tuesday, set to continue Wednesday afternoon, U.S. defense attorney Professor Alan Dershowitz spoke in an interview with Ynet about the consequences of an incumbent prime minister being held on trial for the first time in the country’s history. Professor Dershowitz, how realistic is it that a prime minister runs a country like Israel and at the same time testify three times a week for a month? 'It's totally unrealistic, totally illogical and this case proves beyond any doubt that the American approach is far superior to the Israeli approach. Under the American approach, if you're the president, you cannot be put on trial during the presidency.' 'Being a president is a full-time job, and no prime minister should ever be put to the choice of ‘Are you going to resolve the issues in Syria? Are you going to fight Hezbollah? Are you going to try to get the hostages back?’ And at the same time have to defend yourself against cigars and champagne.' 'It's the wrong approach. There's no reason why Netanyahu's trial could not be postponed until after he's out of office and an ordinary citizen. This case proves beyond any doubt why the American system works. And if anybody ever tries to change the American system, we will cite the situation in Israel as proof why the American system is far better than the Israeli system.' Does this imply you feel that Prime Minister Netanyahu is being prosecuted by the legal system? 'I don't think that the case, as I've seen it, is strong enough to bring criminal charges. The criteria aren't clear, there should be rules as there are in many countries saying $1,000 of goods or items, not a penny more, but not a penny less. It shouldn't be left to the discretion of prosecutors and judges to determine how much is too much.' 'There are too many matters of degree in this case and matters of degree should never be the basis for criminal charges. The line should be crystal clear, and it's not.' Does seeing Prime Minister Netanyahu in court as a defendant cause Israel damage, especially in these times? 'I don't think he's causing them damage. I think the damage is being caused by the system. He should be allowed to be the prime minister 24/7.' 'He should be allowed to make the hard decisions about whether Israel should go into the Golan Heights, whether they should be bombing the chemical factories [in Syria], what attitude should be made toward the return of the hostages. That's a full-time job. It's not his it's the fault of the system that he's being detracted from that.' 'I know he said he can do both, the point is can he do it as well? And my view is that he should be allowed to be the prime minister as long as he is the elected prime minister of Israel without any interference. That doesn't put him above the law, that just changes the law so as to recognize the reality that a prime minister's job is a full-time job.' To your knowledge, how involved is U.S. President-elect Trump in the hostage negotiations? How significant is it for him? 'We don't know for sure, but President Trump's election by itself has had a big impact on the Middle East. There's no doubt that President Trump's election increased the deterrence against Iran attacking Israel.' 'Remember, Iran promised it would attack immediately and then as soon as Trump was elected, somehow that was forgotten. Now Trump has said that he wants the hostages returned by January 20. Don't know whether that will be, but it's a good thing. And so I'm glad from Israel's point of view that Trump is being very tough on the hostages. I hope it will have an impact. We all hope it will have an impact.' Can we assume that Trump's inauguration will bring about a hostage deal faster? 'We hope so. Trump believes in peace through strength. That you get peace through strength.' How do you think the relationship between Trump and Netanyahu will look like in the new administration? 'I can tell you this, just weeks after Trump was elected the first time, I was at Mar a Lago for dinner with a friend, and Trump walked in. He turned to me and he said: ‘You, I have to talk to you.’ And I said, ‘Why?’ He said, ‘You're a friend of Prime Minister Netanyahu.’ I said, ‘Yes.’ 'And he said, ‘I want to use you to send messages to your friend the prime minister.’ And I did. And I continue to serve, hopefully, as a bridge between two people I know quite well. Now, obviously, Trump can talk directly to the prime minister who he knows.' 'He can talk to, the prime minister's team who he knows and many people on Trump's team are very close to Israel. Obviously, Mike Huckabee, and many others. It's a close connection that has been nurtured over many years and I think it will serve both countries very well.' Can you share with us some of those, messages you delivered? 'Of course not.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Were they positive messages at least? 'They're positive messages, but often they have questions. Issues that need indirection rather than direction. Look, I'm happy to help any president of the United States, whether they're liberal or conservative or Republican or Democrat. I'm American. I'm a Zionist.' 'Everybody knows my views on Israel and America and I'm happy to help both countries in any way that's mutually beneficial.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkzj3cin1e	2024-12-11T02:09:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/10/S1ExcdrNyx/S1ExcdrNyx_0_0_1280_853_0_small.jpg

Iran's Khamenei says Assad's fall is US-Israel plot	Iran’s Supreme Leader accused the US and Israel of overthrowing the Assad regime in Syria, as tensions rise in Tehran; Revolutionary Guard commanders engage in a blame game, with criticism mounting against Quds Force leadership over Iran’s collapsing influence in Syria and the region Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, addressed what he called the 'recent regional developments' in a public speech, breaking his silence on the collapse of Bashar Assad’s regime in Syria. Khamenei pointed fingers at the United States and Israel, declaring, 'There is no doubt that what happened in Syria was orchestrated in American and Israeli command rooms.' However, contrary to Khamenei’s claims, global intelligence agencies – including Israeli organizations like the General Intelligence Directorate and Mossad – were reportedly caught off guard by the rebels’ rapid success and Assad’s downfall. Turkey, Tehran and Moscow were equally blindsided by the speed of the regime’s collapse. During his speech, Khamenei also took aim at an unnamed 'neighboring country to Syria,' accusing them of playing a role in Assad’s fall. 'Even the neighboring government has had a hand in this, but the main culprits are the U.S. and Israel,' he said. Without elaborating, he added: 'There is a nation that played a prominent role in what happened in Syria – and continues to do so.' Despite the collapse of Assad’s regime, Khamenei maintained that Iran’s regional influence remains intact. 'The resistance will now expand across the entire region, stronger than ever before,' he proclaimed. 'Those who believed weakening the resistance would weaken Iran fundamentally misunderstand the essence of resistance. Iran is strong and will only grow stronger. The more they fight the resistance, the broader its front will become, encompassing the whole region.' In an official statement released before Khamenei’s speech, Iran reiterated its commitment to maintaining 'friendly' relations with Syria, stating, 'Iran and Syria share a long history, and we expect this friendly relationship to continue.' Blame game erupts in Iran over Assad’s collapse Even before Khamenei’s speech, Tehran was already embroiled in a heated internal blame game over the rapid collapse of Assad’s regime, which many see as a devastating blow to Iran’s regional axis of power –an influence it had painstakingly built over decades. Within Iran’s security forces, tensions have reached a boiling point. Members of the Revolutionary Guard described the atmosphere as chaotic, filled with mutual accusations and frustration. 'It’s a mix of people yelling at each other, punching walls, kicking over trash cans – everyone is blaming someone else,' a source in Tehran told The Telegraph. 'No one is taking responsibility.' The source explained that Iran’s leadership was completely unprepared for Assad’s departure. 'No one ever anticipated Assad would flee. For the past 10 years, our entire focus was on keeping him in power. And it wasn’t because we loved him, but because his presence ensured our proximity to Hezbollah and Israel.' Iran had invested millions of dollars in propping up Assad’s regime, actively intervening in Syria’s civil war since the mid-2010s. Yet, Assad fled the country just before rebel forces reached Damascus. The rebels’ offensive was launched as a surprise attack, coinciding with a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah – another key pillar of Iran’s regional axis. 'You need people on the ground to send weapons, but they’re either being killed or fleeing,' another Revolutionary Guard source shared. 'Right now, everyone is focused on figuring out how to move forward from this deadlock. No one is even talking about weapons anymore; everyone is just trying to make sense of what’s happening and how dangerous this situation is for Iran.' Some within the Revolutionary Guard have begun directing their anger at Ismail Qaani, the commander of the Quds Force, accusing him of allowing Assad’s army to fall apart. 'No one dares to tell him this directly, but he bears responsibility. He didn’t do anything to stop Iran’s interests from collapsing. Our allies are falling one after another, and he’s just watching from Tehran. Worse days may be ahead,' the source warned. Tehran faces leadership crisis amid defeat Behind the scenes, Tehran is grappling with an internal crisis. Revolutionary Guard insiders have suggested Supreme Leader Khamenei may be considering replacing Qaani, with growing calls for his removal. The commander has come under increased scrutiny, particularly after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was assassinated. Following Nasrallah’s death, Qaani disappeared for an extended period, leading to speculation that he might have been under investigation. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to sources, Khamenei has summoned senior commanders several times in recent days as the Syrian rebels advanced toward Damascus. 'The situation is bizarre, and heated discussions are taking place. There’s also increasing concern over what to tell Iran’s supporters,' a Revolutionary Guard insider revealed. For years, Syria has served as a linchpin in Iran’s broader regional strategy, providing a critical corridor for supporting Hezbollah and exerting influence in the Middle East. The sudden collapse of Assad’s regime has dealt a heavy blow to this strategy, leaving Tehran scrambling to reassess its position and navigate the fallout from this unexpected defeat. With its axis of influence unraveling, Iran faces the sobering challenge of rebuilding its regional foothold in the face of mounting adversities. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hktv3pivje	2024-12-11T01:18:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/Hkghj1aL4Je/Hkghj1aL4Je_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Rebels take over 70% of Syria, as Israeli strikes on country's mi...	Leading Syrian rebel faction has remained silent about Israeli strikes on Syrian government military infrastructure; Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham in the northwest and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the northeast are trying to reach a permanent cease-fire to ensure 'a political process for Syria’s future' Reports continue to emerge from Syria showcasing the extensive destruction of former President Bashar al-Assad’s military infrastructure, targeted by Israel. According to IDF estimates, the campaign has wiped out approximately 70%–80% of Syria’s strategic capabilities. Over 350 airstrikes were carried out, hitting around 320 critical targets. One of the most significant strikes occurred at Kamishli Airport, located near the Turkish border, over 400 miles from Israel’s northernmost point. Additionally, new images from Barzeh, near Damascus, reveal near-total destruction of the infamous Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center, a facility linked to Assad’s chemical weapons program. This site, suspected of being used by Iran for missile development, has been repeatedly targeted by Israel in recent years. Meanwhile, Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, the leading Syrian rebel faction, has remained silent about the Israeli strikes. The group's focus appears to be on forming a provisional government to consolidate control over Syria following the rapid fall of Assad’s regime. NBC News reports that the Biden administration is considering removing Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham from the U.S. list of terrorist organizations, a move that would also lift the $10 million bounty on the group’s leader, Abu Mohammad al-Julani. Residents of Damascus describe the recent days as a surreal mix of terror and relief. 'Gunmen are firing into the air in celebration, shaking the streets, while Israeli airstrikes echo in the distance. It feels like a nightmare, but then you remind yourself it’s also a dream come true – because Assad is gone,' Moutaz Hussein, a local, told The Wall Street Journal. Another resident, Hani Qousbatoi, told The Washington Post: 'The fear is starting to fade, but now the only concern is the Israeli strikes.' While Assad and his family have reportedly sought asylum in Moscow, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov confirmed in an NBC interview that Russia facilitated their 'secure relocation.' When asked if Assad would face trial, Ryabkov deflected, saying, 'Russia is not a party to the International Criminal Court.' Arab media has closely followed the developments in Syria, particularly Israel’s unprecedented military activity. Lebanon’s Al-Akhbar, known for its ties to Hezbollah, headlined the situation as 'The Struggle of the 'Day After.'' The outlet noted that since Assad’s fall, Israel has launched its most extensive strikes on Syria since 1973, combining airstrikes with limited ground operations. Qatar’s Al-Arabi al-Jadid newspaper accused Israel of turning Syria into 'fair game,' highlighting its strikes on military infrastructure and defensive systems, as well as alleged Israeli actions in the Golan Heights, which have drawn official condemnations from several Arab nations. UN Special Envoy to Syria Geir Pedersen called for Israel to halt its strikes, accusing it of exploiting the situation. 'This must stop. Syrian factions are working to establish a stable government, and international actors should not derail this process,' he said. The operation primarily targeted Iranian entrenchment in Syria and the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah, while also aiming to create a secure buffer zone along Israel’s northern border. The IDF has emphasized the campaign is an ongoing effort requiring constant monitoring and precise intelligence. Military officials stress that Israel is not involved in Syria’s internal conflict and is operating solely to protect its own security and the residents of the Golan Heights. They also noted that, despite their activity in the buffer zone, Israeli forces are avoiding direct engagement with local Syrian populations. Israel began its operation even before Assad’s fall was certain. In the 24 hours leading up to the operation, the IDF expanded its air superiority, enabling hundreds of strikes on key targets. These included aircraft, coastal and surface-to-air missiles, underground facilities, weapons depots, Scud missiles, cruise missiles, radar systems, tanks, and advanced Syrian naval vessels equipped with coastal missiles. Intelligence for these strikes had been gathered over years. Rebels take control of 70% of Syria, but fighting continues The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that rebel forces now control 70% of Syrian territory. However, fighting persists in several regions. Hassan Abd al-Rani, a senior rebel commander, announced that opposition forces have fully captured Deir ez-Zor, a city in eastern Syria that had been a stronghold for pro-Iranian militias. The city was heavily bombed by U.S.-led coalition forces during the war, and coalition bases in the region were also targeted in retaliatory strikes. In another hotspot, the northern city of Manbij in Aleppo Province, clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) – comprised of Kurdish rebels and financed by the United States – and opposition forces reportedly led to a ceasefire agreement. SDF Commander Mazloum Abdi stated that his forces, with U.S. backing, reached a truce with Turkish-supported Syrian opposition groups to ensure 'safety and security for the people.' Abdi added, 'Our goal is a nationwide ceasefire and a political process for Syria’s future.'

They also announced a ban on the seizure of public property and the occupation of government institutions or military outposts. The situation in Syria remains fluid, with significant challenges ahead despite the rebels’ territorial gains. As the dust settles from Assad’s downfall, the focus now shifts to rebuilding and stabilizing a fractured nation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkzzj2lvye	2024-12-10T23:47:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/BJXwziUE1l/BJXwziUE1l_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Three men who made pilgrimage to West Bank shrine managed to escape and evacuate to the hospital after suffering minor injuries; IDF reports incident is under investigation Three Breslov Hasidic Jews entered Joseph’s Tomb in the West Bank's Nablus Tuesday overnight independently and without coordination with security authorities. According to security sources, suspects opened fire at their vehicle. The three sustained minor injuries and managed to escape, eventually reaching Hadassah University Hospital. 'A report was received overnight regarding suspects opening fire at an Israeli vehicle that breached a checkpoint and illegally entered the city of Nablus,' the IDF said in a statement. 'The vehicle exited the city and its occupants independently evacuated themselves to the hospital. The incident is under investigation.' 'The three men are being detained for questioning by the Israel Police. Entry into Area A is dangerous and prohibited for Israelis by law,' the military added. This incident comes just two days after a similar case in which Hasidic Jews entered the site without coordination. That incident ended with their vehicle being found abandoned and set on fire.

Division working near the Golan Heights plants new mines and combat engineering tactics to prevent possible terrorist infiltrations on the border The IDF is accelerating its 'New East' project and adding new combat engineering elements along the international border in the Golan Heights to prevent the scenario of armed terrorists infiltrating Israel. The 210th Division’s engineering unit, which oversees the Golan Heights sector, mobilized additional work teams from other regions in recent days to expedite the plan that began even before the start of the war in Gaza – with the goal of disrupting vehicle-mounted incursions using light off-road vehicles. Teams are operating throughout the week, sometimes at night, and, following the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime and the takeover of the Syrian Golan by unaffiliated armed rebels, the work teams are also secured by deployed IDF forces in the buffer zone over the last week. Tactical combat engineering lessons learned partly from how Hamas' Nukhba terrorists’ breached the western Negev are being applied in the Golan. The work includes new minefields, deploying explosive charges and digging deep trenches. The IDF is prioritizing fortifications in areas closer to threatened settlements in the area and sectors with limited visibility, such as the hilly northern Golan or the rocky Wadi ar Ruqqad in the south. Some operations involve engineering explosives to give the buffer zone near the border a 'facelift' not seen since the 1974 cease-fire agreement with Syria. 'We've also leased civilian equipment and dozens of bulldozers and excavators are working swiftly and efficiently. It's a dynamic border obstacle with components tailored to the threat,' one of the division’s officers said on Tuesday. The morning after Assad's regime fell, the IDF entered the buffer zone. According to foreign reports, tanks and infantry forces were stationed along the Golan border’s Alpha Line. That night, IDF fighter jets reportedly carried out waves of strikes around Damascus, targeting advanced weapon systems and arms production facilities to prevent them from falling into rebel hands. A chemical weapons depot in Syria was also targeted. The IDF stressed at the time that 'the IDF does not intervene in events taking place in Syria. The IDF will continue to operate as necessary to maintain the buffer zone and protect the State of Israel and its citizens.' Strikes in Syria continued at the same time and the IDF prevented arms smuggling into Lebanon. After special forces operatives crossed the border and seized the highest Mount Hermon peak – for the first time in over 50 years – the military bolstered artillery and tank forces in the Golan and the buffer zone, as well as at key Syrian control points near the border. Syrian army posts in the Golan were abandoned and the IDF is monitoring the remaining weaponry in the area. The Syrian opposition-affiliated Voice of the Capital news outlet claimed that 'Israel is systematically destroying all brigades and battalions of the previous regime in southern Syria, directly targeting all air defense systems, missile depots and development and production facilities.

Assad’s regime developed various capabilities over the years with support from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. Now, with the rebels' takeover, all its assets could fall into their hands and eventually be directed against Israel. The rebel groups are diverse and unpredictable, making weapons like chemical arms in the hands of extremist Sunni Islamic rebels a serious risk. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rki2ajlvyl	2024-12-10T23:00:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/HyXfg00UN4ke/HyXfg00UN4ke_0_728_1536_864_0_small.jpg
Iran’s Khamenei: ‘What happened in Syria was planned in Israel’	Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei addressed Bashar Assad’s regime’s fall in Syria on Wednesday saying there was 'no doubt what happened in Syria was planned in the Israeli and American control room.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r100r46in1e	2024-12-10T22:50:41-08:00	
Syrians return home after 11 years in exile, face legal and infra...	Turkish political parties in the government and the opposition have long called on refugees to return to Syria voluntarily – an appeal made much more relevant by the fall of the regime After 11 years living as a refugee in Gaziantep, Turkey, Mohammed returned home to Aleppo for the first time this week. He is just one of the thousands of Syrian refugees already returning to Syria in the wake of Bashar Assad’s fall from power, in the first voluntary, formal return of Syrians since the civil war broke out in 2011. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians in Turkey took to the streets on December 8 to celebrate the end of the Assad regime, but the return home may be more complicated than the celebration suggests. Syria lacks basic infrastructure, and many refugees are missing official documents and legal records. Mohammed, who arrived in Aleppo yesterday with his wife and children, said that he had reunited with his mother after 11 years of separation. His decision to return wasn’t thoroughly planned, but it seemed inevitable once the regime fell, Mohammed said, since Assad was the reason his family fled. The return of Turkey’s 3 million Syrian refugees has long been advocated by Turkish opposition parties as well as the government. Hosting the Syrians, who have temporary residency status, has created a burden on Turkey. The strain has sparked political tension between parties and increased racist incidents in recent years. Violent attacks on Syrian refugees have often been met with a lax response from authorities. On Wednesday, Turkey announced that all its border crossings with Syria would operate 24/7 and allow for the free passage of belongings and household items into Syria. Analysts view this as an effort to clear major Turkish cities of Syrians, whom opposition parties have used as a pressure point against the Turkish government. Human rights activist Molham Al-Sayed said that opposition parties have long pushed for a voluntary return of Syrians when clashing with the government. Turkish authorities made similar arguments when clashing with the EU, Al-Sayed said. Now that many Syrians are voluntarily returning, those polemics will be put to bed, he said. Many Syrians in Turkey believe it is still premature to make the return, fearing that Syria could spiral back into chaos. Ahmed Mansour, a refugee living in Istanbul, said that he has not yet decided whether to return. He cited Syria’s current state of disorder and emphasized the need for careful consideration. Legal expert Mahmoud Hammam told The Media Line that refugees ought to resolve any legal issues in Turkey before leaving. He cautioned against a hasty departure, noting that unresolved issues such as bank accounts, electricity and water accounts, or improperly returned properties could result in significant losses. Some of those returning to Syria have lived their entire lives in Turkey. After 13 years in Mersin, Turkey, Ibrahim is headed back to Damascus with his son and daughter, who were born in Turkey and have never seen Syria.

'They’re simply excited to meet their grandparents and relatives whom they’ve only communicated with online for years.' Taghreed, another refugee, said that Syrians now have the opportunity to reunite with their families and close this painful chapter of displacement. 'These are historic moments for Syrian families,' she said.

Optimistic messages and conflicting reports: 'Not there yet' on h...	Senior Israeli officials have been informed that Hamas is interested in a cease-fire and hostage deal but there are still gaps, including the number of hostages who will be released in the first round; Sources familiar with the details have denied reports that Hamas lists of living hostages have been transferred to Egypt Senior Israeli officials were informed Tuesday night that Hamas wants a cease-fire and hostage release deal, in light of the visit of Shin Bet head Ronen Bar and IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi to Egypt , and the assessment in Israel that a deal could be reached within a month. Israel, however, denies that there lists of hostages who will be released in the first phase of the deal have already been produced and passed from Hamas to Egypt in recent days, despite Arab reports. 'We're not there yet,' said sources familiar with the details. In addition, there is also substantial disagreement over the number of hostages who will be released in the first round. In Egypt, Bar and Levy met with their counterparts and discussed regional security issues against the backdrop of assessments that a deal could be reached to release the hostages 'within a week or two.' The meeting dealt, among other things, with the sensitive situation in the Middle East after the fall of the Assad regime in Syria. In addition, they also discussed security issues between the countries, including the issue of the hostage deal and specifically the Philadelphi Corridor, although as far as is known this is not an official negotiating delegation. Senior Israeli and Egyptian officials have met from time to time and as needed several times since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip in order to discuss security issues. According to the same reports about the lists that were transferred, such as one published in the Saudi Asharq Al-Awsat, the meeting between Halevi and Bar and their Egyptian counterparts included receiving a list of names of live hostages, some 30 in number. The newspaper quoted a 'source familiar with the details of the deal' as saying that 'the meaning of the visit is that we are closer to a cease-fire.' The newspaper noted that acceptance of the Egyptian proposal might come by the end of the week, or at the latest by the middle of the month. According to the same source, the proposal under discussion talks about a cease-fire of up to 60 days, at a rate of two days for each Israeli hostage, while Hamas will keep the soldiers and 'the most important hostages' for additional rounds. A political source told Ynet Tuesday that progress has been made on the issue of negotiations for a hostage deal. 'The starting point so far was that Hamas did not want a deal, and today it seems as if this has changed. Until two weeks ago, I thought Hamas did not want a deal, and today I tend to think that it has changed its mind,' he said. 'The situation has changed,' the source also claimed. 'The conditions have changed. Hamas wanted many fronts and that's over. There are no fronts, so there is a chance of reaching a deal in the coming month.' Former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant met Tuesday at the White House with Brett McGurk, the U.S. presidential envoy to the Middle East. 'At the center of our conversation was the real possibility of a breakthrough on the issue of the release of the hostages in the near future. I emphasized to the presidential envoy that the coming days will be critical for the release of the kidnapped and that I view this mission as of supreme national and ethical importance,' Gallant said. 'The current progress is made possible by the series of operational achievements that the State of Israel has achieved through its security forces in all sectors of the fighting - in Gaza, Lebanon and Iran, which has established the strength and supremacy of the State of Israel throughout the Middle East, and weakened the Shiite axis, to the point of the fall of the murderous Assad regime. Also in the continuation of my expected meetings in Washington, I will place the vital task facing us at the center of the discussion - to return the hostages to Israel.' Meanwhile, Minister Yoav Ben-Tzur of the Shas Party said that party chairman Aryeh Deri 'is working in every way for the welfare of the families of the hostages, and in the confidential discussions he is pushing with all his might for a deal to return them, a deal that security officials support.' He added: 'The return of the hostages is our duty and our responsibility, and our desire is a quick deal and the release of everyone in one fell swoop.' A senior Egyptian official told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth Tuesday morning that the announcement of an arrangement that would lead to a cease-fire and a deal is 'very close.' A Hamas delegation led by senior Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya left Cairo on Sunday night, following discussions with the head of Egyptian intelligence, General Hassan Mahmoud Rashad, and his team. On Tuesday, it was reported that the delegation had handed over to the Egyptians a detailed list of Israeli hostages - sick and elderly, women and men - that Hamas is offering to release in the first phase. The Hamas delegation also handed over a detailed list of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons that Hamas is demanding to be released as part of the new deal. The Egyptian official clarified that an Israeli delegation is scheduled to leave for Cairo this week for a meeting at the intelligence headquarters, during which they will be given the lists of Palestinian hostages and prisoners. Hamas made it clear to Egypt that 'there is a better chance than ever before of closing a deal,' in exchange for the release of the prisoners and Israel's withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor and other areas in the Gaza Strip.

This is how world media is reporting about Netanyahu's corruption...	International media outlets emphasize the precedent of a sitting prime minister going on trial - in the middle of a war; Fox News notes Netanyahu's jab at former President Barack Obama The leading Western media outlets did not ignore the historical event that took place on Tuesday in Tel Aviv, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu became the country's first sitting prime minister to testify as a criminal defendant. CNN noted that this was the first time that a serving prime minister in Israel had been called to testify in a criminal trial against him, and emphasized that Netanyahu claimed that the Israeli media, which is characterized by left-wing ideologies, had attacked him for years for his 'security policy.' CNN also noted that the 75-year-old Netanyahu has been forced to testify during the war in Gaza and the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, splitting his time between the courtroom three times a week and the war room in the defense headquarters at the Kirya base in Tel Aviv, which is just minutes away. 'Outside the courthouse, he is one of the most powerful men in the Middle East,' wrote the New York Times, who oversees 'Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, its occupation of southern Lebanon and recent strikes in Syria.' The newspaper chose to emphasize that: 'As he stepped into a cramped and sweltering underground courtroom in Tel Aviv on Tuesday morning, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel morphed into the defendant in Case 67104-01-20 – charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust.' The New York Times added that: 'Eight years after the police started investigating him and four years after his trial began, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister was taking the stand for the first time to respond to accusations of corruption that have defined and disrupted Israeli public life for nearly a decade.' Obama made it clear to me that U.S. policy was going to take a sharp turn against the ideas I believed in The Wall Street Journal opened with a description of Netanyahu's duties as prime minister as well as his long-awaited trial. 'Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the stand on Tuesday to testify in his long-running corruption trial even as he manages a multi-front war – underscoring the tensions around his leadership,' the newspaper reported. The WSJ also did not ignore the fact that this was a precedent in Israel, listing the charges against Netanyahu and the fact that his testimony would last at least several weeks. The Journal also emphasized that the trial is a reminder of the controversy in Israeli society surrounding his leadership, the change in Netanyahu's attitude toward the judicial system following his legal troubles, the attempted judicial overhaul and the protests that followed. The Washington Post focused on the fact that Netanyahu had tried to avoid appearing in court for years, despite the prime minister's claims that he had 'waited eight years to speak and present the truth.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Netanyahu rejects 'absurd' charges at corruption trial,' read the BBC headline. The British news website, known for its hostile attitude toward Israel, reported that the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history had become the first sitting prime minister to take the witness stand as a criminal defendant. His lawyer, Amit Haddad, claimed that this was a biased trial and that his client was 'the victim of a political witch hunt,' since 'the prosecution did not investigate a crime, but an individual.' It later noted that Netanyahu had downplayed the charges against him, emphasizing his political legacy. A different and unusual angle of coverage was presented on the Fox News website, where it emphasized Netanyahu's rocky relationship with former President Barack Obama and his then-Secretary of State John Kerry. 'Obama made it clear to me that U.S. policy was going to take a sharp turn against the ideas I believed in,' Netanyahu recounted of his interactions with the U.S. in the early days of the Obama administration.

Yemenis wish for fall of the Houthis just as Damascus was liberat...	The collapse of the Axis of Resistance emboldens Yemeni dissidents to hope for the fall of the Houthis; Political researcher in Yemen says: 'What happened in Syria should worry the Houthis' The overthrow of the Assad regime in Syria and the weakening of the Iranian-Shiite axis raise concerns for the Houthis in Yemen. There are already those who do not rule out the possibility that Sanaa will be liberated from the Houthis just as Damascus was liberated from Bashar Assad. 'It is a matter of time before the Houthis will face the anger of the people over their injustices,' Yemeni political commentator Mahmoud al-Taher told the Saudi newspaper Asharq al-Awsat. The Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed wrote on Tuesday that the consequences of the rapid collapse of the Assad regime are not limited to Syria, and are expected to affect the entire region, especially the Iranian proxies, which include the Houthis. The resistance axis has been subjected to extensive attacks in Lebanon and Syria in recent months, and Iran has also suffered a blow from Israel. The impact on support for militias loyal to the axis could be decisive. Yemeni political researcher Adnan Hashem told the Qatari newspaper that the fall of Assad could certainly symbolize the end of the Axis of Resistance, or at least deal a strategic blow that should worry the Houthis and make them reconsider their steps. 'They are part of the axis, and Iran is recalculating,' said the political researcher. 'Therefore, the question is whether there is an element that is able to benefit from the circumstances.' Iran's intervention in Syria and its protection of the regime then led the Houthis to storm Sanaa The researcher also noted that the collapsed regime in Syria did not have any significant relations with the Houthis as Assad recently closed the Houthi-run Yemeni embassy in Damascus and asked its employees to leave Syria. At the same time, he was the first to recognize the terrorist organization and gave it military advice. 'The revolution in Syria will lead to the weakness of the Houthis' Yemeni journalist Salman al-Makrami told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that the Arab region cannot be separated, especially when it comes to geopolitical changes such as the fall of the Assad regime. According to him, Iran's intervention in Syria and its protection of the regime then led the Houthis to storm Sanaa. The journalist explained that the fall of the city of Aleppo in 2016 to the Syrian regime and later to other cities in its territory, led to the concentration of efforts by Iran and Hezbollah in the conflict in Yemen and the Houthis' shift from defense to offense. Therefore, he said, 'the revolution in Syria will lead to the weakness of the Houthis.' Makrami added that the Houthis' are heavily dependent on Iran, Hezbollah, the Syrian regime, and the Hashd al-Shaabi forces, which unite Shiite militias supported by the Iraqi government. According to him, the loss of these arms makes the Houthis, for the first time since their establishment, dependent on an incompetent ally. 'Until now, the Houthis have not dared to publish a statement of support in which they mentioned the Syrian government. Their media has launched a fierce attack on the Syrian opposition,' he explained. The Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat reported on Monday that the dramatic events in Syria have awakened the appetite of Houthi opponents who are hoping for a coup in Yemen. While members of the terrorist organization are fearful of the developments, the opponents have not hidden their joy at Iran's defeat in Syria, and hope that something similar will lead to the restoration of Sanaa. The chairman of the Presidential Leadership Council in Yemen, Rashad al-Alimi, said: 'The time has come for the Iranian regime to lift its hand from Yemen, respect its sovereignty and identity, and allow its children to build their country and create the best future that everyone deserves.' The Yemeni people certainly have good reasons to be angry. The images of prisoners seen being released in recent days from prisons in Syria, after decades of being held in harsh and horrific conditions, remind Yemenis of what the Houthis are doing in their country. This terrorist organization also holds political opponents in prisons, carries out indiscriminate arrests, and separates children from their families to take them to terror camps.

Israel can ‘completely destroy enemy army without war’ if it cont...	Israel has taken control of Syria's buffer zone, including Mount Hermon, citing strategic security; Experts warn instability post-Assad poses risks, with extremist groups gaining ground requiring potential long-term Israeli presence Israel’s concern that the instability in Syria could spill over into its territory has led it to major action in the neighboring country, essentially opening an additional front in the multi-front war it has been engaged in for 14 months. Over the weekend, the Israel Defense Forces took control of the demilitarized buffer zone in Syria that was established as part of a 1974 cease-fire reached between the two hostile countries. In that buffer zone is Mt. Hermon's highest peak, the highest point on the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea. 'The territory guarantees strategic control over the whole southern Syrian arena, which generates an immediate threat to Israel,' according to Kobi Michael, a researcher at INSS and the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy. 'There is no higher vantage point than the Syrian part of the Golan.' Power in Syria is now de-centralized, with the country fragmented between several groups, most of them extreme Islamist, potentially posing a new array of threats to Israel. 'Israel is not looking to apply sovereignty to the buffer zone, but rather to militarily control the area in order to prevent danger under conditions of instability,' Michael assessed. Israeli officials have emphasized the tactical nature of the move, which also likely stems from the trauma from the surprise attack executed by Hamas terrorist on its border with Gaza last year. 'For decades, the Israeli security establishment considered the border with Syria its quietest and closely associated to the Assad regime,' said Dr. Joel Parker, a researcher from the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University. 'Assad is the devil Israel knows, but at the same time, with the de-facto commitment to non-aggression with Syria, Israel watched it build up military abilities, including the development of chemical weapons, to levels that were far beyond when the armistice line was created.' In 2007, however, Israel carried out an airstrike against a suspected Syrian nuclear site. Years later, it took responsibility for the attack. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would not allow its neighbors to develop nuclear weapons. Syria denied the site was a nuclear reactor. Now, Israel is taking advantage of the internal chaos. The Israeli military swiftly entered Syria, apparently reaching deep into its territory and taking control of the peak of Mount Hermon, which allows for an advantageous view of both Syria and Lebanon. Reportedly, the army also conducted airstrikes in Syria against sites that stored unconventional weapons, air-defense systems, and navy vessels. Video on social media showed explosions in various cities and pictures of alleged Syrian Air Force bases destroyed. 'This is an unprecedented event in which the Israeli army has the ability to completely destroy an enemy army without a war,' said Michael. 'This opportunity is being used wisely by Israel in order to ensure a better reality.' The IDF only confirmed it had entered the buffer zone and was holding positions there, denying reports its forces were approaching the capital, Damascus. This offensive has so far gone without a response from Syria or any of the factions currently holding control. Israel captured part of the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967 Mideast war. It annexed the territories in a move that was considered illegal by most of the international community, which still considers the territory Syrian. In 2019, the US departed from decades of policy and recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the territory. The other part of the mountainous area remained in Syria’s control. UN forces have patrolled the buffer zone since the 1974 agreement. 'The Golan Heights will be an inseparable part of the State of Israel forever,' said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a press conference he held on Monday night, indicating his country’s intentions. Netanyahu defined the movement into the buffer zone as temporary, but in the Middle East, what often begins as temporary often becomes permanent. The UN said the move violated international agreements. Arab leaders condemned it, and a spokesperson for the US State Department said that while it expected the move to be temporary, the US understood Israeli motives. 'The Syrian army abandoned its positions in the area … which potentially creates a vacuum that could have been filled by terrorist organizations that would threaten the state of Israel…every country has the right to take action against terrorist organizations, and every country, I think, would be worried about a possible vacuum that could be filled by terrorist organizations on its border, especially in volatile times, as we obviously are in right now in Syria,' said Matthew Miller. Israel is concerned that the different groups that are now clamoring for power in Syria after the regime of President Bashar Assad collapsed will be hostile. Abu Mohammed al-Golani, who led the insurgency against Assad, is a former Al-Qaida terrorist who claims he has reformed and abandoned extremism. Classified by the US as a terrorist and previously imprisoned for his activities, he has been associated with the extremist Islamic State of Iraq, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Al-Golani leads Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), or the Organization for Liberating Syria. Videos on social media earlier this week showed HTS members vowing to help Palestinians in Gaza act against Israel and liberate Jerusalem from Israeli control. 'What is known about al-Golani poses red flags for Israel,' said Parker. 'He is the new kid on the block, associated with many jihadist operatives in the world, which has access to almost unlimited manpower. His charisma, his jihadi ideology, and his current control in Syria have Israel wanting to have access to chemical weapons, ballistic missiles, and even helicopters.'

'There is no way to tell where this is going,' said Michael. 'Israel could be facing a difficult reality that will force it to stay and broaden its hold on territory, perhaps even act more forcefully in order to pre-empt danger.' The collapse of the Assad regime is one of the most significant shifts to occur in the Middle East in decades. While Israel and Syria were sworn enemies under both Bashar Assad and his father, there was stability in the relationship, which has now been rattled. While this has removed Iranian presence from Israel’s border, it could be replaced by extreme Islam, which is also not favorable to the Jewish state. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hkkwevlvkl	2024-12-10T12:52:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/08/HJfS4147VJe/HJfS4147VJe_0_207_1280_721_0_small.jpg

The United States has asked Syria's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) rebel group to help locate and free missing American journalist Austin Tice as it liberates the country's prisons in the aftermath of Bashar Assad's overthrow, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Tuesday. Washington is telling all parties in Syria that Tice, who was abducted in Syria in 2012, is a top U.S. priority, Miller told a press briefing. Miller said that message had been sent via intermediaries to HTS, 'In all of our communications with parties that we know talk to HTS, we have sent very clearly the message that as they move through Syria liberating prisons, that our top priority is the return of Austin Tice,' he said. 'We want anyone who's operating on the ground in Syria to be on the lookout for him, and if they do find him, to return to him to us safely as soon as possible.'

World Central Kitchen fires 62 employees in Gaza deemed 'security...	Aid organization fires dozens of employees after security background checks conducted by Israel; Comes after 3 of its employees were killed in IDF strike targeting one of the men, a Hamas terrorist who participated in the October 7 massacre The international aid organization World Central Kitchen, which operates community kitchens in the Gaza Strip, has fired at least 62 of its 500 employees after security background checks conducted by Israel. The layoffs came after several employees were identified as potential 'security threats,' and a week after airstrikes killed three of the organization's employees. The dismissals occurred a week after the Israeli Air Force attacked a vehicle belonging to the organization, which led to the deaths of five people, including three employees of the organization. The IDF said at the time that the target was a Hamas operative who participated in the October 7 massacre and was later found to be an employee of the organization In response, the organization issued an internal notice in Arabic to its employees, stating that the names of the employees had been transferred to Israel for security checks, and that a number of team members had been identified as a security threat and that it had been decided to terminate their employment 'for the safety of everyone in Gaza.' The World Central Kitchen, founded by Spanish chef Jose Andres, currently operates dozens of community kitchens in Gaza, mainly in the center and south of the strip. The organization's activities were suspended for a week after the latest airstrike. 'We are heartbroken that a vehicle carrying our employees was attacked by Israel. We are working with incomplete information, and are looking for more information,' the organization said at the time. 'We had no idea that anyone in the vehicle was in any way connected to the Hamas attack on October 7. The organization is suspending its activities in the Gaza Strip for the time being. Our hearts are with our colleagues and their families at this time.' In April, seven of the organization's employees were killed in an Israeli drone attack on its convoy of vehicles. The IDF later admitted that the attack was carried out by mistake after the vehicles were incorrectly identified. The incident, which sparked an international outcry, led to a suspension of the organization's activities. After about two and a half months, it resumed operations. Among the dead were three British citizens, a Polish citizen, an American-Canadian citizen, an Australian citizen, and one Palestinian. In Israel, the organization produces food under the supervision of chef Ruthie Russo, which it distributes to residents of the north. Since the outbreak of the war, the organization has distributed nearly two million food portions to residents, approximately 40,000 portions per day - all funded by the WCK. The organization's catering operates in the Tefen local council, which is near Karmiel, and produces hot meals as well as food baskets that include vegetables, fruit, milk and bread - all according to the needs of the residents. The food baskets are packaged at the Pitchon Lev organization headquarters in Karmiel, and are distributed through the municipal authorities.

'The terrorist was under intelligence surveillance for a long time, and was attacked following reliable information about his real-time location,' an IDF spokesman said last week. 'We emphasize that these are civilian vehicles traveling on an unspecified route for the purpose of delivering aid.' He added that 'the IDF and Shin Bet will continue to act resolutely to locate and eliminate terrorist operatives who carry out terrorist acts against Israeli citizens, as well as those involved in the murderous massacre on October 7.'

Nasrallah assassination site becomes pilgrimage center	Although a funeral date has not yet been set for former Hezbollah Secretary-General in Beirut, his supporters and followers have established a commemoration site in his honor The date for the funeral of former Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah has not yet been announced, but in the meantime the site of his assassination in the Dahieh district, a Hezbollah stronghold, has become a pilgrimage center. Nasrallah was assassinated on September 27 and the attack site is still a disaster zone of rubble, but the destruction does not prevent Hezbollah supporters from holding daily events there. A few days ago, a festive event was held there in memory of Nasrallah. The event, called 'Light from Light' was attended by hundreds of participants who waved pictures of the assassinated Hezbollah leader, waved the terror organization's flag, and lit candles. The entire complex was illuminated with strong lighting, which colored the ruins red. In the background, eulogies for Nasrallah and slogans calling for following in his terrorist footsteps were heard. As part of the event, excerpts of Nasrallah's voice were also played. Local and foreign media outlets were present. The Saudi Al-Arabiya network reported on Wednesday from the site of the assassination that supporters and followers of all ages attended the events. Attendees waved Hezbollah flags alongside pictures of the organization's leaders who were killed throughout the war. The victory posters throughout Dahieh do not reflect the situation on the ground. Dozens of destroyed buildings have become open spaces. A notable visitor last week in the rubble of Nasrallah's assassination site is the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon. He returned to Lebanon the previous Sunday for the first time since being injured in the September pager bombing operation and being transferred to receive medical treatment in Iran. He arrived at the site of Nasrallah's assassination on Tuesday, just two days after returning to his position in Lebanon. This was not his first media appearance after the injury, but his first appearance in Lebanon. From the scene of the assassination, he said: 'The Lebanese people will continue their resistance and these attacks will not benefit Israel. Lebanon will remain strong, will regain its lands, and we will continue to support it. I wanted to hold my first appearance after the treatment from here, so that we can draw determination and strength from the souls of the dead.' Al-Arabiya claimed that most visitors arrive at the site dressed in black, and that many of them doubt the ability of Nasrallah's successor, the current Secretary-General Naim Qassem, to steer the ship. A visitor who was present on the day of the Iranian ambassador's arrival praised Nasrallah: 'He should be an example for every Lebanese.' According to Al-Arabiya, supporters of the late Hezbollah secretary-general are awaiting the date of Nasrallah and Hashem Safieddine's funeral, which is expected to take place in Dahieh. According to the report, Hezbollah has not yet decided whether to hold the funeral before the end of the 60-day cease-fire with Israel or after. Hezbollah wants the event for Nasrallah and Hashem Safieddine to be exceptional and without interruptions. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In addition to the funeral issue, the newspaper said that the burial site is also in question. According to al-Diyar, Hezbollah is interested in building a shrine for Nasrallah and Hashem Safieddine, similar to the one erected for former Hezbollah Secretary-General Abbas al-Musawi in the village of a-Nabi Chit in the al-Baqa'a region in Lebanon. The location of the shrine is reportedly currently under discussion, with three options – two of them in Beirut's Dahieh and one in the area of the old road leading to the airport. The location will be chosen based on the available space and the capacity to accommodate visitors. In the meantime, it seems that, as time passes, the site of the assassination in Dahieh, among the ruins, is becoming a significant focal point for visitors supporting the terrorist organization. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy6lxeiv1l	2024-12-10T11:22:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/06/HJ8d2Fg4kg/HJ8d2Fg4kg_737_36_1952_1099_0_small.jpg

Car ramming in Bnei Brak declared terror attack	Young man, 21, run down by vehicle and slightly injured; Arab Israeli driver arrested in nearby parking garage; Incident first called criminal but later determined to be terror-related; Comes after earlier stabbing attack at at the Karmiel police station A 21-year-old man was slightly injured Tuesday in a car-ramming attack in Bnei Brak. Immediately after the incident, the police arrested the suspected driver, an Arab Israeli man from the northern Arab town of Zemer in his 20s, who tried to flee the scene of the attack. The police initially suspected that the incident was criminal, but later determined that it was a terror attack. See Ynet's exclusive footage of the attack: The incident occurred at 5:40 p.m. The police received a report of a hit-and-run accident on the street in Bnei Brak, with the driver fleeing the scene and continuing on his way. A motorcyclist chased after the suspect's vehicle. Officers from the Bnei Brak-Ramat Gan Police Motorcycle Unit pursued and caught the suspect in the vehicle, in a nearby underground parking garage where he had fled. The police said that an initial investigation revealed that, the driver of the vehicle swerved onto the sidewalk while driving, and intentionally hit a pedestrian and continued driving until he was stopped by the police. A Magen David Adom spokesperson said: 'A report was received at MDA's 101 hotline in the Dan region about a pedestrian who was hit by a vehicle in Bnei Brak. MDA medics and paramedics are providing medical treatment and are taking a 21-year-old man to Mayanei Hayeshua Hospital in a minor condition with injuries to his limbs and back.' At noon, a police officer and a security guard were stabbed at the Karmiel police station, and after initially reporting that the background was criminal, the police updated that 'the investigation is examining all possibilities.'

A rapidly intensifying wildfire burning just northwest of Los Angeles forced some residents in Malibu to evacuate as it threatened homes, knocked out power and closed roads in the beach community. The brush fire blaze, called the Franklin Fire, grew overnight from five acres (two hectares) to 2,200 acres (737 hectares) along steep terrain, spreading south over the Pacific Coast Highway in the picturesque coastal city of about 10,000 people. The fire, which has not yet been contained, has destroyed a small number of homes, but has not caused any injuries or deaths, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone told a news conference on Tuesday. 'We are going to have a coordinated ground and air assault,' Marrone said, noting that 300 additional firefighters will join the 700 already battling the blaze. 'Because of the difficulties in this particular area, time is of the essence for us to grab a hold of this fire.' The fire's cause remains unknown, Marrone said. An order for people to shelter in place was issued overnight for Pepperdine University in Malibu, forcing some students to evacuate to the school's commons and library.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjmd1z8nkl	2024-12-10T10:00:57-08:00

About 80% of Syrian military capabilities destroyed, IDF estimate...	After overthrow of the Assad regime, IDF attacked about 320 'strategic targets' in Syria; Monitoring what is happening in the neighboring country - as well as staying in the buffer zone - is an 'ongoing process,' IDF says; PM, in message from defense HQ, says: 'We want relations with the new regime, but if it allows Iran to return we will respond forcefully' The IDF estimates Tuesday evening that Operation Arrow of Bashan, which began on Saturday night, marks the end of the strategic phase of the offensive in Syria; Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reached out to the new regime and in a surprise statement said that Israel wants 'relations with the new regime.' In a statement from the Defense Ministries headquarters at the Kirya base in Tel Aviv, hours after his first day of testimony in his corruption trial, Netanyahu said that 'we have no intention of interfering in Syria's internal affairs, but we clearly intend to do what is necessary to ensure our security. We want relations with the regime, but if it allows Iran to return or establish itself in Syria or allows the transfer of Iranian weapons or any other weapons to Hezbollah or attacks us - we will respond forcefully. What happened to the previous regime will also happen to this regime.' 'Within this framework, I authorized the Air Force to bomb strategic military capabilities left behind by the Syrian army, so that they would not fall into the hands of the jihadists. This is similar to what the British Air Force did when it bombed the fleet of the Vichy regime that collaborated with the Nazis, so that it would not fall into the hands of the Nazis,' the prime minister added. Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates 'strongly' condemned the IDF's takeover of areas in the Golan buffer zone. The Foreign Ministry in Abu Dhabi said that it rejects Israel's actions, which 'threaten further regional escalation.' About 80% of Syria's strategic capabilities have been neutralized During Operation Arrow of Bashan, the IDF says, some 320 strategic targets were destroyed in over 350 airstrikes, which focused on aircraft, weapons depots, missiles and air defense batteries, along with strikes on warships and advanced missiles of the Syrian Navy. The operation, which began overnight between Saturday and Sunday, was conducted in close coordination between the IDF branches, with the Military Intelligence and Northern Command forces leading the planning and execution of the operation on the ground, while maintaining air superiority and maximum protection of the buffer zone. The operation included strategic strikes that involved, among others, the Air Force and the Navy. The actions taken were primarily intended to harm Iranian attempts to establish themselves in Syria and prevent the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah, while creating a safe buffer zone on the northern border. The IDF estimates that approximately 70%-80% of Syria's strategic capabilities were neutralized during the operation, and additional actions are being taken to ensure that strategic weapons do not fall into the hands of hostile elements. The IDF emphasizes that this is an ongoing process that requires constant monitoring and accurate intelligence gathering. The army also emphasized that it does not intervene in the internal fighting in Syria, and acts solely to protect Israel and the residents of the Golan. In this context, the IDF said that, despite the activity in the buffer zone, troops are avoiding friction with locals in Syria. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: At the same time, the IDF continues to monitor the stabilization of the terrain in the various conflict zones, while coordinating with the U.S. and the Lebanese army to prevent the weapons from falling into the hands of terrorist elements and other threats. Even though the Russian army has reduced its presence in the region, the IDF still identifies an Iranian presence and continues to monitor its activities. As part of cooperation with Egypt, high-level meetings were recently held that dealt with regional security issues, and the IDF emphasizes the importance working closely with international partners to preserve security stability. The IDF initiated the operations in Syria even before it was clear whether the Assad regime had fallen, and in the 24 hours preceding the operation in the buffer zone, it established air superiority and expanded it - which made possible the hundreds of attacks according to the priority of targets: aircraft, coastal missiles, underground bases, ships, weapons depots and weapons production facilities. Scud, cruise and surface-to-sea missiles, radars, tanks, surface-to-air missile batteries were also attacked, and the Air Force also attacked advanced vessels of the Syrian Air Force that had surface-to-sea missiles on them. Intelligence on all the targets was collected over several years, according to the IDF. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj2emwueke	2024-12-10T09:38:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/10/ryByBor4kg/ryByBor4kg_0_165_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Former hostage Noa Argamani recalls being injured in IDF strike o...	During emergency discussion with president on medical condition of remaining hostages, rescued hostage expresses concern about those she left behind; 'Doctor said I was a medical miracle, their fate might be worse than mine' Noa Argamani, who was rescued from captivity in Gaza in a heroic operation six months ago, participated Tuesday in an emergency discussion at the President's Office about the medical condition of the hostages. She said that in the full video of her taken by the terrorists during her captivity, she can be seen 'bruised, bleeding, with my entire head open, and no one came to help me. Not the Red Cross, not doctors, no one.' She referred in the public forum to the condition of the remaining hostages in captivity with great concern. 'We don't know what the condition of the 100 hostages who are still there is, and it is possible that their fate will be worse than mine,' she said. Argamani was joined by freed hostage Yocheved Lifshitz, whose husband Oded is still held captive in Gaza; Daniel Lifshitz, Oded's grandson; Professor Hagai Levine, head of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum health system, and Dr. Einat Yehene, a specialist rehabilitation psychologist from the forums' health system. Before Argamani's speech, the video from her Hamas captivity was shown. 'This is the shorter, censored video, because I wanted to spare you the full video,' she said. 'What actually happened was that the Air Force missile hit the building that I, Yossi Sharabi, and Itay Svirsky were in. As you know, Yossi did not survive. Two days later, Itay Svirsky was murdered and just this week his body was returned to Israel.' She added: 'I was left injured, and you see it in the full video. I'm talking about the fact that I was left there bruised, bleeding, with my whole head open, and no one came to help me. Not the Red Cross, not doctors, no one. When the doctors saw all the injuries when I returned, they said it was a medical miracle.' 'I was given the opportunity to be filmed while I was still in Gaza. I don't know how many hostages there are who suffered from the same situations as me, but they didn't have the right, they didn't get to publish a video like mine. In the end, I didn't receive treatment even though there was a video. We don’t know the condition of the 100 hostages still there, and their fate might be worse than mine.' Yocheved Lifshitz recalled how sick she was when she was released in the week-long hostage-for-prisoner exchange. 'I was in captivity for 17 days too many,' she said. 'I returned in a very sick state. I was sick and that was actually the reason they decided to release me because they were afraid I would infect everyone. While I was in captivity, I lost five kilos and my blood pressure dropped to the floor. If I had returned after 50 days, I would have returned in a coffin. What saved me was my contagious disease and the fact that the captors did not want me there.' Grandson Daniel Lipshitz spoke about how difficult it is to wait for the return of hostage relatives: 'The situation today is difficult and impossible, for each of the families who are still waiting. 431 days. 431 days of unimaginable suffering, physical and mental. Days of crying. The physical and mental deterioration is evident every day. There is nothing harder than waiting, knowing that you don't know what is happening, that you are all expecting a miracle to happen. And, yet, what gives the strength to continue and hold on is hope. The hope of seeing our loved ones return home for healing and burial,' he said.

You have expressed your opinion time and again about the need to stop this pain and return the kidnapped. Now more than ever, a sharp and clear public statement is needed that will say: 'All other things will stand aside, the return of the hostages is the main thing, this is the most important task now. We must use every possible means to ensure that no kidnapped person is left there. They cannot survive there any longer.'' Levine said the health of the hostages is a serious concern. 'Their health is deteriorating and they may not survive the upcoming winter. They do not have the reserves of the previous winter, they are all fragile and humanitarian cases. Despite all the challenges and threats, hope has not died. I was privileged to accompany Alma Avraham, after months of intensive care she is walking, recovering and getting better. As soon as the hostages reach us, we will know how to treat them, but for that they need to come here. The only cure is the return of all the abductees.' Yehene added that the hostages also are at a high risk of suicide. 'They can lose hope that they will be saved,' she explained. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjkhux8vkl	2024-12-10T09:00:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/10/HJfRB3rEkx/HJfRB3rEkx_59_54_740_416_0_small.jpg

ISIS has executed 54 soldiers from the army of ousted dictator Bashar Assad in Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based Assad regime opposition group, which said the executions were carried out in the Homs area and that the soldiers were captured by the jihadist terrorist organization after they tried to flee Syria.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjz3bglnkg	2024-12-10T08:10:17-08:00

Netanyahu at defense HQ: 'Interested in relations with new Syrian...	Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the situation in Syria, saying at the defense headquarters in Tel Aviv that 'we have no intention of interfering in its internal affairs, but we clearly intend to do what is necessary to ensure our security. Netanyahu added: 'Within this framework, I authorized the Air Force to bomb strategic military capabilities left behind by the Syrian army, so that they would not fall into the hands of the jihadists. This is similar to what the British Air Force did when it bombed the fleet of the Vichy regime, which collaborated with the Nazis, so that it would not fall into the hands of the Nazis.' Netanyahu said that Israel wants 'relations with the new regime in Syria. But if this regime allows Iran to reestablish itself in Syria, or allows the transfer of Iranian weapons or any other weapons to Hezbollah, or attacks us - we will respond forcefully and we will exact a heavy price from it. What happened to the previous regime will also happen to this regime.' 18:41	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1wjegu4jl	2024-12-10T08:02:48-08:00	
UN envoy warns against sending refugees back to Syria too soon	Following the fall of the Assad regime, European countries rush to stop the waves of Syrian refugees as an act of repatriation, which the UN envoy opposes The U.N. special envoy for Syria said on Tuesday that European nations should not rush to repatriate Syrian refugees following the fall of Bashar Assad's regime, and he urged foreign players, including Israel, not to intervene militarily. Syria remained in disorder three days after Assad's overthrow, with conflict continuing in the northeast and Israel bombing targets and expanding its buffer zone inside the country. 'The situation in Syria is still fluid,' Norwegian diplomat Geir Pedersen told a news conference at the United Nations' Geneva headquarters. While many Syrians were eager to return home, 'there are livelihood challenges still. The humanitarian situation is disastrous. The economy has collapsed.' News of Assad's fall prompted politicians in several European countries to call for a pause to the processing of asylum applications or even for the repatriation of refugees from 13 years of conflict. '(Going back) is something many, many Syrians are hoping for, but let's makes sure the international community is helping them in this process,' he said. Israel's campaign of bombarding military installations in Syria - something it says is essential to its security - 'needs to stop,' Pedersen said. 'It is extremely important that we don't see any action from any international actor that destroys the possibility for this transformation in Syria to take place.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Syria's transitional arrangements also needed to be as inclusive as possible, involving the broadest possible spectrum of Syrian society, or risk further conflict erupting, he added. To that end, the international community should be 'realistic' about the terrorist designation of the HTS rebel group that toppled Assad. 'It is now nine years since that resolution (declaring HTS's predecessor a terrorist group) was adopted,' he said. 'The reality is so far that HTS and also the other armed groups have been sending good messages to the Syrian people ... of unity, of inclusiveness.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sybg8j8ejl	2024-12-10T07:57:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2015/04/01/5970359/5970359_0_463_4288_2414_0_small.jpg
Israel ranks at bottom in reading and math for OECD countries	In literacy for adults ages 16 to 65, Israel ranks 27th out of 31 OECD countries, and in math at 26th; Data shows disparity between Jews and Arabs, with the gap in favor of Jews widening considerably A cause for concern: Israel is at the bottom of the OECD countries in reading and math. This is according to data published on Tuesday by the Central Bureau of Statistics and refers to the years 2022-2023. In reading literacy, Israel's average score is 244 compared to the OECD average of 260, and it was ranked 27th among the 31 countries that participated in the survey. Israel's score is similar to Italy. The data also shows that Israel is on a downward trajectory. Israel's score fell by 10 points compared to the first data cycle, which was conducted about a decade ago (2014-2015), and is mainly affected by the increase in the share of those with a low level of proficiency. Math does not look good either. Israel's average score is 246 compared to the OECD average of 263, and it was ranked 26th. The CBS found that Israel's score was similar to that of Italy, Lithuania and the United States. There was no significant change in Israel's score compared to the previous cycle. In adaptive problem solving, Israel's average score is 236 compared to the OECD average of 251, and it was ranked 25th. Israel's score is similar to Portugal, Croatia and South Korea. This is the first time that this skill has been measured in the survey. The Skills Survey is an international survey conducted by the OECD for the second time, and 31 countries participated in it. The survey examines the level of proficiency of adults (ages 16 to 65) in three basic skills: reading, mathematics and adaptive problem-solving. The CBS explains that these skills are considered extremely important for integration into the professional world and functioning as citizens in contemporary society. The survey directly measures the level of mastery of the skills and the way they are used at work and in everyday life. These skills are relevant to many contexts and situations in the world of work and in social life, and can be learned, so they can be influenced through policy. These skills give those who master them a good chance of making the most of the opportunities in today's information-rich society, while those who do not master them may be 'left behind.' The data also shows that a high proportion of the adult population in Israel has low levels of basic skills. The proportion of the population at low levels of reading literacy is 36%, compared to only 26% for the OECD average. The proportion at low reading levels in Israel increased from 27% in the first cycle. The proportion of the population at low levels of mathematical literacy is 34%, compared to only 25% for the OECD average. The proportion in Israel increased from 31% in the first cycle. In addition, the proportion of the population at low levels in adaptive problem solving is 40%, compared to the OECD average of only 30%. In the three measured categories, a large gap was seen between Jews and Arabs, similar to the first cycle. The Arab population saw a significant decrease of 26 points in reading literacy (from 225 to 199). In contrast, the Jewish population did not change, and its score remained similar to the OECD average (259 and 260, respectively). As a result, the gap in favor of the Jews widened from 39 points in the first cycle to 60 points in the current cycle. The data show that 70% of the Arab population has a low level of reading literacy. This is a significant increase compared to 46% in the previous cycle. The rate among Jews is only 25%. There was no change in mathematical literacy in either of the two population groups compared to the first cycle. The average score of the Jews (256) remains significantly higher than that of the Arabs (215). Also in adaptive problem solving, the average score among Arabs (206) is considerably lower than the score among Jews (247). The CBS also found that the ultra-Orthodox have lower achievements than other Jews, and their achievements have decreased compared to the first cycle. The average reading literacy score in the ultra-Orthodox population (251) is lower than the score among non-ultra-Orthodox Jews (261). Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In contrast, in the first cycle there was no gap between the two groups. In a comparison between men and women in the ultra-Orthodox population in reading literacy, there was a 12-point advantage for women, while in the first cycle there was no gap between them. The mathematical literacy score in the ultra-Orthodox population (246) is lower than the score among non-ultra-Orthodox Jews (258). On the other hand, in the first cycle there was no gap between the two groups, similar to reading literacy. However, the gap in favor of non-ultra-Orthodox exists only among men and was significant (21 points). Among women, there is no difference between ultra-Orthodox and non-ultra-Orthodox Jewish women. In adaptive problem solving, the trend is similar to that in the other two skills: an advantage in favor of non-ultra-Orthodox, especially among men. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1aumk841x	2024-12-10T07:48:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2016/05/15/7004868/7004868_0_81_1000_563_0_small.jpg

Trump’s close ties to Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and defacto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, drew heavy criticism after the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi The Trump Organization said it has leased its brand to two new real estate projects in Saudi Arabia just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House. It will partner with Dar Global, a London-based luxury real estate developer that will lease the Trump brand but fully own and develop the projects in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. The two have partnered on other projects in the region, including the development of a golf resort in neighboring Oman. 'Following the remarkable success of Trump International Oman, as well as our most recent ventures in Dubai and Jeddah, we are thrilled to announce two additional projects in Riyadh,' Eric Trump, the president-elect’s son who oversees the company’s real estate interests, said in a statement released on Monday.

Satellite imagery show that Russian naval ships have left Moscow's base at Tartous on Syria's coast and some have dropped anchor offshore following the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad by rebel forces. An image taken on Dec. 9 by Planet Labs showed at least three vessels in Russiaâ's Mediterranean fleet, including two guided missile frigates and an oiler, moored around 13 km (eight miles) northwest of Tartous. The rest of the fleet could not be immediately located in satellite imagery. In Moscow, Russia's defense ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Since Syrian rebels seized the capital Damascus on Sunday, Moscow, which was an ally of the Assad regime for decades, is now scrambling to make a deal with the rebels to guarantee the safety of two strategically important military bases. Russia has a major air base in the coastal city of Latakia and its naval facility at Tartous. The Tartous base is Russia's only Mediterranean repair and replenishment hub, and Moscow has used Syria as a staging post to fly its military contractors in and out of Africa. Previously, Russia had five surface ships and one submarine at Tartous, according to an analysis of satellite imagery by BlackSky and Planet Labs. An image taken on Dec. 5 by BlackSky showed all six vessels at the base. The Dec. 9 satellite images confirm earlier reports by Russian war blogger Ryba that the warships had left Tartous and taken up position off the coast for security reasons.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syojvcbvyg	2024-12-10T06:04:38-08:00

Optimistic message from Egypt: Hostage deal is 'very close'	Egyptian official tells Ynet that announcement of an agreement leading to a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is imminent; Source says that an Israeli delegation is set to arrive in Cairo this week and will receive from Hamas a list of living hostages; Hamas has made it clear: 'The chances of a deal are better than ever' After a senior Israeli official said on Monday that it would be possible to reach a hostage deal 'within a week or two ,' a senior Egyptian official also told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth on Tuesday that the announcement of an agreement that would lead to a cease-fire and a hostage deal is 'very close.' A Hamas delegation led by senior Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya left Cairo on Sunday night, following discussions with Egyptian intelligence chief Major General Hassan Mahmoud Rashad and his team. It was learned yesterday that the delegation had handed over to the Egyptians a detailed list of Israeli hostages - including the sick and elderly, women and men - that Hamas proposes to release in the first phase. The Hamas delegation also handed over a detailed list of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons that Hamas demands to be released as part of the new deal. The Egyptian official clarified that an Israeli delegation is scheduled to leave for Cairo this week for a meeting at the intelligence headquarters, during which they will be given the lists of hostages and Palestinian prisoners. Hamas made it clear to Egypt that 'there is a better chance than ever before of closing a deal,' in exchange for the release of the prisoners and Israel's withdrawal from the Philadelphi corridor and other areas in the Gaza Strip. The Al-Araby channel and the Al-Jazeera network in Qatar reported that, in talks in the Egyptian intelligence offices, an understanding was reached between Egypt and Hamas regarding the places from which the IDF will withdraw in Gaza, and that a week after the withdrawal, a cease-fire will be declared and the round of releasing Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners will begin. Israel, the Egyptian source clarified, will first withdraw from Rafah and areas to be determined in advance along the Philadelphi Corridor. Meanwhile, Qatar's Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari commented on the progress in the negotiations, saying that his country had renewed contacts with Hamas and Israel 'in good faith' as part of the mediation toward a cease-fire in Gaza. 'We are open to any path that leads to an agreement, we have not given up on mediation,' he said. 'Negotiations are continuing and it is too early to talk about developments.' On Monday, an Israeli senior official estimated in an interview with Ynet that 'within a week or two' it would be possible to reach a hostage deal, and said that 'the conditions are ripe.' At the same time, sources close to a senior Hamas official said Monday that there had been significant progress in talks for a deal. According to the same sources, the terrorist organization agreed to a gradual cessation of the war, and to a deal that is divided into three stages and includes a gradual withdrawal. According to the proposed deal, they said, between the sixth and eighth weeks of the cease-fire, IDF forces will withdraw from the Rafah Crossing and from city centers, after which negotiations will begin for a permanent cease-fire and the release of the kidnapped soldiers. Hamas, the insiders claimed, has handed Egypt a list of the living Israeli hostages - and is waiting for Israeli agreements regarding the list of Palestinian prisoners it requested, which also includes high-security prisoners 60 'trial days', Presence in Gaza during the cease-fire An Egyptian official explained last week to Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth that the new proposal put forward by Cairo includes a gradual cessation of fighting in Gaza, with the Israeli side withdrawing from the Rafah Crossing, in parallel with the declaration of a temporary cease-fire for about 60 days. He emphasized that the first 60 days would be designated as 'trial days' for both sides - Israel and Hamas - and that, if the plan holds up, it would be 'the end of the conflict between the sides.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: About a week after the temporary cease-fire comes into effect, according to the Egyptian official, the process of returning surviving Israeli hostages will begin. At the same time, hundreds of Palestinian terrorists also will be released from Israeli prisons, according to terms to be agreed upon between the parties. During the 60-day trial cease-fire, Israel will maintain a military presence in Gaza. The proposal also addresses the possibility of Palestinian refugees returning to the northern Gaza Strip, as Hamas demands. As for the Rafah Crossing, according to the plan it is expected to be transferred to the management and supervision of the Palestinian Authority. In previous contacts, Israel raised the possibility of maintaining a certain surveillance capability through cameras at the Rafah Crossing. In addition, according to the senior Egyptian source, a joint management committee from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip will be established, which will include between 10 and 15 'independent Palestinian political technocrats.' The committee will be supervised by American representatives. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by6osarnjg	2024-12-10T05:38:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/27/BJPNZehlye/BJPNZehlye_0_9_853_480_0_small.jpg

Syrian rebels swear to take revenge after freeing Assad prisoners	Rebel leader says will come after officials in Assad's regime and accuses them of war crimes after prisons holding his opposers are emptied, and they show signs of torture and abuse Efforts to form a new government in Syria continued on Tuesday following the historic overthrow of Bashar Assad’s regime and the end of the civil war that began in 2011, culminating in a resounding victory for rebel forces. Meanwhile, with the revelation of further evidence pointing to the regime's brutality against its opponents, the leader of the organization responsible for Assad's downfall has vowed to punish 'war criminals.' Syrian rebels told AFP on Monday that they found around 40 bodies with signs of torture in the morgue of a hospital located in a Damascus suburb. According to AFP, the bodies were placed in numbered sacks, with some labeled with the victims' names. AFP also reported that the morgue contained recently murdered victims alongside human remains. 'I opened the door of the morgue with my own hands, it was a horrific sight: About 40 bodies were piled up showing signs of gruesome torture,' a Syrian told the news outlet. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) leader Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, who led the regime's overthrow, said the rebels intend to hold Assad regime officials accountable. 'We will not hesitate to hold accountable the criminals, murderers, security officers and army officers involved in torturing the Syrian people. We will pursue war criminals and ask for their hand over from the countries to which they fled,' he said. 'We will offer rewards to anyone who provides information about senior army and security officers involved in war crimes. We have affirmed our commitment to tolerance for those whose hands are not stained with the blood of the Syrian people, and we have granted amnesty to those who were in compulsory service,' he added. Lebanese newspaper Nida' el-Watan on Monday reported that senior Assad regime officials, including some of his relatives, fled to Beirut under Hezbollah's protection. The report, citing 'senior security sources,' noted that among them was Ali Mamlouk, Assad's former national security adviser and head of the Syrian intelligence agency. The report added Assad himself received political asylum in Russia, where his wife and children are also located. Al-Jolani met with the toppled regime’s prime minister Mohammed al-Jalali to advance the establishment of an interim government and is set to meet Mohammed al-Bashir, who has been appointed to lead the government, on Tuesday. 'We are in the process of transferring executive authority to the interim government,' Al-Jalali said on Monday. 'We'll assist Prime Minister Mohammed al-Bashir in managing the next phase.' 'The government leading this transition has a plan and an understanding of the country's challenges. Our goal is to preserve Syria's state institutions and employees. The new administration seeks to build relations with neighboring countries,' he added. Meanwhile, banks in Damascus reopened for the first time since the regime's fall on Tuesday – a significant step toward a return to normalcy. Businesses in the capital also reopened. Released after 38 years in Assad’s prison The symbol of Assad's regime's cruelty is Sednaya Prison, located near Damascus. Rebels stormed the prison and freed inmates as they stormed the capital on Sunday. Videos published by Arab media showed the shocked prisoners cheering. Assad regime opponents called Sednaya a 'slaughterhouse,' where countless regime opponents — ranging from armed rebel fighters to peaceful protestors and dissenting military personnel — were sent since the uprising began in 2011. According to a 2017 Amnesty International report, up to 13,000 regime opponents were hanged in the prison between 2011 and 2015. The Associated Press reported that dozens of prisoners were freed from the prison on Sunday, but many remain unaccounted for. Over the past two days, thousands of Syrians have gathered outside the prison, hoping for news of loved ones who were sent there or disappeared during the war. Prisoners described how families waited anxiously for word of survivors, while frantic efforts inside the prison sought to locate hidden underground cells. However the White Helmets aid organization announced on Tuesday that searches in the prison concluded without any findings. The organization deployed five expert teams, including specialists in locating and rescuing individuals, wall breaching and accessing fortified doors, as well as search dogs and medical personnel. The organization said they 'found no hidden areas in the facility,' adding, 'We share the profound disappointment of the families of the thousands who remain missing and whose fates are unknown.' White Helmets Director Raed al-Saleh said on Monday that prisoners held in Sednaya endured 'hell': '[Sednaya] doesn’t give the impression that it is a prison. It is a human slaughterhouse where human beings are being slaughtered and tortured.'

Pope, growing critical of Israel, to meet Palestinian Authority p...	Pope Francis will meet Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Thursday, the Vatican said, as the Catholic pontiff has become more vocal in his criticism of Israel's military campaign in Gaza. Abbas travels to Italy this week, where he is expected also to meet with Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. The Vatican announced the meeting with Abbas in a brief note on Tuesday, but did not offer further details. In November, Francis suggested the global community should study whether Israel's campaign in Gaza constitutes a genocide of the Palestinian people. The comment, in a forthcoming book, drew a public rebuke from Israel's ambassador to the Holy See. Francis and Abbas have met several times, and are last known to have spoken on the phone in November 2023, a month into the Israel-Hamas conflict. The pope, as leader of the 1.4-billion-member Catholic Church, is usually careful about taking sides in conflicts, but has recently been more outspoken about Israel's campaign. He has also criticized Israel's airstrikes in Lebanon, where it is fighting Hezbollah, as 'beyond morality.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1fr11phekg	2024-12-10T04:27:34-08:00

IDF demolishes Syrian navy in Latakia	While officials emphasize security measures international reactions range from condemnation by Arab states to cautious support from the US The Israeli Navy carried out a significant operation on Monday night, targeting and destroying much of the Syrian regime’s naval fleet. Missile ships struck numerous vessels armed with anti-ship missiles at the Al-Baida and Latakia ports, aiming to prevent these weapons from falling into the hands of hostile entities such as the salafist rebels who have taken over Syria. At the same time, reports from Reuters and Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese network Al-Mayadeen indicated that IDF units crossed the buffer zone and advanced deep into Syrian territory, a claim the IDF denied. According to regional and Syrian security sources, Israeli forces are now positioned approximately 15.5 miles from Damascus, with some units reaching the town of Qatana, about 6.2 miles inside Syria, east of the buffer zone. Al-Mayadeen further claimed IDF troops had taken control of at least nine villages and towns in rural areas south of Damascus, approximately 12 miles from the Syrian capital. However, these claims were denied by a Syrian opposition-affiliated channel, which stated that Israel does not control villages in the Syrian Hermon region. 'Israeli warplanes launched over 100 strikes... including on the Barzeh scientific research centre,' the UK based Observatory for Human Rights said. Western countries including the United States struck the facility in 2018, saying it was related to Syria's 'chemical weapons infrastructure'. In response to the reports, IDF Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee dismissed them as 'completely false,' asserting IDF units remain within the buffer zone, stationed at defensive positions near the border to safeguard Israel’s security. Meanwhile, AFP reported that a 'scientific research center' in Damascus, tied to Bashar al-Assad’s chemical weapons program, was completely destroyed by Israeli airstrikes. Additionally, the pro-Iranian Iraqi-affiliated Sabrin news agency reported that a chemist was assassinated at his home in Damascus. During a UN Security Council meeting, Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon defended Israel’s actions, describing them as 'limited and temporary measures.' 'Israel is not interfering in the ongoing conflict between armed groups within Syria. Our actions are solely focused on ensuring our security, and we remain committed to the 1974 disengagement agreement,' he stated. Foreign Minister Gideon Saar told journalist in a briefing to the foreign media on Monday that the IDF operations near the border were designed to prevent a scenario similar to the events of October 7 from Syria. 'What guides us is safeguarding the security of Israel and its citizens,' Sa’ar said in a briefing to foreign journalists. The reported movement of IDF armored forces has drawn international condemnation. Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry accused Israel of 'destroying Syria’s chance to restore security,' while Egypt referred to the operations as an 'occupation of Syrian lands.' In contrast, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller described the Israeli actions as a 'temporary measure' in response to Syrian military movements, adding, 'Ultimately, we want to see full adherence to the disengagement agreement, and we will ensure Israel follows through.' IDF continues forward defense operations in the buffer zone, deploying forces across strategic points to counter potential threats. This comes a day after the beginning of proactive measures to secure Israeli communities in the Golan Heights amid Assad’s regime collapse. Engineering, infantry, and armored units are also operating under the command of the 474th and 810th Brigades, stationed along the Israel-Syria border to defend the area.

Air Force commando units captured the summit, which provides critical observation and fire control over the rest of the Hermon range, as part of a broader strategy to strengthen Israel’s hold in the region. Additionally, residents in five Syrian villages near the border were instructed to remain indoors due to IDF operations. The Israeli Air Force has carried out over 300 airstrikes on military targets across Syria, primarily focusing on Syrian Air Force infrastructure. Western intelligence sources indicate these strikes aim to destroy Assad’s military assets, preventing them from falling into the hands of rebel forces who could potentially use them against Israel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkwb00cb41e	2024-12-10T03:35:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/10/BkewMHqrE1l/BkewMHqrE1l_336_331_2280_1284_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu says criminal trial is politically motivated, press aga...	Prime minister testifies as court begins to hear the defense against bribery, fraud and breach of trust; claims he would not have been indicted had his views been left-leaning; rejects he sought favors from benefactors Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was wrongly indicted because he was the leader of Israel's right-wing that his opponents sought to depose. The prime minister took the stand on Tuesday to testify in his defense in his criminal trial for three counts of corruption including bribery, fraud and breach of trust. If I were holding left-wing views, I would not have been suspected of criminal offenses or indicted, Netanyahu said after his defense council Amit Haddad argued that the prosecution was politically motivated. Netanyahu criticized the decision of the judges' panel for refusing to reduce the days he is to testify each week, after they rejected his attempts to delay his testimony. 'I am leading a country at war on seven fronts,' he said. 'A tectonic shift not seen in a century has occurred. That demands balancing the needs of the trial, which I recognize, and the needs of the country.' In response to a general question from Hadadd, Netanyahu recounted the many challenges he faced as prime minister in the years he was alleged to have committed crimes of corruption, including having to deal with the American administration under then president Barak Obama who wanted him to stop building in the West Bank settlements and tried to convince him to leave security of the West Bank in the hands of the Palestinian Authority. He spoke at length about the hostile media coverage that he received and still receives and said his efforts in engaging with publishers of leading media outlets – part of which was considered illegal and the basis of some of the charges against him, was to bring about more diversity in the Israeli media which he said was primarily left-leaning. Netanyahu is accused of providing his co-defendant Shaul Elovich with considerable business advantage for his Bezeq communictions company in exchange for more favorable coverage on Elovich's Walla news site. According to the charges, Netanyahu or his wife were in daily contact with Elovich and Walla executives to promote favorable stories or limit unfavorable coverage. Netanyahu said he was too busy to enjoy the amenities he was accused of accepting from benefactors, also among the charges he faces in his criminal trial. In on of the counts, he is accused of accepting valuable gifts and a steady supply of expensive cigars and Champaign from movie mogul Arnon Milchan. 'I work 17, 18-hour days and eat lunch at my desk. I occasionally enjoy a good cigar but never manage to spoke it entirely because I am interrupted by my work,' he said. 'I hate Champaign,' he added Netanyahu's testimony was the opening of the defense's presentation in the trial that has already been underway for four years. He will testify for the defense and then face cross examination by the prosecution. He was not forced to testify and chose to do so to improve his chances of acquittal but has tried repeatedly to delay his testimony citing the needs of the war. Since he told the Supreme Court that the criminal proceedings against him would not prevent him from carrying out the duties of prime minister and was therefore spared from having to recuse himself for the duration of the trial, that argument came with some risk.

Israeli project takes on challenges for parents with disabilities	Designer Dana Yahya and former Paralympic swimmer Erel Halevi talk about new initiative providing solutions for parents with disabilities in Israel since the October 7 attack The ongoing war in Gaza has left hundreds of young Israelis with new disabilities, many of them at an age when they are starting a family or raising young children. For them, and for thousands of other Israelis with disabilities, the question 'How can I take care of my children?' becomes a complex daily challenge. The answer to this challenge is provided by TOM - Tikkun Olam Makers, an Israeli-American initiative that has become a global movement operating in 35 countries, that develops innovative, accessible and affordable solutions for the needs of people with disabilities. Erel Halevi, a 33-year-old former Paralympic swimmer, is a living example of the ability of technology to change lives. A year and a half ago, when her eldest son Ron was born, she encountered a challenge that seemed insurmountable at the time. 'I've been walking with crutches since I was 11 and when Ron was born I realized that I had no way of handling the stroller,' she says. 'I wanted to go on walks like every mother, but how is that possible when you need both hands for the crutches?' The solution came in the form of a unique harness developed for her at TOM. 'We worked together on the development,' says Erel. 'The harness connects to the waist and allows me to push the stroller with my body’s movements, while my hands are free for the crutches. It simply changed my life.' 'For almost 16 years I represented Israel in competitions, including three Paralympic games,' she adds, 'Today I want to help others find the solutions that will allow them to live a full life despite, and with, their disabilities.' 'Every person should dream, and every person should believe that this dream is able to be realized', said Dana Yichye Shwachman, the head designer of TOM. 'When it comes to being a parent, it's not just a dream - it's a basic right.' Dana speaks from personal experience. She grew up in the 1980s with a wheelchair-bound father, at a time when the word 'accessibility' was almost foreign in Israel. 'I personally experienced the meaning of inaccessibility,' she shares, 'the frustration when my father could not take care of me himself.' What is the answer that the project gives to parents with disabilities? Dana: 'We develop solutions that allow them complete independence in caring for their children. For example, we took an IKEA crib and added a sliding opening mechanism with automatic locking, which allows a parent in a wheelchair to access the baby easily and safely.' 'Solutions that cost 80% less' The project, founded in 2014 by the Israeli-American entrepreneur Gidi Grinstein, who currently serves as the president of the project, is based on two central principles: open-source, and user participation in the development process. 'I don't think that those who use our products are people who have difficulty raising children,' emphasizes Dana. 'It is more likely that they simply do not have an environment that is adapted to their abilities. That is why our solutions are available to everyone - there is no intellectual property, everything belongs to the global community, and anyone can download the designs and manufacture the products themselves.' And what about the prices? 'We work with the Frugal Innovation approach, and use simple tools and available materials. The result is solutions that cost 80% to 99% less than market prices.' 'I don't think that those who use our products are people who have difficulty raising children,' emphasizes Dana. 'It is more likely that they simply do not have an environment that is adapted to their abilities. That is why our solutions are available to everyone - there is no intellectual property, everything belongs to the global community, and anyone can download the designs and manufacture the products themselves.' As part of the project's expansion of activities, Grinstein notes that TOM developed a unique university program. 'We operate in 57 leading universities in the world, training students to lead maker activities for the development and manufacturing of solutions on campus. This is an excellent way to reach young talent and harness them to our goal.' Students from Shenkar College and the Holon Institute of Technology HIT have already developed solutions that have gained international recognition. Among other things, they developed a unique safety belt that allows a parent in a wheelchair to sit a child on their lap safely - a solution that won the 'Community Award' in the 2023 TOM Global Innovation Challenge. A look to the future As a result of the ongoing war, the necessity of the project is re-validated. According to Grinstein, since October 7, 2023, communities of engineers and designers have been recruited to respond to the wounded soldiers of the IDF, in cooperation with the Rehabilitation Division and the Ministry of Defense, as well as hospitals and rehabilitation centers in Israel. The recognition of this activity was manifested in winning the prestigious Zero Project Award for 2025, which will be awarded this March in Vienna together with 77 other organizations from 45 countries. 'This is a great opportunity to present Israeli activities to the world,' Grinstein emphasizes. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: With over 2,200 active volunteers, of which 750 are in Israel, the project continues to grow. 'We already have about a thousand solutions in development,' concludes Dana, 'from solutions for everyday needs such as eating and drinking - to sports and music. 'All solutions are available for free download on the website, and there is also the option of seeking help from the project's volunteer community, which also appears on the website. It is not only about Technology - it's about the basic right of every person to live independently and with dignity.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/b1w1mpnvye	2024-12-10T02:19:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/05/B14pqlJ4Je/B14pqlJ4Je_361_81_1452_817_0_small.jpg

Ministers, lawmakers show up to support Netanyahu at his criminal...	PM's coalition allies bemoan the ongoing legal proceedings as politically motivated and harmful to Israel’s security, while opposition voices highlight the stark contrast with the plight of hostage families Cabinet ministers and lawmakers, including the Knesset speaker came to support Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Tel Aviv District Court on Tuesday when he began testifying in his defense in his criminal trial for corruption. This marks the first time in Israel’s history that a sitting prime minister has testified as a defendant. Before beginning his testimony, Netanyahu shook hands with politicians and other supporters who came to stand by him. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir attacked Atorny General Gali Baharav-Miara as he has been doing in the past year. 'I expect all ministers—whether present here or not—to bring to the next cabinet meeting a proposal to consider her removal,' he said, accusing her of 'fabricating cases' to bring down the right-wing government. Transportation Minister Miri Regev and Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi made a point to walk through the pro-Netanyahu demonstrators outside the courthouse. Regev emphasized her support for the prime minister. 'I am here to strengthen and support Netanyahu. It’s disgraceful that he is forced to testify during one of the most complex wars Israel has faced, a war imposed on us on seven fronts,' she said. 'A prime minister on the witness stand during wartime, in an attempt to humiliate and degrade him, is a blow to the country’s security. Who does this spectacle serve? Iran, Syria, Lebanon. And then people ask why public trust in the judiciary is eroding. This is why—because people see selective enforcement, because they see a political witch hunt against Netanyahu. I regret this situation, but it will not help anyone. We will continue to lead.' Karhi echoed the sane sentiments. 'The leaks and threats aim to bring us down—not just the prime minister, but all of us.' When asked by Ynet why he chose to attend the hearing instead of focusing on efforts to free the Israeli hostages held in Gaza, Karhi responded: 'Ask the prosecutors why they insist on holding three days of testimony a week instead of letting the prime minister focus on what matters now—hostages, the war, Lebanon, Gaza, Syria.' When pressed to comment on the criticism from families of hostages, who have called on Netanyahu to prioritize their plight over his trial, Karhi said: 'I think their call is important—to ask the judges and prosecutors to allow the prime minister to manage the war efficiently, instead of taking up his time three days a week.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Justice Minister Yariv Levin also commented on Netanyahu’s testimony, calling it a moment of profound injustice. 'It’s hard not to feel a deep sense of injustice this morning, seeing these proceedings continue against Netanyahu after years of legal harassment—and especially during these critical days when so much rests on his shoulders,' Levin said. 'Along with many Israeli citizens, I want to express my support for him. I know that today, too, he will stand tall and present the plain truth as it is.' Outside the court house the families of hostages held a vigil carrying pictures of Ron Arad, an air force navigator who was shot down over Lebanon in 1986 and has not been seen since soon after he was captured. They said they feared the same fate would befall their loved ones after being held by Hamas for over 430 days since the Oct. 7 massacre and after they accused the prime minister of refusing to make a deal that would bring about their release. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjw4pfh41g	2024-12-10T01:39:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/10/SJaIO00rEJl/SJaIO00rEJl_138_109_1115_628_0_small.jpg

Bereaved daughter establishes healing center for war victims	Shira Mark, who lost her father to a terror attack, brother to accident and younger brother in Gaza, says she wants to choose life and aid those who need it despite the pain The story of the Mark family is a chilling and unfathomable chain of losses, yet also a testament to the resilience of the human spirit to rise from grief. Shira Mark, who found herself taking on the role of an older sister and maternal figure to her younger siblings at a young age, is now establishing the 'Michael Center' in the Golan Heights — a recovery and healing center for those affected by war. The first tragedy struck the family eight and a half years ago when her father, Rabbi Michael (Miki) Mark, was murdered in a shooting attack in the southern Hebron Hills in the West Bank. Terrorists opened fire on the family vehicle, leaving Shira’s mother, Chava, critically injured, while two of her younger siblings, Pdaya and Tehila, were also wounded. Rabbi Mark, the head of a yeshiva in the settlement of Otniel and a central figure in the community, left behind a wife and ten children. In 2019, less than three years after her father's murder, Shira lost her older brother Shlomi. A former company commander in the Givati Brigade’s Shaked Battalion who continued into a career in the Shin Bet, Shlomi had been an anchor in Shira's life. He died in a motorcycle accident during his service. With the outbreak of the Gaza war, the family endured another blow. Their beloved cousin, Elchanan Kalmanson, fell during a heroic battle in Kibbutz Be'eri. Elchanan, an expert in urban defense and counterterrorism, worked tirelessly for 14 hours rescuing trapped residents in the kibbutz. Alongside his brother Menachem and nephew Itiel, a former team commander in the IDF Combat Engineering Corops’ Yahalom unit, they used an armored jeep to go house-to-house, saving civilians based on cries for help. Among others, they rescued a young girl hiding in a closet after her parents were murdered. Their efforts saved over 100 kibbutz residents before Elchanan was fatally shot by terrorists. Then came yet another devastating loss. Shira's younger foster brother, Pdaya, was killed in December 2023 during operational activity in Gaza. Lieutenant Pdaya Menachem Mark, a combat soldier in Givati's reconnaissance unit, was just 22 years old when he fell alongside seven of his comrades. Upon hearing of his cousin Elchanan's death, Pdaya refused to leave his soldiers to attend the funeral. He hadn’t returned home since the war began. 'Pdaya waited to serve in the IDF his whole life,' his sister Orit said. 'He always loved the land and family was everything to him.' Shira added, 'His bravery in battle was extraordinary, but Pdaya was a hero in everyday life as well, ever since the horrific attack that took our father and left our mother injured.' 'Pdaya managed to live a life full of meaning, resilience, and strength,' she recounted. 'Despite this third loss in our family, I don’t feel we’re defeated. This is a victory because Pdaya fought out of love, not hate.' From the depths of unimaginable pain and loss, Shira Mark has chosen life and aid for others. The 'Michael Center,' to be established in the Golan Heights, aims to provide a refuge for war victims — soldiers, women, men and children. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Named after her father, the center will stand as a living testament to the power of the human spirit to transcend pain and transform it into a source of hope and healing for others. 'I reach out to you with an open heart and a life story woven with pain and loss but also with hope and growth,' Shira said. 'Despite all the loss and hardship, I wholeheartedly believe in the power of healing and the possibility of living a life of hope and love.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hk54qe4ekg	2024-12-10T00:20:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2016/07/03/7109813/7109813_1_0_980_551_0_small.jpg
West Coast antisemitism: Israeli struck in California vehicular a...	A suspected hit-and-run in California leaves an Israeli-American injured, a yeshiva student stabbed in Brooklyn, and reports of over 10,000 antisemitic incidents in the US highlight a disturbing surge in hate crimes amid the Israel-Hamas conflict A night out turned violent for Roi Gross, a 28-year-old Israeli-American. While leaving a nightclub in Laguna Beach, California, Gross and three friends became involved in an altercation with two men who, according to reports, identified themselves as being of 'Palestinian-Iranian' descent. What started as a verbal clash reportedly escalated into accusations against Israel and criticism of the war in Gaza. The situation took a dangerous turn when one of the suspects allegedly got into his car, accelerated toward Gross and his group, and struck two of them. Gross suffered a broken leg and was taken to the hospital, where he underwent surgery and is awaiting another operation. Authorities have arrested several individuals connected to the incident, including one of Gross’s friends. Laguna Beach police are treating the case as a potential antisemitic hate crime and have vowed to hold those responsible accountable. 'This is the first time I’ve experienced such violence,' Gross, a former IDF soldier who moved to the United States in 2014, said. 'We tried to avoid confrontation, but the suspect acted maliciously, with clear intent to harm.' Yeshiva student stabbed in Crown Heights, Brooklyn In a separate incident, a yeshiva student in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights neighborhood was stabbed in the neck and transported to a hospital in moderate but stable condition. The attack occurred near a well-known community event hall, and the suspect fled the scene immediately afterward. Police are working with local volunteers to track down the perpetrator, using security footage that shows the suspect, described as a young white male. The local 'Shomrim' organization stated that the stabbing stemmed from a personal dispute between the victim and the suspect, who is reportedly known to the community from prior incidents. They emphasized that the attack is not being treated as an act of terrorism or a hate crime. Investigations into the motive and circumstances are ongoing. Antisemitism surges to record levels amid Israel-Hamas conflict The first year of the Israel-Hamas conflict has seen a disturbing spike in antisemitic incidents across the United States. According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), over 10,000 antisemitic incidents were recorded between October 7, 2023, and early September 2024, marking the highest number ever documented in a single year since the ADL began tracking such incidents in 1979.

This dramatic surge reflects the heightened tensions and divisions spurred by the ongoing conflict, with Jewish individuals and institutions increasingly targeted by violence and hostility. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk7xjoheyl	2024-12-10T00:19:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/10/rkeKE2rrNJe/rkeKE2rrNJe_0_239_570_321_0_small.jpg

Blame game in Iran after the fall of ally Assad's regime, report	IRGC official says Quds force commander watched from Tehran as Iranian allies fall; says no one in Iran expected Assad to flee leaving their assets compromised A 'blame game' is unfolding in Tehran, according to an official in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Crops (IRGC) on Tuesday, after the fall of the Assad regime and what appears to be the collapse of the Iranian axis established to spread the influence of Iran in the Middle East. An Iranian official told the British Telegraph newspaper that no one could have envisioned Assad fleeing Syria after the efforts of the past decade to keep him in power, not because he was much loved in Tehran but because the Iranians wanted to be close to Hezbollah and the Israeli border. Iran had invested millions of dollars in the support of Assad's regime after it intervened in the Syrian civil war. But Assad fled his country shortly before the rebels reached Damascus after their surprise uprising that began when the cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, Iran's main proxy, came into effect. The official who spoke to the Telegraph said that Iran needed someone on the ground to receive arms, but everyone had either been killed or escaped. Now, he said the Iranians are trying to understand what was happening and how dangerous the situation was for Iran. He said some of the blame is being directed at Esmail Qaani, the commander of the IRGC Qudz force for allowing the Syrian military to dissipate as it had done but no one dares tell him to his face that he must assume responsibility. He did nothing to prevent Iran's interests to dissolve. Iran's allies have fallen one after the other as he sat watching from Tehran, he said, warning that worse days were ahead. Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei was expected to speak publicly on Wednesday about the recent developments. His office said Iran hoped to continue the 'friendly' relations with Syria. But behind the scenes, Tehran is in crisis. The IRGC official said there are rumors that Qaani would be replaced. After the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah by Israel in August, the Quds Force commander dropped out of sight for a time and the word on the streets was that he was being investigated. He said Khamenei summoned senior commanders of the IRGC a number of times in recent days, as the Syrian rebels advanced and that there were heated discussions and concerns about what Iran must tell its supporters.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r15vjtrvyg	2024-12-09T23:51:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/27/SJUcbqsxke/SJUcbqsxke_0_0_2168_1220_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu begins testifying in his defense against charges of cor...	Prime minister set to take the stand in court for the first time after his attempts at delaying his appearance were overruled by judges in his case Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared at the Tel Aviv District Court on Tuesday to begin his testimony in his corruption trial. Netanyahu was indicted for bribery, fraud and breach of trust on three counts. This is the first time in Israel's history, a sitting prime minister has testified in his own criminal trial — the testimony expected to last no less than two months. Netanyahu arrived at the court house while ministers in his cabinet, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and lawmakers from his coalition gathered to support him. His son Avner was there as well. Protesters gathered outside the court including families of hostages held in Gaza who accused Netanyahu of delaying the release of their loved ones from captivity for political reasons. Following 120 prosecution witnesses, the defense phase in Netanyahu’s 'Case 1000, 2000 and 4000' trials begins with Netanyahu's testimony — a pivotal moment, as the prosecution's cross-examination will be crucial in determining the case's outcome. Netanyahu will take the stand from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., and unusually, on Wednesday from 2:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. Netanyahu has submitted four requests to the judges in the past month — asking for delays, reduction of testimony days and schedule changes — alongside petitions from Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana and Security Cabinet members. A petition to the High Court seeking to declare Netanyahu incapacitated during his testimony was also dismissed. Amid threats against his life and attempts to alter the testimony's format, Netanyahu's testimony will take place in a secure underground hall in the Tel Aviv District Court, despite the trial being held thus far in the Jerusalem District Court, as required by law for indictments against a sitting prime minister. Last week, the Shin Bet recommended moving the testimony to Tel Aviv for security reasons. The defense phase will begin with Netanyahu’s testimony followed by defense witnesses chosen by his legal team. The first day of testimony will open with a speech by Netanyahu's attorney, Amit Hadad, mirroring the opening statement by lead prosecutor Liat Ben-Ari during the prosecution phase. After Netanyahu’s defense witnesses, testimony will proceed with the other defendants: Yedioth Ahronoth and Ynet publisher Arnon Mozes in Case 2000 and Shaul Elovitch in Case 4000, each presenting their own defense witnesses. As with any witness, Netanyahu’s testimony will have two parts: direct examination by his attorney, featuring open-ended questions to align with the defense's strategy and cross-examination by Tel Aviv district attorney for tax and finance prosecutor Yehudit Tirosh for Case 4000 and her deputy Jonathan Tadmor for Cases 1000 and 2000. Unlike the prosecution, which must notify the defense of its witnesses immediately after filing the indictment, the defense has no such obligation. However, it’s customary for the defense to inform the prosecution of its witnesses shortly before their testimony. The defense has yet to disclose its witnesses but previously indicated plans to summon former Police Internal Investigations Unit heads Uri Carmel and Dovi Scherzer, Likud MK Moshe Saada and former Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit to address the issue of the AG's approvals for launching investigations into the prime minister. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Typically, prosecutors involved in a case don’t testify, and Mandelblit’s summon would require court approval if called on. In a press conference held last night — his first in 99 days — Netanyahu addressed his upcoming testimony. 'I've heard the media claim I want to evade the trial,' he said. 'Evade? What nonsense. For eight years, I've been waiting for this day — waiting to present the truth, waiting to completely dismantle the absurd and baseless accusations against me, waiting to expose the 'witch hunt' method once and for all.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy74twsvkg	2024-12-09T22:50:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/18/HkzYmNAdzyl/HkzYmNAdzyl_325_238_851_479_0_small.jpg

Top Assad regime officials find refuge in Beirut's finest hotels	Senior members of the deposed Syrian regime in Lebanon after fleeing to Hezbollah’s protection as rebel forces approached Damascus; coordinated escapes, bribes, and secret crossings highlight the regime’s collapse Fleeing what might have been a far more gruesome fate, senior Syrian officials and members of former President Bashar Assad’s family have reportedly sought refuge in Beirut, cloaked under the protective umbrella of Hezbollah. According to Lebanese newspaper Nidaa al-Watan, the high-ranking defectors, including intelligence officers and business elites, are now holed up in luxury hotels across the Lebanese capital, with Hezbollah and Lebanese security forces ensuring their safety. Among the notable figures is Ali Mamlouk, Assad’s former national security advisor and head of Syrian intelligence, who is no stranger to controversy. Convicted of terrorism by Lebanon for his alleged involvement in the bombing of two mosques in Tripoli, Mamlouk is said to be hiding in a five-star Beirut hotel. Meanwhile, Assad himself has reportedly fled to Russia, where he has been granted political asylum by President Vladimir Putin. The Lebanese report delves into the shadowy logistics of this escape. Assad’s associates, including intelligence operatives and businessmen, began their exodus just days before Damascus fell to rebel forces. The operation, meticulously coordinated by Hezbollah and a senior Lebanese border official linked to Mamlouk, involved crossing the Syrian-Lebanese border through both legal and illicit routes. To avoid detection, Hezbollah operatives swapped Syrian license plates for Lebanese ones. Notable among those who fled are Assad’s cousins, Mamlouk’s mother (who is married to Assad’s uncle), and Khaled Qaddour, a businessman with close ties to Assad’s brother, Maher. These individuals reportedly paid hefty bribes—amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars—to Lebanese security officials to secure their passage. Now, they remain under heavy Hezbollah protection in Beirut, with Lebanese security forces patrolling the perimeters of their hideouts. While Assad’s inner circle retreats to Beirut, the dictator himself appears to have found sanctuary in Moscow. Russian officials confirmed his arrival in the capital along with his wife Asma and their three children—Hafez (24), Zein (22), and Karim (21). Yet, the Kremlin remains tight-lipped about his exact location. When asked about Assad’s presence in Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov tersely replied, 'I have nothing to say on the matter,' adding that no meeting between Putin and Assad has been scheduled. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The dictator’s flight to Russia raises significant questions about his future. Reports suggest that Assad and his wife possess a vast fortune, estimated at $2 billion, spread across offshore accounts, shell companies, tax havens, and global real estate ventures. This financial cushion likely ensures the family’s continued access to substantial funds, even as their political fortunes have clearly been decimated. As Assad’s regime crumbled in the face of rebel forces, the fallout from this exodus underscores the intricate interplay of geopolitics in the region. While Beirut shelters key regime figures, Moscow offers Assad an escape route—a stark reminder of the shifting allegiances and power dynamics in the Syrian conflict. For now, the world watches as the Assad regime’s remnants scatter, leaving behind a legacy of destruction and uncertainty. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rydb1drejx	2024-12-09T22:21:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/08/SygM8gXJyg/SygM8gXJyg_186_407_2319_1306_0_small.jpg

From hate to dialogue: Afghan, Pakistani Diaspora leaders discove...	Nearly a dozen leaders from the South Asian diaspora met with Israeli counterparts as part of a person-to-person peacebuilding effort Growing up in Afghanistan, Ehsanullah Amiri was taught to hate Israel. 'I heard a lot of bad things about Israel, a lot of politically motivated propaganda by clerics, tribal leaders,' Amiri, a journalist who moved to Canada three years ago to escape the Taliban, said. Since his childhood, much has changed for Amiri. Following the October 7 massacre, Amiri wrote many articles in Canada's National Post defending Israel’s right to protect itself. Those articles earned him a wave of hate mail and harsh responses — from his own community as well as Islamists in Canada. Amiri’s experience with Islamic extremists piqued his interest in understanding the October 7 attack and Israel’s fight against terrorism. As a member of Afghanistan’s Hazara minority, he hoped to learn from Israelis how to stand firm against terror groups. So when a friend told Amiri about Sharaka, a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting peace between Israel and the Arab world, he was curious, and he agreed to join a delegation visiting Israel for a week. 'I wanted to get to know Israel, the Jewish people, the nation and build bridges,' Amiri said. 'We have a lot of wars in the region and in the world. Why not make peace?' Sharaka’s mission to Israel this month brought nearly a dozen South Asian leaders together with their Israeli counterparts. The mission was designed to help participants collaborate on projects to influence communities in Israel, America, Pakistan and beyond. The delegation visited several sites in Jerusalem’s Old City, received a briefing at the Knesset, toured the Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum, visited southern Israel, and met with October 7 survivors, among other stops. Dan Feferman, executive director of Sharaka, said that citizens of countries critical of Israel are increasingly interested in seeing another side of the story. 'Sharaka’s ongoing work in bringing impactful delegations from the Abraham Accords countries and beyond shows the appetite for such bridge-building programs in the region,' he said. Noam Meirov, Sharaka’s managing director, said that the Islamic diaspora is 'very influential' in shaping events in the Middle East and in Western countries that Muslims have relocated to. He described two camps of Muslims in the U.S.: one representing a radical stream of Islam and another supporting a more moderate form of the religion. The moderate camp believes in peace with Israel, even if it is sometimes critical of the Jewish state, Meirov said. He said that Sharaka’s focus is on empowering moderate Muslims and providing them with accurate information about Israel and tools to stand up for Israel. 'We saw that through engaging people to people, creating programs, studying about the Holocaust, [and] studying about radicalism in Israel [and] in the Arab countries, we found mutual allies in more countries,' Meirov said. He said that Sharaka has succeeded in shifting the narrative from a struggle between Jews and Arabs to a struggle between moderates and extremists. Mubashir Ali Zaidi was another participant in the mission. A Pakistani journalist and writer now living in the UץSץ, he grew up amid anti-Israel sentiment much as Amiri did. 'They teach us that [Jews] are our enemy and Jews are not good people,' he said. 'You are taught that you can travel anywhere in the world except to Israel.' Upon moving to the United States, Zaidi befriended members of the American Jewish community and quickly realized his perceptions were wrong. After October 7, Zaidi wrote that Israel should wipe out Hamas once and for all 'because otherwise there will be no peace.' That stance drew backlash from religious leaders in Pakistan who attacked him on social media. 'I thought I should go and find out the other side of [the] story, see what Israelis think,' Zaidi explained. He assumed he would have to wait until he obtained an American passport, but Sharaka was able to arrange entry using his Pakistani documents. Zaidi described himself as neither pro-Israel nor pro-Palestinian. With more than 100,000 followers on Facebook and more than 15,000 YouTube subscribers, he said his goal was to understand the complete picture in order to share with his audience. 'I cannot convert people. I cannot convince more people, but I can tell them a story, and maybe 5 out of 100 people will think, okay, so we should study more, we should learn more about Israel, and maybe we were wrong,' he said. Hina Akhtar also took part in the Sharaka trip. In Pakistan, Akhtar was a teacher, and since moving to Israel, she has worked in health care, serving patients from diverse backgrounds. She said her goal was to foster awareness and empathy about Israel and Jewish history. 'My dad was a progressive Muslim, and he never stopped me from asking questions,' she said. For decades, Akhtar felt uneasy when she thought about the hatred between different sects of Islam. After the October 7 attacks, that same feeling of unease resurfaced. 'If we are all the children of Abraham, why are they hurting each other? What is the reason?' she recalled thinking. She also wondered why Muslims are 'tagged as a violent nation.' She joined the trip to try to find answers to those questions, help other Muslims challenge their misconceptions about Jews, and bear witness to the reality in Israel, she said. 'I always thought there has to be another side of the story which is not being portrayed in the media,' Akhtar said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: While in Israel, Akhtar attended a Shabbat dinner at the house of a Sharaka leader. She described being struck by the parallels between Jewish and Muslim traditions and prayers.

'I am definitely going to take this forward.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bkgodlhvyl	2024-12-09T21:36:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/28/SyOJk3SRR/SyOJk3SRR_0_225_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

The strikes targeted airports and warehouses, complete Russian Mig and Sukhoi fighter squadrons, radars, military signal stations, and multiple weapons and ammunition depots.

Should Israel take Syrian territory?	Jonathan Schanzer warns of 'dangerous' consequences Israel should be cautious about taking territory in Syria, as it risks embroiling the Jewish state in another war, according to Dr. Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president for research at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. 'Taking territory could be … dangerous,' he told ILTV News. 'The reason why is that it could be used as a casus belli by the Sunni jihadis to say, look, the Israelis are now occupying territory that should have been Syrian, at least by their calculus, and they may use that as a reason to wage war against Israel.' However, Schanzer noted that if Sunni jihadis are present on the other side of the buffer zone, it makes sense for Israel to deploy forces there and ensure sufficient defenses to prevent any invasion by these groups. Israel has been targeting chemical and advanced weapons facilities in Syria to prevent such weapons from falling into the hands of Sunni jihadis. Schanzer described this approach as entirely logical. 'You have some of those advanced weapon assembly plants that Iran had created inside Syria, IRGC facilities. Some of those have apparently been destroyed as well,' he said. 'We're talking about precision-guided munitions that are apparently being destroyed by the IDF.' When asked whether Israel should celebrate the fall of Syrian President Bashar Al Assad and the prospects of a new regime, Schanzer urged caution. The groups that overthrew Assad are linked to Al Qaeda and backed by Qatar and Turkey, known sponsors of groups like Hamas and ISIS. 'We're not looking at particularly moderate actors here,' Schanzer explained. 'On the one hand, we have the departure of the Assad regime, which has been associated with Iran and its axis, as it's known across the region, and it has been a regime that has helped Hezbollah arm up with Iranian weapons. That's gone. That's a positive. But now what we have in his place is a Sunni jihadi vacuum of sorts.' He emphasized that for now, all the U.S. and Israel can do is signal to the rebels and their backers that 'we’re watching carefully and that there will be repercussions if the jihadis turn their sights on either Israel or the Kurds, two of America's most valuable allies in Syria.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1phoshnye	2024-12-09T19:53:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/r1D00YA4N1x/r1D00YA4N1x_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

‘People are still afraid’: Northern residents hesitate to return ...	ILTV heads North to the abandoned Israeli town of Metula About 10 days after a ceasefire was signed with the terrorist group Hezbollah, ending more than a year of cross-border violence, the people of northern Israel are beginning to return home. For the first time in months, more stores have opened in the local mall near Kiryat Shemona. Traffic on the roads has increased enough to cause slight delays, a small but noticeable sign of life returning to the region. These changes offered a welcome respite on Sunday after months of eerie silence during the conflict. When Hezbollah began firing rockets, the government evacuated more than 60,000 people from their homes along the northern border with Lebanon to minimize civilian casualties. Unlike southern Israel, which was attacked by Hamas on October 7, the north lacked sufficient bomb shelters to protect its residents. Now, 14 months later, the destruction in Israeli towns like Metula is extensive. Damage has been caused by Hezbollah rocket fire, IDF tanks and personnel who used the towns as bases, and by neglect, with homes overrun by rats and mold after more than a year of abandonment. Most residents remain hesitant to return, uncertain whether the 60-day ceasefire agreement will hold. In towns like Metula and Manara, located around six kilometers from the border, the prospect of moving back feels nearly impossible. ILTV visited Metula on Sunday and met 75-year-old resident Arie Almog. Almog and his partner were the only ones who remained in Metula after evacuation orders were issued. He told ILTV that while some neighbors have returned to assess the condition of their homes since the ceasefire, few, if any, have decided to move back full-time. 'People are still afraid from the situation, which is not very clear,' Almog said. 'I think if the government would make it more clear what exactly is going to happen then I think people would commit to come back as soon as possible. As long as people will not feel safe enough, I don’t think they will come back so quickly.' Last week, IDF Northern Command Chief Maj. Gen. Ori Goldin informed regional mayors that they could begin planning the rebuilding of their towns. However, residents have received little to no compensation for their losses, and the government has shown insufficient commitment to investing in the reconstruction of some communities. Still, Almog remains optimistic, saying he believes recovery is possible. 'I think they should take care of themselves as much as they can,' Almog said of his fellow residents. 'I think we will be able to collect outside money to help us recover this village that has been damaged quite a lot – some are really bad, some are not so bad. It can be repaired and rebuilt. It will take a lot of time, and I believe that the government will be able to give whatever possible. Don’t forget, we are at war for a year and two months now.' Over the past year, more than 8,000 rockets, drones, and anti-tank missiles were launched from Lebanon, killing 45 civilians. Another 76 IDF soldiers and reservists lost their lives in cross-border attacks and a ground operation in southern Lebanon that began in late September.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkmd11rse1e	2024-12-09T19:27:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/10/HyvwMSrVyg/HyvwMSrVyg_0_192_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Iranian analyst praises PM for dismantling Tehran’s regional influence, citing IDF strikes on Hamas, Hezbollah and Iranian proxies in Syria and Yemen; he criticizes US Democratic leaders, calling Netanyahu a confident and strategic leader As the Iranian regime grapples with the fallout of the Assad regime's collapse in Syria, an Iranian political analyst has offered a blunt assessment of what many in the Middle East and beyond have observed: the steady dismantling of Iran's so-called 'Axis of Resistance' under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Through calculated and sustained military operations, Netanyahu has directed the IDF to deliver crippling blows to Iran's regional network. These efforts have undermined Hamas in Gaza, inflicted severe damage on Hezbollah—long considered Tehran's most significant regional ally—and targeted Iranian interests in Syria and Yemen, including crushing blows to Iranian-backed Houthi forces.

In the same post, Garshasbi criticized U.S. Democratic administrations, praising Netanyahu for having 'poisoned the den of Uncle Obama and Aunt Kamala’s mafia,' a reference to prominent Democratic leaders.

Germany, UK, France say extremely concerned about Iran enrichment...	Germany, Britain and France said on Monday they were 'extremely concerned' about Iran's acceleration in its capacity for enrichment of uranium, urging Iran to halt and reverse these steps. Rafael Grossi, head of the UN nuclear watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told Reuters on Friday that Iran was accelerating its enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, approaching the level of about 90% that is weapons-grade. Germany, Britain and France, known informally as the E3, said in a joint statement they condemned Iran's latest steps to significantly increase the rate of production of uranium enriched up to 60% at the underground Fordow facility. 'We are also extremely concerned to learn that Iran has increased the number of centrifuges in use and started preparations to install additional enrichment infrastructure, further increasing Iranâ€™s enrichment capacity,' they said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj11e00esnkx	2024-12-09T14:08:42-08:00

Israel strikes Syrian air bases, strategic military targets as pr...	Arab media reports that, since Assad's fall, the IDF has been striking Syrian military targets; IDF says it is eliminating military assets such as chemical weapons production facility and air defense systems Israel continues to target Syrian military assets after the fall of the Assad regime throughout Syria, so that they will not pose a threat in the future. Arab media reported widespread attacks in various areas throughout Monday as the second day of attacks. The Saudi Al-Hadath channel reported that the Israeli Air Force has carried out more than 250 strikes in Syria in the past two days - about 100 of them in a few hours on Monday evening. According to Arab reports, Israel's attacks on Monday targeted fighter jet squadrons, airports, air defense batteries, weapons and ammunition depots, scientific research centers, and missile brigades in various provinces in Syria. Two Syrian security sources told Reuters that the IDF had attacked major air force bases across Syria and that infrastructure and dozens of helicopters and planes were destroyed during the attacks. Attacks in Damascus near scientific research center The Assad regime has developed various capabilities over the years with the support of Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. Now, with the rebels taking over, everything it had in its possession could fall into their hands and be directed against Israel. The rebel groups are diverse, and therefore chemical weapons, for example, falling into the wrong hands such as unpredictable extremist Sunni Islamic rebels could pose a serious risk. Arab media outlets reported Monday evening that Israel attacked the port in the city of Latakia, on the coast in northwestern Syria. According to the Saudi Al-Arabiya channel, the Syrian Navy ships were attacked. Security sources told the Reuters news agency that the attack was aimed at an air defense facility near the port. The Sabrin channel, affiliated with pro-Iranian militias in Iraq, reported that the port's defense system was destroyed in the attack. In Damascus, explosions reportedly were heard near the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center where, according to reports, Iran had previously operated to produce long-range missiles and where the Assad regime was suspected of producing chemical weapons. According to the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen network, the center was destroyed. On Monday, photos of the attacks against the airport in southwest Damascus on Sunday attributed to the IDF were published. Israel has previously attacked senior Iranian-Shiite figures at that location. The Saudi Al-Hadath channel reported that Israel attacked dozens of MiG-29 aircraft belonging to the Syrian army on Sunday night. On Monday evening, another airport in Damascus was reported to have been attacked - Al-Maruhiyat in the Aqraba area. According to Al-Mayadeen's report, Israel destroyed military helicopters and attacked the Damascus countryside. Airstrikes are defense against extreme scenarios On Sunday night, just after midnight, explosions were reported in the 12th Brigade and the 175th Battalion of the Syrian Army, near the city of Izra, after Israel attacked weapons depots. Later, an attack was reported in the Tel Haruf area. Meanwhile, after the IDF captured the Syrian Hermon on Sunday, the Syrian Voice of the Capital channel reported Israeli attacks in the mountainous area where the Syrian army's 4th Division operates, commanded by Assad's brother Maher Assad. The Syria TV channel, which is affiliated with the rebels, reported an attack against the 9th Division of the Syrian army on the 15th Brigade of the Syrian army. In addition, it was reported that military warehouses were attacked in the northern countryside. Israeli officials told the Wall Street Journal on Monday that the purpose of the airstrikes in Syria is to protect Israel's borders and citizens against extreme scenarios. For example, if the new Syrian government becomes hostile to Israel it might attack. Another possible scenario is that Syria would be dragged into a long-term civil war, during which rebel groups could gain access to unconventional weapons left behind by Assad's army. Tehran cuts off weapons and smuggling routes from Syria A day after the fall of the Assad regime, the IDF has identified that Iran is cutting off weapons and smuggling activists from Syria so that they can survive. At the same time, the IDF is attacking and preventing weapon transfers from Syria to Lebanon. The IDF has intensified additional forces with artillery and tanks in the Golan and the buffer zone, as well as in Syrian-controlled points near the border. The Syrian army has abandoned its posts in the Syrian Golan, and the IDF has seized the weapons remaining in them.

Living between worlds: A love story in sign language	Micha Koitni and Lola Adir’s love story defies stereotypes, blending sign language, resilience and advocacy; From Micha’s ultra-Orthodox upbringing to Lola’s journey through grief, their partnership inspires change, challenges stigmas and highlights the power of communication and acceptance Eight years have passed since Micha Koitni and Lola Adir first met at a sign language course held at the Silvia Bumper club, a meeting space for both deaf and hearing individuals. Even now, they speak of that encounter with heartfelt excitement. Born deaf to hearing parents in a Lithuanian ultra-Orthodox family, Micha’s world couldn’t have been more different from Lola’s, who grew up in the settlement of Alfei Menashe. Yet, the connection between their contrasting worlds has been a fascinating journey. 'I was a bit nervous when I arrived at the club,' Micha recalls. 'Suddenly, I saw this beautiful woman with long hair, a tattoo, drinking beer and signing fluently. A friend told me, ‘Go talk to her.’ I approached her, and now we’ve been together for eight years. It’s a great love.' 'We both came into the relationship as adults who knew what we wanted,' says Lola. 'I had just come out of two years where I didn’t want a relationship at all due to a personal crisis, partly following my father’s death. I felt ready for a fresh start.' How did your families react to your relationship? Lola: 'There wasn’t any real opposition, but at first, they asked if it would be hard for me or if I’d need to help him. Over time, they realized he doesn’t need help and that I’m not his caregiver. This is a great love like any other. Once you have a shared language, mutual care and a willingness to make things work, it really doesn’t matter what others say. Some questioned the challenges of such a relationship, but honestly, what relationship doesn’t have challenges and gaps to address?' 'We don’t need to prove our love; we love each other,' Micha adds. After eight years together, isn’t it time to talk about marriage? Lola: 'We’ve never been interested in a wedding ceremony. We’re registered as common-law partners, and that’s as married as it gets for us.' Micha, 43, a social activist and food blogger who creates sign language and subtitled content on social media, and Lola, 37 (whose official name is Ella Yael), produce accessible content and videos together and give a lecture called 'Talking with Hands.' In thh last week, they have shared their life story at a special event as part of the 'Please Touch: Art Beyond Limits' festival, which opens at the 'Please Touch' Center in Jaffa Port. The festival, which celebrates the International Day for Equal Opportunities for People with Disabilities, also featured appearances by notable figures such as Lior Ashkenazi, Dvir Benedek, Anat Atzmon, Daniel Salomon, Haim Be'er, Karni Postel, and Yoav Ginai. Childhood in silence Micha was born in Petah Tikva into a Lithuanian ultra-Orthodox family. His younger sister is also deaf. 'When I was six months old, my parents noticed I didn’t respond when they called me. They took me to Sheba Medical Center for a hearing test and discovered I was deaf,' he recalls. 'They were at a loss. They were told there were several options, including hearing aids and schools where deaf and hearing children study together.' 'I attended mixed kindergartens and schools, with both hearing and deaf students. Often, when the teacher turned to the board and spoke at the same time, I missed what was being said because I couldn’t read her lips. My classmates didn’t help me at all. I’d come home and review the material to catch up on what I’d missed in class.' In eighth grade, Micha moved to a yeshiva. 'We studied Torah from seven in the morning until 11 at night,' he says. 'There were about 500 hearing students, and I was the only deaf one. Since they knew I was deaf, they helped me.' At 27, Micha received a cochlear implant, thanks to his sister, who also had one. 'I was able to recognize sounds, but it didn’t make me hear like a person without hearing loss. Today, I can identify cars on the road, even voices, but fully understanding words is still difficult.' At some point, Micha felt he wasn’t progressing in his yeshiva studies and asked to leave. It took time to convince his parents. 'I started working under two conditions – first, that I’d work in a public job suitable for religious people, and second, that I’d finish work by 5 p.m. and continue studying Torah for two to three hours afterward.' What about matchmaking? 'In the yeshiva, everyone married at a very young age, and I was very jealous. The few matches I went on were complicated, and before every meeting, I was investigated thoroughly. In many cases, the match was rejected even before I met the girl. 'They would say I was an honest man, a good person, God-fearing, but that I had too many shortcomings– my father is Ashkenazi, my mother is Yemenite – in short, a mixed heritage. In the ultra-Orthodox world, Ashkenazis and Sephardic don’t mix in matchmaking. The fact that I’m deaf was also a disadvantage. It was only when I entered the working world that my perspective began to widen.' Were you disappointed? 'I came to terms with reality. All my siblings got married. When my younger brother wanted to get married, he had to ask for my permission because I’m the oldest. I told him, ‘Go ahead, don’t wait for me. Get married.’' 'I discovered life could be bright too' After leaving the yeshiva, Micha started working in a baby products store. 'On the way to work, I’d always sit in the back of the bus, so people wouldn’t notice my implant,' he recalls. 'One day, I noticed a fellow passenger making all sorts of hand movements. I was shocked. It was the first time I saw someone communicating in sign language.' How did you react? 'I approached him and asked, ‘Excuse me, what is this?’ He replied, ‘What, are you kidding me? It’s sign language.’ After he finished his conversation, we started talking openly. He explained what it was and began teaching me basic signs, like ‘good morning,’ ‘good evening,’ and ‘Shabbat Shalom.’' It surprised you that much? 'The religious world is very closed. I thought speech was all there was. I told my parents about it, and they told me not to use my hands to communicate. I asked why, and they replied, ‘What do you prefer – to communicate like a mime or like a normal person?’ ‘Of course like a normal person,’ I answered, and at that moment, I decided not to bring it up with them again.' The following day, Micha once again encountered the deaf man on the bus. This time, he sat next to him, and the man continued teaching him additional signs. 'I asked him where I could meet more deaf people,' Micha recalls. 'He immediately replied, 'Come to Yehud, there's a deaf soccer game there once a week.'' Micha followed his suggestion and arrived at the soccer field in Yehud, only to be taken aback by what awaited him. 'Everyone was speaking in sign language,' he remembers. 'I stared at them in shock, amazed that they understood each other without asking questions.' How did they react to you? 'I was the only religious person there. They looked at me and asked, 'Did you come here by mistake? Did you fall from the moon?'' When Micha returned home, he felt the need to examine himself and understand whether he was taking a risk with his actions. 'On Shabbat, I told my parents I was going to study Torah. I went to the yeshiva, hung up my suit, removed my kippah, and my heart was pounding,' he recounts with excitement, reflecting on the moments when he acted against the principles he had been raised with for 30 years. 'I quickly left the yeshiva, headed toward the intersection, and caught a sherut taxi, line 51, to Tel Aviv. The driver asked me, 'Are you getting in?' I checked to make sure no one familiar was watching me and got in. After all, the Torah says that someone who desecrates Shabbat is to be put to death. And here I was, sitting in a sherut taxi, realizing everything was fine. The doors closed, and I told the driver, 'Please drive, drive,' and he didn’t understand what I wanted from him. 'When we started driving, I felt someone tap me on the shoulder, and I panicked. I imagined my father had caught me red-handed. It turned out that one of the passengers was handing me five shekels to give to the driver,' he shares. 'When I got off the taxi in Tel Aviv, I was in shock. Suddenly, I discovered that life is actually bright and that people walk around the streets without worry. For 30 years, I hadn't felt good about myself. That was the moment I realized I didn’t want to go back.' On his way home, after getting off the return taxi to his city, Micha re-entered the yeshiva, put on his kippah, and donned the suit that had been waiting for him where he had left it. 'When I got home, everyone asked me, 'Why is your face red?'' he recalls. 'I remember panicking and thinking to myself: they'll throw stones at me if I tell the truth. 'I sat outside and read in the sun,' I quietly answered, and my parents responded, 'Good for you, we're proud of you.' I was both lying and had also ridden a taxi on Shabbat – and yet, I was still alive.' When did you tell your parents? 'A few weeks later. I approached them and said, 'If you thought I went out to study Torah, I'm sorry – I went out to hang out with friends. You know, I'm already 30 years old. I have a different life now, one that's different from the past, and I'm enjoying it.'' Lola: 'Among other ultra-Orthodox families, the connection would have been severed in such a case, and Micha expected that to happen with his family as well. But it didn’t.' Breaking stereotypes Lola was introduced to sign language during her military service as an educational soldier. 'In one of the programs where I taught children and teens with cerebral palsy, where some also had speech or hearing impairments, I began gathering information about sign language,' she shares. 'I had a plan that once I finished my service, I would study sign language professionally because the language fascinated me. Ten years later, I fulfilled that plan.' Why only a decade later? 'When I was 25, my father died after a long illness. That was a turning point for me, lasting three years. The decision to take this step was part of my effort to overcome that crisis. At the time, I was mainly working in hotels, with lots of night shifts and minimal interaction with people. When I decided I needed to get back on my feet, I returned to sign language, but this time I studied it seriously.' In their lectures, Lola and Micha aim to challenge common but misguided perceptions about deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals through personal stories and plenty of self-deprecating humor. 'Misunderstandings between deaf and hearing people are often very funny,' she says with a smile. 'One of the issues important to us and many other deaf social activists is erasing the stigma that a deaf person is pitiful and reliant on charity. You could say that deaf people begging for money give a bad name to the entire hard-of-hearing community,' she adds. 'Often, when people hear Micha speak, they think he has a cognitive or intellectual issue. But in the end, it's just his speech that’s different. Of course, beyond that, there are many changes that the state and public institutions still need to implement.' What changes, for example? 'We often encounter situations where service representatives call our home and insist on speaking with Micha to approve certain bureaucratic matters listed in his name. Or, when I speak to representatives from the bank or insurance company, they insist on talking to him as well. Every time, I have to explain again that he can’t talk on the phone and that I can identify myself on his behalf – he can’t. Today, there’s the option of video calls – why not use that technology for identification processes?' Are there enough interpreters in Israel today? 'There are between 200 and 300 interpreters, but more are needed. It’s important to remember that 20–30 years ago, awareness of sign language was very different from what it is today. Back then, doctors recommended teaching children to speak rather than use sign language. Today, some TV programs include interpreters, but unfortunately, not all of them do.' Their work in blogging about cooking and giving lectures fills their lives. 'When I lived with my parents, I didn’t know how to cook. The only two dishes I could make were toast and an omelet,' Micha shares. 'The kitchen was my mom’s special room. When Lola and I moved in together, I decided I wouldn’t order takeout and started cooking.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Lola: 'When we started living together, I didn’t eat meat. I told him, 'If you want to eat meat, you’ll have to cook it yourself.' Since I was diagnosed with cancer, and especially now with my health values being very poor, I have to eat meat. I decided my health is more important than anything else, and dealing with the illness is already overwhelming – so adding a dietitian’s menu on top of it? I preferred to avoid more bureaucracy.' Lola continues, 'Two months ago, I was hospitalized at Ichilov for two and a half weeks. Usually, when a deaf person arrives for treatment or a checkup, an interpreter accompanies them. This time, it was the opposite – I was the patient, Micha was the one accompanying me, and I had to both talk to the doctors and translate what they were saying to Micha.' During this time, new communication challenges emerged between them. 'When I was recovering after surgery, I had oxygen masks on and swollen hands, so I couldn’t sign or spell out words to him,' Lola explains. 'There were moments that later made us laugh – I meant to tell him I was thirsty, and he understood that I was happy. So, I grabbed his hand and started writing on it, and that’s how we communicated.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s1f8q6441x	2024-12-09T13:34:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/03/rJWhAI2mJl/rJWhAI2mJl_0_0_1619_1080_0_small.jpg

Assads acclimate to their new luxurious life in Russia	The fugitive Syrian dictator is believed to be in Moscow with his wife and three children, and is said to have more than $2 billion in assets; Meanwhile, Asma Assad battles cancer for the second time A day and a half after the overthrow of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria, Russia still refuses to provide information on his whereabouts. However, senior Russian government officials had already told local media that Assad landed in Moscow and had received political asylum with his family from President Vladimir Putin. When Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov was asked when the fugitive dictator arrived in Russia, he replied he had nothing to say on this matter and then said that, for now, no meeting with Assad has been scheduled for Putin. Assuming that the Assads are with Putin, they will now have to build a new life in Russia with a plan to live at the same level of luxury they did in Syria. According to estimates, Bashar Assad is currently in Russia with his wife Asma and their three children, Hafez, 24, Karim, 21, and Zain, 22. The British Daily Mail reported that the State Department estimates that Assad and his wife have a net worth of about $2 billion spread across several bank accounts, shell companies, tax havens and real estate ventures across the globe, so it is likely that they still have access to vast sums of money. In addition, the Daily Mail said that Assad's extended family owns at least 20 apartments in Moscow, worth up to nearly $40 million, adding that Assad's uncle, Mohammed Makhlouf, has purchased 18 luxury apartments in an exclusive complex in the Russian capital in the past decade, where ministers in the Russian government and wealthy Russian businessmen also live. The Assads may live in one of these apartments or in a secure location allocated by Putin. As Syrians took over Assad's palace in Damascus, they got a glimpse of the family's ostentatious lifestyle for the past 24 years during his rule, finding a fleet of luxury cars. Videos from the palace showed Syrian civilians and rebels wreaking havoc, looting, and setting parts of it on fire. During the past decade, reports have already sparked worldwide anger that Asma Assad, while her husband is slaughtering his own people, continues to spend a fortune on luxury goods such as handbags and clothes. The Assad family has long been familiar with Moscow, even if they have not lived there. The deposed president has visited multiple times to meet with Putin and other Russian officials. Hafez, Assad's eldest son, studied there at university and even wrote his thesis in Russian, and just last year Asma came there to attend his graduation ceremony. On the other hand, the move to Russia comes at a difficult time for the family, not only because of the humiliating escape from Syria. In May, Asma announced that she had been diagnosed with cancer again, this time leukemia, and that she would be required to quarantine and would be absent from events and activities. Her announcement came almost five years after she announced that she had recovered from breast cancer, which the Arab world followed closely. Some are now wondering what will happen to her treatments in Russia. Meanwhile, in Damascus, the feeling of euphoria following the overthrow of the regime continues despite the enormous challenges that await Syria in the near future and the fear of an all-out war between the rebel organizations that carried out the military coup. Syrian residents gathered in Umayyad Square, raised the Free Syria flag, and hugged each other. Drivers passing by the square honked their horns in celebration, and rebels deployed nearby fired shots in celebration. 'It’s indescribable, we never thought this nightmare would end, we were reborn,' said Reem Ramadan, a finance ministry employee who came to celebrate in the square. 'For 55 years we were afraid to speak, even at home, we used to say that the walls have ears. Now we feel like we’re living in a dream.' Life in Damascus has yet to return to normal. There was little traffic in several neighborhoods of the capital today, and many vendors refused to open their shops. Public institutions and schools also remained closed, and rebel forces deployed near the central bank. 'Thank God, we were liberated,' said 61-year-old Amr al-Dabbas, who arrived in Umayyad Square. 'Now we are waiting for things to slowly improve.' Still, no one knows who will rule Syria and what kind of regime they will lead. The force that appears to be the strongest at the moment is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist organization formerly known as Jabhat al-Nusra, an affiliate of al-Qaida in Syria. It has led the rebels on a campaign of conquests and victories over the past two weeks that has led to the fall of the regime, and its leader Abu Muhammad al-Julani entered Damascus on Sunday as a victor. Over the past week, al-Julani has made an effort to put on a moderate mask, but the West still views him with suspicion and wants to make sure that he does not seize the opportunity to establish an extremist Islamist regime in Syria. On Sunday, U.S. President Joe Biden said that although al-Julani's people are currently saying 'the right things,' they will be judged by their actions, not their statements. On Monday, Germany joined this statement, warning against excessive optimism. The German spokesman emphasized that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham will have to be supervised although having made efforts to distance itself from its jihadist origins and to establish civilian structures. In the meantime, Syrians continue to search for their loved ones in Saydnaya prison north of Damascus in secret cells where people are still supposedly being kept. On Sunday, Assad's opponents were seen trying to break down walls and doors, and on Monday they were joined by the White Helmets aid organization, including experts and sniffer dogs. In a post on X, the White Helmets announced that it would give a $3,000 reward to anyone who provides information that will directly lead to the discovery of hidden cells in the prison. The organization promised anonymity for former prison personnel and security forces if they provide it with the necessary information. The White Helmets asked prisoners' families searching for their loved ones not to dig through the prisons themselves, as this could damage the physical evidence needed to bring the fallen regime's criminals to justice. The Saydnaya prison, located about 30 kilometers north of Damascus, is considered by many to be one of the main symbols of the Assad regime's oppression. This prison, which opponents of the regime have described as a 'human slaughterhouse,' has been used to house thousands of regime opponents since 2011, including armed members of the rebel organizations, non-violent protest activists and military personnel suspected of opposing Assad.

Qatar opens contacts with Syrian rebel group HTS, source says	Qatari diplomats spoke with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) on Monday, an official briefed on the developments told Reuters, as regional states race to open contact with Syria's leading rebel faction after its rapid offensive toppled Bashar al-Assad. Qatar plans to speak with HTS leader Mohamed Al-Bashir on Tuesday, the day after he was appointed to lead Syria's transitional administration, the official said. Governments across the region are scrambling to forge new links with HTS and other rebel groups involved in the offensive that seized control of much of Syria in the Middle East's biggest upheaval in generations. Assad fled to Russia, after 13 years of civil war and more than 50 years of his family's rule. Qatar's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters requests for comment about the contacts with HTS, a group formerly allied with Al Qaida and which is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., European Union, Turkey and the U.N. Assad's main regional ally Iran also opened a direct line of communication with rebels in Syria's new leadership, a senior Iranian official told Reuters, citing the need to 'prevent a hostile trajectory' between the countries. It was not clear if Iran's contacts were with HTS or another Syrian rebel faction.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hygalanvyg	2024-12-09T11:20:38-08:00

Europe scrambles to freeze Syrian asylum applications following A...	As Assad regime collapses, European nations move to freeze Syrian asylum applications amid uncertainty; Refugees rejoice at the prospect of returning, while far-right movements seize the moment to demand stricter immigration policies and reassessments of residency permits Millions of Syrians were displaced during the civil war that erupted in 2011. Now, following the resounding defeat of Bashar al-Assad and the collapse of his regime, countries that took in Syrian refugees are questioning how many will voluntarily return home and whether it is still justified to approve asylum requests for those whose cases remain unresolved. Several European countries announced on Monday evening that they are halting the processing of asylum applications for Syrians within their borders, awaiting greater clarity on Syria's situation under rebel control. In 2015, during Europe’s migration crisis, over one million Syrians arrived on the continent. Most sought refuge in Germany, where nearly one million Syrians still reside almost a decade later. In light of recent developments in Syria and the end of the war, Germany announced that its Federal Office for Migration and Refugees is suspending the review of asylum applications until further notice. According to the German news agency DPA, this decision will affect approximately 47,000 pending asylum requests from Syrians. 'I want to return to my country and help rebuild it' German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the review of asylum requests from Syrians currently residing in Germany will depend on developments in Syria. 'At this stage, it is impossible to determine a concrete possibility for returning to the country. In such a volatile situation, it would be unprofessional to speculate,' she said. 'The fall of Assad’s brutal dictatorship is a great relief for many who endured torture, murde and terror,' Faeser added. 'For many refugees who found safety in Germany, there is finally hope to return to their homeland and rebuild their country.' Thousands of Syrians celebrated Assad’s fall in Berlin on Sunday. 'Like many Syrians, I want to return to my country and help rebuild it,' said Bassam, a social worker who arrived in Germany in early 2016. Sabrine, a 36-year-old architect, shared her intention to assist her homeland from Germany: 'What Syria needs most is money and expertise. We can gather all of that from here for now.' The migration crisis has deeply divided European Union member states in recent years and fueled the rise of far-right movements across the continent. In Germany, for instance, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has gained significant popularity with its anti-immigration stance and criticism of government policies. Now, following the end of Syria’s war, the party has warned of another wave of Syrian refugees attempting to enter Germany. 'The borders are closed; we are not prepared to accept more,' party leader Alice Weidel declared. Many Syrians who reached Europe also settled in neighboring Austria, where close to 100,000 Syrians currently live. Like Germany, Austria’s government announced it is freezing the processing of Syrian asylum requests. Since the start of the year, 12,871 asylum applications have been submitted. Austria’s Interior Ministry stated that Chancellor Karl Nehammer instructed Interior Minister Gerhard Karner to suspend asylum processing and review all previously approved applications. According to the chancellor, Syria’s security situation must be evaluated to determine whether deportations are feasible. Karner added that he has directed officials 'to prepare a plan for organized returns and deportations to Syria.' Sweden joins the freeze, as far-right calls for a review of residency permits After Germany, Sweden has accepted the second-largest number of Syrian refugees in Europe. In 2015 alone, more than 50,000 Syrian asylum seekers arrived, and today nearly 200,000 Syrians live in the country. By evening, Swedish authorities announced they would suspend the review of asylum applications and deportations to Syria. 'Given the current situation, it is difficult to assess the grounds for protection at this time,' said Carl Bexelius of the Swedish Migration Agency. In recent years, Sweden has tightened its immigration policies. The far-right Sweden Democrats party called today for a reassessment of residency permits granted to Syrian refugees in recent years. In Stockholm, as in other European cities, Syrian refugees gathered on Sunday to celebrate the end of Assad’s rule. 'Destructive Islamist forces are behind the regime change in Syria,' claimed party leader Jimmie Åkesson. 'I see groups here in Sweden celebrating these developments. They should see this as an opportunity to return home. New circumstances require new evaluations. That’s why it’s important to reassess the residency permits of those who left Syria for Sweden.' Denmark, the UK, and Greece pause applications; France to decide soon A senior Greek government official told Reuters today that the country will stop processing asylum applications for approximately 9,000 Syrians. Bloomberg reported this evening that the UK (no longer an EU member) has joined the list of European nations halting decisions on Syrian asylum requests. Denmark and Norway have also decided to freeze the processing of Syrian asylum applications. Denmark’s refugee agency explained that the decision was made 'due to the uncertainty in Syria following Assad’s regime collapse.' Currently, the agency is handling 69 applications. In the summer of 2020, Denmark became the first EU country to reassess residency permits for Syrian refugees, stating the situation in Syria had changed and no longer justified granting or extending residency permits. However, Denmark has yet to execute any deportations. Norway’s announcement emphasized that the situation in Syria remains 'unclear and unresolved.' Since the start of the year, 1,933 Syrians have applied for asylum in Norway. In France, the government announced this evening that it also plans to suspend the processing of asylum requests soon. The French Interior Ministry said a decision on the matter would be made within hours. At Turkey’s border: 'Everyone will return, no one will stay' Turkey has hosted the largest number of Syrian refugees worldwide, with over three million Syrians currently residing in the country. In Istanbul and other cities, the Syrian community celebrated Assad’s downfall, with the opposition flag raised at the Syrian Consulate building in Istanbul on Sunday. Hosting such a large refugee population has strained Turkey in recent years, creating economic challenges and sparking tensions between Ankara and the European Union. Now, Turkey hopes most Syrians will voluntarily return home without government intervention. 'We will continue our efforts to ensure Syrians return to their homeland safely and willingly,' said Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. Hundreds of Syrian refugees gathered today at two border crossings in southern Turkey, awaiting the moment they could cross back into Syria. 'Assad shot at us, murdered us. Now I’m going back to Syria,' said Mohammad, 28, who fled Damascus in 2016 and has been living in Istanbul ever since. 'Thank God, the war is over.'

He, too, arrived at the Turkey-Syria border, ready to return home. 'We are so happy. Everyone will return; no one will stay here,' he said. Zakaria, 31, who arrived in Turkey in 2019, is also waiting at the border with his wife and two children to return to Aleppo. He hopes to rebuild his home, destroyed during the war. 'We came here because of the war. Now it’s over, and we’re going back.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkeytsnvkl	2024-12-09T11:10:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/rJeSx0KNNJl/rJeSx0KNNJl_458_190_2345_1321_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu: 'The absolute victory they mocked is at hand'	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convenes a press conference for the first time in 99 days and declares 'The Golan will forever be an inseparable part of Israel'; He also claims that 'collapse of the Syrian regime is direct result of severe blows we have inflicted on Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a press conference in Jerusalem on Monday evening on the eve of his trial that begins on Tuesday. This is the first press conference Netanyahu has held since September, and he has not answered questions for 99 days. The press conference came about 24 hours after the fall of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria, after which the IDF captured the Syrian Mount Hermon. 'Yesterday something happened, literally. The Assad regime in Syria, a central link in Iran's axis of evil, collapsed. Iran invested billions in Syria. It was a cruel tyrannical regime that trampled on its citizens and massacred them,' Netanyahu said at the beginning of his remarks. He thanked U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights in 2019, and emphasized: 'The Golan will forever be an inseparable part of Israel.' According to him, 'the collapse of the Syrian regime is a direct result of the severe blows we have inflicted on Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran.' Netanyahu said that the assassinated Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah was 'the axis of the axis,' noting that he 'not only focused the fire against him, he was the axis linking Hezbollah, Syria and Iran. His elimination was a turning point in the collapse of the Iranian axis.' The prime minister said that after the collapse of the Assad regime 'we want to see a different Syria. We proved this at the beginning of the civil war when we built a field hospital, which treated thousands of wounded Syrians.' Netanyahu met with reporters amid reports of progress in negotiations for a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. According to a report Monday in the Hamas-affiliated Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, the parties have begun to detail the implementation of the hostage and prisoner exchange agreement. 'The parties are serious about reaching an agreement,' a source described as 'reliable' told the Qatari newspaper. The prime minister visited near the Syrian border on Sunday and referred to the fall of Assad: 'This is a historic day in the history of the Middle East. The Assad regime is a central link in Iran's axis of evil. This regime has fallen. This is a direct result of the blows we inflicted on Iran and Hezbollah, the main supporters of the Assad regime. This has created a chain reaction throughout the Middle East of all those who want to be free from this oppressive and tyrannical regime.' He said, 'This of course creates new, very important opportunities for the State of Israel. But not without risks. We are working first and foremost to protect our border. This area was defined for nearly 50 years as a buffer zone that was agreed upon in 1974, the Separation of Forces Agreement. This agreement collapsed, and the Syrian soldiers abandoned their positions.'

Italy pauses asylum applications from Syria	Italy's government on Monday said it would pause asylum applications from Syria, a statement said, following similar moves from European neighbors after the fall of Syrian president Bashar Assad. 'The government decided, similarly to other European partners, to suspend proceedings on asylum applications from Syria,' the statement said after a meeting between government chief Giorgia Meloni and some ministers on Syria. Other European countries, including Germany, put asylum applications from Syrians on hold until further notice while France said it hoped to announce a similar decision shortly.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1qp86nekl	2024-12-09T10:37:13-08:00

Israel cautiously optimistic for hostage deal within 'a week or t...	Talks on a potential hostage deal – ramped up by Qatar, Egypt and Turkey – are intensifying, with Hamas reportedly agreeing to phased cease-fire terms; Israel remains cautious, demanding hostages' return before halting military operations A senior Israeli official suggested on Monday evening, during a conversation with Ynet, that conditions are aligning for a potential Hamas hostage deal within 'a week or two.' While the Prime Minister's Office sought to temper expectations earlier in the day, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar struck a more hopeful tone, stating: 'We’re not there yet, but I hope we’ll get there.' Parallel reports from sources close to a senior Hamas official indicated significant strides in negotiations. They believe Hamas has tentatively agreed to a phased cessation of hostilities, with a proposed deal unfolding in three stages. This framework includes a gradual Israeli withdrawal, with Israeli forces expected to pull back from Rafah and urban centers between the sixth and eighth weeks of a cease-fire. Following this, talks for a permanent truce and the release of Israeli hostages would commence. Hamas has reportedly provided Egypt with a list of Israeli hostages confirmed to be alive and is awaiting Israeli approval of its demands for the release of Palestinian prisoners, including high-profile detainees. These developments come as Jake Sullivan, the outgoing U.S. national security adviser, is set to arrive in Israel on Thursday. As first reported by Ynet, Sullivan will engage with Israeli officials on a range of pressing issues, including the cease-fire in Lebanon, escalating tensions in Syria, and the ongoing hostage negotiations in Gaza. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, addressing foreign journalists in Jerusalem, underscored Israel’s position: 'The hostages must return before Israel agrees to end the fighting. There will be no ceasefire in Gaza without a deal.' While acknowledging indirect negotiations are underway, Sa’ar cautioned against premature conclusions. 'I don’t want to say things that will harm the negotiations, but indirect negotiations are taking place. We can be more optimistic than before, but we’re not there yet. I hope we’ll get there. We are serious in our desire to reach a hostage deal, which will be tied to a cease-fire in Gaza. There will be no cease-fire in Gaza without a hostage deal. We are working to achieve this, and I hope we succeed,' he said. Meanwhile, Palestinian factions holding Israeli hostages in Gaza have reportedly been instructed by Hamas to prepare detailed files on their captives. According to Saudi channel Al-Sharq, Hamas has directed Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front, and the Popular Resistance Committees to compile information on the hostages under their control. A Hamas source told Al-Sharq that without an Israeli withdrawal and freedom of movement between northern and southern Gaza, reaching all groups holding hostages would be challenging. The source emphasized that a serious deal, free from ongoing bombings and military operations, is the only viable path to resolving the hostage crisis. Additionally, Hamas’ military wing and other factions require sufficient time, without drones overhead, to verify the status of living hostages and locate the remains of deceased captives. A senior Hamas official revealed that Egypt, Qatar and Turkey have intensified their mediation efforts, with indirect negotiations expected to begin within days. However, Israeli officials have downplayed these reports, and the Hostage Directorate in the Prime Minister’s Office issued a statement to families of the hostages: 'In recent hours, various reports have been published in the Arab media about negotiations for the return of the hostages. These reports, which are also being circulated in Israel, are not accurate.' Last week, a senior Egyptian official outlined a proposal to Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth that includes a gradual cessation of fighting in Gaza, coupled with an Israeli withdrawal from the Rafah crossing. This would coincide with a temporary cease-fire lasting approximately 60 days. The official described this period as a 'test phase' for both sides, noting that if the plan holds, it could signify 'the end of the conflict between the sides.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Under this proposal, about a week after the cease-fire begins, the process of returning Israeli hostages still alive would start. Simultaneously, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli jails, based on terms agreed upon by both parties. During the 60-day cease-fire, Israel would maintain a military presence in Gaza. The plan also addresses Hamas’ demand for the return of Palestinian refugees to northern Gaza. Regarding the Rafah Crossing, the proposal suggests transferring its management and oversight to the Palestinian Authority. In previous discussions, Israel floated the idea of retaining some level of surveillance through cameras at the crossing. Additionally, the Egyptian official mentioned the establishment of a joint management committee comprising representatives from the West Bank and Gaza, including 10 to 15 independent Palestinian technocrats. This committee would operate under the supervision of American representatives. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjmufcv4jl	2024-12-09T09:47:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/07/ryATF11Wk1x/ryATF11Wk1x_99_128_2708_1525_0_small.jpg

'But with the situation still uncertain, millions of refugees are carefully assessing how safe it is to do so. Some are eager, while others are hesitant.' He called for 'patience and vigilance' as refugees weigh their options.

US journalist Austin Tice still alive in Syria, in dire need of f...	Tice has been held hostage in Syria since 2012; Efforts are underway to ensure the safety and rescue of detained journalists, including Tice, following the fall of the Assad regime Exclusive information obtained by The Media Line confirms that U.S. journalist Austin Tice, who was abducted in Syria in 2012, and several other detained journalists are alive, but in urgent need of food and water. Tice, a former U.S. Marine Corps officer, and the other journalists are being hidden in a secure location by a member of the ousted Syrian regime who is attempting to ensure their safe escape from the country. Efforts to ensure the safety of the detained journalists are ongoing. A source in Damascus told The Media Line that Tice and the others have been without food or water since the regime fell. Deliveries are impossible as the person protecting them is in a separate location, and any movement risks compromising their safety. Tice vanished on August 12, 2012, while reporting on clashes near Damascus during Syria’s civil war. A month later, a video surfaced showing him blindfolded and in the custody of unidentified armed men. No group has ever claimed responsibility for his abduction. The Assad regime repeatedly denied knowledge of his whereabouts, though U.S. officials maintained that he was likely being held by the Syrian government or its allies. Born in Texas in 1981, Tice graduated from Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service in 2002 and completed two years at Georgetown’s Law Center before traveling to Syria as a freelance journalist. A former Marine Corps infantry officer, he served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan before pursuing his passion for reporting. Tice’s journalism, which included battlefield dispatches from inside Syria, was published by The Washington Post, McClatchy, Al Jazeera English, and Agence France-Presse, among others. His reporting was among the contributions cited when McClatchy received the George Polk Award for war reporting in Syria. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In the years following his disappearance, Tice’s parents have worked tirelessly to raise awareness about his case. Advocacy efforts include the #FreeAustinTice campaign launched by Reporters Without Borders and a $1 million reward offered by the FBI for information leading to his location. U.S. President Joe Biden has repeatedly affirmed the U.S. government’s commitment to securing Tice’s release, stating with certainty in 2024 that Tice was being held by the Syrian government. On the day of the Assad regime’s fall, President Biden said: 'We think we can get him back,' offering renewed hope for Tice’s return. As Syria faces an uncertain future, the safe rescue of detained journalists, including Tice, remains a priority for those negotiating with remnants of the ousted regime.

3 IDF soldiers killed in anti-tank attack in Jabaliya	The soldiers from the Givati Brigade were killed as they boarded an armored truck; 12 soldiers were injured in the same incident with 3 in serious condition Three soldiers from the Givati Brigade were killed Monday in Jabaliya in the northern Gaza Strip, after an anti-tank missile was fired at them while they were preparing to board an armored truck, the IDF spokesperson announced on Monday evening. Some 12 additional soldiers were injured, three of them seriously, and were evacuated by helicopter to a hospital. The soldiers were from the Shaked Battalion of the Givati Brigade. They are: Staff Sergeant Ido Zano, 20, from Yehud-Monosson, a combat medic; Staff Sergeant Barak Daniel Halpern, 19, from Kiryat Ono, a squad commander; and Sergeant Omri Cohen, 19, from Ashdod. Details of the initial investigation into the incident will be provided after they are passed on to the bereaved families. Sergeant Omri Cohen's funeral will take place at 9:30 p.m. on Monday night in Ashdod. The Amit Ashdod Yeshiva, where he studied, said after his death: 'We are saddened and mourn the fall of the yeshiva graduate in defense of the people and the country, on the Gaza border. Omri, an outstanding student in his studies, had a heart of gold who was loved by his friends and teachers and wanted to serve the country and contribute to it as much as he could.' The head of the yeshiva, Rabbi Shalom Malul, said that Omri was one of its special graduates. 'A boy who loved life and therefore sought to protect it,' he said. 'The loss is difficult and the grief is heartbreaking. Many of our graduates serve on the front lines and we pray every day for them and for all IDF fighters and soldiers. Omri was a beloved and talented student with high abilities who achieved excellent achievements. His educators and teachers, together with the entire yeshiva, share in the terrible grief of the parents and family members.' Rabbi Guy Bitan, Omri's 12th grade teacher, eulogized him: 'We lost a young man full of joy for life, energetic, sharp and brilliant, a true friend and much loved by all. A leader. He loved this country and our state so much and dreamed of continuing his contribution in the army in meaningful service. Our hearts are with his dear family and all who loved him.' Earlier, an IDF spokesman named four reservists of the 226th Brigade's 9263rd Battalion killed during operational activity in southern Lebanon. They were named as Maj. (res.) Evgeny Zinershain, 43, from Zichron Yaakov, a company commander; Capt. (res.) Sagi Ya’akov Rubinshtein, 31, from Lavie, a platoon commander; Master Sgt. (res.) Binyamin Destaw Negose, 28, from Beit Shemesh; and Sgt. 1st Class (res.) Erez Ben Efraim, 25, from Ramat Gan. These are the first casualties to fall in battle in Lebanon since the ceasefire with Hezbollah came into effect. The collapse occurred Sunday afternoon during a clearance operation near the village of Labbouneh. The 226th Brigade’s engineering team was working to expose underground compounds suspected of housing weapons. During the operation, a large explosion caused the collapse of a bunker, burying the soldiers under the rubble. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Home Front Command teams worked for hours to recover the soldiers’ bodies. No other injuries were reported. The IDF is investigating whether the explosion was caused by a pre-existing explosive device or accidentally triggered by IDF forces. Officials are probing the possibility that the detonation was unintentional and linked to equipment used by Israeli troops.' Since the outbreak of the war on October 7 last year, 816 people have been killed, 384 of whom have been killed since the start of the ground maneuvers in the Gaza Strip about three weeks later. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byvwrjveyl	2024-12-09T08:22:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/HJFBEqVEJx/HJFBEqVEJx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
These are the 4 IDF heroes killed in a building collapse in Leban...	Binyamin is the 17th casualty from Beit Shemesh, Evgeny was about to be discharged, Erez's co-workers mourn his loss and Sagi was the embodiment of a patriotic Zionist; The 4 soldiers who fell on Sunday in Lebanon leave a void Major (Res.) Evgeny Zinershain, 43, from Zichron Ya'akov, who was killed on Sunday in a building collapse in southern Lebanon, was a devoted father of three. His widow, Alexandra, tearfully shared: 'It’s incomprehensible. We had an amazing bond; he cared so much for me and the kids – they were truly his entire world. I’m an optical and physics engineer, and Evgeny was a computer science engineer. A friend introduced us during our studies at the Technion, and we built an incredible home together.' 'Evgeny knew it was necessary to go to war; this was his third round,' she added. 'He went up with his battalion on October 7, then stayed in the reserves until February. After that, there was a second round, from summer to spring, and then the third round starting at Sukkot, which was supposed to end at the end of this month. He didn’t share much and didn’t want to tell us how dangerous it was. I always worried about him because, after all, this is Lebanon, and the war hasn’t truly ended.' Alexandra said that 'I loved his smile so much; that’s how I fell in love with him. He was always proud of our family, deeply involved, and a truly brilliant person. He always said we must give everything for the country, leading from the front alongside the soldiers and commanders. He emphasized that this is our duty so that our children would also continue to serve meaningfully for the country he loved so much. It was important to him to keep contributing, performing significant and positive reserve duty. We were all so proud of him.' Alex Hassis, Zinershain’s cousin, shared their last exchange. 'Yesterday morning, around 8:38 a.m., I texted him. He didn’t write much, only asked how the family was doing. Our world has collapsed. At the start of his service, when he enlisted, Evgeny wasn’t in the paratroopers. Later, he transferred and also attended the officers’ course. He was very proud of his long military service. He was supposed to be discharged at the end of this month, and now we’ve been struck by a terrible tragedy that no one can comprehend.' Master Sergeant (Res.) Binyamin Destaw Negose, 28, is the 17th casualty from Beit Shemesh since the war's onset. The municipality issued a statement of condolence: 'The Beit Shemesh municipality mourns the loss of this dear family member and accompanies and embraces them during such difficult moments. Municipal teams will provide the family with all necessary support.' Beit Shemesh Mayor Shmuel Greenberg came to comfort the family. 'The tears have not yet dried from the loss of Staff Sergeant Zamir Burk, and this morning we woke to another loss – Master Sergeant Binyamin Destaw Negose. The heart aches, and words fail to express the magnitude of this loss. We will remember his bravery in protecting the people of Israel, forever,' the mayor said. His funeral will take place today at 3:00 p.m. at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. Sergeant First Class (Res.) Erez Ben Efraim, 25, from Ramat Gan left behind parents and two brothers. Ramat Gan Mayor Carmel Shama-Hacohen eulogized him: ''I have no more words' is what I told the person who informed me this morning that the city had lost another gem in this war. Sergeant First Class Erez Ben Efraim, our hero, fell in battles in Lebanon. Erez, born and raised in Ramat Gan, graduated from Shimon Ben Zvi High School and worked as a programmer at 'Clal Insurance.' He served as a combat soldier in the paratroopers. Erez was the youngest son of Galit and Yaron, and brother to Ehud and Eyal.' 'Beloved Erez was the most precious thing to his family,' according to the mayor. 'His family described him as a rare child, talented and handsome. It’s hard to put into words the talent, abilities and character Erez possessed. His family added that calling him 'the salt of the earth' doesn’t do him justice. All of Ramat Gan shares in the family’s immense grief, embracing and supporting them during this time.' The 'Clal Insurance' workers’ union issued a statement following the death of Ben Efraim: 'Dear employees, with deep sorrow and heavy hearts, we announce the devastating news of the loss of Erez Ben Efraim, who worked at the company and was a cherished colleague to all of us. Erez fell during an operational mission in southern Lebanon, fulfilling his role in protecting the nation’s security. Our hearts are with his family during these difficult times. We extend our deepest condolences and keep them in our thoughts and prayers.' Asaf Ben Shabbat, a coworker, shared that 'Erez felt like the younger brother or child of everyone in the office. A creative, talented guy with a magnetic personality. Every time you passed by his desk, he’d ask how you were. Always happy to help—creative, funny, and kind. We missed him during his reserve duty and waited for his return. Now, we’ll miss him forever.' Rabbi Nitzan Berger, head of the Yeshivat AMIT Kfar Ganim , eulogized Capt. (res.) Sagi Ya’akov Rubinshtein: 'Teachers and educators who taught Sagi were shocked by the heartbreaking news. Sagi had an enormous heart. Volunteering, helping others, and his care for people were at the center of his life. For years, he volunteered with sick children through 'Simcha LeYeled,' (Joy to a Child) always striving to give, contribute and bring light into the world through good deeds. Our hearts go out to his parents, Yoram and Dalia, and all who loved him. We will remember him and teach his kindness and contributions wherever he went.' Rabbi Yoel Manovich, head of the Golan Yeshiva, remembered his student: 'Sagi – how hard it is to say this – was one of the sweetest and finest fruits of the hesder yeshivas. He deliberated on where to enlist but always said, 'Wherever I’m needed, I’ll go.' He had a mix of toughness and natural humility. He completed a commanders’ course, was offered officer training, but chose to return to participate in the yeshiva’s 'officer Torah learning' program to build himself spiritually before resuming command in the military. He returned to the battalion, served as a commander in the paratroopers, finished as a deputy company commander, and returned to further his Torah studies. Later, he married Tal, and together they built a sweet home filled with values and a sense of mission.' Rabbi Manovich concluded: 'Sagi was a beacon of action and values. At every crossroads, he sought ways to contribute to the people of Israel –not for fame, but out of genuine responsibility. He was as strong as a cedar when heading into battle but as tender as a worm when studying Torah. That’s what made him not only an excellent fighter and commander but a truly exceptional person.'

Rubinshtein also left behind a twin brother, Roi. Management at Laniado Hospital in Netanya, where Roi works as a nurse, expressed condolences for his profound loss. Zohar Oberman, a friend from Kibbutz Lavi, spoke of Rubinstein: 'Sagi was born in Petah Tikva but moved to Lavi after marrying Tal, a daughter of the kibbutz. A father of three, Sagi worked as a paramedic in Magen David Adom in the Galilee and as an informal education instructor in the kibbutz. Over the past year, he spent more than 200 days in reserve duty on the northern border and in Lebanon. He was a joyful, Zionist, patriotic, and value-driven man who loved the people and the country. He always answered the call, always first to contribute to the community and the nation.' Petah Tikva Mayor Rami Greenberg also mourned Rubinshtein, whose parents live in the Hadar Ganim neighborhood. He said, 'Sagi joins the hundreds of heroes who gave their lives for us, for the security of the State of Israel. We share in the family’s overwhelming grief and will assist them however needed.' Avishai Mizrahi, Rubinstein’s teacher in Petah Tikva, said: 'What a light Sagi Rubinshtein was. A big heart, always ready, always extending a hand, first to help, always dependable, taking full responsibility and leading.' The Lower Galilee Regional Council announced it bows its head over Rubinstein’s death. His friend, Deputy Council Head Dudu Berger, eulogized: 'Sagi, may his memory be blessed, was a quiet, modest, introverted, and humble man. Beloved by all, a man of kindness. Sagi volunteered in Magen David Adom’s emergency medical services in the Lower Galilee, saving many lives within the community and beyond. He always sought ways to help, support, and give to anyone in need.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sjr00mt4e1g	2024-12-09T08:06:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/Bkl04BVVJl/Bkl04BVVJl_0_77_1600_901_0_small.jpg
Former Israeli president claims Queen Elizabeth ‘saw Israelis as ...	Reuven Rivlin exposes frosty ties with late monarch but praises King Charles as 'so friendly' in speech at Technion gala In London Reuven Rivlin revealed the extent of his frosty relationship with Queen Elizabeth II in a speech in London on Sunday night. The former president of Israel said that: 'The relationship between us and Queen Elizabeth was a little bit difficult, because she believed that every one of us was either a terrorist or a son of a terrorist.' He added: 'She refused to accept any Israeli official into (Buckingham) Palace, apart from international occasions.' By comparison, he revealed that King Charles III was always 'so friendly.' Asked to clarify his surprising comments, Rivlin said: 'These are my words, this is what I said.' Israel’s 10th president made the unprecedented remark during a gala dinner commemorating 100 years of the Technion Institute of Technology, held at the Royal Lancaster Hotel in London. King Charles twice visited Israel unofficially for the funerals of Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin, before undertaking an official visit in 2020. Queen Elizabeth II never visited Israel during her 70-year reign. 'I hope the new U.S. president will herald a new era in the Middle East. We (Israel), alongside the Arabs and Arab nations are not doomed to live together, our destiny is to live to together,' Rivlin told the 300-strong audience. 'They (Arab nations) cannot kick us out as we have nowhere else to go. So let us all get on and live together in peace.' Rivlin offered some advice for the current prime minister, saying that 'Iron Dome is very important but you must have strategy before any tactics. Rivlin was honored at the event as recipient of the 2024 Churchill Award, whose former winners include Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev and King Hussein of Jordan. Israel has received five academic Nobel prizes, four of which are attributed to the Technion. These include the 2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of ubiquitin mediated protein degradation, as well as the 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems. The leading research university has produced countless technological advancements, from harvesting the first embryonic stem cells in the world to inventing drip irrigation systems that have revolutionized agriculture in arid regions worldwide.

'This has not been an easy year for the Technion. We have been severely hit by the war and its aftermath. Many of us have lost family members, with 12 of our family being abducted to Gaza on October 7. Seven are still there,' said Professor Uri Sivan, president of the Technion. 'We are therefore proud to mark 100 years but are not celebrating.'

U.S. officials are communicating with people in Syria to seek information about Austin Tice, an American journalist captured there more than 12 years ago, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Monday. 'This is a top priority for us - to find Austin Tice, to locate the prison where he may be held, get him out, get him home safely to his family,' Sullivan said on ABC's 'Good Morning America.' 'We are talking through the Turks and others to people on the ground in Syria to say, 'Help us with this. Help us get Austin Tice home.'' Tice, a former U.S. Marine and a freelance journalist, was 31 when he was abducted in August 2012 while reporting in Damascus on the uprising against Syrian President Bashar Assad, who was ousted by Syrian rebels who seized the capital Damascus on Sunday. Syria had denied he was being held. President Joe Biden said on Sunday the U.S. government believes Tice is alive. Tice's parents said on Monday they were watching families reunited in Syria and know that will be possible for them as well. 'Austin Tice is alive, in Syria, and it's time for him to come home.

Following drone strike on central Israel apartment, IDF considers...	A drone from Yemen exploded in a Yavne penthouse, causing heavy damage but no injuries; Residents question how it evaded detection as IDF investigates the failure to intercept and plans better defenses against recurring aerial threats Appearing to come out of nowhere, a drone exploded in a penthouse apartment in the central city of Yavne, adjacent to the Mediterranean shore on Monday. It approached from the sea, crossed over Sderot, and turned northward. Detected near Ashdod, it triggered electronic warfare countermeasures. Detection lasted only minutes before the drone disappeared from tracking systems, rendering interception by a scrambled fighter jet impossible. The IDF is now investigating why the drone did not trigger any warning sirens, examining responses to attacks in Yemen, and exploring ways to bolster defenses against this recurring threat that continues to reach Israel from the east every few days. Initially, the IDF claimed the incident stemmed from a solar water heater explosion. However, reports from residents raised suspicions, pointing to a drone attack. 'Reports were received of a suspicious aerial object falling in Yavne’s vicinity. No siren was activated, and the incident is under investigation,' the IDF spokesperson said in a statement. Later, there was confirmation. 'Following the initial report, a UAV that likely originated in Yemen impacted in the area of Yavne. As of now, no injuries were reported. No sirens were sounded. The incident is under review,' according to the IDF spokesperson's office. Footage captured the dramatic moment when the building was hit, documenting heavy damage to the 16th-floor penthouse balcony. Drone fragments scattered around the building provided further evidence of the incident. Etti Avivi, the penthouse owner, shared her relief that her 14-year-old dog Humi survivedg the crash without injury. 'A drone crashing into my balcony? I have a better chance of winning the lottery,' she quipped. 'I was outside when I heard the crash and boom. I never imagined it was my home. I was worried about Humi, who was alone in the house.' 'I was outside when I heard the crash and loud boom, never imagining it happened at my home,' she also said. Neighbors joked, 'Now Humi will be classified as a victim of hostile actions.' Avivi, a mother of four, including two soldiers currently on active duty, added: 'I’m so relieved Humi was safe. He must have been in the living room. I heard the explosion like everyone else, but only realized it was my home when calls started coming in. We’re lucky no one was hurt.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Rotem Vaturi, a resident on the building’s ninth floor, said: 'I was working from home when I heard a loud buzzing noise. I stepped outside to see what it was and then heard a massive boom. I ran to the safe room, not believing it was a drone.' Another resident expressed frustration, saying, 'So many people saw the drone on its way—why didn’t the military detect and intercept it?' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjp00d00nv1g	2024-12-09T06:40:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/H1BE7NEEke/H1BE7NEEke_0_112_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Syria, Gaza and Lebanon on the agenda: Biden's senior advisor wil...	National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan set to land in Israel on Thursday, the same day that the political-security cabinet is set to convene; He is scheduled to meet with prime minister and defense minister Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor to outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden, is scheduled to arrive in Israel on Thursday. The political-security cabinet is expected to convene on that day. Sullivan, one of the senior advisors in the Biden administration, will discuss with his Israeli colleagues the cease- fire in Lebanon , the dramatic developments in Syria, and also the talks for a hostage deal in the Gaza Strip . As part of his visit, Sullivan will meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz, and is also expected to discuss various issues with Minister Ron Dermer and National Security Council Chairman Tzachi Hanegbi. Reuters reported earlier Monday that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's designated Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said he 'hopes the hostages will be released before the president's inauguration.' Trump has threatened that if Hamas does not release the hostages by his inauguration on January 20, there will be 'all Hell to pay in the Middle East.' Witkoff added that he is 'praying for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.' Suillivan's visit will also deal with developments in Syria. The Israeli Air Force attacked dozens of targets across the country overnight in numerous waves of attacks, targeting various weapons depots, so that they would not pose a threat to Israel in the future. A day after the fall of the Assad regime, the IDF recognizes that Iran is cutting off weapons and smuggling operatives out of Syria, so that they can survive. At the same time, the IDF is attacking and preventing the transfer of weapons from Syria to Lebanon. On Monday, the IDF deployed additional forces with artillery and tanks in the Golan and the buffer zone, as well as in Syrian-controlled points near the border. Syrian army posts have been abandoned in the Syrian Golan, and the IDF is monitoring the weapons remaining in them. The IDF is also detecting initial movements of Russian forces and their resources in Syria. Assad's loyalists are left with a last enclave of the Alawite community in Little Syria near the coast, between Tartus and Latakia. The chairman of the National Unity party, Benny Gantz, said at his faction's meeting in the Knesset in light of the latest developments in the region: 'The IDF did well and it is good that the political echelon approved seizing the controlling positions in the Syrian Golan and operating against the significant weapons facilities. For years, we have operated against weapons shipments and we have operated against Iranian entrenchment. Now we understand how critical this was. We must now set the rules of the game: No Iranian shipment will cross into Syria; No Iranian foothold will be accepted on our border; And no threat will be built near our cities.' 'We must not stop, in the face of anyone who threatens us,' Gantz added. 'The Houthis must suffer a fatal, continuous and severe blow that will stop their attacks - the port of Hodeidah should only be the Beginning. And if it is not enough to hit Yemen - we must respond directly to Iran. We must weaken Hezbollah's influence on Lebanon, and connect it to the axis of moderate countries. And we must look not only north but mainly far east toward Iran. Iran is more dangerous now. A nuclear breakthrough as a response to developments is a realistic option. Therefore, we must prepare for dramatic and rapid actions.' Opposition leader Knesset member Yair Lapid said at a Yesh Atid faction meeting: 'Israel did the right thing when it took action on the Syrian Hermon. The change of government and the instability in Syria de facto nullify the 1974 separation agreement. The international community cannot have any objection to this step. It is proportionate and it is binding. Israel did and is doing the right thing when it continues to act against the weapons stockpiles in Syria, emphasizing chemical weapons and air defense systems.' Lapid added: 'On the political level, Israel acted exactly the opposite. Prime Minister Netanyahu's conduct was irresponsible, dangerous and also devoid of any political logic. There is no reason that less than 24 hours after the fall of Damascus, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense would stand on the Syrian border and say that Assad fell thanks to our actions. The last thing the rebels in Syria need or want is for them to say that they came to power thanks to Israel. This is unnecessary arrogance, it leads them to react. Sooner or later they will try to prove to the Arab world that this is not true.' Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar confirmed Monday morning that Israel attacked various targets in Syria, 'so that they do not fall into the hands of extremist elements.' In a briefing for foreign reporters at the Foreign Ministry, Sa'ar said: 'What guides us is the security of the State of Israel and its citizens. Therefore, we attacked strategic weapons arrays, residual chemical weapons capabilities, long-range missiles and rockets - so that they do not fall into the hands of extremist elements.' The border crossing between Syria and Lebanon has been rendered unusable following an Israeli attack, according to a report in the official Syrian news agency SANA on Friday. According to another report in Lebanon, the attack in Al-Arida cut off the road connecting the two countries. At the same time, IDF spokesman Brigadier General Daniel Hegary announced on Friday an 'attack on the routes for smuggling weapons and terrorist infrastructure to Hezbollah, near the Syrian regime's border crossings between Syria and Lebanon.' According to the announcement, the attack was part of the IDF's activity in recent weeks, aimed at damaging the capabilities of Hezbollah's Unit 4400, 'responsible for transferring weapons used to carry out terrorist attacks against the Israeli home front and IDF forces.' Regarding the deal to release the hostages, Lishay Lavi Miran whose husband Omri has been held captive by Hamas for 430 days, on Monday morning addressed the Qatari report about progress in talks for a deal, and shared in a conversation with Ynet that 'I have not received an update on the list.' Israel denied the report, and the Hostage Affairs Directorate in the Prime Minister's Office , headed by Brigadier General (res.) Gal Hirsch, stated that 'the publications are incorrect.' Lavi-Miran also participated in a meeting of families of hostages with Netanyahu, and said: 'I did not come out optimistic, but I wish I had been deceived.' Alon Nimrodi, the father of the kidnapped soldier Tamir Nimrodi, said that he was not present at Sunday's meeting. 'He only meets with his own people,' the father said, attacking the prime minister. 'I would tell Netanyahu everything he doesn't like to hear, my truth is painful for a kidnapped soldier. I am happy about the latest report that Hamas has passed a list, but as long as the head of the Mossad is in Israel - nothing is happening. Who on our side is currently conducting the negotiations?' he wondered.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryonzy441e	2024-12-09T06:24:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/01/SJbmDiTFRR/SJbmDiTFRR_0_29_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Hamas congratulates Syrians on ending Assad's rule	Hamas congratulated the Syrian people on Monday for achieving their 'aspirations for freedom and justice' after toppling President Bashar al-Assad. It was Hamas' first public comment since rebel forces swept into the Syrian capital Damascus on Sunday after a lightning advance that sent Assad fleeing to Russia after a 13-year civil war and six decades of his family's autocratic rule. 'We stand strongly with the great people of Syria... and respect the will, the independence, and the political choices of the people of Syria,' the Islamist faction that has been ruling the Gaza Strip said in a statement. Hamas said it hoped that post-Assad Syria would continue 'its historical and pivotal role in supporting the Palestinian people.' In a separate statement,, Ziad al-Nakhala, head of the Islamic Jihad, an Iranian-backed group and an ally of Hamas, echoed that sentiment. 'The Islamic Jihad hopes Syria will remain a real support for the Palestinian people, their just cause, as it has always been,' said Nakhala. Hamas publicly endorsed the 2011 Sunni Muslim street uprising against Assad's rule and vacated its Damascus headquarters in 2012, a move that angered Iran, an ally of both Assad and the Palestinian group. Hamas, whose ideological roots stem from the Sunni Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, distanced itself from Assad - a member of the minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam - as he cracked down on the mainly Sunni Muslim protesters and rebels. The Palestinian group decided in 2022 to restore ties with the Assad government and sent a delegation to Damascus, where Hamas leaders met Assad in the hope of repairing relations. Assad's Syria and Iran formed an 'axis of resistance' with Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and Palestinian militant groups to oppose Israel. Hamas's positive response to the fall of Assad contrasted with that of Shi'ite Muslim Hezbollah , which played a major part propping up Assad through years of war.

Speaking at a press briefing for foreign media in Jerusalem, Sa'ar emphasized Israel's sole focus on safeguarding its citizens' security.

'The decision to act was made to prevent an event like the Hamas massacre of Oct. 7,' Sa'ar said, referencing a deadly attack that killed over 1,200 Israelis and saw 254 more taken hostage by Hamas-led terrorists. Earlier, the IDF announced that paratroopers and other forces were operating in the buffer zone to secure Israeli communities against potential threats.

Recently redeployed from Lebanon, troops now man forward outpost near Syria; tasked with destroying weapons stockpiles, they confront roaming militias and unclear rules of engagement, raising questions about permanence of presence in Syria Israeli paratroopers from the elite reconnaissance unit recently withdrew from Khiam, the northernmost Lebanese village held by the IDF during the past two months, after completing operations there. Their current mission places them in the northern Golan Heights, where they face a new array of challenges near the Syrian frontier. On Sunday, the soldiers were stationed in an abandoned IDF outpost in the Valley of Tears, overlooking the Syrian border. The position, now a maze of cold, dark tunnels, once housed their predecessors 51 years ago during the Yom Kippur War. Surrounded by basalt stone walls, they huddled around a small burner to stave off the biting December cold, a stark contrast to their recent missions in southern Lebanon and Gaza. 'It’s much colder here than in Lebanon,' said one soldier as he opened a can of tuna from his combat rations. 'At least in Khiam, we slept inside houses.' These young soldiers, barely 20 years old, have been at the forefront of Israel’s military campaigns in Gaza, Lebanon and now Syria within just three months. They fought Hamas in the Jabalya refugee camp, Hezbollah in Lebanon and are now positioned against a mix of armed Syrian rebel groups that could threaten Israeli communities such as Ein Zivan, Katzrin, Buq’ata and Meitzar. While some of their comrades hold advanced positions beyond the tall border fence built a decade ago, others operate deeper inside Syrian territory. Initially, the IDF secured the buffer zone between the internationally recognized border and Syrian-controlled territory. Over time, Israeli forces have seized key hilltops and commanding positions inside Syria, prioritizing strategic locations with difficult topography. Sunday morning, the Air Force’s elite commando unit, Shaldag, captured a significant area in northern Golan, securing critical high ground with commanding views over Quneitra and beyond. The IDF now controls vital observation and defensive positions along the region’s most contested zones. In the southern Golan, Israeli forces also extended their reach into the rugged Rokad Valley, a deep, jagged ravine marked by red-and-white boundary barrels but lacking a formal border fence. The soldiers’ presence highlights the shifting dynamics in the Golan Heights, where for the first time in over a century, the area’s geopolitical landscape is being redrawn. The Syrian border, established in 1916 by British and French diplomats, now separates not only a sovereign state but also a nascent new order as rebel factions carve out their territories. Danger at the tri-border area Fighters from the Golan Reconnaissance Unit, a newly formed and small force composed of West Bank settler youth and based on a similar unit disbanded last year, have been deployed to one of the most dangerous corners of the region. This area, near the tri-border zone at Hamat Gader and the striking Yarmouk River, has a troubled history. A decade ago, residents of the Syrian village of Jamla, on the eastern bank, hosted insurgents from Jabhat al-Nusra, the extremist rebel faction in southern Syria. From there, attacks involving roadside bombs and gunfire were launched against IDF forces, until Assad’s troops regained control of the region in 2019. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In southern Syria, between Daraa and Hauran near the Israeli border, the landscape is now dominated by a mix of rebel groups, far removed from the so-called 'moderate' Hayat Tahrir al-Sham led by the newly ascendant Islamist figure Abu Muhammed al-Golani, who captured Damascus on Sunday. 'In the Syrian Golan, we’ve observed armed groups over the weekend that remain unidentified, right along the buffer zone with us,' an IDF official said Sunday night. 'These groups operate with varying ideologies and a vast array of weapons circulating in a state armed like a monster. That’s why we recommended, at least temporarily, establishing forward defenses within enemy territory.' So far, the IDF's efforts to capture these positions have faced little resistance, with Assad’s soldiers abandoning their posts and fleeing the area. Closed military zone declared in the Golan Gunfire was absent in the Golan Heights on Sunday as restaurants began reopening, less than two weeks after the cease-fire with Hezbollah. The terrorist group had launched hundreds of rockets and drones at the region. Occasional distant explosions, however, echoed from Israeli Air Force strikes near Damascus, targeting potential threats to Israel, including surface-to-surface missiles, advanced air defense systems, remnants of chemical weapons and weapons development facilities. The Quneitra crossing, the closest point of contact between the IDF and Syrian forces, was abandoned by Assad’s troops over the weekend without clashes or mortar fire—common occurrences in the past decade. Primarily used by UNDOF observers, the crossing once saw wedding celebrations between Druze families on both sides of the border and apple shipments from Mas’ade to Syria, now distant memories. On Sunday, the Northern Command declared a closed military zone, restricting access to agricultural and tourist areas near the border fence. By midnight, the restrictions were lifted in the Marom Golan–Ein Zivan and Buq’ata–Khirbet Ein Hura areas. While soldiers remain deep in forward positions, civilians in the rear are beginning to clear the dust of war and recover. Signs of lingering tensions remain, with rear defense lines established this year revealing the region’s volatility. Camouflaged tanks and military vehicles were stationed discreetly near a kibbutz exit. The rules of engagement here vary along the border, as Syrian locals continue farming and herding livestock. Soldiers, many recently deployed from Lebanon, face challenges distinguishing threats, such as identifying armed combatants versus civilians in camouflage, or determining engagement limits for vehicles crossing the Quneitra road toward Marom Golan. The skies remain active, with fighter jets soaring at high altitudes and drones conducting surveillance below. Reserve soldiers who had recently returned to civilian life are back in uniform, resuming readiness in local communities. Despite this, the effort to maintain or project a sense of normalcy continues, even as uncertainties about the future loom. By late afternoon, four IDF D9 bulldozers arrived near the border fence below Majdal Shams, where residents were celebrating Assad’s downfall near the iconic 'Shouting Hill.' The bulldozers were poised to cross the border, ascend high Syrian positions and secure the Druze village of Hader. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjs1lpv41g	2024-12-09T03:37:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/rkZVQPGEVJl/rkZVQPGEVJl_0_1_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Syrian rebels free prisoners from notorious Assad prison, search ...	White Helmets teams, equipped with search dogs and rescue specialists, scoure Saydnaya prison for underground cells hidden behind walls and armored doors; while some located, others remain inaccessible, leaving prisoners’ fates unknown Just north of Damascus, in Saydnaya military prison—infamously called the 'human slaughterhouse' and a symbol of Assad’s regime—efforts are underway to uncover secret underground cells where prisoners remain trapped after access routes were blocked. On Monday, members of the White Helmets searched for hidden cells based on accounts from survivors. Five specialized teams, including search-and-rescue personnel, wall-breaching experts, search dogs and physicians, were deployed to the site. Since the start of the 2011 uprising against Assad, armed opposition forces and non-violent protesters were incarcerated there, as were military officers suspected of disloyalty to the dictator. According to Amnesty International, some 13,000 people were hanged in the prison between 2011 and 2015. As the insurgents swept toward Damascus, thousands of prisoners were freed from jails and on Sunday, the rebels reached Saydnaya. Women detainees, some with their children, screamed as men broke the locks off their cell doors. 'Don’t be afraid … Bashar Assad has fallen! Why are you afraid?' said one of the rebels as he tried to rush streams of women out of their jam-packed tiny cells. Hundreds of men were seen running barefoot from the prison, some wearing minimal clothing. Many gestured with their hands to indicate the number of years they had been imprisoned, their faces etched with disbelief and trauma. However, freed prisoners told rebels about hidden underground cells in the Red Block, a section reportedly reserved for high-priority detainees. Doors to these cells required codes known only to senior officials, leaving captives trapped. Rebels inspected the prison’s control room and discovered evidence bolstering suspicions about the existence of secret cells. While some were breached, others remain out of reach. According to reports, some of the cells were found and breached by the rebels but others remain out of reach. One former prisoner, speaking to Al Jazeera, described being packed with 25 others into a tiny cell. 'We sat with our heads bowed and didn’t even know the names of those around us,' he said. Arrested in Aleppo in 2019 for evading military service, he endured beatings, including being struck on the head with a hammer. A day before Assad’s fall, guards removed dozens of detainees, warning some they would be executed. Bashar Barhoum woke in his dungeon prison cell in Damascus at dawn Sunday, thinking it would be the last day of his life. The 63-year-old writer was supposed to have been executed after being imprisoned for seven months. But he soon realized the men at the door weren’t from former Syrian President Bashar Assad’s notorious security forces, ready to take him to his death. Instead, they were rebels coming to set him free. 'I haven’t seen the sun until today,' Barhoum told The Associated Press after walking in disbelief through the streets of Damascus. 'Instead of being dead tomorrow, thank God, he gave me a new lease of life.' Barhoum couldn’t find his cellphone and belongings in the prison so set off to find a way to tell his wife and daughters that he’s alive and well. Torture, executions and starvation in Syria’s prisons Syria’s prisons have been infamous for their harsh conditions. Torture is systematic, say human rights groups, whistleblowers, and former detainees. Secret executions have been reported at more than two dozen facilities run by Syrian intelligence, as well as at other sites. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In 2013, a Syrian military defector, known as 'Caesar,' smuggled out over 53,000 photographs that human rights groups say showed clear evidence of rampant torture, but also disease and starvation in Syria’s prison facilities. Syria’s feared security apparatus and prisons did not only serve to isolate Assad’s opponents, but also to instill fear among his own people said Lina Khatib, Associate Fellow in the Middle East and North Africa program at the London think tank Chatham House. 'Anxiety about being thrown in one of Assad’s notorious prisons created wide mistrust among Syrians,' Khatib said. 'Assad nurtured this culture of fear to maintain control and crush political opposition.' Families seek loved ones who have been missing for years Omar Alshogre, who was detained for three years and survived relentless torture, watched in awe from his home far from Syria as videos showed dozens of detainees fleeing. 'A hundred democracies in the world had done nothing to help them, and now a few military groups came down and broke open prison after prison,' Alshogre, a human rights advocate who now resides in Sweden and the U.S., told The Associated Press. Meanwhile, families of detainees and the disappeared skipped celebrations of the downfall of the Assad dynasty. Instead, they waited outside prisons and security branch centers, hoping their loved ones would be there. They had high expectations for the newcomers who will now run the battered country. 'This happiness will not be completed until I can see my son out of prison and know where he is,' said Bassam Masri. 'I have been searching for him for two hours. He has been detained for 13 years,' since the start of the Syrian uprising in 2011. Rebels struggled to control the chaos as crowds gathered by the Court of Justice in Damascus. Heba, who only gave her first name while speaking to the AP, said she was looking for her brother and brother-in-law who were detained while reporting a stolen car in 2011 and hadn’t been seen since. 'They took away so many of us,' said Heba, whose mother’s cousin also disappeared. 'We know nothing about them ... They (the Assad government) burned our hearts.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj9nss4vye	2024-12-09T03:11:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/08/HJQs7f7Nyl/HJQs7f7Nyl_0_334_1080_608_0_small.jpg

Watch: Palestinian security forces launch rare counterterror oper...	Repeated IDF operations in Jenin bolster PA forces’ confidence to target PIJ terrorists; if successful, PA’s effort to regain and hold control of refugee camp could shift security landscape across West Bank Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces launched an operation against Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) terrorists in the Jenin refugee camp on Monday, marking their first entry into the area in years. Previously, the PA refrained from operating in the camp, leaving counterterrorism efforts to the IDF. Images of the operation, an unusual offensive against terror squads in the camp, showed PA forces equipped with sniper rifles, tactical helmets and armored vehicles—all approved by Israel. The raid followed escalating tensions between PIJ operatives and PA forces, sparked when terrorists seized two PA vehicles and paraded them through the camp. PA intelligence chief Majd Faraj visited the camp to mediate and prevent further conflict, but Monday’s raid signaled a shift in power dynamics, with the weakening of the PIJ-led Jenin Brigade. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Photos of stolen PA jeeps adorned with Hamas and PIJ flags served as a tipping point for the PA's decision to act. On Thursday, PA forces secured Jenin’s hospitals, sealing access to the camp in preparation for their incursion. On Monday, they opened the gates and launched an assault, clearing explosive devices planted by terrorists. In a statement, PA security forces announced their mission to restore law and order in Jenin and its refugee camp for civilian protection. 'There will be no backing down from enforcing law and order, arresting criminals, confiscating resources and cutting off suspicious funds,' a spokesperson told the Wafa news agency, adding that all evidence would be presented to Palestinian courts and confirming that one security officer was moderately injured in the operation. The repeated IDF incursions into Jenin in recent months are believed to have bolstered the PA’s confidence to reclaim control of the area. However, it remains unclear if the PA can maintain its hold on the camp—an outcome with potentially significant implications for West Bank security. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjfsy444ye	2024-12-09T02:11:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/BylN00hfE4yl/BylN00hfE4yl_0_281_720_405_0_small.jpg

How a healthcare CEO’s killer became an American hero	Public outrage toward US healthcare system fuels notoriety of Brian Thompson’s killer; UnitedHealthcare CEO’s assailant remains at large, drawing attention and, for some, unexpected sympathy He murdered a man in cold blood in the middle of a Manhattan street, leaving two children fatherless. Yet, the man who shot Brian Thompson, CEO of the health insurance company UnitedHealthcare, in the back is gaining increasing support daily — to the level of a national hero in the U.S. A grainy photo of him from the hotel he stayed at before the murder has drawn comparisons to Hollywood stars and jackets similar to the one he wore have sold out online. On Saturday, a look-alike contest in his honor took place at Washington Square Park in Manhattan. The NYPD has offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to his capture, but so far, not only has no one claimed the prize, but the hotel where the killer stayed has been flooded with negative online reviews for cooperating with the police. This grim story — from a cold-blooded murder on a New York City street to the public's reaction — reiterates that the most hated industry in the U.S. is health insurance. For Thompson’s friends and grieving family, this is a horrific nightmare. But for many Americans, it’s become an opportunity to vent their frustrations at the health insurance system and the immensely wealthy, powerful figures leading it. According to a survey conducted last year by KFF, a nonprofit healthcare think tank, about 6 in 10 adults reported experiencing issues with their health insurance within the previous 12 months, such as surprise bills or denial of treatment approvals. The sicker individuals were, the worse their struggles with insurance companies became. UnitedHealth Group, UnitedHealthcare’s parent company, is the fourth-largest company in the U.S., raking in over $22 billion in 2023. Its insurance division is arguably the most despised, known for rejecting more claims than any other insurer. It employs tactics such as 'prior authorization,' requiring doctors to submit additional paperwork upfront to justify treatments and prescriptions and relying on algorithms to delay or deny approvals. American insurance companies bring in hundreds of millions in annual profits while subjecting policyholders to constant red tape. And the situation today is significantly better than before 2010, when then-president Barack Obama introduced comprehensive healthcare reform. Before the law, known as Obamacare, tens of millions of Americans couldn’t afford health insurance at all. Most workers receive insurance through their employers, but they remain just one job loss or serious illness away from financial catastrophe. For example, prior to Obamacare, there were no limits on out-of-pocket costs for patients. Insurers could refuse coverage for almost any reason, even for something as basic as being born with asthma. Women were routinely charged significantly higher premiums. While many of these issues have been addressed, the nightmare of needing an insurer's help during a real crisis remains unchanged. Adding to the killer’s 'heroic' image were three words etched onto one of the bullets that hit Thompson: 'depose,' 'deny' and 'delay.' All these words are associated with tactics insurers use to avoid paying claims. Users across social media commented that their empathy for this case had been 'denied.' Many posts received tens of thousands of likes, particularly those sharing stories of battling insurance companies' refusals to cover the exorbitant costs of medical treatments, especially those by UnitedHealthcare. For executives of major corporations, particularly in the pharmaceutical and insurance industries, Thompson’s murder is an especially shocking moment. It’s even led some large companies to remove their executives' photos from their websites. Alex Goldenberg, a senior advisor at the Network Contagion Research Institute — which tracks online threats — told The New York Times that the online rhetoric had left experts 'disturbed' at the glorification of Thompson's murder. The institute found that six out of the 10 most viral posts on X (formerly Twitter) on the day of the murder 'either expressed explicit or implicit support for the killing or denigrated the victim.' This dynamic mirrors discussions that often follow mass shootings on far-right online message boards like 4chan and 8chan. 'But what’s disturbing about this is it’s mainstream,' Goldenberg said. 'It’s being framed as some opening blow in a broader class war, which is very concerning.' The killer’s supporters come from both sides of the political spectrum. Hatred for health insurance companies is one of the few things that unite the American people today. The starkest example of support for Thompson’s killer is the silence of prominent Internet sleuths. These are some of the biggest online figures who have previously helped the FBI identify hundreds of Capitol rioters on January 6, 2021. Now, their silence is deafening.

Hamas provides names of first hostages to be freed as cease-fire ...	Terror group leaders in Cairo confirm progress in talks; Palestinian factions in Gaza reveal Hamas requested lists of hostages and details about their medical conditions ahead of potential agreement Negotiations for a cease-fire in Gaza and hostage release are progressing, with Hamas submitting a list of hostages to mediators in Cairo, Qatari newspaper The News Arab reported on Monday. The paper cited advanced talks mediated by Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the U.S., including exchanges of names for a potential deal. Egyptian intelligence reportedly received names of hostages with medical conditions and elderly captives, as well as Palestinian prisoners to be freed from Israeli jails. An Israeli delegation was expected to arrive in Cairo on Monday to finalize aspects of the agreement. The report also claimed that four hostages with U.S. citizenship, not meeting the humanitarian conditions of the first phase, would be included. The Americans among the 100 hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza include Edan Alexander, Keith Siegel, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Omer Neutra, Itay Chen, Judi Weinstein Haggai and her husband Gadi Haggai, with some reported to be deceased. Hamas confirmed its delegation left Cairo after talks with Egyptian intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Hassan Rashad.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Sunday that ousted Syrian president Bashar Assad 'never asked' for Tehran's aid against the rebels that overtook Damascus in a lightning offensive and drove him from power. 'We were never asked for help,' Araghchi said in a live interview on state television, adding that it was Syrian army's duty to counter the offensive, which on Sunday toppled Assad. Iran had backed the Syrian leader with military advisers during his country's years-long civil war, in which forces of the Tehran-backed Hezbollah movement also supported the government. According to the Financial Times, Iran had lost faith in the Syrian dictator even before his fall and Araghchi told him during his last visit to Damascus that Tehran would not be able to send forces to his regime's aid after its proxy's long war with Israel. The paper said that according to an official close to the government in Iran, Assad told the visiting minister that his withdrawal from Aleppo was tactical and that he was still in control of his country. The source said the speed of Assad's fall was a shocking surprise to the Iranians. The FT said in its report that among the reasons for Iran's refusal to help their ally was the Israeli attacks on the Iranians in Syria and the feeling in Tehran that Assad was unreliable and even a traitor for not preventing those attacks. The source said there was a years-long frustration in the Iranian regime and that the past years made it clear to them that Assad's time was over. He said the Syrian leader had become and obstacle and his inaction against the Israeli strikes cost the Iranians dearly, adding that Assad seems to align himself with regional actors who promised him a future that never came. Some in Iran believed Assad was returning to the fold of other Arab nations such as the UAE after promises that they would help rehabilitate his country after the war, in exchange for distancing himself from Iran's influence. After his fall, those same voices accused officials in Damascus of leaking information about the whereabouts of Iranian commanders in Syria, to the Israelis and said Assad had deserted Iran when it needed him most. Still, the fall of the Assad regime is a devastating blow to Iran's foreign policy and regional strategy against Israel. Syria was a critical part of the 'ring of fire' Iran established around Israel and there are concerns in Tehran that the fall of the Assad regime would cause a ripple effect in Iraq, where Iran's hold is significant. Iranians officials said they now had to ensure that the same scenario played out in Syria is not repeated in Iraq and Yemen and that it was time to take action because the efforts undertaken over 40-years could unravel overnight. But other Iranian officials insist that Iran would be able to continue its influence on Syria even after the rebel takeover of the country and that negotiations with the rebel groups should begin. The source said that although Assad was removed by militants who oppose the Shiites, they do share a hate of Israel with Tehran. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: An Israeli official told the FT that Israel does not believe the Iranian influence near its borders would just disappear because Iran thrives in chaos. He said it was too soon to say whether Iran would withdraw from Syria or if Hezbollah would remove its operatives from that country and it was most likely that Israel would still have to deal with the Iranian threat for at least the next decade. It appears that there is some debate in Tehran over the right strategy going forward. One Iranian lawmaker said Tehran must not only revive its axis but also carry out a nuclear test to solidify its regional control. Others called for caution because Hezbollah was now weak, and the axis had taken a blow. They believed it would take time to rebuild Hezbollah's military capabilities and until that can be achieved Iran must consider its moves. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s17qnwnnke	2024-12-08T21:03:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/05/r1tl9sCR0/r1tl9sCR0_273_148_917_516_0_small.jpg
Australian Jews question their future amid escalating antisemitic...	Alon Cassuto says Australian Jewish community wonders if this is the 'beginning of the end' for them The Australian Jewish community is beginning to wonder if 'it is the beginning of the end' for them in the country, according to Alon Cassuto, CEO of the Zionist Federation of Australia. Speaking to ILTV on Sunday, Cassuto said, 'The saddest thing for our community is that many are losing hope that things will get better and are starting to expect things will get worse.' He noted that the community, which had been 'so strong and thriving' before October 7, is now questioning its future in Australia. This uncertainty has grown following a terror attack on Friday in which a Melbourne synagogue was set on fire. However, Cassuto admitted he was 'not entirely surprised' by the incident, citing a surge in antisemitic incidents over the past year. These included an assault on a local rabbi’s home, a synagogue being forced into lockdown, Jewish stores targeted by graffiti and violence, and even Jewish members of parliament having their offices set on fire. 'It’s been really the kind of escalation that's been happening over the course of many months. And our community,' Cassuto told ILTV. In the aftermath of the Melbourne attack, the government committed $32 million in security measures for the Jewish community, a move Cassuto described as 'significant.' However, he criticized the funding as a 'reactive gesture' rather than a 'proactive gesture' that addresses the root causes of the community’s vulnerability or ensures its safety. 'I'm more concerned than I've ever been for the security of my family, my community, and our people,' Cassuto said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r18ulzve1e	2024-12-08T21:00:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/06/BytjEMgVkg/BytjEMgVkg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Syrian activist calls Assad's fall a 'victory for humanity'	Ammar Al Selmo says, 'We can rebuild all of Syria' A Syrian activist has expressed hope that the country can now 'unite and have peace.' Speaking to ILTV News on Sunday, Ammar Al Selmo, a member of the White Helmets humanitarian group from Aleppo, said that the overthrow of the Assad regime and its army means that 'we can rebuild all of Syria.' 'Syrians deserve peace, deserve to be free, and deserve to work together,' he stated. Al Selmo described the downfall of the Syrian government as a 'day of celebration' and 'happiness,' as well as a 'day of victory for every human being.' He emphasized that he does not believe Syria was radicalized before the involvement of Iran and its proxy Hezbollah, and he does not expect it to be now. According to Al Selmo, it was Iran and Hezbollah that 'turned Syria to be a hell' over the past decades. Watch the full interview above.

Syrians are rid of a tyrant': Israeli and Syrian Druze celebrate...	Syrian Druze rebel commander tells Ynet about their desire to break free from ousted Syrian dictator's rule and deep connection with Israeli counterparts Sheikh Loai, the commander of the Syrian Druze force that liberated Sweida, a province with a considerable Druze population, spoke with Ynet on Sunday amid celebrations following the fall of President Bashar Assad's regime. 'As soon as the rebels began liberating northern Syria, we realized we had to act and remove all symbols of the tyrant Assad's rule, from police stations to military bases,' He recounted. Sweida, located in southern Syria, is the largest Druze stronghold in the Middle East, covering 5,550 square kilometers (2,142 square miles) and home to around 300,000 residents. Assad made significant efforts to limit the independence of the Druze community within his territory. The community’s spiritual leader, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hajri, approved their participation in the campaign while ensuring no civilian harm. 'When we saw the time was right, we acted swiftly,' Sheikh Loai said. 'We organized weapons and moved through the province, asking soldiers and police officers to abandon their posts. Most complied without resistance, but those who didn’t found themselves in armed confrontations. 'Right now, we’re filled with joy. We’ve waited so long for these moments and our region is finally free of the evil that Assad brought upon us,' he added, noting that the Druze's actions were coordinated with the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham rebel group, which led the rebel offensive in northern Syria. Tarek, a Druze journalist who fled to France after being labeled a 'traitor' by the regime, described the situation for the Druze in Syria from afar. 'Assad's regime severely weakened the Druze. He marginalized us militarily, politically and economically.' 'Before Hafez Assad's rise to power, Druze could hold significant military roles, but under his rule, we were held off at the rank of brigadier general. Our province has been isolated and neglected,' he told Ynet. Following the Druze region’s liberation from Assad's rule, community leader al-Hajri issued a statement, saying, 'At this critical moment, we stress the need for vigilance, as the journey ahead is long and the battle is not over.' 'We call on everyone to protect both public and private property as a national and moral duty, prevent acts of vandalism and block any attempt to undermine security and stability in Sweida.' After this announcement, the Druze proudly raised their distinctive flag, an act previously forbidden under Assad's rule. One of the most traumatic events in the region in recent years took place in 2018 when over 250 people were killed in a series of jihadist attacks. This tragedy planted the seeds of rebellion within the Druze community, as the regime failed to come to their aid. Sweida’s Druze maintain strong ties with their brethren in Israel. For over 50 years, many of the thousands of Druze residents in Israel’s four villages in the northern Golan Heights — Majdal Shams, Mas’ade, Buq’ata and Ein Qiniyye — feared showing solidarity with Israel or obtaining Israeli citizenship, concerned that the Golan Heights might one day be returned to Assad’s rule. However, attitudes shifted during the Syrian Civil War in the past decade and some young Druze in the northern Golan even secretly enlisted in the IDF. In Majdal Shams, flags of the Syrian opposition were raised in solidarity with the fall of Assad's regime on Sunday. Salman Fakhr al-Din, a resident of the village with relatives in Syria, said, 'Finally, the Syrians are rid of a tyrant who stole public funds, starved his people and treated the country as his personal property.' Fakhr al-Din described the community’s joy: 'I can’t put the happiness into words. He was a ruler who destroyed everything, with no regard for humanity. People left prisons broken in body and spirit. History has never seen such a cruel leader. He not only slaughtered his own people but sidelined minorities.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Samih Ayoub, another Majdal Shams resident whose brother remains in Syria, joined the celebrations in the village square, where the Syrian opposition flag was draped over the statue of Sultan al-Atrash, leader of the 1925–1927 Druze revolt. 'This is Syria’s Independence Day — the people’s liberation from Assad’s brutal rule. He looted and massacred endlessly. We’re thrilled for our family there and hope they can now live better lives with dignity,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryg4hk7eye	2024-12-08T13:40:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/08/SJbFzRgXV1x/SJbFzRgXV1x_0_109_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Fall of Assad regime sparks hope for Israeli missing persons in S...	Eli Cohen, Guy Hever, Yehuda Katz and Zvi Feldman remain missing for decades; with Assad’s regime toppled, their families hope for answers; 'Prisoners are being freed after 50 years. Maybe they were held in dark dungeons under the brutal regime' The collapse of Bashar Assad’s regime on Sunday has reignited hope among families of Israeli missing persons in Syria, who believe the leadership change could pave the way for the return of their loved ones—alive or for burial in Israel. Nadia Cohen, widow of Israeli spy Eli Cohen, whose body was buried in Damascus after his 1965 execution, expressed optimism that Assad’s ouster may bring closure. 'Since Syria’s instability began, I’ve urged Mossad to solve this issue and bring Eli home for burial,' she told Ynet. On Friday, which marked the centenary of Eli Cohen’s birth, Mossad chief David Barnea wrote her a heartfelt message emphasizing the importance of repatriating his remains. 'With recent events in Syria, I hope Israel understands this is the right time,' she said. Cohen recounted a past appeal to Assad himself, which was rejected. 'He said Eli would return ‘when the time comes.’ Perhaps that time is now,' she said. 'I don’t want Eli’s remains left in Syria. The turmoil there could work in our favor. I wish peace for both the Syrian people and us and hope this opportunity will lead to Eli’s body being returned to Israel so he can rest in peace. After all these years, I too will finally find peace. I haven’t forgotten him for even a moment, and nearly 60 years have passed since he was hanged.' The families of IDF soldiers Yehuda Katz and Zvi Feldman, missing since the 1982 Battle of Sultan Yacoub in Lebanon, also see a rare opportunity for resolution. Katz’s sister, Frehia Hyman, said the uprising offers renewed hope. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We have much hope. We’ve seen Lebanese prisoners released, so I keep checking footage to see if Yehuda is among them,' Hyman said, recalling signs that Katz was captured alive and noting that his tank commander was returned by Syria. 'This could be a serious turning point, but I don’t know what tomorrow will bring.' Still, Hyman voiced frustration with Israeli authorities. 'I have no trust in the state. For 43 years, we’ve been treated like enemies. But the possibility of finding Yehuda isn’t far-fetched—we’ve seen prisoners freed after decades.' Despite the passage of time, the family remains optimistic. 'I imagine his return—hugging him, smiling at him. Our family has always remained optimistic. So much time has passed but he’s still my little brother,' she said. 'Our parents passed away without this closure, but I hope they’re watching from above.' Feldman’s sister, Anat, echoed these sentiments. 'The events in Syria are a rare window of opportunity. We hope this will bring Zvika home,' she said. 'Assad and his father’s brutal regime may have held him in dark dungeons for decades.' News of inmates freed from Syrian prisons after 50 years has sparked hope. 'We’ve always said Zvika might be held somewhere. The state must act now—it’s a national responsibility,' she added. Anat noted that her family has maintained a low profile since October 7, due to the hostage situation in Gaza, but believes now is the time to push for action. 'This isn’t just about us—it’s about a tough battle where the IDF abandoned six soldiers. In 2019, they brought back the remains of Zachary Baumel who was in the tank with my brother. We want Zvika home too.' The families of other missing Israelis, including Guy Hever, also hold on to hope. Hever, a 20-year-old artillery soldier, disappeared in 1997 from his Golan Heights base, leaving no trace. Despite extensive searches, his fate remains a mystery. Hever left the base carrying his Galil rifle, but no evidence has surfaced to explain his disappearance. While his family believes he may have been abducted to Syria, no leads have confirmed his whereabouts in the 27 years since. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyoig5qvyl	2024-12-08T13:00:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/08/HJGjAIQEyx/HJGjAIQEyx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Elite units and tanks: IDF deployment across Syrian border signal...	As history unfolds, Israel strengthens its position by capturing key high points on Mount Hermon from the Assad regime, citing regional chaos as Iran’s influence wanes and Islamist forces rise in Syria In a rapid and calculated move, elite IDF units—special forces, armored brigades and paratroopers—have deployed to critical points across Syrian territory, including the summit of Mount Hermon and areas beyond the Golan Heights buffer zone. These operations, executed without resistance following the hasty retreat of Assad's forces, aim to secure key positions ahead of advancing Syrian rebel groups. IDF plans to continue these maneuvers in the coming days to strengthen its foothold in the region. Meanwhile, the Israeli Air Force is unleashing waves of strikes across Syria, including precise hits on Damascus. Among the reported targets is the 'Security Quarter' in the Syrian capital, home to Assad regime intelligence facilities and customs offices. Sources told Reuters that Israel also struck Syria's main military research center, which Iran allegedly used for missile development. IDF has described its actions as a temporary defensive deployment in the buffer zone, prompted by sightings of unidentified armed Syrians over the weekend. 'We are working to neutralize threats in Syria, where the situation is currently chaotic,' the IDF said. 'We’ve been closely monitoring developments and coordinating with other forces in the region to avoid unnecessary friction.' IDF emphasized its ongoing strikes in Syria, designed to remove immediate threats to Israel. 'Iranian influence in the region has weakened, and the Shiite axis has fractured,' the army explained. 'We are witnessing a monumental and dramatic shift. An Islamist force has risen in Syria, and we are closely observing its evolution.' Acknowledging its forces have taken strategic positions near the Syrian border, IDF explained this was a necessary move to boost regional security. Deployment was approved by senior Israeli political leadership. IDF also clarified that the rebel groups advancing in southern Syria, from Daraa to the Golan Heights, are not affiliated with the extremist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) organization led by Abu Mohammed al-Golani. 'These consist of a mix of groups with varying ideologies,' according to IDF. Meanwhile, IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi addressed new Golani Brigade recruits at the Tel Hashomer recruitment center in central Israel, highlighting the army's multi-front challenges. 'IDF is fighting on four fronts—The West Bank, Gaza, Lebanon and as of tonight, Syria,' he said. 'Soon, this responsibility will fall to you. Our excellent ground forces—infantry, armor, engineering and artillery—work together seamlessly with other branches of the IDF, including air, naval and intelligence forces. Even after a challenging year, and following a very difficult day last Simchat Torah, IDF is moving forward strongly to defend the nation.' In a significant escalation, IDF issued urgent warnings to residents in five villages near the Israeli border, urging them to remain indoors. 'Urgent warning to residents of southern Syria in the villages of Ofaniyah, Quneitra, Al-Hamidiyah, Samadaniyah Al-Sharqiyah and Al-Qahtaniyah,' wrote IDF Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee. 'The fighting in your area is forcing IDF movements, but we have no intention of harming you. For your safety, stay indoors until further notice.' The capture of Mount Hermon and control over the buffer zone were unanimously approved by the Security Cabinet. IDF reiterated that it is not intervening in Syria's internal conflict but will act decisively to safeguard the buffer zone and protect Israel and its citizens. Additionally, IDF has reportedly warned Syrian rebels in the Golan Heights, who toppled the Assad regime early Sunday, not to cross the Alpha Line, marking the start of the demilitarized zone. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held meetings in Jerusalem on Sunday with families of Israeli hostages, claiming that the fall of the Assad regime—partly due to Israel’s firm actions against Hezbollah and Hamas—could help advance negotiations for their release. Earlier, IDF ground forces entered Syrian territory, with Ynet reporting that Sayeret Shaldag, the Israeli Air Force commando unit, successfully captured the Syrian Mount Hermon summit. This strategic operation aimed to enhance IDF's control over the region, particularly on the summit, which provides unparalleled observation and fire control over other Hermon ridges. The move coincided with a wave of Israeli Air Force strikes targeting airports in Damascus and southern Syria, as well as rural areas in Daraa and Sweida, according to Arab reports. The ground capture of Mount Hermon was not an isolated event. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an oppositional-affiliated war monitor, reported that Israeli forces advanced into various locations in the Quneitra countryside, using tanks and armored vehicles to reach as far as the Al-Raqad Bridge. Israeli units reportedly approached civilian homes in Al-Hamidiyah village, north of Quneitra. Reports claim the forces shot and killed a young man from Jabatha in northern Quneitra and detained residents of Rasm al-Rawadi village, gathering them at the local school. In essence, IDF is conducting operations along a 50-mile stretch of the Syrian border, securing critical positions to prevent them from falling into the hands of armed rebels following the collapse of Assad’s forces. The most strategically significant of these locations is the Mount Hermon summit, under Assad regime control for over 50 years, and is considered a vital strategic post. Reports suggest IDF has also conducted airstrikes near Damascus, targeting weapons depots and surface-to-surface missile sites. Ynet military analyst Yossi Yehoshua noted that one target included Al-Mezzeh, a key Syrian Air Force base previously hit by Israel. Another target, according to Syrian sources, was the Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC), also known as 'CERS,' near Damascus. Although officially a civilian research institute, the SSRC has long been suspected of serving as a hub for weapons development for the Syrian military, Iran and Hezbollah, leading to its frequent targeting by Israel in recent years. The opposition-affiliated Syrian outlet Voice of the Capital reported that Israel is systematically dismantling all remnants of Assad's military infrastructure in southern Syria. This includes direct strikes on air defense systems, missile warehouses and production facilities—essentially anything connected to the development of weapons capable of threatening Israel. The outlet also claimed discussions are underway for a Russian-Israeli agreement to transfer strategic sites in rural Daraa and Quneitra, including Tel al-Hara, to Israeli control. Prime Minister Netanyahu, accompanied by Defense Minister Israel Katz, visited Mount Bental in the Golan Heights near the Syrian border Sunday morning. Northern Command ChiefcMaj. Gen. Ori Gordin briefed them on the unfolding situation. Netanyahu hailed the developments as 'a historic day in the annals of the Middle East.' 'The Assad regime, a central link in Iran's axis of evil, has fallen,' Netanyahu declared. 'This is a direct result of the blows we’ve dealt to Iran and Hezbollah, Assad’s main supporters. It has set off a chain reaction across the Middle East, as people seek to free themselves from oppressive tyranny. 'This creates significant new opportunities for Israel, though not without risks. Our primary mission is to defend our borders. For nearly 50 years, this area was designated as a buffer zone under the 1974 Disengagement Agreement. That agreement has now collapsed, with Syrian soldiers abandoning their positions.

We will not allow any hostile force to establish itself along our border.

Hundreds of Syrian children were even born here in Israel.' Meanwhile, IDF's Northern Command has raised its alert level and activated emergency defense protocols in the Golan Heights, preparing for potential threats from the east. Defense Minister Katz affirmed, 'The prime minister and I, with Cabinet approval, instructed the IDF to secure the buffer zone and key positions to ensure the safety of all Israeli communities in the Golan Heights—Jewish and Druze alike—so they are shielded from threats on the other side.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkl1fw7v1x	2024-12-08T12:13:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/08/HJfS4147VJe/HJfS4147VJe_0_143_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Poor man's cocaine': What’s next for Assad’s drug empire after h...	Syria’s booming Captagon trade fueled regime’s economy, financed Hamas and Hezbollah, and wreaked havoc on Jordan; with Assad gone, questions loom over the future of this lucrative yet destabilizing industry With recent developments on the Syrian front, questions arise about the fate of the drug empire in the country established by President Bashar Assad's regime. Captagon, the stimulant drug nicknamed 'The Islamic State’s chemical courage' and 'poor man's cocaine,' was found among the belongings and in the vehicles of Hamas terrorists during the October 7 massacre. Generating at least $5 billion annually, Captagon has been Syria's number one export. The drug financed the Syrian army and Hezbollah, while billions also flowed into the private coffers of the Assad family, Syrian army generals and Hezbollah officials. This industry financially sustained the regime as Syria's economy collapsed during the civil war, with operations rivaling the scale of major drug cartels in Mexico and South America. The man responsible for managing Captagon production in Syria was none other than Maher Assad, the former president’s brother. Until recently, Maher commanded the Syrian army's Fourth Division, often referred to as the 'Captagon Division.' However, with rebels now taking control of various Syrian provinces, Maher's focus has likely shifted to his own survival. Reports on his whereabouts remain unconfirmed, with one claiming he was last seen in Qardaha on Syria's coast, possibly planning to leave through Khmeimim Airport. A video shared on a rebel-affiliated channel also revealed an underground bunker beneath his home. The fate of Bashar Assad himself was uncertain for hours until a Kremlin source confirmed that he and his family had fled to Russia. Captagon production, supported by Iran and in collaboration with Hezbollah, formed the backbone of Assad's regime. Neighboring countries have struggled for years to thwart the relentless smuggling of drugs from Syria. The border between Jordan and Syria, spanning over 375 kilometers (235 miles), presents a particularly challenging area to monitor. Recent developments in Syria suggest that production lines may have halted, at least temporarily, as Maher faces more pressing concerns. Tensions over Captagon have extended beyond Syria's borders. Over the past year, Jordanian fighter jets have reportedly targeted facilities linked to Captagon smuggling near the Jordan-Syria border, particularly in the southwestern Sweida province. These strikes, aimed at warehouses and hubs connected to the drug trade, occasionally resulted in civilian casualties. In one January strike, ten people, including two young girls, were killed in the village of Urman in the Sweida province. Protests erupted, with residents blaming Assad's regime for turning their homes into targets for Jordanian strikes. One demonstrator held a sign accusing Assad: 'The Captagon dealer is in his palace, not in Urman or Malah [two areas targeted by airstrikes].' Hezbollah has consistently denied involvement in drug production, yet reports indicate Iran established manufacturing facilities for the group in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley, near the Syrian border. Though involved, Hezbollah has reportedly avoided placing its members in key smuggling roles. Al Jazeera reported earlier this year that Syria produces 80% of the world's Captagon supply. Jordan intercepted 65 million Captagon pills in 2022 alone, all originating from Syria. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Smuggling across the Jordanian border involves both foot traffic and drones, which are also used to transport weapons. The Jordanian army regularly highlights major smuggling busts through official media channels. Amid the ongoing upheaval alongside broader questions about Syria's future and the Assad family's fate, the issue of drug production still looms. Neighboring countries may hope for relief from this menace, but Iran remains active in the region, and Hezbollah, though weakened in recent months, remains a significant actor in the regional drug empire. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjijqvxe1e	2024-12-08T10:43:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/06/11/rkqQdL7w3/rkqQdL7w3_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Assad flees to Moscow with family, Kremlin confirms	Ousted Syrian dictator arrives in Moscow with his family and granted humanitarian asylum, Kremlin source says; Russia, Assad’s main patron, claimes he 'resigned' hours after rebels swiftly advanced into Damascus and toppled his regime Ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad has fled to Moscow, where he and his family have been granted humanitarian asylum, a Kremlin source told Russian media on Sunday. Assad’s whereabouts were uncertain for hours following the collapse of his regime, amid conflicting reports, including speculation that his plane may have crashed near Homs. Russia earlier announced that Assad had 'left Syria' after deciding to step down from the presidency. The Russian Foreign Ministry portrayed Assad’s departure as voluntary and responsible, stating that 'following negotiations with several parties to the Syrian conflict, Assad chose to resign, leave the country and provide instructions for a peaceful transfer of power.' It remains unclear when Assad arrived in Moscow. Reports emerged Saturday night that his wife, Asma, and their children had left Damascus, with confirmation on Sunday that they had traveled to the Russian capital. The whereabouts of Assad’s brother, Maher Assad, commander of the Syrian Army’s 4th Division, are also unknown, though he reportedly fled to an undisclosed location. Earlier Sunday, speculation intensified about whether Assad was still alive. Two Syrian sources told Reuters there is a 'very high likelihood' that his plane crashed shortly after takeoff from Damascus. According to the sources, the aircraft initially headed toward Syria’s coast before abruptly reversing course. Minutes later, it disappeared from radar. 'It disappeared off the radar, possibly the transponder was switched off, but I believe the bigger probability is that the aircraft was taken down...,' said one Syrian source without elaborating. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hours later, Russia confirmed Assad had left Syria. In a carefully worded statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry emphasized it had not participated in the negotiations leading to his departure. Moscow expressed deep concern over events in Syria, placing its military bases there on high alert. The ministry called for all parties to refrain from violence and resolve disputes peacefully, asserting that Russia remains in contact with Syrian opposition groups. According to a Kremlin official, opposition leaders have assured Moscow that Russian bases and diplomats in Syria are secure. The Syrians will have to manage Assad’s defeat is a blow to Russia, which has prided itself over the past decade on being a steadfast ally to its partners, in this case, the Syrian regime, and rescuing them when necessary. In recent days, however, Moscow has shown little enthusiasm for aiding Assad’s regime in its fight for survival—perhaps because it recognizes its inability to do so, particularly as it remains embroiled in the war in Ukraine. Konstantin Kosachev, deputy chairman of the upper house of Russia’s parliament, remarked this afternoon that Syrians will now have to face the prospect of a full-scale civil war on their own. The Assad regime’s downfall was completed early Sunday as rebels, led by the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), seized full control of Homs, Syria’s third-largest city, before advancing to Damascus and capturing the capital. Hours later, the rebels issued their first televised statement: 'We have liberated Damascus, toppled the Assad regime and freed all those unjustly imprisoned.' Rebels were filmed entering Assad’s palace in Damascus for the first time, removing portraits of Hezbollah’s slain leader Hassan Nasrallah and Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani from the Iranian embassy, and later ransacking and vandalizing the building. In central Damascus, crowds tore down a statue of Hafez Assad, Bashar Assad’s father and former president. By midday, reports confirmed that the reception hall of the presidential palace had been set ablaze and destroyed. Hours later, the rebels marked another historic milestone as HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani arrived in Damascus and kissed the ground. Shortly before his arrival, al-Golani delivered his first televised address on Syrian state TV, now controlled by the rebels. Once Assad’s propaganda machine, the channel broadcast al-Golani’s declaration: 'There is no turning back—we are determined to continue the path we started in 2011. The future is ours.' The fall of Assad marks a stunning conclusion to 13 years of civil war, which until recently seemed to have solidified his grip on power. The uprising against Assad began in March 2011 during the Arab Spring, but by 2015, he had lost control of most of Syria. With support from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, Assad regained territory and confined the rebels to the Idlib province in northwest Syria. More than 500,000 people were killed in the conflict, and millions of Syrians were displaced as refugees within Syria or abroad. Since 2020, Syria’s battle lines had remained largely stagnant, and Assad had regained legitimacy among many Arab and Islamic countries that previously shunned him. His survival was seen as a remarkable comeback. However, in a dramatic and unforeseen turn of events, Syrian rebels launched an offensive from Idlib into neighboring Aleppo province just 10 days ago, mere hours after a cease-fire between Israel and a weakened Hezbollah took effect. Within nine days, they captured Syria’s three largest cities—Aleppo, Hama and Homs—before advancing to Damascus and toppling the regime. This marked the end of 54 years of Assad family rule. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjccrpqeye	2024-12-08T09:54:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/25/SyaPh9yKR/SyaPh9yKR_0_96_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Russia has called for a closed-door meeting of the UN Security Council on Sunday to discuss the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the Golan Heights, according to diplomats. The request comes amid escalating tensions in the region following significant developments in Syria, including the fall of the Assad regime and reports of increased military activity near the Israel-Syria border.

Northern Gaza sees fewer clashes as IDF tightens grip on Jabaliya	Hamas resistance in Jabaliya weakens as IDF’s 162nd Division nears end of two-month operation, including raids targeting terrorists and tunnels, with 60 terrorists eliminated over weekend; fate of 70,000 displaced Gazans remains uncertain as destruction mounts Resistance of Hamas terrorists against Israel's 162nd Division during its extended raid in northern Gaza is steadily crumbling. Over the past week, the number of clashes and firefights has hit its lowest point since the IDF entered Jabaliya two months ago. This operation, spearheaded by three brigade combat teams—401st Armored Brigade, Givati Brigade and Kfir Brigade—is now closer to its conclusion than its beginning. Yet, one critical question remains: will the IDF allow tens of thousands of displaced Gaza residents, evacuated from areas like Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia, to return to their destroyed homes? So far, even in neighborhoods where operations have concluded, the army has refrained from permitting any civilians to return. If a decision to allow them back is made, international accusations of 'ethnic cleansing' could arise, though similar situations have already occurred in other areas, such as the expanded Philadelphi Corridor near Rafah and the widened Netzarim buffer zone. These areas not only divide northern and southern Gaza but have also rendered the homes of thousands of Palestinians unrecognizable. From southern neighborhoods of Gaza City to central towns like Bureij and Nuseirat, homes haven’t just been reduced to rubble—they’ve been completely obliterated, leaving vast expanses flattened by Israeli forces. The next major test in Jabaliya will center around the 'small buffer corridor' established by Israel specifically for this raid. This corridor, permanently manned by IDF troops, begins at a large forward logistics base near the coast, close to the village of Al-Atatra. This base was recently reestablished after being used for the same purpose during a maneuver last year. From there, the corridor stretches east to the Israel-Gaza border, running between Kibbutz Erez and the Black Arrow Monument, cutting through the northern third of the Gaza Strip. Should the IDF maintain its presence there in the coming month, much like it did in the expanded Netzarim buffer zone earlier this year, and possibly even widen it for 'operational needs and troop security,' it is likely that 70,000 Gaza residents will remain displaced indefinitely. This would mirror the situation of approximately one million residents of Gaza City and its surrounding areas, who have been unable to return to their homes since the war began, now living in southern Gaza's humanitarian zones. On the battlefield, IDF is steadily dismantling the last pockets of Hamas resistance in Jabaliya, particularly in the city’s adjacent refugee camp. Increasingly effective operations are being conducted with smaller numbers of troops. For instance, over the weekend, a joint force from the 9th Armored Battalion and the Givati Reconnaissance Unit launched a surprise raid on a terrorist hideout within the refugee camp. According to the 162nd Division, approximately 60 Hamas terrorists were eliminated in this operation through coordinated airstrikes and direct ground fire, all within a few hours. 'We’re conducting surprise raids that deliver swift results, systematically dismantling the enemy while leveraging the extensive operational experience of our commanders at all levels,' IDF said. Even as the Jabaliya raid nears its conclusion, operations maintain their rigorous structure: soldiers involved in the raid are rotated out regularly for rest, including time at home, with entire battalions replaced one at a time. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Meanwhile, forces from the Gaza Division’s Northern Brigade (143rd), including its engineering and elite Yahalom units, have recently completed a focused operation targeting terrorist infrastructure and underground networks in Jabaliya. 'During the operation, dozens of booby-trapped shafts and a significant number of explosives were destroyed in the area. Forces uncovered and demolished an extensive underground tunnel network stretching hundreds of meters, which Hamas terrorists used to launch attacks against our troops,' the IDF said in a statement. 'Inside the tunnels, we uncovered blast-resistant doors, living quarters and RPG launchers used for terror activities. During the operation, forces encountered terrorists emerging from the tunnels to fire anti-tank missiles. Using coordinated ground and air strikes, the forces successfully eliminated the attackers.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sylya47e1l	2024-12-08T08:46:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/04/SJ1111bViTXkg/SJ1111bViTXkg_150_196_1341_755_0_small.jpg
Jihadist leader proclaims victory in Damascus: 'We have defeated ...	Abu Mohammed al-Golani, leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, declares, 'No turning back' after Assad's fall; curfew in place amid unrest, while Iran calls for calm, and Ukraine mocks Russia: 'Dictators who bet on Putin will fall' The fall of Bashar Assad’s regime marked another historic milestone Sunday as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, leader of the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), arrived in Damascus and kissed the ground. His group spearheaded the stunning campaign that toppled Assad, ending a 13-year civil war. Shortly before his arrival, al-Golani delivered his first televised address on Syrian state TV, now controlled by the rebels. Once Assad’s propaganda machine, the channel broadcast al-Golani’s declaration: 'There is no turning back—we are determined to continue the path we started in 2011. The future is ours.' Rebels also aired their first news bulletin on state television, proclaiming victory: 'To those who once thought we were broken, we announce from Syria’s news channel the victory of the great Syrian revolution after 13 years of patience and sacrifice. We have defeated Assad, the criminal.' A curfew imposed by the rebels took effect Sunday afternoon, restricting movement in Damascus from 4 p.m. to 5 a.m. Streets began to empty as the deadline approached, though sporadic gunfire could still be heard. Concerns of security chaos loom large. Earlier in the day, anti-Assad forces stormed the homes and palaces of regime officials, including the Iranian embassy in Damascus, looting and causing significant damage. Islamist fighters also broke into the residence of Italy’s ambassador, fired shots at the walls and searched for Assad loyalists before leaving with three stolen cars. Embassy staff were unharmed. With Assad ousted, Syria’s future remains uncertain. The opposition is fragmented, comprising a wide array of factions with conflicting interests and ideologies. Fears are mounting that the country could descend into further violence. Hadi al-Bahra, leader of the Syrian opposition-in-exile in Qatar and head of the Syrian National Coalition, called for an 18-month transitional period to establish stability. 'We must create a safe, neutral and calm atmosphere to allow free elections,' he said. Al-Bahra proposed drafting a constitution within six months, followed by a referendum to determine the governance structure—whether parliamentary, presidential or mixed. 'Based on that framework, we will hold elections, and the people will choose their leaders,' he said. Russia claims Assad resigned and 'left Instructions' Russia announced that Assad had resigned and left the country, framing his departure as a responsible decision to transfer power peacefully. According to a Russian Foreign Ministry statement, Assad’s resignation came after negotiations with various factions in the Syrian conflict. 'Assad decided to step down, leave Syria, and provide guidance for a peaceful transition of power. Russia did not participate in these negotiations,' the ministry said. Moscow added that all Russian military bases in Syria are on high alert and urged all parties to refrain from violence and pursue peaceful resolutions. This development marks a significant blow to both Russia and Iran, Assad’s chief allies. Russia, which has portrayed itself as a steadfast protector of its allies over the past decade, is now facing questions about its reliability, particularly as its focus remains on the war in Ukraine. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump remarked Sunday morning that 'Assad is gone. He has fled his country. His protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer.' Ukraine’s foreign ministry also took a celebratory tone, saying, 'Dictators who bet on Putin will fall.' Iran suffers strategic loss The fall of Assad’s regime is being viewed as a major defeat for Iran, which relied on Syria as a primary smuggling corridor for weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon and as a staging ground for its militias near Israel’s border. A senior advisor to the president of the UAE said that Iran’s 'deterrence concept has been shattered by events in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria,' though he emphasized that Iran remains an important regional actor with whom dialogue is necessary. Earlier in the day, pro-Iranian militias reportedly withdrew from Syria to Iraq, and Lebanese sources told Reuters that Hezbollah forces had also exited Syria, marking the end of their decade-long presence in the country. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: An official in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps told The New York Times that the fall of Assad’s rule was a 'Berlin wall moment' for Tehran’s so-called 'Axis of Resistance,' which includes Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Houthis and other Iranian-backed terrorist groups in the region. A U.S. official similarly told CNN that the events in Syria signify the collapse of Iran’s strategy across the Middle East. Tehran’s Foreign Ministry released its first official response midday, emphasizing respect for Syria’s sovereignty and unity. 'Determining Syria’s future is a matter for the Syrian people alone,' the statement read. Iran called for an immediate end to armed conflict, the prevention of terrorist activities and the initiation of inclusive national dialogue. Despite its loss, Iran vowed to maintain its long-standing ties with Syria, describing them as 'based on wisdom and far-reaching vision.' The statement added that Iran would continue efforts to help stabilize Syria and would monitor developments closely.

Interior minister approves exception to Citizenship Law, granting dual citizenship to Oshriya and Avishai Young, mother and brother of Sgt. Elishai Young, an IDF soldier killed in combat in Gaza’s Jabaliya last October Oshriya and Avishai Young, the mother and brother of IDF Armored Corps soldier Sgt. Elishai Young, who fell in Gaza’s Jabaliya last October, will receive Israeli citizenship on Sunday. Interior Minister Moshe Arbel granted the family members the new status, allowing them to become Israeli citizens without renouncing their U.S. citizenship. Sgt. Young, 19, was killed in battle in northern Gaza alongside Staff Sgt. Ofir Berkovich and was the first fallen soldier from the Hebrew Israelite community. At his funeral, his mother mourned him, saying, 'There's no one like Elishai. He enlisted in the IDF. Whenever he returned to his family, he always told me, 'Don’t worry, I’ll come back home—nothing will happen to me.' He always told me to stay strong.' Until now, Oshriya and Avishai held permanent resident status in Israel. Members of the Hebrew Israelite community are generally granted permanent residency rather than citizenship unless they enlist in the military.

Arbel said his decision to grant citizenship to Elishai’s family reflected the unique sensitivity of the situation, as Elishai was the first fallen soldier from the Hebrew Israelite community. The decision is exceptional under Israel’s Citizenship Law, which typically requires new citizens to renounce other nationalities. However, an exception was made in this case, allowing Oshriya and Avishai to hold dual citizenship. 'Elishai Young, who gave his life for the country, is a hero. Recognizing his sacrifice is part of our moral duty. Granting citizenship to his mother and brother is a natural step. The family is part of us and always will be.

Israel captures Syrian Hermon; Netanyahu: 'This is a historic day...	IDF forces reportedly seize control of Jabal al-Sheikh outpost on Mount Hermon in Syria following withdrawal of Syrian army forces; PM: 'The Assad regime has fallen as a direct result of the blows we delivered to Iran and Hezbollah' Israel has seized control of the Jabal al-Sheikh outpost on Mount Hermon in Syria following the withdrawal of Syrian army forces, Saudi outlet Al Hadath reported Sunday. The report also claimed that Israeli forces have taken over sites in the demilitarized zone along the 1974 disengagement line between Israel and Syria. For the first time since the collapse of the Assad regime, Israeli Air Force jets launched a wave of strikes across Syria, targeting military installations, according to various reports. The attacks included strikes on the Al Mazzeh military airport in Damascus, the Halhala region in southern Syria—home to a major airport—and rural areas in Daraa and Sweida provinces. The Voice of the Capital, a Syrian opposition-affiliated outlet, reported that Israel is conducting systematic attacks on military brigades and air defense systems formerly operated by the Assad regime. The site reported that 'Israel is systematically destroying all brigades, battalions, missile depots, and weapons development facilities that could threaten its security.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Foreign reports also indicated that Israeli strikes over the weekend targeted advanced weapons stockpiles, production facilities and a chemical weapons depot near Damascus. An unnamed Syrian opposition source claimed that additional targets are expected to be destroyed imminently. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the Mount Bental area in the Golan Heights near the border on Sunday morning. Accompanied by Defense Minister Israel Katz, Netanyahu received a briefing from Northern Command chief Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin. 'This is a historic day in the annals of the Middle East,' Netanyahu declared. 'The Assad regime is a central link in Iran’s axis of evil, and this regime has fallen. This is a direct result of the blows we delivered to Iran and Hezbollah, the primary supporters of Assad's regime. This has created a chain reaction throughout the Middle East among those seeking to free themselves from this oppressive and tyrannical regime.' Netanyahu added that while the developments present significant opportunities for Israel, they are not without risks. 'We are first and foremost acting to secure our borders. This area was defined for nearly 50 years as a buffer zone under the 1974 Disengagement Agreement, which has now collapsed. Syrian forces have abandoned their posts.' He stated: 'Together with the defense minister, and with full backing from the cabinet, I instructed the IDF yesterday to take control of the buffer zone and the nearby dominant positions. We will not allow any hostile force to establish a presence on our border. At the same time, we are pursuing a policy of good neighborliness, the same approach we maintained when we set up a field hospital here that treated thousands of Syrians injured during the civil war. Hundreds of Syrian children were born here in Israel.' In response to the escalating conflict, the IDF announced Sunday that it had reinforced its presence in the demilitarized buffer zone near the Golan Heights to prevent potential incursions into Israeli territory. 'The IDF is not intervening in the events in Syria but will act as necessary to protect the State of Israel and its citizens,' the army said in a statement. The IDF also issued warnings to rebel forces occupying parts of the Syrian Golan Heights, urging them not to cross the Alpha Line into the demilitarized zone. Concurrently, the Northern Command has elevated its alert level and activated emergency measures to bolster Golan Heights defenses against potential threats from the east. Defense Minister Katz, speaking from the Golan Heights, said: 'The prime minister and I, with Cabinet approval, directed the IDF to take control of the buffer zone and strategic positions to ensure the safety of all Israeli communities in the Golan Heights—Jewish and Druze alike—so that they are not exposed to threats from across the border.' Hezbollah withdraws from Syria amid rebel gains Security sources in Lebanon reported that Hezbollah, a key ally of the ousted Assad regime, has withdrawn its forces from Syria. Syrian military sources told Reuters that Hezbollah troops evacuated from al-Qusayr, a strategic city in Homs province, shortly before it fell to rebel forces. At least 150 armored vehicles carrying hundreds of Hezbollah fighters reportedly left al-Qusayr in stages. The city, which Hezbollah had controlled since 2013, served as a key route for the movement of weapons and fighters between Syria and Lebanon.

Where in the world is Assad? Russia claims he stepped down and le...	Rebel sources tell CNN a search for the ousted leader is underway and military and intelligence officials are being questioned; other sources say plane movements on radar are inexplicable and it may have been shot down Hours after the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, the whereabouts of Bashar Assad remain unknown and, according to some reports, he may have been killed. As rebel troops entered Damascus early on Sunday, the deposed leader's plane was seen taking off toward the coast, according to reports, but then it disappeared from the radar near Homs after it made a U-turn. Two Syrian sources told Reuters that the plane may have crashed but that has not been confirmed, and Russia said Assad had left the country after 'deciding to step down.' CNN reported citing rebel sources that there is a search underway for Assad and that Syrian military officers and intelligence officials are being questioned. An advisor to the UAE government said he did not know where Assad was and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said he could not comment on the deposed leader's whereabouts but said he was likely outside Syria, although he could not be sure. As questions regarding Assad's safety continued, two Syrian sources told Reuters that there was a 'high probability' that his plane crashed after takeoff. They explained that the strange U-turn that was observed and the subsequent disappearance from the radar was inexplicable and could be because the plan's transponder was turned off, although the possibility of a the plane being shot down, was more likely. Assad's escape from Damascus followed his wife and children's departure days earlier. There is also no knowledge of the whereabouts of his defense minister. Assad's brother Maher, who commanded the 4th division of the military, charged with defending the capital, also escaped, probably to the Syrian coast, an area that has not yet been taken by rebel forces. He was expected to use the local airport to leave the country. The fall of the Assad regime marks the end of the 13-year long civil war that began during the Arab Spring. Over half a million people died in the war and millions of Syrians were displaced, some becoming refugees in their own land and others seeking shelter abroad.

Journalist Nur Golan says Syrians want to rebuild their country and live in peace and stability; Opposition activist accuses UN of ignoring the suffering of Syrians and working for Iran, Russia Syrian journalist in exile Noor Golani, like many other of his countrymen who escaped the Assad regime during the civil war, was making plans to return home after living in Germany. In an interview with Ynet he said he had been watching events unfold and was pleased to see the regime fall, as he had long hopes and believed it would and claimed the rebel forces refrained from harm to civilians as they advanced. 'Thank God all the detainees were freed from jail. Many Syrians waited for their children to be released. Some had been imprisoned for years and they were never informed,' he said. 'I did not sleep. This is the first morning of the post-Assad era. There is no Assad, no Iran, no Ba'ath Party. It is the best morning I have had.' Golani said his father was murdered by the regime. 'I am glad that my father's murderer was toppled. The person who destroyed the country and killed two million Syrians is gone. Syria has been returned to its people,' he said. He also sent a message to Israelis, to calm concerns, although the developments in the wake of the fall of Assad, are not yet known. 'The Syria people want to build a country that respects its citizens, with institutions, without war and destruction, only peace,' he said in the interview. 'I understand the concern of Israelis over what is happening in Syria but it is the regime that caused everything,' he said. 'There was cooperation in the region in the past. There will be no violations and no attacks. It was a stable region. The Syrian regime brought in the militias and all the problems. It was the problem. Now, I tell you there will be stability,' he said. 'I want to give a message to Israel, that we do not want war and division. We want peace. Do not fear the Syrian people,' he said. In a separate interview, Syrian opposition member Yahya al Kurdi could not hide his joy and, like many other Syrians in exile, was celebrating the fall of Assad's regime. 'There will be a new life for 20 million people, he said. 'For 50 years the regime has killed Syrians,' he told Ynet. He thanked Turkey for taking in millions of refugees from Syria and also thanked Israel and president-elect Donald Trump. 'The future of Syria will be a joint one for all factions,' he said. 'Syria is not Lebanon, Yemen or Iran and the opposition is not heading in different directions. Israel helped us indirectly by weakening Hezbollah.

This is the Assad family, whose 54 year-regime has just ended	Called to succeed his father after the designated heir, brother Basel is killed, Bashar al-Assad takes the leadership bringing hope of reforms but those end quickly as the young dictator continues the hard hand of his father For 54 years Syria was under the rule of the Assads after Hafez al-Assad took power in 1970. After his death in 2000, he was succeeded by his son, Bashar, who was toppled early on Sunday as rebel forces entered Damascus at the end of their whirlwind assault and while the Syrian military laid down its arms without a fight. Hafez Assad was born October 6, 1930 in a remote village to a family from the Muslim Alawite sect. He was educated in boarding school in Latakia and led a modest life far away from his family. He joined a military academy in Hama at the age of 19 and worked himself up the ranks until he became commander of the Syrian air force in 1965. A year later he was already the minister of defense, a position he held in the 1967 Six-Day War when Syria suffered a crushing defeat. Still he managed to rise to the leadership of the Ba'ath Party and stage a coup, becoming president of Syria with the support of the military. In 1982, Hafez Assad massacred tens of thousands of his people in Hama to prevent an uprising of the Muslim Brotherhood against him and ordered mass executions and torture of prisoners. That same year, and after the civil war in neighboring Lebanon, the Syrian ruler moved troops across the border to assist the Palestinian's fight against Israel and forced a government that had to agree to a constitutional change that gave Lebanese Muslims a greater role in governing. Human rights groups have for years reported on mass arrests of political prisoners in Assad's Syria, jailed without trial. He held on to his power by violent force that included purges and assassination of his opponents. Assad entered peace negotiations with Israel for the first time in 1991, soon after the first Gulf war. The talks continued during the governments of Izhak Rabin, Shimon Peres, Benjamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak and included a possible Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. They finally ended after a disagreement over a few hundred meters along the Sea of Galilee during the Barak term. The third son of Hafaz Assad, Bashar, who was born in 1965, became Syria's leader after his brother, Basel, who was designated to succeed his father, was killed in a car crash. Bashar, who had been trained as an ophthalmologist in the UK, was called to take his brother's place. Bashar Assad began his preparation for leadership by first joining the Syrian Medical Corps as a captain in 1994. He was quickly promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and, after a short period of combat training, was assigned to head the elite Republican Guard Battalion, a position Basel held when he was killed, while his father purged middle level military officers who would pose any possible opposition to his son's rule. Bashar was given more senior positions between 1998 and his father's death in 2000, primarily overseeing Syria's role in Lebanon and its negotiations with Israel. When Hafez died, Bashar took power at the young age of 34, bringing with him the hope of Syrians for a more pro-Western regime under a Western educated leader who promised reforms. But those hopes quickly ended after Bashar began his own purge of possible opponents. A few months into his rule, he married Asma, who was from a Sunni family in Homs, but was raised in the UK. They couple have three children. Bashar was implicated in the murder of Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri in 2005 by members of Hezbollah. An international investigation five years later revealed the Syrian government's involvement in the assassination. After large protests in Lebanon, Syria was forced to remove its troops from Lebanese soil dealing the regime the first in a number of blows. The uprising that began in Syria in 2011 and was fought for over a decade ultimately led to the end of the Assad rule. By some estimations, over 600,000 Syrians died in the civil war. During the first years, Bashar Assad lost control of most of the Syrian territory, including to the hands of ISIS, that conquered vast areas in both Syria and Iraq. In 2015, with the active military involvement of Russia, he was able to regain control of most of the land that had been lost. Over six million Syrians were displaced from their homes. Many became refugees who sought safety in Europe, leading to a crisis that has altered the political face of many of the continent's countries. It was the largest migration of refugees since World War II. Assad and his enemies were both accused of war crimes and the Syrian dictator was said to have used chemical weapons, numerous times against the forces fighting his regime and the civilians in the areas that they controlled.

Australia's PM says Melbourne synagogue arson appears to be terro...	Prime Minister Anthony Albanese statement two says after the blaze that destroyed the Adass Israel synagogue comes after Benjamin Netanyahu said the crime was motivated by the Australian government's anti-Israel policies Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Sunday that suspected arson at a Melbourne synagogue appeared to be an act of terror, a day after Benjamin Netanyahu said the Labor government had motivated the crime with anti-Israel policies. 'The atrocities that occurred at the synagogue in Melbourne clearly were designed to create fear in the community and therefore from my personal perspective certainly fulfil that definition of terrorism,' Albanese said at a press conference in Perth. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that the Adass Israel synagogue blaze, which broke out early on Friday, could not be separated from the 'anti-Israel spirit' of Albanese's center-left government whose policies include support of a recent U.N. motion backing a Palestinian state. Australia's government defended its record on antisemitism, saying on Saturday that since Albanese took office in May 2022 the government has provided A$25 million to upgrade security at Jewish sites including schools, banned the Nazi salute and taken action against hate speech. Laws passed last year also banned public displays of terror group symbols.

IDF moves armor, troops into demilitarized zone on Golan Heights	Military says will protect against any violation of Israel sovereignty after warning Syrian rebels taking control of the area near the border, not to advance The IDF on Sunday moved tanks and infantry troops into the demilitarized zone along the Israel-Syria border on the Golan Heights after the fall of the Assad regime, according to foreign media reports. The move is part of the military's emergency plan to prevent any incursion of Syrian rebel forces into Israeli territory. On Saturday the military said it had reinforced its deployment along the border, including intelligence and reconnaissance units.

Assad leaves Damascus as rebels enter Syrian capital	Intense sounds of shooting were heard in the center of the Damascus eye witnesses say although it was not immediately clear what the source of the shooting is Syrian President Bashar al-Assad boarded a plane and left Damascus for an unknown destination on Sunday, two senior army officers told Reuters, as rebels said they had entered the capital with no sign of army deployments. Thousands in cars and on foot congregated at a main square in Damascus waving and chanting 'Freedom', witnesses said. 'We celebrate with the Syrian people the news of freeing our prisoners and releasing their chains and announcing the end of the era of injustice in Sednaya prison,' said the rebels. Sednaya is a large military prison on the outskirts Damascus where the Syrian government detained thousands. Just hours earlier, rebels announced they had gained full control of the key city of Homs after only a day of fighting, leaving Assad's 24-year rule dangling by a thread. Intense sounds of shooting were heard in the center of the Damascus, two residents said on Sunday, although it was not immediately clear what the source of the shooting was. In rural areas southwest of the capital, local youths and former rebels took advantage of the loss of authority to come to the streets in acts of defiance against the Assad family's authoritarian rule. Thousands of Homs residents poured onto the streets after the army withdrew from the central city, dancing and chanting 'Assad is gone, Homs is free' and 'Long live Syria and down with Bashar al-Assad'. Rebels fired into the air in celebration, and youths tore down posters of the Syrian president, whose territorial control has collapsed in a dizzying week-long retreat by the military. The fall of Homs gives the insurgents control over Syria's strategic heartland and a key highway crossroads, severing Damascus from the coastal region that is the stronghold of Assad's Alawite sect and where his Russian allies have a naval base and air base. Homs' capture is also a powerful symbol of the rebel movement's dramatic comeback in the 13-year-old conflict. Swathes of Homs were destroyed by gruelling siege warfare between the rebels and the army years ago. The fighting ground down the insurgents, who were forced out. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham commander Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the main rebel leader, called the capture of Homs a historic moment and urged fighters not to harm 'those who drop their arms'. Rebels freed thousands of detainees from the city prison. Security forces left in haste after burning their documents. Residents of numerous Damascus districts turned out to protest Assad on Saturday evening, and security forces were either unwilling or unable to clamp down. Syrian rebel commander Hassan Abdul Ghani said in a statement early Sunday that operations were ongoing to 'completely liberate' the countryside around Damascus and rebel forces were looking toward the capital. In one suburb, a statue of Assad's father, the late President Hafez al-Assad, was toppled and torn apart. The Syrian army said it was reinforcing around Damascus, and state television reported on Saturday that Assad remained in the city. Outside the city, rebels swept across the entire southwest over 24 hours and established control. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Existential threat to Assad rule The fall of Homs and threat to the capital pose an immediate existential danger to the Assad dynasty's five-decade reign over Syria and the continued influence there of its main regional backer, Iran. The pace of events has stunned Arab capitals and raised fears of a new wave of regional instability. Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Russia issued a joint statement saying the crisis was a dangerous development and calling for a political solution. But there was no indication they agreed on any concrete steps, with the situation inside Syria changing by the hour. Syria's civil war, which erupted in 2011 as an uprising against Assad's rule, dragged in big outside powers, created space for jihadist militants to plot attacks around the world and sent millions of refugees into neighboring states. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the strongest rebel group, is the former al Qaeda affiliate in Syria regarded by the U.S. and others as a terrorist organization, and many Syrians remain fearful it will impose draconian Islamist rule. Golani has tried to reassure minorities that he will not interfere with them and the international community that he opposes Islamist attacks abroad. In Aleppo, which the rebels captured a week ago, there have not been reports of reprisals. When asked on Saturday whether he believed Golani, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov replied, 'The proof of the pudding is in the eating'. Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group withdrew from the Syrian city of Qusayr on the border with Lebanon before rebel forces seized it, Syrian army sources said on Sunday. At least 150 armored vehicles carrying hundreds of Hezbollah fighters left the city, long a point on the route for arms transfers and fighters moving in and out of Syria, the sources said. Israel hit one of the convoys as it was departing, one source said. Allies' role in supporting Assad Assad long relied on allies to subdue the rebels. Russian warplanes conducted bombing while Iran sent allied forces including Hezbollah and Iraqi militia to reinforce the Syrian military and storm insurgent strongholds. But Russia has been focused on the war in Ukraine since 2022 and Hezbollah has suffered big losses in its own grueling war with Israel, significantly limiting its ability or that of Iran to bolster Assad. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has said the U.S. should not be involved in the conflict and should 'let it play out'. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rknqrtzeke	2024-12-07T18:30:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/07/HydW8ZGVyl/HydW8ZGVyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Pentagon leak delayed Israeli strike on Iran, court documents con...	Prosecutors reveal leaked classified documents forced Israel to delay planned strike on Iran; despite evidence, suspect placed under house arrest; his motives remain unclear U.S. prosecutors argued in court that the leak of classified documents delayed a planned Israeli military operation against Iran. Troy Edwards, the lead prosecutor, said the disclosure prompted Israel to postpone a 'kinetic action' out of concern that its plans had been compromised. Despite presenting incriminating evidence against the alleged leaker, Asif William Rahman, 34, a federal judge ordered his release to home detention under electronic monitoring. The Justice Department announced plans to appeal the decision, arguing that although Rahman no longer has access to classified materials, his memory of sensitive information could still pose a national security threat. Prosecutors stressed that 'memory and perception' alone are sufficient for the unauthorized sharing of classified data, even through simple means like verbal communication. Rahman, an Ohio native and Yale graduate, was arrested in Cambodia while allegedly attempting to delete classified files and enhance the security of his digital devices. He is accused of leaking two classified documents from secure systems. Officials have not disclosed his motives, which remain unclear. Documents labeled 'Top Secret' The two classified documents were leaked in October during Israel's preparations for a strike on Iran, following a barrage of ballistic missiles launched by the Islamic Republic on October 1. According to at least one foreign media report, denied at the time by Israel, the leak delayed Israel's response, which ultimately came three weeks later in an operation dubbed 'Days of Atonement.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The documents, dated October 15 and 16, were classified as 'Top Secret' and first surfaced on a pro-Iranian Telegram channel before spreading to X (formerly Twitter). They were produced by the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), which analyzes data and imagery collected by American spy satellites. Their security classification restricts sharing to the Five Eyes alliance, an intelligence-sharing partnership between the U.S., Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The documents, which do not include the satellite images referenced, detail Israeli preparations for an attack on Iran. They reportedly describe the Israeli Air Force conducting 'a large-scale deployment drill' and an aerial refueling exercise.

Syrian rebels announce full control of Homs, push toward Damascus...	Syrian army reportedly retreats as rebels rally toward capital; US officials predict Assad's regime could fall 'by next week'; Iran reportedly evacuated senior IRGC commanders; Assad denies fleeing, but his location remains unknown Syrian rebels declared early Sunday that they have seized full control of Homs, Syria’s third-largest city, just a day after entering it. Rebel forces are now advancing toward Damascus, with reports indicating they already hold parts of the capital's suburbs. The rapid developments over the weekend have intensified speculation that President Bashar al-Assad's regime is nearing collapse. Abu Mohammed al-Golani, leader of the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), hailed the 'historic moment' in a statement and urged his fighters not to harm Syrian soldiers who surrender. Meanwhile, a rebel-aligned television channel reported that Assad regime officials are fleeing Damascus. Assad's office denied rumors that the president had left the capital, following reports that his wife and children fled to Russia, a key ally. However, CNN cited sources claiming that Assad's location is unknown and that his presidential guard has vacated his palace. The rebel offensive, launched just over a week ago following a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, has caught the Syrian military off guard. After years of stalemate in the civil war, the rebels have swiftly overrun key territories. They began their campaign in northern Syria, capturing Aleppo, the country’s second-largest city, before advancing southward to seize Hama. Now in control of Homs, an important strategic hub, the rebels' momentum is raising alarm among Assad's allies, Russia and Iran, and prompting regional powers, including Israel, to assess the implications of the regime's potential downfall. Analysts suggest Assad’s survival is in doubt if Homs remains in rebel hands. Hezbollah fighters flee Homs: 'The city can no longer be defended' Syrian rebel forces announced Saturday that they have seized control of a prison in central Homs, freeing more than 3,500 inmates. Throughout the evening, residents reported long convoys of soldiers leaving the city. A Syrian army official confirmed the retreat, describing a 'large convoy' that had withdrawn. Thousands were later seen celebrating in Homs, chanting for the end of Assad's regime. A Syrian military officer told Reuters that dozens of Hezbollah fighters from the elite Radwan Force fled Homs after concluding, in coordination with the army, that 'the city can no longer be defended.' Meanwhile, the Syrian Defense Ministry issued a statement denying the rebels had entered Homs, insisting, 'The situation is stable and secure, with our forces deployed around the city in impenetrable defensive positions.' U.S. officials told CNN that the Biden administration believes the fall of the Assad regime could be imminent following the rebels' advances. 'The emerging consensus is that is an increasingly plausible scenario,' one senior U.S. official told CNN. 'Probably by next weekend the Assad regime will have lost any semblance of power,' another official said. Earlier, President-elect Donald Trump reiterated that Washington must not intervene in Syria, saying, 'This is not America's fight.' 'Assad offered to sever ties with Hezbollah to the US' Bloomberg reported Saturday that Assad is seeking a deal to secure his hold on power and, given the current battlefield realities, is open to engaging with the United States. According to the report, Assad, through mediation by the United Arab Emirates, proposed that Syria sever all ties with Iran-backed proxies like Hezbollah if Western powers exert pressure to end the fighting and rebel offensives. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On Saturday afternoon, reports emerged that rebel forces had reached the 'gates of Damascus.' The Syrian military later said that it was bolstering defenses around the capital and engaging rebel forces in multiple areas. Syrian Interior Minister Mohammad al-Rahmoun declared, 'Damascus is heavily fortified, and no one can breach its security.' HTS leader Golani said Saturday that rebel forces 'have begun encircling' Damascus and are now less than 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the city’s southern entrance. Addressing his fighters, he proclaimed, 'Damascus awaits you.' 2,000 Syrian soldiers flee to Iraq Rebel forces opposing the Assad regime have intensified their operations across southern Syria, reportedly taking control of three provinces: Daraa, Sweida and Quneitra, the latter near the Israeli border. In eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border, Kurdish rebels seized the city of Deir ez-Zor and its border crossing over the weekend. Reports on Saturday revealed that approximately 2,000 Syrian army soldiers fled the country, crossing into Iraq through the Deir ez-Zor border point. The mayor of the Iraqi border town of al-Qaim claimed that the soldiers are seeking refuge, with some requiring medical attention due to injuries. In response to these developments, the foreign ministers of Russia, Iran and Turkey convened Saturday to affirm the importance of Syria’s territorial integrity and discuss resuming political negotiations to resolve the crisis. While Turkey supports certain rebel factions, Russia and Iran continue backing Assad’s regime. Russian aircraft have been conducting strikes against rebel positions across Syria, and pro-Iranian militias have entered Syria following the surprise offensive. A Hezbollah-affiliated source disclosed that the organization, recovering from a year of fighting with Israel, has dispatched 2,000 fighters to Syria to bolster Assad’s forces against the rebels. Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported Saturday that Iran, a key ally of Assad, has begun evacuating senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commanders from Syria following the fall of Hama to rebel forces on Thursday. An Iraqi official told the Post that Tehran is also removing nonessential diplomats and their families from Damascus, citing fears that Assad’s regime may collapse and leave Iranian personnel 'trapped' in the country. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1olp8f41l	2024-12-07T15:08:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/07/rJedfSMVke/rJedfSMVke_0_80_702_396_0_small.jpg

IDF says helping UN forces repel attack in southern Syria	Armed assailants attack UN outpost near village of Hader in Quneitra province, close to Israel's Golan Heights; rebels reportedly enter Homs and approach gates of Damascus The IDF reported Saturday that armed assailants targeted a United Nations outpost near the village of Hader in Quneitra province, close to Israel's Golan Heights. Israeli forces assisted UN personnel in repelling the attack. The development comes as rebel factions in Syria make rapid territorial gains in the south. Rebels announced the capture of Quneitra province near the Israeli border, as well as the southern provinces of Sweida and Daraa. Earlier Saturday, opposition groups reported taking control of Sanamayn, a city 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Damascus, after entering the birthplace of the 2011 uprising, Daraa, last weekend. The offensive, spearheaded by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and joined by other factions, began with surprise attacks on Assad regime forces in northern provinces, including Aleppo and Idlib. HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani told CNN, 'Our goal is to topple the regime by any means necessary.' Rebel forces have since seized key cities in central Syria. After capturing Aleppo, the country’s second-largest city, they advanced southward, taking Hama and pushing into Homs, Syria’s third-largest city and a crucial crossroads connecting many provinces. Pro-Assad forces have launched airstrikes and dispatched reinforcements to Homs, but analysts suggest the fall of the city could be a turning point threatening the regime's survival. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Meanwhile, opposition reports indicate that rebels are within a few miles of Damascus, with some claiming they are 'at the gates of the capital.' Pro-regime sources denied rebel forces were near the capital but confirmed withdrawals from surrounding towns. In the east, Kurdish rebels reportedly captured Deir ez-Zor and the Iraqi border crossing at Al-Bukamal. Local officials in Iraq said approximately 2,000 Syrian soldiers fled to Iraq seeking asylum, with some requiring medical attention. In Damascus, rumors circulated about President Bashar al-Assad's departure amid rebel advances. His office dismissed such claims, stating he remains in the capital performing his duties. Nonetheless, reports suggest Egyptian and Jordanian officials have urged Assad to leave Syria and establish a government-in-exile. A Wall Street Journal report claims Assad's wife, Asma, and their children left for Russia last week. In southern Syria, footage emerged of protesters in Jaramana, a predominantly Druze city 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Damascus, toppling a statue of Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father. Demonstrators called for the regime’s downfall, and security forces were deployed to protect government buildings. The foreign ministers of Russia, Iran and Turkey met on Saturday to reaffirm the importance of Syria’s territorial integrity and agreed to renew efforts toward a political resolution to the ongoing crisis. The meeting highlighted the complex alliances in the Syrian conflict: Turkey supports certain rebel factions, while Russia and Iran back the Assad regime. Russian aircraft continue to conduct airstrikes against rebels across Syria, and pro-Iranian militias have entered the country following the recent surprise offensive. A source close to Hezbollah revealed that the group, recovering from a year of fighting with Israel, has deployed 2,000 fighters to Syria to support Assad’s forces in battles against the rebels. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday ruled out intervention in the Syrian conflict. 'Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!' he wrote on his social media platform Truth Social, ahead of his January 20 inauguration. Currently, approximately 900 U.S. troops remain stationed in Syria. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1i1mgge1g	2024-12-07T07:25:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/07/BkU0Fob4yx/BkU0Fob4yx_2_0_1279_720_0_small.jpg

Iran's nuclear leap 'extremely serious,' hurts diplomacy, Western...	Iran's acceleration in its enrichment of uranium to close to bomb grade is 'extremely serious,' has no civilian justification and contradicts Tehran's assertions on wanting serious nuclear negotiations, a Western diplomatic source said on Saturday. UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi told Reuters on Friday that Iran was dramatically accelerating its enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the about 90% level that is weapons grade. The International Atomic Energy Agency later confirmed in a confidential report to member states that Iran was speeding up uranium enrichment, a process that refines the raw material so that it can be used as fuel in civil nuclear power generation or, potentially, nuclear weapons. 'The information reported by the Director General of the Agency, indicating a significant increase in Iran's capacity to produce highly enriched uranium at 60%, is extremely serious,' the Western diplomatic source told Reuters. 'These measures have no credible civilian justification and could, on the contrary, directly fuel a military nuclear program if Iran were to take the decision... They are in contradiction with Iran's declarations on its willingness to return to credible negotiations.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjcleyfn1g	2024-12-07T06:07:17-08:00

Israeli campaign accusing UNRWA of terrorism appears in Times Squ...	Israeli Foreign Ministry launches a global campaign accusing UNRWA of ties to terrorism, sparking UN condemnation; The controversial campaign highlights alleged links between UNRWA employees and terror activities, following Israeli move to end the agency's operations within its borders The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) is furious with Israel's Foreign Ministry over an aggressive campaign aimed at portraying the organization as complicit in terrorism. The campaign, which includes slogans such as 'Do you support humanitarian aid free of terror?' and 'Paychecks to terrorists or humanitarian aid?', features an image of a masked man wearing an UNRWA badge in Hamas colors. The ads have been displayed on billboards around the UN headquarters in New York and in Times Square. UN's response was soon to follow. The organization issued an official statement on Friday condemning the campaign, accusing the Israeli government of launching a 'global disinformation campaign targeting UNRWA.' The statement claimed that 'the actions of Israel, a member state of the UN, labeling UNRWA as a terrorist organization could be interpreted as hate speech. Through Google advertisements and billboards worldwide, the campaign is causing significant damage to UNRWA’s reputation.' David Saranga, head of the digital department at Israel's Foreign Ministry and Deputy Director General for Public Diplomacy, responded to the UN’s statement. 'Here’s just one of many examples connecting UNRWA to terrorism,' he wrote. 'Meet Faisal Ali Muslim, a UN aid worker who participated in the October 7 massacre. He is a social worker by profession, and on that day, he was filmed loading the body of an Israeli civilian, who had been shot, into his vehicle at Kibbutz Be’eri. UNRWA has lost its legitimacy and can no longer function as an arm of the UN.' The Foreign Ministry’s campaign has resonated on social media, leading to many criticizing the organization and sharing content linking it to terrorism, particularly highlighting the involvement of its employees in the October 7 massacre. Sources in the Foreign Ministry told Ynet there is no intention to halt the campaign, which has reached tens of millions within just two days. According to these sources, the goal is to amplify the campaign's content and reach, aiming to convince decision-makers of the need to find an alternative to the aid agency, whose many members are reportedly involved in terrorist activities, as demonstrated in the events of October 7. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In October, the Israeli Knesset passed a law in its second and third readings to cease UNRWA operations in Israel. The proposal, supported by 92 members of Knesset and opposed by 10, was spearheaded by MK Boaz Bismuth, MK Sharren Haskel, MK Eli Dallal, and other lawmakers. According to the law, UNRWA will no longer operate any offices, provide any services, or conduct any activities, directly or indirectly, within Israel’s sovereign territory. This effectively ends UNRWA’s operations in East Jerusalem, transferring its responsibilities and authority to the Israeli government. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjfksabnkl	2024-12-07T04:15:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/07/Hk22gnZV1e/Hk22gnZV1e_0_531_1080_608_0_small.jpg
On Israel's doorstep: Sunni rebels capture Quneitra in southern S...	Following unprecedented advances by HTS and other rebel groups in the cities of Hama and Daraa, sources confirm they have taken over Quneitra province in southern Syria, a stone throw away from the Israeli border; IDF is 'calling up additional forces for defensive missions in the Golan Heights area, adjacent to the Israel-Syria border' The Syrian civil war has entered a critical phase, with rebels gaining significant ground against the Assad regime. On Saturday, Syrian opposition forces, spearheaded by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham and its leader Abu Mohammad al-Julani, announced their capture of Quneitra province, located near the Israeli border. Reuters corroborated the development, citing rebel sources and a Syrian government official. Concurrently, Sunni rebels reported taking control of Al-Sanamayn, a city in the rural Daraa region in southern Syria. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based opposition group, further confirmed the Assad regime had lost control of Daraa province. Earlier, the Syrian army announced a 'redeployment' of its forces in Daraa and As-Suwayda in southern Syria. Meanwhile, the opposition-aligned news outlet 'Voice of the Capital' reported the withdrawal of Assad’s troops and Iranian-backed militias from Palmyra in central Syria and parts of the expansive Syrian desert. The outlet also noted that Hezbollah had pulled its forces from rural areas of Quneitra, even as sources close to the Shiite militant group revealed it had deployed 2,000 fighters to Syria to bolster Assad’s forces. In a related development, Saudi Arabia’s Al-Hadath channel, citing an Iraqi security source, reported that hundreds of pro-Iranian militia members had retreated from Syria toward the Al-Qaim border crossing, which connects Syria and Iraq. Separately, reports from southern Syria indicated rebels negotiated with Assad regime forces to secure control of the Al-Thaala airport near As-Suwayda without any armed confrontation. The battle for Homs looms large. According to Rami Abdul Rahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, control of Homs could determine the conflict’s trajectory. 'Once Homs falls, the regime will collapse,' he remarked. Capturing Homs would allow rebels to sever the primary route to Syria’s coastal regions, a stronghold of the Alawite-dominated regime. Rebel forces have already reached the gates of Homs, issuing what they described as a 'final call' for Assad’s forces to defect before they enter the city. This surge in rebel advances follows the Assad regime’s recent losses. Over the past week, Sunni rebels captured Aleppo and Hama, bringing them closer to Homs. Even before the potential fall of Homs, the Syrian opposition achieved a symbolic milestone by entering the city of Daraa for the first time since 2011, the year the uprising against Assad began. Rebel leaders disclosed that their takeover of Daraa, near the Jordanian border, was facilitated by an agreement allowing regime forces a safe withdrawal while avoiding encounters with Assad’s senior officials. Amid these developments, the Wall Street Journal reported that Egyptian and Jordanian officials urged Assad to leave the country and establish a government-in-exile. While Assad remains in Syria, many of his family members have reportedly relocated. According to the report, based on Arab and security sources, Assad’s wife Asma and their children recently left for Russia, while other family members have sought refuge in the UAE.

The Israeli facialist of Kim Kardashian and Julia Roberts: 'I wil...	After making the headlines thanks to one Kim Kardashian, the A-list facialist Keren Bartov talks about the golden advice she took from her good friend Gal Gadot and the surprising $2 million worth gift she received When she just set off, her parents asked her to keep her job secret, and to this day her English is not fluent, but none of these prevented the renowned aesthetician, Keren Bartov from becoming the woman responsible for the skin care of some of the most beautiful and famous faces in the world - from Jennifer Lopez to Lily Collins. After making the headlines thanks to one, Kim Kardashian, she talks about the golden advice she took from her good friend Gal Gadot and the surprising $2 million worth gift she received Last month, Kim Kardashian caused a stir on the network, when she shared a snapshot on Instagram with cosmetic entrepreneur Keren Bartov who had just made her skin smooth and glowing. Later Kim shared another story in which she advertised the line of skincare products bearing the name of that facial revitalizer: Keren Bartov. The 360 million followers of one of the most influential women in the world were exposed to the Israeli facialist, who was sure that this visit would remain confidential. This is a really good story for the children and the shocked clientele in Israel. However one cannot argue with the fact that the value of such an advertisement is estimated at over two million dollars. Not including VAT, I guess. 'I was at Kim's house in Los Angeles and she was very satisfied with the facial treatment, telling me that it was the best she has ever experienced, recalls Bartov from her Israeli clinic located in Tel Aviv. 'I saw her taking pictures of the products, asking also for a selfie with me; I thought it was for her to keep. I went to bed after spending a long day at work which started early in the morning, and suddenly I received an overwhelming number of messages on my phone, 'Keren, wake up, Kim Kardashian tagged you'. This has never happened to me before, not even on my wedding day. Everyone I know, people that I haven't seen in 20 years texted to congratulate me; tens of thousands of followers complimented me, saying I was 'an inspiration', and 'amazing' and that 'I made them cry, seeing an Israeli who has come this far, especially today. People said they wanted to book a treatment. It was a huge thing for me. I haven't seen Kim tagging a facialist before. My heart was palpitating before I got to Kim Kardashian's, but as soon as I entered her house, I acted very professionally. There is no room for mistakes, and even if I am excited, I say it out loud, to break the ice. Kim is very, very beautiful, kind, agreeable, very simple, behaving like an ordinary, regular person.' It's pretty crazy. She is a very influential woman. 'Yes it's crazy. I'm speechless, I never imagined this would happen; I treat a lot of Hollywood stars, and I never ask them to tag me, there's nothing more embarrassing than that. They may do that when they're very satisfied, or after undergoing several treatments and are happy with the results on their skin, which made them appreciate the treatments and products and wanted to spread the word. But I wouldn't ask for it, there's no way I'll ask someone to share a post on social media about me.' Did you write to her afterwards? 'I wrote her 'Oh my God, I can't believe it, thank you!' I don't really know how to speak English, I took a course and it wasn't helpful. But I didn't let this obstacle stop me. She replied, 'You deserve it'.' How did you get to her in the first place? 'Her personal assistant wrote to me. It is very common In L.A. to provide facial treatment at the client's house, because they usually have the bed and some of them also have the devices. I bring my products, so there's no problem. These are people who really have everything. My heart was palpitating before I got there, but as soon as I entered Kim's house, I acted very professionally. There is no room for mistakes, and even if I am excited, I say it out loud, to break the ice. Kim is very, very beautiful, kind, agreeable, very simple, behaving like an ordinary, regular person.' So she has blackheads on her nose? 'She's perfect. There's a reason why these women become stars, they have a halo above their head.' Didn't you pay her to share the story on Instagram? 'If I had two million dollars I would probably be in Thailand now. I can't explain how it happened. I still don't believe it. These people are unable to be reached, and I literally touch them. What are the chances it would happen to Keren from the southern city of Be'er Sheva?' At Paris Hilton's party But it did happen. The 46-year-old Bartov, married and a mother of three, is currently the woman who treats the faces of the most famous women in the world, including: Julia Roberts, Demi Moore, Jennifer Lopez, Kate Moss, Selena Gomez, Cindy Crawford, Lily Collins, Paris Hilton, Goldie Hawn, Kirsten Dunst and also Gal Gadot, one of her long-time clients from Israel. Bartov started off more than a decade ago, in a small clinic located in a small town in Israel, with Gal Gadot being a loyal client. Over the years she's amassed an impressive clientele which led her to open a larger clinic in Tel Aviv, containing six treatment rooms where she works in parallel with her team of trained Aestheticians. After an hour of using various different machines to target the skin issues, the customers leave with a glowing skin that is ready for a close-up. A year and a half ago, Bartov launched a clinic in Notting Hill London. And just like in the movie, Julia Roberts walked in. Bartov doesn't get confused. 'I don't mind who walks inside, it can be a celebrity, a doctor, a lawyer. It doesn't matter. I have to give my best and not be distracted. And no, I don't let it affect me while I'm treating.' How do you break the ice in such encounters? 'I say, 'I'm very glad you're here'. Frankly, it's everyone's dream to meet with these people, so I say the first thing that comes to mind.' 'I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her'. 'No way! It would make me sound like a groupie.' But it's very natural. You meet them in quite an intimate situation, without makeup, standing really close to them. Is there no embarrassment involved? 'No, because I know how to get over the embarrassment. There is excitement, certainly at the beginning; I felt it when I started treating celebrities in Israel. My first renowned clients were Hila Nachshon and Shiri Maimon, and my hands were shaking. I saw Shiri parking her car and I took deep breaths, but when she entered the room I played it cool, although deep inside I felt breathless. I admired her.' Do these treatments lead to friendship? 'In Israel, obviously, but also abroad, because the treatments are very intimate, we maintain very private conversations despite my poor English. So yes, it connects. I also have friends there who would invite me to their events; I've just been to Paris Hilton's party, for example. They can come to me after having a really bad day, just waiting for someone to pour their heart out to, and they confide in me. They know I'm there for them, so they share; we enter each other's hearts.' Do these A-lists pay? 'They all pay.' Did Kim pay? 'Yes she did.' Did Julia Roberts take out her credit card? 'Yes. With a card having the name 'Julia Roberts' imprinted on it.' So there is no 'give and take'? 'No. They receive treatment. They would tell me, 'I have never experienced such a treatment'.' It's a real compliment. 'I admit that I don't get it. They've tried everything, and eventually, I, Keren from Israel, gave them the best treatment? It's inconceivable. But I know that I'm working very hard, and I'm always looking for the next thing, the next machine; both in Israel and in London, somehow I'm always the first to bring the most advanced machines, and then it starts to spread and becomes common. In the end, the greatest satisfaction is not treating this or that A-list, but it's rather helping people with skin problems, regardless of who they are.' And as a very successful Israeli, working abroad at a time when not everyone likes to disclose their connection to Israel or to Israelis, do you feel that you need to hide your Israeli identity? 'Absolutely not. I'm not hiding. I upload stories on social media about the situation, about the hostages, about the war. I am so proud of my country, I will never conceal my identity.' Were there any consequences involved in this decision? 'Some wrote to me, 'You are murderers,' 'We will confiscate your land.' There were also clients who left, but there were also non-Jews clients who came to me specifically to express their support, saying that they wanted to book a treatment to support an Israeli business. They see reality as it is.' Were there demonstrations in front of your clinic in London? 'No, but I'm afraid, it's unpleasant. However, I'm not going to hide my being Israeli. Even if I wanted to, my non-native English accent would give me away. They know that I'm Keren from the bloc.' To what extent being around these world's influential women requires you to engage in Hasbara (advocacy)? 'To a great extent; I'm not afraid to express my opinion, even though their opinion is different than mine. I was able to exert my influence on some women, but I can't influence them all.' How much do these Hollywood stars ask about the situation? 'A lot. I won't share names because what is said in the room stays in the room, but a lot of them are very much interested. I won't treat stars who are purely pro-Palestinian; this will never happen. You can't come to me for treatment while deep inside you want to exterminate me. I will be more than happy to treat girls who hold a more complex opinion. For example, there are clients who post stories about the children in Gaza. I can understand that; they don't live in Israel, they don't understand what's going on; what else, the media abroad doesn't always cover Israeli news. So I feel it's a big mission to show our side of the story as well. Very often I show them video clips of the October 7 massacre, saying, 'You don't get it, we didn't start the war'.' So you apply active ingredients while providing Hasbara. 'Yes, I'm happy to do it and I also know how to do it, without pressuring. If I see that someone feels uncomfortable and things get awkward, then I build the relationship step by step, and maybe on the next or the third treatment we could talk about it. There were girls who deleted an Instagram story featuring 'Free Palestine' because of me. I wrote to them at length, despite my poor English, and they took down their Instagram story to respect me.' What does it do to you, shifting from the Israeli reality to this glamorous life? 'It makes me jealous. I keep asking myself, 'how come all they can think of is which restaurant to go to and which dress to wear, and all we do is suffer?' And it strikes me every time I'm abroad, seeing the luxury, the restaurants, their evenings out, the evening gowns and the bags; I would say 'how lucky they are to engage in all these insignificant things, they are so fortunate. Why only we have to endure sadness?' I think about it every day. They don't understand us, and will never do, unless they live in Israel; therefore we cannot judge them. They don't understand because they see only one side of the picture.' Spending one week every month in London She was born in the northern city of Be'er Sheva, a middle child of three sisters. She knew what the meaning of freelance was since she was a child. 'My parents owned clothing stores in Be'er Sheva and Arad (in the south), and they kept warning me, 'don't ever be a freelancer, it's tough'. To this day my parents work very hard. They still own a clothing store in central Israel. I kept saying to myself that I wouldn't work as freelancer, because I've seen its ups and downs and the risks it involved. But somehow it happened.' Just before it happened, Bartov tried her luck as an play-actress. 'My biggest dream was to become an actress. I studied acting for three years at Beit Zvi School of the Performing Arts. When I graduated, I went to an audition, where I saw hundreds of girls more beautiful and successful than I was, and I said, 'Bye Keren, go home, this is not for you'. I was very insecure at the time. When you finish acting school you feel worn out, because you always have to deal with harsh and critical reviews. I'm really proud of myself for not going nuts there.' 'So when acting didn't work out for me I went to engage in my second favorite thing: cosmetics. I've loved it from the day I was born. When I was in second grade I would steal creams from my mother and sell them to neighbors; poor thing, every week she would fire another housekeeper.' At the age of 28, she met Roy, then an army man and now a businessman, and the two moved into a small house in the south, which included two rooms she would use for facial treatment. Her three children, who are now 16, 15 and 11 years old, were born there. 'For two years I kept it secret,' she recalls. I remember my mother asking me not to disclose that I engaged in cosmetics. Why? 'Because back then it was considered a profession for people who failed in school, although it wasn't true, as there were well-educated girls who took cosmetics with me. It's an amazing profession, which is highly valued today. For me, cosmetics is like medicine. In order to become a professional facialist you have to learn about the skin like a doctor. After all, a facialist does much more than removing blackheads.' At the age of 29, when she felt she was engaging in a profession that was right for her, Bartov managed to rise to success. 'Within two months, my schedule was fully booked. My advertisement has been word-of-mouth. After spending eight years in the south, we moved to the city of Kadima, located in the center of Israel, to fulfil my dream, treating the local mega-star Shiri Maimon. You didn't know each other. 'No. Her aunt came for treatment, and at her recommendation, Shiri also came.' Among her first customers in Kadima there was also one, Gal Gadot. 'She is one of a kind, a client who turned into a friend. During the COVID period I decided to fulfill my life-long dream to set up a clinic overseas, and I had already started the procedure with Los Angeles - regulations, getting approvals for products, etc. One day Gal came for treatment in Tel Aviv. I told her that I was planning to go to L.A., and she advised me to try London instead; it's the center of the world, it's a four-hour flight from Israel, and the procedure to set up a business there is easier. I went home, asking my husband to halt the procedure with L.A. which started six months earlier. I took Gal's advice, and thanks to her I opened the London clinic.' It's a courageous step. 'Yes, and it requires taking loans as well, but life is short and I think that we, women, need to fulfill ourselves. There were people who had doubts, my father, for example, told me 'Don't do that, I won't let you risk everything you've built so far'. But I told him 'You'll see that I'll make it, nothing can stop me.' After a year I started receiving requests from my famous clients in London to come and take care of them ahead of the Golden Globe Awards. I informed Gal that I was coming, and she told me without hesitating, 'Give me the dates. I'm texting my friends, they must know you'.' She texted her mega-star friends, and that's how Isla Fisher, Natalie Portman and Kristen Wiig became her clients. I see changes in the skin of Israeli women this past year. They suffer from sudden acne outbreaks or spots. Stress and sadness negatively affect the skin, and this year we definitely see an increase in skin problems. So what does your schedule look like today? 'I have a team of highly trained aestheticians in London that take care of them all. I spend one week every month at the clinic in London, and before every award ceremony I fly to take care of my client actresses. I've just been there, for the Emmy Awards. The rest of the time I'm at the clinic in Tel Aviv, and even when I'm not there I know what's going on in every single treatment room.' Do you plan to open a clinic in Los Angeles? 'Sure. And it will happen soon.' Does your career affect your personal life? 'Sure. When I worked in Kadima, the children knew that I finished work at 2 p.m. to prepare their lunch. It's funny, the first treatment I gave to Gal Gadot was at noon, and I invited her to eat schnitzels with us. When I started the clinic in Tel Aviv, I was no longer at home by 2, but still, I waited for my children to grow up a bit so I could also fulfill myself. But I always struggle with feelings of guilt. I went from being a totally devoted mom to a mom who disappears for a week once a month, or for two weeks when I'm in Los Angeles. I used to be a mother who never flew without the children, I never used the services of a babysitter.' Do you get comments from your children? 'Many times they are upset when I travel, asking 'why are you going again?' I reply that 'mom is going to fulfill her dream, and when you grow up you will also want to fulfill your dreams'. So, on the one hand they are very proud of me, but on the other hand, they miss me. But my husband helps and is very supportive of me.' Does he allow you to take out blackheads from his face? After all, this is what we like to do, even though we are not facialists. 'He won't let me. It is painful!' Didn't your husband undergo treatment by Keren Bartov?! 'No. Neither have my sisters. I don't have time, they get treatment from my staff from time to time.' Let's face it, it's not cheap. Not the facial treatment, nor the products. 'It's all relative. A facial cream or acid is priced at $100-150, and because my ingredients are highly concentrated, all you need is apply one drop. I know that when you see the price you say, 'It's expensive,' but you should take into consideration that you use the product for five to six months. You don't need to cover yourself with cream to see results.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Do you see changes in the skin of Israeli women this past year? 'Yes, of course. They suffer from sudden acne outbreaks or spots. Stress and sadness negatively affect the skin, and this year we definitely see an increase in skin problems. We take care of families of hostages and hostages who have returned from captivity. It's heartbreaking. You understand that after all that we've been through, everything is just nonsense.' Now that you're working also overseas, does the thought of leaving Israel pass through your mind? 'No way. I have three sons, my eldest loves the army. Now it's our time to contribute our share to the country. I am extremely worried, but there's nothing I can do. He wants to have a military career like his father. There is no way I will leave. In the end, Israel is my country, this is where my family lives. I love being here. There's no place like home.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/skircq1mye	2024-12-07T02:15:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/02/11/S1YmcLLjT/S1YmcLLjT_526_7_1875_1056_0_small.jpg

Amid hostile academic environments, Israeli firms to safeguard US...	Trump’s election spurred US and Canadian universities to enlist Israeli-linked security firms to manage pro-Palestinian campus protests, igniting fierce debates over safety measures, political tensions, and the growing influence of Israel’s security expertise in North America When Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, he vowed to penalize academic institutions that failed to curb 'rampaging lunatics and Hamas supporters.' In the wake of this declaration, a growing number of universities across the U.S. and Canada have turned to Israeli security firms—or companies with ties to Israel—to handle the surge of pro-Palestinian protests on their campuses. One of the most prominent examples is the City University of New York (CUNY), which has recently become a focal point for such protests. In response to escalating tensions, the university approved a $4 million security contract with *Strategic Security Corp.*, a company owned by Joseph Sordi, a former NYPD officer and Mossad alumnus. Sordi has proudly touted his professional training in Israel, and the company’s website highlights that its security managers undergo 'formal training' in Israel. In a public statement, Strategic Security Corp. described the campus climate as being overrun by 'a surge of pro-Palestinian protesters infiltrated by seasoned propagandists who employ guerrilla warfare tactics of non-permissive asymmetrical resistance, actively opposing, inciting crowds, and sparking violence and chaos.' The company assured that it would leverage its 'capabilities and expertise to identify and monitor threats, deploy effectively, and maintain a robust, manned security force.' CUNY defended its decision by citing the 'unsafe and hostile' conditions within pro-Palestinian protest camps, which reached a boiling point last April when clashes with the NYPD led to mass pepper spraying. Over 170 people were arrested, and several students suffered injuries, ranging from broken bones to lost teeth, requiring medical intervention. Similar tensions erupted in Montreal, where students rallied in the streets chanting 'globalize the intifada' in protest against Concordia University’s decision to hire two Israeli security firms. The companies, Perceptage International and Moshav Security Consultants, are both run by Israeli Defense Forces veterans. Perceptage International is headed by Adam Cohen, a former chief security officer of the Jerusalem District Court, while Moshav Security Consultants is managed by Eyal Feldman, an IDF reserve commander and former special advisor to Israel’s Ministry of Defense. Meanwhile, UCLA saw its own share of controversy last May when violent clashes broke out on campus. Protesters alleged that security guards from the Israeli firm Magen Am, staffed with individuals with military backgrounds, acted aggressively toward them. UCLA later admitted that the company had been hired to assist with policing the protests and had worked in coordination with local law enforcement, receiving $1 million in city funds for its services. Additionally, the American security firm Contemporary Services Corporation—which operates an exclusive branch in Israel—was also contracted to manage campus security and address protest hotspots across Los Angeles. The involvement of Israeli-linked security firms has highlighted the U.S.’s growing reliance on Israel’s expertise in the private security sector. Many of these companies employ former members of Israel’s security establishment, including veterans of intelligence units, IDF, and Shin Bet. Their extensive operational experience in Israel is often seen as a valuable asset for universities seeking swift solutions to rising campus unrest. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: However, reliance on Israeli expertise has not gone without criticism. Protesters and student organizations argue that the presence of firms with Israeli security backgrounds exacerbates existing political tensions. At Concordia, for instance, outraged students claimed that hiring Israeli-linked security firms 'adds fuel to the fire' and erodes trust within the academic community. They issued demands for the university to immediately terminate its contracts with these companies and divest from any direct or indirect financial ties to Israel. Concordia, however, defended its decision, stating that the hiring of these firms was purely motivated by the need to ensure campus safety in light of potentially escalating protests, insisting that it had no connection to Israel. This unfolding situation paints a complex picture of how universities are grappling with growing unrest, while also drawing scrutiny for the methods and partnerships they choose to maintain order. As protests intensify, the debate over the role of Israeli security firms in North America is unlikely to subside anytime soon. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjdnsdwvyl	2024-12-06T21:42:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/05/01/rJcis9JfC/rJcis9JfC_0_0_3000_2001_0_small.jpg

StopAntisemitism urges U.S. to cut ties with IDS CEO Patrick Doyl...	The U.S. government should have zero tolerance for antisemitism,' StopAntisemitism wrote on X The privately funded American advocacy group StopAntisemitism has called on the U.S. government to sever ties with Patrick Doyle, founder and chief executive of International Diplomatic Supplies (IDS). Doyle, whose company supplies alcohol to U.S. embassies worldwide, has been accused of openly expressing antisemitic views. According to posts archived and shared by StopAntisemitism on X (formerly Twitter), Doyle has spread conspiracy theories about Zionists controlling the media and banks, called for boycotting 'every Israeli product and Israeli-owned business,' and accused the IDF of being 'white supremacists.' 'The U.S. government should have zero tolerance for antisemitism,' StopAntisemitism wrote on X. 'It’s time to end contracts with individuals like Patrick Doyle and ensure our values are reflected in our business dealings.' One example cited by StopAntisemitism is a LinkedIn post from eight months ago, in which Doyle wrote: 'Why why why? Are all Western leaders owned by 🇮🇱 money? What other reason? Do they want a white supremacist military in the Middle East? How can the leaders of the West watch the genocide in Gaza and continue to back the Zionists?' In another post from January 17 that he shared on Facebook, Doyle wrote: 'I’ve got to share this. 🇮🇱 is an evil, genocidal abomination.' Doyle’s business background has been previously highlighted in a 2022 article by The Moodie Davitt Report. The article described how he founded IDS in 1997 from his London bedroom, initially serving a small number of British embassies. Over time, IDS expanded into an international network headquartered in Dubai, with operations across the Middle East, UK, Europe, and North America. The piece also portrayed Doyle as someone driven to address 'needy situations.' 'I just want to help other people,' Doyle said in the article. 'IDS has given me a platform where I can see these situations because I travel the world. And we have the funds that allow the company to commit to go and do something.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkqtts1141l	2024-12-06T19:12:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/07/Skyf5SbEkg/Skyf5SbEkg_0_0_824_457_0_small.jpg
Are Israel's wars over?	According to Eric Mandel, founder and director of MEPIN, 'these wars will not be over' for a long time While President-elect Donald Trump’s nominated U.S. advisor on the Middle East, Lebanese American businessman Massad Boulos, has claimed that Israel’s wars are over, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly disagrees. So, which is it? According to Eric Mandel, founder and director of MEPIN, 'these wars will not be over' for a long time. 'We will hopefully have good ceasefires, and that's the best you can expect at this point in time,' he told ILTV News. Mandel explained that Gaza and Lebanon present entirely different challenges. 'Lebanon is a real nation, but a totally failed state. Even though Hezbollah has been tremendously weakened, they are still basically in control there. Gaza, on the other hand, is something that's self-contained.' The problem, he said, is the lack of a clear 'day after' plan for Gaza. 'Netanyahu does not want any Palestinian Authority involvement,' Mandel said. 'That is a big problem. I am not saying that the PA should be there, but you need to have something there. And if Hamas is not totally destroyed as a military and governing entity, no other nation would want to put their soldiers in harm’s way—not the Emiratis, Germans, or Saudis.' He emphasized the urgent need for a strategy for Gaza's future. 'I think they really need to get to some kind of ‘day after’ plan in Gaza,' Mandel added. Mandel also expressed concern about the potential implications of a hostage deal if Hamas remains in power. He warned that the Trump administration might pressure Israel to avoid taking necessary security actions in Gaza, similar to Israel’s interventions in Area A of Judea and Samaria.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1x2bswvjl	2024-12-06T18:50:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/06/SkANeFgVJx/SkANeFgVJx_0_94_1601_901_0_small.jpg
Israeli hostage’s niece calls for action: ‘Hugs and sympathy are ...	Efrat Machikawa: 'I believe that at the end of the day, the right thing will be done' The niece of Israeli hostage Gadi Moses says she is optimistic that a recent Egyptian hostage deal proposal could succeed in bringing her uncle home. 'Although we had all these disappointments, I have to say that every time I hear a tiny little bit of a chance, I’m optimistic because I know this is the right thing to do,' Efrat Machikawa told ILTV News. 'I believe that at the end of the day, the right thing will be done, and they [the hostages] will be back' in Israel. Machikawa admitted that the hostage families are 'tired' and 'disappointed,' but she said her emotions pale in comparison to what her 80-year-old uncle must be enduring. 'We’re strong enough to wait for them here and to be ready to hug them, to support them, to have their rehabilitation start,' she said. Moses was kidnapped from his home in Kfar Aza on October 7, along with his partner, her daughter, and her two granddaughters. The women have since been released. However, Moses remains in captivity. On December 19 last year, Hamas released a video of Moses. In the video, Machikawa said he already seemed weak. 'But I hope that the people who are holding him do see how special he is, how wonderful he is to the world, and maybe that will hold him strong enough to come back. We miss him daily.' She called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring the hostages home, expressing gratitude for the statements made last week by former US President Donald Trump that Hamas will have 'hell to pay' if the hostages are not returned by the time he takes office on January 20. 'It is upon our government to make sure they do the right thing, to release them and bring them home, because hugs and sympathy are not enough,' Machikawa said. 'We need them physically with us at home. They are the citizens of this state. They belong here.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk7kesb4je	2024-12-06T18:32:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/20/S1sTAQevp/S1sTAQevp_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

I was there to document the war': IDF combat photographer learns...	David Revayev, who accompanied IDF forces on the field and lost his leg in Gaza, recalls injury and rehabilitation and says the camera will never leave his side 'This is what I have left of my service,' says David Revayev, 22, holding a Sony camera that accompanied him throughout his military service as a combat photographer for the IDF Spokesperson's Unit. Even when examining it up close, it’s hard to believe this camera was with him when he was severely injured during fighting in Gaza. Aside from a few scratches on the lens, there’s no sign of the anti-tank missile hit that led to his eight-month recovery and the amputation of his right leg. The first time we met David was in February, just two months after his injury. We spoke while he was lying in his room at Sheba Medical Center, recounting stories about Maayan Mulla, the combat engineering officer injured alongside him, the close friends from the combat photography unit who visited his bedside every Friday — even before he regained consciousness — and his camera, waiting for him back at the unit. Back then, he refused to estimate when his recovery would end. 'I still have a long way to go,' he said, Today, we meet again — this time, with a prosthetic leg and his camera in hand. David was born in Uzbekistan and made aliyah to Israel at age four with his mother and brother. He didn’t study photography before enlisting but had a knack for acting in front of the camera. His personal preferences, combined with his combat profile, led him to join the combat photography unit of the IDF Spokesperson's Unit. Over four months, he trained alongside five female and 12 male photographers, completing a combat training course before moving on to a four-month public relations and photography course: 'I discovered the role and fell in love with it.' Between his enlistment in November 2021 and the outbreak of the war, David captured unforgettable moments — from missions beyond Israel’s borders to operations with soldiers in the West Bank. He remembers them all vividly and carefully guards the photographs. Some of them may have even reached wide audiences, as they were published in various media outlets. 'All I could do was hope' Then came the last year of his service — and October 7, 2023. David documented the fighting forces near the Gaza border until the ground operation began. 'We saw horrors there,' he recalls. 'I was impressed by the determined soldiers beside me, constantly on high alert and driven by a clear sense of purpose. It was contagious — it swept me along with them.' 'You don’t process anything at that moment. One moment, you’re running, and the next, you’re trying to get up but can’t. I couldn’t feel my legs at all. My body felt hot. In the midst of gunfire, lying completely exposed in the open, all I could do was hope for the best — that the unit would take care of me and that the terrorist wouldn’t come to finish me off.' On December 12, while on their way to demolish a building, David’s unit was hit by an anti-tank missile. 'You don’t process anything at that moment. One moment, you’re running, and the next, you’re trying to get up but can’t. I couldn’t feel my legs at all. My body felt hot. 'In the midst of gunfire, lying completely exposed in the open, all I could do was hope for the best — that the unit would take care of me and that the terrorist wouldn’t come to finish me off.' In the incident, Staff Sgt. Oriya Yaakov was killed and four other soldiers were injured, including David, who was evacuated in critical condition. 'I forced myself to stay conscious. I knew that the moment I closed my eyes — it would be over. My body only gave out when I reached the hospital.' After three weeks of being sedated and ventilated, during which his right leg was amputated, he woke up. 'I didn’t comprehend anything at first. My parents were the ones who told me about the amputation. Even now, I can still feel the leg and deal with phantom pains — a sense that it’s still there.' 'I didn’t comprehend anything at first. My parents were the ones who told me about the amputation. Even now, I can still feel the leg and deal with phantom pains — a sense that it’s still there.' David's injury was captured on his GoPro camera, which was mounted on his helmet: 'Not every injury is documented like that. It's a powerful visual. Watching the footage gave me certainty — the incident happened exactly as I remembered it; it wasn’t something I imagined.' 'I was there to document war' In May, after months of intensive rehabilitation, David received his custom prosthetic leg — and couldn’t resist taking his first step immediately. 'It never crossed my mind that I’d have to 'learn to walk again,' but it happened. 'It was an incredible moment. This progress is thanks to intensive rehabilitation, physical therapy and occupational therapy. I got up and did whatever was needed to get back to myself every morning.' During this time, David also rekindled an old flame. 'Bar and I had been best friends for eight years. During my recovery, she realized how important I am to her and we became a couple,' he shared. Despite his optimism, he doesn’t shy away from recalling moments of hardship. 'I lost my dominant leg. Realizing I won’t be able to press the pedal as a pianist anymore. Adjusting to driving when I can’t use my right foot to press the pedals. Even just playing soccer with my younger brother requires getting used to kicking with a prosthetic.' After David, the first combat photographer to be injured, four others from the unit sustained light injuries — two in Gaza and another photographer and videographer in Lebanon: 'I hope they’ll be the last,' he said. 'During operations, the camera is stored in a dedicated compartment in the ceramic vest. When I felt my life was at risk, I pulled out my weapon. But ultimately, I was there to document the war. So, if my team was handling the situation and covering me, I took out the camera. That’s the essence of the role.' We met David on the day he traveled to the IDF Spokesperson's Unit to return the camera that had accompanied him throughout his service and injury — barely damaged despite his critical injury. 'During operations, the camera is stored in a dedicated compartment in the ceramic vest. When I felt my life was at risk, I pulled out my weapon. But ultimately, I was there to document the war. So, if my team was handling the situation and covering me, I took out the camera. That’s the essence of the role.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Just before parting with the camera that had survived the chaos alongside him, David bought himself a new Sony camera, which will serve him in the new chapter he’s beginning as a civilian still recovering from his injury. 'There are still a few surgeries ahead. My left foot was completely shattered and prolonged walking still causes pain. After it’s all done, I’ll finally be able to plan my path properly.' In the meantime, he’s traveled to Europe with his partner, promising, 'The camera will continue to be next to me.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/syd11sj11vkl	2024-12-06T12:43:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/05/HyZGHujCXJx/HyZGHujCXJx_0_27_853_481_0_small.jpg

Syrian rebels rally toward Homs, threatening third major city in ...	Anti-Assad forces continue to push against Syrian army while taking control of two critical border crossings; IDF bolsters forces on border; source says Hezbollah aiding regime Ten days ago, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad appeared secure in his rule, having weathered 13 years of civil war in Syria, which in recent years had settled into a low-intensity conflict maintaining a fragile status quo. Everything, however, has shifted dramatically in the past week. Assad has now lost a third city within seven days, along with two critical border crossings. Clashes have also erupted between Druze communities and the Syrian army for the first time. According to reports, three people were killed in the Druze stronghold of Al-Suwayda, where Druze militias seized a police station and the city's central prison, releasing all inmates. This escalation followed protests by hundreds in the main square demanding the fall of Assad's regime. Jihadist rebels launched a surprise offensive on the same day a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah took place. Within a week, they captured Aleppo, took control of Hama on Thursday and are now at the outskirts of Homs — taking three of Syria's four largest cities. Meanwhile, U.S.-backed Kurdish rebels, operating at the same time, seized Deir ez-Zor, Syria's sixth-largest city, severing what was believed to be a critical smuggling route between Iran and Hezbollah. Syrian security sources told Reuters that U.S.-backed Kurdish forces captured Deir ez-Zor in eastern Syria, 450 km (280 miles) from Damascus after the Syrian army and pro-Iranian militias retreated earlier in the day. An Iraqi official said the Kurds are advancing eastward toward Al Bukamal near the Iraqi border, with plans to capture it within 24 hours. Syrian military sources confirmed that the rebels have already taken the nearby border crossing between Syria and Iraq. Meanwhile, the rebel advance in southern Syria continues under the leadership of the jihadist group Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham. They are moving southward and reportedly captured the Nasib border crossing, Syria's only civilian crossing with Jordan, prompting Jordan to close its side of the crossing. Earlier today the IDF reported it was reinforcing its troops in the Golan Heights. Units from several training divisions have been redirected in the past 24 to oversee the border with Syria. The IDF is concerned about potential incidents spiraling out of control, leading to border breaches or infiltration into Israeli communities. Israel's Security Cabinet is set to convene twice to discuss these developments — on Saturday evening and Sunday. The IDF’s reinforcements in the Golan include a recruit battalion comprising two to three companies focused on security patrols. The area will also be bolstered by air support. 'The IDF is monitoring events and preparing for all scenarios, both defensive and offensive,' the military said in a statement. 'We won’t allow threats near Israel's border and will act to neutralize any danger to Israeli citizens.' To counter the rebel advance toward Homs, Hezbollah has reportedly deployed a small team of 'supervisory forces' to assist Assad’s army, according to Lebanese security officials speaking to Reuters. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: A Syrian military source and two regional officials linked to Tehran noted that overnight, Hezbollah’s special forces — possibly from its Radwan Froce — crossed from Lebanon and took positions in Homs.

Iran 'dramatically' increasing enrichment to near bomb grade, IAE...	UN watchdog head reports Tehran's nuclear program enriched uranium to up to 60% purity and adds rate is expected to more than double itself in the near future Iran is 'dramatically' increasing the amount of uranium enriched to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% of weapons-grade, that it is able to produce, the watchdog's chief Rafael Grossi said in an interview. The move is certain to cause even greater alarm in Western capitals already arguing that there is no civilian justification for Iran's enrichment to that level as no other country has done so without producing nuclear bombs, which Iran denies pursuing. Iran already has enough material enriched to up to 60%, its most highly enriched stock, for four nuclear weapons in principle if it enriched it further, according to an IAEA yardstick. It has enough for more at lower enrichment levels. 'Today the agency is announcing that the production capacity is increasing dramatically of the 60% inventory,' International Atomic Energy Agency chief Grossi said on the sidelines of the Manama Dialogue security conference in Bahrain's capital. He added that it was set to rise to 'seven, eight times more, maybe, or even more' than the previous rate of 5-7 kg a month. The escalation comes just a week after European and Iranian officials made little progress in meetings on whether they could engage in serious talks over the disputed nuclear program, before Donald Trump returns to the White House in January. Tehran was angered by a resolution last month put forward by Britain, Germany and France, known as the E3, that criticized Iran for poor cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog. Trump, who after pulling the United States out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers pursued a 'maximum pressure' policy that sought to wreck Iran's economy, is staffing his new administration with noted hawks on Iran. Friday's move is also a setback for Grossi since he said after a trip to Iran in November that Tehran had accepted his 'request' that it caps its stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% to ease diplomatic tensions, calling it 'a concrete step in the right direction'. Diplomats said at the time, however, that Iran's step, which included preparing to implement that cap, was conditional on the IAEA's 35-nation Board of Governors not passing a resolution against Iran over its insufficient cooperation with the agency, which the Board then did regardless. 'We do not have any diplomatic process ongoing which could lead to a de-escalation, or a more stable equation when it comes to Iran,' Grossi said. 'This is regrettable.' The head of France's external intelligence service said last week that Iranian nuclear proliferation was undoubtedly one of the threats, if not the most critical threat in the coming months. The British, German and French foreign ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The E3 have adopted a tougher stance on Iran in recent months, notably since Tehran ramped up its military support to Russia. However, they have always insisted that they wanted to maintain a policy of pressure and dialogue to revive talks well before the 2015 accord ends in October 2025. That deal lifted international sanctions against Iran in return for Tehran accepting some curbs on its nuclear program. Since Trump left the deal, Iran has accelerated its nuclear program while limiting the IAEA's ability to monitor it. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skoqmsxe1l	2024-12-06T07:45:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/06/05/H1K7G4C4C/H1K7G4C4C_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

IDF eliminates Hamas' Aerial Unit commander in Gaza	Military reports Nidal Al-Najar took part in orchestrating aerial infiltration into Israel on October 7 and planning attacks against troop in Gaza The IDF and Shin Bet issued a joint statement on Friday confirming the military has eliminated Nidal Al-Najar, the head of Hamas' Aerial Unit in Gaza City and Aerial Defense Unit in the Strip. 'Al-Najar was one of the masterminds of the aerial infiltration into Israel on October 7. Moreover, throughout the war, Al-Najar was one of the leaders of the attacks against the State of Israel and IDF troops operating in central Gaza, including by means of explosive drone and UAV attacks toward IDF troops,' the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit said in a statement. The IDF’s operation in the Palestinian enclave against Hamas forces continues against the backdrop of a proposed cease-fire and hostage deal agreement offered by Egypt.

Authorities name five Israeli victims in Morocco car crash	Natan Shapira, Shimon Tefilinski, Yosef Tefilinski, Moshe Gallant and Israel Meir Shasha were on their way to a rabbi's tomb when their car lost control and overturned Five Israeli nationals who were a part of the Breslov Hasidic community were killed on Friday in a fatal car accident near the city of Ouarzazate, Morocco. According to the ZAKA Search and Rescue organization, their vehicle lost control and overturned, resulting in the deaths of all passengers. The Foreign Ministry confirmed that its representatives in Rabat, along with the department for Israelis abroad are handling the incident. The victims were identified as Natan Shapira, Shimon Tefilinski, his brother Yosef Tefilinski, Moshe Gallant and Israel Meir Shasha. Their bodies are not expected to be flown back to Israel until Sunday. The group was part of a community led by Ukraine’s Rabbi Yaakov Jan, with a branch in Safed, Israel. Dozens of community members traveled to Morocco to pray at Jewish holy sites. The accident took place while they were en route to the tomb of another rabbi located in a remote desert area. Hours after the group reached their destination, the absence of one vehicle prompted a search involving local police. The victims were eventually found several hours later. Emergency service crews are coordinating to transport the bodies to Casablanca for identification and preparation for burial in Israel. The process involves collaboration between ZAKA, Moroccan authorities and local Jewish communities. 'From the moment we received the report about the tragic incident, we’ve been working through our international unit with Moroccan authorities to expedite the process of releasing and identifying the bodies and to assist the families in every possible way to bring them to burial,' ZAKA Deputy Director-General Chaim Weingarten said. He added that the victims' vehicle had overturned and fallen into a ravine and confirmed that the bodies will be flown from Casablanca to France and then to Israel.

IDF reinforces troops on Golan Heights, strikes Lebanon-Syria bor...	Military concerned over risk that rebel advances in Syria could spread to areas near the border with Israel and put communities there at risk of invasion; strikes on Lebanon-Syria crossings aims to stop arms smuggling that could increase amid fighting The IDF has increased troop deployment along the border with Syria on the Golan Heights as rebel forces continue to advance in their fight against the regime in Damascus. The military's move comes as concerns increase that the fighting in Syria would spread to the areas near the border with Israel and put communities there at risk of invasion. The IDF said earlier on Friday that its forces attacked the Al-Arida and Josiah border crossings between Syria and Lebanon, used according to the military, to smuggle weapons to Hezbollah. Lebanese media reported that both crossings were rendered unusable by the strikes. ' This strike is another aspect in the IDF’s efforts to dismantle weapon-smuggling routes used by the Syrian regime in the Syrian-Lebanese border over the past few weeks. These targeted strikes degrade the capabilities of Hezbollah’s Unit 4400, responsible for smuggling weapons that are later used in terror attacks against Israelis and IDF troops,' the IDF spokesperson's Unit said in a statement. The Al-Arida crossing connects villages in Lebanon to villages by the same name in Syria, in the area of Tartus which is vulnerable to rebel attack as their forces move south and are set to take the strategic city of Homs. The Josiah crossing is near Homs which may fall in the coming hours or days. This is not the first time the IDF has attacked the border crossings between the two countries that are used for the smuggling of arms. The strikes were carried out before the assault on the Assad regime troops which began late last month. After previous attacks repairs were made quickly and the borders were reopened. As the rebels advance on Homs, which is near the Lebanon border, refugees have been attempting to escape the fighting and the chaos in Syria is sure to challenge the IDF's ability to monitor the crossings as terror groups attempt to smuggle weapons and cash under the fog of war.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryhdcue41x	2024-12-06T04:45:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/06/rkB008CwgN1l/rkB008CwgN1l_0_165_1600_901_0_small.jpg

Aleppo’s Christians celebrate Christmas amid changing leadership	After opposition factions take control of Aleppo, the city’s Christian community prepares for the holidays while navigating newfound freedoms and lingering uncertainties After opposition factions take control of Aleppo, the city’s Christian community prepares for the holidays while navigating newfound freedoms and lingering uncertainties Years ago, Ibrahim Hanna Malaki, a Christian legal professional from Aleppo, fled his hometown after being imprisoned for his activism against the Syrian regime. Now living in Switzerland, Malaki reflects on returning to reconnect with family, assess his property, and celebrate the holidays in a city long defined by its Christian heritage. As Syrian opposition factions consolidate control over Aleppo, the city’s Christian community—numbering over 20,000—has begun decorating Christmas trees and preparing for holiday celebrations. Aleppo is home to 30 churches representing 11 Christian denominations, including Syriac Orthodox, Armenian Catholic, and Greek Orthodox communities. In an exclusive interview with The Media Line, Malaki shared that he contacted his relatives in Aleppo after the opposition factions took control, congratulating them on their Christmas preparations. Festivities for Saint Barbara’s Day were held in neighborhoods such as Suleimaniyah, Aziziyeh, and Villa areas, as well as parts of Jaberiyah. Malaki emphasized that Christians in Aleppo have not faced harm from opposition factions, contrasting this with threats previously posed by the Syrian regime. He called on Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the affiliated Salvation Government to ensure peaceful coexistence for all Aleppo residents, allowing Christians and Muslims to freely practice their faith. Syrian journalist Ayman Abdel Nour, based in Washington, confirmed that opposition factions have assured Aleppo’s Christians of their religious freedom. Activist Mohammed Khudair, speaking from Aleppo, corroborated this, noting that Christians conducted prayers last Sunday, just 24 hours after the city fell to the opposition. Khudair noted that Aleppo’s Christians, like the rest of the city’s residents, are engaging in daily activities and shopping in the markets. They are interacting with opposition factions and activists with a sense of growing ease. We are fine and will remain in our city of Aleppo. We will stand by our community through every circumstance, from the harshest to the best. Bishop Ephraim Maalouli met with volunteers from the Diocese Sons group to coordinate support for Aleppo’s Christians during what he described as 'a sensitive period.' Speaking to The Media Line from Aleppo, Bishop Maalouli said, 'We are fine and will remain in our city of Aleppo. We will stand by our community through every circumstance, from the harshest to the best. Prayers continue in our churches.' He confirmed there had been no threats or restrictions on their prayers, except for a recent Russian airstrike on a Christian school in Aleppo. In the Aziziyeh district, Christmas trees now adorn streets, cafes, and balconies, according to activist Abu Sham. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Christian resident Lina shared that she visits the market daily to shop for household needs without harassment but expressed concern that this sense of safety might only be temporary until HTS consolidates its control over the city. Surprisingly, services have improved since the factions took control of Aleppo. We were living under difficult service conditions, but now things are better. In this context, Hanna Saeed, a Christian citizen from Aleppo, told The Media Line that life in Aleppo feels normal. 'Surprisingly, services have improved since the factions took control of Aleppo. We were living under difficult service conditions, but now things are better, especially with the security provided by the factions. They assured us we would not face any harm.' Abu Muhammad al–Julani in Aleppo HTS leader Abu Muhammad al-Julani made his first public appearance in Aleppo on Wednesday, appearing at the city’s citadel among crowds of civilians. The leader of the group, designated as a terrorist organization by the US, announced plans to dissolve the organization and form a transitional council to govern the city. According to affiliated sources, this council will oversee the establishment of new institutions and the reinstatement of employees in Aleppo. With the Syrian regime’s influence waning, some observers see a rare chance for political engagement. Malaki remarked that Christians, who had long been barred from politics, now have an opportunity to help shape Syria’s future. Syrian researcher Mustafa Al-Naemi echoed this sentiment, urging Syrians to collaborate in rebuilding their country. While markets in Aleppo have reopened, high prices reflect the Syrian pound’s collapse. One US dollar now equals 27,000 Syrian pounds in Aleppo, compared to 15,000 in Damascus. Financial experts speculate that the factions may adopt the Turkish lira for stability, as has been done in Idlib and Aleppo’s countryside. There have also been rumors about appointing Bishop Hanna Allouf as Aleppo’s governor. Many Syrians expressed support for the idea, but Allouf denied the claims, telling The Media Line that he does not engage in politics. As discussions and uncertainties continue, Aleppo’s Christians maintain their faith and traditions. They celebrate Christmas, decorate their churches, and continue to pray, even as the city’s leadership and landscape rapidly change around them. Many fled due to Iranian influence and regime crackdowns, but those who remain maintain their traditions, contributing to the city’s diverse social fabric. Christians in Aleppo have lived for centuries as part of the social fabric of the city, and churches have always welcomed Christian children for baptism 'Christians in Aleppo have lived for centuries as part of the social fabric of the city, and churches have always welcomed Christian children for baptism,' Malaki said. 'These rituals remained unchanged even under the control of the Syrian government forces.'

They are interacting with opposition factions and activists with a sense of growing ease. We are fine and will remain in our city of Aleppo. We will stand by our community through every circumstance, from the harshest to the best. Bishop Ephraim Maalouli met with volunteers from the Diocese Sons group to coordinate support for Aleppo’s Christians during what he described as 'a sensitive period.' Speaking to The Media Line from Aleppo, Bishop Maalouli said, 'We are fine and will remain in our city of Aleppo. We will stand by our community through every circumstance, from the harshest to the best. Prayers continue in our churches.' He confirmed there had been no threats or restrictions on their prayers, except for a recent Russian airstrike on a Christian school in Aleppo. In the Aziziyeh district, Christmas trees now adorn streets, cafes, and balconies, according to activist Abu Sham. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Christian resident Lina shared that she visits the market daily to shop for household needs without harassment but expressed concern that this sense of safety might only be temporary until HTS consolidates its control over the city. Surprisingly, services have improved since the factions took control of Aleppo. We were living under difficult service conditions, but now things are better. In this context, Hanna Saeed, a Christian citizen from Aleppo, told The Media Line that life in Aleppo feels normal. 'Surprisingly, services have improved since the factions took control of Aleppo. We were living under difficult service conditions, but now things are better, especially with the security provided by the factions. They assured us we would not face any harm.' Abu Muhammad al–Julani in Aleppo HTS leader Abu Muhammad al-Julani made his first public appearance in Aleppo on Wednesday, appearing at the city’s citadel among crowds of civilians. The leader of the group, designated as a terrorist organization by the US, announced plans to dissolve the organization and form a transitional council to govern the city. According to affiliated sources, this council will oversee the establishment of new institutions and the reinstatement of employees in Aleppo. With the Syrian regime’s influence waning, some observers see a rare chance for political engagement. Malaki remarked that Christians, who had long been barred from politics, now have an opportunity to help shape Syria’s future. Syrian researcher Mustafa Al-Naemi echoed this sentiment, urging Syrians to collaborate in rebuilding their country. While markets in Aleppo have reopened, high prices reflect the Syrian pound’s collapse. One US dollar now equals 27,000 Syrian pounds in Aleppo, compared to 15,000 in Damascus. Financial experts speculate that the factions may adopt the Turkish lira for stability, as has been done in Idlib and Aleppo’s countryside. There have also been rumors about appointing Bishop Hanna Allouf as Aleppo’s governor. Many Syrians expressed support for the idea, but Allouf denied the claims, telling The Media Line that he does not engage in politics. As discussions and uncertainties continue, Aleppo’s Christians maintain their faith and traditions. They celebrate Christmas, decorate their churches, and continue to pray, even as the city’s leadership and landscape rapidly change around them. Many fled due to Iranian influence and regime crackdowns, but those who remain maintain their traditions, contributing to the city’s diverse social fabric. Christians in Aleppo have lived for centuries as part of the social fabric of the city, and churches have always welcomed Christian children for baptism 'Christians in Aleppo have lived for centuries as part of the social fabric of the city, and churches have always welcomed Christian children for baptism,' Malaki said. 'These rituals remained unchanged even under the control of the Syrian government forces.'

5 Israelis killed in fatal crash in Morocco	Fatalities are members of the Breslav Hassidic sect from Safed on a pilgrimage to the graves of Jewish sages; efforts underway to bring bodies to Israel for burial amid challenges of transporting them from the sight of the crash Five Israelis, members of the Breslav Hassidic sect were killed in a car crash near Ouarzazate in Morocco on Friday after the car they were driving spun out of control and turned over. The Foreign Ministry said its representatives in Rabat were dealing with the fatal accident and its aftermath. Sources said the men were part of a section of the sect that has a branch in Safed. Dozens of members of the group were in Morocco to pray at the toms of Jewish sages and other holy sites to Jews. The men were traveling through a desert and only when they did not arrive at a designated meeting spot, others began fearing that something had happened and launched a search with the help of the local police. Hours later the car and its passengers were located. Local authorities were waiting for a vehicle to transport the bodies to Casablanca where they will be identified and flown to Israel. 'We are working with the Moroccan authorities to expedite their transfer to Israel for burial,' Zaka CEO Haim Weingarten said. Safed Mayor Yossi Kakon said the victims of the crash were residents of his city and asked that their identities not be made public until their families could be informed of the tragic event.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk1ywpgnjg	2024-12-06T02:54:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/06/rkuvoUlN1e/rkuvoUlN1e_0_0_1000_563_0_small.jpg

Hayat Tahrir al-Sham leader says his aim is to end Assad regime	Abu Mohammed Al-Golani tells CNN he has distanced himself from jihadists; says all foreign forces including U.S, Russia, Turkey and Iran should leave Syria; tries to calm concerns of danger from Sunni extremists and hopes Syrians displace by civil war, return Abu Mohammed Al-Golani, leader of the rebels in Syria, said in an interview on Friday that his aim is to topple the regime of Bashar al Assad while his troops were advancing on the central Syria city of Homs and were reportedly on the outskirts of the strategically important city. Golani, leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) a former al Qaida affiliate group, told CNN that he intended to rebuild Syria and bring Syrian refugees back from Lebanon and Syria after the escaped the fighting in the decade long civil war. The United States designated the HTS a terror organization and announced a 10 million dollar reward for the capture of Golani The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said thousands of people had begun fleeing from Homs on Thursday night towards the Mediterranean coastal regions of Latakia and Tartus, strongholds of the government. A coastal resident said thousands of people had begun arriving there from Homs, fearing the rebels' rapid advance. Wasim Marouh, a resident of Homs city who decided not to leave, said most of its main commercial streets were empty and only a few grocery shops were open as pro-government militia groups were roaming the streets. Thousands of families had rushed out of the city overnight and traffic jams held up cars for hours, he said.

He tried to ease concerns that his forces pose any danger to non Sunni religious populations and said all ethnic groups had lived in coexistence in Syria for hundreds of years. 'People who fear Islamic governance either have seen incorrect implementations of it or do not understand it properly,' he told CNN in the interview, claiming reports of abuse of civilians by the rebel army were minor incidents that were dealt with and insisting he had severed ties with Jihadist groups. The rebel leader said he hoped to see all foreign forces leave Syria including the Americans, Russians, Turks Iranians and their proxies and that the fall of the Assad regime would facilitate that. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryhcmugekl	2024-12-06T02:25:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/05/HkARcgkEyx/HkARcgkEyx_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in an interview broadcast on Thursday, said the use of a hypersonic missile in the Ukraine war sought to make the West understand that Moscow was ready to use any means to ensure no 'strategic defeat' would be inflicted on Moscow. Russia deployed the Oreshnik hypersonic missile against the Ukrainian city of Dnipro last month in what Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin described as a test of a missile he said could not be brought down. He said Russia could bring other such missiles into action in 'combat conditions' if required. 'The message is that you, I mean the U.S. and the allies of the U.S., who also provide these long-range weapons to the Kyiv regime - they must understand that we would be ready to use any means not to allow them to succeed in what they call a strategic defeat of Russia,' Lavrov told U.S. journalist Tucker Carlson. 'They fight for keeping their hegemony over the world, on any country, any region, any continent. We fight for our legitimate security interests.' Speaking in English, Lavrov said the West had refused to discuss upholding security guarantees for Russia in the weeks and months before the February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, called a 'special military operation' in Moscow.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1gzsxeekl	2024-12-05T22:18:20-08:00

As Syria rebels gain ground, Israel to vows halt Iran’s arms pipe...	Defense officials pledge to prevent Tehran from arming regime, reinforcing troops or rebuilding Hezbollah's military capabilities; Israel reportedly strikes arms depots near Damascus amid fears of unconventional weapons falling into insurgent hands Israeli defense officials vowed Thursday that Iran would not be allowed to arm the Syrian military or reinforce it with troops as Islamist rebels continue to make rapid gains throughout the country. After launching a surprise offensive last week in Idlib province, the rebels have captured Aleppo and breached defenses in Hama, raising fears that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad may increasingly rely on Iran and its proxies for survival. Officials warned that Israel would act to prevent Iran from reestablishing a foothold in Syria, which could offer Hezbollah a vital military lifeline after suffering heavy losses in its war against Israel. They also noted that they have observed a surge in Iranian efforts to rearm Hezbollah in Lebanon. Concerns are growing globally over the potential for rebel forces to seize Syria's unconventional weapons stockpiles. According to Saudi outlet Al Hadath, Israel bombed weapons storage facilities north of Damascus overnight, reportedly targeting chemical weapons to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently cautioned Assad against collaborating with Iran and Hezbollah, warning he was 'playing with fire.' Following the rebel offensive, Netanyahu reiterated that Israel is closely monitoring developments and would act to protect its interests. The Security Cabinet is meeting on Thursday to discuss the situation in Syria, among other matters, following an early morning security assessment by Defense Minister Israel Katz and IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi. Israeli officials noted Russia's reduced military presence in Syria due to its war in Ukraine, leaving Assad without the same level of support as during the Syrian civil war. Previously, Russia, alongside Iranian fighters and militias, played a pivotal role in stabilizing Assad's regime, enabling him to regain most of the country and confine insurgents to the northwestern Idlib province. In recent years, the fighting had slowed considerably. The rebel offensive coincided with last week’s Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire, exploiting the weakened Lebanese-based Iranian proxy and pro-Iran militias to advance. Assad's forces retreated, allowing Sunni jihadist fighters led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former al-Qaeda affiliate, to seize Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Despite Russian airstrikes, the rebels continued their advances. Damascus has not confirmed the fall of Hama, though Assad's troops have withdrawn, claiming to 'redeploy on the outskirts to avoid urban warfare and protect civilians.' The loss of Hama would be a significant blow, potentially isolating the regime's coastal strongholds in Tartus and Latakia. Latakia, home to Assad's Alawite sect and a Russian naval base, is strategically and symbolically critical to the regime's survival. Hama’s location on the route between Aleppo and Damascus also opens the way for rebel forces to advance on Homs. The rebels announced their intent to move on the city, urging its population to rise against the government. 'Your time has come,' they declared on social media. The Al Arabiya network reported airstrikes, likely by the Syrian air force, targeting a strategic bridge near Homs to slow the rebels’ advance.

Cyprus acquires advanced Israeli air defense system in shift away...	Island nation replaces outdated Russian air defenses with Israel's Barak MX system, capable of intercepting drones and cruise missiles up to 150 km; local media calls acquisition 'game-changer' amid threats from Turkey; Ankara yet to respond Cyprus has purchased Israel’s Barak MX air defense system, capable of intercepting threats up to 150 kilometers (95 miles) away, Cypriot media reported on Thursday. Initial deliveries of the system have reportedly arrived in recent days, with at least one battery deployed and operational. The Barak MX, produced by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), is designed for land and sea use. It includes various interceptors capable of targeting aircraft, helicopters, drones, anti-ship missiles, cruise missiles and certain ballistic missiles within ranges of 2 to 150 kilometers. The Israeli Navy also uses the system under the name 'Barak Magen.' Cypriot media described the system as one of the most advanced in the region, drawing comparisons to Israel’s renowned Iron Dome. The Kathimerini newspaper called the system a 'game-changer,' stating it significantly enhances Cyprus’ defensive capabilities and could enable the enforcement of a no-fly zone over its airspace if necessary. Discussions for the purchase reportedly began in 2021, reflecting growing defense cooperation between Israel and Cyprus. This cooperation includes joint air force drills, often held in Cypriot and Greek airspace due to their Russian-made air defense systems. The obsolescence of these Russian systems, including the Tor M1 currently in use by Cyprus, prompted the island nation to upgrade its air defense infrastructure. A senior Cypriot official told Reuters that EU sanctions on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 have caused a shortage of spare parts for Cyprus’ Russian systems. 'That is why Cyprus is turning to other countries of the European Union, as well as Israel. As part of that, efforts are underway to upgrade our anti-aircraft umbrella,' the official said. Initially, the Barak MX system will complement existing Russian systems but is expected to replace them in the long term. Greece, too, is reportedly in talks with Israel to acquire air defense systems, including David’s Sling and SPYDER. The acquisition comes against the backdrop of the island nation's decades-long tensions with Turkey. The island has been divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded the north following a Greece-backed coup. The northern part operates as the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognized only by Turkey, while the southern part is an EU member state and the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides hinted at the Turkish threat when asked about the purchase. While not confirming the deal outright, he said, 'What I can say is that we are doing everything necessary to strengthen Cyprus’ deterrence capabilities—not only because we are a nation under occupation, but as an EU member state in a region of unique geopolitical importance.' The president’s cautious remarks likely reflect sensitivity over relations with Turkey. In 1998, Greece-backed Cyprus faced sharp Turkish opposition after acquiring Russian S-300 missiles, forcing their relocation to Crete to avoid military escalation. For now, Cypriot media reports that Turkey has remained silent regarding the Israeli system’s acquisition. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjlgtoje1e	2024-12-05T10:34:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/05/HybIsbwkEkx/HybIsbwkEkx_0_0_825_465_0_small.jpg

US rejects Amnesty International report accusing Israel of genoci...	State Department dismisses genocide allegations as 'unfounded,' emphasizing that the best path to improving humanitarian conditions in Gaza is 'for the parties to work toward an agreement to stop the war' U.S. State Department on Thursday dismissed claims raised in an Amnesty International report alleging that Israel is committing genocide in the Gaza Strip. 'We disagree with the conclusions of such a report,' State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel told a press briefing. 'We have said previously and continue to find the allegations of genocide are unfounded.' Patel acknowledged the importance of international organizations in monitoring the situation in Gaza but emphasized that the U.S. does not share Amnesty’s interpretation. 'That does not change the continued concern we have as it relates to the humanitarian situation in Gaza,' he added. 'The best thing that can happen, if we want to see improvement in the humanitarian conditions in Gaza... is for the parties to work toward an agreement to stop the war.' In its report, entitled 'You Feel Like You Are Subhuman,' the human rights group alleges that Israel’s actions constitute a violation of the Genocide Convention, claiming intentional destruction of Gaza’s Palestinian population. The report accuses Israel of systematically treating Palestinians as subhuman, with deliberate acts of killing, causing serious bodily or mental harm and deliberately inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction in whole or in part. It highlights allegations of starvation, forced displacement, relentless bombings and prevention of humanitarian aid. Amnesty’s investigation claims Israel displaced 1.9 million people in Gaza over the past year, with some individuals uprooted up to 10 times. The report further alleges that 42,000 Gazans, including 13,300 children, have been killed, with 97,000 injured, in what it describes as an unprecedented scale of destruction in the 21st century. The report claims Israeli bombardments 'often wip[ed] out entire multigenerational families' and made large swaths of Gaza 'uninhabitable.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Amnesty accuses Israel of using 'intentional starvation' to expose Gazans to 'slow and calculated death,' rejecting Israel’s claims that Hamas uses civilians as human shields. The organization also contends that the destruction of Gaza’s population, even under the guise of targeting Hamas, demonstrates genocidal intent. The IDF rejected the findings of the report, which includes interviews with 212 witnesses and victims' families, alongside data from Palestinian authorities. 'The allegations presented in the report are entirely baseless and disregard the operational realities the IDF faces. Since Hamas's unprecedented attack on October 7, 2023, the IDF has been working to dismantle Hamas's terror infrastructure while adhering to its obligations under international law. The IDF takes every possible measure to minimize harm to civilians during its operations. These steps include evacuation warnings for civilians in combat zones and ensuring safe passage to designated areas,' the military said in a statement. 'The IDF’s efforts, led by the Civilian Harm Mitigation Unit, involve issuing early warnings, assisting civilians who heed these warnings in relocating, and ensuring their welfare after reaching safe areas. These efforts are substantial. Additionally, the IDF has been implementing lessons learned during the war to continuously improve existing processes. The accusations in the report of genocide and intentional harm are unfounded and ignore Hamas’s violations of international law, including its use of civilians as human shields and deliberate targeting of Israeli civilians. The IDF remains committed to conducting its operations in accordance with international law.' The Israeli chapter of Amnesty has also expressed sharp disagreement with the international organization’s conclusions, highlighting internal tensions. In a separate note, Amnesty International called for the unconditional release of hostages held by Hamas and accountability for those responsible for the October 7 attacks. The organization said those events would be the focus of a forthcoming report. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjvqmuynjx	2024-12-05T10:09:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/03/S111QMLz27Jg/S111QMLz27Jg_0_43_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
US rejects Amnesty report accusing Israel of genocide	U.S. State Department on Thursday dismissed claims raised in an Amnesty International report alleging that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. 'We disagree with the conclusions of such a report,' spokesperson Vedant Patel told a press briefing. 'We have said previously and continue to find the allegations of genocide are unfounded.' Patel acknowledged the importance of international organizations in monitoring the situation in Gaza but emphasized that the U.S. does not share Amnesty’s interpretation. 'That does not change the continued concern we have as it relates to the humanitarian situation in Gaza, he added. 'The best thing that can happen, if we want to see improvement in the humanitarian conditions in Gaza... is for the parties to work toward an agreement to stop the war.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ptx001vyl	2024-12-05T09:35:47-08:00

IDF ground forces reflect on a year of combat and prepare for the...	Senior IDF officials plan for a multi-front war, focusing on more combat engineering battalions, stronger border defenses and drones to reduce Air Force reliance; tunnel threats, both new and re-excavated, remain key challenge The IDF Ground Forces Command on Thursday reviewed its operations in Gaza and northern Israel, preparing for continued combat against Hamas in the coming years, regardless of potential hostage deals. The briefing highlighted challenges and lessons learned from the fighting in Gaza, which marked the military’s first large-scale maneuver in 17 years. Military officials acknowledged that in the two weeks following Hamas’ October 7 attacks, there was significant internal opposition to the idea of a ground invasion. 'For every supporter of the maneuver, there was an opponent,' said an IDF source. 'But those familiar with the ground forces were not surprised by the success of the soldiers and their capabilities.' The officials noted that initial operations were slower as forces adapted to the terrain and tactics. 'We had to learn the area, the enemy and the pathways to what is now a defeated terrorist organization, stripped of its primary capabilities, including launching rockets,' they said. The IDF emphasized that units, such as the 252nd Division, had not conducted maneuvers of this scale since the First Lebanon War. The early stages of the Gaza campaign were marked by difficulties in locating and neutralizing terrorists hiding in buildings. 'At first, we thought we’d simply seal tunnel shafts and move forward. Today, our forces are maneuvering within the tunnels,' an official said. However, the IDF and the Israeli government have yet to achieve the war's declared objectives: returning hostages held by Hamas and dismantling the terrorist group’s military and governing capabilities. 'The IDF is capable of dismantling Hamas militarily, but the army cannot establish an alternative government,' a military official said. The Ground Forces Command identified combat engineering battalions as a critical need after more than a year of prolonged warfare. A new regular battalion is already being established, and the elite Yahalom engineering unit, which has tripled in size since Operation Protective Edge in 2014, is set to expand further. The military also awaits the arrival of 132 D9 bulldozers purchased from the United States. Their delivery has been delayed due to an informal arms embargo imposed by the Biden administration. Territorial and tactical air defense: The new battalions Throughout the months of fighting, the Ground Forces Command managed to add no fewer than 100 new engineering vehicles to its arsenal, sourced primarily from civilian companies and local purchases. The command also plans to bolster its forces by establishing new territorial defense battalions as part of the military’s lessons learned from the October 7 attacks, aimed at strengthening border security. Additionally, the IDF intends to form a tactical air defense battalion to protect maneuvering forces from threats like drones and UAVs, operating within brigade-level frameworks without reliance on the Air Force. 'The Ground Forces must reduce dependence on the Air Force, allowing it to focus its resources on strikes and operations in third-ring countries like Iran and Yemen. This means bringing more firepower and equipment to soldiers on the ground,' IDF officials said. The military also plans to upgrade two brigades, likely from the reserves, into armored brigades equipped with Namer APCs. 'Some armored brigades were not prepared for war because that’s how we trained them,' officials admitted. 'We’ve closed gaps, but there’s still a lot of work ahead.' Despite challenges, the Ground Forces Command expressed satisfaction with the fighting spirit of the troops, particularly among reservists who continue to rise to the mission under significant strain. 'At the start of the war, we studied foreign armies where morale dropped after 33 days of fighting, requiring troops to be rotated out. That hasn’t happened here—in fact, the opposite is true,' officials noted. The command also acknowledged gaps and weaknesses yet to be resolved: Partial network communication between command centers and field HQs; operational continuity failures on October 7, when Gaza Division command centers were disabled for hours; insufficient firepower for ground troops, forcing them to rely on aerial support; outdated operational mobility, relying on aging Hummers, converted trucks and a limited number of APCs deemed inadequate for the mission. Officials admitted the pace of acquiring new equipment remains slow. However, there was a significant personnel development: the upcoming recruitment of the first female soldiers to the paratrooper mobility unit, part of the military's effort to integrate more women into combat roles. Iranian missiles and tunnels: The next war As part of their analysis of the war, senior IDF officials are already outlining the anticipated patterns of the next war. They foresee a multi-front 'strategic spread' against Israel, featuring enhanced coordination between Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran. This would include increased use of ground-launched missiles that do not require direct line of sight, such as Hezbollah’s Iranian-manufactured Almas anti-tank missiles, as well as continued reliance on tunnels, which have proven highly effective, particularly in Gaza. New tunnels or re-excavated ones are expected to play a significant role. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The IDF’s upcoming rearmament must focus on capabilities that allow for rapid victories in short wars on enemy territory, filling gaps currently evident in the Ground Forces,' officials said. Since the war began, the Ground Forces have procured approximately 15,000 new drones for combat intelligence, 23,000 new M4 rifles, 10,000 night-vision devices for troops, 22,000 advanced sights for soldiers' weapons, 30,000 tactical helmets, 150,000 ceramic armor plates, 4,000 new vests for armored corps troops and more—all without relying on donations. The Ground Forces by the numbers The IDF on Thursday presented data highlighting the scale of its Ground Forces, the largest and most central branch of the military: 19,000 career soldiers, 4,500 civilian employees, 230,000 reservists, 133,000 spare parts, over 10,000 armored vehicles (which covered over a million kilometers or 620,000 miles in the past year), 27 prepositioned equipment bases and 571 types of munitions. During the months of fighting, the Ground Forces deployed 17 Eitan APCs, 27 new tanks, 500 perimeter cameras for armored vehicles, 28 Namer APCs, 2,000 precision mortar shells of the Iron Sting type, 15,000 shoulder launchers and more to combat units. Additionally, the IDF announced a decision to relocate observation personnel to rear command centers rather than frontline outposts in both the Gaza Division and the Galilee Division. These command centers will be situated in the sector but at a safer distance, a change implemented as part of the lessons learned from October 7. The Ground Forces have also developed a comprehensive plan to strengthen the role of observation personnel. Soon, they will be permanently equipped with weapons, such as the micro-Tavor rifles previously used by Golani and Nahal infantry troops, who have since transitioned to M4 rifles. The shift to rear command centers will be implemented gradually over the coming years as part of a new multi-year plan set to launch in January. Regarding ultra-Orthodox recruitment, the IDF expressed hope that its efforts—including ongoing dialogue with senior rabbis, draft orders sent to young ultra-Orthodox men and tailored outreach and adjustments—will yield results. The aim is to recruit members into the newly established ultra-Orthodox brigade. 'We are currently facing a manpower gap of 12,000 combat soldiers and a shortfall of 1,200 combat support troops,' officials noted. They stressed the importance of reinstating the three-year mandatory service term. Despite these challenges, they reported high motivation levels for combat service, with rates nearing 100% in various units during the last August recruitment cycle. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skakql14yl	2024-12-05T08:23:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/05/HJe9gK41N1l/HJe9gK41N1l_1_129_1601_901_0_small.jpg
Manhunt underway in New York for killer of UnitedHealth's Brian T...	The words 'deny,' 'defend' and 'depose' are carved into the shell casings found at the scene, police sources say, evoking the title of a book critical of the insurance industry New York City police were searching on Thursday for the man who killed UnitedHealth executive Brian Thompson in a brazen attack outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel before fleeing into Central Park. Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealth's insurance unit, was shot from behind on Wednesday morning in what police described as a targeted attack by a masked assailant lying in wait. It came just before the company's annual investor conference at the Hilton on Sixth Avenue. The words 'deny,' 'defend' and 'depose' were carved into the shell casings found at the scene, police sources told ABC and the New York Post. Reuters has not independently verified that information. The words evoke the title of a book critical of the insurance industry published in 2010 titled 'Delay Deny Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don't Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It.' The author, Jay Feinman, a professor emeritus at Rutgers University Law School, wrote, 'Sorry, no comment' in an email when contacted by Reuters. Investigators have not named a suspect and were still looking for a motive, police officials said at a Wednesday press conference. 'Every indication is that this was a premeditated, preplanned, targeted attack,' New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch told reporters on Wednesday. Security video showed the shooter behind Thompson, 50, raising his handgun and firing at his back. Police said the gunman arrived outside the hotel several minutes before Thompson and waited for him to walk past before firing, ignoring other passers-by. The suspect, wearing a hooded sweatshirt and ski mask and wearing a gray backpack, fled on foot before mounting an electric bike and riding into Central Park, police said. Police have searched a hostel on Manhattan's Upper West Side where the suspect is believed to have been staying, CNN reported. While he appeared to wear a mask most of the time at the hostel, investigators have recovered at least one image of his face without a covering, the network reported, citing law enforcement sources. Police published a number of photographs of the suspect taken from video cameras in the area, including one with the gun raised and pointed toward Thompson and another of the suspect fleeing on a bike. Other photos captured a glimpse of his eyes, brow and the bridge of his nose as he stood in a cafe, with a caption asking the public for any help in identifying the man. The city has a vast network of cameras, largely built following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, that police can use to track suspects' movements. The killing took place on the morning of the city's annual Christmas tree lighting at Rockefeller Center a few blocks away. The event went ahead as planned under heavy security. UnitedHealth is the largest U.S. health insurer, providing benefits to tens of millions of Americans, who pay more for healthcare than people in any other country. Thompson, a married father of two, had been the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, a unit of UnitedHealth Group, since April 2021. The company has been grappling with the fallout from a massive data hack of its Change Healthcare unit that provides technology for U.S. healthcare providers, disrupting medical care for patients and reimbursement to doctors for months. Thompson had worked at UnitedHealth since 2004 in several divisions, according to a biography later removed from the company's website. 'Our hearts go out to Brian's family and all who were close to him,' the company said in a statement. Thompson's wife, Paulette, told NBC News on Wednesday that he had been receiving some threats related to his job but said she did not know the details. 'Brian was an incredibly loving, generous, talented man who truly lived life to the fullest and touched so many lives,' she said later in a statement. 'Brian was an incredibly loving father to our two sons and will be greatly missed.' Police in Minnetonka, Minnesota, where UnitedHealth is based, and in nearby Minneapolis do not have any records of threats against Thompson. In Maple Grove, Minnesota, where Thompson lived, police administrator Theresa Keehn told Reuters there were no reports of threats to Thompson, but there was one reported incident of 'suspicious activity' at his home in June 2018. Paulette Thompson was getting ready for bed when she reported seeing the deadbolt turning on their front door, the police report said. She hid in the bathroom 'terrified', but police found no sign of an attempted break-in and no one on the property.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sylpx8y4kl	2024-12-05T07:55:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/05/S1BahrkVJx/S1BahrkVJx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Top photos of 2024: The images that captivated the world	From an Israeli soldier in a Tel Aviv bakery to missile interceptions in Iran's attack on Israel, Trump’s iconic photo and US student protests—Reuters’ most-viewed Instagram posts of 2024 captured dramatic moments that defined the year through the lens A photo of a female soldier in civilian clothes carrying a weapon at Tel Aviv’s Babka Bakery ranked fifth among the most-viewed Instagram posts of 2024 by Reuters, the world’s largest news agency. Even without the soldier’s photo, captured by Serbian photographer Marko Đurica, the wars in Gaza and Lebanon dominated the list, with 17 out of 53 entries related to the conflicts. The 11th spot featured an image of a vehicle from the World Central Kitchen (WCK) convoy in Deir al-Balah, which was struck by the IDF, resulting in the deaths of seven WCK staff members. Israeli photographer Amir Cohen took the 15th spot with a photo capturing the interception of Iranian missiles over Ashkelon last April. Another of his images, documenting the second wave of the Iranian attack in October, ranked 35th. Right after Cohen's first image, in 16th place, was a photo of a Palestinian woman, Buthayna Abu Jazar, mourning over the body of her son Hamza, killed in an Israeli attack on Rafah last May. At 19th was a photograph of a two-year-old girl receiving treatment in a hospital for third-degree burns following an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon. The 21st spot went to an image of members of the 'Squad,' the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, wearing keffiyehs during President Joe Biden’s speech in Congress last March. The photo featured Rashida Tlaib, Summer Lee and Cori Bush. At 29th place, an Iranian teenage girl cries out to the heavens during the funeral of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Tehran. At 39th, a photo of Rachel Goldberg-Polin, the mother of Hersh, who was kidnapped on October 7 and killed in Hamas captivity, breaking down during her speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Putin in North Korea, Biden bites a baby The top spot went to a stunning image of an airplane passing by the total solar eclipse over North America on April 8 this year. In second place was a photo of Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un laughing together during a car ride in Pyongyang. Adding to the bizarre category, the eighth spot featured a playful image of U.S. President Joe Biden nibbling on a baby’s leg during the traditional White House Halloween celebration.

What went wrong on October 7?	After the Civilian Commission’s report, the state comptroller takes the lead—but will it bring answers? For 14 months, Israel has grappled with the agonizing question: How did the events of October 7 unfold, and who is responsible for the failures that allowed the tragedy to occur? These questions haunt victims, their families, and a nation desperate for answers—not just to assign blame but to heal, grow, and ensure that such a disaster never happens again. As countless victims and their loved ones have voiced, understanding what went wrong is essential for closure and for strengthening the country’s ability to prevent and respond to future threats. 'We have to conduct a proper investigation so that we know what to fix,' said Eyal Eshel, father of Sgt. Roni Eshel, an observer soldier who was killed at the Nahal Oz base on October 7. However, the government and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have been reluctant to launch a formal investigation. Such an inquiry would likely be led by a team established by the Knesset’s State Control Committee. Instead, over the past several months, a civilian committee has carried out its own investigation and presented limited recommendations. The IDF has conducted isolated reviews of specific incidents in a few affected communities, but little progress has been made toward a comprehensive inquiry. At the end of November, an agreement between the state comptroller and the IDF finally paved the way for a formal review to begin. This framework allows the investigation to proceed while enabling the IDF and its commanders to maintain focus on the ongoing war and internal learning processes. According to the Supreme Court’s recent decision, core reviews of the events of October 7 are set to begin in the first quarter of 2025, taking into account the wartime circumstances. Once completed, the reports from these investigations will be submitted to the State Control Committee, alongside findings from the Civilian Commission of Inquiry, which presented its report earlier this week. Together, these documents could provide the foundation for a broader trial led by an investigative committee appointed by the Knesset. Advocates hope this process will lead to meaningful reforms and accountability. Eshel, who was deeply involved in the work of the Civilian Commission, acknowledged the challenges ahead. 'It will be hard for the state comptroller to move forward, but [Israel’s state comptroller and ombudsman] Matanyahu Englman and his team will break the glass ceiling. There is no other choice,' he said. While critics argue that the effort comes too late and may prove insufficient, insiders close to the process assured The Media Line that the results will likely shake the country and bring long-awaited answers to light. 'In any responsible, well-ordered organization, a complex activity will be followed by an in-depth investigation so that lessons can be learned from experience and conclusions can be drawn for professional, organizational conduct should the need for further activity arise in the future,' stressed Prof. Asa Kasher, a professor emeritus of professional ethics and philosophy and a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University. 'The investigation should focus on the activity’s most important aspects... However, to improve the organization and the outcome of its future activities, other aspects will have to come into play,' he added. Inside the state comptroller’s investigation: A comprehensive approach The Media Line received an exclusive briefing on how the state comptroller’s investigation will be conducted. The process will involve approximately 200 people working across various aspects of the audit, focusing on two primary areas: the events of October 7 and the government’s management of the aftermath. The first area of investigation centers on the day of the attack. The comptroller’s office will scrutinize the roles of the country’s politicians, the army, intelligence agencies, and others. Critical questions will be asked: What happened along Israel’s southern border? Why was the IDF unprepared? Were there warning signs that such an attack could occur, and, if so, why were they ignored? Did security officials know about the Nova Festival, and why wasn’t it better protected? The investigation’s second focus will be on Israel’s management of the homefront after the attack. This includes how the government handled support for civilians—such as grants, economic assistance for small businesses forced to close, and the allocation of the war budget. It will also examine the evacuation and identification of the injured and deceased and the evacuation of residents from vulnerable areas in Israel’s North and South. Additionally, the audit will delve into the mental health support provided to citizens, identifying gaps and areas for improvement. Around 60 areas will be investigated, with half to two-thirds focusing on how the government has managed the civilian population in the 14 months since the attack. 'No one will be spared,' The Media Line was told, indicating that even top ministers and senior army officials will be held accountable. The comptroller’s findings are expected to include the names of those deemed responsible and recommendations for action, ranging from resignations to potential criminal trials. Although a few high-ranking military personnel have already stepped down, citing their failure to act effectively on October 7, some argue that such resignations lack substance. As Kasher told The Media Line, 'Immediate resignation has only symbolic value and not even that when the commander admits his failure and overall responsibility for a failure he did not prevent. His resignation has value only if it comes after an investigation and a process leading to an improvement in the unit’s activities. Merely replacing one commander with another does not guarantee improvement. There has to be a solid foundation for every step in the process, which also includes resignation and replacement.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Office of the State Comptroller’s authority is comparable to that of a parliamentary investigative committee, but the process differs slightly. A parliamentary committee would conduct public hearings, whereas the comptroller’s work is carried out behind closed doors, ensuring confidentiality during the investigation. However, the final reports will be presented publicly. The comptroller also holds unique legal powers, including the ability to subpoena individuals for interviews and access all necessary documents, even classified ones. This ensures a level of accuracy and thoroughness that surpasses the work of the Civilian Commission. Civilian report highlights failures leading to October 7 The Civilian Commission’s report was delivered this week to MK Mickey Levy, chairman of the State Control Committee. However, Eshel explained to The Media Line that the full report has not yet been shared with the public due to its sensitive information. Portions that could be disclosed were presented during a public briefing in Tel Aviv last month. The report, compiled over more than four months, is based on testimony from approximately 120 witnesses. According to a spokesperson interviewed by The Times of Israel, it aims to help victims’ families understand what happened to their loved ones while pressuring the government to launch its own formal investigation. 'Imagine if after 9/11 there wasn’t an investigation,' the spokesperson told The Times of Israel. 'I don’t think anyone can even imagine this.' The commission placed significant blame for October 7 on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing him of fostering a disconnect between Israel’s political and military leadership. This division, the report asserts, left the country unprepared for the unprecedented attack. The commission also criticized the IDF and the Israel Security Agency, stating they had 'completely failed to fulfill their sole objective — protecting the citizens of Israel.' The report revealed that Israeli leadership had been warned that relying on Qatari cash transfers to pacify Hamas could be a flawed strategy, yet the warnings went unheeded. Alarmingly, the IDF had obtained what appeared to be Hamas’s plans for the October 7 assault a year earlier but failed to prepare for the possibility of a large-scale invasion adequately, the report said. The commission also criticized the defense establishment for shifting its focus to a 'small and smart army,' overly reliant on technology to secure borders, at the expense of training soldiers and maintaining sufficient ground forces. The report concluded by calling for sweeping reforms to decision-making processes at all levels of government. It recommended implementing more vigorous checks and balances and establishing a cohesive national security strategy. A bill requiring the government to develop such a strategy is progressing through the Knesset. While the Civilian Commission’s report represents an important first step, Kasher noted its limitations. The volunteers who compiled it—himself included, though he stepped down from the role some time ago—did not have the authority to compel testimony from individuals. Kasher emphasized that the state comptroller’s investigation will likely prove more effective due to its broader powers. Ultimately, however, he believes a comprehensive and official state inquiry will still be necessary to fully address the failures and ensure accountability. The ICC vs. Israel’s domestic inquiries None of these reports will address the actions being scrutinized by the International Criminal Court (ICC), which is investigating whether Israel harmed the Palestinian people during the past 14 months of war. To respond effectively to the ICC, Israel would need to confront similar questions. However, the Office of the State Comptroller or any other body conducting these inquiries is not currently focused on addressing international allegations. Israel has previously undertaken such investigations. In 2010, the government appointed an independent public commission of inquiry, led by former Supreme Court Justice Jacob Turkel, to examine whether Israel’s naval blockade of Gaza and its actions during the takeover of the Mavi Marmara—part of a Turkish flotilla bound for Gaza—complied with international law. 'A responsible investigation of war will, of necessity, shed light on many aspects of the overall picture,' Kasher observed. The pressing question remains: Will the comptroller’s findings pave the way for a government-mandated investigation under a comprehensive state committee? 'In the end, it will happen,' Eshel said.

Syrian rebels enter Hama, pushing army from key city	Capture of Hama, which had remained in government hands throughout the civil war triggered by a 2011 rebellion against Assad, to send shockwaves through Damascus and fears of a continued rebel march south Syrian rebels ousted pro-government forces from Hama on Thursday, bringing the insurgents a major new victory after a lightning advance across northern Syria and dealing a new blow to President Bashar al-Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies. The Syrian army said it was redeploying outside the city 'to preserve civilians lives and prevent urban combat' after what it called intense clashes. Rebels said they had taken districts in the city's northeast and had seized the central prison, freeing detainees. Al Jazeera television broadcast what it said were images of rebels inside Hama, Syria's fourth largest city, some of them meeting civilians near a roundabout while others drove in military vehicles and on mopeds. The rebels took the main northern city of Aleppo last week and have since pushed south from their enclave in northwest Syria. The next target of the insurgents is likely to be the central city of Homs, the country’s third largest. Homs is about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Hama. Their capture of Hama, which had remained in government hands throughout the civil war triggered by a 2011 rebellion against Assad, will send shockwaves through Damascus and fears of a continued rebel march south. Assad relied heavily on Russian and Iranian backing throughout the most intense years of the conflict, helping him to claw back most territory and the country's biggest cities before frontlines froze in 2020. As his forces swept into Hama the main insurgent commander Abu Mohammed al-Golani issued a video statement warning against any involvement by the other main regional force that is backed by Iran - Iraq's Hashd al-Shaabi militias. 'We urge him (Iraq's prime minister) again to keep Iraq away from entering into the flames of a new war tied to what is happening in Syria,' Golani said. Key city Hama lies more than a third of the way from Aleppo to Damascus and its capture would open the road for a rebel advance on Homs, the main central city that functions as a crossroads connecting Syria's most populous regions. Hama is also critical to the control of two major towns with big minority religious communities -- Muhrada, home to many Christians, and Salamiya where there are many Ismaili Muslims. Although Hama had not previously been taken by rebels during the war it was historically a center of opposition to the Assad dynasty's rule. In 1982 Muslim Brotherhood activists rose up in revolt there and the military launched a devastating three-week assault that killed more than 10,000 people and would come to be seen as a model for Assad's campaign against the rebels. Golani referred to that bloody episode in his statement, saying 'the revolutionaries have begun entering the city of Hama to cleanse that wound that has persisted in Syria for 40 years'. Advance The most powerful rebel faction is the militant Sunni Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the former al Qaeda affiliate in Syria. Golani, its leader, has pledged to protect Syria's religious minorities and has called on them to abandon Assad, but many remain fearful of the insurgents. On Wednesday, Golani visited Aleppo's historic citadel, a symbolic moment for rebels who were driven out of the city in 2016 after months of siege and intense fighting, their biggest defeat of the war. Aleppo was Syria's biggest city before the war. HTS and the other rebel groups are trying to consolidate their rule in Aleppo, bringing it under the administration of the so-called Salvation Government they established in their northwestern enclave. Aleppo residents have said there are shortages of bread and fuel, and that telecoms services have been cut. The rebel forces advancing on Hama have included a Turkey-backed insurgent coalition called the Syrian National Army, which holds a strip of territory along the Syrian-Turkish frontier, rebel sources said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Turkey, which designates HTS as a terrorist organization, has long been the biggest external backer of other rebel factions and its role will be critical to the future of any enlarged insurgent region in Syria. Ankara has denied having taken part in the rebels' sudden sweep into Aleppo last week. The return of full-blown civil war in Syria after years of frozen frontlines risks further destabilizing a region ablaze from conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. At the height of the conflict a decade ago, regional and global powers backed rival forces across the country and the chaos created space for Islamic State to seize territory that it used as a launchpad for attacks around the world. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry3grmjekx	2024-12-05T05:03:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/05/SJb2rQy4yl/SJb2rQy4yl_0_0_996_561_0_small.jpg
Amazon successfully tests using delivery drones in Italy	Amazon said on Thursday it had successfully completed an initial test of using delivery drones in Italy, the first European country where the e-commerce giant plans to introduce the service. The test was carried out on Wednesday in San Salvo, a town in the central Abruzzo region. 'The company continues to work with Italian authorities to meet all the requirements needed to launch the service next year,' Amazon said. So-called Prime Air drone package deliveries, first launched in December 2022, are currently operational in a couple of U.S. locations in Texas and Arizona, and are due to be gradually expanded, a company spokesperson told Reuters. 'Amazon delivery drones flew for the first time in Italian skies on December 4, 2024. The test flight was made with the new MK-30 drone, the highly automated drone system that uses the industry-leading Amazon computer vision program,' its statement said on the test in Italy.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by55ym1vjg	2024-12-05T04:25:33-08:00

Michael Bloomberg donates $27.8 million to reconstruction in nort...	The richest Jew in the world, through the Bloomberg Sagol Center, will oversee the program; Moshe Davidovich, head of the Meta Asher Regional Council: 'Thanks to Bloomberg and other amazing donors who have opened their hearts and pockets, I am convinced that we will not only rehabilitate the North, but lead it to a prosperity that it has never seen' Billionaire Michael Bloomberg, whose fortune is estimated at $102 billion dollars, according to Forbes, announced that he will donate 100 million shekels, about $27.8 million, to the reconstruction of the areas in the north that were damaged by the war. Senior officials in local governments estimate that this is only an initial investment. James Anderson, a senior official at the Bloomberg Foundation, wrote in a letter to the heads of the northern municipal authorities: 'We ask to stand by you, the heads of the authorities in the north and the south, and help with the challenges of reconstruction and growth. It is clear to us that the challenges you are facing will require an overall strategic vision, with critical local needs, to bring a comprehensive regional development boom,' he wrote. 'In order to succeed in creating a common story together with the residents, a shared destiny is needed, not only in disaster, but also in growth and redevelopment.' Bloomberg will not give the money and forget about it, but plans to track what is being done with it. To this end, the philanthropy fund of the richest Jew in the world chose to lead the program the Bloomberg Sagol Center for City Leadership at Tel Aviv University, which Bloomberg established in 2022 with his Israeli partner Yossi Sagol, whose family's fortune was accumulated thanks to their activities in the business sector, including the Keter Plastik' company. 'The real war of the residents of the entire country and the residents of the north in particular, is the fight for its resurrection and not as a slogan of politicians. This war proved the strength of the citizens and Diaspora Jewry, in places where institutions have failed. Thanks to Michael Bloomberg and other amazing donors who have opened their hearts and pockets, I am convinced that we will not only rehabilitate the North, but lead it to a prosperity that it has never seen,' said the head of the Meta Asher Regional Council regional council Moshe Davidovich on Thursday morning. The plan for the restoration of the areas in the municipalities has already been put into action: the Bloomberg Sagol Center has recruited over 60 professionals who are experts in the fields of project management, some of whom will be physically placed among the 40 municipalities selected to participate in the program, and some of whom will be accompanied and trained by the professionals who work in the municipalities themselves. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In addition to the financial contribution, Bloomberg is centering the international knowledge and experience gained through the leadership program that they lead in the US by their international foundation, which three years ago opened its first branch outside the US, at Tel Aviv University. The branch operates in partnership with Harvard University. The Bloomberg-Sagol Center annually trains 40 senior municipal officials from the 20 municipalities selected to participate in the program. Half of them are heads of municipalities and half are senior professionals in those municipalities. The program was established based on Bloomberg's worldview that through local government, the most significant impact can be made on the quality of life of residents, because this is the environment in which, in the end, each person consumes most of their services from state institutions on a daily basis. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjgkfzyv1l	2024-12-05T04:03:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/05/ryFV6gkEJe/ryFV6gkEJe_0_135_1044_588_0_small.jpg

Government party establishes hotline to provide legal advice for ...	Agudat Yisrael, the faction led by Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf, established a guidance center for ultra-Orthodox youth to help them avoid military conscription, describing the initiative as a response to 'the looming threat to the Torah world' Agudat Yisrael, the political faction led by United Torah Judaism Chairman Yitzhak Goldknopf, is launching a legal advisory center to support ultra-Orthodox youth who receive IDF draft notices and wish to avoid conscription. The decision to establish the center came after a closed consultation within the party, convened by Jerusalem and Heritage Minister Meir Porush, who also chairs Agudat Yisrael's central committee. The initiative, dubbed 'The Center for Guidance on the Draft Threat,' will provide assistance of legal professionals, offering advice and guidance to individuals facing questions or warnings about potential arrest for failing to report to recruitment offices. The Hamodia newspaper, aligned with Porush, described the move as a response to 'the looming threat to the Torah world posed by judicial authorities seeking to harm the ultra-Orthodox community and the sanctity of the Torah.' According to the report, prominent rabbis, heads of yeshivas, and Hasidic leaders have called for measures to assist those seeking guidance in the face of the draft. 'Since the founding of the state, we have never faced such a grave situation, and the Torah world has never encountered a threat as significant as this,' according to Porush. 'Just as this house has always acted to protect the God-fearing community during times of hardship and decrees, we must now rise to the occasion and support the public in this time of great distress.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: While acknowledging the challenges, Porush emphasized the commitment to action: 'Even though the situation appears almost unsolvable and it’s unclear how much we can assist each individual or shield them from conscription, we are obligated to do our utmost. The center will make every effort to provide guidance and support to those grappling with this existential challenge.' Similarly, a representative is being appointed at the home of Rabbi Dov Landau, leader of the Lithuanian stream, to assist individuals who receive draft notices and seek to avoid service. While such advisory centers have previously operated in more radical circles, such as the Jerusalem Faction or Hasidic groups that abstain from participating in politics, this initiative marks a departure as it is spearheaded by a mainstream political party with members serving in the Knesset and holding ministerial roles. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rko1lwjeye	2024-12-05T03:03:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/05/08/BJLhtZYMA/BJLhtZYMA_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Crew of cargo ship rescued in Red Sea, EU naval force says	The crew of Panama-flagged cargo ship MV ISA STAR have been rescued in the Red Sea after sending a distress signal, the EU's Aspides naval mission said. 'All crew members aboard the MV ISA STAR have been rescued and will be transported to Djibouti, the nearest safe port of call,' Aspides said in a statement posted on Facebook. The vessel had reported flooding in the engine room and the master requested assistance, it said, as its crew of 20 were forced to abandon it. One maritime security source told Reuters that the ship experienced engine problems and another source said that it had reported an internal explosion. Details on the current condition of the vessel were not immediately available. The ship was about 100 nautical miles off the port of Hodeidah, Yemen, when it called for assistance, the sources said. Iran-aligned Houthi forces have launched attacks on international shipping near Yemen since November 2023 in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war between Hamas and Israel.

Muhammad was the most popular name given to baby boys in England and Wales in 2023, ousting Noah to take the top spot, official figures showed on Thursday. Muhammad had been among the 10 most popular names since 2016 and had been in second place in 2022, according to the annual list produced by the Office for National Statistics. Oliver replaced George as the third most popular. For baby girls, the top three most popular names in 2023 - Olivia, Amelia and Isla - were unchanged from the previous year. The ONS said that the world of celebrity appeared to have influenced the increased popularity of some names, citing babies named Reign and Saint after those from the Kardashian-Jenner family and a rise in those sharing the names of pop musicians such as Billie Eilish. However, it said names shared with members of the royal family, such as Charles, George and Harry, were becoming less popular.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skf41gk4yg	2024-12-05T02:35:22-08:00

Cyprus takes delivery of Israeli air defense system	Cyprus has taken delivery of an Israeli air defense system, local media reported on Thursday, as the east Mediterranean island taps new markets to upgrade its defense capabilities after the loss of key supplier Russia. TV station Sigma said the first deliveries were made on Tuesday. Cypriot officials declined to comment on the specifics of the report. 'The only thing I can say is we will, and are doing everything necessary to bolster the deterrence force of Cyprus, not only because we are a country under occupation, but an EU member state in a region of particular geo-strategic importance,' Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides told reporters on Thursday. The Barak MX anti-aircraft system will complement and eventually replace the older Russian made Tor M1. Russia has been a leading supplier of military hardware to Cyprus for decades, but deals tapered off even before a blanket ban on exports in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Those sanctions have left Cyprus's existing defense systems short of spare parts and they cannot be upgraded, a senior Cypriot source told Reuters. 'That is why Cyprus is turning to other countries of the European Union, as well as Israel. As part of that, efforts are underway to upgrade our anti-aircraft umbrella,' the source said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skrg00ejvyx	2024-12-05T00:54:53-08:00

Hague Effect: This is what an IDF soldier should do if they are a...	Dozens of complaints have been filed in various countries against IDF soldiers and officers who took part in the Gaza War; Attorney Nick Kaufman, defense attorney at the International Criminal Court, discusses the soldiers' travel risks Complaints have already been filed in foreign countries in about 30 cases, and criminal proceedings have even been initiated against IDF officers as well as combat soldiers who took part in the war in Gaza and plan to fly abroad. In light of concerns about the 'Hague effect' after the International Criminal Court decided to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant accusing them of war crimes against the Palestinians in the Gaza war, senior officers are at a higher risk of being arrested. How should discharged soldiers behave abroad? And what should one do if he is arrested while on vacation? Attorney Nick Kaufman, a defense attorney at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, answers the questions that bother hundreds of thousands of Israelis. Ynet has your guide with all the questions and answers. If I am a soldier who served in Gaza, how dangerous is it for me to fly abroad? The danger posed to IDF soldiers stems from the application of a principle called 'universal jurisdiction,' according to which certain countries in the world can arrest, interrogate, and prosecute people suspected of serious offenses, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, and incitement to genocide. Does the IDF have a 'blacklist' of soldiers that can be checked to see if someone appears on it? The IDF body responsible for handling the threat of 'universal jurisdiction' is the International Law Department in the Military Attorney General's Office. This department advises IDF commanders on the legal use of weapons on the battlefield, especially to avoid international lawsuits later. This department, with the Deputy Attorney General for International Affairs, is currently also dealing with the problem of 'universal jurisdiction,' and there is no 'blacklist.' Which countries are best avoided at the moment? The list of countries that apply 'universal jurisdiction' changes from time to time. The principle has been applied in the past even in friendly countries such as the UK, France and Spain. However, the rules for applying the principle also vary from country to country. Sometimes a complaint to the police is enough to lead to an arrest and, in other cases, approval from a senior local official such as the Attorney General or the State Prosecutor is required. How can I check before traveling whether the destination has prepared for this issue? There are many reports on the Internet by human rights organizations detailing the application of 'universal authority' in various countries. What is recommended to do before going abroad? It is recommended not to upload photos from military service to the Internet. This is a serious violation of field security and can sometimes cause damage to the image of the State of Israel. In light of the discussions initiated by South Africa at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, some countries would be happy to treat even the recording of soldiers singing racist songs as incitement to genocide. The IDF is a professional army and when it is necessary to destroy buildings or carry out other actions, it must be done efficiently, quietly and without sharing on the Internet. If I landed in a certain country and was asked by the authorities about the issue, what should I answer? It is recommended to carefully consider whether to travel to a country whose officials may ask a question on the subject. In most European countries, it is known that almost every Israeli citizen serves in the IDF. It is forbidden to lie at border checkpoints, as this can be grounds for refusal of entry to that country. If the fighting ends, will it be easier to fly abroad? The intensity of the threat will not diminish, and the situation could become even more incendiary as the fighting in the Gaza Strip subsides and the area is opened up to free tours by human rights organizations and foreign journalists.

I do not know of any insurance company that insures in the event of arrest abroad due to suspicion of criminal acts. If such an initiative were to be established, it is to be assumed that the premium for the requested insurance would be particularly high. Are officers at higher risk than soldiers? Absolutely yes, because they are closer to the decision-makers, to IDF policy, selecting targets and conducting the war. Can I be arrested abroad and prosecuted for actions taken in Gaza? In any case, evidence is needed that links an ordinary soldier to illegal acts - mere service in Gaza is not enough. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkrnn0r7yx	2024-12-05T00:37:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/20/BJN5gpiMyx/BJN5gpiMyx_1_111_1601_901_0_small.jpg

French Prime Minister Barnier resigns as country's political cris...	French Prime Minister Michel Barnier will resign on Thursday after far-right and leftist lawmakers voted to topple his government, plunging the euro zone's second-largest economy deeper into political crisis. Barnier, a veteran politician who was formerly the European Union's Brexit negotiator, will be the shortest-serving prime minister in modern French history after he hands in his resignation at around 10 a.m. No French government had lost a confidence vote since Georges Pompidou's in 1962. The hard left and far right punished Barnier in a no-confidence vote on Wednesday evening for trying to push an unpopular budget through an unruly hung parliament without a vote. The draft budget had sought 60 billion euros ($63 billion) in savings in a drive to shrink a gaping deficit. Barnier's resignation caps weeks of tensions over the budget, which Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally said was too harsh on working people. It also further weakens the standing of President Emmanuel Macron, who precipitated the ongoing crisis with an ill-fated decision to call a snap election in June. Macron, who faces growing calls to resign, has a mandate until 2027 and cannot be pushed out.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk35iyjeke	2024-12-05T00:02:13-08:00	
Syrian rebels say they have begun to enter crucial city of Hama	Syrian rebels said on Thursday they had started pushing into Hama, a major city where pro-government forces backed by intense Russian air strikes are trying to stave off a new rebel victory and halt the insurgents' lightning advance. Rebel commander Hassan Abdul Ghany posted on social media that the insurgents had begun to penetrate Hama. State media had earlier reported that pro-government forces had repelled an attack. Insurgents have been battling to try to enter Hama since Tuesday and there was heavy fighting overnight with the Syrian army and allied Iran-backed militia groups supported by a Russian bombardment, both sides said. The city lies more than a third of the way from Aleppo to Damascus and its capture would open the road to a rebel advance on Homs, the main central city that functions as a crossroads connecting Syria's most populous regions.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rybhskkvjg	2024-12-04T23:59:42-08:00	
Should Israel strike Iran before Trump takes office?	Security experts debate the strategy and timing to halt Iran's nuclear ambitions A leading security expert has said that Israel should consider attacking Iran's nuclear or oil facilities, possibly even before U.S. President Donald Trump takes office. Speaking to ILTV on this week's Insider, Colonel (Ret.) Amit Assa stated that Israel must contemplate using direct force against Iran before January 20 because 'Trump doesn't want wars. Trump wants to finish wars. So, it will be a very complicated situation to deal with – a full war – when Trump is in the White House.' In October, Israel retaliated against a missile attack by Iran with a series of targeted strikes that caused significant damage to Iran's air defense systems and missile program. Experts have suggested that those strikes may have paved the way for Israel to target key areas of Iran's nuclear infrastructure more easily. Not everyone agrees with Assa. In response to his statements, Dr. Michael Barak, a senior researcher at the Institute for Counter-Terrorism, told ILTV that while attacking Iran might be in Israel's best interest, it should not act alone. Instead, Israel should build a coalition with the United States, United Kingdom, and other moderate states, such as Germany, which recognize the danger posed by a 'lunatic, Messianic regime in Iran that could deliver a nuclear bomb. This is a danger not only to Israel but to the entire region and the international community.' Barak emphasized that Israel, following its recently signed ceasefire with Hezbollah, should use the coming month to allow IDF troops to rehabilitate and prepare for the most critical goal: 'To make sure that Iran will not have a nuclear bomb,' he said. He also highlighted the potential role of Abraham Accords countries as valuable partners in the fight against Iran, particularly after Trump reclaims the White House. The Abraham Accords were signed in 2020 under Trump. Shortly before October 7, it seemed likely that Saudi Arabia would join the pact, but the massacre halted those plans. Many believe Trump will prioritize expanding the Abraham Accords after January 20, starting with Saudi Arabia. However, Saudi Arabia has stated that it will only normalize ties with Israel if the Jewish state agrees to establish a Palestinian state. Earlier this year, the Knesset passed a bill rejecting the creation of a Palestinian state in the foreseeable future. Israeli leaders argue that such a move would reward terrorism. At the same time, analysts have told ILTV that Saudi Arabia likely understands a Palestinian state would only be established after some time. Instead, they seek a clear path to statehood, regardless of how long it might take. On the ceasefire, Barak emphasized that it does not signify peace or even long-term quiet. 'In the Middle East, a ceasefire is to reorganize for another death,' Barak said. 'So, we have to be careful with the word quiet because in the Western world when we say quiet, it's very easy. It's very comfortable for us to see that there is quiet between nations and from both sides. Nobody wants any war. But it's not what happens here in the Middle East.' Barak explained that even the Abraham Accords, which have brought economic benefits such as increased tourism and business partnerships, remain centered on power dynamics. The agreements reflect a shared understanding among the signatories that cooperation is necessary to maintain regional stability.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkcymkyv1g	2024-12-04T23:26:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/03/rkKX0REZJx/rkKX0REZJx_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

After that, Hamas terrorists kidnapped Ilan's body to the Gaza Strip. For long hours, Racheli led security forces in the battles in the kibbutz, which was occupied by hundreds of terrorists, directing the ready-alert squad and later the IDF forces.

Report: Hochstein to arrive in Beirut to monitor cease-fire	The Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, reported that U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein, who led the cease-fire talks between Israel and the terrorist organization, will soon visit Beirut to accompany the work of the committee overseeing the implementation of the agreement. Sources who spoke to the newspaper pointed to 'political inaction regarding what is happening in southern Lebanon, while Israel continues to act, and it is not understood how the government is silent and what is the vague agreement it signed.' It was also reported that the government in Beirut is expected to ask the international committee to pressure Israel to stop attacking the south of the country.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1rb6crmyl	2024-12-04T23:00:33-08:00

Egypt reveals new Gaza cease-fire proposal: Withdrawal from Rafah...	Cairo proposes that IDF forces remain in Gaza during the first 60 days, while hostages are exchanged for terrorists; Rafah Crossing into Egypt will be under the control of the Palestinian Authority Egypt proposes a new arrangement in Gaza following talks that were held at the Egyptian intelligence headquarters between Hamas and Palestinian Authority representatives. An Egyptian senior official has told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth that the new plan includes a gradual cessation of fighting in Gaza with the Israeli side withdrawing from the Rafah crossing, resulting in a preliminary 60-day cease-fire. About a week after the temporary cease-fire comes into effect, according to the Egyptian senior official, living Israeli hostages will be returned in exchange for hundreds of terrorists from Israeli prisons. During the 60-day cease-fire, Israel will maintain a military presence in Gaza. The proposal also deals with the possibility of Palestinian refugees returning to the northern Strip, as Hamas demands. The Rafah crossing is expected to be managed and supervised by the Palestinian Authority. In previous proposals, Israel demanded to supervise the crossing via cameras. In addition, according to the senior Egyptian source, Hamas and the PA will establish a management committee, which will include about 10-15 'independent Palestinian political technocrats.' The committee will be supervised by U.S. representatives. The Egyptian source emphasized that the first 60 days will be designated as a pilot for both sides and that, if the plan holds, it will be 'the end of the conflict between the parties.' As for practical feasibility, he claimed that 'Hamas is demonstrating a positive attitude' and emphasized that the organization will agree to the establishment of a committee that will reactivate the crossings. The goal is to reach an agreement before President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House. However, Hamas has yet to respond to the proposal and has not declared a change in its stance. As far as is known, the terrorist organization is still insisting on an end to the war and a complete withdrawal of Israel from the Gaza Strip. Trump wants a deal before the inauguration on January 20 Qatar is also returning to center stage while Egypt is mediating a deal. Trump's new envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed al-Thani in an attempt to reach a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip and a hostage deal before the inauguration. Currently, there are still 100 hostages in Gaza, and many of them are considered to be alive. A source involved in the talks told Reuters on Wednesday that Witkoff met Netanyahu and the Qatari prime minister at the end of November. The same source said that this shows that Qatar has in fact renewed its involvement as a key mediator, after announcing that it was ending its role last month. He said that the Hamas representatives are expected to return to Doha soon and organize another round of talks. Witkoff met the Qatari prime minister on November 22 in Doha. 'Both agreed that a cease-fire is needed before the inauguration and then we can move on to other issues, such as stabilizing Gaza and the region,' the source said. A day later, Witkoff met with Netanyahu in Jerusalem. Trump's envoy also met with the hostages' family members. 'He spoke with them about the efforts of Trump's team to reach a deal before the inauguration,' the source said. According to the report, on November 24, two days later, Prime Minister al-Thani flew to Vienna and secretly met with Mossad chief David Barnea, who has been leading the negotiating efforts with Qatar for the past 14 months. 'There are plans for another round, but no dates have been set yet,' he said. In an interview with the British network Sky News, the Qatari prime minister said that Trump wants to reach a deal before he takes office, expressing cautious optimism.

The problem here is looks due to Netanyahu's inability to allow the image of Hamas returning to power. But despite the cautious optimism in Israel, senior Hamas officials said that they are 'waiting for a change in the Israeli position.' Hamas is still standing by its demands: a cessation of fighting, the full withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza, a promise to rebuild the Strip and the introduction of intensive aid. On the other hand, Fatah officials who are discussing the 'day after' with Hamas and Islamic Jihad said that there has been progress regarding Hamas's consent to the joint committee to manage the Gaza Strip. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byikcacxke	2024-12-04T22:32:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/27/BJPNZehlye/BJPNZehlye_0_0_853_481_0_small.jpg
Riyadh, Abu Dhabi 'dismayed' by Tel Aviv leadership, expert says	Brian Katulis: 'There’s nothing more than a reactive crisis management plan' The Israeli leadership lacks a clear plan to build partnerships across the region, which is disappointing its Abraham Accords partners and potential partners, according to Brian Katulis, Senior Fellow for U.S. Foreign Policy at the Middle East Institute. 'I spent a lot of time in places like Riyadh and Abu Dhabi recently, and there's just dismay about the overall situation that Iran is provoking here with Hezbollah and Hamas, but also dismay about the core leadership they see not just from Washington, D.C., but also from Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. There’s nothing more than a reactive crisis management plan that focuses on protecting its own citizens but lacks a vision for what’s next and the opportunities around the region,' Katulis told ILTV.

‘The Children of October 7’: Montana Tucker premieres emotional f...	Tucker to ILTV: 'I've done a lot of incredible things in my life, but this, by far, is the most important' It was a moving and emotional night at the Museum of Tolerance in Jerusalem, where former hostages, families of hostages, and child survivors of the October 7 massacre gathered for the premiere of the documentary film 'The Children of October 7.' The film, presented by singer, dancer, actress, and pro-Israel activist Montana Tucker, shares the testimonies of the children who survived the horrors of Hamas' massacre and showcases their incredible resilience. 'I said this up there, and I'll say it again: I've done a lot of incredible things in my life, but this, by far, is the most important, the most meaningful, most impactful thing that I think I'll ever be able to do,' Tucker told ILTV. 'These children that I've met and these stories that I've heard will stay with me forever. 'And you know, it's something I say about just Israelis in general, the strength and resilience. But people don't understand what these kids have really gone through, and what they continue to go through,' Tucker continued. 'I interviewed them a year after the attack, and you still see the trauma, and you still see what they are going through every day—the loss of their parents, the memories of them being a hostage. But their stories need to be heard and told everywhere, especially with all the denial that is going on in the world.' Tucker said that she lives in America but has visited Israel many times since October 7 because she feels the need to 'be here on the ground to share the personal stories. And I think this documentary is going to really open a lot of people's eyes.' The screening was attended by Israel's President Isaac Herzog and First Lady Michal Herzog, who, along with Tucker, met with the children and their families ahead of the premiere. Among the many testimonies in the film is the harrowing story of 16-year-old Rotem Matias, who witnessed the murder of both of his parents by Hamas terrorists. He hid under his deceased mother's body for hours, allowing him to survive. Eitan Yahalomi, 12, was taken hostage into Gaza and held captive for 52 days before being released in a hostage deal. The film highlights the enduring trauma he and the other children continue to face. 'My grandparents are Holocaust survivors,' Tucker said. 'I grew up hearing their stories my whole life. My grandmother was 13 years old, and she was taken to Auschwitz and had to see her mother get beaten up and dragged to her death in the gas chambers. And I grew up hearing those stories, and so hearing the stories of these children reminded me so much of my grandmother and the stories that she would tell me.' Tucker said she is grateful she was asked to take part in the project. 'You know, I do a lot with children when it comes to dancing and singing. If you look through my social media, you'll see that. So, this was an extension of me, and to work with children in such a different way,' she told ILTV. 'I'm really honored that they [the children] felt comfortable enough sharing their stories with me.' Tucker added that she hopes the film will help combat the denial of the atrocities of October 7 and the growing tides of antisemitism, particularly among the younger generation. Following the ceremony, Tucker and Museum of Tolerance CEO Jonathan Riss toured the museum exhibit 6:29, From Darkness to Light, which features personal testimonies of 25 brave women who survived the Hamas massacre. 'We have more than 30 screens, and each one of them has more than 40 testimonies in English, Arabic, and Hebrew of women,' Riss said. 'Each one of them tells the story of how she experienced the atrocities. The important part of it is that every day we added more and more testimonies. We have Muslims and we have Jews, and we have Christians, and it doesn't matter which religion it is, whether it's Bedouins, whether it's Israelis that live in the South or the North, they all experienced it in different ways. And I think the exhibition helps us to connect people from different walks of life.' Riss said the final message, however, should be one of hope. 'At the end of the day, the good, the goodness will win, the good people will win,' he told ILTV. 'We call it From Darkness to Light because the light was huge.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjh2jca7ke	2024-12-04T22:07:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/05/B1sYeAAQkl/B1sYeAAQkl_0_261_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Trump wants a deal before the inauguration as Qatar returns as ne...	The country that hosted Hamas leaders for years is returning to center stage, in an attempt to reach a hostage deal by January 20; Trump's newly appointed hostages envoy met with Netanyahu and the Qatari prime minister - who met in Vienna with the head of the Mossad Donald Trump's Middle East envoy has traveled to Qatar and Israel to kickstart the U.S. president-elect's diplomatic push to help reach a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal before he takes office on Jan. 20, a source briefed on the talks told Reuters. Steve Witkoff, who will officially take up the position under Trump's administration, met separately in late November with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, the source said. Witkoff’s conversations appear aimed at building on nearly 14 months of unsuccessful diplomacy by the Biden administration, Qatar and Egypt aimed at a lasting ceasefire between Israel and militant group Hamas in Gaza and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages held in the enclave. The meetings also signal that the Gulf state of Qatar has resumed as a key mediator after suspending its role last month, the source said. The source added that Hamas negotiators would likely return to the Qatari capital Doha for more talks soon. Biden's efforts continue President Joe Biden's aides have been aware of Witkoff's contacts with Israeli, Qatari and other Middle East officials and understand that Trump's envoy supports a Gaza deal along the lines the administration has been pursuing, a U.S. official said. The Biden administration, rather than Witkoff, retains the U.S. lead in efforts to revive negotiations toward a cease-fire in Gaza. Hamas leaders held talks with Egyptian security officials in Cairo on Sunday. President Joe Biden's team has kept the Trump camp updated, but the two sides have not worked together directly, the U.S. official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Biden administration does not see a need to coordinate with Witkoff because it regards his discussions with regional players as largely an effort to learn the issues rather than negotiations, the official said. Trump's transition team and representatives for Witkoff did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the meetings. Trump warned on Monday there would be 'hell to pay' in the Middle East if hostages held in the Gaza Strip were not released prior to his Jan. 20 inauguration. Witkoff holds regional talks Witkoff is a real estate investor and Trump campaign donor with business ties to Qatar and other Gulf states, but he has no prior diplomatic experience. He met Sheikh Mohammed, who also serves as foreign minister, in Doha on Nov 22. 'Both agreed a Gaza ceasefire is needed before Trump's inauguration so that once the Trump administration takes office it can move onto other issues, like stabilizing Gaza and the region,' said the source, who was briefed on Witkoff's meetings and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Witkoff met Netanyahu in Israel on Nov 23. Qatar's foreign ministry and the Israeli prime minister's office did not respond to Reuters' request for comment. Witkoff also met families of Israeli hostages, an Israeli official told Reuters. He 'spoke with them about Team Trump's efforts to try and broker the deal before inauguration,' the official said. Sheikh Mohammed traveled to Vienna on Nov. 24 to meet the director of Israel's Mossad spy agency David Barnea, who has led Israel's talks with Qatar over the last 14 months. 'There are plans for a subsequent round of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas to take place potentially in Doha soon, but no specific date has been set,' the source said.

Trump's warning about hostages - 'hell to pay' Speaking about Trump's warning on Monday there would be 'hell to pay' if hostages in Gaza were not released by his inauguration, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Reuters on Wednesday his comment was a 'powerful reflection' of the urgency for a ceasefire and hostage deal among both Trump's Republicans and Biden's Democrats. 'We're going to pursue every avenue we can in the time that we have left to try to get the hostages back and to get a cease-fire. And I think the president-elect's statement reinforces that,' Blinken said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ps330q1l	2024-12-04T20:49:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/04/HyIQqHCmJe/HyIQqHCmJe_0_0_853_480_0_small.jpg

Trump asks Georgia appeals court to end state case against him	President-elect Donald Trump asked a Georgia Appeals Court on Wednesday to end the criminal case against him in that state for attempting to overturn his 2020 election loss. Lawyers for Trump argued that his continued prosecution by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who has also charged several of Trump's allies, would violate the U.S. Constitution as he prepares to return to the White House next month. They urged the appeals court to remove Trump from the proceedings and to order a lower court judge to dismiss the case against Trump in its entirety. Federal prosecutors have already dropped two criminal cases against Trump based on a Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president. In Georgia, Trump and 14 others face racketeering and other charges for allegedly forming a criminal conspiracy to reverse Trump's narrow defeat in the battleground state in the 2020 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and has argued that the case, and others he has faced, were politically motivated attempts to damage his campaign.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjhdtl0qkl	2024-12-04T13:37:34-08:00	
Trump's pick for hostage affairs envoy: 'US troops should rescue ...	Adam Boehler, who negotiated the Abraham Accords, and who was Jared Kushner's college roommate, has been appointed special envoy for hostage affairs by US President-elect Donald Trump; 'Will work tirelessly to bring our Great American Citizens HOME' United States President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday named Adam Boehler as his special envoy for hostage affairs. Boehler acted as the negotiator on Trump's behalf in the Abraham Accords between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. 'He has negotiated with some of the toughest people in the World, including the Taliban, but Adam knows that NO ONE is tougher than the United States of America, at least when President Trump is its Leader. Adam will work tirelessly to bring our Great American Citizens HOME,' Trump said in a statement after announcing the appointment. Boehler, who is Jewish who was Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner's college roommate, thanked Trump for 'the opportunity and honor to serve you and our great nation.' In a tweet on the X he wrote: 'There is nothing more important than bringing Americans home. Under Donald Trump’s leadership, there will finally be action and consequences. We will BRING THEM HOME.' There are still 101 hostages both living and dead in Gaza, including American citizens. Boehler, 45, was born in Albany, New York, to Jill and Richard Boehler. He founded Rubicon Founders, a health care investment company. Today he lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with his wife Shira and their four children, where they are active in the local Jewish community. He is considered someone who expresses a firm voice in his support for Israel, and since October 7, 2023, he has expressed his views many times in the media. After the Hezbollah pager attack and the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, Boehler even expressed hope that the developments would lead to the 'Abraham Accords on steroids.' 'Israel's effort is amazing, and Nasrallah was perhaps the most important person they could eliminate,' he said at the time. 'They blew their brains out and maybe we shouldn't use that term because it's a bit literal. They also helped the Lebanese government by eliminating Hezbollah.' . Boehler also attacked President Joe Biden for having a 'double standard' when he demanded a cease-fire in Gaza. 'This is unfair and unprecedented. We need to remember who our allies are. These are not Hamas terrorists, these are Israel and the modern Arab states,' he said. In an opinion piece he published on the news website The Hill, Boehler called for a stronger U.S. position in efforts to bring home the American hostages, including a military raid by U.S. commando forces in Gaza. 'The Biden administration has reverted to a philosophy of hostage rescues that sees a military operation as a last resort. This approach cedes the upper hand to hostage takers, who feel emboldened to capture Americans with little fear of paying for it with their lives,' he wrote. 'American servicemembers are more than equipped to pull off a rescue. In the wake of the failed mission to rescue Americans held hostage by Iran in 1980, U.S. Special Operations teams were rebuilt to achieve what President Jimmy Carter’s aborted raid could not,' he also wrote. 'Today, U.S. special operators have a strong track record of successfully infiltrating hostile environments to rescue hostages. Those averse to an American military presence inside Gaza must remember that a single, surgical raid is not the same thing as a protracted U.S. military presence.' Boehler previously served as CEO of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, a new federal agency created during Trump's first term to manage the U.S. government's international investments, which closed in 2021. Trump also appointed him to the United States Holocaust Memorial Council. But his relationship with the Trump family began long before that, when he was the roommate of Kushner, the son-in-law of the president-elect, in the University of Pennsylvania dorms. When Kushner took on the unofficial role of designing the White House's national strategy for dealing with the coronavirus pandemic in Trump's first term, he appointed Boehler to head a task force to streamline testing at the federal level. But Boehler, who came with a background in the private sector and did not hold a medical degree, was then criticized for his performance. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: His team received $100 million to build a national strategy, but the effort was not completed, partly due to political claims that the pandemic would mainly affect 'blue' countries, i.e. democracies.

In addition, his team purchased a million defective corona tests from a company that misspelled its name on the invoice. Criticism against Kushner then focused on his favoring private sector figures like Boehler over government medical experts.

French government collapse raises questions over Ukraine support	The fall of France's government on Wednesday and the failure to pass a budget could make it difficult for Paris to ramp up its support for Ukraine despite President Emmanuel Macron's repeated promises to help Kyiv for as long as necessary. France in November completed the training of some 2,000 Ukrainians, including providing armored vehicles for troop movements and reconnaissance, Caesar howitzers, anti-tank missile units, surface-to-air missiles and battlefield radars. It also sent new missiles in recent weeks using funds from frozen Russian assets and plans to provide Mirage fighter jets in the first quarter of 2025. However, Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu, a potential future prime minister, already said in October that France would fall short of a 3 billion euro ($3.16 billion) pledge for 2024 with the figure being above 2 billion euros. By not passing the 2025 budget, which will in essence mean the 2024 budget will be reconducted next year, the defense budget would not reach its 50 billion euros target and signify a loss for the army of 3.3 billion euros, Lecornu said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hynqyscqkl	2024-12-04T12:29:53-08:00

A 'large number' of Americans' metadata has been stolen in the cyberespionage campaign carried out by a Chinese hacking group dubbed 'Salt Typhoon,' a senior U.S. official told journalists on Wednesday. In a call with reporters, the official declined to provide specific numbers but said that China's access to America's telecommunications networks was potentially broad and that there was a risk of 'ongoing compromise.' The official said the White House had made tackling the Salt Typhoon hackers a priority for the federal government and that President Joe Biden had been briefed several times on the intrusions.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h11iyrr71l	2024-12-04T12:27:57-08:00

Donald Trump's incoming Middle East envoy has met the prime ministers of Qatar and Israel to kick-start the U.S. president-elect's diplomatic push to reach a Gaza ceasfire and hostage release deal before he takes office on Jan. 20, a source briefed on the talks told Reuters on Wednesday. Steve Witkoff, the incoming envoy, traveled to Qatar and Israel in late November, the source said. The meetings signal that the Gulf state of Qatar has resumed its role as a key mediator after suspending that role last month, the source said, adding that negotiators from militant group Hamas would likely return to the Qatari capital Doha to facilitate a fresh round of talks soon.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hklcuscxke	2024-12-04T12:26:13-08:00	
We’re just functioning, not living': Young hostages still return...	After 50 days in captivity in Gaza, Emily Hand and her friend Hila Rotem Shoshani and their families recount the trauma, resilience and longing for a normal life; Their stories reflect the scars left behind and the unrelenting hope for the return of all hostages On Saturday night, during a rally in Hostages’ Square in central Tel Aviv, two young girls who usually avoid the spotlight stepped forward, feeling they could no longer stay silent. 'I told Emily I was speaking at the rally and asked if she wanted to, too,' said Tom Hand, Emily’s father. 'At first, she said no, but as we waited backstage, she suddenly said, ‘Actually, I want to speak.’' The strength Emily, 10, and her friend Hila Rotem Shoshani, 14, displayed that evening, after surviving 50 days in captivity in Gaza alongside Raaya, Hila’s mother, was the same strength that helped them endure their ordeal. 'She saw me practicing my speech, and I suggested she end it with something like ‘Bring them home,’' Tom said. 'But she asked for a pen and paper, wrote her own speech in five minutes, and it was absolutely brilliant.' 'Hila has grown up a lot,' said Raaya, a year after their release from Hamas captivity in a prisoner-for-hostage exchange deal. 'She went through so much and became tougher, but at the same time new feelings have surfaced. She struggles to sleep at night; she’s not as happy as she used to be. We’re constantly thinking about what’s happening and about Noa (Argamani) and Itay (Svirsky), whom we left behind. Every noise startles us. We don't get to walk away scar-free.' (Days after this interview, the IDF announced that it had recovered Itay Svirsky's body from Gaza in a special operation; He was killed by his Hamas captors in January.) Emily and Tom’s daily routine has also changed. 'In Be’eri, we used to wake up early in the morning, and I’d take her to the bus for school,' Tom recounted. 'Now, in Hatzor, she rides her bike to school. She’s very independent – she always has been. I didn’t raise my kids in a bubble, and Emily has a strong personality. Maybe that’s why she was able to come back from there the way she did. But still – Emily is 10 years old, and she won’t sleep in her bed alone. 'Up until three months ago, we were living in a hotel with two single beds facing each other. Now, she falls asleep with me in my bed. Recently, I started thinking that maybe she doesn’t want to sleep in her room because it’s the safe room, and that’s where she was taken from. She even prefers to sleep in the living room. When she showers, she uses the less comfortable bathroom near the living room so she knows I’m just on the other side of the wall. During the day, she moves between school, the dog kennel, and kibbutz activities. She’s never alone.' Emily and Hila were released before Raaya and didn’t know when she would return. 'Hila came home early in the morning on her birthday. In captivity, we had planned to celebrate her birthday, and then she came home, and I stayed behind. This year, we did a small correction – I made her the cake we’d talked about back then. But nothing feels like a real celebration; you don’t really feel like being happy. You just think about those still there. Every day, we were given a small bottle of water to last the entire day. Now, whenever I take water, that image comes to mind. Will this be enough for me? When I eat, I feel a sense of privilege. What are they eating? 'When I said goodbye to Itay, we planned to have a reunion in Israel. We believed there would be more exchanges, but we saw things weren’t moving in the direction we had hoped. When Noa came back, we breathed a little easier, but until everyone is back, we can’t truly breathe. It’s hard for us to leave the house, but Hila tells me, ‘Come on, put on a mask, and let’s go outside.’ In captivity, we said that when we returned, we’d travel, go abroad, and find peace. That hasn’t happened yet – we haven’t gone on vacation. Life feels like it’s on hold. We’re not really living; we’re just functioning.' 'I don’t know if I’ll ever feel like a regular kid,' Hila said. 'First, they need to bring back all the hostages, and maybe we need to return to Kibbutz Be’eri. I feel like I have a home in Hatzor, but it’s not the home. I want to go back to Be’eri, but it depends on what changes – if we’ll truly feel safer there. And yes, I want to go on a long trip with Mom, maybe to Thailand.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Honestly, for us to heal, everyone needs to come back,' Tom concluded. 'We feel it all the time. In the house next to us, the parents were murdered; on the other side, there’s another neighbor whose brother was killed. Nirit, the nurse who was in the clinic during the attack, lived near us but has left the community. Her house will likely go to Raz Ben-Ami, who has returned but is still waiting for her husband, Ohad. We’re surrounded by it; we feel it constantly. It’s always on our minds, and the weight is heavy on our chests. The dream is to bring them all back and, eventually, to return to Be’eri. 'In the end, I could have gone back to live in England at any moment. I came here just to volunteer, but when I arrived, this place chose me. I fell in love with this place—with Be’eri, with Israel, and with Israelis. We want to return to the kibbutz, but it all depends on three things: the state of Hamas, who will lead the army that let us down so deeply, and, of course, who will lead the country. As for the current leadership—I don’t trust them.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/syxtt1amkl	2024-12-04T11:56:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/03/SkgPxeR27Jg/SkgPxeR27Jg_0_0_1280_853_0_small.jpg
Israeli Air Force strikes senior Hamas terrorists Gaza	Earlier Wednesday, with the intelligence direction of the Shin Bet and IDF, the Israeli Air Force conducted a precise strike on senior Hamas terrorists who were involved in terrorist activities in the humanitarian zone in Khan Younis. Following the strike, secondary explosions were identified, suggesting the presence of weapons in the area. Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence. Earlier, the Palestinians reported that at least 20 people were killed in the attack, the target of which was senior Hamas official Osama A'nim.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj7syvcx1l	2024-12-04T11:23:39-08:00	
French government toppled in no-confidence vote, deepening politi...	French opposition lawmakers brought the government down on Wednesday, throwing the European Union's second-biggest economic power deeper into a political crisis that threatens its capacity to legislate and rein in a massive budget deficit. Far-right and left-wing lawmakers joined forces to back a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his government, with a majority 331 votes in support of the motion. Barnier was expected to tender his resignation and that of his government to President Emmanuel Macron shortly. No French government had lost a confidence vote since Georges Pompidou's in 1962. This time, Macron had ushered in the crisis by calling a snap election in June that delivered a polarized parliament. The left and far right punished Barnier for opting to use special constitutional powers to ram part of an unpopular budget, which sought 60 billion euros in savings in an effort to shrink the deficit, through parliament without a final vote. Far-right chief Marine Le Pen had said collapsing the government was 'the only way the constitution gives us to protect the French from a dangerous, unfair and punitive budget.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkoeneaxke	2024-12-04T10:59:36-08:00	
In Gaza, facing looters and price gougers: 'Where Is the Bank of ...	Violent gangs and merchants exploit war conditions, as prices soar astronomically, creating chaos and crowd crushes [Gaza City] More than one year into the deadly war, residents of Gaza are struggling to access aid amid widespread criminal activity perpetrated by violent gangs. In one of the worst incidents so far, nearly 100 aid trucks were looted by criminal groups on November 16, worsening the already dire shortages of food, medicine, and other aid supplies for the local population. These gangs, unaffiliated with Hamas, have exploited the suffering of Gazans, profiting from a smuggling industry that inflates food prices in local markets. 'The prices are absurd and completely unreasonable,' one Gazan man said. 'Just look at this crowd. Waiting four hours for a piece of bread is anything but normal.' He said that the price of a loaf of bread had risen to $7. Muhammad al-Faqawi, a 19-year-old from Khan Younis, said that the price of a bag of flour had reached as high as $250. 'If I had the chance, I would buy one. People are dying in the streets just to get a single bag,' he said. 'The rainy season is making life unbearable. Is this the future young people are destined for?' Al-Faqawi’s assertion that people are dying in the streets is no exaggeration. Recently, three women hoping to buy some pita were killed in a crowd crush in front of a bakery in Deir al Balah. 'I’ve been here since 7 o’clock, and after an entire day, I finally managed to buy a bag of bread,' one woman who witnessed the crowd crush explained. 'I couldn’t even get into the shop. People are dying just to get in. I don’t have the strength to face that.' As widespread theft and black-market price gouging keep Gazans from obtaining essential staples, Hamas has created an armed force to take control of the situation. According to Hamas’ Al-Aqsa television channel, the force killed at least 20 looters in the November 16 incident. The Hamas merchants’ office declined to comment. 'We are starving and cannot bear this situation. Prices have skyrocketed, and we can no longer afford even the basics,' al-Faqawi said. 'I want to tell the entire world, and [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu in particular, that we can’t endure this any longer. We’re not truly living.' He said that a 10-shekel coin — equivalent to around $3 — is 'useless' given the rampant inflation. 'You might as well throw it away,' he said. Moss Hamdan, a shoe repairman from Khan Younis, described the situation as 'terrible.' 'There is high demand for food, but a single can of milk costs $10. How can anyone afford that? Basic staples such as oil, sugar, and rice are in high demand, but they are far too expensive,' he said. 'I no longer have a job, and neither does anyone else. Life here is extremely difficult. Airplanes fill the sky daily, and nothing feels secure or reliable. Everything is for sale, even water. Please, make it stop.' Abdul Majeed Al-Kurd, a merchant and currency exchanger, called on authorities to address the situation. 'Merchants exploit people, forcing them to pay bribes just to survive,' he said. Al-Kurd has been working in the currency exchange market for 40 years. 'I refuse to engage with unlawful individuals,' he said, describing looting and price gouging as against Islam. 'Unfortunately, the Bank of Palestine has encouraged these practices,' he said. 'If the bank claims to promote mercy, it should send employees to the markets, pay people’s salaries, and take action to address the crisis. It must inject money into the market and take decisive action – this is its responsibility.' Tobacco has become a critical commodity in Gaza. Before the war, a packet of cigarettes cost around $5. Now a single cigarette can cost $49. For this reason, many people have found alternative ways to sell tobacco at more reasonable prices. 'We try to lower prices so people can afford to smoke,' according to Muhammad al Aqraa, a tobacco seller from Deir al Balah. 'We sell cigarettes for $7 or $8 because the economic situation is terrible. Those who had money have spent it all during the war, while some merchants continue to take advantage of others.' 'As young people, we want to smoke, but it’s simply unaffordable,' he said. Nael Abu Amara, a tobacco seller from Gaza City, said that prices for cigarettes rose from $20 to $55 over the course of a day. 'God never commanded people or merchants to treat us this way. The prices people face are unjust and unacceptable — neither we nor God can condone such actions,' he complained. Most families in Gaza have numerous children, and parents are desperately struggling to care for their most basic needs. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sharifs Al-Hajj, a mother from Deir al Balah who is pregnant, said that she has had to beg for bread to stave off hunger. She said that the price of sugar had risen from about $1.50 to $14. 'There is no electricity, no food, and no health care. There’s no margarine, chicken, chickpeas, corn — nothing at all,' she said. She said that she and her children recently experienced bombings and are in desperate need of milk, medical care and warm clothing. 'We’ve lost everything,' she said. 'We want a cease-fire. A cease-fire as soon as possible. We want it now.' The Media Line Staff contributed to this report.

6 hostages likely executed in response to IDF airstrike, investig...	Alex Dancyg, Yoram Metzger, Haim Perry, Yagev Buchshtav, Nadav Popplewell, and Avraham Munder were fatally shot in February by their Hamas captors in a tunnel in Khan Younis following an IDF strike in the area; Report finds IDF was unaware of hostages' location when approving the airstrike, which caused toxic gases to seep into the tunnel killing the terrorists The IDF on Wednesday presented its findings to the families of six hostages killed in a tunnel in Khan Younis, Gaza, earlier this year. The investigation, also shared with IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, revealed that Alex Dancyg, Yoram Metzger, Haim Perry, Yagev Buchshtav, Nadav Popplewell, and Avraham Munder were fatally shot by their captors in February. According to the findings, the hostages were likely executed in response to an IDF airstrike targeting nearby infrastructure. The strike, approved in advance, took place on February 14, but the IDF was unaware at the time that the hostages were being held in the tunnel. Their deaths were confirmed in July. The investigation also revealed that the hostages were not held together after their abduction. Dancyg, Perry and Buchshtav were initially imprisoned in a separate tunnel, referred to as the 'Kingdom,' which contained iron cages and synthetic grass. In late December, as the IDF advanced into Khan Younis, the three were transferred to a tunnel in the Qatari-funded Hamad neighborhood, where they joined Munder, Popplewell, and Metzger. The February 14 airstrike targeted senior Hamas commanders in the vicinity of the hostages. The operation involved extensive planning and was approved according to IDF protocols. 'In every operation with similar characteristics, we are extremely cautious to avoid harm to hostages. If we know hostages are present, we do not strike,' an IDF official stated. Six months later, on August 20, the IDF launched a mission to recover the hostages' bodies, based on intelligence from the Unit for Prisoners and Missing Persons. During the recovery, signs of gunshot wounds were found on the hostages' bodies, but the IDF emphasized the possibility — albeit remote — that other captors, not those whose bodies were discovered nearby, had executed them. Six Hamas terrorists' bodies were also recovered from the tunnel, showing no gunshot wounds. They were believed to have died from toxic gases released as a secondary effect of the IDF strike. IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi determined that the IDF and ISA had no intelligence regarding the presence of hostages in the area, and that, had such information been available, the strike would not have been carried out. Halevi emphasized the importance of continuing to operate in accordance with the updated strike protocols implemented after this tragic and difficult event. The Chief of the General Staff said: 'In this prolonged war, which began on a very difficult day, the mission of returning the hostages alive accompanies us at every moment. We are making every effort to bring them back. We have made significant achievements, but it is small so long as there are other hostages. The IDF is confident that the combat advances their return, but in the context of combat we have also made mistakes – we are not able to bring these hostages home alive. 'It is important for the families of the hostages and the entire public to know that thousands of soldiers and commanders are working to succeed and avoid mistakes in this critical mission. Every mistake that occurred was due to lack of knowledge, and we are committed to learning from these mistakes.' Families demand accountability Elia Dancyg-Lichtman, the granddaughter of Alex Dancyg, expressed grief and frustration following the report. 'The bottom line is that the IDF is responsible for their deaths. They didn't know hostages were in the tunnel and targeted it because of Hamas commanders. This was a severe mistake,' she said, adding that the military asked the families for forgiveness. She continued, 'The IDF didn’t ensure there were no hostages in the area before attacking. This war is killing them. My grandfather can’t be brought back, but the military must now do the right thing.' Ofri Perry, the daughter of Haim Perry, echoed similar sentiments, saying, 'We waited for the investigation because every detail matters, but we now know that my father died directly or indirectly because of the IDF's actions. The nightmare scenario we feared has come true.' She described the harrowing conditions in which the hostages were held: 'The images of the tunnel and the inhuman conditions are horrifying. The suffering they endured is a crime against humanity. The urgency to rescue those still held cannot be overstated.' The Hostage Families’ Forum urged the Israeli government to shift its strategy. 'The findings confirm that military pressure endangers the hostages. It’s time to prioritize their safe return, using diplomatic and political means rather than relying solely on military operations,' the forum stated. Residents of Kibbutz Nir Oz, home to several of the victims, issued a similar appeal: 'The hostages are not military targets. They are family members—fathers, mothers, and children who need us. Bring them home with all available tools. It is the moral and national duty of our leaders to act now.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Meanwhile, Reuters reported on an internal Hamas document warning its operatives to brace for a potential Israeli rescue mission, similar to one conducted in June. The document instructed Hamas to 'tighten' conditions for the hostages and warned that any Israeli attempt to extract them would lead to their 'neutralization.' Hamas emphasized that Israel would bear full responsibility for the hostages' fate. These developments add urgency to the ongoing efforts to resolve the crisis, as families and communities across Israel continue to wait for the safe return of those still in captivity. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rky3zwcqje	2024-12-04T08:57:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/08/20/HyNci3ZoA/HyNci3ZoA_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Jared Isaacman has flown into space twice in SpaceX spacecraft and about three months ago he became the first private astronaut to go on a spacewalk; He participated in the first private mission in space, also in a spacecraft produced by Elon Musk's company U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday tapped Jared Isaacman to lead the U.S. space agency, NASA, selecting a billionaire private astronaut and close associate of Elon Musk to oversee an agency closely linked to the SpaceX founder's businesses. Isaacman, 41, CEO of payment processing company Shift4 Payments, leads Polaris, a program that uses SpaceX spacecraft for private missions in space. If confirmed, he would oversee the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's roughly $25 billion budget heavily focused on returning humans to the moon under its Artemis program, a multibillion dollar effort promoted by Trump during his first term that will rely heavily on SpaceX's Starship. 'Jared will drive NASA's mission of discovery and inspiration, paving the way for groundbreaking achievements in Space science, technology, and exploration,' Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. Isaacman is a billionaire and pilot, who financed his own missions into space. He was the commander of the Inspiration4 mission in 2021, the first mission involving only private astronauts.

Iran dissident group says 6 members sentenced to death	Six Iranian dissidents have been sentenced to death for charges ranging from belonging to an opposition group, collusion against the state and armed rebellion, according to a ruling seen by Reuters on Wednesday and a statement from the group. The sentences from Nov. 25 come amid a rise in what Human Rights Watch said in November was a 'flurry of new death sentences' in recent weeks. The six men, part of the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK), are aged between 32-65 and have a history of opposing Iranian authorities. The group, also known by its Persian name Mujahideen-e-Khalq, was once listed as a terrorist organisation by the United States and the European Union but not since 2012. Tehran has long called for a crackdown on the NCRI in Paris, Riyadh, and Washington.

Iranian Nobel peace prize winner Narges Mohammadi was released from Evin prison after the suspension of her jail term to undergo medical treatment, her husband Taqi Rahmani told Reuters on Wednesday. Mohammadi is serving multiple sentences in Tehran's notorious Evin prison on charges including spreading propaganda against the Islamic Republic. 'Based on the opinion of the forensic doctor, the office of Tehran's Prosecutor suspended the jail sentence of Narges Mohammadi for three weeks and she was released from prison,' her lawyer Mostafa Nili said on X on Wednesday. 'The reason for this is her physical condition after the removal of a tumour and a bone grafting operation that was performed 21 days ago. Her tumour was fortunately benign but she must be examined every three months.' Mohammadi was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2023, following her three-decade campaign for women's rights and the abolition of the death penalty in Iran.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1oo5erqjg	2024-12-04T06:53:42-08:00

The Vatican on Wednesday unveiled a new open-top popemobile, an all-electric Mercedes-Benz that Pope Francis will use when he greets pilgrims in St. Peter's Square. The vehicle, a modified version of the German company's G-Class mid-size luxury SUV, has an elevated seat for Francis, so crowds have a better chance of seeing the pope. It comes in white, the traditional papal colour, and features heating in the papal seat and in a grab bar the pope can use for balance when standing in the vehicle. The Vatican did not immediately say when the new popemobile would come into service, and declined to provide any information about the vehicle's security features. Mercedes officials declined to say how much the vehicle had cost.

Hamas threatens to 'neutralize' hostages if Israel launches rescu...	Internal Hamas document obtained by Reuters warns of planned Israeli hostage rescue operation in Gaza and instructs its operatives to kill hostages if such an attempt takes place without regard for repercussions Hamas said it had information that Israel intended to carry out a hostage rescue operation similar to one conducted in Gaza's Nuseirat camp in June and threatened to 'neutralize', or kill, the captives if such an operation took place, according to an internal statement seen by Reuters on Wednesday. In the internal document dated November 22, Hamas told its operatives not to consider any repercussions of following the instructions and said Israel was responsible for the fate of the hostages. It did not say when any Israeli operation was expected to take place. Hostages Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov and Shlomi Ziv were rescued in a special operation by the security forces in early June. The four had been abducted from the Nova music festival on October 7, where they were working or spending time with their friends.

Israel issues rebuke to Lammy over humanitarian aid claims	Foreign Secretary posts on X about letter from UK, France and Germany prompting Israeli official to reply saying country doesn't impose 'restrictions' on aid delivery Israel has responded frostily to a tweet from David Lammy that followed a letter from Britain, France and Germany about the 'unacceptable humanitarian situation in Gaza'. The foreign secretary tweeted that the three countries were urging action and said that Israel 'must implement' the United Nations winter plan 'now'. Israel needed to 'send equipment to guard against cold and flooding, give access to fuel, repair vital infrastructure, and get aid in', the Foreign Secretary said. But in a sternly-worded reply, Oren Marmorstein, the Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman, said that Israel was 'facilitating the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip and does not impose any restrictions on the quantity of aid entering the Strip. However, within the Gaza Strip, international organizations are failing to distribute the aid due to looting by Hamas, among other reasons'. He added: 'As U.S. Secretary of State Blinken recently noted, Israel has responded positively to the majority of issues raised by the United States regarding humanitarian concerns'. It was 'disappointing that the Foreign Ministers of the E3 failed to address the October 7 massacre, and the daily attacks on Israeli civilians since then in their letter', Marmorstein said, adding that 'Israel will continue to defend itself and its citizens, always in accordance with international law'.

South Korean martial law declaration due to president's unpopular...	The response of the South Korean public is not surprising, Dr. Guy Podoler tells ynet the society there is stronger than to give in to such a strange move South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol surprised the world on Tuesday night with his declaration of martial law for the first time in nearly 50 years. but his controversial move was not spurred by external threats but by his desperate political troubles. Now, lawmakers will vote on whether to impeach him over what the country's main opposition has called his 'insurrectionary behavior'. Yoon's drastic decision, announced in a late-night TV broadcast, cited 'anti-state forces' and the North Korean threat as a reason. Following demonstrations and a unanimous vote in Parliament against martial law, the president reversed his decision. Now, lawmakers will vote on whether to impeach him over what the country's main opposition has called his 'insurrectionary behavior'. 'He was under tremendous domestic pressure and heavily criticized for mishandling policy issues and interfering with investigations involving his wife and himself, Dr. Guy Podoler, a Korea expert from Haifa University spoke told Ynet. 'This is a demonstration of how important democracy is for the people of South Korea. His action was surprising but the reaction was not surprising, it is difficult to understand what went through his mind. South Korean society is stronger than to give in to such a strange move,' he said. Podoler did not think North Korea could take advantage of the crisis in Seoul. 'The situation between the two Koreas is tense as North Korea designates South Korea as its enemy in an unprecedented move. I don't believe North Korea will take advantage and already the opposition said that they are going to submit a motion to replace the president.' The parliament needs two-thirds majority to impeach and after that it will go to the constitutional court that has the final say. According to Podoler, the possibility of Yoon staying in power after this stunt is extremely low. Around 23:00 p.m. on Tuesday, following the president's order, the military issued a decree banning protests and activity by parliament and political groups, and putting the media under government control. However, South Korean politicians immediately called the declaration unconstitutional. His party members from the conservative People's Power Party also joined the opposition against this bizarre move. The opposition leader, Lee Jae-myung of the liberal Democratic Party, called on South Koreans to go to the streets and converge on parliament to vote down the declaration.

Haredi lawmakers attend call to avoid draft	Meeting held in Lithuanian leader Rabbi Dov Landau's home sees United Torah Judaism MKs sit in after decree calls on all yeshiva students to stay away from recruitment offices Members of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party, part of the coalition, attended an emergency meeting on Tuesday at the home of Dov Landau, a prominent rabbi in Bnei Brak , who directed all heads of religious schools and seminaries to ensure that their students do not respond to any IDF summon or draft order and to avoid any contact with the IDF, except through yeshiva administrators. A news publication affiliated with Landau published the announcement on Wednesday, accompanied by an image of Moshe Gafni, the chair of the Knesset Finance Committee, addressing the participants. 'It’s clear to all of us that yeshiva students will not enlist in any form,' the article read. 'The uncertain situation is causing concern and tension among yeshiva heads, their students and families whose sons have received draft orders. Unfortunately, the number of those receiving summonses is increasing,' the article added.

David Amsalem, Likud, tells Netanyahu friendly outlet people will take up arms; says 'we won't let it happen' we can do things so the public will act spontaneously, judges would be prevented from entering their chambers Minister of Regional Cooperation David Amsalem of the ruling Likud Party and a close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said violent civil war would break out if any steps were taken to remove Netanyahu from power for being unable to fulfil his duties, while on criminal trial for corruption. People will take up arms, he said in an interview to a Netanyahu friendly outlet. 'This won't happen. We won't let it happen,' he said. I suppose we can make the judges stay clear of such a place and we can do other things so that the public will act spontaneously,' Amsalem said. 'If the prime minister is removed because they decided to remove him, and by that, destroy democracy, they will not be able to enter their chambers. People will come and prevent them from entering. No problem. We can do this step by step.' Netanyahu had been cleared to fill the role of prime minister despite been criminally indicted after he assured the court that he would be able to fulfil his role and defend himself during his trial. Attorney General Gali Baharv-Miara told the Supreme Court earlier that there was no reason to remove the prime minister at this time. The AG had been under attack by members of Netanyahu's government and his coalition in the Knesset who have been attempting to fire her and replace her with a more supportive AG after she blocked legislation efforts including during the attempts to change the judicial system and the balance of power between the executive branch and the courts. Netanyahu also rejected the requests to the Supreme Court for his removal and claimed the judges would be dragged into a political matter and would be subverting the democratic will of the people. The prime minister had made repeated attempts to postpone testifying before the Jerusalem District Court in his defense during his corruption trial and after he was granted a two-month delay, his final request for further postponement was rejected.

I would never have believed Israel would abandon its own, rescued...	Luis Har, who was extracted from Hamas captivity by the IDF says to this day no one from the government has called him; tells of the harsh conditions, hunger and distress he endured and his concerns for those still held in Gaza 'I would never have believed Israel would abandon its own,' rescued hostage Luis Har, 70, told Ynet in an interview on Wednesday. Har and his brother-in-law Fernando Marman, 60 were extracted from Gaza after 129 days in captivity, in an IDF operation last February. 'We were rescued, but some of us are still in there. Our hearts are broken. I never thought something like this could happen; they say that no one gets left behind in Israel, but in reality, there are 101 hostages still there,' he said. Since his return he has been campaigning in Israel and around the world for the release of the hostages. 'Our mistake lies in our public diplomacy,' he said. 'The world doesn’t know what happened on October 7; they only see the other side. Most of the people there are [aligned with] Hamas and those who weren’t were eliminated by the terrorists. I don’t trust any of them. Women and teenagers entered the kibbutz to loot and steal.' 'We can’t lose hope; I’ve always been an optimistic person. My mission now is to ensure the rest of the hostages come home. Life feels different now — until I return to the kibbutz, I won’t truly know how much I’ve changed. I want to go back to my home in the kibbutz, but it requires repairs, especially the safe room. Once that’s done, I’ll go back.' He said life as a hostage was hard. 'The little food we received came from Hamas. There were days in captivity when we only had pita bread; those in the tunnels sometimes didn’t even get that.' In an interview after he returned to Israel he told the UK's Daily Mail about the fear he lived with as a captive of Hamas. 'It was like a movie. Their barbarism... They didn't consider us at all, as if we were animals or dogs. They just trampled all over us freely. Real barbarians. As if we weren't human beings.' Har, who was with four of his family members, recounted the moments of the abduction: 'They opened a small gate and took us into a tunnel with terrorists in front, in the middle, and at the back, with guns. It was dark all the time. The only light was from the phone. There was no air. It felt like we would never get out of there.' At one point, he said, another group of terrorists began chasing them, shouting, 'Jews! Jews!' Har, originally from Argentina, shouted back: 'Argentinians, Argentinians! Messi, Messi!' The five family members eventually reached their destination. Mia Leimberg, 18, managed to hide her dog, Bella, in the tunnels without the terrorists noticing. After spending two days in one building, the family was moved to another apartment, where they stayed for 50 days in a windowless room. They gave Spanish nicknames to the terrorist guarding them and spoke as little Hebrew as possible to prevent their captors from understanding them. Har noted that one of the terrorists showed interest in Mia, joking that he was 'single and wanted to marry her.' When Har told him to stop, the terrorist mocked him, saying, 'Wow, there's a wolf here.' Later, the terrorist returned with a large knife, playing with it to 'frighten us.' Har described sleeping on dirty 'paper-thin' mattresses and surviving on scraps of pita bread. 'There was constant psychological warfare,' he said. 'They told us it wasn't advisable to wander outside, that they would beat us to death. They really made sure to tell us every failure of the IDF or every time soldiers were killed. They told us we had nowhere to return to, that Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak no longer existed.' 'They kept telling us not to speak loudly because the UAV's, if they heard us, would pass the information to Netanyahu and Netanyahu would send planes to bomb us because he doesn't want any deal, he wants to kill us. They kept repeating this to us, every day. Eventually it gets into your head,' he added. Yair Moses, son of hostage Gadi Moses and Margalit Moses who was released from captivity, told ynet on Wednesday that with the passage of time, thigs only get harder, 'but we must keep fighting to end this. I only believe in actions. We have no idea what’s happening in negotiations or who’s being spoken to — none of the families are getting information,' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The ministers are more interested in staying in power; we’re not their priority,' he added. 'Any criticism of them immediately marks you as their enemy. Fourteen months is an insane amount of time to be in captivity. We have no information about where my father is held — above or below ground — or whether he has any heating.' Has any minister reached out to your mother? 'Not that I recall, not at the beginning. She had a few meetings later on but no one’s been in touch.

IDF hands Jordan the bodies of terrorists after attack on troops	Bodies of two terrorists who infiltrated from Jordan opening fire on forces were delivered to Jordanian authorities under orders of the government Israel on Wednesday handed over to Jordan the bodies of two terrorists who infiltrated across the border earlier this year and launched an attack on IDF forces. The IDF confirmed the overnight return of the bodies of Amer Qawas and Hassam Abu Ghazala to Amman. Jordan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also confirmed receiving the bodies, and said they were handed over to their families for burial. The military spokesperson said the return of the dead terrorists was upon instructions from the government. The attack left an IDF soldier and a reservist with light to moderate injuries. The terrorists, dressed in military uniforms, infiltrated the area in the Arava Desert. They were shot dead by a reservist soldier and a female reservist who were dispatched to the scene. IDF soldiers observed the terrorists crossing the border from Jordan. According to the military, the two terrorists were stopped 'just yards from the border fence.' The force engaged the suspects along the 'smuggling route' near the border, about three yards into Israeli territory, after the terrorists opened fire with Glock pistols. One of the attackers ran out of ammunition during the exchange. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The terrorists were equipped with a wire cutter, which they used to breach the single barbed-wire fence at the border. They also carried binoculars, a map, and an Arabic-Hebrew phrasebook. After they were killed, the IDF coordinated with their Jordanian counterparts. An investigation carried out soon after the incident, revealed that they were not members of the Jordanian military, despite wearing military uniforms. The attack came after a deadly shooting attack at the King Hussein border crossing where a Jordanian citizen drove a truck across the border and opened fire on staff, killing three men. Israeli security officials have warned that the long border with Jordan has been neglected for years and was no the source of arms smuggled by Iranian operatives for use by terrorists on the West Bank. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r14rgqa7ye	2024-12-04T00:31:58-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/04/r1rOGtaQ1x/r1rOGtaQ1x_0_0_730_438_0_small.jpg

Trump wants criminal charges dropped after hunter Biden pardon	President-elect's lawyers push to clear 34 felony counts from his record in 'hush money' case citing Biden's move; judge in case calls request 'ridiculous' U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday asked a New York state judge to dismiss the criminal case in which he was convicted in May on 34 felony counts involving hush money paid to a porn star in light of his victory in the November 5 U.S. presidential election. In urging Justice Juan Merchan in Manhattan to vacate the guilty verdict and toss the charges, Trump's lawyers said having Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's case hang over him after he takes office on January 20 would impede his ability to govern. At the outset of their 72-page motion, Trump's lawyers brought up Democratic President Joe Biden's decision on Sunday to pardon his son Hunter Biden, who was convicted on gun charges and pleaded guilty to tax violations. Blanche and Bove said Biden's statement that his son had been selectively prosecuted was an 'extraordinary condemnation' of his Justice Department. Merchan last month delayed Trump's previously scheduled November 26 sentencing indefinitely to give him the chance to seek dismissal. Prosecutors with Bragg's office supported delaying the sentencing to give Trump the chance to make his case for dismissal, though they said they would oppose that bid. The prosecutors have until next Monday to respond. The judge has not indicated when he would rule on Trump's motion to dismiss, and has not set a new date for sentencing. Bragg's office has suggested he defer all proceedings in the case until Trump, 78, leaves the White House in 2029. In their motion to dismiss, Trump's lawyers called that suggestion 'ridiculous.' They said that would mean sentencing would happen more than a decade after the investigation started in 2018. In a decision made in early September, Merchan effectively granted Trump’s second request for a delay. The first took place following the trial's conclusion in May, when a New York jury convicted Trump on all charges. Trump was charged in three additional state and federal criminal cases in 2023, one involving classified documents he kept after leaving office and two others involving his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.

The Hague Effect: IDF combat soldiers at risk of arrests abroad	Israel prepares legal response after footage posted by officers, soldiers operating in Gaza distributed online exposing them to danger when overseas; at least 8 had to leave countries immediately after Pro-Palestinian organizations make blacklists The IDF estimates that the decision by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, will support arrests and other criminal proceedings around the world against senior army officers and even against mandatory service and reserve soldiers who fought in the Gaza Strip. Some have recently been required to leave countries they visited, fearing legal proceedings. The IDF recently identified about 30 cases of criminal proceedings being initiated against members of the IDF. At least eight of them, including soldiers who had already taken off to Cyprus, Slovenia, and the Netherlands – were required to leave immediately. The IDF has not imposed limits on traveling outside of Israel even during the war, but is formulating a 'risk assessment' for each soldier who submits the application form to leave the country, with an emphasis on combat soldiers and commanders who operated in Gaza. This policy was enacted due to the decision to issue unprecedented arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant, which put them in the same row with dubious leaders accused of war crimes such as Vladimir Putin and Slobodan Milosevic. Despite being forbidden to post footage from their operations in Gaza, many combat soldiers, in service and in reserves, did so and have given anti-Israel organizations the necessary information to create 'blacklists' across the world. Dozens of pro-Palestinian organizations that operate mainly from Europe but are spread across a network of representatives around the world collect the information to target IDF soldiers. These organizations, in addition to publishing the names and photos of IDF combat soldiers online, also monitor their postings on social media, in the hope that they will post stories about their next overseas trips. At that moment, a complaint will be filed against them with the local prosecutor's office, or a personal petition against them to the court in that country, in order to investigate them and delay their departure from that country. Therefore, soldiers who request a vacation abroad are instructed to avoid posting their location, so as not to become easy prey for the anti-Israel activists in the legal and security aspects. Assessing the risk The Military Prosecutor's Office estimates that the prosecutor in The Hague will not deal with soldiers or junior commanders, since they carried out instructions they received on the battlefield. Israel, in the meantime, still enjoys the right to investigate and pass judgment on its military personnel if necessary. The concern is that the ICC will act against senior officers who commanded the forces, from the division commander level and above, such as the Air Force commander and the Chief of Staff. So far, the security and legal establishment have not identified any indications that warrants have been issued for their arrests, but this threat is considered more significant. 'Individual proceedings against soldiers and junior officers who travel the world can be based on the ruling of the Hague Tribunal,' the IDF says.' To any soldier or officer, if they are arrested abroad or required to appear for questioning, and even if they feel they are being followed or photographed, Israel will provide immediate legal assistance through the local embassy or through the situation room at the Foreign Ministry.' Israel has hired legal services from local lawyers in dozens of countries around the world, so that they can monitor changes in legislation and case law in these countries regarding Israel. The lawyers monitor local activity that is taking shape against Israeli military and state officials; and, if necessary, represent and defend soldiers and officers in that country. Mossad and Shin Bet representatives also participate in the inter-ministerial team. The team issues periodic situation assessments, where an IDF service member who operated in Gaza is likely to be arrested or interrogated. For example, in a country like South Africa, any IDF soldier with South African citizenship would be held for questioning. 'In countries that are not members of the International Criminal Court, such as the U.S., China or India,' the IDF added, 'there is local legislation on the law of war. This is good because they are not obliged to act according to the arrest warrants, but they may have local legislation,' the IDF added. In an extensive article in the Washington Post, at least 11 pieces of evidence were published on Tuesday that were filmed by IDF soldiers over the past year while operating in Gaza. The videos include the explosion and demolition of buildings, mass evacuations, burning buildings throughout the Strip, the arrest of Gazan residents who appear partially clothed, and also soldier's statements which say their mission is to 'occupy, expel and settle' the Gaza Strip. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The names and faces of the IDF soldiers appearing in the article were not blurred, as the recordings were posted online by them, which damages Israel's image, but also puts the soldiers at risk around the world. 'Legal experts who examined the videos have said that most of the serious cases include soldiers actually admitting and providing evidence of possible violations of international humanitarian law,' the IDF said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjxb1y6myx	2024-12-03T23:23:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/04/B1ADawTX1e/B1ADawTX1e_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

She could die at any second': Mother of British hostage breaks s...	Mandy Damari, whose daughter Emily is being held in Gaza for over a year, says the worry for her safety is constant and criticizes British government for inaction in pursuing hostage deal The BBC on Tuesday aired an interview with Mandy Damari — The mother of Emily who has been held captive by Hamas for nearly a year and two months. She told the network she was afraid that her daughter was already dead. Emily, 28, who holds dual Israeli-British citizenship, was abducted from her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7. She is the only British national among the hostages. During the attack, Hamas terrorists killed her dog. Mandy also narrowly escaped the terrorists after hiding in her home; a bullet fired by them struck the lock of the door to the room where she was hiding, jamming it and preventing them from entering. 'If she's not dead, she's not getting enough food to eat, she's not able to wash herself, drink water, she could be ill. she's suffering from gunshot wounds to her hand and her leg... I worry every day, I worry every second because in the next second, she could be murdered, just because she's there.' Mandy Damari, born in southeast England’s Surrey, described her daughter as a Tottenham Hotspur fan who loves visiting the UK to see family, shop and go to pubs. She is currently in the UK meeting local leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, but expressed disappointment with the British government calling for it to do more to ensure humanitarian aid reaches the hostages as negotiations for their release continue. She criticized the UK government’s recent decision to support a draft UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza, arguing it doesn't do enough to ensure the hostages' release. While the draft demanded their release, the U.S. vetoed it, saying that the UN Security Council hadn’t made the release a precondition for the cease-fire. 'I felt really like they were stabbing me in the heart,' Mandy said. 'There was no prerequisite to release the hostages... It was basically signing a death warrant for her [Emily], because if there's a ceasefire with no release of the hostages, the hostages will stay there forever.' The mother said she was desperate for a sign of life. 'We talk about humanitarian aid all the time to Gaza, but I don't hear about humanitarian aid for the hostages who are held in despicable conditions. I'm desperate to get humanitarian aid into her, for someone to see her. It's a human right to allow people to see what's happening to her.' Mandy also welcomed a statement by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who said on Monday that there would be 'hell to pay' if the hostages aren’t released before he takes office on January 20. 'It made me a bit more optimistic,' she said. 'It gave me a bit of hope that maybe someone does really care about what's going on there. Someone has to do something and take strong action to get them released. And that's the strongest thing I've heard anyone say for a long time.' She said she hopes that Trump would do everything in his power to secure her daughter's release alongside the other hostages. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Mandy told the BBC she had refrained from speaking publicly about her daughter until recently, trusting the Israeli and British governments and mediators to secure her release. However, she now wants the British public to understand that her daughter is a dual national hostage.

She has no voice,' she said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkvam00axyg	2024-12-03T22:11:57-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/03/Skn0ayaXkg/Skn0ayaXkg_0_0_1024_576_0_small.jpg

Settlers burn Palestinian property after illegal structures demol...	Fires set to homes, cars, shop in Huwara and Beit Furik after civil administration takes down buildings erected on private Palestinian land; security forces injured in clashes with violent settlers Palestinians reported early on Wednesday, that settlers set fires to property in the West Bank towns of Huwara and Beit Furik, after the civil administration tore down structures built illegally by the settlers, on private Palestinian land near Nablus. According to reports, the settlers burned a store, cars and a home under construction in Beit Furik and three other buildings as well as three cars were set on fire in Huwara. No injuries were reported but the damage was extensive. The civil administration said the demolition of illegally constructed structures was in accordance to a decision of the defense forces and after repeated criminal acts originating in the illegal outpost, targeting Palestinians. In a statement the administration said the criminal activity had the potential of causing violet clashes in the area. The forces alerted the settlers in advance of the intention to dismantle one of the structures that was used as a religious seminary, out of respect for their religious sensibilities. Earlier the settlers clashed with security forces near the settlement of Itamar, injuring three Border Patrol troops. Analysis: The events were additional proof of the inability of security forces to enforce the law when acts of nationalistic crimes are committed. Even when culprits are arrested, in 90% of cases, they are not brought to justice. The violent settlers are well versed in avoiding prosecution, including destroying military surveillance equipment, refraining from the use of mobile devices, covering their faces with masks and refusing to cooperate with investigations. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Failing to enforce the law in such cases has landed Israel in trouble both in the West Bank and in the international arena including the judicial systems. Jewish terrorism destabilizes the West Bank adding to the risk of terrorism and causing injury to both Jewish settlers and Palestinians.

Israel, Philippines ties deepen, include arms sales, tourism agre...	Israel Shipyards recently delivered a Shaldag-class patrol boat to the Philippine Navy, marking a significant step in the growing ties between the two nations The relationship between Israel and the Philippines has been warming across various fronts, and on Tuesday a Shaldag 5-class patrol boat was delivered from Israel Shipyards to the Philippine Navy. This is a further step in an agreement signed between the shipyard and the Philippine government in 2020. The Shaldag, considered one of the fastest and most advanced patrol boats of its kind in the world was delivered to the Philippine fleet fully equipped with all operational systems. It is capable of speeds exceeding 40 knots (approximately 75 km/h), the boat has a range of up to 1,000 nautical miles. Its design allows it to navigate both deep and shallow waters, enabling it to approach almost any shoreline. The boat is powered by two powerful engines and a waterjet propulsion system that provides exceptional maneuverability. Alongside the agreement between Israel Shipyards and the Philippine government, the Israeli defense systems manufacturer Rafael signed a deal to supply weapons, control, and communication systems that will be installed on the boat. These include a 30mm Typhoon gun, a 0.5mm gun, and short-range missile systems. The boat can remain at sea for up to six days and can accommodate a crew of up to 14 soldiers and commanders, offering improved living conditions with an equipped kitchen, comfortable crew rooms, personal rooms for the commander and his deputy, and a briefing and rest area. As part of the deal, Israel Shipyards is also refurbishing and upgrading the Philippine Navy’s shipyard. Additionally, a large group of Philippine Navy technicians has been trained at the shipyard in Haifa, enabling them to maintain the Shaldag boats delivered to the customer. This knowledge transfer process has been highly valued by the Philippine Navy’s leadership. The project is expected to be completed by June 2025 with the delivery of the last boat to the Philippine Navy. Meanwhile, Tourism Minister Haim Katz, currently visiting Manila, signed a memorandum of understanding to strengthen cooperation between the two countries in international organizations, with a focus on marketing, aviation, innovation, and digitalization. During his visit, Katz is expected to address the annual conference of the Philippine Association of Travel Agents, meet with journalists, opinion leaders, church leaders, and the president of Philippine Airlines. He will also participate in an Israeli wine event in collaboration with Israeli wineries. Katz noted, 'Upon taking office, I noticed an increased flow from the Philippines, which has remained stable even during the war. The Philippines is a key country in Asia, and its people see Israel as a must-visit destination. We intend to make special efforts to further develop and strengthen tourism ties between our countries.' Philippine Tourism Secretary Christina Garcia Frasco added, 'The Philippines and Israel share a tradition of warm relations, common heritage, and faith, highlighted through cultural and tourism exchanges. We will focus on knowledge exchange in sustainable tourism and accessible tourism.' The Philippines ranks fifth for tourist arrivals in 2024, with around 40,000 citizens visiting Israel, primarily for religious reasons. The Israeli Tourism Ministry, through its local office in Manila, has conducted diverse marketing activities, including roadshows, seminars for agents, and collaborations with influencers and media outlets. The Christian Jubilee Year in 2025 is seen as a unique opportunity to attract Christian tourists to Israel. This event will be central to tourism activities in the Philippines next year. Israel and the Philippines have had a tourism agreement since 1987. The memorandum of understanding forms the basis for a new agreement that will soon be signed, expanding the areas of cooperation. Warming relations post-October 7 After October 7, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos expressed support for Israel, calling for the release of hostages, condemning terrorism, and reaffirming the deep friendship between the two nations. Although the Philippines is part of the Non-Aligned group of nations and usually votes against Israel at the UN, after October 7, it voted at least once in favor of Israel, which drew criticism from other member states of the bloc. In Israel, there are 28,000 Filipino workers, most of whom work in healthcare, with some in the hospitality industry. Despite the war, most have remained in Israel. 'They are loyal, feel safe, and are treated well by their employers. They feel at home and part of a family here. We hear this all the time,' said Israel’s Ambassador to the Philippines, Ilan Plots. 'The Philippine government greatly appreciates the treatment and conditions of Filipino workers in Israel.' In the past year, Israel has sent four economic and business delegations to the Philippines in areas such as agriculture, water, cybersecurity, and emergency preparedness. A week ago, the Israeli Embassy in Manila held a week-long event to promote Israeli innovation and technology, encouraging investments in Israeli startups. 'There are many opportunities here. The Philippine economy is experiencing significant growth, and the middle and upper classes are expanding. The whole world is increasing its marketing efforts, and Israel is also doing the same,' added Ambassador Plots. And if that’s not enough: The embassy in the Philippines inaugurated an interactive learning center named after the city of Bari at a public school in San Juan. The opening ceremony, attended by San Juan Mayor Francis Zamora in Metro Manila, included songs and dances prepared by the children for the ambassador, as well as a reading of the story of 'David and Goliath' in English and Filipino by the ambassador and the mayor. The children actively participated, asking the ambassador questions and learning about Israel. Mayor Zamora emphasized the strong connection between the two countries and expressed hope to visit Israel. Ambassador Plots highlighted the deep historical ties between the two nations, dating back to 1938 when President Manuel Quezon saved 1,300 Jews from the Nazis by granting them work visas to the Philippines. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The name 'Bari' reflects both the focus on the well of knowledge that the children will gain from the center and a remembrance of one of the kibbutzim severely impacted by last year’s events. This is the second of three projects where the embassy is contributing learning centers named after various cities in Israel. Last year, the Jerusalem Learning Center was inaugurated, and next week another center named after Ofakim will be opened. Additionally, Israel has helped Philippine schools open informal English learning centers and provided aid to areas affected by natural disasters. Currently, the embassy is working to convince Philippine Airlines to launch direct flights to Israel after the war, which could increase tourist exchanges between the two countries. In the past, the airline conditioned this on flying over Saudi Arabia, and it had received approval from the Saudis. However, the war has complicated those plans. On average, 14,000 Israelis visit the Philippines annually, with that number on the rise. Despite the war, Filipino tourists rank fifth in arrivals to Israel. Last year, without the war, it was expected to be a record year for Filipino tourists visiting Israel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1n8l02qjg	2024-12-03T20:30:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/03/rk711SwnXJe/rk711SwnXJe_0_134_1280_720_0_small.jpg
Syrian rebels advance close to Hama city, piling pressure on Assa...	Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi says Tehran would consider sending troops to Syria if Damascus asked, and Russian President Vladimir Putin urged an end to 'terrorist aggression' in Syria Syrian rebels advancing against government forces pushed close on Tuesday to the major city of Hama, rebels and a war monitor said, after their sudden capture of Aleppo last week rocked President Bashar al-Assad. Rebels and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said insurgents had captured villages including Maar Shahur a few miles north of the city. Syrian state media said reinforcements were arriving in the area. An attack on Hama would ramp up pressure on Assad, whose Russian and Iranian allies have scrambled to support him against a reviving rebellion. The city has remained in government hands since civil war erupted in 2011. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said in an Arabic-language interview that Tehran would consider sending troops to Syria if Damascus asked, and Russian President Vladimir Putin urged an end to 'terrorist aggression' in Syria, RIA reported. Iraq Prime Minister Shia al-Sudani said Baghdad would not be 'a mere spectator' in Syria and blamed Israeli military strikes on the Syrian government for the rebel advance, his office said. Compounding Assad's problems, fighters from a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition battled government forces in the northeast, both sides said, opening a new front along a vital supply route. Last week's rebel seizure of Aleppo - Syria's largest city before the war - marked the biggest offensive for years. The front lines of the conflict have been frozen since 2020 after Assad clawed back most of the country from rebels, thanks to help from Russian air power and military help from Iran and its network of regional Shi'ite militia groups. Now, however, Russia has been concentrating on the war in Ukraine, while Israeli strikes over the past three months have decimated the leadership of Hezbollah, the strongest Iran-backed force fighting in Syria. On Monday, hundreds of Iran-backed Iraqi militia fighters entered Syria to back up Syrian government forces, Iraqi and Syrian sources said, but Hezbollah does not plan to send forces now. A rebel source said Iran-backed militia fighters were among the forces they were battling outside Hama. In recent days, Russian and Syrian government warplanes have intensified airstrikes against rebels, both sides have said. Rescue workers have reported deadly strikes on hospitals in Aleppo and Idlib. Jockeying for territory Any sustained escalation in Syria risks further destabilizing a region already alight from wars in Gaza and Lebanon, where a truce between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group took effect last week. The retreat by Assad's forces over the past several days has led to jockeying for control among other groups that control pockets in the northwest, north and east. The Syrian Democratic Forces, an umbrella group which controls territory in Syria's east with U.S. support, said early on Tuesday that its Deir al-Zor Military Council had 'become responsible for protecting' seven villages previously held by the Syrian army. The Deir al-Zor Military Council comprises local Arab fighters under the SDF, an alliance mainly led by a Kurdish militia, the YPG. Syrian state media reported that the army and allied forces were repelling an SDF assault on the villages, the only Syrian government presence along the east bank of the Euphrates river, an area otherwise mostly held by the SDF. A Syrian military officer said the SDF push was aimed at exploiting government forces' weakness after the rebel advance, and said the army and allied Iran-backed militia groups were sending reinforcements. Airstrikes also targeted Iran-backed militia groups supporting Syrian government forces in the strategically vital region, a security source in eastern Syria and a Syrian army source said. The U.S. military, which has a small number of troops based at a gas field in the area, carried out at least one strike in self defense overnight, a U.S. official said, adding it was not related to the ongoing rebel advances. Crowded battlefield The battlefield is crowded in northern Syria, with the U.S., Russia, Iran and Turkey all involved in the renewed fighting, underscoring the messy global politics at play. On Monday, Iran said there would be a foreign ministers meeting with Turkey and Russia in Doha next weekend as part of a diplomatic process that had earlier been used to stabilise borders. The SDF was the main Western-backed ground force in eastern Syria fighting Islamic State, which ran a jihadist mini-state there from 2014-17. Turkey says the SDF's main fighting force, the YPG, are Kurdish separatists it regards as terrorists, and sent troops across the frontier in 2017 to push them back. Rebel advances in recent days have dislodged the YPG from areas in and near Aleppo, including Aleppo's Sheikh Maqsoud district and a corridor around Tel Refaat to the north. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The SDF presence in northeast Syria along much of the border with Iraq also complicates supply lines for Iran-backed regional militia groups supporting Assad. On Monday Reuters reported that hundreds of Iran-backed Iraqi fighters had crossed the border into Syria to help government forces. Israel has regularly struck Iran-backed forces in Syria. Hezbollah said an Israeli strike near Damascus on Tuesday killed one of its senior officers liaising with the Syrian military.

Victoria Coates: Palestinians lost battle with Israel – 'someone ...	Exclusive one-on-one interview with Trump’s former deputy national security advisor for the Middle East and North Africa The Palestinian-Israeli conflict ended decades ago with the country's founding and its victory in the 1967 Six-Day War, according to former U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Victoria Coates. Speaking to ILTV on Monday at the Misgav Institute for National Security & Zionist Strategy, she said the Palestinians were never told they lost. Instead, 'they were encouraged, particularly after the Iranian Revolution, to continue this self-defeating, suicidal, genocidal [behavior] we saw on October 7.' 'Someone has to have the nerve to say to the Palestinians, we are not negotiating a ceasefire, we're negotiating terms' to end the conflict, she added. Coates, an evangelical Christian and staunch supporter of the Jewish state has visited Israel many times. She has held several key political leadership roles, including serving in the Department of Energy, where she advised Secretary Dan Brouillette on national security issues and acted as his representative in the Middle East and North Africa. Today, she serves as Vice President of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at The Heritage Foundation. She recently published a book, The Battle for the Jewish State: How Israel—and America—Can Win, which focuses on October 7 and why America must stand with Israel. She said the possibilities for the Palestinians, if they were to disarm and accept defeat, are abundant. 'You could imagine what would flow into both the West Bank and Gaza, just the offers of assistance and the enthusiasm on the part of Israel,' Coates said. She added that some actions from the Trump administration, such as cutting funding, might help deliver this message. However, while Coates is deeply passionate about Israel, she said her book aims to address issues in her own country. 'Because this [Islamic extremism] isn't a Jewish or an Israel issue. This is a Western civilization issue,' she explained. 'They might be coming for Israel right now, but the United States is next, make no mistake about it,' Coates said. She highlighted the rapid decline in U.S.-Israel relations, contrasting former President Donald Trump's signing of the Abraham Accords in September 2020 with the situation following October 7. 'It took just three and a half years of the Biden-Harris administration to return to the Obama-era policies of embracing Iran, of trying to elevate the Palestinian people, to result in October 7,' she told ILTV. The Abraham Accords, signed by the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Israel, were a historic step toward normalization. Shortly afterward, Israel also established ties with Morocco and Sudan. Before October 7, Israel and Saudi Arabia also appeared close to normalizing relations. However, the tragedy of the massacre and the ongoing war have put any potential peace agreement on hold. Despite this, analysts and sources within Saudi and Israeli leadership circles suggest that talks are still ongoing. Saudi Arabia has maintained its stance that peace is contingent on a Palestinian state, while Israel's parliament has overwhelmingly voted against such a solution. Coates told ILTV she believes Trump would act decisively to expand the Abraham Accords, including securing a Saudi deal. Her book includes a foreword by one of her former bosses, Senator Ted Cruz, focusing on the rise of anti-Israel sentiment on U.S. college campuses. Coates said she reviewed curricula from top institutions, such as the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard, and found troubling themes. 'All of our great universities have these curricula that are peer-reviewed articles about how the International Criminal Court should declare Israel illegal, and then, by extension, the United States,' Coates said. 'And this is what we've just seen in recent months, with the arrest warrants for [former Defense Minister Yoav] Gallant and Prime Minister Netanyahu.' She called the arrest warrants 'absurd' and 'ridiculous' but added that they illustrate 'how far' the situation has deteriorated. Coates also addressed the concept of 'settler colonialism,' which originated in the 1960s, she said. The idea portrays the United States and Israel as inherently racist and imperialistic, regardless of their inclusive democracies or immigrant-driven societies. 'What kind of bullet did we dodge in the potential Harris-Walz administration, which was poised to be the most hostile in Israeli history?' Coates asked. 'I think people began realizing the kind of steps they were taking, how they were setting that up, how dangerous that could be down the road.' Trump will likely operate with an 'unabashedly pro-Israel stance' because he understands this approach is in America's best interest. 'I'm a Christian … but that's not why I am here and not why I wrote the book,' Coates emphasized. 'I wrote the book because the United States, we need Israel in the region, we need Israel locally, to be a partner and ally to us.' She highlighted Trump's nomination of former Governor Mike Huckabee as ambassador to Israel as an example of his pro-Israel policies and his understanding of the evangelical community that played a significant role in his election. 'You would assume that Israel would want a Jewish ambassador. But I think the enthusiasm for Governor Mike Huckabee is palpable,' Coates said. 'I think he can help bridge those two worlds and not make this a Jewish or Christian issue. This is an American issue. There are hundreds of millions of Americans who care deeply about Israel.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bknyrvaxjl	2024-12-03T16:57:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/04/r1BSL4pQke/r1BSL4pQke_0_320_2048_1153_0_small.jpg
At U.S. funeral, Omer Neutra's parents talk about shattered home,...	Hundreds gathered in New York as thousands came to Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, a day after the IDF's announcement of the fall on October 7 of lone soldier Omer Neutra; The parents of murdered hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin were there to support Omer's parents Hundreds of people gathered Tuesday in Long Island, New York, together with the parents and brother of Captain Omer Neutra, who the IDF announced on Monday was killed defending the border on October 7 . Thousands also gathered in Israel, demanding the return of the 101 hostages who are held captive by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, among them Neutra's body. Rachel and Jon Goldberg-Polin, the parents of Hersh, who was murdered while in Hamas captivity in Gaza, attended the memorial service for Omer Natura in Long Island in a show of support for the family. Omer's parents, Orna and Ronen, and his brother, Danny, entered the memorial service at the Long Island synagogue where Omer had once celebrated his bar mitzvah, accompanied by representatives of the IDF. Orna paid tribute to her son, saying that 'for a whole year of sleepless nights, I said 'I thank you' twice every morning - Once for me, and the other for you. For over a year now, we’ve been breathing life into your being, my beautiful boy. With the hope and love of so many, we kept going and going and going, keeping you alive, speaking your name from every outlet, pushing any hint of despair, not stopping to breathe or to take in the deep pain of your absence.' According to her, 'now things are clear, but not as we’d hoped. I have a big hole in my stomach, but we are not alone.' Omer's father, Ronen, added: 'How do you talk about your son, for whom you fought for more than 14 months - traveling to Israel, the U.S. and even Qatar - holding on to the hope that you will see him again, and then there is a knock on the door and you realize that you will never see him again?' The family of the fallen tank officer spoke of the need to release the hostages who are still being held by Hamas, including the body of their loved one. 'He chose to show his love for Israel in actions, not just in words, by joining the army,' emphasized brother Daniel. 'Now the time has come for Israel to show its love in return, by returning him and the others. We must continue his work and save lives. It is too late for him, but it was not in vain.' 'Still shocked' In Israel, thousands flocked to Hostages Square in Tel Aviv for the weekly 'Sing together for their return' evening, which was also attended by several members of Neutra's family, who were among the founders of the initiative that started last January and takes place every Monday in the square. They arrived immediately after watching the funeral ceremony held for Omer in the U.S. Gina and Shai Zohar, Omer's aunt and uncle, told Ynet upon arriving at the square that they were still shocked by the news. 'We were full of hope, and we acted out of a true desire that Omer would return to us and we would be reunited, that some miracle would happen to us,' shared his aunt. 'It's hard, and the distance is also hard. We're waiting for his parents to arrive in Israel, and that way we can at least comfort each other,' she added. Uncle Shai quoted Daniel, Omer's brother: 'He said that the thing that would most honor Omer's memory is for the state to bring back those he was killed to protect. This is what the State of Israel should do.' On Monday morning, Orna, Omer's mother and Shai's sister, called and informed them of the soldier's death. 'She called us at seven in the morning, and said she had bad news, that Omer was actually killed on the morning of Simchat Torah,' shared Shai. 'It ended more than a year of uncertainty. We knew that Omer was captured and that he was kidnapped alive, but we didn't know what happened to him. It is on the one hand very shocking, but on the other hand we know at least now that he did not suffer in captivity.' Omer's aunt noted that the news was difficult and filled her with pain, but at the same time there was a certain degree of relief. 'The worry was gnawing at me all the time,' she shared. 'There is some comfort. He really was a hero of Israel. The first to go out on the morning of Simchat Torah to protect the Gaza border settlements with his tank, and he and his team are heroes. Now we should pray with God's help that Omer and Oz Daniel will reach a proper burial in the land they fought for and loved so much, and that Nimrod will return to his family.' 'They fought until the end,' she continued. 'With all the unbearable pain, there is also a small comfort in knowing that Omer did not experience the cruel suffering of the long days in captivity. He fell as a hero, fighting until his last breath, with the values ​​that guided him all his life. The knowledge that he did not go through this torment - a small source of strength in the sea of ​​sadness.' The two were welcomed at Hostage Square in Tel Aviv with the support of the many present. They said that the last day was full of love and hugs from many Israelis. 'I think we learned a little more in the last year, how many people Omer was able to touch,' said Shai. 'He only came here after he finished high school, and he already had time to touch so many people. He will be missed by many.' Gina emphasized that, since October 7, 2023, she and the family have been privileged to 'see the beauty' that exists in Israel. 'I think this is what he would like to see for his people,' she said. Tamar Zohar, Neutra's grandmother, spoke at the rally about her kidnapped grandson. 'Who would have believed that we would stand here today and try to digest the bitter news that he is no longer alive,' she shared with the audience. 'Less than a month ago, we marked his second birthday in captivity. From childhood he was a happy child. He grew up in a community of former Israelis. When he finished high school he enrolled in university, but then decided to come to Israel for military preparatory school. 'This year he connected with his family and landscapes in Israel, and then told his parents that he wanted to enlist and defend the country. As the grandson of Holocaust survivors, he believed that it was his time to protect the Jewish people. On the Friday before the attack, he told his parents that they allowed him and his soldiers to lower alert. Until yesterday morning, we believed that our Omer was alive, and that we can bring him here soon and celebrate with him. Yesterday our hope was shattered and we have to fight to bring him to a grave in Israel. Omer, you continue to be a hero of Israel and of many others - now and in every moment, may your memory be blessed.' 'Eden and Omer could have stayed in America, but chose to enlist' Yael Alexander, the mother of the abducted soldier Edan Alexander, whom Hamas released a video of from captivity on Saturday , said that Omer and her son could have been living quietly in the U.S. 'Both could have stayed in America, but both chose to enlist in the IDF, and in October both were placed between Nirim and Nir Oz, Edan as a Golani soldier and Omar as a tank officer,' she shared. 'On the morning of October 7, Omer's force jumped with the tank to defend the settlements and was kidnapped after a heroic battle. My son was also kidnapped when he was left to defend the outpost.' 'Last Saturday we received a sign of life from Edan, just last week, and by a chilling coincidence, two days later, dear Ronen and Orana received the bitter news that their son was designated as a fallen soldier and that his body is being held in Gaza,' she added. 'I met Ronen and Orna under difficult circumstances,' she continued. 'They are amazing, supportive and loving parents. I learned from them what a prodigy Omer was. An athlete, smiling and sociable, who grew up to be a leading and inspiring leader. I am at a loss for words when I come to comfort them, because the sadness is great and unimaginable. I wish that he will soon return to the State of Israel and be buried there.'

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Trump at the Cabinet meeting that took place in Nahariya today, and said that 'It is a very strong statement which makes it clear that there is one party responsible for this situation — and that is Hamas. Hamas must release the hostages.'

Trump urges judge to dismiss hush money case due to election vict...	Donald Trump on Tuesday asked a New York state judge to dismiss the criminal case in which he was convicted in May of 34 felony counts involving hush money paid to a porn star in light of his victory in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election. Justice Juan Merchan last month delayed Trump's previously scheduled Nov. 26 sentencing indefinitely to give him the chance to seek dismissal. Trump's lawyers argue having the case loom over his four-year presidential term that begins on Jan. 20 would cause 'unconstitutional impediments' to the Republican businessman-turned-politician's ability to govern. Prosecutors with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office supported delaying the sentencing to give Trump the chance to make his case for dismissal, though they said they would oppose that bid. The prosecutors have until Dec. 9 to respond.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hydrag67kx	2024-12-03T12:53:03-08:00

Mediators in Israel-Lebanon cease-fire worry agreement won't hold	Amid concerns raised by Washington and Paris over actions that could jeopardize the implementation of the cease-fire agreement and violations by both sides, a French general is set to arrive in the region this week; He will join his American counterpart as the cease-fire enforcement mechanism becomes fully operational The United States and France have expressed concern over the fragile cease-fire agreement between Israel and Lebanon, warning both sides against actions that could jeopardize its implementation. 'We are only at the beginning,' they stressed in messages to both parties. The cease-fire enforcement mechanism is set to become fully operational on Thursday. U.S. General Jasper Jeffers has already arrived in Beirut and begun his work, holding meetings with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri. On Wednesday, a French general will join the enforcement team, marking the start of full operational activities. Additional civilian and military personnel from the U.S. and France are expected to join in the coming days. The Lebanese Army has also appointed its own general to participate in the mechanism. Commitment and preparedness A senior Israeli official noted that Washington has sought reassurances from Israel about its commitment to the cease-fire. 'The matter was raised during National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan's conversation with Minister Ron Dermer,' the official said. 'Both Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense Minister Katz affirmed Israel's commitment to the cease-fire.' However, he added, 'If violations persist, we are operationally prepared to respond decisively.' An international source familiar with the mechanism explained its functions: independent intelligence gathering, receiving and verifying specific reports from both sides, and facilitating consultations. 'The system is still taking shape, but it will find its rhythm in the coming days,' the source said. Messages have also been sent to Lebanese actors, including Hezbollah, emphasizing the importance of restraint. 'As mediators and guarantors of this agreement, we are doing everything possible to maintain balance and prevent its collapse,' the source added. Despite the cease-fire, violations continue. Hezbollah fired two mortar rounds at Mount Dov on Monday night, prompting the IDF to retaliate by eliminating terrorists and destroying 20 rocket launchers. The IDF also reported ongoing 'warning fire' against individuals and groups attempting to return to villages in southern Lebanon. During a visit to the northern border, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi reviewed the situation alongside senior commanders. 'The IDF remains firmly committed to the cease-fire,' Halevi stated, 'but our mission is to ensure this area does not revert to being a hub for terror infrastructure.' Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a stark warning to Lebanon, urging its government to empower the Lebanese Army to enforce its responsibilities under the agreement, including pushing Hezbollah beyond the Litani River and dismantling its infrastructure. 'If they fail and the agreement collapses, the reality will be clear—we will respond with overwhelming force,' Katz warned. In contrast, Lebanese Prime Minister Mikati accused Israel of cease-fire violations, omitting mention of Hezbollah’s mortar attacks. He emphasized the need to stabilize conditions for displaced residents to return and called for an expanded Lebanese Army presence in the south. Tactical gains and high-profile target eliminated This week, the IDF’s Alpine Brigade conducted targeted operations in the Mount Dov area, neutralizing all tunnels in the region as part of its defensive efforts. According to the IDF, troops uncovered, investigated and confiscated materials found in underground infrastructure linked to Hezbollah.

Jumaa, a long-serving Hezbollah operative, had held various roles, including head of intelligence in the Al-Khiam sector and head of operations at Hezbollah’s Damascus headquarters. In recent years, he acted as Hezbollah’s liaison with the Syrian military, coordinating weapons transfers critical to the organization’s operations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byb4uyp71l	2024-12-03T12:20:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/30/BJ5I50000XJg/BJ5I50000XJg_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

In a statement, Schumer, of New York, said he was honored to move the party forward 'during this crucial period for our country.' While Schumer remains popular with his colleagues, it is a bleak moment for Senate Democrats, who had been hopeful that they could hold the majority for the third election in a row.

South Korean president says he will lift martial law after lawmak...	Deployed military personnel are withdrawn and cabinet meeting set to formally lift martial imposed in surprise move by President Yoon Suk Yeol to eliminate 'anti-state' forces South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said early Wednesday in the country that he would soon lift the military rule he imposed overnight, after the parliament voted to reject his martial law declaration. Yoon said his government has withdrawn military personnel that had been deployed, and that he would formally lift martial law following a Cabinet meeting as 'soon as members arrive.' Yoon had declared martial law late Tuesday, vowing to eliminate'anti-state' forces as he struggles against an opposition that controls the country's parliament and that he accuses of sympathizing with communist North Korea. Less than three hours later, parliament voted to lift the declaration, with National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik declaring that the martial law was 'invalid' and that lawmakers 'will protect democracy with the people.' The South Korean army said that it will 'enforce the military rule in the country until it is removed by the president.' Meanwhile, Israel's Foreign Ministry published a travel recommendation for South Korea following the declaration of a military regime in the country, calling 'for all Israelis who plan to go there at this time, it is recommended to consider the necessity of visiting the country.' The ministry also said that 'it is still too early to assess what the consequences of the decision will be. We recommend that the Israelis in South Korea, for now and until things are clarified, stay in their homes or places where they are staying, and follow the updates in the media.' The president's surprising move harkened back to an era of authoritarian leaders that the country has not seen since the 1980s, and it was immediately denounced by the opposition and the leader of Yoon's own party. Police and military personnel were seen leaving the Assembly's grounds after Woo called for their withdrawal. Lee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal Democratic Party, which holds the majority in the 300-seat parliament, said the party's lawmakers will remain in the Assembly's main hall until Yoon formally lifts his order. 'Democratic Party lawmakers, including me and many others, will protect our country's democracy and future and public safety, lives and properties, with our own lives,' Lee told reporters. Jo Seung-lae, a Democratic lawmaker, claimed that security camera footage following Yoon's declaration showed that troops moved in a way that suggested they were trying to arrest Lee, Woo and even Han Dong-hoon, the leader of Yoon's People Power Party. Seemingly hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Assembly, waving banners and calling for Yoon's impeachment. Some protesters scuffled with troops ahead of the lawmakers' vote, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or major property damage. At least one window was broken as troops attempted to enter the Assembly building. One woman tried unsuccessfully to pull a rifle away from one of the soldiers, while shouting 'Aren't you embarrassed!' Under South Korea's constitution, the president can declare martial law during 'wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states' that require the use of military force to maintain peace and order. It was questionable whether South Korea is currently in such a state. When martial law is declared, 'special measures' can be employed to restrict the freedom of press, freedom of assembly and other rights, as well as the power of courts. The constitution also states that the president must oblige when the National Assembly demands the lifting of martial law with a majority vote. In Washington, the White House said the U.S. was 'seriously concerned' by the events in Seoul. A spokesperson for the National Security Council said President Joe Biden's administration was not notified in advance of the martial law announcement and was in contact with the South Korean government. The leader of Yoon's conservative People Power Party, Han Dong-hoon, called the decision to impose martial law 'wrong' and vowed to'stop it with the people.' Lee, who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, called Yoon's announcement 'illegal and unconstitutional.' Yoon said during a televised speech that martial law would help 'rebuild and protect' the country from 'falling into the depths of national ruin.' He said he would 'eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.'

Netanyahu's corruption trial testimony moved to Tel Aviv, starts ...	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s testimony in his corruption trial will begin on December 10 at the Tel Aviv District Court, following Shin Bet's security recommendations; Jerusalem court partially grants his request to delay proceedings, citing defense unpreparedness The testimony of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his ongoing corruption trial is scheduled to begin on December 10 at 9:00 a.m. The judges of the Jerusalem District Court have ruled that, following security recommendations, the proceedings will take place at the Tel Aviv District Court. The court also rejected Netanyahu’s request to appear before the judicial panel in advance to address procedural matters and security arrangements for his testimony. However, the judges have yet to establish the frequency of the hearings for his testimony. The court’s decision was rendered 'in light of the professional assessment provided by those responsible for the prime minister’s security, following a meeting during which explanations and clarifications were presented by these parties.' On Monday, the Shin Bet and the Courts Administration submitted their official position to the Jerusalem District Court regarding the appropriate venue for Netanyahu’s testimony. The Shin Bet argued that, due to heightened security risks, it should be held at the Tel Aviv District Court rather than the capital. 'After evaluating various threats based on relevant intelligence, including information received from the military, and following an analysis conducted by a protection consultant, the agency’s professional position is that, at this time, the hearings for the prime minister’s testimony should not be held at the Jerusalem District Court, even though a protected floor is available within the building,' the Shin Bet stated in its submission. The agency’s assessment also indicated that 'classified information of a ‘Top Secret’ nature concerning threats to the prime minister’s safety was presented during discussions between Shin Bet representatives and those of the Courts Administration, particularly in the context of challenges posed by the ongoing Gaza war. Various security measures were also reviewed by relevant authorities. Under these circumstances, the Courts Administration proposed several alternative venues for conducting the testimony, including court facilities within Jerusalem, such as the Regional Labor Court complex, and outside Jerusalem. However, only two locations – the Justice Hall in Bat Yam and the Justice Hall on Weizmann Street in Tel Aviv – were found to meet the stringent security requirements.' The statement further noted that the Shin Bet suggested 'an additional option: a non-court office building in Jerusalem that meets security criteria. However, upon review, it was determined that this location is incompatible with the unique format and procedural requirements of court proceedings. After considering all relevant factors, including site inspections and the findings of the protection consultant’s report, the Courts Administration recommended conducting the prime minister’s testimony in the underground, fortified courtroom at the Tel Aviv District Court, located in Justice Hall. This recommendation has been accepted by Shin Bet representatives.'

The court clarified that the Prime Minister’s most recent request to delay his testimony 'does not indicate a change in circumstances that would justify altering the scheduled date.' However, the court decided to partially accommodate the request. 'In light of the defense’s claim that it is unprepared to commence its case, coupled with the declaration that no further delays will be requested, and taking into account the undisputed need to advance the proceedings as expeditiously as possible, we have decided, albeit with reservations, to partially grant the request,' the court stated in its decision. In the second postponement request, first reported by Ynet, Netanyahu asserted: 'Despite every effort, the defense is not prepared and cannot be ready to commence the presentation of its case.' Netanyahu’s testimony, originally scheduled for December 2, had been postponed as a result of this request. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1inua37jx	2024-12-03T10:30:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/07/02/Hy5PadeJYh/Hy5PadeJYh_0_0_2399_1599_0_small.jpg

World Cup 2034 in Saudi Arabia unlikely to clash with Winter Game...	The 2034 soccer World Cup, which is expected to be held in Saudi Arabia and possibly in the cooler months, is unlikely to clash with the Salt Lake City winter Olympics, the International Olympic Committee said on Tuesday. Saudi Arabia is the lone bidder for 2034 World Cup with global soccer body FIFA to vote on it next week. FIFA has said the Saudi bid did not stipulate a proposed window for the World Cup but they would collaborate with stakeholders to 'determine the optimal timing' for the tournament given the country's hot climate. The IOC, however, has no concerns over a potential clash with the Salt Lake City winter Games to be held from Feb. 10-26, 2034. Due to the Saudi Arabia's desert climate, the 2034 World Cup is very likely to be pushed to a winter slot -- just as FIFA did with the 2022 edition in neighboring Qatar which held the event from late November to mid-December.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skzzcp2qyl	2024-12-03T09:30:28-08:00

The way to bring the hostages home': Israeli leaders praise Trum...	After US president-elect announced 'there will be ALL HELL TO PAY' if the hostages are not released, both government and opposition leaders praise his strong statement Israelis hope that the words of US President-elect Donald Trump - who stated that 'if the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East' – will advance the talks to renew the deal for the release of the 101 hostages held captive by Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The words of the new-old president have were posted on the Truth Social platform late Monday after his meeting with the prime minister's wife, Sara Netanyahu, at his Mar-a-Lago mansion in Florida. Trump's words have been welcomed throughout Israel, against the hope that they will advance the release of the 101 hostages who have been held captive by Hamas in the Gaza Strip for 424 days. Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Trump for his words at the cabinet meeting held on Tuesday in Nahariya in northern Israel. ''I want to thank President Trump for his strong statement yesterday. It is a very strong statement which makes it clear that there is one party responsible for this situation — and that is Hamas. Hamas must release the hostages.' 'The terrorist organization is required to release the hostages,' Netanyahu continued. 'President Trump put the emphasis in the right place — on Hamas, and not on the Israeli government, as is customary in some places. 'We will continue to do everything to release them, and whoever harms them will be killed. This is what President Trump also said yesterday, and it adds validity to this statement.' President Isaac Herzog also thanked his American counterpart. In a tweet he posted on his account on the X platform, he wrote in English: 'Thank you and bless you Mr. President-elect Trump. We all pray for the moment we see our sisters and brothers back home!' The chairman of the National Unity party, Benny Gantz, shared Trump's words on X, and also wrote in English: 'Straight and to the point, President-elect Trump. Bring them home now.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also praised Trump's words. 'Thank you very much, Mr. President. How refreshing it is to hear clear and morally sound statements that do not create a false equivalence or call for addressing 'both sides,' but rather clarify who are good and who are bad. This is the way to bring back the hostages: by increasing the pressure and the costs for Hamas and its supporters, and defeating them, rather than giving in to their absurd demands.' Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim attacked Netanyahu in light of Trump's remarks, and blamed the Israeli prime minister for the failure of the talks, according to the New York Times. 'At many times we were extremely close to signing on a deal, but due to his savage actions and decision, these deals broke down,' he said. Naim also claimed that Trump's words were aimed at Netanyahu and members of the Israeli government. 'Everybody is talking about the hostages who are being held so violently, inhumanely, and against the will of the entire World, in the Middle East - But it’s all talk, and no action!' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. Please let this TRUTH serve to represent that if the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity. Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!' Trump's statement followed the IDF's confirmation that Captain Omer Neutra, an Israeli American soldier believed to have been held hostage since the October 7, 2023, terrorist attack, was killed, with his body still held by Hamas. Trump's dramatic statement regarding the hostages also came the day after his meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's wife, Sara, and her, Yair, during which the issue of the hostages came up. Sources privy to the details stated that Sara and Yair Netanyahu were invited by Trump to the meeting, which took place at the international golf club he owns. According to the sources, the two were seated at a meal at a table that included 10 guests, including the president-elect, American senators and members of the incoming administration. According to the sources, the one who asked to be photographed in the photo published after the dinner was Trump himself. They stated that 'the meeting was very warm', and that 'Sara Netanyahu asked Trump to help with the issue of the hostages.' They claimed that 'her words left an impression on Trump, and he chose to publish the message the next day.' Trump, who will enter the White House on January 20, 2025, has spoken with Prime Minister Netanyahu five times since his election victory last month. In July, Trump praised his ties with the Israeli leader. 'We've always had a great relationship, it was never bad,' he told journalists after inquiring whether the two were on good terms after Trump voiced harsh criticism of Netanyahu for congratulating President Joe Biden for his election victory over Trump, which the Republican disputed. He then turned to Sara, calling her his 'secret weapon,' adding, 'As long as I have her support, that’s what matters.' Weeks before the U.S. election, Trump referred to his meetings with the Netanyahus, including a visit to Mar-a-Lago. 'He came to my home in Florida with his lovely wife,' Trump said. He added that Prime Minister Netanyahu is 'very strong' and 'does not listen to Biden.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In an Instagram post, Sara Netanyahu described the meeting, focusing on the aftermath of the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. 'I also brought to the President’s attention the immense suffering Israel endured on October 7th and the inhumanity of Hamas terrorists holding our citizens hostage under harsh conditions. I emphasized the urgent need to act for their release and swift return,' she wrote. 'We also discussed the strategic importance of Israel’s victory in the fight against the axis of evil, for a more stable and secure future in the Middle East and around the world.' Netanyahu is currently in Miami for a 20-day visit to spend time with Yair, who has lived abroad for much of the past two years. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj11xc2nm1e	2024-12-03T09:05:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/26/SJZ1eI11KC/SJZ1eI11KC_414_207_597_336_0_small.jpg

Sunni rebels advance deeper into Syria, Assad prepares for counte...	Syrian rebels, led by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, have captured key areas near Hama and Aleppo, exploiting Assad's weakened allies; As civilians flee, fears grow in Aleppo under rebel rule, with minorities wary despite promises of protection Nearly a week after launching a surprise offensive against Bashar al-Assad's army, Syrian rebels, spearheaded by Salafist organization Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, continue their gains, seizing four towns near Hama and advancing to within six miles of the city, the country’s fourth-largest. Assad's regime is fortifying defensive lines in preparation for a counterattack. Meanwhile, clashes have erupted on a new front in Deir ez-Zor province, where Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have launched an attack. The rebel offensive began on Wednesday, coinciding with a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Exploiting the weakened state of Assad’s allies – Hezbollah, pro-Iran militias, and a distracted Russia – the rebels captured large areas of Aleppo province, forcing Syrian forces to abandon their positions. For the first time since the war's onset, rebels have taken full control of Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city. Assad’s forces admitted they are 'reorganizing' and have received reinforcements from Iraqi militias. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Assad's forces regained one village, Khanaser, but the rebels are advancing south toward Hama. Four towns – Halfaya, Taybat al-Imam, Mardis, and Suran – have been captured, with rebels claiming to have killed 50 regime fighters in the process. A photographer from AFP witnessed dozens of abandoned tanks and military vehicles on the road to Hama. 'Violent clashes are taking place in northern Hama province,' reported the Observatory, adding that Syrian and Russian air forces are carrying out heavy bombardments. In Deir ez-Zor, Kurdish-led SDF forces, supported by the U.S., claimed to have seized seven villages near a U.S. military base. However, Syrian media denied their advance, and the Observatory confirmed no significant Kurdish gains. Pro-Iranian militias were accused of artillery fire that killed four civilians, including a child. Airstrikes also targeted Idlib, a rebel stronghold, killing three civilians in a hospital bombing. The EU condemned Russia’s actions, accusing it of targeting populated areas. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Fear and uncertainty loom over Aleppo, now under rebel control. 'We don’t know what will happen,' one resident told AFP, adding that rebel fighters 'haven’t harassed' them but have asked his daughters to wear veils. G eorge Manessian, an Armenian political commentator in contact with Aleppo Armenians, said jihadists from Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham have promised not to harm minorities. 'On the first day, one fighter knocked on the door of an Armenian neighbor and assured him they would respect Christians and Armenians,' he told the BBC. However, he warned against trusting such promises, citing past incidents where Islamist militias initially avoided harming minorities but later committed crimes against them. The Syrian civil war, which began in 2011 during the Arab Spring, has claimed over half a million lives and displaced millions. While fighting had diminished in recent years, this new offensive marks a major escalation, threatening Assad’s hold on key territories. Since the attack began, 514 people have been killed, including 92 civilians, and nearly 50,000 have been displaced, many of them children. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkrb1ohx1g	2024-12-03T08:02:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/03/SJ5ltdn7ke/SJ5ltdn7ke_0_58_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Cairo talks consider ousted Fatah leader Mohammed Dahlan’s role i...	Egypt is trying to broker an agreement in the long-standing conflict between rival Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, and bridge internal divisions within Fatah [Cairo] Seizing on Gaza’s worst crisis in years, Egypt is positioning itself as a regional power broker. Leaders in Egypt are using the chaos to reshape governance in the Gaza Strip and reinforce Egyptian influence amid rapidly shifting international dynamics. Talks in Cairo between rival Palestinian factions Fatah and Hamas have exposed deep complexities in reaching a consensus on Gaza’s future leadership. Parallel discussions explored internal reconciliation within Fatah, including the contentious role of Mohammed Dahlan, the ousted Fatah leader and head of Fatah’s Democratic Reform Faction. Central to the Cairo negotiations is a proposal for a technocratic civil administration in Gaza under the control of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and without the involvement of Hamas. Hamas leaders Khalil Al-Hayya, Husam Badran and Mousa Abu Marzook have proposed the creation of a 'community support committee' to manage crossings, police and security under PA oversight. Talks between the factions have stalled. Hamas claims it received no substantive response to its proposal. At the same time, Fatah sources say unresolved issues over Hamas-affiliated security forces are a major sticking point. A Fatah source told the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya news channel that PA President and Fatah Chair Mahmoud Abbas 'will reject any deal involving Hamas’ security forces as long as the hostage issue remains unresolved.' This impasse has delayed any formal agreement, deepening frustration among Gazans and raising questions about the feasibility of reconciliation between the two factions. Meanwhile, Dahlan has reemerged as a potential figure in Gaza’s reconstruction. Dahlan’s Democratic Reform Faction has distributed humanitarian aid in Gaza, bolstering the UAE-backed leader’s image as a pragmatic figure capable of delivering results where others have faltered. 'Dahlan’s Gulf connections give him access to resources that neither Hamas nor the PA can match,' Mkhaimar Abusada, a political science professor at Gaza’s Al-Azhar University, explained. Supporters view Dahlan’s UAE ties as an asset allowing him to bypass factional gridlock and focus on aid delivery. Critics, however, argue his aid delivery efforts are a calculated bid to position himself as a leader. 'Dahlan’s influence remains limited, especially in Gaza,' Khaled Okasha, general manager of the Egyptian Center for Strategic Studies, said. 'His role depends on whether Egypt, the UAE, and other stakeholders are willing to back him fully.' The Cairo talks also included discussions on internal reconciliation within Fatah, focusing on the reintegration of members aligned with Dahlan. Key figures such as Hussein al-Sheikh, Samir Masharawi, and Palestinian intelligence chief Majed Faraj participated in these discussions, facilitated by Egyptian intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Hassan Rashad. While Abbas has reportedly instructed participants to 'continue the rapprochement,' he has not decided to reinstate dismissed Fatah members. Gazans are disillusioned For Gazans, political deadlock among their leaders exacerbates the daily humanitarian crisis they are facing. Civilians, already struggling with severe food, water and shelter shortages, are desperate for governance that prioritizes their needs. 'Hamas’ tactical victories come at a catastrophic cost for ordinary Gazans,' Waseem Abu Mahadi, a journalist from north Gaza now sheltering in Cairo, explained. 'The people here are desperate for leadership that prioritizes their welfare over political power plays,' Abu Mahadi said. 'Instead, they are caught in a cycle of suffering imposed by decisions far from their homes.' Abu Mahadi noted that while leaders debate governance structures, most regular Gazans are focused on survival. 'Reconstruction, electricity and access to clean water are the issues people care about. Instead, they are paying the price for conflicts they didn’t start,' he said. On Monday, Egypt underscored its role in Gaza’s recovery by hosting a ministerial conference titled 'A Year of Humanitarian Catastrophe in Gaza: Urgent Needs and Sustainable Solutions.' The event brought together foreign ministers, United Nations officials, and representatives from international organizations to address Gaza’s dire humanitarian situation. Dahlan’s challenge is to prove he can rise above factional politics to deliver meaningful change UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed spoke at the conference as a representative of Secretary-General António Guterres. Mohammed called for predictable and sustained aid delivery, urging all parties to adhere to international law. 'Our focus must remain on the Palestinian people and alleviating their suffering,' she said. Egyptian officials highlighted their efforts to facilitate aid through the Rafah crossing, which has faced tighter Israeli restrictions. 'The international community must act decisively to address this crisis,' said Mahmoud Omar, a senior Egyptian diplomat to Palestine. Amid these humanitarian efforts, Egypt has proposed establishing an administrative committee to oversee reconstruction and governance in Gaza. This technocratic body would exclude figures from Hamas and the PA to avoid factional struggles for dominance. 'This proposal addresses long-standing grievances about Hamas’ governance while avoiding direct PA involvement, which many in Gaza oppose,' Okasha, the Egyptian Center for Strategic Studies general manager, said. Hamas, weakened but still influential, has engaged cautiously with the plan. For the group’s battered leadership, accepting a reduced role in governance represents a bitter compromise, but one necessary for ensuring stability and aid delivery. Meanwhile, Dahlan’s challenge is to prove he can rise above factional politics to deliver meaningful change. 'Dahlan’s ability to channel aid and build alliances is significant,' Abusada, the political scientist, said. 'But his reliance on external actors like the UAE could undermine his credibility among Palestinians.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Abu Mahadi cautioned that current talks offer hope but fail to address the root causes of Gaza’s suffering. 'Without real political change and genuine leadership, Gaza will remain stuck in a cycle of destruction and reconstruction,' the journalist said. Gaza’s future will ultimately depend on balancing local support, regional cooperation, international engagement, and Israeli intentions. 'The people deserve leadership that prioritizes peace, development, and stability – values that have been missing for far too long,' Abu Mahadi said.

IDF to draft comprehensive plan to ease restrictions for lone res...	Lawmaker criticizes Defense Ministry's financial support for nonprofits assisting lone soldiers, calling it 'a disgracefully minimal and insulting amount'; New guidelines are set to take effect in January 2025; Issue is urgency as population of lone reservists grows amid ongoing war The IDF is developing new criteria to define and support lone reservists which is expected to take effect in January 2025 after final approval, according to a report on Tuesday. The Knesset's Committee for Immigration, Absorption and Diaspora Affairs, chaired by lawmaker Oded Forer, met Monday to continue deliberations and will reconvene Wednesday to track progress. The issue is gaining urgency as the population of lone reservists grows amid the ongoing war and the challenges faced by Jews globally. Following the initial report, numerous mental health professionals volunteered their services for free to assist reservists. During Monday’s committee meeting, Levy Prager, a lone reservist from the Netherlands, shared his experience. 'I left my parents behind without knowing if I'd ever see them again. I've served 250 reserve days, and as a lone soldier I have no family in Israel to support me,' he said. After a breakup with his partner, he also lost the support of her family. 'Some of my fellow lone reservists move from one couch to another because they have nowhere to go.' The tragic story of Santiago Ovadia González, a Nahal Brigade fighter from Venezuela, was also raised. 'Before the war, Santiago was a happy person,' said his brother, Sebastian. 'Nine months of fighting in Gaza changed him. He returned to an empty apartment with no support to cope with his severe mental distress. We are asking for a change in the law to recognize soldiers who die from mental health struggles as fallen soldiers.' Sobering data According to the IDF, approximately 13,000 lone reservists have served since the war began. Of these, 8,300 are single, 2,401 are married, and 157 are divorced (58 with children and 99 without). Seventeen lone soldiers have died in the current conflict, including 11 active-duty troops, six reservists, four lone police officers, and one civilian guard. Maj. Noa Ohayon, head of the IDF's Reserve Personnel Department, presented plans to provide greater support. 'In November, we began developing a framework to identify lone reservists. Under the draft plan, a reservist with properties in both Israel and abroad can receive full reimbursement for the less expensive property. We’re also introducing financial assistance, expedited review through special committees, and a dedicated day for handling personal errands,' he explained. Struggles of nonprofits Zvika Graeber, founder and chair of KeepOlim in Israel, detailed the challenges faced by nonprofits supporting lone soldiers. 'We’re doing the impossible to help these soldiers, but we struggle to gain budgetary support from the Defense Ministry. Too many lone reservists fall into despair during their leave and harm themselves,' he said. Economic challenges compound the crisis. Government support for nonprofits assisting lone soldiers is minimal, with the Defense Ministry contributing just 300,000 shekels and the Immigration Ministry only 144,000 shekels. 'The bureaucratic hassle of applying for funding isn’t worth the effort,' said Shifra Shachar, CEO of A Warm Home for Every Soldier. 'The funds we receive don’t justify the struggle.' Eyal Hans, head of the Defense Ministry’s Department for Discharged Soldiers, explained that funding is based on nonprofit spending and the number of soldiers they assist. Immigration Ministry representative Irena Reuvani promised a broader and more accessible funding framework by 2025. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Forer stressed the urgency of addressing the issue. 'The mental and financial struggles of reservists, particularly new immigrants, begin the moment they are discharged. Nonprofits respond faster than the government, but between 3 million and 10 million shekels must be allocated to lone reservists immediately. This must be a priority, and the benefits should be automatic – not something they have to fight for.' He also criticized the Defense Ministry’s current funding. 'The pitiful amount allocated to nonprofits is disgraceful,' he said. 'They might as well admit they don’t support them at all.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjbikqhx1l	2024-12-03T06:41:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/03/S14Tn3d3Q1x/S14Tn3d3Q1x_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu says Lebanon cease-fire does not mean war is over	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that Israel was committed to its cease-fire deal with Hezbollah, but warned that it did not mean the war was over. Speaking at the start of a cabinet meeting in the northern border city of Nahariya, Netanyahu said Hezbollah had seriously violated the accord on Monday and that Israel had subsequently attacked more than 20 targets across Lebanon in retaliation. 'We are currently in a cease-fire, I note, a cease-fire, not the end of the war,' he said. 'We have a clear goal to return the residents, to rehabilitate the north. We are enforcing this ceasefire with an iron fist, acting against any violation, minor or serious.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byu2ei2mjl	2024-12-03T06:33:37-08:00

Israeli strike near Damascus killed Hezbollah liaison with Syrian...	An Israeli airstrike on a car near Syria's capital Damascus on Tuesday killed Salman Jumaa, a senior Hezbollah figure responsible for liaising with the Syrian army, a Lebanese security source told Reuters. Syria's state news agency had reported the strike on the airport road but did not offer details on casualties. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel rarely acknowledges its strikes in Syria, where it has carried out a years-long air campaign against Iranian military assets and those of its allies, including Hezbollah. In a rare announcement last month, it said it struck Hezbollah intelligence assets near Damascus. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that he was 'playing with fire' by allowing Iran to transfer weapons to its allies via Syria.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj2h4jh71g	2024-12-03T06:31:53-08:00	
Lebanese refugees return home from Iraq as Israel-Hezbollah cease...	Lebanese families displaced in Iraq by the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah have begun returning to their homes in southern Lebanon following a recently brokered cease-fire. The cessation of hostilities has allowed many to make the journey back, despite widespread destruction. More than 20,000 Lebanese have sought refuge in Iraq since the outbreak of the war, according to official figures seen by Reuters. Najaf airport officials said around 800 Lebanese were leaving for Beirut every week, while others were using government-provided buses to travel to the Qaim border crossing with Syria and then on to Lebanon. Iraqi local officials said at least 1,000 Lebanese had been crossing into Syria daily for three days. But then an escalation of hostilities in Syria following a rebel offensive against Syrian government forces led many to shun the land route, fearing for their safety. They now prefer to wait for flights.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjwb4oh7jl	2024-12-03T06:31:02-08:00	
South Korean president declares martial law	Yoon Suk Yeol made the announcement in a televised briefing, vowing to 'eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order' South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared the imposition of 'emergency martial law' on Tuesday, accusing the country’s opposition of controlling the parliament, sympathizing with North Korea and paralyzing the government with anti-state activities. Yoon made the announcement in a televised briefing, vowing to 'eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.' It wasn’t immediately clear how Yoon’s step would affect the country’s governance and democracy. The move drew immediate opposition from politicians, including the leader of his own conservative party, Han Dong-hoon, who called the decision 'wrong' and vowed to 'stop it with the people.' Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, called Yoon’s announcement 'illegal and unconstitutional.' 'Through this martial law, I will rebuild and protect the free Republic of Korea, which is falling into the depths of national ruin,' Yoon said during a televised speech, invoking South Korea’s formal name. 'I will eliminate anti-state forces as quickly as possible and normalize the country,' he said, while asking the people to believe in him and tolerate 'some inconveniences.' Yoon – whose approval rating has dipped in recent months – has struggled to push his agenda against an opposition-controlled parliament since taking office in 2022. Yoon’s conservative People Power Party had been locked in an impasse with the liberal opposition Democratic Party over next year’s budget bill. The opposition has also been attempting to pass motions to impeach three top prosecutors, including the chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, in what the conservatives have called a vendetta against their criminal investigations on Lee, who has been seen as the favorite for the next presidential election in 2027 in opinion polls.

NATO chief avoids talk of Ukraine's membership, says priority is ...	NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on Tuesday sidestepped questions about Ukraine's possible membership in the military alliance, saying that the priority now must be to strengthen the country's hand in any future peace talks with Russia by sending it more weapons. Rutte's remarks, ahead of a meeting of NATO foreign ministers, came days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that extending alliance membership to territory now under Kyiv's control could end 'the hot stage' of the almost 3-year war in Ukraine, where Russian forces are pressing deeper into their western neighbor. 'The front is not moving eastwards. It is slowly moving westwards,' Rutte said. 'So we have to make sure that Ukraine gets into a position of strength, and then it should be for the Ukrainian government to decide on the next steps, in terms of opening peace talks and how to conduct them.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjrk8c2mkl	2024-12-03T05:36:26-08:00

IDF operates, eliminates terrorists on four fronts	Israel's military targets Hezbollah operative in Syria, terror cell in the West Bank, continues operation in Gaza and enforces cease-fire with Lebanon 'with maximum force and zero tolerance' Amid American and French claims of Israeli violations of the cease-fire agreement in Lebanon, Defense Minister Israel Katz visited the northern border on Tuesday and warned that Israel stands ready to continue to operate there. 'If the cease-fire collapses, Lebanon will no longer enjoy immunity,' he said. 'We’ll enforce the cease-fire agreement with maximum force and zero tolerance. We’ve separated Lebanon from Hezbollah until now but that will no longer be the case,' Katz stressed. Meanwhile, the IDF continued its multi-front operations, carrying out strikes in Syria, southern Lebanon, the Beqaa Valley and the Gaza Strip on Tuesday. Lebanon: Warning strikes and border threats During his visit to the northern border, Katz received an operational overview of the area. 'Our policy, alongside the IDF, is clear and unequivocal – we will act with full force to enforce every understanding of the cease-fire agreement,' the defense minister said. Addressing Monday’s incident of Hezbollah firing on Mount Dov, Katz added: 'That was the first test. We responded forcefully and we will continue to do so, not allowing Hezbollah to revert to its old methods.' The U.S. has exerted heavy pressure on Israel to moderate its response to the mortar fire, which followed Israeli strikes, urging restraint and avoiding disproportionate actions or attacks in Beirut. The White House has also called on Lebanon to refrain from retaliating against Israeli responses. Katz sent a clear message to the Lebanese government. 'They need to authorize the Lebanese Army to enforce their side of the agreement, push Hezbollah north of the Litani River and dismantle all terror infrastructure,' he said. 'Every piece of infrastructure – terror-related, weapons and others – must be dismantled and must be done under U.S. supervision,' Katz asserted. 'If they fail to act and the agreement collapses, the scenario is very clear,' he warned. 'Should war resume, we’ll act with greater force and penetrate deeper.' The IDF continued its warning strikes in Lebanon, described as an 'enforcement of the cease-fire' by Israel but referred to as 'violations' by France and the U.S. on Tuesday, Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese channel Al-Manar reported that an Israeli drone attacked a site in southern Lebanon’s Beit Lif, with additional strikes in Deir Siryan later in the day. Since the cease-fire took effect, the IDF has mainly fired for the sake of deterring, frequently targeting residents and activists attempting to return to southern Lebanese villages. The military has also been active in Syria, Gaza and the Beqaa Valley. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said on Tuesday that 'talks are ongoing and intensified on Monday, to halt Israeli violations. We stressed the need to stabilize conditions to enable the return of displaced residents and to expand the Lebanese Army's deployment in the south.' Syria: Hezbollah commander eliminated In Syria, opposition-affiliated news site Voice of the Capital reported that an Israeli drone struck a vehicle on the road leading to Damascus Airport. Syrian radio station Sham FM later confirmed one fatality in the strike and reported damages. According to Arab media, the Israeli Air Force carried out a targeted killing of a Hezbollah commander on Syrian soil. While the figure wasn’t a senior official, the strike is considered unusual since the cease-fire began. The full results of the attack remain unclear. The West Bank: Forces foil terror cell planning attack In the West Bank, an Israeli Air Force drone twice struck a terrorist cell at the entrance to Al 'Aqaba, near Tubas in the West Bank, which was planning to execute an attack. The Palestinian Health Ministry reported two fatalities, with a third terrorist moderately injured before being evacuated to a local hospital. Later, Palestinian reports and footage showed a significant number of IDF forces entering the hospital complex and arresting several individuals. Palestinians also reported gunfire clashes at the site. The West Bank hospital director-general alleged that Israeli forces detained five medical staff members during the raid and attempted to 'seize' the bodies of those killed in the strikes.

One year after October 7, half of Israeli women fear sexual assau...	Israeli conference focusing on sexual trauma and treatment for former hostages presents worrying data following Hamas' atrocities on October 7 Warning: The article contains graphic depictions. Discretion advised. 'This is a state of war whose tactics include brutal rape and particularly cruel sexual violence and even more horrifying—it's not over yet. There's a strong sense that October 7 left us without tools,' former MK and opposition leader Shelly Yachimovich said at the opening of the conference organized by the Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel (ARCCI). Titled 'Trauma, Recovery, Justice?,' the conference focused on the complex issues surrounding the sexual violence of October 7 and the war along with its impact on victims and Israeli society as a whole. A survey by the Geocartography Knowledge Group, commissioned by the ARCCI and unveiled at the conference, found that 55% of women reported heightened fears of sexual assault since October 7. Additionally, men and women alike voiced significant concerns over their children’s safety. The survey showed that 78% of respondents were psychologically affected by reports of wartime sexual violence, with common reactions including anxiety, stress, intrusive thoughts and nightmares. Women and individuals with prior sexual trauma experienced these emotions more deeply. Furthermore, 68% of women reported significant changes in daily behavior, such as altered behavior in public, avoiding certain places, stricter home security and seeking psychological support. Marking one year since the war's outbreak, leading experts gathered for a series of discussions and lectures, examining the war's profound societal impact and exploring strategies for recovery and justice. 'Sexual violence is a true societal epidemic that has gained more public recognition over the past decade,' said ARCCI Executive Director Orit Sulitzeanu. 'But as an organization, we never imagined we'd have to create new knowledge and face such a horrific tragedy involving the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war. In the first days after the massacre, we received firsthand reports, eventually compiling the world’s first report on the sexual violence practices in all combat zones.' Tali Biner, a survivor of the Nova music festival massacre, operating room nurse and activist for justice for terror and sexual violence victims, shared at the conference: 'After hours hiding in a caravan, I started hearing screams—minutes that felt like hours, ending in a spray of gunfire. 'The screams tore through the sky and ripped the soul to pieces. I wasn’t afraid to die—I was afraid to be raped. When I left the caravan, the sounds I heard took on a visual form: dead women with legs spread, torn shirts, men with twigs and branches shoved into their genitals. I can’t imagine what’s happening to the women and men still there—young women seen as nothing more than objects, not human beings.' The ARCCI reported that October 7 shook its clientele profoundly. According to Sulitzeanu, there was an initial drop in calls during the war, as many felt their personal struggles were overshadowed by the broader national tragedy. In this 'new hierarchy of harm,' however, the cases that did surface were more severe and complex than before. 'The commitment of crisis centers is to place the callers at the top of our priorities,' Sulitzeanu affirmed. Keren Eini, director of the Ta'ir Rape Crisis Center, said, 'A sense of insecurity began even before the war. We’ve seen a 40% increase in calls since January 2023, but the war has significantly amplified this.' According to her, 'The depleted resources of the welfare and care systems are worsening the victims’ condition.' Another critical issue raised at the conference was how victims are sometimes turned into tools for advocacy purposes, leading to further harm. Dr. Tzvia Zeligman, clinical psychologist and director of the Lotem Center for Sexual Trauma Treatment at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, said, 'The repeated intrusion and turning victims into a form of reality TV are harmful and dangerous. 'As professionals, we need to take a stand on this. It’s a mistake to think someone who’s been sexually assaulted can testify through a simple question or interview. Processing and recounting such horrors can take years.' The conference also featured a lecture by Glenn Cohen, a clinical psychologist specializing in captivity and former head of psychology at the Mossad. Cohen led the team that debriefed the 117 hostages released from Gaza. 'We decided to create a protocol for those returning from captivity that first and foremost sees the individual,' he said. 'We prepared the team—who would approach whom, how to do it. We ensured women met with women and avoided any touch without consent. In the tension between critical security information and the returnees’ mental state, we prioritized family reunions and medical care before conducting interviews with a small team that included a psychologist.' 'These sessions focused on empowering the returnees and explaining that their information was crucial for saving lives. They were given control and could stop at any time.' Cohen calls this approach 'humanitarian intelligence'—'sensitive intelligence gathering handled with utmost care.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The ARCCI’s survey also revealed that 93% of the Israeli public believes the hostages face a risk of sexual violence and 73% think this should influence negotiations for a hostage deal. 'These findings represent a clear social mandate,' said survey authors Dr. Carmit Klar-Halamish and Noga Berger. 'We’re here to talk about recovery and justice. But the foundation for recovery from trauma is that it’s no longer ongoing—that one can look at it from the outside. In this case, the trauma is still happening. The Israeli public wants to close this chapter and that will only happen when everyone is brought home.' In collaboration with the Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel (ARCCI). >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1yyoihx1l	2024-12-03T04:07:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/30/yk14167525/yk14167525_1_0_436_245_0_small.jpg

It may take another week or another month, but Jabaliya will fal...	Led by Col. Liron Batito, the Givati Brigade focuses on eliminating Hamas terrorists in northern Gaza with a strategy of rapid raids combined with cautious, deliberate advances; despite killing and capturing over 2,000 terrorists, he says 'there’s still plenty to do' As we talk, the operations officer hands the radio earpiece to Col. Liron Batito, commander of the Givati Brigade. We’re seated in the brigade’s command center, housed in an abandoned building deep in the heart of Jabaliya. On the walls, screens display real-time updates of troop positions, enemy movements and live feeds from surveillance systems. 'A Tzabar detachment identified two terrorists approaching, likely with an anti-tank weapon,' Batito says calmly. 'The battalion commander is already handling it,' he adds. The Givati Brigade has been fighting for over a year now, beginning on October 7. On that grim Saturday, Col. Batito rushed from his home and fought alongside troops he managed to gather, first in Sderot and then in Kfar Aza. Apart from a single week of rotation, the brigade has remained in Gaza. Now in Jabaliya, their mission is to dismantle a massive Hamas network that reemerged after IDF forces cleared the area early in the war. 'Now the terrorists are waging urban guerrilla warfare against us, mostly in small groups of two or three,' explains Batito. 'But when we entered here, there were thousands. We’ve eliminated 1,000 and captured another 1,000, but a few hundred remain. Most are fanatics, Islamist jihadists. Some actively participated in the October 7 massacre and atrocities. They won’t surrender because they fear what we’ll do to them if they’re captured.' Each Hamas cell operates within its own geographic area of responsibility, equipped with dozens of explosive devices and RPG launchers, according to Givati fighters. While they have inflicted casualties on IDF forces, Givati commanders have recently observed that Hamas operatives are facing a growing shortage of ammunition. Preventing Hamas from rebuilding The IDF is conducting a series of raids targeting enemy sites identified through intelligence provided by Shin Bet and Military Intelligence (Aman). These targets often include schools where women, children and the elderly have taken shelter, with terrorists attempting to hide among them. Givati Brigade troops, typically transported in armored personnel carriers and supported by tanks, swiftly encircle such locations in under an hour. Once surrounded, the terrorists, realizing their situation, try to flee. The soldiers make extensive use of various drones, including loudspeaker drones used to direct non-combatant civilians on how to evacuate safely. The drones also track fleeing terrorists, dropping explosives on them or guiding troops through the alleys in pursuit. On the ground, speaking with commanders and soldiers, it becomes evident that claims of 'ethnic cleansing' in northern Gaza, such as those made by former defense minister and IDF chief of staff Moshe Ya’alon, hold no merit. The operations are strictly tactical, serving a dual purpose: applying pressure on Hamas, particularly regarding hostages, and preventing further regrouping or rebuilding efforts by Hamas in northern Gaza, roughly four kilometers from Kibbutz Netiv HaAsara and the city of Sderot. Most of the roads currently being built by the IDF in Gaza are designed to facilitate rapid logistical and operational movement deep into the territory. Quick mobility makes it harder for terrorists to target Israeli forces. While corridors like Netzarim and Philadelphi may carry strategic—and potentially political—significance, the majority of new roads are purely functional, ensuring secure movement through Gaza’s terrain, including its muddy winter conditions and for potential post-war operations. As of now, there are no visible signs in Gaza of plans to implement calls from some coalition members to reestablish Israeli settlements in the territory. While some in the field believe the IDF should remain in Gaza to prevent Hamas from rebuilding, there is little enthusiasm for resettlement. Meanwhile, the IDF is already operating in what commanders describe as the 'third phase' of combat: swift raids by small detachments targeting terrorists identified through intelligence and eliminating those attempting to approach Israeli forces. I joined Lt. Col. Matan Elgraby, commander of the Tzabar Battalion, in a Namer armored personnel carrier. On October 7, Elgraby was shot in the stomach while fighting terrorists in Kibbutz Kfar Aza but returned to his unit and has been continuously engaged in combat since summer. As we travel down a narrow alley, every pile of rubble evokes memories. 'Here, just last week, I lost a dear soldier, Ron Epshtein from Nesher, and here one of my company commanders was wounded,' he says. The Givati Brigade has lost 71 soldiers in this war, with the Tzabar Battalion alone mourning 17 fallen fighters and many others wounded. Soldiers first We stop about 100 meters behind the battalion’s forward unit, which had encountered militants while I was speaking with the brigade commander. Battalion commander Lt. Col. Matan Elgrabi fires a burst from a machine gun mounted on the Namer at suspicious movement. 'We’ll eliminate them shortly with an airstrike,' he says. We stop a couple hundred feet behind the battalion’s forward unit, which had encountered terrorists while I was speaking with the brigade commander. Battalion commander Lt. Col. Elgraby fires a burst from a machine gun mounted on the Namer at suspicious movement. 'We’ll eliminate them shortly with a combat strike,' he says. A 'combat strike' means that an Air Force fighter jet would deliver precision munitions to destroy the building housing the terrorists. 'Why risk soldiers when one bomb can achieve the goal?' Elgraby remarks. This tight coordination between branches and units is one of the most effective and innovative aspects of this war, significantly enhancing the safety of Israeli forces. Not far behind us is the evacuation Namer. Paramedic Yariv, from Tel Aviv, shares how his team’s experience during the war has led to rapid medical evacuations, now bringing wounded soldiers to the border or airlifting them within 30 minutes, and to hospitals within an hour. Speed is crucial to saving lives, but equally vital are the fresh blood transfusions Yariv administers to critically wounded soldiers within minutes of their injury. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sitting with Yariv, a young man in his 20s, it’s hard not to admire his composure and confidence despite dealing with severe injuries. When I ask him, 'Do you feel mental exhaustion?' he replies, 'Of course, but we push through. We’re sensitive to it and intervene when we see signs in others. It happens often.' Elgraby explains that initial care for soldiers showing signs of mental fatigue is handled by their commanders. Many troops draw strength from the horrors they witnessed on October 7. 'Anyone who saw what we did that day won’t forget and will fight to the end to ensure it never happens again,' Elgarby says. Another key source of resilience is the emotional support soldiers provide one another through camaraderie, commitment and deep bonds with their comrades in the company, battalion and brigade. When asked what he prioritizes most besides completing the mission, Brigade commander Batito responds without hesitation: 'The safety of my forces. I move slowly and act cautiously to minimize casualties among my men. The public should understand the fighting is slow because we are uprooting terrorist cells in an urban area, much of which had been leveled, where terrorists move stealthily from house to house. It may take another week or another month, but Jabaliya will fall.' 'And what comes next?' I ask. 'Gaza City?' Batito pauses for a second. 'There are many terrorists in Gaza City,' he replies carefully. 'And a brigade commander, Saad Haddad, who is organizing them. There’s plenty to do there.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjkyulnxyg	2024-12-03T01:41:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/02/yk14172747/yk14172747_0_68_749_422_0_small.jpg

Aleppo and Idlib under opposition control, with eyes on Hama	The opposition’s victories follow fierce battles with regime forces and Iranian-backed militias, reshaping control in northern Syria Syrian opposition factions have seized full control of the city of Aleppo and the entire Idlib province, key territories in northern Syria, following intense battles with regime forces and Iranian-backed militias. Both provinces are under aerial bombardments from Syrian regime warplanes and sporadic Russian airstrikes. The Military Operations Directorate of the opposition announced it has also captured parts of Hama province and claimed that hundreds of regime combatants, including Iranian fighters, were killed or captured in recent operations. Aleppo International Airport, along with five other military airports, has also fallen under opposition control. These include Menagh, Taftanaz, Abu al-Duhur, Al-Nayrab and Kuweires airports. The Media Line has received exclusive photos and videos showing Iranian flags in bases in the southern Idlib countryside and Aleppo, alongside trenches and tunnels constructed by Iranian militias. A military source from Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, a prominent opposition group, said that Aleppo is now devoid of regime forces and Iranian militias. The source, who requested anonymity, confirmed that the opposition has secured several towns, including Saraqib, Kafr Nabl, Maarat al-Numan, and Khan Shaykhun, and all villages across Idlib province that were under regime control. Meanwhile, the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army has launched an offensive against Kurdish forces in Aleppo’s countryside, capturing the strategic city of Tel Rifaat. Christians in Aleppo The fate of Aleppo’s Christian community, which has significantly diminished since the start of the Syrian war in 2011, has drawn international concern. Approximately 20,000 Christians remain in the city, a fraction of the prewar population. Contrary to Syrian regime media claims, local Christian leaders report that opposition factions, including Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, have allowed Christians to freely practice their faith. The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Aleppo confirmed that a Sunday mass was held to pray for peace in Syria and the world. Syrian writer and politician Ayman Abdel Nour, speaking from Washington, stated that opposition factions have assured Aleppo’s Christians they can continue religious activities without fear. Abdel Nour said that he had contacted Christians in Aleppo and confirmed that preparations for Christmas celebrations were ongoing and that all churches remained open for prayers. He also noted that opposition factions were actively protecting churches to prevent provocations by regime remnants or airstrikes. Despite these assurances, churches remain targets. On Sunday, a Russian airstrike hit the Franciscan Holy Land School in Aleppo, causing significant damage. Italy’s Foreign Ministry condemned the attack, calling for respect for places of worship. The Media Line obtained exclusive images of flames engulfing the school after the strike. Return to normalcy Since the opposition assumed control, Aleppo residents have reported improvements in daily life. Bread and fuel are being transported from Idlib to Aleppo, with local organizations coordinating distribution. Syrian Civil Defense teams, also known as the White Helmets, have deployed to the city, while opposition forces protect banks, institutions, and other key facilities. Residents interviewed by The Media Line confirmed that opposition forces have not harmed civilians, instead providing reassurances about their safety, provided they follow the guidelines of the new controlling authorities. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Despite these developments, the Syrian regime continues to target residential areas in Idlib and Aleppo with airstrikes, causing dozens of casualties. Meanwhile, opposition factions advance toward Hama in central Syria. An opposition field commander stated that battles in Hama are intense compared to what transpired in Idlib and Aleppo, where opposition forces reached their targets without significant resistance, as regime forces withdrew ahead of their advance. New power dynamics in Syria Political analysts view these developments as reshaping Syria’s control map. Opposition-aligned Syrian political analysts believe the US supports these dynamics, viewing it as a way to counter Iranian-backed militias and solidify its Kurdish allies’ position in northern Syria. By preventing Iraqi intervention to support Iranian militias, the US has effectively given the opposition the green light to advance, said Wael Al-Khalidi, a Syrian political analyst. He emphasized that Aleppo, once a stronghold for Iranian-backed forces, has now been wrested from their control. As opposition forces press their advance into Hama, the future of Syria’s conflict remains uncertain, with both sides vying for control of key territories.

Hamas agrees to US-supervised plan for post-war Gaza management, ...	Report outlines proposed administration plan establishing committee that would oversee enclave under US supervision; Palestinian Authority conditions agreement in Hamas recognizing its exclusive rule Qatari newspaper The New Arab published on Tuesday a draft of the document establishing the 'Community Support Committee for the Management of the Gaza Strip ' following discussions between Hamas and Fatah delegations in Cairo held last Saturday. According to the drafted document, which still requires approval from Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas, the committee will include experts from various fields who will manage the coastal enclave from both within Gaza and Palestinian Authority territories. The committee will also operate under U.S. supervision. The two-page document outlines the committee's role as the governing authority responsible for all sectors, including health, economy, education, agriculture, essential services and reconstruction efforts. It stresses the committee's formation as a national consensus body functioning under Palestinian state laws and regulations. The committee will comprise 10–15 members recognized for their integrity, experience and transparency. Its organizational structure includes a president, a vice president, officials for aid, education, health and economy, a local governance coordinator, a reconstruction director and a liaison for communication with local and international bodies. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Additionally, a border crossing representative will oversee the critical operation of the Rafah border crossing, a vital economic artery for Hamas before the war. The document specifies six foundational principles for the committee's establishment. The first stresses maintaining the territorial integrity of the 'occupied Palestinian state within the 1967 borders, including the West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza.' The second principle highlights coordination between the West Bank-based Palestinian government and the Gaza committee. The third affirms the committee’s alignment with the broader Palestinian political framework, rejecting any separation of Gaza from other Palestinian territories. The fourth calls for the selection of independent, qualified national figures to carry out the committee's tasks. The fifth aims to manage all local authorities in Gaza in a way that benefits the Palestinian public. The sixth principle reads that the committee will operate in Gaza until the 'reasons for its establishment are resolved, general elections are held or another agreed-upon solution is adopted.' Despite the emerging agreement, the committee's formation depends on Abbas's approval, which he currently conditions on Hamas recognizing the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole national representative of the Palestinian people. Should Abbas endorse the principles, a presidential decree would formalize them. If established, the committee marks a significant shift in Hamas's stance, as the terror group has so far resisted international involvement that would effectively strip it of control over Gaza. The move aligns with a Lebanese-style governance framework and includes external oversight of Gaza. This shift is part of Egypt's broader initiative to advance negotiations on a hostage deal and a cease-fire to end the war, meeting Israel's demand that Hamas no longer govern Gaza. However, despite this potential change, Hamas — currently operating in Gaza as a guerrilla organization and still inflicting losses on Israeli forces — is unlikely to disappear. Consequently, Israel is expected to continue insisting on complete freedom of action in Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkrpbmnqye	2024-12-02T22:47:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/03/Ske9Vz3mJe/Ske9Vz3mJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Facing teen terrorists and hidden tunnels: The IDF's long fight a...	Hamas reportedly rebuilding its Gaza City brigade, including recruiting teenagers, as IDF nears completion of buffer zone in enclave's center; Nahal Brigade targets Rafah resistance pockets, while 162nd Division wraps up major Jabaliya raid As the IDF enters the second year of combat in Gaza, military planning anticipates continued ground operations against Hamas for years to come, with or without a hostage deal. Despite the cease-fire in the north bringing quiet along the Lebanon border, Gaza remains a consistent focus of military activity, involving three divisions. The Gaza Division, the largest, concentrates on defending Israeli border communities, while the others work to secure operational gains by steadily advancing and taking control of strategic areas within Gaza. The nature of the fighting has evolved significantly since the conclusion of the Rafah ground offensive in August. IDF soldiers now patrol newly secured zones with fewer protective measures, conducting targeted operations only as needed against remaining Hamas resistance. Near Rafah, troops occupy fortified positions along a widened Philadelphi Corridor that now extends two to three kilometers into Gaza. This expansion involved flattening hundreds of Palestinian buildings, pushing the threat of sniper, anti-tank, or small-arms fire beyond effective range. In the Netzarim Corridor, which has grown bigger in size than Tel Aviv and where IDF reserve forces have been stationed for months, progress on establishing a buffer zone inside Gaza is nearing completion. Approximately 95% of the planned area—a strip averaging one to two kilometers wide—is secured, with ongoing tunnel detection and demolition operations targeting Hamas’ underground infrastructure. Elsewhere, the 162nd Division has made significant gains in Jabaliya, now requiring only one or two battalions to dismantle large Hamas strongholds in one night—operations that previously required two to three brigades. Supporting the divisions is an artillery battalion providing firepower across Gaza, from Rafah in the south, through Netzarim in the center and to Jabaliya in the north. Gaza Division: Defending from enemy territory The U.S. objections from last year to the demolition of thousands of buildings in favor of the construction of a buffer zone, the Gaza Division’s flagship project since being captured by terrorists during the October 7 Hamas attack, now seem like a distant memory. Once a densely built area, neighborhoods such as Beit Hanoun’s Officer Towers, once visible from Sderot, have been leveled, along with thousands of buildings in areas like Shijaiyah and Khirbet Khizeh, which directly threatened Israeli communities. According to military sources, the buffer zone now extends an average of one to two kilometers into Gaza, with nearly 95% of the project completed. The zone, cleared of orchards, fields and greenhouses, is tightly monitored, with strict rules of engagement. Soldiers are warned to exercise caution, as civilians—including children—have entered the zone in desperation, and there is concern that hostages escaping Hamas captivity—like Yotam Haim, Samar Talalka and Alon Shamriz, who were shot and killed by Israeli forces after a misidentification—might use the same route. The division has intensified efforts to locate and destroy Hamas’ cross-border tunnels, some of which remain undiscovered due to the extensive underground network near the border. IDF units are simultaneously targeting up to four tunnel routes, supported by advanced monitoring and detection systems that have significantly improved operational efficiency. The Gaza Division also oversees the logistical and operational support for two other divisions operating inside Gaza, bolstered by fortified forward bases established on the Israeli side of the border. What began as four battalion-level task forces responsible for border security on October 7 has grown to include armored, infantry and engineering units, as well as 'community battalions' specifically tasked with protecting kibbutzim and moshavim. The Gaza Division has intensified operations in areas that have seen little military activity in recent months, such as Khan Younis, opposite Kibbutz Kissufim. Additionally, the division has taken on exclusive responsibility for the Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza’s southern border, a shift from the 162nd Division prompted by manpower constraints. The task, handed over in August, is being carried out by the Nahal Brigade with three to four battalions rotating on a staggered schedule to allow regular leave. 'Initially, we were concerned about whether a defensive division could also manage a brigade inside Gaza, but it’s working because Nahal is experienced and effective there,' IDF officials said. They noted the corridor’s buffer zone has been expanded to 2–3 kilometers, pushing Hamas forces back and reducing threats. Soldiers stationed along Philadelphi now operate from secure outposts where they can move freely without helmets or vests, heightening their alertness for actual combat situations. Troops also benefit from improved conditions, including better living quarters and cellular coverage, though limited to the Israeli provider Cellcom. In Rafah, the IDF estimates that 1,000–2,000 Gazan civilians remain. The division’s goal is to push them northward toward Khan Younis and Al Mawasi. 'The border communities are coming back to life,' said an IDF source, estimating that 75% of residents have returned to their homes, though recovery has been slower in areas hardest hit, like Nir Oz and Be’eri. The Philadelphi Corridor, recently paved by the IDF into a 14-kilometer (9-mile) military highway stretching from Kerem Shalom to a coastal outpost, has undergone a dramatic transformation. The primary engineering focus in the area has been the systematic demolition of homes, which the IDF says were mostly used by Hamas or posed a threat to soldiers. This clearing has exposed a wide strip of land between the Sinai border and the vanishing line of houses south of Rafah. In the Al-Shaboura refugee camp alone, 300 buildings have been leveled. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Only some soldiers stationed along the corridor benefit from the improved living conditions provided by the IDF, which include new housing facilities and a cell tower, similar to one recently installed in the Netzarim Corridor. The Nahal Brigade, whose soldiers have sustained the longest continuous deployment in Gaza since the ground offensive began in late October of last year, is nearing a historic moment. They are expected to withdraw from Gaza and return to routine security assignments in the West Bank under the Judea and Samaria Division, from which they were redeployed on the morning of October 7. This transition marks the IDF’s effort to restore its pre-war battalion structure, easing some of the burden on reservists. The 99th Division: Threats persist even on Israeli territory The 99th Division, the youngest of the IDF's divisions under Central Command, was responsible for the Netzarim Corridor at the start of the year when it averaged two kilometers in width. Today, the corridor has expanded to approximately six kilometers, now equipped with cellular infrastructure, a new water line, comfortable outposts for soldiers and two brigades—northern and southern—tasked with widening the area further, extending from Gaza City neighborhoods in the north to central towns like Bureij and Nuseirat in the south. The soldiers’ primary role in the corridor mirrors that of the Philadelphi Corridor: securing and 'maintaining the achievement,' according to the IDF. The strategic gain in Netzarim is blocking the movement of Gazans from the southern to northern parts of the coastal enclave while encouraging the relocation of 300,000 people—out of the roughly one million who lived in northern Gaza before the war—southward. 'Today, there are almost no crossings in Netzarim, not even humanitarian or medical ones as before,' IDF officials said. 'We are establishing additional forward bases, increasing pressure on Hamas, which is effectively encircled on all sides by three IDF divisions.' The most recent significant operational event in the Netzarim sector occurred last week. A force from the northern brigade conducted a nighttime search raid between the Zeitoun and Sheikh Ajlin neighborhoods of Gaza City. During the operation, a Hamas fighter emerged from a combat tunnel and fired an RPG at an IDF bulldozer operator, severely injuring him. 'These searches continue to uncover large quantities of ammunition, Hamas equipment and weapons,' the military noted. 'In almost every operation, Hamas attempts counterattacks with sniper fire or other remote strikes.' The IDF assesses that Hamas is refraining from launching major attacks on static Israeli forces in the Netzarim Corridor, conserving its resources for a potential post-withdrawal phase, if and when it occurs. 'That’s why we are advancing more slowly and thoroughly from the corridor,' an IDF source explained. Hamas is reportedly focusing on rebuilding its Gaza City brigade, which has not been targeted by IDF operations for months, using terror to control the local population and prevent their relocation southward. The group has also been recruiting new fighters, some as young as 14, and attempting to develop weapons such as drones capable of carrying grenades. Gaza City forces still have commanders in place, including a brigade commander who has avoided elimination by keeping a low profile. Further south, in areas like Nuseirat, the situation differs. There, Hamas forces remain largely intact as the IDF has not conducted ground operations there, concerned about the potential presence of hostages. As southern Gaza is pushed northward from Rafah and the eastern border, Nuseirat is becoming increasingly crowded, merging with Deir al-Balah and Al Mawasi into a densely packed metropolitan area of displaced people along the coast. The IDF is also considering the possibility of a sea-based attack targeting forces stationed in the western part of the Netzarim Corridor. Military officials emphasized that operations in the Netzarim Corridor remain primarily operational, but as the timeline progresses and the likelihood of the remaining Israeli hostages perishing in Hamas tunnels increases, public legitimacy could grow for the establishment of Israeli settlements in the cleared area, along with repealing the Disengagement Law, which led to Israel's complete withdrawal from Gaza in 2005. 'We are keeping the enemy occupied from the Netzarim Corridor, preventing them from launching major attacks involving 50–60 fighters,' IDF officials said. They added that soldiers’ rotations are stable, with regular leave schedules allowing some forces to return home while others remain at outposts. 'Although we don’t officially classify this as routine security operations, there are clear patterns of repetition in the soldiers’ activities,' they noted. The corridor is currently held by two reserve brigades, the 551st and the 179th, whose soldiers have spent more time on duty than at home over the past 14 months. The 99th Division has described the reserve call-up orders for its forces as 'relaxed emergency orders,' allowing certain units, such as staff personnel, to return home between shifts, spending two to three days per week with their families. The 162nd Division: The occupied third IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi recently announced that the 162nd Division, the Southern Command’s regular spearhead division, will remain in Gaza through at least next year. Its brigades will not be redeployed to the northern front. Beyond the structural cohesion of the division, the decision is attributed to the experience and expertise its units have gained in over a year of combat against Hamas. These include the Givati and Nahal Brigades, the 401st Armored Brigade and the Multidimensional Unit, which has been integrated into the division. Currently, the 162nd Division is the only unit conducting a full-scale offensive within Gaza. Since late September, it has been leading a campaign in Jabaliya aimed at bisecting the northern third of the territory, separating Gaza City from the towns of Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia. The operation employs tactics reminiscent of the so-called 'Generals’ Plan,' involving the displacement of tens of thousands of Gazans southward through checkpoints where they are thoroughly screened. To date, over 1,000 individuals suspected of being Hamas operatives have been detained. An investigation by Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth reveals that, unlike in previous operations, Gazan civilians have not been allowed to return to neighborhoods cleared by the IDF in the ongoing offensive in Jabaliya, now entering its third month. The 162nd Division estimates the operation could conclude within weeks, as an estimated 100 to 200 Hamas terrorists remain entrenched in the Jabaliya refugee camp, a key stronghold. As part of the operation, the Kfir Brigade is conducting 'mop-up operations' on the northern and eastern edges of Jabaliya, as well as in Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, aiming to secure a safer environment for the return of Israeli residents in northern Gaza-border communities. A key characteristic of the fighting in Jabaliya is the efficiency of the experienced IDF forces, who are achieving more with fewer troops. Last week, Givati reconnaissance units, supported by aerial assistance, used just two-and-a-half companies to eliminate 40 terrorists and capture 100 others in a large Jabaliya complex, completing the mission in just three hours. Despite the progress, Hamas continues to mount resistance, occasionally targeting IDF forces. The operation has resulted in the deaths of approximately 30 soldiers so far, an average of one every two days. Among the fallen is Col. Ehsan Daxa, commander of the 401st Armored Brigade. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkvgyxnmjg	2024-12-02T21:57:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/02/ByYCqzoQyg/ByYCqzoQyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

'Please let this TRUTH serve to represent that if the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity. Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!' Trump's statement followed the IDF's confirmation that Captain Omer Neutra, an Israeli American soldier believed to have been held hostage since the October 7, 2023, terrorist attack, was killed, with his body still held by Hamas. Neutra, a Long Island native, was a tank commander in the 7th Armored Brigade's 77th Battalion. He was killed during Hamas’ infiltration of Israeli communities near the Gaza border. Neutra’s death was confirmed by the IDF chief rabbi after a thorough review of evidence and reliable information collected by the military. His family released their first statement following confirmation of his death. 'For 14 months, 423 days, we worked tirelessly to bring Omer home, holding onto hope that he was alive, despite the lack of any sign of life. This is an unimaginable nightmare,' said his parents, Orna and Ronen, and his brother, Daniel.

'On the morning of Simchat Torah, he and his team were the first on the front lines, alone in a disabled tank, as they used their bodies to protect Israel’s borders. They fought to the very end. For 423 days, we have waited for our leaders to rise to the occasion for the sake of Israel and the hostages, just as our beloved Omer did through his actions.' The family added, 'We never imagined, even in our worst nightmares, that we would find ourselves fighting for the values we instilled in Omer and for which he chose to make Aliyah and enlist—sanctity of life and mutual responsibility. Today, the sense of loss is overwhelming. The grief is immense. Words are exhausted, time has run out, and words alone cannot bring comfort. Leadership will be shown only through actions and results—by bringing the 101 hostages home.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byzg6tixyx	2024-12-02T10:51:57-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/13/ryD00G8fG1g/ryD00G8fG1g_0_91_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF warns Iran against weapons smuggling into Syria amid rebel fi...	Military spokesperson Hagari says IDF will 'act to prevent smuggling of weapons to Lebanon and Hezbollah through Syria' as Tehran sends reinforcements to aid flagging Assad regime IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari issued a stern warning to Iran on Monday, cautioning Tehran against exploiting the ongoing fighting between Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime and rebel forces to funnel Iranian weapons into the war-torn country. 'Israel is closely monitoring developments in Syria and observes that the Iranian regime is sending reinforcements to Syria,' Hagari told Sky News Arabia in an interview. 'Syria belongs to the Syrians, and we will ensure that Iran does not smuggle weapons to Lebanon and Hezbollah. We will act to prevent the smuggling of weapons to Lebanon and Hezbollah through Syria,' he said. Hagari emphasized Israel’s priorities, citing the country’s commitment to security and the lessons of the October 7 Hamas attacks. 'We need to ensure that we are not threatened,' he said, urging Lebanon to ensure its border regions remain free of weapons that could endanger Israel. He reiterated Israel’s commitment to the 60-day cease-fire process, designed to dismantle the Hezbollah threat, adding, 'UNIFIL forces and the Lebanese government must fulfill their roles—this is also in their interest.' Meanwhile, Ali Mohammad Naeini, spokesperson for Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps, vowed retaliation. 'The Syrian army and the resistance front will respond decisively and with force to Israel’s actions in Syria,' he said, accusing Israel of attempting to shift attention to Syria after failing to achieve objectives in Lebanon and Gaza. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Naeini dismissed Syrian rebel groups as 'mercenaries of Israel and the United States' and claimed Israel’s actions demonstrated its failures to disarm Hezbollah or weaken its political influence. The situation in Syria has intensified further with the arrival of two pro-Iranian militias from Iraq, who joined Syrian government forces to counter a rebel offensive that seized control of Aleppo over the weekend, according to Syrian military sources quoted by Reuters. Meanwhile, Israeli forces intercepted an Iranian aircraft suspected of transporting weapons to Hezbollah. The Mahan Air flight, bound for Syria, was turned back after Israeli fighter jets intercepted it over Syrian airspace. The operation, part of Israel’s enforcement of the cease-fire, marked a significant deviation from previous interceptions, which typically occurred over Lebanon. The interception aligns with the terms of the cease-fire and a U.S.-Israel letter of guarantees, which commits Washington to aid Israel in curbing Iran’s destabilizing activities in Lebanon and preventing the transfer of weapons and proxies from Iranian territory. Israeli officials described the operation as a clear signal to Iran that weapons transfers will not be tolerated. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjdloio7jg	2024-12-02T10:21:58-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/02/ByoJTAqmJg/ByoJTAqmJg_0_0_2537_1428_0_small.jpg

From the 'Jewel of Syria' to a symbol of sectarian bloodshed: Thi...	Anti-Assad forces seize one of world’s oldest cities, once home to vibrant Jewish community that fled before 1948; divided during Syria’s civil war, 2016 recapture by Assad marked turning point, but regime now faces renewed fight for control Aleppo, the capital of Syria’s northern Aleppo Governorate, stands near the Turkish border to the north, Ar-Raqqa to the east, and Idlib to the southwest. Spanning an area of 18,000 square kilometers (7,000 square miles)—roughly 10% of Syria’s total landmass—it is the country’s most populous governorate, home to approximately 5 million residents out of Syria's 23 million people. Once the industrial and economic engine of Syria, Aleppo was the nation’s largest city, an urban giant surrounded by other important towns like Afrin, Azaz, Jarabulus, Tell Rifaat, Al-Safira, Manbij and Ain al-Arab. Aleppo’s story stretches back millennia, making it one of the oldest cities on Earth. Its name echoes through history, first mentioned in Egyptian texts as far back as the 20th century BCE. Among its many treasures stands the Aleppo Citadel, an awe-inspiring fortress perched atop a hill in the city’s center. This architectural marvel, one of the largest citadels in the world, boasts a colossal staircase and a towering gateway at its entrance. Over the weekend, Syrian rebels stormed the ancient stronghold, posing triumphantly on its iconic steps—a striking symbol of their conquest. Encircled by walls and towers from eras long past, the citadel has borne witness to the rise and fall of rulers and the tumult of history. The vibrant population of Aleppo, primarily Sunni Muslim and predominantly Arab, is a mosaic of ethnicities and religions. The city is also home to Kurds, Turkmen, Christians, Armenians, Shiites and Alawites. For centuries, Aleppo was a thriving hub of Jewish life, a sanctuary for Jews expelled from Spain. But rising hostility in the 20th century led to a mass exodus, and by 1948, the once-flourishing Jewish community had all but vanished. When the Syrian uprising against President Bashar al-Assad erupted in 2011, Aleppo initially stood apart from the chaos engulfing other cities. But by 2012, the calm had shattered. The city became a bloody battleground, its streets echoing with the sounds of war. In February, two car bombings struck military intelligence and police compounds, killing 28 people. The conflict escalated as rebels sought to oust regime forces and establish dominance over northern Syria. Aleppo was split in two—a city divided, with opposition forces controlling the east and Assad’s regime clinging to the west. During this time, Aleppo became a cauldron of competing factions. ISIS, Kurdish militias and other rebel groups fought not only against the Assad regime but also among themselves. For years, the city endured a grinding war of attrition, its frontlines shifting like sands in the desert. The stalemate persisted until mid-2016, when Assad’s forces, bolstered by Russian airstrikes, cut off the rebels’ last supply route to eastern Aleppo, trapping 250,000 civilians under siege. By the year’s end, regime forces had reclaimed northern Aleppo, marking a pivotal moment in the war. The decade of fighting left Aleppo in ruins, with damages exceeding $7.5 billion. Now, the ancient city and its outskirts are once again the epicenter of conflict. Strategically, Aleppo is a prize of immense importance. Syria’s most vital highway, the international M5, runs through the city. Spanning 450 kilometers (280 miles), the M5 connects Syria’s southern border with Jordan to its northern border with Turkey, cutting through key cities like Daraa, Damascus, Homs and Hama. As the current fighting erupted, reports surfaced that rebels had seized parts of the highway in Aleppo’s countryside, giving them a crucial foothold for further advances. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another key route, the M4, links Aleppo to Iraq and cuts through Hama, Homs and Latakia. These roads, some controlled by Iranian-aligned Shia factions, serve as vital lifelines—but also as conduits for smuggling and illicit activities. The Aleppo region is also home to significant military and security sites. Over the weekend, reports indicated that rebels had captured a facility belonging to the Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC). This center, a hub for military development and production, is believed to host projects tied to the Iranian regime, further underscoring Aleppo’s strategic importance in the broader geopolitical struggle. Aleppo’s international airport has also become a flashpoint. On Saturday, the rebels announced that they had taken control of the airport, a vital link for Assad’s regime. Videos circulated on social media showing a rebel standing at the airport entrance, declaring: 'This airport was used by the criminal regime and its militias as an airbridge to kill innocent and defenseless civilians. Today, we put an end to that chapter. God willing, we will sever all the supply lines that the regime has relied on to spill the blood of the Syrian people.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1abuvoqkg	2024-12-02T09:10:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/01/HkJkOsFQye/HkJkOsFQye_0_114_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Dozens of Uzbek nationals denied entry to UAE and interrogated af...	Uzbekistan’s UAE embassy reports nearly 100 Uzbeks barred from entering Abu Dhabi under unclear circumstances; women and children detained but later released, while passports of dozens of men aged 20-40 confiscated, leaving them stranded at airport Dozens of Uzbek nationals were barred from entering the United Arab Emirates on Monday, reportedly due to the involvement of three Uzbek nationals in the kidnapping and murder of Chabad emissary Rabbi Zvi Kogan last month. According to Uzbekistan’s embassy in the UAE, the detained individuals were held for 'unknown reasons.' The Uzbeks, who had arrived in Abu Dhabi on a Wizz Air flight, were prevented from leaving the airport, had their passports confiscated and were subjected to questioning. Uzbekistan's Gazeta newspaper reported that a total of 91 Uzbek nationals, all men aged 20 to 40, were detained. Many of them claimed they were given no explanation for the entry denial or the interrogation. The detainees also alleged mistreatment during their confinement, claiming they were left without food for extended periods and were escorted to the restroom under guard. Many were forced to purchase return tickets at their own expense, which they described as a 'blatant violation' of their rights. The Uzbek embassy in the UAE confirmed the detentions, noting that 31 nationals were initially held at the airport, followed by an additional 10 and later 50 more. Embassy officials said they were unable to provide assistance to the detained citizens. Women, children and the elderly were eventually released, but men aged 20 to 40 now face potential deportation. One detained traveler shared his story: 'My brother and I were traveling to watch Formula 1, purely as tourists. There were also performances planned by Eminem, Maroon 5 and Teddy Swims.' He explained that other detainees had various reasons for their visits, including business meetings, family reunions and sightseeing. 'When we arrived, the passport control officers simply started pulling us aside and took our passports without any explanation,' he said. 'We sat there waiting for hours, hoping for some information. Later, they called us one by one, asked why we came, how long we planned to stay, and took our phone numbers, but didn’t answer any of our questions.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He continued, 'We sat there for 15 hours. Then, armed guards from the National Guard arrived and took us to another room, somewhere in the basement. The conditions were terrible—stifling, with no space to sit or lie down.' The situation has sparked growing concern among Uzbek nationals, who fear further detentions. The reasons for the crackdown remain unclear, with officials in both nations yet to provide comprehensive explanations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkhntmsxyx	2024-12-02T08:45:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/02/BJq00UzsXyg/BJq00UzsXyg_0_0_1200_800_0_small.jpg

Officials say decision to act now rests with Netanyahu and Katz; 'Failing to respond forcefully to the first violation will drag us into a war of attrition,' warns senior IDF official The IDF Operations and Intelligence Directorates have developed a contingency plan for a decisive response to cease-fire violations by Hezbollah, security officials said after the terrorist group fired two mortar rounds at Mount Dov on Monday evening, its first such attack since the cease-fire took effect last week. The officials said the decision to act now rests with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz. 'Failing to respond forcefully to the first violation will drag us into a war of attrition,' warned a senior IDF official involved in the planning. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack, describing it as a 'defensive warning.' In a statement, the group accused Israel of multiple cease-fire breaches, including airstrikes, attacks on civilians and violations of Lebanese airspace. Hezbollah said it fired at an IDF outpost on Mount Dov after failing to halt Israeli actions through other means. The attack, described as 'symbolic,' is seen as an attempt to signal readiness to retaliate for Israeli enforcement operations in southern Lebanon. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack a 'serious violation of the cease-fire' and vowed a strong response. 'We are determined to continue enforcing the cease-fire and to respond to every Hezbollah violation, no matter how minor or severe,' Netanyahu said in a statement. Defense Minister Katz voiced a similar threat. 'We promised to act against any Hezbollah violations of the cease-fire, and that is exactly what we will do. What was will no longer be,' he said. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich echoed the call for a strong retaliation, urging a strike that would 'make Hezbollah understand that the equation has changed.' Opposition leaders criticized the fragile cease-fire, with Yisrael Beitenu Chairman Avigdor Liberman calling it a 'conceptual failure.' 'Enough with the illusion. When the Israeli government realized that no agreements can be made with terrorists, only then will the State of Israel restore deterrence and security for its citizens,' he wrote on X. 'We must not wait until this costs us in blood.' Meanwhile, a parliamentary source in Hezbollah told the Qatari newspaper The New Arab that the attack was 'initial' and aimed to address Israel’s alleged violations. 'Hezbollah does not intend to return to the pre-cease-fire situation but will not stand idle while Israel breaches the agreement,' the source said.

Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The attacks came amid accusations from France and the United States that Israel has violated the cease-fire. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar dismissed these claims, saying, 'Israel enforces the agreement in response to Hezbollah violations, which require immediate action.' Sa’ar cited incidents such as armed Hezbollah operatives being spotted in southern Lebanon and attempts to transfer weapons as examples of violations demanding swift Israeli responses. Mount Dov, historically a flashpoint due to its lack of a defined border fence and civilian presence, remains a focal point for tensions between Hezbollah and the IDF. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sklzevsm1g	2024-12-02T07:50:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/29/SyG9i3VP71e/SyG9i3VP71e_0_0_1600_1066_0_small.jpg

Maya and Itay Regev, abducted alongside their friend Omer Shem Tov during Hamas massacre at Nova festival, try to rebuild their lives but remain in limbo as they wait for Omer and over 100 other captives to be freed Maya and Itay Regev, both abducted by Hamas during the Oct. 7 massacre and later freed, are struggling to rebuild their lives after the horrific ordeal. Maya says that until her close friend Omer Shem Tov is released, she cannot fully heal. 'Until Omer is back, this will not be over,' Maya says. 'Itay and I have been given the gift of life and the chance to tell our story from a safe place, but it follows us every minute of our lives, every second of every day. All we talk about is how Omer is not here.' 'I was the most normal girl,' she recalls. 'I worked to save up for my trip around the world. Then, I went to the other extreme, becoming someone who lives in a hospital, moving from surgeries to rehabilitation to check-ups. From being free to being stuck.' Maya was kidnapped from the Nova music festival along with her brother Itay and their friend Omer. She returned home after 50 days in captivity as part of the only hostage exchange deal to date. Wounded in her leg, she was hospitalized upon her return to Israel. 'During the first four days, until Itay came back, I felt helpless,' she says. 'I couldn't bring myself to take care of myself without him.' Maya has since undergone eight surgeries on her leg after her condition worsened. 'I've been athletic since I was three, and in one moment, I became someone who cannot do things on her own.' Now, three months after her last operation, she can walk and is undergoing rehabilitation. 'I can't run, but I can walk down the stairs, and that excites me.' Itay’s life also took a dramatic turn when he was taken hostage. 'I had a steady job, a date to enlist in the army and a clear plan for my life. Now, everything is different,' he says. 'We came back to an unfamiliar reality. Everyone knows who we are and our story. We’re learning to cope with that. This year has been filled with challenges. While I was in Gaza, I decided I would become a better version of myself. I was given my life back, and I plan to live it to the fullest. But I can’t move forward while Omer and the other 100 hostages are still captives.' Itay says he never imagined he could survive such an ordeal. 'If someone had told me what I would endure, I wouldn’t have believed I could get through it. But I discovered strength I didn’t know I had.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Maya echoes his sentiments. 'I never thought I’d speak publicly or give interviews, let alone care about the news. Now, I have all the apps and stay up to date. It’s partly a need for control, but mostly, I’m thinking about Omer.' Maya also says she was surprised by the Israeli public’s support for the hostages. 'When I was there, I thought there might be a protest once a week calling for our release, and otherwise, life would go on. When I got back, I was shocked. If I had known how many people were fighting for us, it would have given me so much more strength.' The two cannot imagine where they will be in a year, especially while hostages remain captive. 'I’m on hold,' Maya says. 'I imagine us with Omer, traveling the world—not forgetting our ordeal but growing together. Eating a good meal, maybe even jogging, though Omer might not agree because he’s lazy. I want people to know this is possible, that these are lives that can be saved.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b19wqljq1x	2024-12-02T07:31:57-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/01/Hy7LWobcX1g/Hy7LWobcX1g_0_63_1280_720_0_small.jpg

U.S. President Joe Biden expressed on Monday deep sorrow and outrage over the death of Omer Neutra, a 21-year-old Israeli American IDF soldier whose body has been held by Hamas since their deadly attack on October 7, 2023. Neutra, a Long Island native, was serving as a tank commander in the IDF and was among the first responders to the brutal assault, sacrificing his life to protect others. 'He dreamed of dedicating himself to building peace,' Biden said, recalling that Neutra had planned to return to the United States for college after completing his service. Biden also highlighted Neutra’s family history, noting that his grandparents were Holocaust survivors, and praised the strength and resilience of his parents, who recently met with him at the White House to share their pain and hope for their son’s safe return. Biden reaffirmed his commitment to securing the release of all remaining hostages, saying, 'We see you. We are with you.

The event honors Olim who have significantly contributed to Israel. Among the recipients is Shari Mendes, who transformed her life path after making Aliyah, by establishing a non-profit organization that provides financial assistance to women with breast cancer. In addition, this past year further deepened her connection to Israel and Zionism. Just as her grandmother's brother retrieved bodies from the gas chambers in Auschwitz, on October 7, Mendes volunteered with a team identifying victims of the massacre. Watch the ceremony live: Nefesh B'Nefesh honors, each year, Olim from English-speaking countries who have made a significant impact on Israeli society. This year marks the 10th ceremony, and is being held at the Beit Ha’am Cultural Center in Jerusalem. The awards will be presented to 12 Olim who have strengthened Israeli society and advanced Zionist values across fields such as education, culture, arts and sports, science and medicine, community and non-profit, and global impact. Among the award winners are Eylon Levy, head of the Israel Citizen Spokespersons’ Office; Fleur Hassan-Nahoum, Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Dr. Debra Gershov-West, Director of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Assuta Ashdod University Hospital; Phyllis Heimowitz, Co-Founder of the Partners of Fallen IDF Soldiers; Lt. Col. (res.) Danny Grossman, Chairman, CMBM-Israel; and Emily Schrader, journalist and human rights activist. Watch the ceremony live at the top of the page To immigrate to Israel and build the country One of the winners of the Bonei Zion Prize for Community and Non-Profit is Shari Mendes, Founder and CEO of 'Lemonade Israel.' Mendes, born in Pennsylvania, immigrated to Israel 21 years ago with her husband and teenage children, with the assistance of Nefesh B’Nefesh and in cooperation with the Ministry of Aliyah and Integration, The Jewish Agency for Israel, Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael and JNF-USA. The decision at the age of 40 to leave behind family, friends and established careers - hers in architecture and her husband’s, Dr. David Mendes, as a surgeon - was not easy. But the challenges did not deter her, and she was determined to fulfill her dream of making Aliyah. Mendes' love for Israel began at the age of 17 during a family visit: 'I fell in love. Even then I decided that I had to live here; it felt like home to me,' she said. 'I grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania, and we didn't have a large Jewish community. I loved the idea of Zionism, to be part of something bigger. Maybe that's why I chose to study architecture - to immigrate to Israel and help build the country.' At Columbia University, where she studied architecture, she met her future husband, David, an Israeli who moved to the U.S. at a young age with his family as part of an emissary mission. It was also clear to him that the day would come to return to Israel. In 2003, after years of sharing this dream, they took the leap and made Aliyah, settling in Ra'anana. 'It was during the intifada, and not many immigrants were moving at that time. It was a challenge, but we managed to build a warm community of friends for ourselves. It was also difficult for the children, but they acclimated. They joined the army, studied, got married and started families here of their own. A month ago my first granddaughter was born,' she shared excitedly. Making lemonade from lemons The dream of living an idyllic life in Israel was challenged in 2010, when Mendes underwent a routine mammogram where a cancerous lump was discovered. 'I entered the examination healthy and came out sick. In one minute, my whole life changed,' she said. Fortunately, the cancer was diagnosed at an early stage, which allowed for life-saving treatment - a message she emphasizes to every woman over 40. The first year of her illness was difficult, with long and exhausting treatments. In the waiting rooms between treatments, Mendes met many women in similar circumstances. She was amazed to discover that many sick women were more preoccupied with financial struggles than their health or taking care of their families. 'This is a long period of treatment that hurts the patients financially, as well. Some are single mothers, while others, especially this past year, have spouses in the reserves and have to take care of themselves alone, including mortgage payments, babysitters, taxis, and food.' Mendes emphasized that the medical system in Israel, when it comes to cancer treatment, is very advanced and breast cancer awareness is growing. But the economic concerns that consume the patients do not receive enough attention. After meeting a cancer patient at the clinic who couldn’t afford a washing machine, Mendes picked up the gauntlet and helped her purchase the machine through donations. From there, things progressed quickly, and Mendes found herself, while simultaneously undergoing treatments, establishing 'Lemonade Israel', an organization supporting breast cancer patients facing financial distress during treatments. It started small in Meir Hospital, but very quickly the organization’s activities expanded to almost all hospitals in the country. 14 and a half years after she founded the organization, 'Lemonade Israel' is still the only resource for women who struggle to meet the many expenses associated with treatment. The organization provides financial support to every woman diagnosed with breast cancer, 'including one percent of male breast cancer patients,' notes Mendes. 'I’m safest living here.' *Warning: The following paragraphs contain descriptions that might be difficult to read. Over the past year, in addition to her growing efforts to assist breast cancer patients, which has become a full-time job and more, Mendes has reluctantly become the voice of women on another front: the victims of the October 7 massacre. A decade ago, Mendes, alongside other women, joined a volunteer unit of the IDF Rabbinate to identify and prepare the bodies of female soldiers' for burial. 'There wasn't much activity in the unit, but a few months before the war, the volunteering shifted to reserve service, and we began training.' Then came October 7, and nothing could have prepared Mendes and her colleagues for the critical role they would play. In her chilling testimony, Mendes tells of the unimaginable amounts of body bags that were piled up for days at the Shura military base, where she reported for reserve duty. 'Our mission wasn’t forensic but religious. We opened the body bags and gave the women the dignity that the Hamas terrorists had violated. We removed jewelry and any identifying items to return them to their families.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: For over a year, Mendes has been traveling the world on advocacy missions, interviewing with foreign media channels and delegations to the United Nations, to share her testimony. Unfortunately, alongside immense support she has received, she also has faced voices denying the October 7 massacre. 'It comes through horrifying questions, such as - why weren’t rape tests conducted?' You describe such difficult and traumatic scenes, how do you deal with it? 'We are a team of strong women, and it was better that we did it than 18-year-old young soldiers. I come from a family of Holocaust survivors. My grandmother's brother was in the Sonderkommando in Auschwitz. His job was to take corpses out of the gas chambers. He was only 20 years old. On October 7, I realized that if he could do that, I could too. The thought of him made me stronger.' In 2023 you mentioned 20 years since immigrating to Israel. How did October 7 change your perception of Israel? 'It only made me stronger and proved to me that it was the right decision to immigrate to Israel. Every day I pinch myself, and I can't believe that I have the right to live here. I'm happy that I'm a Jew living in this country. I'm not afraid, on the contrary. I'm safest being a Jew here.'

Taliban policies reinforce ‘gender apartheid,’ silencing afghan w...	Organization for World Peace warns against accepting Taliban’s oppressive policies as normal and calls for global efforts to protect Afghan women [Islamabad] The Organization for World Peace (OWP) has called on the global community to take immediate action to prevent Afghanistan from devolving into a society defined by gender apartheid. The Canadian-based group’s latest report, published recently, warns that the international community must not accept the Taliban’s severe restrictions on women and girls as a 'new normal.' Since taking control of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has imposed increasingly draconian policies aimed at excluding women from public life, most recently targeting female entrepreneurs in Herat. In its report, OWP urged 'intensified efforts to elevate the voices of Afghan women and safeguard civic spaces.' It emphasized the importance of engaging with the Taliban constructively but cautioned against actions that could inadvertently grant legitimacy to the regime. OWP’s recommendations include providing financial and logistical support to Afghan human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations to counteract the repression. Systematic erosion of women’s rights The Taliban’s takeover has ushered in a grim chapter for Afghan women and girls. Policies implemented under the regime’s Law on the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice have essentially erased women from public life. These rules, which treat women as sources of moral corruption, require them to conceal their bodies, faces and even voices. In response, some Afghan women have resisted by posting videos in which they are singing, with messages such as 'My voice is not forbidden' and 'No to the Taliban.' However, punishment for defiance is severe. The Justice Ministry has warned that violations may result in property confiscation, detention for one hour to three days, public humiliation and 'any other punishment deemed appropriate.' 'Women are integral to the health and development of society,' OWP stated in its report. 'Their continued exclusion and disempowerment will only impede Afghanistan’s prospects for peace and prosperity.' A call for justice and equality Alexandra Trantos, a human rights activist affiliated with OWP, describes the Taliban’s gender policies as a mechanism for political control. 'Restricting women’s autonomy has become a tool for political manipulation and social control,' Trantos explains. She also highlights the psychological toll on Afghan women, who face profound mental health challenges from prolonged exclusion. She calls for immediate measures, such as creating safe spaces and ensuring access to counseling through nongovernmental organizations. Trantos also underscores the vital role of Afghan diaspora communities in supporting grassroots organizations, advocating for international aid, and amplifying the voices of women still in Afghanistan. 'Their fight is not merely a local struggle but a global call for justice and equality,' she concludes. International reactions and condemnations UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk issued a video statement Friday denouncing the Taliban’s treatment of women. Türk called the policies a 'flagrant disregard for half the population' and described the restrictions as a 'national calamity.' He urged the Taliban to reverse its discriminatory measures and restore women’s fundamental rights, warning that continued repression jeopardizes Afghanistan’s future. Türk specifically criticized the closure of all women-only cafés in Herat, which had been a rare refuge for female entrepreneurs. These spaces not only provided income but also offered an opportunity for social connection in an otherwise restrictive environment. Their elimination marks another blow to Afghan women’s autonomy. Closure of women-only cafés The closure of the women-only coffee shops in Herat, where six such businesses had sprung up in recent years, illustrates the Taliban’s systematic dismantling of women’s freedoms. These cafés were essential for many women, both as a source of income and as spaces for mutual support in a deeply segregated society. Laila Fatima Zaidey, a former political science student in Herat, described her experience with the Taliban. 'I was in my third semester when the Taliban decree halted my education,' Zaidey said. She then opened a coffee bar exclusively for women, where they could meet freely. Despite complying with the Taliban’s strict dress codes, her business was forced to shut down. Zaidey lamented the broader implications of the closures, noting that educated women in Herat – once a beacon of progress – are now largely confined to their homes. 'This is causing immense stress and frustration,' she said. A bleak governance landscape Barakat Rahmati, a nonresident research fellow at the Afghanistan Policy Lab in Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs and a former Afghan diplomat, says this is a continuation of the Taliban's goal of erasing women. 'The recent closure of women-only cafés in Herat is a stark reminder of the Taliban’s ongoing campaign against women and girls in Afghanistan.' 'These spaces, vital lifelines for female entrepreneurs and a rare sanctuary for connection, have been obliterated under a regime enforcing systemic gender apartheid,' he charged. Rahmati said the regime’s exclusionary policies threaten Afghanistan’s cultural diversity and long-term stability. 'The Taliban are imposing a rigid cultural doctrine under the guise of Islam,' he warned. He also criticized the international community for its passive response, arguing that ongoing humanitarian aid inadvertently legitimizes the regime. 'This passivity risks normalizing the oppressive regime,' he said. Global implications of Taliban actions Irina Tsukerman, a human rights and national security expert based in New York, echoed these concerns. She pointed out that, as the Taliban gains acceptance from some international actors, it faces less pressure to reform. 'This growing acceptance enables the Taliban to solidify its oppressive policies while reinforcing its control over Afghan society,' Tsukerman said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: She criticized the relative silence of women’s rights organizations in the West, attributing their lack of influence to insufficient political and economic leverage. Tsukerman also warned that the Taliban’s actions could fuel ideological extremism, posing broader risks to global security. Moving forward and supporting Afghan women The OWP report and statements from experts highlight an urgent need for coordinated international action to address Afghanistan’s deteriorating human rights situation. Advocates stress that supporting Afghan women requires not only humanitarian aid but also sustained diplomatic pressure to ensure that progress is made toward gender equality and social inclusion. As the world watches, Afghan women continue to resist in small but significant ways. Their fight is not only for survival but also for a future where their voices and contributions are recognized as essential to Afghanistan’s prosperity.

Hezbollah fires mortars into Israel for first time since cease-fi...	Two projectiles fired from Lebanon land in an unpopulated area in the Mount Dov sector For the first time since the cease-fire took effect last week, Hezbollah fired two suspected mortar rounds into Israeli territory on Monday evening. The shells landed in open areas on Mount Dov, causing no casualties or damage. Israeli officials described the incident as a symbolic violation, likely intended as a warning to Israel in response to IDF enforcement actions against Hezbollah's activities in southern Lebanon. Mount Dov, historically a flashpoint due to the absence of a physical border fence and Israeli civilian presence, has long served as a staging ground for such exchanges. The attack occurred amid accusations from France and the United States that Israel is violating the Lebanon cease-fire agreement. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar rejected the claims, stating that Israel’s actions are necessary to counter Hezbollah violations. 'Their presence south of the Litani River is the most fundamental breach of the agreement, and we will not tolerate a return to the pre-October 6 situation,' Sa’ar said, reaffirming Israel’s commitment to enforce the cease-fire and respond to immediate threats. Earlier, Sa’ar held talks with his French counterpart, Jean-Noël Barrot, who emphasized the importance of all sides respecting the cease-fire. Barrot linked the Lebanon truce to broader regional stability, advocating for a cease-fire in Gaza, the release of hostages and expanded humanitarian aid. The two officials also discussed Syria, Iran’s nuclear ambitions and ongoing tensions in Yemen. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israeli diplomatic sources defended the country’s enforcement actions, citing a U.S.-endorsed side agreement that permits immediate responses to imminent threats in southern Lebanon without recourse to the monitoring mechanism. 'In the agreement’s early stages, it is crucial to enforce violations strongly to set the tone,' a senior official explained, adding that Israel’s actions align with its understanding with the U.S. Israel also addressed the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense chief Yoav Gallant. Officials expressed confidence in U.S. support to counter the ICC’s moves, with expectations that a future Trump administration or U.S. legislative action might bolster Israel’s position. Meanwhile, Israeli forces have intensified operations against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, striking targets and sending strong deterrent messages. 'We’ve inflicted significant damage, more than any coalition has to date, and we’ll continue to act decisively if necessary,' a government source said. The situation underscores the fragile dynamics in the region, as Israel balances immediate security threats with broader geopolitical challenges. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy11larixyx	2024-12-02T06:14:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/30/BJ5I50000XJg/BJ5I50000XJg_0_212_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

The discussions took place before anti-Assad rebels swept into Aleppo last week in their biggest offensive in Syria for years; If Assad embraces Iranian help for a counter-offensive, that could complicate efforts to drive a wedge between them The U.S. and the United Arab Emirates have discussed with each other the possibility of lifting sanctions on Syrian President Bashar Assad if he peels himself away from Iran and cuts off weapons routes to Lebanon's Hezbollah, five people familiar with the matter said. The conversations intensified in recent months, the sources said, driven by the possible expiry on Dec. 20 of sweeping U.S. sanctions on Syria and by Israel's campaign against Tehran's regional network, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and Iranian assets in Syria. The discussions took place before anti-Assad rebels swept into Aleppo last week in their biggest offensive in Syria for years. According to the sources, the new rebel advance is a signal of precisely the sort of weakness in Assad's alliance with Iran that the Emirati and U.S. initiative aims to exploit. But if Assad embraces Iranian help for a counter-offensive, that could also complicate efforts to drive a wedge between them, the sources said. Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araqchi visited Syria on Sunday in a show of support for Assad, and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke to Assad by phone about latest developments at the weekend. For this story, Reuters spoke to two U.S. sources, four Syrian and Lebanese interlocutors and two foreign diplomats who said the U.S. and UAE see a window to drive a wedge between Assad and Iran, which helped him recapture swathes of his country during the civil war that erupted in 2011. Lebanese media have reported that Israel had suggested lifting U.S. sanctions on Syria. But the UAE initiative with the U.S. has not previously been reported. All of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the back-room diplomacy. Syria's government and the White House did not respond to questions from Reuters. The UAE referred Reuters to its statement on bin Zayed's call with Assad. The UAE has taken a leading role in rehabilitating Assad among the mainly Sunni Muslim Arab states that shunned him after he accepted help from Shi'ite, non-Arab Iran to put down the Sunni-led rebellion against him. The Emirates hosted Assad in 2022, his first visit to an Arab country since the start of the war, before the Arab League reinstated Syria's membership. The UAE has long hoped to distance Assad from Iran and wants to build business ties with Syria, but U.S. sanctions have hampered those efforts, the sources said. A senior regional diplomat briefed by Tehran told Reuters Iran had been informed 'about behind-the-scenes efforts by some Arab countries to isolate Iran... by distancing Syria from Tehran'. The diplomat said those efforts were linked to offers of possible sanctions relief by Washington. 'Carrot and stick' Hezbollah and its patron Iran have intervened in Syria since 2012 to protect Assad against Sunni rebels - but their bases and weapons shipments through Syria have been repeatedly hit by Israel, which has sought to weaken Iran across the region. In recent months, Hezbollah withdrew fighters from Syria, including the north, to focus on battling Israel in southern Lebanon. The rebels who swept this week into Aleppo pointed to the Hezbollah withdrawal as one of the reasons why they faced little resistance from government forces. A U.S. source familiar with the matter said White House officials discussed an overture with Emirati officials, citing the UAE's interest in financing Syria's reconstruction and Assad's 'weakened position' after Israel's offensive against Hezbollah. The possibility of sanctions relief for Assad, while Israel was hitting Iran's allies, created an 'opportunity' to apply a 'carrot-and-stick approach' to fracture Syria's alliance with Iran and Hezbollah, the U.S. source said. Sanctions relief The U.S. placed sanctions on Syria after Assad cracked down against protests against him in 2011, and the sanctions were repeatedly tightened in the years of war that followed. The toughest, known as the Caesar Act, passed Congress in 2019. The Caesar sanctions apply across Syrian business sectors, to anyone dealing with Syria regardless of nationality and to those dealing with Russian and Iranian entities in Syria. Assad said they amounted to economic warfare, blaming them for the Syrian currency's collapse and drop in living standards. The sanctions will 'sunset' - or expire - on Dec. 20 unless renewed by U.S. lawmakers. Part of the recent American-Emirati discussions centered on allowing Caesar sanctions to expire without renewal, said the U.S. source and three of the Syrian interlocutors. One Syrian interlocutor said the UAE had raised letting them expire with White House officials two months ago, after having unsuccessfully pushed for at least two years of sanctions relief for Assad after a deadly earthquake in Feb. 2023. Mohammad Alaa Ghanem, a Syrian activist in Washington, D.C. with the Citizens for a Secure and Safe America, told Reuters his group had been working to extend the Caesar sanctions and assessed they had bipartisan support to do so. 'We've been in talks over this for the past couple of months, although of course no political outcome in a town like Washington can be guaranteed 100%,' he said. Arab states have other potential avenues to reward Assad for distancing himself from Iran. A foreign diplomat based in the Gulf told Reuters both the UAE and Saudi Arabia had in recent months offered 'financial incentives' to Assad to split with Iran, saying they could not have been made without coordination with Washington. A source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that Syria, among other crises in the region, was a topic of discussion during Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's visit to the UAE on Sunday. A Lebanese interlocutor said the UAE had also pledged funds to help Syria rebuild war-ravaged infrastructure as a way to 'pull Assad further away from Iran'. Iran has warned Assad not to stray far. The senior regional diplomat briefed by Tehran said Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei conveyed a message via his senior adviser Ali Larijani, who told Assad: 'do not forget the past.' 'The message served as a reminder to Assad of who his true allies are,' the diplomat said. Hundreds of fighters from Iran-backed Iraqi militias crossed into Syria overnight to help the government fight rebels who seized Aleppo last week, Syrian and Iraqi sources said on Monday, and Tehran pledged to aid the Damascus government. At least 300 fighters, primarily from the Badr and Nujabaa groups, crossed late on Sunday using a dirt road to avoid the official border crossing, two Iraqi security sources said. 'These are fresh reinforcements being sent to aid our comrades on the front lines in the north,' a senior Syrian military source said, adding the fighters had crossed in small groups to avoid airstrikes. 'Playing with fire' Since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7 last year precipitating war in Gaza, Iran has mobilized its network of allies to hit Israel. But Assad has largely avoided joining in, even as Israel struck Hezbollah targets in his country and bombed an Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus. A U.S. official said Assad had 'sat out' the war to avoid further Israeli strikes on Syria, and remained under 'tremendous pressure' not to allow Hezbollah to re-arm through his country.

IDF builds bases and demolishes hundreds of buildings in central ...	Satellite images show at least 19 large bases built - 12 since September, as well as fortifications, communication towers and outposts constructed, while some 600 building are demolished to create a buffer zone in the strip, report states The IDF has been expanding its construction of defensive fortifications, outposts and communication towers in Gaza, the New York Times reported on Monday. Satellite images and Israeli officials confirmed the report. The newspaper said the military has demolished over 600 buildings around the Netzarim Corridor in the past three months, 'in an apparent attempt to create a buffer zone.' The newspaper said the corridor has slowly grown into an 18-square-mile (46.6 square kilometer) block of territory controlled by troops, according to the IDF and a New York Times analysis of satellite images and video footage. In the report, the paper said that control of the Netzarim Corridor, which cuts across Gaza from the border with Israel to the Mediterranean Sea, allows the IDF to 'regulate' the movement of Palestinians, keeping hundreds of thousands of displaced Gazans at the south of the Strip. Analysis of the satellite images, according to the report, reveals that the IDF has at least 19 large bases throughout the area and dozens of small ones. 'While some were built earlier in the war, the imagery also shows that the pace of construction appears to be accelerating: Twelve of the bases were either built or expanded since early September.'

Shin Bet uncovers widespread Iran campaign targeting Israeli offi...	Security agency says uncovered 200 attempts to target Israelis including security officials, politicians, journalists and others in effort to obtain access to their devices for the purpose of launching attacks The Shin Bet on Monday said it exposed 200 attempts of cyber attacks by Iranian operatives, targeting Israelis including public figures. 'The Shin Bet uncovered an Iranian phishing campaign aimed at Israeli citizens, some senior members of the security echelons, politicians, members of academia, journalists and others,' the Shin Bet said in a statement. 'The aim of the Iranian campaign was to get access to computerized media systems: e-mail, computers, smartphones) of Israelis the Iranians planned to attack, in order to access personal information such as home addresses, contacts and places where they regularly stay. This information is then to be used by the Iranians to attack Israeli officials using enlisted operatives. Nine such local cells enlisted by Iran to carry out missions on its behalf, were discovered in recent months.' The security agency said most Israelis targeted in the campaign are approached over WhatsApp, Telegram or email with an appropriate cover story prepared for each target, to avoid suspicion. The method is to cause the target to download an app containing malware on to his computer or phone, or to refer the targets to an internet site that poses as a legitimate service, but requires personal information to be given, such as a private or professional email address. After the target reveals the address and a password, the Iranian operatives then take that information and through it accesses the target's devices. After the Shin Bet identified the malicious campaign, an investigation was launched which revealed the extent of the attacks and identified its targets. They were informed and were advised what steps must be taken to avert danger and bolster their online security systems.

The tragic events of recent weeks have highlighted the severe shortage of protective measures in Arab towns. The rockets fell on Majd al-Krum, Tamra, Sha’ab, Tira, and Shfaram. The deaths of a mother and her son during an olive harvest near Kiryat Ata underscored the devastating toll borne by the Arab community. These incidents also offered a glimpse into life without adequate protection. According to published data, almost 60% of homes in Arab communities lack fortified safe rooms, and 60% of local Arab municipalities have no public shelters at all. For example, a stark contrast exists between Karmiel, which has 126 public shelters (one for every 375 residents), and nearby Arab towns, which collectively have only two shelters (one for every 15,000 residents). Calls for action Organizations such as Ajyal and Merkazim - center for social justice in Arab society have long been dedicated to fostering civic, community and political engagement. These groups train and mobilize activists to lead local and regional change. However, they recently added a new objective: Assisting citizens in the face of security threats and enhancing the sense of safety. 'We cannot leave Arab society behind,' a statement from Ajyal emphasized. The organization’s efforts include participation in local emergency steering committees, conducting first-aid courses, training emergency response volunteers, and mobilizing donations for low-income families. It also advocates for better protection in Arab towns by working with local authorities. In Majd al-Krum, Merkazim is providing targeted training and practical tools to equip activists for emergency situations. These courses include crisis management skills, rapid response techniques, and psycho-social training to help them support their communities in times of need. The vulnerability of open spaces Meanwhile, the olive harvest season is underway in Shfaram, Majd al-Krum, Tamra, and other Arab towns. For many families, the open fields where they harvest olives lack any form of protection. This poses a significant risk as these areas are far from the built-up parts of their towns. The olive harvest is a vital source of income, particularly during wartime, as the construction sector – another major source of livelihood – has been largely inaccessible for over a year. Ayman Kabha, Ajyal coordinator and leader of the social justice centers in Arab society, stressed the importance of equitable emergency services and protection systems. 'In a time when security threats demand we adapt to a new reality, the state must ensure that emergency services and protective measures are accessible and equal for all populations, regardless of ethnic or cultural background. Arab society must not be left behind in the fight for personal and community safety.' Personal stories of fear and resilience Residents have shared harrowing accounts of living in fear. Nili Hijazi, a Tamra resident, described the lack of shelters in her town. 'The situation in Tamra is painful. We feel unsafe, and there are no shelters. My children ask, ‘Where will we go? Will we die? Will the house collapse on us?’ When a rocket fell in our neighborhood, I thought the world was ending. I left work in Haifa and rushed home, searching for my youngest son. I found him handing out water bottles to victims, trying to help in any way he could. That’s the reality we live in – fear, helplessness and survival.' Inbar, a Jewish woman who converted to Islam and has lived in Tamra for a decade, echoed similar concerns. 'Our homes are not fortified, and there are no shelters. During alarms, we search for the innermost wall and pray to God for safety. When rockets disabled the education system, the fear for our children grew. Each child is in a different location, and it’s difficult to reunite the family without knowing how to protect ourselves,' she said. Amar Hammam, also from Tamra, described his terror. 'I never thought our lives were this disposable. I felt as though Judgment Day had arrived. There was nowhere to run, no safe place. As I drove home to my family, I feared both the rockets and the reckless speed I was driving. The sky seemed to collapse around me. I just wanted to embrace my wife and children. But until when? We need answers and solutions even after the cease-fire,' he explained. Ghada al-Youssef, a mother of five and head of the Social Justice Center in Tamra, said the Arab community should be provided with shelters. 'We deserve to be treated as human beings. One of the most basic human rights is the right to safety. Without shelters, every alarm could mean the death of a loved one. As a volunteer with the parents’ committee, the responsibility to protect our children weighs heavily. We live in constant fear – from the moment school begins until our children return home safely,' she said. Nermin, a mother from Majd al-Krum, described a similar reality. 'Every alarm wakes me in panic. I grab my two youngest children, ages 4 and 5, and rush downstairs with my older kids. The stress is overwhelming, and sometimes the children trip on the stairs in their haste. The lack of sleep and constant fear take a toll on our health. We need shelters to feel secure,' she said. Many residents question whether the Iron Dome anti-missile system is being deployed equally. 'How is it that rockets fall here more frequently than anywhere else?' asked a resident of Ba’ana. 'It seems like Iron Dome isn’t activated above Arab towns. Does the government not care about Arab lives?' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another resident from Deir al-Asad added: 'It feels like the government doesn’t value our blood. Every rocket that falls here reminds us of that.' The collective plea from Arab citizens is clear: Safety and dignity should not depend on ethnicity or geography. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byjjnfiqke	2024-12-02T03:48:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/19/HyehHTRYM1l/HyehHTRYM1l_0_123_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

US warns Israel it is violating cease-fire in Lebanon	Warning comes after Paris accuses Israel of non-compliance; Amos Hochstein, who brokered the deal, accuses Israel of violations in message to Jerusalem counterparts; Violations include return of drones to skies over Beirut; On Monday morning, IDF attacked 3 areas in southern Lebanon where Hezbollah activity was detected. The United States has warned Israel that it is violating the terms of the cease-fire agreement with Lebanon. According to sources familiar with the details who spoke to Ynet, 'there were Israeli violations of the cease-fire agreement, mainly the visible and audible return of Israeli drones in the skies over Beirut.' The same sources said that in order for the cease-fire to last, 'we need restraint from all sides.' France first warned Israel that it was violating the cease-fire, first reported by Ynet on Sunday, but now the United States has joined these warnings as well. According to the sources, Amos Hochstein, who brokered the deal, accused Israel of the violations in a message to his counterparts in Jerusalem. Foreign Minister Gideon Saar on Monday morning told his French counterpart Jean-Noël Barrot that Israel was not violating the cease-fire agreement in Lebanon but enforcing it amid Hezbollah's violations, that require a real-time response. France claimed Israel had failed to report Hezbollah's violations to the international commission and had used lethal force resulting in the death of civilians. 'Hezbollah's presence south of the Litani is a fundamental violation of the agreement. They must move north,' Saar said. He called on the Lebanese government to 'clearly authorize the Lebanese army to carry out the actions required of it under the agreement.'

Gallant praises IDF in Brooklyn: 'War achievements are thanks to ...	Former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant praised Israel's 'unprecedented achievements,' crediting the IDF and God, and spoke about Hamas, saying it is 'a dismantled organization, we’ve struck them a devastating blow. Their leaders – Yahya Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh, Mohammed Deif – are all gone' Fired former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant visited the Chabad headquarters in Brooklyn on Sunday, marking his first trip to the United States since being dismissed from his post about a month ago. Speaking to attendees, Gallant reflected on Israel’s curent war, calling it a war that 'brought us unprecedented achievements.' He attributed these successes to 'the actions of IDF soldiers and the miracle of God,' drawing applause from the audience. 'This is my first visit to the United States – here in New York, in Brooklyn – since the war that was forced upon us,' Gallant began. 'We launched this campaign on Simchat Torah, one of the most challenging days for the Jewish people, the hardest since World War II and the Holocaust. Our enemies thought they could defeat us. We saw it in the documents we retrieved from their computers in Gaza.' Gallant referenced the October 7 attack by Hamas that ignited the war, which was followed by Hezbollah’s actions on October 8 and involvement from additional adversaries on seven fronts. He emphasized Israel’s decisive response. 'Thirteen months after the war began, Hamas is a dismantled organization. We’ve struck them a devastating blow. Their leaders – Yahya Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh, Mohammed Deif – are gone. In the north, too, remember Nasrallah’s boasts and threats? We neutralized them. There’s no Nasrallah, no Sinwar, none of the others.' He credited these outcomes to a combination of national faith, global Jewish support, and the extraordinary sacrifices of Israel’s soldiers. 'This couldn’t have happened without the faith of the Jewish people, the prayers of millions around the world, and the heroic actions of our soldiers. They deserve all the praise. As someone who led this campaign, I knew I was doing so in the name of Israel and as a messenger of the Almighty, the Lord of Hosts. We are Jews; we have a land and a nation.' Gallant’s itinerary includes a stop in Washington, D.C., where he is expected to meet with senior officials at the White House and State Department.

The headquarters of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said after the announcement of Neutra's death that he 'loved sports, played soccer, basketball and volleyball and was the captain of sports teams at his school.

About 700 people, including his family members and friends, at the time held a march around Manhattan, New York. Friends came from all over and they received videos from those who could not make it, according to his mother. 'It was an exciting and powerful event. To see all these friends, especially after such a long time without seeing them. It was an event that testified to his character, only he was missing.'

During a routine check, the terrorist, who shot a Jew who was on his way to the synagogue, was discovered unconscious in a city prison; He was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead; Sidi Mohamed Abdallahi - who was accused of six counts of attempted murder - appears to have taken his own life Sidi Mohamed Abdallahi, a 22-year-old Muslim migrant who shot a Jew and planned attacks against Jews in Chicago , was found lifeless in a city prison after an apparent suicide attempt, according to the local sheriff's office. Abdallahi, an illegal immigrant from Mauritania who had lived in the U.S. for at least two years and worked for Amazon, was hospitalized for gunshot wounds sustained during a shootout with police. He had been in the prison's medical facility since November 15. During a routine security check, he was found unconscious. CPR was administered, and he was then taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, according to the sheriff's office; No foul play is suspected. The state of Illinois launched an independent investigation, as is customary in cases of this type. Abdullahi was charged last month with attempted murder, shooting at vehicles, a hate crime and an act of terrorism. On October 26, he shot a 39-year-old ultra-Orthodox man who was walking to synagogue in Chicago's West Rogers Park neighborhood. The injured man was taken to the hospital and released after treatment. Abdullahi yelled 'Allahu Akbar' as he exchanged fire with responding officers during the arrest attempt.

French far right party likely to back no-confidence motion agains...	France's far-right National Rally (RN) party will likely back a no-confidence motion against the government in the coming days unless there is a 'last minute miracle,' RN President Jordan Bardella said on Monday. RN lawmaker Marine Le Pen has given Prime Minister Michel Barnier until Monday to yield to the party's budget demands or face the threat that they would back a no-confidence motion against his government, which would lead to its collapse. Barnier dropped a planned electricity tax increase last week, but the RN also wants him to raise pensions in line with inflation whereas he had aimed to increase some of them less than inflation to save money. The RN is also calling for planned cuts to medication reimbursements to be scrapped and is unhappy the government may raise tax on gas. It also wants a reduction in France's contribution to the European Union's budget among other demands. The standoff between the government could come to a head as early as Monday if Barnier has to use aggressive constitutional powers to force a social security financing bill through, which would inevitably trigger a no-confidence motion from the left. sion.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkdsnjj7yx	2024-12-01T22:43:01-08:00

Trump meets Sara Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago	President-elect's press secretary posts photo on social media showing the two during a dinner at the Florida golf club during Sara's weeks-long stay visiting her son in Miami The wife of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Sara, met with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago Gulf Club late on Sunday. Trump's media advisor posted a photo of the two on X. Sara Netanyahu was in Miami for a 20-day visit with her son Yair, who has been living there. She is not expected to be in Israel when her husband testifies in his criminal trial for corruption, scheduled for next week. 'I raised the suffering of our country since October 7, the inhumanity of the Hamas terrorists who have been holding our citizens hostage under difficult conditions. I stressed the urgency to act for their release and quick return,' she said in a post. 'We discussed the strategic importance of Israel's victory in the war against the axis of evil, for a stable and secure future in the Middle-East and the entire world.' The prime minister met with Trump last August after Trump had expressed is dissatisfaction with the prime minister for congratulating Joe Biden for his win in 2020. 'We've always had a great relationship,' Trump then said, after journalists inquired if they two were now on good terms.

Security officials say optimal conditions for a Gaza deal	Senior members of the IDF tell the government that factors including the end of the war with Hezbollah, internal Gazan opposition and the incoming Trump administration are all motivations for Hamas to agree Security officials now see an opportunity for a breakthrough in the negotiations to free the Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, and have recommended to the political leadership to seize this chance to end the war in Gaza temporarily and make a deal, according to senior members of the IDF who are in key positions, including some who were skeptical in the past that a deal could be reached. Their view relies on a configuration of a number of factors that together change the reality on the ground: the end to the fighting in Lebanon, the separation of fronts and deployment of most of the military to Gaza, the situation in Syria, internal pressure inside the Strip, public pressure on the Israeli government and finally, the incoming Trump administration. All those, the officials said were in addition to the efforts of Egypt to advance a deal. Although no concrete offer has been put on the table, the IDF and security officials observe a path for Hamas to agree to a cease-fire. A senior official who spoke to Ynet said that if such a deal would be agreed, its details were still unclear, but Israel was at a critical time and that could change the nature of the war. Despite what some see as a missed opportunity, the cease-fire deal in Lebanon has the potential to put significant pressure on Hamas in Gaza. While Hezbollah has been an insurance policy for Hamas since the Oct. 7 massacre, it has now abandoned the Islamist group in Gaza. Israel's attention and military might has now shifted its focused on the Strip and there is unity between the government and the new Trump administration. All those have a significant effect on the decision makers who are still hiding in the tunnels in Gaza. In side Gaza there is growing discontent after the civilian population has suffered the effects of the war. 'There are large families challenging Hamas and no longer accepting its authority,' the officials said although they added that this reality was still a far cry from a real uprising. 'Hamas's military infrastructure is all but destroyed. The only thing the terror-group has is the public, so it is directing its remaining efforts towards maintaining its basic governing abilities.' The officials believe a deal now, could help Hamas stabilize its rule and preserve its position among Gazan's and remove any opposition groups, such as those families which are fighting for control of the humanitarian aid, using violent means. The officials agree that Hamas would not easily give up the hostages, who are its final negotiating tool left in its arsenal. The hostages, both dead and alive, are the only factor keeping Hamas in power, they said. While there might still be compromise, including over some IDF forces remaining along the Phildelphy corridor and in the area near the border with Israel, a withdrawal from the Netzarim corridor would for Israel mean there is no military presence in Gaza proper. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another obstacle would be the release of convicted Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. The IDF and Shin Bet have been working for the past year, to 'clean' Gaza from terrorists and a deal could return hardened terrorists back into the Strip, to rebuild Hamas. But despite those obstacles and any other demands that Hamas or the Egyptians might inject into the negotiations, the security officials believe this is the best time to reach a deal. The fighting in Jabaliya continues, Rafah is all but destroyed, 90% of the population of the Strip is concentrated around Khan Younis and the military is prepared to launch its offensive in other areas. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjeb6tc7jl	2024-12-01T21:12:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/29/H1gWFjw7ke/H1gWFjw7ke_0_162_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
At least 25 killed as Russian, Syrian jets intensify bombing of S...	The Syrian army and its ally Russia say they target the hideouts of insurgent groups and deny attacking civilians; army also says it had recaptured several towns that rebels had overrun in recent days At least 25 people were killed in northwestern Syria in air strikes carried out by the Syrian government and Russia, the Syrian opposition-run rescue service known as the White Helmets said early on Monday. Russian and Syrian jets struck the rebel-held city of Idlib in northern Syria on Sunday, military sources said, as President Bashar al-Assad vowed to crush insurgents who had swept into the city of Aleppo. The army also said it had recaptured several towns that rebels had overrun in recent days. Residents said one attack hit a crowded residential area in the center of Idlib, the largest city in a rebel enclave near the Turkish border where around four million people live in makeshift tents and dwellings. At least seven people were killed and dozens injured, according to rescuers at the scene. The Syrian army and its ally Russia say they target the hideouts of insurgent groups and deny attacking civilians. Ten children were among the dead in the air strikes in and around Idlib and other targets in rebel-held territory near Aleppo on Sunday, according the White Helmets. The total death toll from Syrian and Russian strikes since Nov. 27 had climbed to 56, including 20 children, the group added in a statement on X. The insurgents are a coalition of Turkey-backed mainstream secular armed groups along with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist group that has been designated a terrorist outfit by the U.S., Russia, Turkey and other states. Russian war bloggers reported on Sunday that Moscow had dismissed Sergei Kisel, the general in charge of its forces in Syria, after insurgents swept into Aleppo. Reuters has requested comment from the Russian defense ministry. In a joint statement, the United States, France, Germany, and Britain urged 'de-escalation by all parties and the protection of civilians and infrastructure to prevent further displacement and disruption of humanitarian access'. Leaving Aleppo Inside Aleppo city, streets were mostly empty and many shops were closed on Sunday as scared residents stayed at home. There was still a heavy flow of civilians leaving the city, witnesses and residents said. Rebel fighters waving the opposition flag drove through the city, Yusuf Khatib, a resident, told Reuters by phone. Some rebels took up positions on street intersections, he added. Ahmad Tutenji, a merchant in the affluent New Aleppo neighborhood, said he was surprised how quickly the army left. 'I am shocked at how they fled and abandoned us.' Abdullah al Halabi, a pensioner whose neighborhood was bombed near the central area of Qasr al Baladi, said people were terrified they would see a repeat of the Russian-led bombing that killed thousands of people before driving out rebels a decade ago. Syrian troops who had withdrawn from the city were now regrouping and reinforcements were also being sent to help in the counter-attack, army sources said. Aleppo had been firmly held by the government since a 2016 victory there, one of the war's major turning points, when Russian-backed Syrian forces besieged and laid waste to rebel-held eastern areas of what had been the country's largest city. Rebels said on Sunday they had pushed further south of Aleppo city and captured the town of Khansir in an attempt to cut the army's main supply route to Aleppo city. Rebel sources said they had also captured Sheikh Najjar estate, one of the country's major industrial zones. Reuters could not independently confirm the battlefield accounts. The war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced many millions, has ground on since 2011 with no formal end. Most heavy fighting halted years ago after Iran-backed militias and Russian air power helped Assad win control of all major cities. A lack of that manpower contributed to the speedy retreat of Syrian army forces in recent days, according to two army sources.

Are Jews still making Aliyah despite the war?	Eilon Gilad: People 'want to take part in re-establishing Israel and making sure that we have a good place to be' Israel can expect an even stronger wave of Aliyah now that the war is winding down, according to Eilon Gilad, the CEO of Belong, the first-ever private company promoting immigration to Israel. Speaking to ILTV News on Sunday alongside new immigrant Jessica Scalisi, Gilad said the work of his organization has become 'urgent' due to this new wave. 'People want to be a part' of the State of Israel, he told ILTV. 'They want to take part in re-establishing Israel and making sure that we have a good place to be.' In September, the Ministry of Aliyah and Integration reported that nearly 30,000 made Aliyah since war broke out, mostly from Western countries. The data also showed that since the start of the war, there was a significant increase in people inquiring about moving to the country. Scalisi, who moved to the country five years ago, said she could not have anticipated the recent security escalation. Despite the war, she still feels 'Israel is the best place in the world to be.' She added that it is no coincidence Israel became the Start-Up Nation, attributing this to the 'can-do' attitude of its people, which enables everyone to find their mission and purpose both in the country and globally. 'We saw how every Aliyah wave during [the country’s] history just made Israel stronger and better,' Scalisi said. 'This diversity of people coming from around the world is really what's so unique and makes us so strong.'

Behind the scenes of hostage negotiations: Cautious Israeli optim...	A proposed 60-day cease-fire is at the center of hostage negotiations, and while there is cautious optimism in Israel – bolstered by the Lebanon agreement and the upcoming U.S. leadership transition – Hamas remains resolute; 'If Hamas consents to symbolic exile, a deal could move forward. A diplomatic narrative will likely be crafted to justify ending the conflict' Israeli official says As reports surface of efforts to restart negotiations under U.S. pressure, cautious optimism is growing in Israel about a potential hostage deal. Four main factors are fueling this sentiment: The cease-fire model in Lebanon, which could influence Gaza; Hamas’ isolation and fears that the IDF will bolster its forces in Gaza after completing operations in Lebanon; Support from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for outgoing President Joe Biden’s initiative; and General war fatigue on all sides. In a shift from his previous statements, Trump has expressed a desire to see a hostage deal finalized before he returns to the White House on January 20. He has reportedly conveyed a message to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, urging Israel to end the conflict before the U.S. administration transitions. The negotiations are being spearheaded by the United States, with mediation from Qatar and Egypt. Despite Qatar’s earlier announcement of suspending its involvement, it remains a key player. The current proposal includes a 60-day cease-fire, with a limited Israeli presence in the Philadelphi Corridor. A source familiar with the negotiations noted that the challenge lies more with Israel than Hamas. A senior Israeli official suggested that a symbolic exile of some Hamas leaders from Gaza could enable progress. However, the official warned that Netanyahu would not allow a scenario that visually portrays Hamas regaining control of Gaza. Another Israeli official, privy to the discussions, said the deal would likely involve a 'diplomatic spin' to justify halting the war. The source added that Hamas is unlikely to compromise unless it secures guarantees for post-war reconstruction. 'This is a dynamic time. There’s potential for expanded possibilities, and we are evaluating the situation and acting accordingly,' the official said. Meanwhile, Netanyahu convened a meeting of senior ministers and negotiation team leaders to assess progress, raising speculation about developments behind the scenes. However, it is still too early to determine whether these efforts will culminate in a deal. Hamas and Israeli leaders weigh in Despite Israel's cautious optimism, Hamas leaders remain firm in their demands: A cessation of hostilities, the withdrawal of IDF forces from Gaza, guarantees for reconstruction, and an influx of humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, Fatah officials involved in talks with Hamas and Islamic Jihad about a post-conflict governance framework reported 'tentative progress' in Hamas’ willingness to establish a joint administration for Gaza. Israeli President Isaac Herzog expressed hope for an agreement. 'There are negotiations taking place behind the scenes, and it can be done. Now is the opportunity to bring about a meaningful change that will lead to a deal to free the hostages,' Herzog said during a meeting with the family of Edan Alexander, an American Israeli hostage whose spoke in a video released by Hamas on Saturday. 'Now is the time to bring meaningful change and achieve a hostage deal,' he said. 'We are negotiating with a bitter and cruel enemy whose sole purpose in releasing this video was to try to break our spirit. On the contrary – I believe this video has strengthened us.' Herzog reiterated his appeal to the international community: 'My call to the entire world, to Israel’s leadership, and to all mediators is this: the time is now. We want Edan home. We want everyone home urgently. We cry out for this every single day – now is the time to act.' Edan’s mother, Yael Alexander, shared her anguish and determination. 'This has been a sleepless night. Edan – his voice and the video replaying endlessly. You can see in the video that Edan is going through hell. His eyes are crying out, full of sorrow, but it gave me so much strength – Edan strengthened us with his call to us. 'We released this video so that everyone can see – Edan is alive, and many other hostages are alive. It’s time to act and free them,' she said. In New York, Edan’s father, Adi Alexander, gathered with hundreds of activists in New York's Central Park to call on current U.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump to act and bring about a deal for the release of all 101 hostages still held in Gaza. 'Edan's words in the video haunt me: 'Every day here feels like eternity.' No father should hear their child plead for their life like that,' Adi Alexander told the crowd. 'Edan believes in the strength of the U.S., and so do I, but strength means nothing if it is not combined with action.' 'I stand here after seeing my son alive for the first time in over a year.

Fragment from Yemeni missile falls in Jerusalem-area playground	A missile fragment launched from Yemen by the Houthis struck a playground in Tzur Hadassah, near Jerusalem; Residents say this is the fourth time there was a fall and no siren was activated, citing a similar incident in September when debris landed nearby Residents of Tzur Hadassah woke Sunday morning to the news that a fragment from a Houthi missile fired from Yemen had landed in a local playground. According to residents, this marks the fourth time the community near Jerusalem has experienced such incidents without a warning siren being activated. While some residents heard sirens from nearby Beit Shemesh, others only learned about the incident when the local council issued a statement. 'At 6:40 a.m., interception sounds were heard,' the council reported. 'A missile launched from Yemen was successfully intercepted without casualties or direct hits. Although the launch and interception occurred outside our area, a fragment fell in the Keshet playground. Damage to the fence and grass was minimal and is being addressed. Authorities, including Home Front Command representatives, are onsite, and updates will follow as needed.' David, a Tzur Hadassah resident, expressed frustration with the incident. 'This is the third or even fourth time fragments have fallen here without warning. We’ve seen them land in football fields, private gardens and on roads. We can’t rely on luck forever. While some nearby sirens can be heard faintly, the fact that no alarms go off in our community is unacceptable. I raised the issue with the council head this morning, but it’s unclear if it’s up to them or Home Front Command.' A similar event occurred on September 28, when large missile fragments landed on Route 375 near Tzur Hadassah and a nearby sports field after an interception, also without triggering sirens. 'Our luck will eventually run out,' one resident warned. In response to the recurring incidents, local council head Tomer Moskowitz met Sunday with Col. Yigal Dahan, the commander overseeing Tzur Hadassah for the Home Front Command, and his team. Moskowitz reiterated the need to expand the warning system to prevent unannounced missile fragments from falling in the area.

Israeli intelligence agency casts a net for whalers	The operations of Black Cube, a private intelligence agency, often fly under the radar; However, it recently exposed a case of governmental corruption that may save the lives of whales; The revelation of suspected corruption between a former Icelandic minister and a businessman, aimed at renewing whale hunting permits, has caused a political uproar in Iceland and derailed the plan The private intelligence agency Black Cube, founded by Dan Zorella and Dr. Avi Yanus, is staffed by former members of Israel's intelligence services and Israel’s illustrious foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad. Its most recent operation has shaken Icelandic politics. The firm has exposed intelligence implicating Jón Gunnarsson, a former minister holding Iceland's transportation, justice, and interior portfolios. And this time, their spying could end up saving countless whales. Espionage meets conservation On November 11, Gunnarsson posted on Facebook a lengthy post detailing how a Swiss businessman expressed interest in buying Icelandic real estate and quickly established rapport with Gunnarson’s son, Gunnar Bergmann. After two months of interaction and negotiations, they met for dinner at a Reykjavik hotel. There, the Swiss businessman turned the conversation to Jón Gunnarsson’s alleged involvement in renewing whale hunting permits to Iceland’s sole whaling company for another five years. Unbeknownst to Gunnar, the Swiss businessman recorded the conversations, which were released to Icelandic media. The tapes revealed plans to grant an exclusive whale hunting license to the company Hvalur and its owner, Kristján Loftsson, a prominent Icelandic whaling magnate. According to media in Iceland, it appears that Black Cube orchestrated the interactions, leveraging Gunnár's connections, recording incriminating evidence, and obtaining audio-visual proof of corruption and collusion between business magnate Loftsson and the senior politician Gunnarsson. A battle over whaling licenses The controversy mirrors another in 2009, when Iceland’s government renewed whale hunting licenses during an economic crisis. Once again, a transitional government following a coalition collapse sought to reauthorize whaling, despite public opposition, potentially tying the hands of the next administration, which had planned to curb or fully ban the practice. Gunnarsson, a staunch supporter of whaling, was appointed to serve as a special advisor to the ministry responsible for issuing these licenses and advanced related legislative processes. While Gunnarsson has long advocated for whaling, he denies involvement in the scandal and insists he wields no influence over licensing decisions. The population of whales, which can live over 80 years, has been decimated by brutal hunting methods involving explosive harpoons. These techniques have led to prolonged suffering and ecological damage, reinforcing the urgent need to end whaling. Iceland is one of only three countries in the world that still permits the practice. Government shake-up Following Black Cube’s revelations, interim Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson removed Gunnarsson from any government position related to whale hunting licenses. However, critics note that Benediktsson, who as agriculture minister appointed Gunnarsson, shares ties with the whaling industry. In June 2023, Iceland’s Green Party-led coalition suspended whaling licenses. Gunnarsson and his party protested vehemently, citing significant economic losses for Hvalur and the Icelandic economy. The coalition collapse in October set elections for November 30, creating a political vacuum exploited by the whaling industry. The scandal has revealed intricate quid-pro-quo relationships between politicians and business interests, highlighting glaring conflicts of interest. Dismissing all accusations against him, Gunnarsson has decried media sensationalism, questioning the legality of the recordings and evidence. 'After 18 years in politics, you develop a thick skin for scandals,' he told an Icelandic newspaper. However, he expressed outrage over his children being dragged into the affair. Black Cube's strategy After its controversial role in disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein's legal defense, Black Cube restructured, establishing an advisory committee to vet cases. 'Clients are categorized as red (off-limits), green (acceptable), or yellow (economically viable but sensitive),' explains Giora Eiland, one of 5 to 6 advisors on the committee. The advisory board holds veto power over cases, ensuring ethical scrutiny. Black Cube 'takes a single pro-bono case annually, and though the Iceland case wasn't that, we were incentivized by its human-interest aspect,' said Giora Eiland, one of the five or six consultants who sit on the company's advisory committee and hold absolute veto rights over any deal. Months ago, Icelandic and international environmental groups approached the firm to investigate suspected political-business corruption. 'And then we did what we do as a company in all projects,' explains Eiland. 'An in-depth and thorough open source investigation online, human-centric research into friends, family members, colleagues and look for exposure. Once we find it, we awake one of our cover companies, and deploy an operative fluent in the objects’ language and eliciting the intelligence of the object. Here, we knew it was Gunnar, who has a lot of self confidence and a tendency to want to impress you.' Black Cube’s swift operation was extremely successful. Gunnar was quick to divulge his family's deep ties to whaling politics and business, the deal closed between his father and the businessman, and how his family will be one the main beneficiaries of this ordeal. The intelligence exploded in Icelandic media, halting all whale hunting license discussions. 'It's a good feeling,' Eiland reflects. 'It was a successful operation, and no one in Iceland will be talking about whale hunting licenses for a while.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bymrqb5xyx	2024-12-01T12:22:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/20/yk14157864/yk14157864_0_42_1127_634_0_small.jpg
IDF forces Iranian plane suspected of carrying Hezbollah weapons ...	As part of enforcing the cease-fire agreement, the Israeli Air Force ordered an Iranian Mahan Air plane - suspected of carrying weapons for Hezbollah and destined for Syria - to turn around as fighter jets circled nearby, and the plane complied, returning east The IDF ordered an Iranian plane suspected of carrying weapons for Hezbollah and scheduled to land in Syria, to turn around and head eastward, according to a report on Sunday. The Israeli Air Force led the operation against the Iranian plane, with the key difference being the location – Syria, not Lebanon. Israeli fighter jets circled near the Iranian aircraft, in a threatening posture indicating they would shoot it down. A 'letter of assurances,' part of the cease-fire agreement with Lebanon, stated that 'the U.S. is committed to working with Israel to counter Iran's destabilizing activities in Lebanon, including preventing the transfer of weapons, proxies and other materials from Iranian territory.' Meanwhile, the IDF continued operating in Lebanon, citing 'actions that threatened Israel and violated the cease-fire agreement.' According to the IDF, paratroopers from the 98th Brigade identified armed terrorists near a church in southern Lebanon, which Hezbollah had used as a terrorist infrastructure. The soldiers fired and eliminated them. The slain terrorists were involved in ground defense, anti-tank and artillery operations in the region and had participated in fighting while using the church. After eliminating the terrorists, the IDF searched the area around the church and found a weapons cache in a pit.

Trump picks his in-law Massad Boulos to serve as adviser on Arab,...	Massad Boulos, a Lebanese American businessman and Trump adviser, has deep ties in the Middle East and U.S. Arab communities; His new role may shape Trump's policy, drawing on connections across Lebanon's political spectrum and efforts to engage Arab American voters U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday said Lebanese American businessman Massad Boulos would serve as a senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs. Trump announced the appointment on Truth Social. Boulos, the father-in-law of Trump's daughter Tiffany, met repeatedly with Arab American and Muslim leaders during the election campaign. It is the second time in recent days that Trump chose the father-in-law of one of his children to serve in his administration. On Saturday, Trump said he had picked his son-in-law Jared Kushner's father, real estate mogul Charles Kushner, to serve as U.S. ambassador to France. In recent months, Boulos campaigned for Trump to drum up Lebanese and Arab American support, even as the U.S.-backed Israel's military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon. It is the second time in recent days that Trump chose the father-in-law of one of his children to serve in his administration Boulos has powerful roots in both countries. His father and grandfather were both figures in Lebanese politics and his father-in-law was a key funder of the Free Patriotic Movement, a Christian party aligned with Hezbollah. His son Michael and Tiffany Trump were married in an elaborate ceremony at Trump's Florida Mar-a-Lago Club in November 2022, after getting engaged in the White House Rose Garden during Trump's first term. Boulos has been in touch with interlocutors across Lebanon's multipolar political world, three sources who spoke to him in recent months say, a rare feat in Lebanon, where decades-old rivalries between factions run deep. Particularly notable is his ability to maintain relations with Hezbollah, they say. The Iranian-backed Shi'ite Muslim party has a large number of seats in Lebanon's parliament and ministers in the government. Boulos is a friend of Suleiman Frangieh, a Christian ally of Hezbollah and its candidate for Lebanon's presidency. He is also in touch with the Lebanese Forces Party, a vehemently anti-Hezbollah Christian faction, the sources say and has ties to independent lawmakers. Aron Lund, fellow at the Century Foundation think tank, said Boulos was well placed to influence Trump's Middle East policy after playing a small but significant role in expanding Trump's appeal to Arab American and Muslim voters during the campaign. 'Boulos' Lebanese political past gives no real indication of a geostrategic or even national vision, but it demonstrates ambition and a set of political allies that will stand out in Trump's circle like a sore thumb,' Lund wrote. Michigan win Boulos, a billionaire with extensive business ties in Nigeria, was born in Lebanon, but moved to Texas as a teenager, where he attended the University of Houston, earned a law degree, and became a U.S. citizen. His son and Trump's daughter, whose mother is Trump's second wife, Marla Maples, met on the Greek island of Mykonos, at actor Lindsay Lohan's club, People Magazine reported in 2022. Trump's election win in Michigan came in part because of Boulos' help flipping some of the 300,000 Arab Americans and Muslims in the state who overwhelmingly supported Biden in 2020 but opposed Biden's policies in Israel, Gaza and Lebanon, Trump campaign officials and supporters told Reuters. 'Boulos played a big role in the outreach to Muslim voters,' said Rabiul Chowdhury, co-founder of Muslims for Trump. Beginning in September, the Trump campaign held weekly meetings in person and via Zoom with dozens of Arab American and Muslim civic leaders and business executives. Boulos spent weeks on the ground in Michigan, Pennsylvania, is, and other states with big Arab American and Muslim populations, assuring audiences in private lunches and dinners that tapped own connections to Lebanese American businessmen that Trump was committed to ending the wars in the Middle East. The Trump campaign spent tens of millions of dollars on the effort to mobilize Arab American and Muslim voters, Boulos told Reuters in an interview shortly after the election. Trump won endorsements from Muslim imams and the Muslim mayor of Hamtramck, another town near Detroit with a large Arab American population, as well as the large Bangladeshi community, and courted Iraqi Americans, Albanian Americans, and others. While the events on the ground in Lebanon played a factor, the economy did too. And conservative Arabs and Muslims were concerned about what they saw as the Democrats' far-left ideology,' including support of transgender rights, Boulos said. Boulos met with members of the 150,000-strong Albanian community in Michigan. Political ambitions? The new role could offer Boulos the kind of political clout he could not achieve in Lebanon. He had a brief run for Lebanon's parliament in 2018 alongside pro-Hezbollah candidates, but since then he has not consistently aligned himself with any particular party, sources in Lebanon said. He hails from a Greek Orthodox family. In Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system, that would cap his chances at a senior role in government at the level of deputy speaker of parliament. The post of president - the highest Christian role in the country - is reserved for Maronite Catholics. While he used to travel to Lebanon frequently, one of the sources said he has not visited in the last four years. Some people in Lebanon were hopeful about the prospects of having a friendly face in Trump's inner circle even before the announcement on Sunday.

Right-wing families of hostages oppose Netanyahu: 'Waiting for a ...	Relatives of hostages from the Tikva (Hope) Forum, who had previously supported the government's stance, are now voicing dissatisfaction; 'The offensive military operations at the start of the war have dwindled to almost nothing' they say Families of hostages represented by the Tikva (Hope) Forum have expressed mounting frustration and disappointment over the lack of progress in efforts to secure their loved ones' release, according to a report on Sunday. 'Three months have passed since we repeatedly appealed to the prime minister, yet our calls have gone unanswered. Three months of deafening silence,' they said. At a forum meeting, the families voiced their growing discontent, adopting a sharper tone in their criticism of Netanyahu's leadership. 'We stand here in unbearable pain, crying out for our loved ones, who are enduring the worst captivity - living in uncertainty, in darkness and without a shred of hope,' said one family member. Participants emphasized their belief that the government has abandoned the issue. 'There is no coherent plan, no vision and no clear answer to the most basic question: How do we bring our loved ones home?' they said. One relative of a hostage criticized the decline in military operations since the war's outset: 'The initial offensive momentum has diminished to almost nothing. There’s no pressure on Gaza, no new initiatives, and no leadership providing a clear direction. Meanwhile, we hear of no progress on the diplomatic front. Time is slipping away, and the hostages remain forgotten.' Another family member called for immediate action. 'We demand a decisive decision and an immediate strategy. The government must present both the public and the families of the hostages with a concrete plan for their release. Waiting for a miracle or relying on international political shifts is not a strategy. We demand an urgent meeting with the prime minister to hear how he intends to bring our loved ones home.

Despite cease-fire, Houthi rockets keep threatening Israel, expos...	While north remains quiet, alarms in central Israel warning of missile launch from Yemen are a reminder that other fronts remain active, and Israel lacks an exit strategy; Iran’s proxies in Yemen and Iraq may be keeping a lower profile, but their threats persist, while in Israel disappointment grows over international coalition’s reluctance to adopt tougher stance The alarms that blared Sunday morning across central Israel served as a stark reminder that, despite the cease-fire in Lebanon and a significant drop in rocket alerts, the war is far from over. Multiple fronts remain active, each presenting its own challenges. A ballistic missile launched from Yemen on Sunday during what had been a rare quiet day underscored a troubling reality – Israel lacks a comprehensive strategy to address these ongoing threats. For nearly 14 months, attempts to create such a strategy have stalled. Hopes now rest on the end of the Gaza war to bring stability to other fronts, though this remains uncertain. Criticism within Israel has also grown regarding the perceived inaction of the U.S. and the international coalition. Despite severe disruptions to shipping routes and Egypt’s economy, American efforts have been limited to intercepting drones and targeting weapons depots, leaving many questioning the West’s ability to confront these escalating threats. The missile attack from Yemen was a clear message from Iran’s regional proxies: As long as the fighting in Gaza continues, so will their attacks on Israel. Iran appears to have no interest in fully de-escalating, and the ongoing strikes from Yemen and Iraq may compel Israel to take more decisive action. This could include pressuring the U.S., where an administration change looms next month, to intensify its military efforts in the region. In a recorded statement last week before the Israeli Cabinet approved the Lebanon cease-fire, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the broader regional challenges. 'In Yemen, we struck the Houthis’ Hodeidah port with force – something the international coalition had not done before. In Iraq, we have successfully thwarted numerous drone attacks, but challenges remain,' he said. Netanyahu also targeted the 'head of the octopus' – Iran. 'We’ve destroyed significant parts of their air defense systems, missile production capabilities, and elements of their nuclear program. Preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons is my top priority. It’s crucial for Israel’s security and future,' he declared. Over the weekend, the IDF reported intercepting two drones approaching from the east before they entered Israeli airspace. However, the origins of the launches remain unconfirmed. Despite the cease-fire in Lebanon, the region is far from calm. Syrian rebels launched a surprise attack against the Assad regime, and Iranian-backed militias continue to insist their operations will persist. These groups, initially aligning their actions as 'support for Gaza,' have made it clear they do not plan to cease fire soon. Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, leader of Yemen’s Houthis, gave his first speech since the cease-fire last Thursday. Calling Lebanon’s 'victory' over Israeli aggression a historic triumph, he emphasized: 'We will not abandon Gaza. We will continue our operations on all fronts.' His comments were followed by nationwide protests organized by Houthi supporters. Pro-Iran militias in Iraq also distanced themselves from the Lebanon cease-fire, with groups like Kata’ib Hezbollah declaring that the cessation of fighting by Hezbollah would not impact their commitment to the Palestinian cause. They even vowed to escalate their attacks if Israel does not halt its actions in Gaza. Reports from Iraqi and international media suggest tensions between Iraq’s Prime Minister Mohammed Shia’ al-Sudani and the militias are growing, partly due to the risk of Israeli retaliation. Notably, while attacks from Yemen and intercepted drones persist, claims of responsibility from the Houthis and other militias have been less frequent, a marked shift from the daily announcements seen earlier in the conflict. Analysts suggest this is a strategic move to avoid provoking a larger Israeli response now that the Lebanese front has quieted. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to Danny Citrinowicz, a senior researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies and a former head of the Iran branch in military intelligence, several factors are driving the militias’ reduced visibility. These include fears of an Israeli focus on their activities post-Lebanon, escalating internal conflicts in Iraq, and U.S. pressure on Baghdad. However, Citrinowicz warns this does not mean the militias will stop. 'They aim to maintain a low profile, enough to show loyalty to the Palestinian cause without risking large-scale Israeli retaliation,' he explained. The Houthis officially claimed responsibility for Sunday’s missile attack, boasting that they had targeted a 'vital site near Jaffa' with their hypersonic Palestine-2 ballistic missile. For Israel, the growing threats from these fronts underscore the urgent need for a unified strategy before the situation spirals further out of control. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryowkqcm1g	2024-12-01T09:28:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/18/Hk1111CKOGye/Hk1111CKOGye_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Sunday night's discussion will also focus on developments in Syria, and the possibility of reaching a deal after cease-fire in north; National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan says video of American Israeli hostage Edan Alexander is a 'cruel reminder of Hamas' brutality' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold a special discussion Sunday evening devoted to the dramatic developments in Syria and to the issue of the hostages, following statements that now, after the cease-fire in the north, a deal for the hostages can be reached. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan made similar statements but admitted in an interview that 'We are not there yet.' In an interview with CBS' 'Meet the Press' on Sunday, Sullivan referred to the psychological terror video released by Hamas of American Israeli hostage Edan Alexander. 'That video was a cruel reminder of Hamas' brutality and of the fact that they are holding so many hostages from so many countries, including American citizens, including Americans like Edan. And we are doing everything we can to get those hostages home safely to their families,' he said. According to Sullivan in an interview with 'Face the Nation,' also on Sunday morning, 'I do think that Hamas is feeling the pressure. They’re feeling the pressure because one of their main partners in crime here, Hezbollah, has now cut a cease-fire deal, and they thought that Hezbollah would be with them till the end. They’re feeling the pressure, of course, because their top leader, Sinwar, has been killed. So, they may be looking anew at the possibility of getting a cease-fire and hostage deal.' 'And we are working actively with all of the key players in the region, including Israel and Turkey and Qatar and Egypt, to try to bring that about. In the coming days, conversations will be happening, even this very day, to try to make that happen as soon as possible,' he also said.

There is a renewed sense that this is possible, but we've been here before where we thought we were close, it didn't pan out. And so I'm not going to get ahead of myself or make any predictions or provide false hope. What I will say is, we're driving at this with everything we've got.

It was the second time in recent days that Trump chose the father-in-law of one of his children to serve in his administration. On Saturday, Trump said that he had picked his son-in-law Jared Kushner's father, real estate mogul Charles Kushner, to serve as U.S. ambassador to France.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkgnzgcmyg	2024-12-01T07:45:36-08:00	
Shin Bet says car ramming in Glilot last month that struck group ...	More than a month after the ramming incident near Glilot, in which Bezalel Carmi, 72, was killed and 36 others were injured, the Shin Bet confirmed for the first time that it was a terror attack. The police announced a few days after the incident that 'the suspicion that it was an attack is growing stronger,' but this was not determined officially. Ynet has now learned that the investigation is over, and the Shin Bet did confirm, as mentioned, that it was an attack. It will be recalled that the truck driver collided with a shuttle station near Glilot, where there were dozens of retirees who had come to tour the museum at the base. The driver was neutralized after pushing a police officer who was trying to get to him.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy4dyzcqkl	2024-12-01T07:11:17-08:00	
Terror cell eliminated in Jenin	Earlier Sunday with the direction of the ISA, an Israeli Air Force aircraft struck and eliminated a terrorist cell that carried out several shooting attacks against communities in the Gilboa area, according to the IDF. The head of the cell who was eliminated in the strike in Jenin, was Wael Lahluh, 31, a resident of Qabatiya. Lahluh carried out the shooting attack at the Mehola junction on August 11, 2024 - an attack in which Yonatan Deutsch was killed and another Israeli civilian was injured. After carrying out the attack, Lahluh continued to operate in Jenin, recruiting terrorists and planning to carry out additional terror attacks in the near future. Immediately after the strike, IDF soldiers conducted a targeted raid in the area and located three weapons on the bodies of the terrorists. Moreover, additional weapons parts, military vests and explosive materials were located.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj11wob9myl	2024-12-01T07:05:14-08:00

Rebels have captured Assad's palace in Aleppo; Syrian president s...	Two Iraqi militias loyal to Iran are considering deploying forces to Syria, framing their potential involvement as vital to protecting the 'resistance axis'; A militia spokesperson warned that Syria’s instability could spill into Iraq, justifying urgent action The rebels in Syria announced Sunday afternoon that they had taken over President Bashar Assad's palace in the city of Aleppo, which they occupied over the weekend for the first time since the beginning of the civil war. Assad himself promised in the afternoon to fight back and declared that 'terror only understands the language of power, and we will break it with it.' Sources in the Syrian army claim that the Syrian forces that were expelled from Aleppo over the weekend are now reorganizing and preparing for a counter-attack to regain control of the city. It is the first time since the Syrian Civil War erupted in 2011 that Bashar al-Assad’s regime has lost its grip on Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city. The Syrian opposition confirmed this dramatic shift on Sunday afternoon, marking a critical turning point in the conflict. Reports indicate the rebels, spearheading a surprise offensive against Assad’s forces, have seized key military installations in the city, including the military academy and other southern military colleges. Meanwhile, pro-Iranian militias in Iraq are reportedly contemplating intervention in Syria to bolster Assad’s regime as his grip on the region falters. The rebels’ sudden and coordinated assault began last Wednesday and coincided with the implementation of the cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) – a Sunni jihadist group that had been largely confined to Idlib province in northwest Syria – rebels rapidly advanced into the neighboring Aleppo region, capturing swaths of territory. Assad’s forces were unable to hold their positions, and by Saturday reports emerged that Aleppo was no longer under regime control. In recent years, Assad’s regime appeared to have stabilized, thanks to the backing of Russia and Iran, leaving rebel activity largely subdued. The Aleppo offensive marks the largest operation by anti-Assad forces in four years, raising international concerns, particularly in Israel, over the potential for non-conventional weapons to fall into jihadist hands. Over the past five days of intense fighting in northwest Syria, more than 300 people, including dozens of civilians, have reportedly been killed. By midday Sunday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based opposition monitoring group, confirmed Aleppo had fallen out of Assad’s control. Rami Abdul Rahman, the group’s director, told AFP the rebels now control almost the entire city, aside from a few Kurdish-held neighborhoods. 'This is the first time since the war began in 2011 that Assad has completely lost control of Aleppo,' he emphasized. Rebel sources later claimed that, in addition to capturing the military academy, they had also seized a Russian air defense system. Turkey’s concerns and Kurdish movements Regional actors are already recalibrating in response to the power shift. Iran, Assad’s staunch ally, has decried the rebel offensive as part of what it described as a 'Zionist-American satanic plot' to destabilize the region. On Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi traveled to Damascus in a show of solidarity, proclaiming Tehran’s unwavering support for the Syrian government. 'The Syrian army will once again defeat these terrorists, as it has in the past,' he declared before departing for Syria. Meanwhile, reports from the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby al-Jadeed suggest that two pro-Iranian Iraqi militias are deliberating whether to intervene in Syria to assist Assad in reclaiming Aleppo. A spokesperson for Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada ('Masters of Martyrs Battalion'), one of the militias, alleged that 'what is happening in Syria with American and Israeli backing is the second phase of the siege on Hezbollah in Lebanon.' He warned that the developments in Syria would inevitably spill over into Iraq, justifying potential intervention. 'We have fought for years in Syria, not to defend the regime, but to protect the resistance axis and the vital supply line connecting Lebanon, Iraq, Iran and Syria,' he explained. While no definitive decision has been made, militia representatives hinted that deployment could occur within days if deemed necessary. Turkey, another key stakeholder in northern Syria, is closely monitoring the situation. For years, Ankara has backed certain rebel factions against Assad, but its primary concern remains the strengthening of Kurdish groups near its border. Turkish security officials claimed on Sunday that rebel forces aligned with Ankara had thwarted an attempt by Kurdish militias to establish a corridor linking Kurdish-controlled areas in northeastern Syria to Tel Rifaat, an area northwest of Aleppo with strategic significance. Turkish sources alleged that Kurdish factions, including the PKK and YPG – both viewed as terrorist organizations by Ankara – sought to exploit the vacuum created by Assad’s retreat. Turkey views such moves as a direct threat to its national security. Assad’s allies downplay losses As the rebels consolidate their gains, Assad’s media apparatus has worked to downplay the significance of the developments. Lebanon’s Al-Mayadeen network, which is closely affiliated with Hezbollah, reported on Sunday that the Syrian army had already reclaimed several towns in northern Hama province. The network also dismissed claims that rebels had captured villages in the region. Meanwhile, Syria’s Ministry of Defense has urged citizens to rely exclusively on official channels for updates, underscoring the regime’s attempt to maintain a narrative of control. A civil war that reshaped the region The Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011 as part of the broader Arab Spring uprisings, has left an indelible mark on the Middle East. The conflict erupted following anti-Assad protests in the southern city of Daraa, which were met with a brutal crackdown by the regime. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: By 2015, Assad’s control had dwindled to a fraction of the country, and his government appeared on the verge of collapse. However, a decisive intervention by Russia, coupled with support from Iranian militias and Hezbollah, enabled Assad to regain control over most of Syria. In recent years, fighting has subsided. Rebels were largely confined to the Idlib region, and Assad’s grip on power seemed unshakable. Yet the Aleppo offensive has rekindled fears of renewed instability. The conflict has exacted a devastating toll, with over half a million people killed and millions displaced, many of whom have sought refuge abroad. Despite Assad’s apparent resurgence, the latest developments underscore that Syria’s war is far from over, and the balance of power remains precarious. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjoaeatmje	2024-12-01T06:24:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/01/By3W00st7Jg/By3W00st7Jg_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
US will not return nuclear weapons to Ukraine	The United States is not considering returning to Ukraine the nuclear weapons it gave up after the Soviet Union collapsed, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday. Sullivan made his remarks when questioned about a New York Times article last month that said some unidentified Western officials had suggested U.S. President Joe Biden could give Ukraine the arms before he leaves office. 'That is not under consideration, no. What we are doing is surging various conventional capacities to Ukraine so that they can effectively defend themselves and take the fight to the Russians, not (giving them) nuclear capability,' he told ABC. Kyiv inherited nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union after its 1991 collapse but gave them up under a 1994 agreement, the Budapest Memorandum, in return for security assurances from Russia, the United States and Britain.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkapag5qke	2024-12-01T06:17:06-08:00

German Navy successfully tests Israeli BlueWhale Drone Sub as Bal...	After a recent case of suspected Russian sabotage against internet cables in the Baltic Sea, the German Navy concluded testing the BlueWhale, an unmanned Israeli submarine that could help it protect critical undersea infrastructure The German Navy recently concluded a two-week evaluation of the BlueWhale autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), a cutting-edge system developed by the state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). The evaluation was conducted in the Baltic Sea by a 5.5-ton submarine equipped with a telescopic mast with radar and electro-optic systems. The AUV can perform complex tasks for several weeks, identify sea and land targets, and transmit data to command posts worldwide. The trials also highlight the growing defense partnership between Israel and Germany. BlueWhale’s evaluation follows other high-profile collaborations, including the recent Arrow missile air defense system deal, which reflects the strategic alignment between the two nations in addressing mutual security challenges. The German Navy partnered with IAI and ATLAS Elektronik for the trials, and the NATO Centre of Excellence for Operations supported the integration of the BlueWhale into the German Navy’s framework. The test comes after undersea internet cables in the Baltic Sea were physically cut, an act suspected of Russia-led sabotage. On November 18, two undersea telecommunications cables were severed, disrupting communications between Finland, Germany, Lithuania and Sweden. The incidents have raised concerns, and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius labeled them 'sabotage.' In light of this suspected undersea cable sabotage, the BlueWhale is reportedly strengthening the German Navy’s objectives. With its advanced monitoring capabilities and autonomy to operate for extended periods, the unmanned Israeli submarine can provide a critical tool for monitoring and protecting vital undersea infrastructure. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Germany’s defense policy has changed substantially; the government has planned to modernize its forces and meet NATO’s defense spending target of 2% of GDP. The country’s updated defense strategies, outlined in the 'German Navy Objectives for 2035 and Beyond,' reason that with the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO, the Baltic Sea must be integrated into NATO’s maritime security, a move that puts them in potential conflict with Russia. The German Navy’s efforts to strengthen its capacity in the Baltic Sea are a significant challenge for Russia, as the area is critical for Moscow’s ambitions. A more robust German naval presence – bolstered by advanced technologies like the BlueWhale and increased NATO coordination – undermines Russia’s ability to project power and operate covertly in the region. Such an enhanced military presence counters Russia’s hybrid threats, including cyber and physical sabotage, hallmarks of Putin’s tactics. IAI President and CEO Boaz Levy said in a statement that 'in addition to its intelligence-gathering capabilities, the BlueWhale system excels in detecting other submarines and covertly mapping mines on the seabed, using its advanced sonar systems, and is an important part of IAI’s range of maritime solutions, which include the protection of Economic Exclusion Zones, defensive and offensive system suites for marine vessels, and the management of the arena in which autonomous vessels are operating.' Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent conflict have been catalysts for German military spending, leading to substantial enhancements in military spending, reforms, a more proactive role in the defense of Europe, and support for NATO. However, Germany’s acquisition of Israeli defensive systems doesn’t put Israel on a collision course with Russia. Kobi Michael, a researcher at INSS and the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy, said that 'as long as Israel doesn’t supply Ukraine with weapons and mainly offensive weapons, I do not think that Russia can say something, especially when Russia supplies weapon to Hezbollah and aerial defense systems to Iran.' Similarly, Jeremy Issacharoff, Israel’s former ambassador to Germany, said that: 'Over the last decades, the Israel-Germany relationship has evolved into one of Israel’s most important strategic partnerships –second only to the United States. It’s remarkable considering diplomatic relations only began in 1965.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: While the Holocaust remains an ever-present historical factor between Israel and Germany, the relationship has matured into one of trust and cooperation, especially in defense and intelligence, the former ambassador highlighted. 'These deals weren’t about historical guilt – they were based on Germany’s recognition of Israeli technology as the best fit for their defense needs. Moreover, high-level visits between Israeli and German leaders increased significantly. This wasn’t just Germany supporting Israel; it was Israel committing to Germany’s security as well,' Issacharoff added. -This article is written by Nathan Klabin and reprinted with permission from The Media Line >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rydy00eq71e	2024-12-01T06:13:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/05/08/r1C9ko8Nn/r1C9ko8Nn_0_0_825_525_0_small.jpg

Gaza cease-fire talks could advance, Saar, Herzog say as Hamas of...	Foreign Minister says there is new flexibility on both sides; Herzog says negotiations taking place behind the scene; Qatari outlet says Egyptian proposal gives Israel broad role to survey Rafah crossing after Hamas hints agreement to gradual IDF withdrawal Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said there are indications that cease-fire talks with Hamas may move forward and that there may be more flexibility on both sides to reach a deal in Gaza. Saar spoke at a conference held by the Israel Hayom. 'I think we will know in the coming days,' he said. 'The basic principle is that Hamas cannot rule over Gaza, but we are committed to advancing the release of hostages,' he said. President Issac Herzog said there were negotiations currently behind the scenes and there was now a chance to bring the hostages home. Herzog met with the family of Edan Alexander who was seen in a psychological warfare video posted by Hamas on Saturday, calling on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. president-elect Donald Trump to bring about his release and that of the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. 'Now is the time,' Herzog said. 'My call is to the entire world, the leadership in Israel and all the countries mediating in the negotiations.' Earlier, the Saudi owned UK-based Asharq al-Awsat newspaper cited Palestinian sources who said Hamas was more willing to discuss a gradual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza after a similar deal was agreed in the war between Israel and Hezbollah. The sources said a delegation of Hamas officials that were visiting Cairo to meet with Egyptian intelligence chief Major General Hassan Rashad were in fact already involved in a new round of talks with Egyptian and American mediation and were discussing the governing of Gaza after the war. According to the sources, Hamas would agree to the Palestinian Authority control of the Rafah border crossing to Egypt in exchange for the return of displaced Gazans to their homes in the northern part of the Strip. Hamas was also willing to agree to a committee rule over the Strip, the Palestinian sources told the paper. That suggested was raised in the past and included a commission of professionals that would administer Gaza under the auspices of the PA and take responsibility over the distribution of humanitarian aid and prepare a plan for the rebuilding that would be required after the destruction caused by the war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had repeatedly rejected any role played by the PA in post-war Gaza. The Qatari based Al Arabi Al Jadeed reported on a different Egyptian proposal being discussed. According to the report a committee of regional mediating countries would be established to oversee a 60-day transitional period like that one agreed on in the cease-fire deal with Hezbollah. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Egyptian proposal, the report said includes a broad role for Israel in overseeing the Rafah crossing, using surveillance equipment at every stage of the crossing process – in exchange for large amounts of aid being delivered into the Strip. According to the paper, Israel and Egypt remain in disagreement over security arrangements along the Philadelphi Corridor. 'Egypt rejects Israel's unilateral steps taken there, including positioning surveillance cameras positioned to see into the Sinai desert,' the report said. According to the outlet, Israel has begun building observation towers along the narrow corridor and has installed cameras and other advanced surveillance equipment. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjmpkakm1g	2024-12-01T03:54:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/01/HkNy116tX1g/HkNy116tX1g_0_132_1280_720_0_small.jpg

F*ck Israel, nobody likes you': Jewish students accosted on Lond...	A London school bus carrying Jewish students was targeted by teens hurling stones and shouting slurs, including 'F*** Israel'; Police are investigating the incident as a potential hate crime, calling the attack 'completely unacceptable' A bus carrying Jewish students on their way home from school was attacked by a group of teenagers who threw stones at the vehicle while shouting, 'F*** Israel.' London police confirmed to the Daily Mail that officers are investigating the incident as a 'potential hate crime.' The students involved attend the Jewish Free School (JFS) in Kenton, North London. An eyewitness told the Jewish Chronicle that when the buses stopped last Wednesday on Edgware Road, a large group of teenagers from another school began throwing large stones at one of the buses. Following the attack, four teenagers boarded one of the buses, hurling curses and making antisemitic remarks toward the Jewish students. The eyewitness reported that the attackers insulted the Jewish children: 'They were also swearing at us, saying, 'F*ck Israel, nobody likes you. F*ck off you b*tches.' A Jewish bystander who witnessed the incident said that some students fled the bus while others ducked for cover. 'They were completely terrified,' he said. He also noted that the attackers filmed the incident on their phones. According to the Daily Mail, the substitute bus driver did not report the incident immediately. Instead, it was a parent of one of the affected children who contacted the police. The London Metropolitan Police stated: 'Officers in Barnet are investigating a potential hate crime after a school bus was targeted on High Street, Edgware. Stones were thrown at the bus before a group of other students got on and made antisemitic remarks towards those on board. Officers from the safer transport team have spoken to the victims involved, as well as their parents, and enquiries are ongoing.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Lorraine Busby-McVey, Borough Commander for Barnet’s neighborhood policing team, described the incident as deeply concerning: 'This was a distressing incident for those on the bus and the behavior of the individuals responsible is completely unacceptable. There is no place for hate crime either here or across the rest of London, and a thorough investigation is underway.' Despite the seriousness of the incident, no arrests have been made so far. Transport for London (TfL) also addressed the attack in a statement: 'We are deeply concerned to hear about this incident and fully support the police investigation. No-one should ever have to fear or experience abuse when using our network.' The statement continued, 'We take a zero-tolerance approach to all forms of hate crime, and work with the police to pursue anyone who is abusive to our customers or staff. Alongside the bus operator, Uno, we are supporting the police with their investigation and are supplying footage from the CCTV cameras, which all buses are equipped with.

Watch: Russian police storm Moscow gay nightclubs	Local law enforcement carry out government-instructed crackdown on 'LGBTQ+ propaganda' after supreme court bans movement in country Russian police raided several bars and nightclubs across Moscow on Saturday as part of the government’s crackdown on 'LGBTQ+ propaganda,' state media reported. Smartphones, laptops and video cameras were seized, while clubgoers had their documents inspected by officers, Russia’s Tass news agency said, citing sources in law enforcement. The raids come exactly a year since Russia’s Supreme Court ruled that the 'LGBTQ+ movement' should be banned as an 'extremist organization.' Its decision followed a decades-long crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights in Russia, where President Vladimir Putin has touted 'traditional family values' as a cornerstone of his quarter-century in power. Footage shared on social media appeared to show partygoers being ordered by police to lie on the floor as officers moved through Moscow’s Arma nightclub. The capital’s Mono bar was also targeted, Russian media reported. In a post on Telegram on Saturday, the club’s management didn’t directly reference an incident with law enforcement, but wrote, 'Friends, we’re so sorry that what happened, happened. They didn’t find anything forbidden. We live in such times, but life must go on.' Police also detained the head of the 'Men Travel' tour agency on Saturday under anti-LGBT laws, Tass reported. The news agency said that the 48-year-old was suspected of preparing a trip for 'the supporters of nontraditional sexual values' to visit Egypt over Russia’s New Year’s holidays. The raids mirror the concerns of Russian activists who warned that Moscow’s designation of the 'LGBTQ+ movement' as 'extremist' — despite it not being an official entity — could see Russian authorities crack down at will on groups or individuals. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Other recent laws have also served to put pressure on those that the Russian government believes aren’t in line with the country’s 'traditional values.'

The Kremlin leader also approved legislation that outlaws the spread of material that encourages people not to have children. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkd5x6fmjg	2024-12-01T02:30:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/01/SJDXgsKm1l/SJDXgsKm1l_0_13_248_139_0_small.jpg

Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir says working to convince Netanyahu; says establishing settlements in Gaza is a good idea but is not enough Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said on Sunday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was beginning to show willingness to promoting Palestinian migration out of Gaza. Speaking in an interview with Army Radio, Ben-Gvir said the idea of Jewish settlements in Gaza was a welcomed one. 'After all we must remember that this could be the greatest punishment for what was done to us on Oct. 7,' he said. 'The only times we have won over our enemies was when we took territory from them. Conquering Gaza is definitely an idea, but I must admit it would not be enough for me. I want to encourage migration and I think Palestinians should be able to leave willingly to 'their countries.' He said he saw on television a man in Gaza begging to be allowed to leave. 'I think there are many like him. I am working hard to convince the prime minister that this should happen and am beginning to see some openness. I hope he will eventually understand that is the only way,' Ben-Gvir said.

Assad's nightmare: Meet Tahrir al-Sham leader, Abu Mohammad al-Ju...	North western Syria is now entirely out of President Assad's control, mostly to the efforts of a Sunni coalition known as Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, a Salafist Jihadi organization headed by Abu Mohammad al-Julani, an elusive figure who broke contact with both ISIS and Al Qaeda to take his group in a new direction When discussing the Syrian 'rebels' currently engaged in combat against President Bashar al-Assad’s regime and its supporters, the reference is to a diverse array of groups with varying allegiances, many of which have evolved over the prolonged civil war. Among these, Jabhat al-Nusra, initially established during the early stages of the conflict as al-Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate, played a prominent role in the fight against Assad. Over time, the group demonstrated its ability to control territory and later rebranded itself as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham in 2016, claiming to sever ties with al-Qaeda. In 2017, it merged with other factions to form Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), now a coalition of Sunni rebel groups. On Saturday, the Syrian newspaper Al-Watan, citing 'special sources' from Idlib, reported that 'a central headquarters of Jabhat al-Nusra in Idlib was attacked, with indications that al-Julani was inside the building.' According to the report, the targeted site was heavily secured, with strict measures in place preventing civilians and even members of the organization from approaching. It remains unclear whether al-Julani was killed in the attack. Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (loosely translated as 'The Organization for the Liberation of the Levant'), known internationally by its acronym HTS, is currently the leading faction fighting against the Syrian regime and pro-Iranian militias. Exploiting the weaknesses of the Shiite-Iranian axis, HTS has rapidly expanded its territorial control, capturing numerous villages in the Idlib, Aleppo, and Hama regions in coordination with other opposition forces. The current military commander of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, Abu Mohammad al-Julani, previously served as the Emir of Jabhat al-Nusra from 2012 to 2016. His real identity remains a subject of speculation, with some sources identifying him as Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa and others as Osama al-Wahdi. Reports about his life are contradictory, adding to his enigmatic reputation. According to Arab media, al-Julani was born in either 1981 or 1982 in Deir ez-Zor, Syria, and grew up in the Idlib region. He initially studied medicine but dropped out and joined al-Qaeda in Iraq in 2003 following President Bush's invasion, where he became close to the infamous Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the group’s leader. After the latter's assassination in 2006, al-Julani relocated to Lebanon but later returned to Iraq, where he was detained by U.S. forces and released in 2008. Following his release, al-Julani resumed his activities with the 'Islamic State of Iraq' under Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In August 2011, amid protests against Assad, al-Julani was sent by al-Qaeda to Syria to establish a branch of the organization. In 2012, he founded Jabhat al-Nusra, calling on Syrians to wage jihad against the Assad regime. However, al-Julani later rejected an attempt by al-Baghdadi to merge the Islamic State of Iraq with Jabhat al-Nusra, instead pledging exclusive allegiance to Ayman Al-Zawahiri, then-head of al-Qaeda, who himself was assassinated in a US strike in late of July of 2022. Over time, Jabhat al-Nusra emerged as one of the most powerful armed factions in Syria. The group seized control of Idlib in northwestern Syria, imposing strict governance on the local population. Critics accuse al-Julani of building an economic empire at the expense of civilians, benefiting from revenues from border crossings, control over oil companies, and dominance in agriculture and trade. In recent months, protests have erupted in the Idlib region, with demonstrators demanding al-Julani’s resignation. In 2016, Jabhat al-Nusra rebranded itself as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, claiming to distance itself from al-Qaeda. The following year, it merged with other groups to form Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham. Despite these changes, the United States and the United Nations continue to classify HTS as a terrorist organization. Al-Julani has drawn ideological distinctions between Jabhat al-Nusra and the Islamic State, stating, 'We reject the caliphate they declare and view it as illegitimate because it was established on invalid foundations.' HTS, which has taken the lead in the current surprise offensive against Assad’s forces, has long been criticized for its extremist activities. Al-Julani and HTS were early on responsible for deadly bombings, vowed to attack Western forces, confiscated property from religious minorities, and deployed a 'religious police' to enforce conservative dress codes for women.

The loss of Aleppo to the rebels, Zisser noted, represents a significant blow due to the city’s size and economic importance. He explained that Assad now relies heavily on the support of his allies but warned that airstrikes alone would not suffice to repel the rebels: 'If the Russians, Iranians, and Hezbollah do not come to his aid, this could create very negative momentum for Assad. Ultimately, he could find himself confined to Damascus.' Regarding the implications for Israel, Zisser argued, 'This conflict is beyond our scope. Israel should avoid direct involvement in a war in another country. Instead, we should seize the opportunity to strike at Iranian, Hezbollah, and Shiite militia forces operating in Syria.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hklcaqfqje	2024-12-01T00:55:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/30/BJJ38yFmJg/BJJ38yFmJg_0_0_1024_576_0_small.jpg

Trump nominates fierce critic of FBI, as new chief	Kashyap Patel, a known Trump loyalist who served as Chief of Staff at the Department of Defense during Trump’s first term; in a recent interview he called on the bureau HQ to be dismantled, turned into deep state museum On Saturday night, President-elect Donald Trump announced that Kashyap (Kash) Patel, who previously served as Chief of Staff at the U.S. Department of Defense during Trump’s first term, will be appointed as the next FBI Director. Trump made the announcement on his social media platform, Truth Social. According to Trump, 'Kash is an excellent lawyer, investigator, and an ‘America First’ fighter who has dedicated his career to exposing corruption, defending justice, and protecting the American people. He played a crucial role in exposing the Russian hoax and stands as a defender of truth, accountability, and the constitution.' The president-elect further stated, 'Kash did outstanding work during my first term, where he served as Chief of Staff at the Department of Defense, Deputy Director of National Intelligence, and Senior Director for Counterterrorism at the National Security Council. Kash has also participated in over 60 jury trials.' Trump added, 'This FBI will put an end to America’s growing crime epidemic, dismantle immigrant criminal gangs, and combat the evil scourge of human and drug trafficking along the border. Kash will work under our great Attorney General, Pam Bondi, to restore loyalty, courage, and integrity to the FBI.' CNN reported that Patel has been highly critical of the FBI in the past. In a podcast interview in September, Patel called for dismantling the agency’s Washington headquarters and turning it into a 'Deep State museum.' He also mocked the FBI during an interview on 'The Shawn Ryan Show' in relation to the search warrant executed in 2022 at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, which had led to charges against the president-elect for retaining classified documents. A judge later dismissed the charges against Trump. Patel has publicly praised Israel's intelligence capabilities on numerous occasions and has called for the United States to stand 'shoulder to shoulder' with Israel, which he described as 'our number one ally.' Following the 'pager' operation in Lebanon, he told Fox News, 'What the Israelis did was genius. Hamas is looking at what they did, and they are surely trembling. They must be terrified right now at how brilliant the Israelis are in executing this. This was planned for so long—Israel doesn’t play one-dimensional chess.' 'I’ve worked with Israeli intelligence services for years,' Patel shared. 'This is part of a multi-system approach, a strategy of thinking one, two, even seven steps ahead. They mapped out every possible outcome, and for the first time in the war, Iran is likely saying to itself, ‘They might actually defeat us.’' After Iran’s attack on Israel, Patel placed blame on President Biden, accusing him of 'allowing Iran to return to the international stage and resume business as usual.' He added, 'Israel’s capabilities are extraordinary, but they cannot defeat Iran alone—it’s too big a machine. We need to stand shoulder to shoulder, side by side with Israel against Iran. And when Trump returns to power, we will shut down the machine that funnels money to Iran. We won’t have hostages in the hands of Hamas, Iran, or Hezbollah. America needs to wake up and prioritize Israel. We need to end this war, bring Israeli and American hostages home, and stand with our number one ally—and that’s exactly what Trump will do.'

Patel has been involved in several controversial incidents, including a statement last year in which he said he would 'go after' politicians and journalists perceived as enemies of Trump. During Trump’s first term, senior security officials reportedly viewed Patel with hostility, regarding him as an unstable individual who was excessively eager to please Trump. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1lak9k7jg	2024-11-30T23:39:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/01/ByM0LOFQyg/ByM0LOFQyg_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
Hamas willing to discuss gradual IDF withdrawal from Gaza, report	Saudi owned UK-based outlet cites Palestinian sources who say the terror group is also willing to allow PA control of Rafah border crossing in exchange for return of Gazans to the north of the Strip Hamas was more willing to agree a cease-fire deal that would include a gradual withdrawal of IDF troops from the Gaza Strip, ahead of a new round of talks with Egyptian and American mediators, the UK based Saudi owned, Asharq al-Awsat reported on Sunday citing Palestinian sources. Hamas had previously demanded a complete withdrawal from the Strip and an end to the war before agreeing to a deal that would release hostages held in Gaza since the Oct. 7 massacre. The terror group was reportedly also willing to allow the Palestinian Authority (PA) to assume responsibility for the Rafah border crossing to Egypt in exchange for the return of displaced Gazans to their homes in the northern areas of the Strip. The Biden administration was seeking to advance a deal before the new Trump presidency begins late in January 2025. President-elect Donald Trump appears interested in a deal as well after he received the Israeli assessment that half of the 101 hostages were still alive. Hamas in an act of psychological warfare on Saturday, posted a video of American hostage, Edan Alexander, who serves in the IDF, appealing to Trump to work for his and the other hostages' release. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said repeatedly that Israel would agree to a cease-fire in the war against Hamas in Gaza, but not to the end of the war.

Syrian president vows to retaliate for rebel offensive, with Russ...	Islamist extremists opposing Assad regime overpower Syrian military in key points in north of country Syrian president Bashar al-Assad vowed to defeat the insurgent offensive launched against his military forces in the Idlib province in northern Syria. According to a report in the state news agency SANA, Assad spoke with UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed and said his troops 'continue to defend its territorial integrity against all terrorists and their supporters and is capable, with the help of its allies, of defeating and eliminating them — no matter how severe their terrorist attacks.' SANA reported that bin Zayed affirmed Abu Dhabi’s support for Syria. The militias launched a surprise assault against Assad’s regime last Wednesday, marking the biggest military push taken by the militant force in the country in four years. The rebels reportedly took advantage of the weakened state of Assad's allies in the civil war, especially Hezbollah — which had suffered significant blows from Israel before the two sides agreed to a cease-fire. Reports indicate that Assad's forces were caught off guard by the rebels, who launched their attack from their last major stronghold in Idlib Province in northwestern Syria. The surprise offensive began last Wednesday, coinciding with the enactment of a cease-fire in Lebanon. The assault was being led by several rebel factions, spearheaded by the jihadist group Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham and in coordination with Turkish-backed rebel forces. Fighting erupted within Aleppo on Friday, Syria’s second-largest city and a strategic and symbolic stronghold. Reports suggested the rebels had taken control of most of the city by Friday. This marks a dramatic and highly symbolic victory for the rebels. Aleppo, a city with a history spanning thousands of years and home to 2.3 million people before the war, was the rebels' main stronghold in the previous decade. They captured it in 2012 but were forced to retreat in 2016 following a brutal bombardment campaign by Assad's forces and the Russian air force, which flattened large parts of the city. On Saturday, reports emerged that the rebels had also seized Aleppo's international airport. In dramatic footage, rebels were seen celebrating in the city’s streets, including near its historic citadel, removing regime symbols and Assad posters. It appears their advance has faced little significant resistance so far, with Syrian officials admitting Assad’s forces had retreated from several areas. Assad’s government officially declared a 'reorganization' of its forces to prepare for a counteroffensive to reclaim lost territory. Alongside the main offensive on Aleppo, the rebels have completed their capture of all of Idlib Province — most of which was already under their control — and pushed south toward Hama. Although Assad's forces denied reports of a retreat from the area, the rebels appeared to have made advances. Russia has intervened to support Assad with a series of airstrikes conducted by its fighter jets operating from Latakia. Russian aircraft bombed Aleppo for the first time since 2016. The clashes have so far claimed over 327 lives, primarily from Assad’s forces and the rebels, though the toll includes dozens of civilians. In his first response to the surprise attack, Assad vowed that Syria is capable of defeating the rebels. According to the Syrian state news agency SANA, Assad spoke with UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed, stressing that 'Syria continues to defend its territorial integrity against all terrorists and their supporters and is capable, with the help of its allies, of defeating and eliminating them — no matter how severe their terrorist attacks.' The statement added that bin Zayed affirmed Abu Dhabi’s support for Syria. Should Israel be concerned? The main global concern of the attack is the potential for renewed chaos in Syria after years of apparent stabilization and Assad's reintegration into the Arab world. Renewed instability could empower extremist groups like the Islamic State. In Europe, where the effects of the massive migrant crisis from the peak of the Syrian civil war are still felt, leaders are particularly wary of facing another wave of refugees. Israel is closely monitoring developments, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu holding an unusual discussion on the matter back on Friday. Ynet’s Military and security correspondent Ron Ben-Yishai noted that in the short term, the situation might actually benefit Israel's security. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Assad, weakened and losing control, is unlikely to provoke confrontations with Israel and will probably exercise caution regarding Iranian efforts to deliver aid to Hezbollah through Syrian territory.

What is the cost of immigration to Israel and how best to prepare...	Eilon Gilad, CEO of Belong the first private company that offers guidance and assistance for new immigrants, recommends learning Hebrew ahead of move New immigrants to Israel face many challenges when they decide on the move, some are financial and others involve assimilating successfully to the job market. Eilon Gilad, CEO of Belong, the first private company set up to provide guidance and assistance to new immigrants explains how to make Aliya easier. 'It is important to learn Hebrew while abroad,' he says. 'It’s no secret that our enemies wish for the eradication of the State of Israel, and they do this even outside the borders of the battlefield,' says Eilon Gilad, CEO of Belong. 'Our enemies are using psychological warfare in an attempt to break our spirit and make us run away from here. Our answer must be decisive - we must encourage and bring waves of immigration to Israel. The equation is simple: if they want us to leave Israel, we will do the exact opposite - we will bring more Jews and create a wave of Aliyah that will strengthen Israeli society.' In April 2024, about six months after the outbreak of the war, the first impact company that encourages Aliyah and assists in integration was launched- Belong. The company, owned by entrepreneur and businessman Gilad Ramot, is the first private organization in Israel that encourages Aliyah. The company’s goal is to improve the Aliyah and Integration process in Israeli society. Is it financially feasible? Belong believes so. Through an agent, the company offers: • Assistance in handling the process, exercising rights, and using them. • The integration process, managing Israeli bureaucracy, exhausting the rights they deserve, integrating into the labor market, and overcoming the challenges of culture and language. 'We build communities to ensure that everyone who comes to Israel feels they belong, and even provide a concierge service to those who want to facilitate their integration into daily life in Israel,' says Gilad. What are the significant obstacles that the Olim face? 'Finding a job. It may take time for Olim to find a suitable job in Israel, especially if they don’t speak Hebrew. The job market is reserved only for significant incomes. Sometimes, you also need to complete your education or undergo professional training in required adaptions to the Israeli labor market. Also, linguistic differences can be a barrier in various jobs. However, there are many jobs in Israel where a foreign language as a mother tongue may actually be a significant advantage.' In addition to the cost of plane tickets, there are also shipping costs: Furniture, personal equipment, etc., which can amount to even 5,000 dollars - depending on the amount of luggage. The average rent in Israel is very expensive and stands at about NIS 4,500 per month (about $1,300), compared to the average rent in the US, which is estimated at about $1,200. The average rent in Europe is even lower at $900. Of course, these are general numbers that vary according to the location of the apartment, its size, and the year of construction, but they certainly give a general picture of the cost of living in Israel.

US blames Assad's reliance on Russia, Iran for loss of Aleppo con...	White House National Security Council spokesperson says U.S. had nothing to do with the Hayat Tahir Al Shams (HTS) offensive; Russia vows support for Damascus regime The United States on Saturday said Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad lost control of Aleppo because of his reliance on Russia and Iran. Syria's 'reliance on Russia and Iran,' along with its refusal to move forward with a 2015 peace process outlined by the UN Security Council, 'created the conditions now unfolding,' National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said in a statement. 'At the same time, the United States has nothing to do with this offensive, which is led by Hay'at Tahir al-Sham (HTS), a designated terrorist organization.' The Syrian army said on Saturday dozens of its soldiers had been killed in a major attack led by Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham rebels who swept into the city of Aleppo, forcing the army to redeploy in the biggest challenge to President Bashar al-Assad in years. Russia's Defense Ministry said its air force had carried out strikes on Syrian rebels in support of the country's army, Russian news agencies reported. The strikes followed what was the boldest rebel assault for years in a civil war where front lines had largely been frozen since 2020. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, once known as the Nusra Front, is designated a terrorist group by the U.S., Russia, Turkey and other states. Assad is a close Moscow ally. In Washington, the White House National Security Council said it was closely monitoring the situation and had been in contact with regional capitals over the last 48 hours. The war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced many millions, has ground on since 2011 with no formal end, although most major fighting halted years ago after Iran and Russia helped Assad's government win control of most land and all major cities. Aleppo had been firmly held by the government since a 2016 victory there, one of the war's major turning points, when Russian-backed Syrian forces besieged and laid waste to rebel-held eastern areas of what had been the country's largest city. 'I am a son of Aleppo, and was displaced from it eight years ago, in 2016. Thank God we just returned. It is an indescribable feeling,' said Ali Jumaa, a rebel fighter, in television footage filmed inside the city. Acknowledging the rebel advance, the Syrian army command said insurgents had entered much of Aleppo. After the army said it was preparing a counterattack, airstrikes targeted rebel gatherings and convoys in the city, the pro-Damascus newspaper al-Watan reported. One strike caused casualties in Aleppo's Basel square, a resident told Reuters. Images filmed on Saturday showed people posing for photos on a toppled statue of Bassil al-Assad, late brother of the president. Fighters zipped around the city in trucks and milled around in the streets. A man waved a Syrian opposition flag as he stood near Aleppo's historic citadel. The Syrian military command said militants had attacked in large numbers and from multiple directions, prompting 'our armed forces to carry out a redeployment operation aimed at strengthening the defense lines in order to absorb the attack, preserve the lives of civilians and soldiers'. The rebels also took control of Aleppo airport, according to a statement by their operations room and a security source. Two rebel sources also said the insurgents had captured the city of Maraat al Numan in Idlib province, bringing all of that area under their control. The fighting revives the long-simmering Syrian conflict as the wider region is roiled by wars in Gaza and Lebanon, where a truce between Israel and the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah took effect on Wednesday. With Assad backed by Russia and Iran, and Turkey supporting some of the rebels in the northwest where it maintains troops, the offensive has brought into focus the conflict's knotted geopolitics. Fighting in the northwest had largely abated since Turkey and Russia reached a de-escalation agreement in 2020. Russian, Turkish ministers talk Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov held a phone call with his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan, discussing the situation in Syria, Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Saturday. 'Both sides expressed serious concerns at the dangerous development of the situation,' the ministry said. They agreed it was necessary to coordinate joint actions to stabilize the situation in the country. Turkish security officials had said on Thursday that Ankara had prevented operations which opposition groups wanted to organize, in order to avoid further tensions in the region. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told Lavrov in a phone call that the rebel attacks were part of an Israeli-U.S. plan to destabilize the region, Iranian state media said. The Syrian Civil Defense, a rescue service operating in opposition-held parts of Syria, said in a post on X that Syrian government and Russian aircraft carried out airstrikes on residential neighborhoods in rebel-held Idlib, killing four civilians and wounding six others. The Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), which spearhead the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces that control much of northeastern and eastern Syria and have long had a foothold in Aleppo, widened their control in the city as government troops left, a senior YPG source said.

US general takes helm in Lebanon cease-fire as Syrian battles esc...	Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers arrives in Beirut to lead international team enforcing truce, joined temporarily by Biden adviser Amos Hochstein; as Hezbollah challenges deal, Israel hopes Syria's escalating conflict will shift focus to Assad regime Hezbollah’s attention appears to be shifting to Syria as rebel forces make dramatic advances, potentially diverting the terrorist group's focus from violating agreements with Israel to defending Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Israeli officials have characterized the development as a short-term positive, especially given Hezbollah’s recent efforts to challenge the Lebanon cease-fire framework. In light of the evolving situation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a special security meeting Friday night to discuss the implications of the Syrian conflict and the enforcement of the Lebanon cease-fire agreement. 'This is something we need to monitor closely to see how it unfolds,' Israeli officials said. 'It doesn’t necessarily impact us in the short term, but any instability in a neighboring country could eventually affect us. That said, there may also be opportunities for change here.' Ynet military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai noted that in the near term, the developments could benefit Israel’s security. Assad, weakened by the ongoing conflict, is unlikely to provoke Israel and may exercise caution in allowing Iran to use Syrian territory to supply Hezbollah. However, Ben-Yishai warned that the longer-term outlook is concerning, as the Sunni rebels are jihadists no less dangerous than the Iranian-backed Shiite groups. Despite the upheaval in Syria, Hezbollah’s cease-fire violations continued over the weekend. The IDF reported on Saturday targeting a military vehicle in southern Lebanon, near a Hezbollah missile production site, in response to these breaches. The international enforcement mechanism overseeing the Lebanon cease-fire agreement is expected to ramp up operations later this week. Until then, Israel has maintained aggressive enforcement. 'Every violation will be met with significant enforcement, as is currently the case,' a senior Israeli official said. The enforcement framework is headed by U.S. Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers, who previously served as the head of special operations at U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). Jeffers arrived in Beirut last Wednesday, coinciding with the cease-fire’s implementation. He co-chairs the monitoring and enforcement mechanism alongside Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to President Joe Biden who helped broker the agreement. Hochstein will serve as the civilian co-chair until a permanent civilian representative is appointed. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The mechanism, managed by the United States, includes the Lebanese Armed Forces, the IDF, UNIFIL (the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) and France. Jeffers brings extensive experience from deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan and has received numerous commendations for his service. Under the cease-fire terms, Hezbollah is prohibited from maintaining weapons south of the Litani River. However, Hezbollah operatives residing in villages in the area may return under the guise of civilians. Meanwhile, the IDF is required to withdraw to Israeli territory within 60 days, during which the Lebanese Army is expected to deploy in southern Lebanon and along the border to prevent weapons smuggling and Hezbollah’s rearmament. Israel has also agreed to enter negotiations over the land border with Lebanon. The international enforcement mechanism will monitor compliance, while Israel retains the right to act against violations. A side letter from Washington assured Israel of its ability to enforce the agreement unilaterally if necessary. According to the letter, Israel and the U.S. will share sensitive intelligence on violations, with the U.S. authorized to share some information with the Lebanese government or the enforcement mechanism. The letter explicitly grants Israel the right to respond to violations in southern Lebanon and address broader threats elsewhere if Lebanon cannot or will not act. Any such actions must be coordinated with the U.S. Israeli reconnaissance flights over Lebanon will continue for intelligence purposes but are restricted to avoid breaking the sound barrier. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk1fwztxkg	2024-11-30T13:39:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/30/Bkb5QbYmyx/Bkb5QbYmyx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
From deals with third-world countries to dubious middlemen: Insid...	With US supplies limited, embargoes imposed and competition from Ukraine, IDF turns to third-world deals, shady brokers and billions in spending to maintain its firepower as Israel races to replenish depleted weapons stockpiles after over a year of war In the dead of night on September 12, 1990, the wheels of an El Al Boeing 747 hit the airport runway in Israel with history in the hold: Two Apache attack helicopters, folded up and dismantled, ready for assembly. By the following morning, they were ready for their maiden flight. It's been 34 years. Apache helicopters have taken part in all wars and operations ever since but eventually became worn out. Although the Apaches were fixed up and upgraded over the years, the more advanced Saraf was introduced and the Apache’s days seemed numbered. When the Cobra squadron bases closed down, the IDF was left with only two active combat helicopter squadrons—the 190th and 113th Apache squadrons. Last year, the IAF was preparing to close them too. The army preferred long-range stealth bombers, like the F-13 that can get as far as Iran, and continue bolstering the attack UAV array. A 'flying tank' like the Apache sounds a bit outdated, more suitable for the wars of yesteryear. Then came October 7. That morning, there were four Apache helicopters on standby at the Ramat David Air Base. They took off to the Gaza border region at around 7:00 a.m. Half an hour later, more and more helicopters were sent off. The Apaches were called from one place to the next. 'Every five or six minutes, I was getting another call-out,' says 113th squadron commander, Lt. Col. A. They participated in the battles at kibbutzim, the defense of bases that had been attacked, and in efforts to repel the waves of looters and terrorists from Gaza. At some battle sites, their roles were decisive. These critical hours proved that there really is no substitute for these 'flying tanks' and the pilots who can see what’s happening to the infantry and armored corps on the ground, and communicate with them directly. Nukhba terrorists’ videos show they were afraid of almost nothing. The noise of the combat helicopters, however, permeated them with fear. Apaches have been in the skies almost continuously since then. The use of attack helicopters, including in the ground operation in Lebanon, has been so intensive that the IAF has taken the extraordinary measure of returning even retired Apaches for their sixth decade of active duty. Closing down squadrons? Outdated helicopters? If this war has proven anything, it’s that we need more Apache helicopters. But this is where the problems start. The Defense Ministry asked the Americans to urgently purchase more Apaches, even used ones. They just need to get here. The Americans agreed, but told Israel to wait in line at Boeing which manufactures them. It’ll be a few years. The IDF looked into whether, nonetheless, anything might be done to speed things up and free up a few Apache 'slots' (production line orders dedicated to specific countries). In other words, arrange it so that some other country waits a little and, in its place, considering its urgency, the IDF receives whatever that country ordered. It turned out that Boeing had 300 Apache helicopters in various stages of production earmarked for the U.S. Army. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Charles Brown, however, turned down the IDF’s request to transfer the helicopters. Poland, for example, that had put in its order before October 7, would be receiving 90 new Apaches. The IDF, on the other hand, wouldn’t be getting such helicopters anytime soon. This chase for Apaches is just one of many examples. A year and a month into this intensive war, Israel needs almost everything—shells, tanks, F-15 one-ton bombs. To this end, a transglobal race has kicked off in efforts to procure as many armaments as possible, as quickly as possible, for as little money as possible. It’s just that all of this is very complicated indeed. Some countries have imposed arms embargos on Israel, and some manufacturers are demanding exorbitant prices. And there’s always the stiff competition with other world conflicts, chiefly the war in Ukraine. Take, for example, the IDF’s desperate need for tanks and artillery shells: When the ground operation kicked off, the guys in the tanks and the Artillery Corps fired almost with abandon. If a target looked suspicious, they’d shoot. But very quickly, around December, the ground forces started keeping an eye on their arsenals, also reserved for a full ground operation in Lebanon. Israel then asked the U.S. for American shells. They agreed and the shipment showed up within weeks. At the same time, to build up an arsenal, the defense establishment also asked a Balkan state to immediately purchase thousands of shells. 'The price they quoted us was high. When we got back to them, hoping to negotiate a better price, they upped the price by 50% to the vicinity of $4,500 for an individual shell, and $6,000 for a cannon shell. These are very high prices' says a senior ranking defense establishment official familiar with these efforts. 'They also demanded a downpayment. We came back home to think about it and assess the option. We then got a call from them, telling us we’d missed our chance and that Ukraine had paid and bought the lot before us.' 'We go to countries you wouldn’t believe an Israeli has ever set foot in,' says a defense establishment official. 'Countries with whom we have no diplomatic relations, including Muslim states on all continents. You’d never believe who’s agreed to sell to us, but with one key condition.' So, from the start of last year through to right now, IDF officers and Defense Ministry officials have been galivanting around the world on procurement trips. According to various reports, some of these countries, such as Serbia, which has become Israel’s main arms supplier over the past year, have good relations with Russia, and would, it seems, rather supply to Israel than to Ukraine. Others, like India, which has relations with Iran and hundreds of millions of Muslims in its country, sell arms to Israel despite internal difficulties. According to foreign reports, India has become Israel’s main provider of explosive materials, selling thousands of tons to the IDF Engineering Corps. Oh, and these reports were published in Spain, which doesn’t shy away from harming Israel in any way it can. This is yet one more example illustrating how this race is driven by two things: Politics and money, and not necessarily in that order. 'We go to countries you wouldn’t believe an Israeli has ever set foot in,' says a defense establishment official. 'Countries with whom we have no diplomatic relations, including Muslim states on all continents. You’d never believe who’s agreed to sell to us, but with one key condition.' What condition is that? 'That we don’t reveal their identities.' Some countries not only insist on complete secrecy, or demand outrageous prices. They also take advantage of Israel’s predicament, demanding a return they were very unlikely to have gotten in the past, including the reciprocal sale of Israeli-manufactured advanced boutique technology. A third-world country, never mind from which continent, or whether it uses the Cyrillic or Arabic script, demanded, and received, military technology that may include advanced UAVs, computerized warfare systems, etc. in exchange for the most basic needs such as gunpowder, shells, explosive devices and other low-tech military equipment. According to the sources who spoke to Ynet's sister publication Yedioth Aharonoth, some of these deals weren’t entirely formal, almost under the table. With Defense Ministry approval, but at lightning speed. This is what it’s like in Israel’s new race for arms, which has itself become a battle. The arms justify the means, even via dubious sources, even with far-flung countries. We just need something to shoot. The problem: The prolongation of the war During the week following October 7, IDF officers opened up the emergency arsenal storerooms of two Northen and Southern Command reserves divisions (146th and 252nd respectively) and their faces dropped. Alongside the shortage of equipment, such as walkie-talkies, ceramic vests, weapons and hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles not fit for use, they realized that over 50% of commanders didn’t have the night-vision devices (NVDs), needed for the upcoming ground operation. These instruments are critical for any modern ground warfare, and Hamas and Hezbollah already had them. There are only a few companies in the world that know how to manufacture NVDs meeting military standards. 'Elbit is one such company, and we knew that it already had a deal finalized at the time to supply the American Army with 10,000 bino and monocular NVDs,' says an officer who was involved. 'So, we swiftly asked the American Army if they would turn this deal over to us. They explained, however, that only a presidential decree could release the equipment that was already in U.S. Army warehouses. We paid $127 million for these NVDs, got the presidential decree and flew them straight to officers in Gaza as, even on those first days, we knew we were going for a long war. That was one of many complex measures we’ve taken along the line to equip the army.' And the root cause of the problem is the long war: Over the years, the IDF had readied for short wars of a few weeks. 'Short wars were a national necessity,' a senior ranking officer tells us. 'The Israeli economy can’t take, and may consequently collapse from, a long war. The Israeli public, on whose civil-Zionist sentiment the IDF’s strength as a reservist army rests, will erode accordingly. The political echelon instructed the IDF to prepare for a short, deadly war with powerful opening strikes. Bang-and-we’re-done, if you like—like in the Second Lebanon War in 2006, and Operation Protective Edge in 2014.' With this as a working assumption, one might rely on importing weapons and armaments from other countries. 'With hindsight, for our military buildup, we had developed an existential defense dependence on the United States and countries such as Germany. This relies on an extremely dangerous amalgam of foreign products,' says a senior defense official. 'It has to change, even if the costs are high.' But the war dragged on and the arsenals were depleting. Left with no choice, the IDF was forced to economize its arms use. And this comes at a price. Forces operating now for weeks in Jabaliya are getting less UAV time. Tanks are going out on operations with limited shells. They also have fewer D9 bulldozers. Some of the equipment has been transferred to Lebanon, some has been hit or worn out in Gaza. There are also fewer using precision weapons, such as suicide drones or precision steel-penetrating laser-guided mortars. On the ground, there’s no real difference for now. 'Personally, I believe that statistically, artillery and direct tank fire are more effective than expensive precision weapons,' says an officer fighting in northern Gaza. 'Killing a terrorist using a tank shell or sniper, rather than a missile fired from a UAV, is regarded as more ‘professional’.' The various configurations of explosive materials are also being carefully managed by the IDF. 'Only last month, IDF forces used 100 tons of gunpowder to blow up a network of Hezbollah tunnels in the north. We’ve collapsed hundreds of miles of tunnels in Gaza and have still only reached half,' says a senior officer. 'Where do you think we have so much gunpowder from?' There’s only one answer to this question: From wherever possible, and as quickly as we can. The defense establishment has been forced into 'barter' deals with foreign armies, and speeding up weapons inspection that used to take months. In one case, a huge shipment of explosives arrived for the ground forces in the dead of night from a country whose military equipment isn’t known for its world standards. Instead of a lengthy, ordered, inspection, the material was transferred directly to Testing Ground 24, by the Rishon Lezion coastline. Technological and Logistics Directorate (ATAL) officers test-fired a few hundred of these weapons in the field, tested to see if they met regulations, took X-ray photographs of them, and immediately sent them to soldiers waiting for them avidly on the battlefield. 'Some people in the U.S. Army are in love with Israel, and support us in ways it’s hard to describe. Like homies.' In these ways, thousands of weapons from overseas have been assimilated into the IDF over the past year. 'Yes,' the IDF will admit, 'the haste meant that even when some weapons failed preliminary testing and weren’t sent to the soldiers, most of the weapons we bought, including advanced aerial weapons that we received from countries you wouldn’t believe would agree to sell to us—were in working order. To arm the IDF, we found ourselves in places you’d never imagine.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In these desperate times, the defense establishment turned to 'jobbers'—international arms dealers specializing in brokering indirect deals. 'With the international arms race, everyone’s doing it,' says the defense establishment. 'Not all jobbers are reliable, but sometimes, we have no choice.' A senior defense official familiar with the matter explains how it works: 'The Ukrainians don’t pay for many of their arms purchases. Someone else—various third parties—will buy for them, and this affects our arms race.' The official also recalls an unusual situation this past year illustrating the dangers of working with wheeler-dealer arms traders: The IDF requested to quickly purchase artillery fuzes for a critical weapon. This fuze didn’t exist in Israel’s weapons industry and defense establishment procurement officials checked with these 'jobbers.' One jobber told the Israelis that there was a manufacturing facility in a certain country (naming a third-world country) that has this fuze. The condition, however, was a 25-year Israeli investment in this facility.' So, what did you do? 'We quickly sent a representative of ours. After spending a whole day looking for this weapons factory—in a very exotic country—he met the local broker, and then went looking for the plant.' What did he find? 'Mostly ruins. When he got back to Israel, he told us that there were no fuzes there, no warehouses and no factory—but at least the food was great. It’s important to understand that we’re leaving no stone unturned to find weapons and weapons substitutes for the IDF, and we need to investigate any rumor in this crazy market. States buy from wherever they can. We had cases where we purchased weapons that we learned were faulty when they got to Israel, and we had to send them back.' The defense establishment stresses that most arms deals are between governments, but that the arms race and relentless pressure to arm the IDF, means there are individual cases purchasing arms from 'a selling, but state, source.' This essentially refers to an arms dealer on the government’s behalf. Third-world African countries, for example, with arms they had once bought sitting in warehouses, are now offering to sell them. Within weeks, these 'goods' will reach a Givati battalion in Jabaliya in Gaza or an Engineering Corps soldier in Maroun El Ras in Lebanon. 'Every ‘hand’ along the way, obviously makes the product more expensive. We had cases where they asked for a 150% downpayment as they’d heard on the news that the IDF now needed more weapons,' says a defense official. 'The market’s gone so crazy that arms dealers approached us at the start of the war telling us that they knew about warehouses of shell fuzes in Switzerland—despite there being no such thing in Switzerland. There are arms dealers, primarily Israelis, who won’t bluff us. They’re mainly ex-Israeli defense, and their reputation is important to them. Some dealers will sell their own grandmother for the chance of another deal selling 5 tons of TNT.' So, what do you do? 'In efforts to overcome this and speed up deals, we’ve learned how to work with several sources and dealers simultaneously.' Defense officials sent to these countries to procure weapons for the IDF say that some of these countries are not officially on our side. 'These might be Muslim countries that, on one hand, will firmly condemn Israel and provide safe haven to terrorist organizations,' says one official, 'and on the other, sell us weapons without batting an eyelid, so long as we maintain full discretion.' Why do we have to buy from these countries? 'The Americans have arms, good for decades, scattered across the globe. CENTCOM (United States Central Command) has a great deal of weapons, and they’ve been opening up these arsenals to give us military equipment over the past year. There were times they found they’d miscalculated and didn’t have enough for themselves, claiming ‘they too are at war.' Generally speaking, however, they go out of their way to help us with supplies. We don’t get everything from the U.S. though.' American homies And still, Israel’s main weapons provider is the United States. The diplomatic fall-out and lack of trust between the Israeli government and the Democratic U.S. administration hardly improves—to say the least—Israel’s armament in the throes of war. So, to secure Israeli armaments, senior officials are sometimes forced into using personal relationships they’ve developed with their U.S. Army colleagues. Some of this aid borders on begging. That American aircraft carrier remained in the Middle East in recent months, only thanks to a personal request by a senior IDF officer to CENTCOM officers and Gen. Michael Kurilla, widely viewed as very sympathetic to Israel’s needs. Senior ranking officers tell us of friendly WhatsApp conversations with their American counterparts culminating in whole containers of explosive materials earmarked for U.S. forces being shipped to the IDF from explosive materials superpower Taiwan, or from Guam in the Pacific Ocean that’s under U.S. military control. 'CENTCOM officers release armaments wherever they can,' says a senior ranking IDF official. 'They also help with the transportation by land or sea, and speed up maritime and aerial procedures to Israel. This is global in many senses. Some people in the U.S. Army are in love with Israel, and support us in ways it’s hard to describe. Like homies.' One of these homies is CENTCOM deputy commander, three-star general Brad Cooper. 'Almost each week, Cooper will receive a request for aid from the IDF. He’ll contact his friends in the U.S. Army and send messages to senior ranking U.S. officers across the globe to see who can, in a matter of days, transfer to the IDF certain weapons from arsenals scattered across the globe.' At the same time, however, IDF is also feeling the reverberations from the Washington-Jerusalem political fallout and President Joe Biden’s veto of some of the shipments. At the beginning of this year, a routine shipment of 3,000 JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition) bombs for the Air Force was supposed to arrive. This is a kit of sorts that transforms a 'dumb' bomb designated to be simply thrown into the air on a ballistic flightpath, into a 'smart' bomb, self-guiding itself to its predetermined target. Approximately half the shipment consisted of half-ton bombs, the rest weighing one ton. The payment to Boeing, the manufacturer, was made in shekels, rather than dollars from the aid monies. The IDF swiftly leased a ship to carry this shipment from a port near New York to Ashdod. At the last minute, however, the White House ordered halting the shipment. IDF top brass were left astounded, and only after weeks of persuasion, chiefly by former defense minister Yoav Gallant opposite his Pentagon counterpart, was the shipment approved—in part. Only the half-ton bombs were sent to Israel. The Americans officially claimed that the one-ton bombs might cause extraordinary peripheral damage, killing uninvolved civilians mainly in Gaza. These containers of bombs, for which the Israeli tax-payer had paid millions of shekels, are meanwhile at an East Coast port. The army is now looking for storage space for them to stop them from rusting. Another, no less critical, shipment stuck in the U.S. is that of 130 D9 diggers for the Engineering Corps, still awaiting transportation from the Caterpillar plant to Israel. This vast shipment is pending approval from State Department officials. Engineering Corps heavy-duty equipment personnel desperately need these vehicles that have proven decisive in this war. 'We have to change our way of thinking' The U.S. administration has more problems than its political fallout with Israel: It has committed to supplying Ukraine with arms too, and the needs of Ukraine’s army and those of the IDF invariably clash. Everyone needs artillery shells. Right now. This was Gallant’s first conversation with his American counterpart, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, in the first hours of October 7. Understanding that Israel was going to war, Gallant asked Austin for a few urgent things. One amazed the secretary of defense. 'Fifty thousand artillery shells?' he asked. 'Is that what you’re short of right now? You have far more than that. The shells are already in Germany on their way to Ukraine.' These were the 50,000 American artillery shells stored in emergency U.S. Army warehouses in Israel for any emergency that may arise. Like the war in Gaza. Truth be told, far more shells—around 250,000—were stored mainly in secret warehouses in southern Israel. Back in 2022, however, Israel received an urgent request to approve transferring these shells to Ukraine. Israel didn’t foresee a major military conflict at the time. The Russians were pounding the Ukrainians and Jerusalem agreed the shells would leave from here. Two hundred thousand shells had already reached Ukraine. Another 50,000 were already in Germany, also about to be shipped out to Ukraine. With American approval, Gallant managed to halt that shipment and bring it back to Israel. What will happen down the line with the shells? Defense Ministry envoys are running around the world to find more. In February, Elbit was asked to increase its local artillery shell production lines. Elbit is in the planning stages of setting up a plant in the Negev to add to its factories in the Sharon and northern Israel. And then? Artillery personnel will have to be careful about firing any 155 mm projectile. The U.S. is, obviously, not the world’s only arms producer, but buying from other countries is an extremely politically charged affair. We have the Western countries who’ve declared arms embargos on Israel. In some cases, it’s for show: Canada declared an embargo, while in practice only ever supplied a tiny quantity of arms to Israel. The French embargo, on the other hand, does damage Israeli armament efforts. 'We never depended on the French anyway,' says a defense establishment official. 'Their leadership harbors a burning hatred toward Israel.' Italy, which Israel believed would support Israel following the election of right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, halted its supply of cannon shells for Israeli Navy vessels and spare parts for them at the start of the war. Israel purchased these weapons—no surprise—from the U.S. The Defense Ministry is making efforts to increase Israeli production as an alternative to this dependency. Germany, as mentioned, is one major arms supplier to the IDF that continues to support Israel, as do Hungary and the Czech Republic. Despite Britain officially publishing a black list of weapons export licenses to Israel that have been frozen, in practice, some weapons are still being sold and are reaching Israel. This mainly includes components for avionics systems and parts for weapons production lines for Israeli ground forces. And what about all the rest? Like we said, Israel will have to get them on its own. Here’s another story illustrating the problems of Israeli arms producers’ dependency on foreign sources, in a country such as Israel. At the beginning of this year, an Israeli arms manufacturer noticed signs suggesting that a company supplying it with explosive raw materials was caving into pressure and was about to cut off supply. 'We’re talking about tens of tons of various kinds of explosive raw materials, without which we can’t produce thousands of missiles, bombs, interceptors and a wide range of other weapons for the IDF. And this was in the middle of a year of war,' says an official familiar with the incident. So, what did you do? 'Even before this boycott was official, we managed to quickly turn to another supplier and seal a new deal so as not to find ourselves stuck with an acute shortage of weapons for the soldiers. These are things that have to be spotted early on. You need to act quickly. If you don’t, you’re in a huge mess.' Army and arms manufacturers sources say that one lesson learned from this new arms race is that Israel will need to set up a huge national stockpile of explosives for manufacturing various IDF weapons to last years ahead. The IDF’s 23 attachés across the globe have also been recruited to the procurement campaign. By the first month of the war, the Defense Ministry headquarters gave them a list, instructing them to turn to their respective local defense ministries and activate the connections they’d cultivated. It was now money time. 'This is how I found myself dropping ‘multi-national’ bombs,' says a senior pilot. The fuze is from Asia, the GPS kit from some a German warehouse, and the weapon’s central component is from an American warehouse in Japan.' The Planning Directorate’s foreign relations department made efforts to free up supply lines that had never been open to Israel, including countries officially condemning Israel. 'There’s a country that agreed to sell us certain weaponry, only on certain transportation conditions,' says an IDF officer. So, what did you do? 'We were forced to transport the shipment with connections between cargo planes and trucks and ships jaunting from one place to the next. Some of the equipment arrived after ‘14 working days,' but some of it sailed between far-off continents for months before reaching the guy in the tank in Jabaliya.' The two men running this complex round-the-world effort are Deputy Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Amir Baram and head of the Planning and Force Build-up Directorate Maj. Gen. Eyal Harel. They have a clear division of responsibilities: Baram deals with the army internally—who needs what and when; Harel tries to get hold of it from foreign armies and governments. Defense Ministry procurement personnel are also trying to untangle bureaucratic obstacles and pacify treasury personnel. The game is mainly about speed. With all the conflicts across the globe, lots of people will be jumping at the chance to buy a single ton of explosive materials. 'We need to wake up. We’re not alone in the world,' says a senior IDF official. 'Arms manufacturers’ production lines open up and are snatched up in the blink of an eye. You must understand: even if Resolution 1701 is implemented tomorrow, Hezbollah retreats north of the Litani, there’s a full hostage deal in Gaza and cease-fire prevails over the Middle East, we’ll still only be at the start of the IDF’s military buildup for years, decades to come. It’s also clear that it won’t be the same IDF as we had before October 7.' The IDF is wary of the delay in the procurement of new 'Reshef' Sa’ar ships manufactured for the Navy by Israel Shipyards Ltd., replacing the outdated Nirit 4.5. The acquisition deal for JLVT (known in the IDF as 'Para') tank parts, designed mainly to replace the old M113 APC, is moving forward. The concern, however, as mentioned, is for urgent armament. This includes purchasing hundreds of Tamir interceptors for Iron Dome, Arrow and David’s Sling batteries. 'The Iranians aren’t stupid,' says an IDF official about the need for interceptors. 'Between rounds, they are tweaking their methods and trying to manipulate our aerial defense systems—be against fire from Iran, Lebanon, Yemen or Iraq.' So, what do you do? 'We have to ease up regulations, change our way of thinking. We have years of fighting ahead, and on more than one front.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1tefly71g	2024-11-30T13:07:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/03/05/BJggZzgB6T/BJggZzgB6T_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Assad pledges to defeat rebels in northern Syria	Syrian President Bashar al-Assad vowed on Saturday to crush the rebel offensive in the country's north as forces opposing his regime made significant gains in the provinces of Idlib, Aleppo and Hama. 'We can defeat the terrorists,' he said in a phone call with UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, where the two leaders discussed 'the latest developments in Syria and regional matters.'

IDF identifies soldier killed in northern Gaza combat	Staff Sgt. Zamir Burke, 20, combat engineer squad commander in 401st Brigade's 601st Engineering Battalion, from Beit Shemesh, fell in Jabaliya; IDF aircraft destroy central Gaza rocket launch site poised to fire at Israeli territory The IDF reported on Saturday that Staff Sgt. Zamir Burke, 20, a combat engineer squad commander in the 401st Armored Brigade's 601st Engineering Battalion, from Beit Shemesh, was killed in combat in the northern Gaza Strip town of Jabaliya. Another soldier from the battalion was seriously wounded by an anti-tank missile during the incident. Separately, a 46th Armored Battalion soldier from the same brigade was severely wounded in southern Gaza, and a soldier from the 7th Armored Brigade's 82nd Battalion was severely wounded during an operational accident in northern Israel, which the IDF is investigating. Meanwhile, the IDF reported that an Israeli aircraft destroyed a rocket launch site in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, which it said was poised to fire at Israeli territory. According to the IDF, rockets were launched from the site following the strike but did not cross into Israeli territory. Earlier in the day, a rocket alert was sounded in Netiv HaAsara near Gaza, but the IDF later confirmed it was a false alarm. Separately, the World Central Kitchen (WCK) organization announced the suspension of its operations in Gaza after several staff members were killed in an Israeli strike on a vehicle. The IDF confirmed that one of the fatalities, Hazmi Kadih, was involved in the October 7 massacre at Kibbutz Nir Oz. Kadih had been employed by WCK. In response, Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) has demanded clarifications from international officials and WCK leadership regarding the employment of personnel linked to terrorist activities. 'IDF and Shin Bet will continue to operate to locate and eliminate terrorists who conduct terrorist activities against the civilians of Israel and those involved in the murderous October 7 massacre,' the military said.

Syrian rebels capture Aleppo International Airport amid rapid gai...	Russian and Syrian forces continue to launch airstrikes to repel rebel advances, as death toll rises to 327; Syrian regime says preparing counteroffensive while army forces reportedly withdraw from Hama Rebel forces in Syria claimed to have captured Aleppo International Airport on Saturday afternoon, marking another major gain for opponents to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the country's second-largest city. Earlier, the Syrian regime had suspended all flights and closed the airport. The rebels, reporting dramatic progress, said they now control more than half of Aleppo. The Syrian and Russian air forces responded with heavy airstrikes targeting rebel positions in Aleppo, including those of the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based opposition war monitor. The Observatory reported that the death toll in the clashes has risen to 327, including Ahmed Khader Ali, a senior security official for the Assad regime in Aleppo. The rebels also announced a new front in the Hama region, claiming to have captured six villages. Rebel forces have also been moving southward in the Idlib region, reportedly seizing the city of Maarat al-Numan and now control the entire Idlib Governorate, according to rebel sources cited by Reuters. The Syrian Defense Ministry acknowledged that rebels had entered significant portions of Aleppo but pledged a concentrated counteroffensive. 'Syrian forces will take all measures to ensure the safety of Aleppo residents and restore control,' the Assad regime said in a statement. Meanwhile, Syrian forces are retreating from the city of Hama in the northwest toward Homs, according to reports in Syria. The offensive, led by HTS and supported by other rebel groups, is the largest assault against the Syrian army since a 2020 cease-fire in northern Syria. HTS, formerly Al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, holds territory in Idlib and parts of neighboring Hama, Aleppo and Latakia governorates. The rapid gains by the rebels have prompted strong accusations from Iran, a key ally of President Assad. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, in a call with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, claimed the offensive was part of an 'American-Zionist plan to destabilize the region.' The rebel advance comes as Assad's forces, backed by Russian air power and Iranian support, continue to face challenges in maintaining control over northern Syria, where much of the decade-long civil war has been centered. According to Ynet senior military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai, the surprise attack by Sunni rebels in Aleppo is likely strongly tied to the cease-fire between Israel and the Shiite Hezbollah terror group. Following the cease-fire declaration in Lebanon, it seems that Syrian rebels, in consultation with Turkey, concluded that this was the right moment to strike—while Hezbollah, Iran's other proxies and Revolutionary Guard forces in Syria are at their weakest and focused on aiding Lebanon. As such, this was seen as an opportune time to hit the Assad regime. The 2011 uprising against Syrian President Assad was met with brutal suppression, plunging the country into a civil war that continues more than a decade later. Assad managed to cling to power with critical support from Russia and Iran, and his forces’ recapture of Aleppo in 2016 marked a decisive moment in solidifying his regime. The rebels’ offensive, coinciding with the cease-fire in Lebanon, comes amid shifting power dynamics in Syria, fueled by escalating clashes between Israel and Iran’s proxies, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Amid the regional turmoil, Israel has ramped up its airstrikes targeting Iranian forces in Syria. According to UN figures, Israel has conducted more than 116 strikes in the country, resulting in over 100 fatalities. Meanwhile, hostilities have driven around half a million people to cross from Lebanon into Syria. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sylt6poqke	2024-11-30T09:03:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/30/SyYDTwuXkl/SyYDTwuXkl_0_177_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Why Mikati failed to save Lebanon from Hezbollah, despite hopes	Long allied with the terror group and Syria the western educated billionaire promised to bring Lebanon out of economic crisis but remains too weak to bring any change on the ground Lebanon's care-taker prime minister Najib Mukati was chosen to head the government in Beirut in 2021, until a new cabinet could be agreed on. As Lebanon's wealthiest man, many hoped he would be able to save the failing state from economic collapse. 'Mikati attempted to build his name as a central figure who could bring Lebanon out of its financial crisis,' says Dr. Ido Zelkovitz, head of the Middle East Studies Program at the Jezreel Valley Academic College. 'He had the background in business and education.' He was a graduate of the American University in Beirut, went on to study business at INSEAD in France and later on at Harvard. But his alliance with the Syrian regime and with Hezbollah has been long-lasting. He first came to power as an interim leader in 2005 after the assassination of then prime minister Rafik Hariri. Lebanese public outrage at the murder that was carried out by Hezbollah at the direction of Damascus, brought down the government and Mikati who was a member of parliament, was called to step in until elections were held. In 2011 after the government of Saad Hariri, the slain prime minister's son, also fell, he once again was called to lead but was forced out two years later as opposition to the Syrian involvement in Lebanon, once again reached a boiling point. In 2021, Mikati was supported by most political parties in Parliament, including Hezbollah, to take the reigns of government once again. He said he aimed to form a cabinet of professionals without political affiliation, to bring the necessary economic reforms to the struggling nation, already in dire economic difficulties. To the Lebanese public, however, he was a member of the corrupt elite that caused the crisis. The local currency crashed, inflation peaked, food prices spiked and according to the UN, the poverty rate stood at 78%. Power outages were a daily occurrence and fuel was in short supply. Mikati called on the Arab world to assist. 'As long as he is indebted to Hezbollah, he is part of the obstacles on the path of economic recovery,' Zelkovitz says. Hezbollah is the reason that the West and Sunni Arab nations refrain from investing in Lebanon. Mikat, therefore could not forge the ties that would bring such investments. 'He is a band aid on the problem, at best,' Says Eitan Ishai from the department of Islamic and Middle Eastern studies at the Hebrew University. 'Although he is bias to one side, his lack of charisma allows him to be prime minister. He comes from a well-known Sunni family, has experience in politics and is convenient for Hezbollah. Lebanon has been in economic, political and social crisis since 2019 and this war came out of nowhere. Mikati will bring no great change.' During the months of war, the care-taker prime minister was a vocal critic of Israel. He engaged Arab and international leaders to advance a cease-fire but had no real influence and it was speaker of parliament Nabih Berri, who represented Hezbollah in those efforts. After the cease-fire agreement came into effect Mikati called on residents of South Lebanon not to return to their villages until the Lebanese army tells them to. His calls were ignored, and convoys of displaced villagers were seen heading south waving Hezbollah flags. Despite the years-long alliance with Hezbollah, on one thing Mikati and the terror-group do not agree and that is Iran's involvement in Lebanon. In October, Iran's speaker of parliament Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaftold the French Le Figaro, that his country was willing to negotiate over the implementation of UN resolution 1701, passed at the end of the 2006 Second Lebanon War. Mikat was outraged and summoned the Iranian Charge D'affaires for a meeting to clarify the comments. 'This is an outrageous intervention in Lebanese internal affairs and an attempt to assert unacceptable control,' he said. But according to Zelkovitz, Mikati understands that Hezbollah does have the support of some Lebanese and he would not try to diminish its political standing after the military beating it sustained in the war. 'He wants to keep the Shi'ite Sunni consensus,' he says. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: If he could disarm Hezbollah, I believe he would do so happily. He is first of all a patriot who want to bridge the gap between sectors,' Zelkowitz says. 'I don't think the Lebanese army could disarm Hezbollah and there is a strong affiliation between the military and the Iran-backed group. American military equipment and technology, especially invested in internal security in the Lebanese army could find its way into Hezbollah's hands.' Lebanon has been without a president for the past two years after Michel Aoun stepped down in October 2022. The political agreement between the religious groups in Lebanon states that the president would come from the Christian community and the prim minister from the Sunni Muslim sector. This has led to a political stalemate with no sector able to force its position on others in a way that would alter the reality on the ground. Since Aoun's departure, Mikati and Berri have been trying to lead in the vacuum left behind. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjrve5omkx	2024-11-30T04:42:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/15/H1eU11qRjykx/H1eU11qRjykx_1_314_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Biden buys book on Israel-Palestine conflict by critical historia...	The Hundred Years' War on Palestine by historian Rashid Khalidi describes the conflict as a colonial war against the indigenous people of Palestine; author most prominent anti-Israel voice especially after Hamas massacre U.S. President Joe Biden was spotted leaving a book store on Friday, after he purchased The Hundred Years' War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917–2017, a book by Palestinian historian Rashid Khalidi. Biden played out a traditional practice of shopping on Black Friday, launching the American custom of shopping for the holiday season. Khalidi has been vocal in in criticism of Israel especially after the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre and said earlier in the year, before Biden pulled out of the presidential race, that he would not vote to reelect the president. He is considered one of the more prominent voices critical of Israel. In a recent interview he said the political motivations of Israel are unclear. They conduct ethnic cleansing, push the population of northern Gaza to the south but what their ultimate aim is remains unclear. Khalidi's book that was published in 2020 offers and critical and a considered controversial analysis of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict where he accuses Israel of conducting a 'colonialist war against the native Palestinians.' According to Khalidi's book, modern Palestinian history can best be understood as a colonialist war to force them out of their homeland. Khalidi, a short summery of the book says, the war was first forged by the Zionist movement and later by the state of Israel but with the backing of the United States and Great Britain, the superpowers of the time. Khalidi was also critical of president elect Donald Trump who in his first term in office, moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and recognized Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, calling his policies discriminatory of the Palestinians. He said the conflicts between settlers and indigenous people always end in one of three ways: By complete defeat of the indigenous population, as was the case in north America, by the colonialists being pushed out, as was in Algeria or by reconciliation and compromise, as was the case in South Africa after the fall of the apartheid regime, in Zimbabwe and Ireland. He wrote that the popular resistance – as he calls the Palestinian conflict – will continue and praised the first intifada as an extraordinary example of an uprising against oppression that can be considered the first victory of the Palestinians in the colonialist war that began in 1917. The second intifada, that resulted in the construction of the partition wall between the West Bank and Israel, Khalidi the greatest failure of the Palestinian national movement.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryshi8d7jg	2024-11-30T00:16:58-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/30/BJh3zSOXke/BJh3zSOXke_0_177_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

As Syrian rebels sweep into Aleppo, army closes airport and roads...	Russia promises Assad regime extra military aid to thwart the rebels; sources say new hardware would start arriving in the next 72 hours Syrian authorities closed Aleppo airport as well as all roads leading into the city on Saturday, three military sources told Reuters, as rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad said they had reached the heart of Aleppo. The opposition fighters, led by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, carried out a surprise sweep through government-held towns this week and reached Aleppo nearly a decade after having been forced out by Assad and his allies. Russia, one of Assad's key allies, has promised Damascus extra military aid to thwart the rebels, two military sources said, adding new hardware would start arriving in the next 72 hours. The Syrian army has been told to follow 'safe withdrawal' orders from the main areas of the city that the rebels have entered, three army sources said. The rebels began their incursion on Wednesday and by late Friday an operations room representing the offensive said they were sweeping through various neighbourhoods of Aleppo. They are returning to the city for the first time since 2016, when Assad and his allies Russia, Iran, and regional Shi'ite militias retook it, with the insurgents agreeing to withdraw after months of bombardment and siege. Mustafa Abdul Jaber, a commander in the Jaish al-Izza rebel brigade, said their speedy advance this week had been helped by a lack of Iran-backed manpower in the broader Aleppo province. Iran's allies in the region have suffered a series of blows at the hands of Israel as the Gaza war has expanded through the Middle East. The opposition fighters have said the campaign was in response to stepped-up strikes in recent weeks against civilians by the Russian and Syrian air force on areas in rebel-held Idlib, and to preempt any attacks by the Syrian army. Opposition sources in touch with Turkish intelligence said Turkey, which supports the rebels, had given a green light to the offensive. But Turkish foreign ministry spokesperson Oncu Keceli said on Friday that Turkey sought to avoid greater instability in the region and had warned recent attacks undermined de-escalation agreements. The attack is the biggest since March 2020, when Russia and Turkey agreed to a deal to de-escalate the conflict. Civilians killed in fighting On Friday, Syrian state television denied rebels had reached the city and said Russia was providing Syria's military with air support. The Syrian military said it was fighting back against the attack and had inflicted heavy losses on the insurgents in the countryside of Aleppo and Idlib. David Carden, U.N. Deputy Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Syria Crisis, said: 'We're deeply alarmed by the situation unfolding in northwest Syria.' 'Relentless attacks over the past three days have claimed the lives of at least 27 civilians, including children as young as 8 years old.'

Can Jews sill safely walk the streets?	ILTV's Insider explores how a Jewish safety crisis escalated and what can be done about it A young rabbi was murdered by terrorists in the United Arab Emirates. Canada's former justice minister was targeted in an Iranian assassination plot. Violent protests, filled with chants of 'death to the Jews' and calls to burn Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, erupted in Montreal. A recent survey by the Jewish Federations of North America revealed alarming statistics: nearly 25% of Jews experienced antisemitic incidents in the past year, and 75% overheard or saw antisemitic comments in person or online. Less than 100 years after six million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust, it is beginning to feel unsafe to walk the streets—anywhere in the world—even in Jewish communities, even in the Jewish state. Is there a Jewish safety crisis? How did it escalate, and what can be done to stop it? These were the questions explored on ILTV’s Insider last week. 'We have seen a significant rise in Jew-hating attacks, especially—but not only—since the October 7 attack last year,' said Dov Ben-Shimon, chief executive officer of the Community Security Service in America. 'But our adversaries don’t define us. Jewish life in the U.S. is still vibrant, compelling, and dynamic. At the same time, there is this wave of hate—this hatred of Jews that comes from the right and the left, from Islamic extremists and more—that threatens our people and our community. We have to be prepared now more than ever to stand up to that hate and evil.' Ben-Shimon explained that antisemitism has escalated in North America for several reasons: 'hate-reinforcing algorithms' on social media, an increasing number of individuals who hate Jews as Jews and Zionists and are not deterred from acting, and inadequate security measures to protect Jewish communities. On November 21, Rabbi Zvi Kogan, a Chabad emissary in the United Arab Emirates, was kidnapped and violently murdered. Ben-Shimon warned that such an event 'could absolutely happen' in the United States as well. He emphasized that one of the best ways to prevent such tragedies is by building local security networks in every Jewish community, regardless of size. 'It means training volunteers to act as force multipliers—the first line of defense in every community—to identify problems and connect with law enforcement and security teams,' Ben-Shimon said. 'It also means stronger communication, risk assessments, and training programs, especially on situational awareness, emergency procedures, and threat identification.' However, as Ben-Shimon and another guest, documentary filmmaker Pierre Rehov, pointed out, antisemitism is not a new phenomenon. In his latest work, 'Pogroms,' Rehov delves into the historical context of the October 7 attack and its roots. He attributes it to an alliance between Islamists, the KGB, and the Nazis, all driven by a shared goal to eradicate Jews and Israel. Despite these escalating threats, there remains no unified Western response, argued Vivian Bercovici, former Canadian ambassador to Israel and founder of the State of Tel Aviv website. 'I think that we see a lot of ostriching—burying heads in the sand and pretending it’ll pass, it’ll go away,' Bercovici told ILTV. Building on Rehov’s analysis, Bercovici highlighted a significant factor driving the rise of antisemitism in the West: the rapid growth of Muslim populations in Western countries over recent decades. 'People have not integrated into their communities, and they bring values that are very clearly hostile to Jewish people, and that’s what we’re seeing,' she said. Bercovici stressed the importance of recognizing reality rather than dismissing it. 'Look at the facts. Stop trying to explain them away,' she said. 'Stop behaving the way Jewish communities did in Europe in the 1930s.'

Remembering Yona Brief, an American-Israeli soldier who died in b...	Dovi Gordon: 'He was full of adventure and passion for life' Fallen soldier Yona Brief was laid to rest on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem earlier this week. Brief, an Israeli-American, was honored by thousands of mourners, many from Israel’s Anglo community. Brief had been injured in May 2023, and after being discharged, he insisted on rejoining the battle efforts. On October 7, he fought valiantly in Kfar Aza and had been hospitalized in the ICU since then. On Day 417 of the war, he succumbed to his wounds. His funeral became a national event, drawing thousands, including Knesset Member Chili Troper, who shared a few words in his memory. Tears were shed and stories were shared, as Yona Brief had become a symbol of bravery and sacrifice for many Israelis. 'I was lucky to know Yonah as a kid,' said close friend Dovi Gordon. 'We went to camp together, and he was full of adventure and passion for life.' Gordon recounted Yona’s heroic actions on October 7, when he and his comrades rushed to Kfar Aza. 'There’s a lot of things that happened that day, but the main thing, and the main act, was his commander got caught in an ambush, and Yonah went in to save them. Yonah told me—this is his words—that he felt the first few bullets going through. He said, it’s not too bad. I could continue,' Gordon continued. Despite his injuries, Yona pressed on, determined to save lives, even as he endured more wounds. 'He understood the whole time what was happening. The people I’ve spoken to said he knew he was sacrificing his life, and he decided to continue anyway,' Gordon recalled. 'And he was—he was the best. He was cool. He was fun to be around. He was always in a group of friends. He was always connecting between people in life,' his friend said. 'He just had that passion, and I think that’s what I take from him.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkvkbf00xjx	2024-11-29T19:20:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/30/SJXmfGdXJl/SJXmfGdXJl_0_90_407_230_0_small.jpg
The Rescue - The only firsthand account of October 7 by Israel's ...	When she needed a helicopter to evacuate the wounded from Gaza and no one responded, he texted, 'We’ll make sure it gets there'; Amid chaos at Kfar Aza, she set up the Paratroopers' HQ in Sderot - Major Noga and Guy, a 669 medic, reflect on pressure, partnership, and moments of comfort during the war October 8, 12:25 PM, a text message between Noga, the Head of Operational Command for the Paratrooper's Special Forces brigade, and Guy, a reserve combat paramedic in Unit 669: Noga: 'I need a rescue helicopter. We've got casualties. Can you help me?' Guy: 'What's the situation? Give me details.' Noga: 'We have three wounded.' Guy: 'Location?' This brief, technical exchange is emblematic of the chaos of October 7 and the days that followed. Even the sharpest observer wouldn't guess that this conversation was between an engaged couple who had already set a date and venue for their wedding. This happened just over a day after the horrific attack began. Terrorists were still roaming in Israel, and the fighting continued. 'Our unit's deputy commander was seriously wounded,' Noga recalls. 'They thought he was dead; someone even said so. I couldn't get through to the command center to request a rescue helicopter—no one was responding. It was a state of helplessness. So, I sent a WhatsApp to Guy, who was also in combat. It wasn't a conversation between partners.' Guy: 'I contacted a friend from 669 who serves at the Air Force's control center.' Noga: 'That's how I got a helicopter. It's one of the reasons why the unit's deputy commander is alive today. After a challenging six-month rehabilitation, he returned to his position and is back on the ground again in Gaza.' The next interactions between Noga and Guy were more intimate, but the circumstances were no less surreal. 'I was managing the combat headquarters of the unit, and we had set up a temporary command station in Sderot, which was still being heavily bombarded. I asked Guy to update me on his location,' says Noga, 27, who is about to complete her legal internship at the Supreme Court. 'On October 9, Guy sent me a message: 'We're in Kissufim.' Shortly after, I received a report of a shooting in Kissufim. Terrorists were opening fire and ambushing soldiers. I knew he was there. I tried calling Guy, but he didn't answer. I kept calling, but there was no response. I felt like I couldn’t breathe. For forty minutes, I was certain the worst had happened. Yet, I had to keep operating, overseeing my unit’s combat efforts and giving the impression that everything was under control, even though it was far from reality.' Guy, 30, a medical student at Tel Aviv University, tells what was happening from his perspective: 'As we were searching for Hamas gunmen who managed to ambush Golani Battalion soldiers and then managed to escape, we were ambushed. I was behind, not on the front line. We had seven guys wounded, two of them critically. We loaded them onto our Hummers and drove as fast as we could to a nearby open field and called in for a 669 rescue helicopter. While treating two casualties simultaneously—one with a gunshot wound to the head and the other with a round in the chest—I felt my phone vibrating in my pocket. In the midst of chaos, no call is more important than the wounded person bleeding and not breathing in front of you. We had arrived at the field location we coordinated with central command and were waiting for a helicopter, but the phone kept vibrating. I thought someone from 669 on the helicopter might be calling to locate us. I checked my phone and saw numerous missed calls from Noga. I called her back immediately, fearing something might have happened to her. She choked up on the phone, saying, 'I thought something happened to you. 'Noga: 'That was the first time I cracked. I cried with relief.' Noga and Guy married amid the war and during the emergency call-up, which has continued until today. They met maybe three or four times from October 7 until the big day. One of the meetings was when Noga asked Guy to bring her a package she ordered online for the wedding. 'It was a white dress for the dancing part, and I needed to see if it fit. I asked Guy to bring the package to the Gaza border.' Guy: 'I drove south and met Noga at an abandoned house near the border, where her team had been sleeping on the floor for months. The truth is I didn't know what was in the package. Noga opens the box, puts on the dress, and stands in front of the mirror. I see a smile spread across her face. And it's no longer the tired officer who just finished an exhausting shift. At that moment, she was Cinderella.' Noga: 'Guy hugged me. It was a magical moment.' Apart from the wedding and its preparations, Guy and Noga didn't experience many magical moments during the war. Guy recounts the events of October 7 and the war from his perspective as a combat paramedic in 669 and from the viewpoint of his teammates in his new book The Rescue- October 7 through the eyes of Israel’s Para Rescue Commandos, His first book, From Zero to One Hundred, published a few years ago, is a gripping diary of his special forces rescue team’s experiences during mandatory service. It has become essential reading for teenagers aspiring to join elite units and is popular with the general public. October 7 is a date etched into the memory of every Israeli. For Guy and his family, however, another date—September 30—was equally significant, just a week before the Hamas attack. 'I was on a trip to Georgia during the holiday of Sukkot with my parents and all my siblings,' says Guy. 'On Saturday evening, we were dining in a local restaurant in a remote village in the Caucasus Mountains. My dad seemed pale, sweating, and unwell. I thought it might be food poisoning from some khachapuri. Suddenly, his head slumped onto the plate, and his glasses broke.' 'My brother Ari, a commander and medic in the army, immediately sprang into action. He laid our father on the floor and elevated his legs. I knelt beside him, instinctively placing my hand on his neck and finding no pulse. It took about ten seconds for the gravity of the situation to hit me. I began performing CPR, questioning whether my compressions were deep enough and if the rhythm was correct. At the same time, I found myself saying goodbye to Dad, imagining how he wouldn't be there at my wedding and how much he loved Noga. Those two minutes felt like an eternity. Then, finally, he started showing signs of breathing. Meanwhile, a local ambulance arrived at the restaurant. 'More accurately, an old pickup truck with two Georgian grandmothers and no equipment at all. We're driving to the hospital - and there's not much equipment there either. One defibrillator in the whole complex. I struggle with the team to get him into catheterization, and then he goes into cardiac arrest again. It took two and a half days to bring him back to Israel on a medical flight accompanied by a friend who is an intensive care doctor. At Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem, doctors discovered an electrical issue with his heart. They implanted a pacemaker, and now he’s doing fine. Thank God. In 669 you've done quite a few resuscitations, both before October 7 and during the war. What's the difference between treating your father and treating a soldier or civilian you don't know? 'I believe the deepest fear for any medical professional is having to use their skills on someone they love. The fear was even greater in our case because we were alone. Suddenly, my father's life was in my hands'. 'Was this the most challenging experience of the past year for you?' 'Absolutely.' And he went through quite a few difficult things, especially on October 7. The week before October 7, Guy and Noga stayed at her parents' house in Moshav Shoresh, near the hospital where his father was being treated. On the morning of October 7, Noga left early to rush to her unit's base, while Guy delayed for about an hour. 'I didn't want to go to reserve duty; I wanted to be with my father. At that point, we still didn't know what was happening to him. I was debating whether to tell the unit I wouldn’t come and suggest they call someone else. After all, 669 isn’t dependent on just one person. But deep down, we don’t know how to say no. At 8:30, I got into the car, grabbed a coffee, and put on some music. I arrived at the 669 base, equipped myself, and met two in service rescue soldiers. We took a pickup truck and headed south. Looking back, we now view October 7 as a reality we've been living with for almost a year. But on that morning, it was as unimaginable as if aliens were about to invade Earth.' Guy and the two soldiers with him, all trained medics, were instructed to head to Kibbutz Nahal Oz. 'Three of us in a pickup truck—I was in the back—had no idea where we were going. We heard on the radio: 'Security incident in the south, special forces en route.' Suddenly, we were caught in a traffic jam and saw that the entire road and surrounding fields were filled with burned or bullet-riddled cars, bodies, and wounded people. There were screams and calls for help. Operating on autopilot, we grabbed the medical equipment and began treating the injured. We had no idea who these people were, what had happened, or if there were terrorists among them. One thing I did notice was that everyone was dressed in bright, colorful clothing as if they had just returned from India.' Today, anyone reading this description would immediately recognize it as the scene of the Nova party massacre. However, at that time, Guy and his comrades had no idea they were amidst the greatest disaster since the Holocaust. They were unaware that thousands of terrorists had effectively overrun the Gaza envelope, committing slaughter, arson, and abduction of men, women, and children. All they knew was that they had to reach Nahal Oz as quickly as possible. 669) is not just a rescue and medical evacuation unit, but also one of the four leading elite units in the IDF, whose members are trained for all combat scenarios.) We entered the kibbutz and began going house to house, fighting and rescuing the wounded. At one point, we received a call from our unit directing us to continue to Kfar Aza. When we arrived at the gate, we were met with complete chaos. Vehicles emerged from inside, carrying wounded soldiers and civilians in terrible condition. I realized that our most critical role was at the entrance of the community: treating the wounded, managing evacuation vehicles to get them out quickly, and keeping the route open for more teams of soldiers to enter and evacuate the injured. Meanwhile, medical supplies were running low. 'A soldier arrived with a gunshot wound to his stomach and his forearm blown off by a grenade. He was bleeding in front of me, and I didn’t even have a tourniquet. A paramedic from one of the units fighting inside Kfar Aza came to us, unloaded the wounded, and shouted, 'I need tourniquets.' I had none to give him. Were there any wounded you had to triage because there was no point in using time and equipment on them? 'Yes. There were wounded who still had a pulse and were breathing, but I knew I had no chance of saving them. Without a vehicle or sufficient equipment, I had to triage them and focus on providing improvised care to those I could still save.' On the night between Saturday and Sunday, Guy and his friends were sent to Kibbutz Be'eri. 'Until that moment I didn't know what was happening in Be'eri. I barely knew such a place existed. We received instructions to enter and search for survivors. We're driving slowly inside Be'eri, searching for hours. We found wounded and living people. There were still exchanges of fire with terrorists. But only when dawn broke did we really understand what happened there.' While Guy and his two unit comrades tried to cope with the chaos at the entrance to Kfar Aza, not far from there, in the town of Sderot, Noga was giving orders. 'Noga is the first woman in this role,' Guy says proudly. During the war, she also entered Gaza from time to time. 'I would update Guy only after I came out,' she says. A few months ago Noga was promoted. Now she commands the operations of the paratroopers brigade. Noga knows Major Uri Knafo, a company commander from their regular mandatory service in the Paratroopers. As fate would have it, Guy was in the helicopter team that rescued him when he was wounded in the fighting in Gaza. They recounted this story, which is beyond any imagination, when we sat at the 669 dorms on the unit's base. Not far from there, a memorial corner is being set up in memory of the seven669 fighters, officers and doctors of the unit who fell in the war. Since the beginning of the war, the unit has rescued and evacuated more than 2,000 wounded, one of whom was Knafo. Guy: 'It was Friday when we received an alert. We were airborne with four helicopters and landed in Khan Yunis in the Strip. The 669-ground team loaded six wounded. I took the two closest to the cockpit: one with shrapnel wounds and the other with a severe bullet injury to the leg.' 'The guy with the bullet in the leg was me,' says Knafo, 31, a high-tech professional from Tel Aviv. Guy: 'I could see you were in excruciating pain. I asked one of the medics to prepare a blood transfusion for you while I administered morphine. Then you suddenly said, 'I'm still on antibiotics.' I thought you might be hallucinating. We landed at Sheba Hospital in central Israel, and you grabbed my hand tightly and wouldn’t let go. As we entered the ambulance and arrived at the trauma room, you were comfortable thanks to the morphine. The doctor leaned over you and said, 'He looks familiar.' I was about to leave when she asked, 'You were here a few days ago, right?' That’s when I discovered you had been wounded earlier, evacuated by 669 to Sheba, returned to combat, and were now wounded again.' Noga and Guy got married in Kibbutz Shefayim on Tu B'Shvat, on January 25, 2024. They debated for a long time whether to postpone the wedding due to the war but ultimately decided to go ahead with the original date. 'The guys from my unit were stationed inside Gaza, and there was serious doubt whether they could make it to the wedding,' Guy explains. Noga: 'They're like family to us. Our whole refrigerator door is covered with magnets of their pictures.' Guy: 'They were upset with me, saying, 'Aren’t we important enough for you to postpone the wedding for us?'' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: After speaking with everyone they could, Noga and Guy managed to arrange for the team to be pulled out of Gaza for the weekend to attend the wedding. That same week, a building collapse in the center of the Strip resulted in the deaths of 20 reservists. 'At the wedding, one of the guys told me, 'We intended to film a short video for you, but after spending all night extracting bodies from the collapsed building, we had no energy left to make it.'' Noga and Guy spent their wedding night at a hotel in Shefayim. When they booked rooms for their family before the war, they had no idea the hotel would later be used as accommodation for displaced from Kibbutz Kfar Aza. They also didn’t realize that Kfar Aza would become an integral part of their life story. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s1uzdidx1l	2024-11-29T12:53:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/25/B1xJbC5kYA/B1xJbC5kYA_2_0_1919_1080_0_small.jpg
ICC prosecutor recommends rejecting Israel's appeal against Netan...	Karim Khan submitted a document to the ICC Appeals Chamber, recommending the rejection of Israel's request regarding the Netanyahu and Gallant, stating that 'the decision is procedural and does not directly concern the court's jurisdiction' The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, has requested the dismissal of Israel's appeal against arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, arguing that the appeal does not meet the criteria for direct appeal under the Rome Statute. Khan argues that the decision in question is procedural and does not directly address the court's jurisdiction, making it non-appealable under the Rome Statute. He stated that the decision pertains to the timing and verification of Israel’s appeal, not the court’s authority. 'The pretrial chamber is the appropriate forum to address this issue,' he noted. The prosecutor has asked to dismiss Israel’s appeal and its request to suspend the arrest warrants issued by the pretrial chamber due to procedural inadmissibility. On Wednesday, Israel submitted two documents to the ICC’s appeals chamber in response to the arrest warrants.

Government's plan to facilitate the return of northern residents	Evacuated residents return on February 1 with grants based on family size; the government will also assist in rebuilding and revitalizing affected communities, and the state will finance housing for displaced residents until reconstruction are complete Yossi Shelly, the director-general of the Prime Minister’s Office, is set to present a comprehensive plan for the return of northern residents to their homes, according to a report on Friday. The proposal is expected to be submitted for government approval at its upcoming meeting in Nahariya. Under the plan, residents are scheduled to begin returning on February 1, incentivized by financial grants tailored to family size. For instance, an average family of two parents and four children would receive approximately 60,000 shekels, while couples without children could be eligible for grants of 20,000 to 25,000 shekels. Those returning later will receive reduced amounts, as the state will cover the cost of their temporary housing in hotels or rented apartments until their return. The process will be gradual, to complete the return by the end of the academic year on July 1. The government will also assist in rebuilding and revitalizing affected communities. Residents whose homes were destroyed, such as in Metula and Nahariya, will receive additional financial aid beyond existing compensation funds. The state will finance housing for displaced residents until reconstruction or renovations are complete, with clear timelines established for the recovery process. Initial assessments reveal extensive damage: over 500 homes were completely destroyed, and another 1,000 sustained varying levels of damage. Rebuilding costs are estimated at 1.5 billion shekels, with an additional 2 billion shekels required for renovations. The plan also calls for significant investment in restoring public infrastructure, including roads, parks, and fences.

The one-time grants are calculated based on the date residents cease state-funded temporary accommodations and the number of children eligible for child allowances. Those not housed in hotels will still qualify for grants if eligible for daily return or relocation allowances. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkgq1owq1e	2024-11-29T11:21:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/27/rkGTwR9VQke/rkGTwR9VQke_0_130_1280_720_0_small.jpg
Ukraine's Zelensky: offering Ukraine NATO membership could stop '...	President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview broadcast on Friday that offering Ukraine NATO membership while allowing Russia to keep for the moment territory it had captured could be a solution to end the 'hot stage' of the 33-month-old war. 'No one has offered us to be in NATO for one part or another part of Ukraine. The fact is, it is a solution to stop the hot stage of the war because we can just give NATO membership to the part of Ukraine that is under our control,' Zelensky told Sky News. 'But the invitation must be given to Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. You can't give an invitation to just one part of a country.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syssi5dxkg	2024-11-29T10:32:19-08:00	
Report: Death toll rises to 277 in clashes between Syrian rebels ...	The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition group to Assad's regime based in London, reported Friday that 277 people have been killed in clashes between rebel forces and Assad's military, two days after the rebels launched a surprise attack. The majority of the casualties were rebels and Syrian soldiers, but the UN confirmed that at least 27 civilians were killed, including eight children. According to the Observatory, the rebels have taken control of five neighborhoods in Aleppo and the city of Saraqib in the Idlib region.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy1eakwxyg	2024-11-29T09:55:59-08:00	
Netanyahu to convene security meeting amid Syria developments	The PM will hold a meeting with top security officials to discuss the ongoing battles between rebel forces and Assad’s army; 'Any instability in a neighboring country could impact us, but there may also be opportunities' Israeli officials say Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold a special security phone meeting on Friday with top security officials to discuss the developments in Syria, where fighting continues between rebel forces and Assad's army, and the implementation of the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon that took effect two days ago. Israel is closely monitoring the situation in Syria as rebel forces are fighting along the Syrian-Iranian axis and threatening the Assad regime. Israeli officials say, 'This is something we need to follow closely to see how it develops.' They also note, 'It’s not necessarily something that will affect us in the short term, but any instability in a neighboring country could impact us. It appears there may even be opportunities for change here.' In northern Syria, battles between rebel forces and Assad’s army continued this morning, two days after a surprise offensive launched by the rebels. The rebel attack in the northern provinces of Aleppo and Idlib is the largest against the Syrian army since 2020 when a ceasefire was declared in the region. Reports indicate that the rebels are advancing in rural areas of these provinces, with 14,000 residents displaced by the fighting. Meanwhile, Israel is also tracking the ceasefire's implementation in Lebanon. The IDF struck Hezbollah operatives for the second time in a day, after identifying the movement of a truck-mounted launcher.

Hezbollah chief says group scored 'divine victory' in war against...	Naim Qassem, the successor of Hassan Nasrallah, spoke for the first time since the ceasefire saying 'The agreement is under Lebanese sovereignty, and we defeated the enemy because it was forced to justify it'; Qassem claimed a historic victory as 'One of the signs of the enemy's defeat is that our people are returning to their homes, while its settlers are not' The head of the Lebanese terror group Hezbollah, Naim Qassem, said in a televised address on Friday that the group had scored a 'divine victory' against Israel even greater than that declared after the two foes last fought in 2006. Nearly 14 months after Hezbollah began launching rockets into Israel as part of a 'supportive front for Gaza,' during which the group's slain leader, Hassan Nasrallah, stated that the fire would not cease until the fighting in Gaza stopped, Qassem opened his remarks by declaring Hezbollah’s decision to stand by the Palestinians. He asserted that Hezbollah did not want war, but felt a 'religious and humanitarian obligation' to support Gaza. 'We repeated that we do not want war, but we are ready for one if Israel forces it upon us.' Qassem claimed, 'We are on the verge of a divine victory, greater than the victory of 2006.' He added, 'The war began with the goal of destroying Hezbollah, returning civilians to the North, and building a new Middle East. Israel expected to achieve its objectives quickly after striking our leadership and capabilities. Hezbollah managed to stand firm on the frontlines and began hitting Israel’s internal front.' He further said, 'The resistance has proven through this war that it is prepared, and Nasrallah’s plans were effective and accounted for all developments. Israel gambled on internal conflicts, but that gamble failed due to cooperation (in Lebanon, Hezbollah). The resilience of the resistance shocked the world, frightened the Israeli army, and brought despair to the enemy.' Regarding the ceasefire reached under UN Security Council Resolution 1701, Qassem stated, 'The agreement is under Lebanese sovereignty, and the resistance is present on the ground. We hold our heads high because we have the right to defend ourselves. One of the signs of the enemy’s defeat is that our people are returning, while settlers are not returning on the other side.' In response to criticism in Israel about the end of the fighting, Qassem said, 'We defeated the enemy because it had to justify the agreement.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: As reported by Arab media outlets, the agreement includes 'the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon,' meaning that only the Lebanese army will be authorized to carry weapons. 'The coordination between the resistance and the Lebanese army will be at the highest level,' Qassem stated. 'No one is betting on a disagreement between us. The primary focus of the agreement is south of the Litani River, which confirms the Israeli military's withdrawal from all areas it occupied.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1qlhupxyx	2024-11-29T08:45:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/29/S1D92DwXkl/S1D92DwXkl_89_0_950_535_0_small.jpg

Actor, disabled IDF veteran explains why he enlisted in reserve d...	As an IDF veteran with a disability, Dean Miroshnikov was not obligated to enlist for reserve duty, yet, a year ago, he entered Gaza, far from his restaurants and bars in Tel Aviv; 'I see the world as divided between good and evil, and I understand we must protect our place,' he says in an interview, explaining why he feels most on edge during his time off at home Forget the polished and sharp image of actor and model Dean Miroshnikov, known for his roles in numerous TV shows and films. Over the past year, Miroshnikov has traded in his suits for IDF uniforms. In December, he volunteered for the 'Magen Be'eri' Battalion (a group of veterans from elite IDF units). Since then, he's been far removed from his business ventures in Tel Aviv, including Noama, Oyster Club, and Berlin Café, which are located in the bustling nightlife center of Nachalat Binyamin. On October 7, Miroshnikov was in South Africa filming a movie. But just a month later, he was back in Israel amid the war, and within weeks, he was in uniform, without hesitation. By December, his battalion entered Gaza, rebuilding it from the ground up. He spent most of the summer in Rafah, Gaza, with occasional short breaks at home. For almost a year, Gaza and the West Bank have been his everyday sights, though he occasionally returns for a brief respite. He spends his time off with his wife, Ani Miroshnikov, but even while holding her hand in the streets of Tel Aviv, he remains alert. In professional terms, this is called PTSD. 'When I'm in Gaza, I have a narrow field of vision. I don't need to look behind because I know someone is covering me. But when I'm walking in Tel Aviv, I always check 360 degrees, looking both ways and behind. I hold my wife’s hand and look right, then left. We were surprised once at Berlin Café during a terrorist attack in the summer of 2023, where a city security officer was killed. I feel the danger everywhere. So, when I return from reserve duty and enter the city center, the tension intensifies. I don't want to be caught off guard.' How do you transition from fighting in the heart of Gaza or operations in the West Bank to the bustling center of Tel Aviv? 'One of the reasons I serve in the reserves is because of what I see in the West Bank. Every night, we arrest people trying to harm us, infiltrate the country, and carry out attacks. If my team and I can stop even ten terrorists who could have reached Nachalat Binyamin to carry out attacks, that’s why I do it. One of my business partners, Uri Ziman, volunteers with Tel Aviv’s emergency response team; he does all the necessary training. When I return to Nachalat Binyamin and sit in the corner of the restaurant with my wife and friends, I don’t want it to end. I want tourists to keep coming to Israel. Even when I’m on reserve duty, I stay updated on everything happening with our restaurants. I’m in all the business WhatsApp groups, seeing how every missile fired from Lebanon or anywhere else is destroying businesses. There are days when people are too scared to go out, and that empties the restaurant both that evening and the next day.' Is there another place you'd consider calling home? Miroshnikov, 36, was born in Ukraine and immigrated to Israel at the age of nine. He has spent the past six years traveling across the country, giving motivational talks to youth. He’s about to celebrate his 1,000th lecture. As a disabled IDF veteran, Miroshnikov was not required to serve. In 2010, while serving in Shayetet 13, he was injured during the Gaza flotilla raid. Fourteen years have passed since that day, but the memories remain vivid. 'The reason I share my story with students is that I turned it into a tool,' says Miroshnikov. 'I had PTSD that used to take over and make me angry at the world. I was ashamed to go to therapy and ask for help. But eventually, I did, and I’m still in the process. At some point, someone suggested I give lectures. They heard I was an actor and had served in Shayetet. The first time I spoke, I told the story of the Mavi Marmara. From there, I built a lecture where I explained what happened, but also what it’s like to be an immigrant in Israel and why serving in the IDF was important to me. PTSD is about disorganized thoughts, but when I build a story and know exactly what happened from the moment we were called to the helicopter, it helps. I bring order to my thoughts, and when I tell the story, I feel like I’m turning on a light switch. I turn it on, and by the end of the lecture, I switch it off and don’t think about it anymore. I think we’re all living in a post-trauma state as a nation. If someone feels the need to talk to someone, that’s okay. It doesn’t always have to be a psychologist; sometimes writing it down or recording and listening later can help too.' You volunteered to go to war, even though as a disabled veteran, you weren’t obligated. What was your motivation? 'Listen, no one is obligated. Some people tell me straight to my face, ‘I don’t care, I’m not enlisting.’ But what about my commander, a 49-year-old man with a business, a family, and kids? Does he have to enlist in the war? He came here, didn’t sleep at night, and we went into villages to do what needed to be done. If we don’t do this, there won’t be a country.' Miroshnikov’s motivation changes depending on the situation. 'At first, I said there’s no way I’m not going to be part of this. I’m a commando, and I do whatever is needed, especially when soldiers are lacking. I won’t sit on the sidelines in a situation like this. Now, I’m here for my friends in the battalion, for the people who get to go home once in a while.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I made Aliyah because there’s no other home for us. We came from Ukraine to Ashdod. I see the world divided between good and evil, and I understand that we need to protect this place. Otherwise, that spot on the map will be covered with black dust, and the Middle East will be lost. We strike in Syria, Lebanon, Iran, and Gaza. We protect the good and the beautiful heart that has to keep beating. If we don’t, the world will go mad.' Where do you find your optimism? 'Last week, on one of the nights, we went on an attack mission in the West Bank. Before that, we toured Jewish and Palestinian villages. Suddenly, we saw a group of girls in one of the moshavim. Without thinking twice, we jumped out of the jeep and danced with them. They recognized me, and the whole team burst out laughing. It was a joyful moment, and it gave us incredible energy before heading out on a mission. We felt we had brightened the day of those we were about to protect. That’s an amazing power. Then I came back to Tel Aviv, to my restaurants in Nachalat Binyamin, proud, knowing deep down that I did something good. It’s an incredible feeling.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rjn3bvpxye	2024-11-29T07:37:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/28/H1gOF3gI7Jg/H1gOF3gI7Jg_0_117_768_433_0_small.jpg

Saudi Arabia abandons pursuit of US defense treaty over Israel st...	Saudi Arabia has shifted from seeking a full US defense treaty to a scaled-down military pact, tying normalization with Israel to concrete progress on Palestinian statehood; Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman initially sought a two-state solution pledge but renewed demands amid Israel’s actions in Gaza Saudi Arabia has abandoned its pursuit of an ambitious defense treaty with Washington in return for normalizing relations with Israel. It is now pushing for a more modest military cooperation agreement, two Saudi and four Western officials told Reuters. In a drive to get a wide-ranging mutual security treaty over the line earlier this year, Riyadh softened its position on Palestinian statehood, telling Washington that a public commitment from Israel to a two-state solution could be enough for the Gulf kingdom to normalize relations. But with public anger in Saudi Arabia and the wider Middle East at fever pitch over Israel's military actions in Gaza, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has again made recognition of Israel conditional on it taking concrete steps to create a Palestinian state, two Saudi and three Western sources said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is still eager to secure normalization with the Saudi powerhouse as a historical milestone and a sign of broader acceptance in the Arab world, Western diplomats said. But he faces overwhelming opposition at home to any concessions to the Palestinians following the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks and knows any gesture in the direction of statehood would fracture his ruling coalition, they said. With both leaders shackled by their domestic powerbases, Riyadh and Washington hope a more modest defense pact could be sealed before President Joe Biden leaves the White House in January, the sources said. A full-blown U.S.-Saudi treaty would need to pass the U.S. Senate with a two-thirds majority - and this would be a non-starter unless Riyadh recognizes Israel, the six sources said. The pact now under discussion would involve expanding joint military exercises and drills to address regional threats, mainly from Iran. It would foster partnerships between U.S. and Saudi defense firms, with safeguards to prevent collaboration with China, the sources said. The agreement would promote Saudi investment in advanced technologies, especially drone defense. The U.S. would increase its presence in Riyadh through training, logistics, and cyber security support, and may deploy a Patriot missile battalion to enhance missiledefensee and integrated deterrence. But it would not be the kind of binding mutual defense treaty that would oblige U.S. forces to protect the world's biggest oil exporter in the event of foreign attack. 'Saudi Arabia will get a security deal which will allow more military cooperation and sales of U.S. weapons, but not a defense treaty similar to that of Japan or South Korea as initially sought,' said Abdelaziz al-Sagher, head of the Gulf Research Institute think-tank in Saudi Arabia. The Trump dilemma The picture is complicated further, however, by the impending arrival of Donald Trump in the White House. While Trump's plan to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict excludes any provisions for Palestinian statehood or sovereignty, he is a close ally of the Saudi crown prince. Palestinian and some Arab officials worry that Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner - architect of the 'Deal of the Century' and also a close ally of the crown prince - may ultimately persuade him to support the plan. How the prince reconciles Saudi priorities with this shifting diplomatic landscape will be pivotal, defining both his leadership and the future of the peace process, diplomats said. The current U.S. administration has not given up hope for a deal on security guarantees before Biden leaves office in January, but several obstacles remain. One person in Washington familiar with the talks said there was reason to be skeptical about whether there was enough time to strike a deal. U.S. officials are mindful that the kingdom is still interested in formally cementing the guarantees it has been seeking, especially to gain access to more advanced weapons, but are uncertain whether it would prefer to get it done under Biden, or wait for Trump, the source said. 'We continue to discuss and have many lines of effort on the table (with the Saudis),' the U.S. official said. The White House National Security Council declined to comment when asked about efforts toward reaching a deal on U.S. security guarantees for Saudi Arabia. Netanyahu's office declined to comment when asked about the Saudi position on Palestinian statehood. A defense treaty giving Saudi Arabia U.S. military protection in exchange for recognizing Israel would reshape the Middle East by uniting two long-time foes and binding Riyadh to Washington at a time when China is making inroads in the region. It would allow the kingdom to shore up its security and ward off threats from Iran and its Houthi allies, to avoid a repeat of the 2019 strikes on its oil facilities, which Riyadh and Washington both blamed on Tehran. Iran has denied any role. A senior Saudi official said the treaty was 95% complete but Riyadh opted to discuss an alternative agreement, given it was not doable without normalization with Israel. Depending on the format, a scaled-down cooperation agreement could be approved without going through Congress before Biden leaves office, two of the sources said. There were other stumbling blocks in the negotiations to secure a mutual defense treaty. For instance, there was no progress in the talks about civil nuclear cooperation because Saudi Arabia refused to sign a so-called 123 Agreement with the U.S. that would have denied Riyadh the right to nuclear enrichment, the six sources said. Saudi objections to articles related to human rights proved to be another area of disagreement, one Saudi source close to the talks told Reuters. 'The big prize' While the Saudi leadership strongly advocates Palestinian statehood, it remains uncertain, according to diplomats, how the crown prince would respond if Trump revives the deal he floated in 2020 to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The plan marks a dramatic shift in U.S. policy and international agreements by overtly aligning with Israel and deviating sharply from the long-standing land-for-peace framework that has historically guided negotiations. It would allow Israel to annex vast stretches of land in the occupied West Bank, including Israeli settlements and the Jordan Valley, and recognize Jerusalem as the 'undivided capital of Israel' - effectively denying Palestinian claims to East Jerusalem as their capital, a central aspiration in their statehood goals and accordance with U.N. resolutions. By legitimizing Israeli annexations, the Trump plan is viewed by many as a severe blow to the two-state solution and Palestinian hopes of statehood. Saudi officials insist that the creation of a Palestinian state by previous international agreements, including East Jerusalem as its capital, remains an essential condition for long-term regional peace and stability. Without it the cycle of violence will continue to jeopardize any normal relations, they say. 'How can we imagine a region integrated if we sidestep the Palestinian issue?' a senior Saudi official said. 'You can't prevent the Palestinian right to self-determination.' And in some of the harshest criticism of Israel since the start of the Gaza war, Crown Prince Mohammed called Israel's military actions in Gaza 'collective genocide' in his address to an Arab and Islamic summit in Riyadh this month. The potential for Saudi normalization with Israel, however, could be revisited in the future, perhaps once the dust settles after the Gaza war - and possibly under a different Israeli government, diplomats said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Fawaz Gerges, a Middle East expert at the London School of Economics, said Trump would leverage all possible avenues to secure historic normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel. 'For Trump, Saudi Arabia is the big prize,' said Gerges. 'As to how normalization could happen despite repeated Saudi leader's insistence they will not recognize Israel until a real path to a Palestinian state is set, Trump could promise a ceasefire in Gaza in return for normalization and tentative promise to support a Palestinian state, without obliging Israel to make any real concessions to the Palestinians.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj00qjuvxje	2024-11-29T05:42:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/02/05/rk4HPsA96/rk4HPsA96_119_1098_2571_1447_0_small.jpg

Wiz will be the biggest company of its field in the world: Top fe...	In an exclusive interview, Wiz's CMO & VP of Product Strategy forecasts how the cybersecurity company will eclipse its competition, why it was wrong to accept Google's lavish purchase offer, why connections with the group of founders is considered an opportunity and how she learned to embrace failure Raaz Herzberg met Assaf Rappaport by chance on a shuttle bus. A short time later, she was the one who saved Wiz for him, when she made it clear that the startup he founded would not go far unless it significantly changed direction - and the rest is history. In her first interview, CMO & VP Product Strategy at Wiz tells how the company will be the biggest in the world in the field, why it was wrong to accept Google's lavish purchase offer, why the connection with the group of founders is considered an opportunity rather than deprivation, and how she learned to embrace failure Raaz Herzberg, 32, started her journey at Wiz, the successful Israeli cyber startup, on a shuttle bus. She worked as a product manager at Microsoft Israel, traveling there by bus. One morning she sat down next to Assaf Rappaport, then Microsoft Israel's CEO. 'I sat down next to him simply because there was no other seat available,' says Herzberg. 'He is very friendly, so we started talking.' 'Raaz sat next to me,' Rappaport recalls, 'we didn't know each other, but she was full of amazing ideas about what could be improved at the company. That meeting resulted in establishing an excellence program for young product managers. Since then, we had many opportunities to talk about security issues, and whenever I had doubts I would go to consult with her.' Rappaport was already an experienced entrepreneur and an admired manager. He reached the top at Microsoft management after in 2015 Microsoft acquired his cybersecurity company Adallom for $320 million, which he co-founded with his three partners, Yinon Costica, Ami Luttwak and Roy Reznik. In 2019, when the four decided to move on and founded Wiz, Herzberg, the 27-year-old product manager from that chance meeting on the bus, was their first hired employee. To a large extent, that decision saved their company. 'I was hired to serve as a product manager at Wiz, reporting to Yinon,' Herzberg recalls. 'It was during the COVID lockdowns, and we used the time talking to senior information security managers in organizations, who were our potential customers. We gave them presentations, ten a day, and asked for feedback. I remember presenting them the network security problem we intended to solve, while I heard on the other side of the line an American guy saying, ‘It sounds great'.' 'After spending ten days in such conversations, as a product manager I was supposed to go to product developers, telling them 'this is what needs to be built,' but then I realized that I had no idea what I was asking them to build. It was frustrating because the conversations were too general, and I couldn't see what the solution was supposed to look like in detail.' Herzberg realized that the security product offered by Wiz, which had just been established, was not appealing to the customers because it did not address a different problem the customers were previously facing. She didn't hesitate to put forth her dramatic conclusion to Costica, telling him gently that the company he had started was not heading in the right direction.

She didn't hesitate to put forth her dramatic conclusion to Costica, telling him gently that the company he had started was not heading in the right direction. She has just joined the company but listened to our conversations and told us: 'I don't understand what a difficult problem the product solves for our customers and why it is important,'' Costica said in an interview with Calcalist last year. 'She was the first to alert that the product was not going in the right direction.' Rappaport also remembers this key moment: 'It was at the very beginning, when we still called ourselves 'Beyond Networks' with a completely different idea. Raaz sat with us, the founding team, she felt like the dumbest one in the room, and the only one who didn't understand why the idea to start the company was good, and assumed that the problem was with her, while in fact it was with us. In retrospect, thanks to her we changed direction.' What made you decide to say to the founding members that they were heading in the wrong direction? After the conversations I held, I could tell the difference between a customer who is saying 'It sounds interesting, we will catch up later', and a customer who is saying 'Wow, how much does it cost? I will connect you with my team', says Herzberg. 'Once I realized that none of us really fully understood what we were doing, we decided to make a sharp turn and move to engage in cloud security. We called it 'a suicide act' because it meant that we had to go to organizations who already had first-generation solution for cloud security, for which they have already paid, and we also knew that we would have to meet much higher standards, to have them purchase our product instead.' Weren't you afraid? 'The organizational climate here allows every employee to express their opinion and say things like, 'it doesn’t make sense to me'. It's like family, where you feel comfortable to say whatever crosses your mind, knowing that they are on your side.' Many excellent companies remain private for a long time, such as OpenAI. Herzberg is CMO & VP Product Strategy at Wiz, responsible for a team of 50 people. She is the most senior woman at the young cybersecurity company, which is growing at an unprecedented rate for an Israeli company, and perhaps globally. Five years since its establishment, Wiz's revenues reached half a billion dollars, its cloud security solution is used by 45 of the Fortune100, and just six months ago it raised $1 billion at an unimaginable $12 billion valuation. But an even bigger drama occurred this July, when Wiz rejected Google's $23 billion acquisition offer. How can you say No to such an offer? 'Generally speaking, without referring specifically to Google, the sales in the cloud infrastructure security market in 2023 were about $550 billion. In 2024, it’s expected to grow to $680 billion. The market is growing at a crazy pace, we are close to its growth and fully believe in our ability to become the biggest company in the world in this field. It’s big, and it's not worth giving it up for any purchase offer.' Even if it’s $23 billion? 'CrowdStrike (which provides endpoint security) is worth today $75 billion, Palo Alto Networks (which engages in network security) is worth $120 billion. I believe we’ll be bigger because the cloud market is going to be bigger, and we have strong indications that our solution is the right one.' Some say that the valuation is overestimated. 'When Wiz raises funds, investors review its activity carefully, so they know that we are selling a solution to the most critical problem in the security market today. I'm highly familiar with the cloud security world and have engaged in the field for a decade, but today only 15% of organizations use the cloud. This means that we've just begun. Wiz has infinite potential, and that’s why, for now, we prefer to remain private.' We? 'All the founders at Wiz believe that it should remain private. An IPO could be an amazing and exciting stop along the way, but still, it’s just a stop.' So, when will you become public? 'We will not remain private forever, but there is no pressure. We managed to raise enough money, which allows us to go public when the time is right. In recent years, we see more and more excellent companies that remain private for a long time, and the private market knows how to support and finance them. Take OpenAI for example, and other companies that have raised billions and could have already launched an IPO.' Assaf Rappaport said he would consider IPO when you’d reach around a billion dollars in sales. You're halfway there. 'That’s definitely the goal, but there’s no rush.' Bloomberg reported that you're in discussions to sell existing shares at a valuation as high as $20 billion. Is this a fundraising round that hasn't been completed and was disclosed too soon? I don’t comment on speculation. When a round is completed, we provide updates.' 'I didn’t serve in IDF's Intelligence Unit 8200 and felt underqualified' Herzberg’s journey to the heart of the cybersecurity industry did not follow the typical path. She served in the IDF in a technology unit after pursuing science and math majors in high school, 'where there were scarcely three girls in the class.' When she finished her military service, she did not opt for R&D or Computer Science. 'I didn’t want to work in high-tech and enrolled in economics and law studies at the Hebrew University. The truth is, I didn’t serve in the IDF's intelligence (prestigious) unit 8200, so I didn’t think I was qualified.' So, what happened? 'What happened was that waitressing was exhausting, and salaries in the tech sector are much higher. The truth is that I tried several times to move away from high-tech, and besides I have natural talent for painting, but in Israel there is tendency to work in the tech industry. 'I didn't want to do something purely technological, but when I started working at Ginger Software (which develops an AI-powered writing assistant), I saw the magic of a start-up where half the staff were linguists. That's the beauty of using technology as a tool to empower a different field. 'In the end, I enrolled in a demanding joint program of Computer Science at the university and Design studies at Bezalel Academy of Art and Design. During my studies I worked part time at Google as a software programmer, and then I moved to work at Microsoft as a product manager.' Studying for a dual degree while working at Google isn't an easy task. 'I completed my computer science duties, but haven't completed the degree at Bezalel due to workload. But during my studies, I managed to engage in many projects that combined the two fields.' So, you gave up painting? 'I painted in many formats over the years, and while working at Wiz I returned to engage in hyper-realistic oil painting. I studied once a week with the painter Erez Aharon, but recently, unfortunately, I can't find the time.' You ended up in high-tech by chance? 'I finished my studies and felt somewhat confused, finding myself interested in many fields. If by any chance the tech industry ceases to exist tomorrow, there would still be many things that fascinate me. Sometimes I regret not going to law school. 'Public advocacy also appeals to me. I’d love to bring reform to Israel Railways; I've traveled by train from Haifa to Tel Aviv for 12 years and the experience hasn’t changed to this day. My dream is to turn that ride into a 20-minute trip, like you see in other places around the world.' 'I was completely overwhelmed, my legs were shaking' Despite her lack of experience, Rappaport asked Herzberg to lead the company's global marketing team. 'We had two very good American marketing managers in Silicon Valley, but we didn't feel that it was working. Then two years ago Assaf told me, 'I need you in marketing.' I found it somewhat absurd and replied that I was too busy; it made no sense to me, but he believed in me.' Despite the lack of self-confidence that she describes, Herzberg effectively became the fifth informal co-founder at Wiz, who is involved in every decision-making. Moreover, she is also the highest compensated employee in terms of the value of her stock options in the company. What was the marketing problem that demanded your help? 'Wiz had an excellent product that customers didn’t know about. Each time we reached a new potential customer, they would say, 'It’s a shame we haven’t heard about you before, we already purchased another security product'. No one heard of Wiz, and that was a problem.' And what did you do? 'First we addressed the visual issue. I don't believe in fear-based marketing, using black or red colors. That's why at conferences we would use pink or light blue. At the RSA conference, where all the security companies participate and you have to pay a million dollars just to get space at the exhibition, I wanted everyone at the conference to pay attention to us. So, we built a stand with a 'Wizard of Oz' concept ('Wiz of Oz'), and since then we've been using similar marketing strategies.' How do you attract and preserve large customers? 'There's an inside joke of cybersecurity, saying that founders of big cybersecurity companies live on airplanes because they spend all their time meeting customers. These deals are worth millions of dollars, and the founders want to understand their customers and their needs in depth. So, it is necessary to meet the customers yourself – and it turned out that I became a significant 'force multiplier'. It was surprising, first and foremost, to me.' What are your success metrics as a marketing manager? 'In the past we had 30,000 followers on LinkedIn, and now we have 250,000. There's also an increase in the number of searches for the product, and, of course, in the number of deals closed in the past two years. Analysts who three years ago could write about cloud security without mentioning us, can no longer ignore us.' If you're so evaluated, why aren’t you a formal fifth co-founder in this 'boys’ club'? 'They knew me when I was just an employee at Microsoft but knew nothing about my capabilities. We didn’t have the kind of relationship that we have today. They’re a decade older than me, they are more experienced, and they asked me to do things at Wiz on a scale I’d never done before. We were all pleasantly surprised by my achievements, especially me. 'To some extent they took a risk having me; they would invite me to meetings from the beginning, making me feel comfortable to share my opinion, allowing me to speak with the biggest clients, unlike other companies, where the founders are the only ones allowed to speak to clients in the first two years. It’s really not obvious.' What did you discover about yourself? 'At Microsoft, I didn't do things on such a scale, and I was always accompanied by staff members. At Wiz, everything started from scratch. Ahead of discussing with one of the first big customers, they told me, 'we want you to close the terms of the agreement with this customer.' I was completely overwhelmed, my legs were shaking. 'When I was discussing with the security manager of a giant company, he started talking about what the contract should include for ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) purposes. I had no idea what he was talking about, so I texted Assaf while we were still talking, asking 'what is ARR?' We keep the screenshot of this text message to this day. That discussion became our company heritage.' Don’t you feel like working in a 'boys' club' or a sense of regret that you didn’t establish a startup yourself? 'It doesn’t feel like 'boys' club' here. Ami is a national religious Jew, Yinon and Assaf have male partners - it’s a diversified workplace. I don't feel like I have to be 'one of the crowd'. I have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be part of an exciting journey, at a company growing faster than any other in the world in terms of sales. I feel a deep sense of belonging and pride, and the title matters less to me. Will I start my own company in the future? Who knows.' And what will happen in the next company they establish? 'If they start a third company and don’t offer me to be a co-founder, that’s a different story. We've been engaging in the cloud industry to begin with; if customers want the best, they will come to us.' Let’s talk about competition. You’re talking about making Wiz the biggest company in the field, but you’re still far from your top competitors such as CrowdStrike and certainly Palo Alto, which has annual sales of $8 billion 'These are amazing companies, leaders in their field, but CrowdStrike is an endpoint security company, and Palo Alto is a network company. Most of their revenues come from these areas, and they were founded long before the cloud. Wiz is a cloud company. The market that Wiz wants to lead - the cloud security market - is larger than the endpoint or even network markets.' But the competing companies understand this too, this is why they acquired cloud security companies. 'In terms of cloud, we beat them, because their solution wasn’t formed for the cloud - it’s not their forte. H&M, for example, is a clothing chain that also started selling some furniture. That’s fine, but if you want the best furniture, you go to a furniture store.' There's a word get around that you’re selling packages at a loss to increase market share. 'If you ask people what’s bad about Wiz, they’ll say we are more expensive than our competitors. I’ll say again, the cloud has turned everything upside down. It’s the biggest revolution ever in the security field.' Did you open a bottle of champagne when faulty CrowdStrike software update caused operating systems crash worldwide? 'Absolutely not, my heart went out to them. It was a sad day for the entire market. This is a great company, and I admire the endpoint security brand they've built. The goal of our industry is to protect organizations and help them.' My mom taught me that one should strengthen what one is lacking Herzberg grew up in Ramat Efal located in the center of Israel and she now lives in Tel Aviv with her partner. 'My father, Amir, is a professor of computer science, and my mother, Nava, is a math teacher.' One can say that your tech path seems to have come from home. 'So it seems; but for both of my parents, who are divorced, hard work is more important than talent. My mother has a strong educational principle - one should strengthen what one is lacking.' How was that reflected in your upbringing? 'I have natural talent for painting. I've been really good at it since kindergarten, but my mom never felt the need to enroll me in a program to improve my painting skills. Instead, she sent me to Scouts and swimming classes - things that were harder for me. If it were up to me, I’d lock myself in a room, paint and read books. But my mom’s approach was 'wherever you're uncomfortable, that’s where you need to push yourself'.' Has it helped you throughout your career? Are you doing something today that you thought you would never do? 'I learned to put the fear aside and try, I wouldn't decide in advance that something is not for me. It's a default for girls to feel that they're not smart or good enough to do things, but I learned to put these feelings aside. I'm really willing to take the risk of failing. When I took on marketing – while candidates for this role are typically chosen from the U.S. 'I wasn't afraid of failing. I still think that if it turns out that I am not the right person to lead Wiz marketing, that would be fine by me. Failure is always deemed a bad thing, but in my view there is courage in flunking a challenging exam.' Why? 'People keep asking 'why aren’t there more women in the cyber industry,' and I’ve encountered one of the reasons for it throughout my life. Take high school for example; a girl who thinks she’ll get a C in the most challenging matriculation exam, will give up and go for the easier exam to get a higher score. 'Women who take computer science at university are doing great, but there are few of them, and women who were about to finish their degree with a score of 75 (C+) or lower, would quit, because of their high standards and perfectionism.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israeli politician Gideon Sa'ar (MK for New Hope party), in contrast, had no problem thinking that he could be Defense Minister without having significant military background. 'Exactly, and women are on the opposite end of the spectrum. These gaps start at a very early stage and are reflected in the industry. Even when I arrived at Wiz, I said to myself, 'They must have made a mistake in hiring me; these Adallom guys will probably fire me'.' That's how I really felt deep down, honestly. But over the years I've learned to say to myself, 'They believe in you, take the job. At worst, you'll fail'.' And what will you say to your daughter one day, so she doesn’t grow up feeling that way? 'I’ll tell her that failing on the most difficult exam is worth more than getting an A+ on an easier exam. This debilitating fear of failure is a characteristic of women. I know that's true because I’m still struggling it. I’m always sure I’m going to fail, but I’ve learned to ignore that inner voice. I’ve learned to embrace failure.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s18asksbke	2024-11-29T02:40:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/04/SygyRqS11yg/SygyRqS11yg_142_827_1626_916_0_small.jpg

IDF eliminates 40 terrorists, arrests 100 in ongoing Jabaliya rai...	Givati Brigade soldiers' work in one of Gaza's most dangerous locations moves to its third month, with experienced troops aiming to snuff any embers left of Hamas in the area The Givati Brigade’s Reconnaissance Unit successfully raided a large school complex in the heart of Gaza’s Jabaliya refugee camp, which consists of several multi-story buildings, in only three hours on Wednesday. The operation, carried out by a little over two platoons, resulted in the arrest of about 100 Hamas terrorists and the elimination of 40 others — 22 in close-range encounters and another 18 via airstrikes — all without any casualties among the soldiers. 'Less than a year ago, we would've deployed two or three brigades over several days for a divisional-level operation in such a location. Today, it's executed by a battle-tested battalion and a half against a terrorist organization that's being systematically defeated,' one of the operation's commanders told Ynet on Thursday. The Jabaliya raid is the longest IDF operation since forces transitioned to a new operational model favoring limited incursions into Gaza, with the IDF’s active ground maneuver phase having ended approximately 10 months ago. The raid, conducted by the 162nd Division, is now entering its third month. As anticipated early on, it's proving to be longer and different from previous operations. The reason lies in the IDF Southern Command's tactical shift: dividing the northern third of Gaza and encircling populated areas while filtering Gazan civilians fleeing southward toward Gaza City from Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists. The approach faced international criticism. However, the IDF has repeatedly stressed that there were no signs of starvation in Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya or Beit Hanoun. Just this week, Jordanian troops dropped aid packages in the Palestinian enclave. Further, Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), in cooperation with foreign bodies, held special operations to prepare humanitarian aid delivery for conflict zones. Dozens of aid trucks enter this area daily via Israel’s Erez border crossing. Southern Command’s spearhead division estimated the raid will likely continue for several more weeks, as Jabaliya’s stronghold still houses between 100 and 200 terrorists. According to military data, 1,500 terrorists have been killed in the raid so far — a significantly higher figure than in comparable raids or divisional attacks during the ground operation’s first phase. The data also reveals that approximately 1,200 terrorists have been captured and interrogated, with intelligence from these interrogations directly supporting the soldiers' progress in real-time. This intelligence provides new targets, locations of explosives and even the positions of combat tunnels still present in Gaza. Some of these interrogations take place in the field, conducted by Unit 504 investigators and Shin Bet agents. During Wednesday night’s raid, field investigators identified several Hamas company and platoon commanders among the detainees, who surrendered without resistance. 'We’re not reaching levels seen in the West Bank yet. We’re facing anti-tank fire and significant explosives, but the forces are learning from the extensive experience they’re gaining as time passes,' the IDF said. 'We’re achieving greater operational efficiency with fewer troops and are getting closer to fully defeating Jabaliya,' it added. In the past 48 hours alone, 80 terrorists have been eliminated and the IDF has managed to drive about 75,000 Gazans southward throughout the operation. The high numbers from Wednesday night’s operation were largely due to the forces’ surprising and deceptive maneuvers, as well as progress made by Kfir Brigade troops in Beit Lahia, marking the young infantry brigade’s most significant test to date. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The raid has so far involved around 1,500 airstrikes, some conducted during a period when the IDF had shifted its primary focus to Lebanon and had fewer aircraft available for operations in Gaza. 'Our goal is to provide complete safety to the residents of Netiv HaAsara, near Beit Lahia, or to the residents of Sderot, who can see Jabaliya from their balconies. Even if it’s challenging and will take more time, it’s being done thoroughly, systematically and methodically,' the IDF stressed. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1gj9wp7kx	2024-11-29T01:21:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/28/SkZnqirI7yl/SkZnqirI7yl_0_297_961_540_0_small.jpg

12,500 targets, 100 special operations: IDF tallies Hezbollah con...	Military report details over a year of fighting against terror group during which it seized military intelligence, eliminated Hezbollah commanders and struck thousands of targets The IDF published on Friday a summary of the prolonged conflict with Hezbollah, which ended this week with a cease-fire agreement after nearly 14 months. While ground operations in the Gaza Strip are expected to continue for years, the IDF Northern Command is preparing for ongoing cease-fire enforcement strikes and warning fire until Lebanese Army forces complete their deployment south of the Litani River, allowing Israeli forces to gradually withdraw and return to Israel. According to military data, 121,000 communication devices, computers and electronic devices, along with documents, were seized and confiscated in Lebanon during dozens of covert operations preceding the two-month-long ground campaign that concluded earlier this week. Additionally, 13,000 anti-tank missile launchers, anti-aircraft rockets and missiles, as well as 12,000 explosives, UAVs and various explosive devices, were captured or destroyed. The military estimated that over 155,000 items were seized in total. The military assessed that Hezbollah holds less than 30% of its UAV fleet from before the war — still numbering several hundred. According to the IDF, at least 2,500 terrorists were confirmed to be eliminated, though the actual number is believed to be around 3,500 with twice as many injured. Officially, Lebanon has reported 3,961 fatalities, without distinguishing between civilians and combatants and another 16,520 injuries. Among those killed were Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, his designated successor Hashem Safieddine and 13 other senior figures. The fatalities include 4 division commanders, 24 brigade commanders, 27 battalion commanders and 63 company commanders. As part of the campaign against Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force, approximately 160 military headquarters, 150 weapons depots and over 1,500 terror infrastructure sites were destroyed. Overall, 1,600 Hezbollah military headquarters from various units and more than 1,000 weapons depots were targeted. The Israeli Air Force reported fighter jets flew 14,000 hours and attacked in 11,000 offensive sorties. In total, 360 terror infrastructures were attacked in Beirut and the Beqaa Valley alongside about 1,000 additional targets — out of 12,500 Hezbollah assets struck across Lebanon since October 8 of last year, with intensified efforts since August. The Navy held 25,000 hours of maritime operations off the coast of Lebanon. On the ground, 14 brigades participated in the campaign, alongside over 100 special operations and 24 divisional raids. Meanwhile, Israel continues to promise strict enforcement of the cease-fire agreement. On Thursday, the IDF announced it conducted its first airstrike since the cease-fire, after 'terrorist activity was identified in a facility used by Hezbollah to store mid-range rockets in southern Lebanon.'

Does Rawhi Fattouh have the support of the Palestinian people?	Maurice Hirsch: The PA has been 'entirely usurped by the PLO and its mechanisms' The individual whom Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has named as a temporary successor, who would take over from him should he die or leave his post, does not enjoy the support of the Palestinian people, according to Lt.-Col. (res.) Maurice Hirsch of the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs. He told ILTV on Thursday that Abbas’s appointment of the chairman of the Palestinian National Council, Rawhi Fattouh, someone who is not connected to the Palestinian Authority, is basically saying that the PA has ceased to exist. 'It has been entirely usurped by the PLO and its mechanisms,' Hirsch said. Hirsch added that Fattouh does not have popular support among the people. 'He's only being appointed, really, as a functionary for the interim period until new elections happen,' Hirsch said, although the Palestinians do not have a good track record of holding elections, and therefore, 'he will just assume this position for an unending period of time.'

In Aleppo countryside, the opposition turns the tables on the Syr...	For the first time in years, Syrian opposition groups have launched a significant military operation against regime forces, indicating a potential strategy shift for the diminished opposition The Aleppo countryside in Syria is witnessing a new military development as Syrian opposition factions and allied groups launched a surprise attack on positions held by Iranian forces and Syrian regime troops. The battles mark the first significant military operations between the opposition and the regime in northern Syria since the March 2020 cease-fire. In the early hours of Wednesday, opposition factions including the Sunni Islamist group Tahrir al-Sham launched the battles, ultimately capturing multiple villages and towns in the western Aleppo countryside. Among the spoils was the Syrian Army’s 46th Regiment military base, which had been subjected to near-daily shelling since the regime captured it in February 2020. At the time of this report, the factions are still engaged in battle. Special military sources told The Media Line that the opposition's factions captured approximately 10 individuals, including Russian personnel, and killed or injured dozens more. The Media Line obtained videos and photos showing 10 drones captured by the opposition groups, captured Syrian soldiers, and other captured fighters who opposition members identified as Russians. One military source from the Sham Legion, an alliance of Sunni Islamist rebel groups, said that several factions are participating in the operation, codenamed 'Deter the Aggression.' Participating groups include Tahrir al-Sham, Ahrar al-Sham, Jaysh al-Izza, the National Front for Liberation, the 50th Brigade of the Syrian National Army, and the Levant Front. The source, who asked to remain anonymous, said that the factions had captured approximately 25 military and civilian locations in the western Aleppo countryside, including Qubtan al-Jabal, Anjarah, Urm al-Sughra, Awijil, Sheikh Aqil, and Kafr Basin. These battles mark one of the most significant offensives in recent years, breaking a period of relative stagnation in Syria’s civil conflict. The front lines have remained largely static since President Bashar al-Assad’s government regained control of most of the country, bolstered by Russian military support. The renewed rebel offensive may indicate a shift in strategy aimed at increasing pressure on Assad’s forces in Aleppo, a region of critical strategic importance. While Assad’s government has retained control over much of Syria, this flare-up underscores the ongoing volatility of the conflict. Analysts suggest that the return of large-scale operations by opposition forces could reignite broader hostilities in areas that had seen a semblance of stability. More than 75 regime forces were killed in the battles, including officers. Opposition forces captured over 10 regime personnel and seized five tanks, an armored vehicle, and a missile storage depot. The opposition factions have not yet disclosed their casualty numbers. Another source close to the opposition factions said that more than 10 regime officers were killed in the ongoing clashes. Activists on social media shared photos suggesting that some of the fighters who were killed were affiliated with Hezbollah—photos show Lebanese currency in their clothes and images of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah they had brought to battle. The battles have triggered displacement in both opposition-held areas of the Idlib and Aleppo countrysides and regime-held parts of Aleppo city, especially as fighting approaches the city’s outskirts. Opposition factions are now less than 6 miles away from Aleppo city. Over 6 million civilians live in the Idlib and Aleppo countrysides under the control of the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army, Tahrir al-Sham, and other opposition factions. These areas are considered Syria’s last opposition strongholds. Khaled Mahmoud, a civilian from Aleppo, reported that residents of several of the city’s neighborhoods had moved deeper into the city’s interior, fearing clashes and civilian casualties in the event of opposition advances. Speaking to The Media Line, Mahmoud highlighted the dire humanitarian situation resulting from the displacement, made worse by harsh conditions and cold weather.

According to the Response Coordinators Team, a group associated with the opposition, over 8,735 families have fled from northwestern Syria. As clashes intensified in the Aleppo countryside, Syrian regime forces and Russian aircraft bombed parts of Idlib. Cluster munitions hit a camp in the northern countryside, killing a child and injuring three children and two women. Two additional people were injured in the town of Sarmin, east of Idlib. A source from the Syrian Civil Defense, the humanitarian group also known as the White Helmets, said that shelling targeted the industrial zone in Idlib, the village of Qaminas to the east, the village of Kansafra to the south, and the town of Sarmada in the northern countryside. School and university classes in Idlib were suspended following the attacks, and conferences and similar events were canceled.

Iran plans uranium-enrichment expansion at Natanz, Fordow, IAEA r...	Iran has informed the UN nuclear watchdog of plans to install more uranium-enriching centrifuges at its Fordow and Natanz plants as well as bring machines recently installed there online, a confidential report by the watchdog said on Thursday. The International Atomic Energy Agency report to member states seen by Reuters made no mention, however, of Iran's enrichment to up to 60% purity, close to nuclear weapons-grade. Eight new cascades, or clusters, of advanced IR-6 centrifuges at Fordow would enrich to up to 5% purity, Iran informed the IAEA.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r11uos8q1l	2024-11-28T10:59:01-08:00	
I'll never be the same kid I was': Munder family's lives one yea...	Ohad Munder and his mother Keren recount their first steps back home after their family was abducted to Gaza on October 7 and released in the first hostage deal Three generations of the Munder family were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7 last year: Avraham and Ruti, residents of the kibbutz, along with their daughter Keren and her son Ohad, who had come from Kfar Saba to visit for the Sukkot holiday. Keren’s brother, Roi, was murdered that day. Ruti, Keren and 10-year-old Ohad were released a year ago in the hostage release deal, while 79-year-old Avraham remained in Gaza. In August, his body was discovered in a tunnel in Khan Younis, recovered and returned to Israel, where he was laid to rest in the kibbutz he called home. Ohad Munder Zachri, now only ten years old, describes adjusting to a new normal. Old habits and hobbies have been left behind. 'I'll never be the same kid I was. I don’t go to school as much. I’ve also temporarily stopped attending the gifted students program. It’s hard for me to stay home alone, something I used to love,' he shares. 'We marked the day we returned—it’s a significant day for me. I returned from captivity, the most horrific and impactful experience of my life,' Ohad continues. Reflecting on the past year, he adds, 'This year has been incredibly complex.' He spent his ninth birthday on October 23, 2023, in Hamas captivity, a day when many Israelis flew balloons across the country in his honor. Keren recounts that even after returning from Gaza with her son, finding moments of peace has been difficult. 'I felt I needed to bring color and light into our home, so we decided to renovate. It was something to hold onto during those tough days waiting for my father,' she shares. 'There’s nothing we used to do regularly that we continue to do the same way. And if we do, it’s without the same joy. Nothing has healed—returning from captivity as only three out of the family, losing a brother and a father in this ongoing war and so many from the Nir Oz community where I grew up, many of whom feel like family. 'When we returned, I was surprised by the reception in Israel,' she admits. 'The level of attention, the extended family’s detailed attention. But even now, I still can’t fathom the failure that took place that Saturday along the border fence,' she adds. 'The massive blow to Kibbutz Nir Oz, which continues with a third of the hostages still being members of the kibbutz. I’m also stunned by how the war is being handled, by the misplaced priorities that leave the hostages in there still.' Keren explains: 'Given the cease-fire in the north and the holdup in ending the fighting in the south, it seems the army remains in Gaza to pave the way for future Jewish settlement there, rather than to search for and rescue our sons and daughters from the nightmare of the tunnels. It’s a cruel act tearing our nation apart.' When it comes to dreams for the future, Keren and Ohad imagine a different reality—one where the hostages return home and their community finally begins to truly heal. 'We’re still at war, worrying about the soldiers fighting bravely and the hostages whose return we demand.' 'I want to live a safe life in this country. Lawmakers must act with the well-being of all its citizens in mind—and above all, those children, civilians and soldiers who were violently and cruelly abducted to Gaza. 'They’re in there without protection, stripped of their rights and their lives have been in real danger for nearly 14 months. This must end before we lose them all inside the rubble. I want to close my eyes and wake up to the news that everyone is coming back. Only then can we turn to commemorating our loved ones,' Keren explains. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Kibbutz Nir Oz will rise again with substantial state assistance after the state failed to protect us, so my mother and others can return to live there safely,' she says. 'There’s so much to rebuild in the south and north and even more in people’s hearts. We deserve leadership that gives our children hope.' Ohad concludes: 'I want there to be a cease-fire, for all the hostages to come back safely, for all the soldiers to return safely and for Israel to be a country of peace.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkrmamiqjx	2024-11-28T10:32:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/27/SkWgkNcAN7Jg/SkWgkNcAN7Jg_0_49_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Housing minister at Gaza border: Settlements are the answer to Oc...	Yitzhak Goldknopf criticizes court for targeting Israeli leaders while failing to prioritize release of 101 hostages held by Hamas; FM Sa’ar says Israel has no plans to govern civilian life in Gaza Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf, during a visit to the Gaza border on Thursday, called for Jewish settlement in the coastal enclave as a response to the October 7 massacre and the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant. He criticized the ICC for pursuing alleged war crime charges against Israeli leaders instead of focusing on the release of 101 hostages still held by Hamas. Goldknopf was photographed near the Netzarim Corridor access road alongside right-wing activist Daniella Weiss and the Nachala movement, which promotes settlement initiatives, including a plan labeled the 'Map of the Garinei Hityashvut in Gaza,' using a Hebrew term referring to small groups or communities committed to establishing and developing new Jewish settlements. Goldknopf is not the only minister showing interest in Gaza settlements. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich advocated for the 'voluntary emigration' of Gaza residents and the complete military reoccupation of the territory. Speaking at a conference of the Yesha Council, a settler lobby, Smotrich claimed Israel could assume civil responsibility for Gaza, dismissing concerns over costs. 'Even if it costs five billion shekels, I’d spread it over 50 years—this is what’s needed to secure Israel’s safety,' he said, adding that military boots on the ground would be essential to combat terrorism and maintain security. Smotrich also cited opportunities created by the incoming Trump administration to facilitate emigration. 'If we talk about it less, we can achieve more. In two years, Gaza could have less than half its current population, creating an entirely different reality,' he said, describing voluntary emigration as a 'game-changer' for Israeli control over Gaza and the West Bank. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said on Thursday he believed that Israel would finish the 14-month-old war in Gaza when it 'achieves its objectives' of returning the hostages and ensuring Hamas no longer controls the Palestinian enclave. Sa'ar said Israel did not intend to control civilian life in Gaza, adding that peace was 'inevitable', but couldn't be based on 'illusions.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He also said that he believed that the United States would punish the ICC for having issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. Israel has said it will appeal the ICC decision to move against Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza war. But during a visit to the Czech Republic, Sa'ar said other countries were also dismayed by the decision, including the United States. 'I tend to believe that in Washington, legislation is going to take place very shortly against the ICC and whoever cooperates with it,' Sa'ar told a joint press conference with Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkhbsn8xyl	2024-11-28T09:49:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/28/Hy00wpRBmyx/Hy00wpRBmyx_0_128_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Military says Hezbollah injuries in war at least twice its fatalities; with no demilitarized zone, destroyed southern Lebanon homes expected to be rebuilt; fears grow over Hezbollah resuming border provocations, which cease-fire may not prevent A day and a half after the northern cease-fire took effect, the IDF is reviewing the outcome of the war with Hezbollah, emphasizing the terrorist group’s diminished strength compared to its peak before October 8, 2023. According to the military, 3,500 Hezbollah operatives were killed during the hostilities, with at least double that number injured or incapacitated. The IDF has pledged aggressive enforcement of the truce, bolstering border barriers and enhancing surveillance and monitoring capabilities. The Lebanese army has begun deploying southward to areas vacated by Israeli forces, with this deployment set to be larger and more robust than prior to the war, under American oversight. 'Rules of engagement have changed, and while challenges remain, our mission to push Hezbollah northward and keep them there is clear,' IDF officials said. Despite residents near the border demanding that Hezbollah’s fortified forward villages not be rebuilt, the IDF acknowledges these buildings are likely to return. The military’s focus will be on ensuring the absence of weapons in these areas and preventing the re-establishment of underground storage facilities and arms caches. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The cease-fire agreement does not establish a demilitarized zone, leaving the IDF responsible for enforcing security and monitoring the border to prevent arms smuggling back into Lebanon. The military is also preparing for potential provocations, such as Hezbollah-organized motorcycle parades or displays of flags, which could challenge the fragile truce. The IDF’s primary objective is to preserve its achievements and enforce the cease-fire. Troops remaining in southern Lebanon are working to block the movement of Hezbollah operatives and civilians into border villages. Efforts are underway to rebuild defensive infrastructure and establish a fortified military presence to prevent future attacks. While the northern region has seen its first 24 hours of calm since the war began, the IDF warns that enforcement actions, like a strike on a rocket-launching cell in southern Lebanon on Thursday, may provoke Hezbollah retaliation. Despite the damage inflicted on Hezbollah’s capabilities, the organization is expected to rebuild in the coming years, necessitating the reinforcement of Israel’s defensive posture and the construction of military outposts along the border. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1rsmx8x1x	2024-11-28T08:24:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/26/Syf00WQL7Qkl/Syf00WQL7Qkl_0_165_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF to launch new Haredi brigade during Hanukkah	Military recruiting 30 troops for Hashmonaim Brigade, with more primed to join later on, focusing on halachic lifestyle; brigade aims to build trust with Haredi community, offering combat roles with strict religious accommodations The IDF announced on Thursday the launch of its new Haredi combat brigade, 'Hashmonaim,' named after the Hasmonean dynasty who led the Maccabean Revolt over 2,000 years ago, with recruitment symbolically timed to coincide with Hanukkah. Initial enlistment will include 30 conscripts who have completed pre-draft assessments, with dozens more expressing interest. The brigade aims to establish one combat company of 60-80 soldiers and a reserve unit of Haredi recruits undergoing extended combat training. Unlike previous initiatives, recruitment is focused on voluntary enlistment through dialogue with yeshiva leaders and Haredi community rabbis rather than through the 7,000 draft orders recently authorized. The IDF hopes to build trust by demonstrating sensitivity to Haredi needs, including adherence to a strict religious lifestyle and halachic practices. Recruits must commit to the brigade’s regulations, including maintaining a Haredi lifestyle, modest speech and using filtered cell phones. They will be required to wear traditional Shabbat attire, such as suits and hats, during prayers and meals. Any violation of the rules will result in dismissal to standard service without special accommodations. Training and courses will be conducted entirely within the brigade to prevent integration with non-Haredi units, addressing previous concerns about breaches of religious standards in existing frameworks.

FM Sa'ar: Israel does not intend to control civilian life in Gaza	Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said on Thursday he believed the United States would punish the International Criminal Court for having issued arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister. Israel has said it will appeal the ICC decision to move against Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza war. But during a visit to the Czech Republic, Sa'ar said other countries were also dismayed by the decision, including the United States. 'I tend to believe that in Washington, legislation is going to take place very shortly against the ICC and whoever cooperates with it,' Sa'ar told a joint press conference with Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky. Sa'ar added that Israel would finish the 14-month-old war in Gaza when it 'achieves its objectives' of returning hostages being held by Hamas and ensuring the Islamist group no longer controls the Palestinian enclave. Sa'ar said Israel did not intend to control civilian life in Gaza, adding that peace was 'inevitable', but couldn't be based on 'illusions.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjnksliqjg	2024-11-28T04:51:43-08:00

For the first time since assuming office, Defense Minister Israel Katz held a conversation with British Defense Secretary John Healey. Katz emphasized to Healey that 'the most important issue for Israel right now is the return of the hostages' and stressed that he 'expects Britain to oppose any proposal for a ceasefire that is not conditioned on the release of the hostages.' In addition, Katz's office stated that the minister warned, 'Iran continues to establish terror fronts against Israel, including in Judea and Samaria.' He also added that 'Israel responds strongly to any violation of the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sydnhe8x1l	2024-11-28T04:51:36-08:00

Gidi Harari: 'The Galilee was set back 30 years' It could take more than a year to return most northern Israeli residents to their homes, according to Gidi Harari, an IDF reserves lieutenant colonel who lives in the North. He emphasized that the highest priority for the State of Israel should be to bring the residents back. 'Not everyone will come in the next [few] weeks,' he told ILTV News. 'It will take a year, even more, to bring them back.' Harari explained that residents need more than just security; they need to rebuild their lives from scratch. 'The Galilee was set back 30 years,' he told ILTV. 'People lost their work. Investors went away. The children are not studying in their schools. People are not living at their homes. 'So, everything should be built up again,' he continued. 'This is the main target now that we need to deal with.'

Man on the street: What do people from Tel Aviv think of the ceas...	All of us, as human beings in this world, are supposed to be against war' After nearly 14 months of relentless fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which displaced over 60,000 residents of Northern Israel, a ceasefire has finally come into effect. While the truce offers a sigh of relief and a glimmer of hope, it also raises pressing questions: Will the ceasefire hold? And is it the right decision for Israel’s security and future? More than 16,000 rockets launched during the conflict destroyed homes and forced thousands into displacement. Now, residents wait to see if the uneasy calm will last or if they’ll once again find themselves seeking refuge in Tel Aviv’s safe rooms. During the conflict, even the occasional northern rocket strikes added to the anxiety in the center of the country. For now, there's a collective breath of relief—but also lingering uncertainty. 'For me, as an Israeli, I have to say that people dying—it doesn’t matter if you’re an Israeli or a Lebanese citizen. All of us, as human beings in this world, are supposed to be against war,' said one resident of Tel Aviv. Israel’s airstrikes displaced nearly a million people in Lebanon, while Hezbollah continued firing into Israel until the ceasefire took effect. Opinions are divided over the ceasefire: some believe additional military pressure could have further degraded Hezbollah’s capabilities, while others argue diplomacy must now take center stage. 'I think it was a good idea. The northern communities have to go home, and this allows them to get home,' said another Tel Aviv resident. 'It’s been a really tough time, both economically and socially, having them away from the north. So I think it’s really important to find an agreement to get them home, even if it doesn’t allow Israel to achieve the last 10 or 20% of the war.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skcvbcrmke	2024-11-28T02:22:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/28/rkU7GRS7kx/rkU7GRS7kx_0_0_713_402_0_small.jpg

130 dead in surprise attack against the Syrian army, Russian plan...	The rebel organizations in northern Syria launched a 'deterring aggression' operation in Aleppo and Idlib provinces and captured settlements; Fierce fighting is going on between the parties, and the number of people killed in the fighting is the highest in the region in recent years; Russian planes bombed rebel strongholds The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Thursday that the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied rebel factions launched a surprise attack on the Syrian army in the northern province of Aleppo on Wednesday. According to the observatory, 'the death toll in the last 24 hours stands at 132, including 65 fighters of Hayat Tahrir Am-Sham, 18 of its allies and 49 soldiers in the Syrian army.' The Syrian military said that its forces were responding to the attack launched by the rebels. The Reuters news agency reported that the Syrian Air Force, along with the Russian forces assisting Damascus in the civil war, bombed areas held by the rebels near the border with Turkey. The battles in the province of Aleppo are taking place near the province of Idlib. According to the monitoring center, which provides regular reports on the war, this is the highest number of casualties in battles in the region in recent years. The monitoring center reported that in the extensive attack, called 'deterring aggression,' the rebels took control of 21 villages and sites in the western countryside of Aleppo. In a short time, after clashes with regime forces, the rebels reached a distance of 10 kilometers from the city of Aleppo. A military statement carried by state news agency SANA said that 'armed terrorist organizations grouped under so-called 'Nusra terrorist front' present in Aleppo and Idlib provinces launched a large, broad-fronted attack' on Wednesday morning. It said the attack with 'medium and heavy weapons targeted safe villages and towns and our military sites in those areas'. The army 'in cooperation with friendly forces' confronted the attack 'which is still continuing', inflicting 'heavy losses' on the armed groups, the military statement said, without reporting army losses. The Observatory said that 'Russian warplanes intensified air strikes', targeting the vicinity of Sarmin and other areas in Idlib province, alongside 'heavy artillery shelling' and rocket fire. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which used to be the Islamist al-Qaida's affiliate in Syria, controls parts of the Idlib province and small areas of the neighboring provinces of Aleppo, Hama and Takiya.

Biden pushes Gaza hostage deal while Trump prepares to lay out Mi...	Biden secures Lebanon cease-fire with global support, seeks Gaza breakthrough before Trump’s inauguration; Egypt pressures Hamas while urging Israel to show flexibility, and Hamas signals readiness for a deal, but conditions remain firm as diplomatic efforts intensify across the region As his time in the White House draws to a close, U.S. President Joe Biden has repeatedly emphasized his intention to focus on resolving key issues in the Middle East. This week, he marked a significant achievement with the announcement of a cease-fire in Lebanon after nearly 14 months of fighting on the northern front. However, Biden is far from content and is now pursuing a new hostage deal with Hamas, nearly a year after the last one. In this effort, the Biden administration is engaging with an unexpected – though perhaps not entirely surprising – partner: his predecessor and president-elect, Donald Trump. Although U.S. officials have expressed skepticism about the chances of reaching a Gaza agreement before January 20, citing what they describe as Hamas’ 'lack of willingness,' The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Cairo is pressuring Trump’s incoming administration to push Israel toward greater flexibility on certain sticking points that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been adamant about. At the same time, Egypt has delivered a blunt message to Hamas: 'You are isolated, especially following the cease-fire in the north.' Egyptian officials further informed the group that their demands for a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza are unlikely to gain Netanyahu’s approval. Meanwhile, Axios reported that Biden conveyed a clear message to Netanyahu in their most recent conversation, emphasizing the opportunity created by the northern cease-fire. According to the report, two senior American officials disclosed that the conversation occurred shortly after the Israeli cabinet approved the Lebanon cease-fire agreement. 'We have an opportunity now – let’s get the hostages out,' Biden reportedly told Netanyahu, who responded positively, indicating his willingness to try. Should Biden succeed in brokering an agreement between Israel and Hamas in the next two months, Trump may attempt to claim credit for the achievement. Earlier this week, Trump’s incoming National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz, credited the cease-fire in Lebanon to Trump’s influence, tweeting: 'Everyone is coming to the table because of President Trump.' Netanyahu confidant and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer reportedly briefed Trump earlier this month at his Florida estate on the Lebanon negotiations. According to Israeli officials who spoke with The Wall Street Journal, Trump approved the plan and expressed hope that the agreement would be finalized before his inauguration on January 20. Trump and Netanyahu, as far as is publicly known, have spoken at least three times since Trump’s election victory. Biden’s National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, stated on Wednesday that the incoming administration is being kept 'informed at every step' regarding developments in the Middle East. A senior Biden administration official noted that Trump’s advisors agreed the Lebanon cease-fire was beneficial for all parties involved – Israel, Lebanon, and the United States. 'The priority was to act now, rather than later – something Trump’s team also recognized. This agreement will save many lives on both sides,' the official stated. Trump’s stance on Gaza has been inconsistent in the past. In July, he called on Netanyahu to 'end it quickly,' referring to the conflict. However, in October, Trump expressed support for Israel’s campaign against Hamas and Hezbollah, telling Netanyahu in one of their conversations: 'Do what you need to do.' According to The Wall Street Journal, since winning the election, Trump appears to see a strategic advantage in resolving the Gaza crisis before his inauguration, just as Biden does. 'A flurry of diplomatic activity is already underway,' Egyptian and Arab mediators told the American newspaper. Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani is currently in Cairo, pushing for an agreement, amid reports that an Egyptian delegation has either recently arrived in Israel or plans to do so soon. Egyptian officials, after extended contact with Trump’s team, are reportedly pressuring him to take an active role in resolving the Gaza crisis, believing that his involvement could encourage Netanyahu to move forward with an agreement. 'Over the coming days, the United States will make another push with Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza with the hostages released and an end to the war without Hamas in power,' Biden tweeted on Wednesday. He reiterated similar sentiments in his remarks following the northern cease-fire. Hamas: 'Ready for a cease-fire agreement' On Wednesday morning, as Lebanese residents were seen returning to their destroyed villages and raising Hezbollah flags, Hamas welcomed the agreement between Israel and Lebanon. A senior member of Hamas’ political bureau told AFP that the group was 'ready for a cease-fire agreement' as well, which would include a hostage deal. 'The announcement of the ceasefire in Lebanon is a major achievement for the resistance. It’s a victory,' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The senior Hamas official also stated the group had informed mediators in Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey of its readiness to negotiate a ceasefire and a 'serious hostage deal.' Predictably, he accused Israel of disrupting previous progress. Hamas also reiterated its commitment to cooperating with efforts toward a ceasefire in Gaza but maintained its conditions. 'We are determined to stop the war against our people under the conditions we agreed upon: a ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces, the return of the displaced, and the completion of a hostage deal,' the group announced. Qatar’s Prime Minister Al Thani also commented on the northern agreement on Wednesday, saying, 'Consultations with Egypt regarding a Gaza ceasefire are ongoing. We hope the agreement in Lebanon will lead to a ceasefire in Gaza. We have also agreed with Egypt on joint humanitarian aid projects.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkf6kqrxkl	2024-11-27T22:45:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/06/06/B1gwA7LyHC/B1gwA7LyHC_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
Antisemitic influencer Candace Owens banned from entering New Zea...	Denial of visa comes weeks after Australia also rejected her visa request, citing remarks in which she denied Nazi medical experimentation on Jews in concentration camps during World War II The U.S. conservative political commentator Candace Owens was refused a visa to enter New Zealand for a speaking engagement because she had been banned from another country, immigration officials said Thursday. News of the ruling came weeks after neighboring Australia also rejected her visa request, citing remarks in which she denied Nazi medical experimentation on Jews in concentration camps during World War II. Owens is scheduled to speak at a series of events in several Australian cities and in Auckland, New Zealand, in February and March 2025. Tickets remain on sale and there is no acknowledgement on the promoter’s website that she has been refused entry to both countries. The commentator, who has more than 3 million followers on YouTube, is accused by her detractors of promoting conspiracy theories and antisemitism and has ignited firestorms with her remarks opposing Black Lives Matter, feminism, vaccines and immigration. In March, Owens said she had parted ways with the Daily Wire, on which she had hosted an online talk show since 2021, after clashes with its founders over her remarks about Jews and her opposition to U.S. military support for Israel. She was widely criticized for comments in a YouTube video in July that minimized the Holocaust. Owens had promised Australian and New Zealand audiences a discussion of free speech and her Christian faith when she announced the speaking tour in August. But Australian officials banned her from the country in October, with Immigration Minister Tony Burke telling reporters Owens 'has the capacity to incite discord in almost every direction,' citing her remarks about the Holocaust and about Muslims. 'Australia’s national interest is best served when Candace Owens is somewhere else,' Burke said. Australian Jewish groups had urged officials to bar her from the country. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: New Zealand officials did not refer to Owens’ political views in a statement on Thursday. She was refused an entertainer’s work permit for New Zealand on the grounds that visas legally cannot be granted to those who have been excluded from another country, said Jock Gilray, a spokesperson for the immigration agency. The Australia-based promoter, Rocksman, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1purch71e	2024-11-27T22:11:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/28/Byr8P9rXJg/Byr8P9rXJg_0_0_802_442_0_small.jpg
