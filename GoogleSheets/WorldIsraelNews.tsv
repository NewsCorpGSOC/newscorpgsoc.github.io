This airline just suspended flights to Israel until March 2025	Skyrocketing insurance premiums are preventing carriers from resuming passenger and cargo flights to Israel. By World Israel News Staff British Airways announced on Monday that it is suspending all flights to Israel through March 2025, joining a long list of carriers who are no longer flying to the Jewish State. The cancellation 'will give greater certainty to our customers who we’re contacting to advise them of their options, including a full refund,' a British Airways spokesperson told the Times of Israel in an emailed statement. The American carriers Delta and United have also said that they expect to resume flights to Israel only in March 2025. Because American Airlines also suspended flights to Israel, national carrier El AL is the only airline providing direct flights between Israel and the U.S. at the moment. In late September, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) advised European airline to avoid flying to Israel following the assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. While that recommendation was lifted several weeks ago, European carriers have been hesitant to restore their previous Israel routes. KLM, the Lufthansa group and its subsidiaries, Vueling, Air Canada, Ryanair, Cathay Pacific, easyJet, Wizz Air, Air India, LOT, and Emirates are just some of the airlines that are no longer flying to the Jewish State. Only a handful of European airlines, including TUS and Bluebird Airways, are currently facilitating cargo and passenger flights to Israel. Skyrocketing insurance premiums are preventing carriers from resuming passenger and cargo flights to Israel. The lack of flights has seriously impacted the Jewish State's manufacturing industry, with imports and exports seriously delayed. Several industry leaders spoke out against the government, saying the Transport and Finance Ministries must provide financial assistance to businesses impacted by the flight shortage, along with subsidies to encourage airlines to return to Israel. 'Insurers do not agree, or impose premiums that are too high, for the planes to touch Israeli soil,' said Or Berlowitz, the CEO of Israeli airline Arkia, during a recent Knesset hearing on the issue. 'The State of Israel provides a subsidy only for Israeli planes and not for leased planes. In fact, it gives a premium for protection insurance during wartime, and if there was no such thing, no plane would take off from here.'

Hamas murdering Gazans fleeing combat zone: IDF paramedic	IDF paramedic describes Hamas opening fire on civilians in the Strip, wounding unarmed Gazans. By World Israel News Staff Hamas gunmen are shooting unarmed Gazan civilians attempting to flee Jabaliya in the northern Gaza Strip, as the IDF engages in intensive anti-terror offensive in the area. The IDF has announced that Jabaliya is now a combat zone and that unarmed people should leave the city, but Hamas is actively preventing civilians from fleeing. 'Our battalion went into action to exert as much military pressure as possible on Hamas terrorists, who held the civilian population in the area and forbade them from evacuating to a safe area,' IDF paramedic Corporal Shai Gilboa, told Channel 12 News. According to Gilboa, Hamas opened fire on Gazan civilians trying to reach safety, in an attempt to keep them in the line of fire between the terror group and Israeli military operating in the area. Gazans hurt by Hamas gunfire sought help from the IDF, Gilboa said. 'The wounded came to us and we provided them with first aid in the field, which mostly entailed stopping the bleeding,' she said. She challenged the narrative that Gazans unaffiliated with Hamas are intimidated by IDF troops. 'They smile at us, they wave goodbye to us,' she said. 'They curse Hamas in front of us.' 'Not only are they not afraid of us, a lot of them are on our side,' she added. Hamas has long used Gazan civilians as human shields as central part of its strategy, intentionally holding battles in crowded urban areas in order to maximize civilian casualties. The terror group then leverages the deaths of those caught in the crossfire to falsely accuse Israel of committing human rights violations. Gilboa's account comes after the Biden administration increased pressure on Israel to admit more aid into the Strip. Shortly afterwards, Washington admitted that armed gangs in Gaza - presumably affiliated with Hamas - are preventing the transfer of humanitarian goods throughout the coastal enclave.

Pennsylvania Senate race moves to ‘toss up’ as Dem Bob Casey lose...	Pennsylvania is a key battleground state that could determine both the presidential election and which party controls the Upper Chamber. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon Pennsylvania’s Senate race has shifted from 'lean Democrat' to a 'toss up' as incumbent Sen. Bob Casey (D.) loses ground to his Republican challenger Dave McCormick just two weeks before Election Day, according to the Cook Political Report. Cook stated that the race is now competitive enough to be considered a 'toss up,' adding that 'both Republican and Democratic internal polls show this is now a margin-of-error race, with Casey holding a slim, statistically insignificant lead of between one and two points.' As his reelection prospects slip, Casey is aiming to appeal to Donald Trump voters, highlighting in an ad released last week his 'siding with' the former president on a trade and tariffs bill in 2017. Polling released Monday by Atlas Intel shows McCormick with a slight lead over Casey for the first time in the Senate race. Around 48.3 percent of respondents said they would vote for McCormick, while 47.1 percent supported Casey. In September, Casey led McCormick 47 percent to 45 percent, according to Atlas Intel. Pennsylvania is a key battleground state that could determine both the presidential election and which party controls the Upper Chamber. Presidential nominees Trump and Kamala Harris remain effectively tied in the Keystone State, the New York Times reported Monday. Republicans are looking to regain control of the Senate, where Democrats hold a narrow 51-49 majority. The seat vacated by retiring West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin (I.) is widely expected to flip red, while Montana GOP candidate Tim Sheehy is polling ahead of incumbent Sen. Jon Tester (D.).

Suicide a ‘delayed trauma response,’ experts warn after Oct. 7 su...	An increase in suicide can be a delayed response to the powerful national trauma that the war brings,' said Dr. Shiri Daniels. By Anna Epshtein, TPS Although the first months after the October 7 attacks saw fewer suicide-related calls to Israel’s national emergency line, the number of suicide cases may increase as the war continues, Israeli researchers warned on Monday. The announcement came one day after October 7 survivor Shirel Golan killed herself on her 22nd birthday. Golan was at the Nova Music Festival, an all-night rave attended by 3,500 people at Kibbutz Re’im. The festival became a killing field where 364 people were massacred and 40 others were taken hostage. Of all the locations attacked by Hamas on October 7, the highest death toll was at the music festival. 'An increase in suicide can be a delayed response to the powerful national trauma that the war brings,' said Dr. Shiri Daniels, the National Professional Director of the Israeli ERAN Association for emotional first aid. Daniels was part of a team of researchers from the University of Haifa, Tel Aviv University, Columbia University, and the Israeli College of Management who analyzed all the calls to ERAN’s hotline in the three months after the October 7 attack. Their findings were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, JAMA Psychiatry. ‘We Expect An increase In Suicide Risk Rates’ The researchers found there was a decline of suicide-related calls following the attack as compared to months before the attack – from 1,887 calls in the three months before the war to 1,663 calls total in the three months after, in contrast to sharp increase in the overall number of calls. But then the numbers of suicide-related calls began to grow, too. 'One possible reason for the decrease in suicide-related calls in the immediate period after October 7th is the increased social cohesion that sometimes occurs in the initial stage of a national crisis,' said Dr. Joy Benatov from the Special Education Department at the University of Haifa, who led the research. 'But the effect of this cohesion dissipates with the prolongation of crises,’ Dr. Benatov adds. ‘In light of the continuation of the war and national crisis, we expect an increase in suicide risk rates, as we saw in studies conducted after the September 11 terrorist attack in New York,' she added. ‘She Looked Unfocused’ Golan was rescued from the Nova massacre by a police officer from the Bedouin village of Rahat Remo Salman el-Hozayel, one of the heroes of a documentary film, 'In the Same Boat,' which tells stories of Israeli-Arab citizens who saved lives on October 7. 'She looked unfocused, was jumping from theme to theme,' Roman Kovgan, line producer of the documentary who interviewed Golan in March, recalled to The Press Service of Israel. 'It was evident she was not in a good psychological state.' Kovgan also recalled meeting Golan again one day before the documentary’s October 7 premiere in Tel Aviv. 'She looked even more depressed and said it would be too hard for her to see the movie, she was gathering all her strength to get through the anniversary,' Kovgan said. Golan’s family said Shirel developed Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder but never received adequate state assistance for the necessary treatment. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

‘I only did it for the money’ – Iranian spy in Israel	Israeli man who admitted to spying for Iran claims he was motivated only by money, not ideology. By World Israel News Staff An Azeri-Israeli man who spied on behalf of Iran during the ongoing war told investigators that he was motivated solely by the financial rewards he received, and said he is not hostile towards the State of Israel. According to a report from Hebrew language outlet Mako, one of the key players in the newly uncovered 7 member Iranian spy ring claimed he was 'blind' to the national security ramifications of his actions. Aziz Nisanov, who immigrated to Israel from Azerbaijan, admitted that he had carried out numerous activities on behalf of Iran, such as taking pictures of sensitive military bases and other sites that could be potentially targeted by Tehran. 'I know that I made a stupid mistake and that I will pay for it by sitting in prison,' Nisanov told investigators, according to the Mako report. 'I did not realize that I was harming the security of the state. I was blind and did what was asked of me. I was only interested in the money, I did not think about anything else.' News of the arrest of another Azeri immigrant charged with spying for Iran, Haifa resident Vyacheslav Guschin, surprised his acquaintances. A friend of Guschin, who was only identified by his first initial G, described him as an unemployed alcoholic who would engage in street brawls with others in the neighborhood. Gushin worked sporadically in odd jobs, such as washing cars or delivering food, G told Mako. 'He used to spend most of the money he earned on alcohol and cigarettes,' G said. 'He lived alone. He often got into fights with people when he was drunk. I thought he could be many things, but a spy? I wouldn't have dreamed of it.' According to G, Guschin abruptly disappeared from public life around six weeks ago. Patrons of a local liquor store Guschin frequented had noticed he was not seen for a while. 'We thought that he went abroad to visit his family or that he moved to another neighborhood,' G said. 'Everyone is here in complete shock that he was revealed to be a spy.'

Though designated a terror group, Hamas funding thrives in Europe	One way the groups stay ahead of authorities is by shifting operations to newer organizations. By David Isaac, JNS The Hamas terror organization has managed to increase its fundraising efforts in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom since its terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, according to four reports that the European Leadership Network released this month. The reports from ELNET, which convenes leaders to foster close relations between Europe and Israel, focus on the activities of Hamas-affiliated fundraising groups in the five countries. 'In all four reports, we have seen increasing levels of operations since Oct. 7,' Daniel Shadmy, an ELNET spokesman, told JNS. The reports identify some 30 organizations, which operate under 'civil fronts,' including nonprofits and lobbying groups, and people affiliated with Hamas who work in Europe. Hamas’s funding operations are more deeply rooted in the United Kingdom and Germany than in the other countries upon which the report focuses. That makes them 'harder to dismantle' in the two countries, according to Shadmy. Hamas-affiliated groups operate relatively unscathed in Europe, despite European governments and the European Union designating Hamas a terror organization. One way the groups stay ahead of authorities is by shifting operations to newer organizations, per the ELNET reports. 'One of the key findings of the report is that the Hamas-affiliated network has shut down three older, pan-European organizations, possibly in response to formal designations, and moved their operations to three newer organizations,' Shadmy told JNS. 'The ‘replacement organizations’ were established and are led in whole or in part by the same six individuals who led the initially dissolved groups,' per the reports, which name the six as Adel Abdallah Doghman, Mohammad Hannoun, Majed Al-Zeer, Amin Abou Rashed, Zaher Birawi and Mazen Kahel. The organizations that make up the 'new' circle include the Palestinians in Europe Conference, the European Palestinian Council for Political Relations and the European Palestinians Initiative for National Action. There is the European failure to enforce penalties on those associated with the terror group, per the reports. 'There is a gap between the sanctions or designations in place and the willingness or operational capability of European governments or the E.U. institutions to enforce them, which leads to this situation,' Shadmy told JNS. Many of the organizations that ELNET identified are not officially registered, 'raising concerns about their transparency, activities and true objectives in Europe,' per the reports. Some of those activities include lobbying E.U. officials, delivering material support to the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, influencing the public via media relations and 'legitimizing Hamas-affiliated actors to European policymakers without disclosing their Hamas ties,' the reports state. ELNET calls on European governments to investigate and shut down the Hamas-affiliated organizations and asks banks and financial institutions to monitor the Hamas-affiliated individuals mentioned in the reports and review their financial activity. ELNET also hopes that its reports will be a resource for research institutions and think tanks to expose publicly Hamas’s European fundraising.

IDF discovers Nasrallah’s half a billion dollar money bunker bene...	The IDF also reported it carried out airstrikes against Hezbollah's banks and financial institutions. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari announced that Israel's military has uncovered a money bunker worth half a billion dollars belonging to Hezbollah's deceased leader Hassan Nasrallah underneath a hospital in Lebanon. The store of money was discovered underneath the Al-Sahel Hospital in Dahieh, Beirut, and was used as Nasrallah's hiding place during emergencies. Hagari said that Israel's military will not strike the hospital. However, hospital director Fadi Alameh has denied the facility has any connection to Hezbollah and has urged the Lebanese army to guard the site. According to a N12 report, the money is used by Hezbollah to fund its activities and much of it has been diverted from funds intended for the Lebanese public. 'This bunker is deliberately placed under the hospital and on both sides of it,' Hagari said. 'You can see the buildings under which the entrance shafts to the bunker are located.' 'This money could and still can go to rebuilding the state of Lebanon. This money had been intended to go exclusively to arming the terrorist organization Hezbollah and had no other destination,' he added. Hagari said the IAF will continue to monitor the compound. He continued, 'We call on the citizens of Lebanon, the Lebanese government, and international institutions - do not allow Hezbollah to keep terrorist funds under a hospital. Even in the coming hours, we will continue to attack Hezbollah targets throughout Lebanon, including in Beirut in Dahieh.' The IDF also reported it carried out airstrikes against Hezbollah's banks and financial institutions used to launder money and fund terror attacks. The Al-Qard al-Hassan Association (AQAH), often referred to as Hezbollah's 'bank,' is technically a charitable association. Israel apparently struck 20 of AQAH's 34 branches in crucial Hezbollah strongholds, including Beirut, Tyre, Sidon, and Baalbek, on Sunday night. In comments to The Press Service of Israel, one senior figure in the Israeli intelligence community described AQAH as 'one of the largest centers of economic power for the Iranian proxy.'

Sinwar used 6 hostages as human shields before they were murdered	When the IDF recovered the bodies of the six hostages, they also discovered DNA evidence that Sinwar had been in the area. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News According to reports and DNA evidence, the six hostages who were executed in late August were used as human shields by Hamas leader and October 7th mastermind Yahya Sinwar, who was killed last week. Sinwar was eliminated by chance during an IDF operation in Rafah, not far away from where the six hostages were killed by their captors. The names of the six slain hostages are Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Alex Lobanov, Carmel Gat, and Almog Sarusi. When the IDF recovered the bodies of the hostages on August 31, they also discovered DNA from Sinwar indicating he had been in the area at some point between August 21 and August 27. Reports from early in the war that Sinwar was hiding in Gaza tunnels and using hostages as human shields, and the DNA, location, and reports connect the six slain hostages to Sinwar. The IDF had opportunities to assassinate Sinwar earlier in the war, but his use of hostages as human shields proved an obstacle to these operations. The reason Sinwar was discovered last week unaccompanied by hostages was due to the fact that the six had been killed, and their severely weakened conditions were likely a factor in their not being forced to travel with him. The hostages subsisted for months on only energy bars until they were too weak to move alongside Sinwar and were executed. The terrorist captors moved many of the hostages to Rafah following the liberation of 105 of them in November because the IDF had not yet operated in the area close to the Egyptian border. The six hostages were confined to a tunnel three stories or 20 meters below ground, with their captors living above. On August 21, the IDF, acting on intelligence Sinwar was in the area, battled with 26 terrorists, killing and wounding most of them, among them those who had been guarding the hostages. When the dead captors were replaced, the new captors suspected the IDF was attacking them again and decided to execute the six hostages.

Hezbollah only has 30% of it firepower left, IDF reports	2,000 Hezbollah terrorists have been eliminated since the war began, 1,200 of them since the initial ground operation in Lebanon. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel's Northern Command reports that Hezbollah only has 30% of its rockets and launchers remaining and has lost 2,000 of its terrorists since October 8th last year. The Northern Command added that just a few more weeks of operations in Lebanon are required to accomplish goals that will allow northern Israeli residents to return home in safety. According to IDF data, 2,000 Hezbollah terrorists have been eliminated since the war began, 1,200 of them since the initial ground operation in Lebanon. Of the terrorists the IDF eliminated, seven were Hezbollah brigade commanders, 21 were battalion commanders, and 24 were company commanders. The IDF attacked 3,200 Hezbollah targets, which include weapons depots, launchers, anti-tank positions, and command centers, 300 of them in the last 24 hours. Overnight on Sunday, the IDF targeted dozens of sites and facilities in Lebanon that Hezbollah used to fund terror attacks against Israelis. 'These funds, which Hezbollah used for terror activities, were stored by the Al-Qard al-Hassan Association, which directly funds Hezbollah's terror activities, including the purchase of weapons and payments to operatives in Hezbollah's military wing,' the IDF said. 'The Hezbollah terrorist organization stores billions of dollars in the association's branches, including money that was directly held under the name of the terrorist organization,' the statement continued. 'We will strike a large number of targets in the coming hours, and additional targets later tonight,' IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said on Sunday, emphasizing that in the coming days, the IDF would reveal how Iran funds Hezbollah's terror activities via civilian institutions, associations and organizations. Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, head of the Arab Media Branch in the IDF Spokesperson's Unit, said, 'The Iranian state budget funds a large portion of Hezbollah's terrorist activities. Hezbollah uses these funds to finance its terrorist activities, including acquiring weapons, purchasing facilities for storing combat equipment, establishing launch sites and paying its members, as well as carrying out various terrorist activities.'

Report: Hamas SIM card alert ignored hours before Oct. 7 massacre	Marked 'Top Secret,' the warning was sent to several key security bodies, including the Israel Police, the National Security Council, and the Mossad. By Jewish Breaking News A shocking new report has exposed a critical intelligence oversight in the hours leading up to Hamas’ devastating October 7 attack on southern Israel. According to Channel 12, the Shin Bet had distributed SIM cards among Hamas ranks as part of a covert operation to serve as an early warning system. At 2:58 a.m. on October 7, roughly three hours before the attack, an automated alert was triggered when a significant number of these cards were simultaneously activated across multiple Hamas battalions. Marked 'Top Secret,' the warning was sent to several key security bodies, including the Israel Police, the National Security Council, and the Mossad. However, despite its worrying nature, the alert failed to prompt any significant response. The Hamas massacre near the Gaza border proceeded as planned, where terrorists would later slaughter 1,200 innocent civilians and take 250 hostages. Police insiders claim that such a critical alert warranted direct phone calls, not just a written report. Compounding the oversight, intelligence had noted Hamas leaders retreating to underground bunkers days before. As investigations into the events leading up to October 7 continue, the IDF has promised transparency. IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari referred to the reports during a press briefing on Sunday night. 'We have not yet finished the investigations into warnings on the night of October 7,' he said. 'At the moment, we are focusing on fighting and dealing with investigations.' However, for a public demanding answers, such assurances provide little comfort.

‘UNIFIL cannot be part of the solution’ after report Hezbollah br...	In an Oct. 13 video message, Israeli Prime Minister directly called on UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to withdraw the contingent of 10,500 UNIFIL soldiers from 50 countries for their own safety. By Pesach Benson, TPS Following a report that Hezbollah bribed UNIFIL peacekeepers to use their positions in southern Lebanon and took control of their security cameras along the border, an analyst said the monitors 'cannot be part of the solution.' According to a Monday report in the Israel Hayom daily, captured Hezbollah terrorists taken to Israel for questioning told interrogators that the Iran-backed terror group paid peacekeepers to use UNIFIL positions in southern Lebanon. The report added that the terrorists also admitted that Hezbollah took control of the force’s security cameras. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, which is tasked with monitoring the cessation of hostilities between Israel and Lebanon, did not respond to The Press Service of Israel’s requests for comment. 'It’s crucial that UNIFIL does a very serious internal review of what’s really going on there,' Sarit Zahavi, president and founder of the Alma Research Center, told TPS-IL. 'UNIFIL itself cannot be part of the solution now. This time, there must be an effective enforcement mechanism that won’t allow Hezbollah to recover from the damage the IDF inflicted on them,' she added, explaining that 'we don’t find ourselves back in the same situation within a year.' Said Zahavi, 'For years, we’ve been raising the need to significantly reduce UNIFIL’s force. You don’t need ten thousand soldiers to provide humanitarian assistance. And you don’t need ten thousand soldiers getting in our way to do the job they didn’t do.' Israeli officials have called on UNIFIL to evacuate southern Lebanon. In an Oct. 13 video message, Israeli Prime Minister directly called on UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to withdraw the contingent of 10,500 soldiers from 50 countries for their own safety, saying the monitors are 'providing a human shield to Hezbollah terrorists.' Guterres and Western diplomats rejected Netanyahu’s call. The UN Security Council unanimously renewed UNIFIL’s mandate in August. UNIFIL was established in 1978 to confirm Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon. The 'Blue Line' demarcating the 120 km-long Israel-Lebanone border was created in 2000 by UN cartographers to verify Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon, which the UN Security Council later certified as complete. The border runs from Rosh HaNikra on the Mediterranean coast to Mount Dov, where it converges with Syria. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, the terror group is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. More than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. Israeli officials have been critical of the peacekeepers for failing to stop Hezbollah, which has fired thousands of rockets at Israel since October 7. 'By and large, every third house in the Shi’ite villages of south Lebanon is used in some way by Hezbollah for military purposes, be it weapons storage, the entrance of a tunnel, or a launchpad for shooting rockets at Israel,' Zahavi told TPS-IL in August.

US says THAAD anti-missile system ‘in place’ in Israel	President Joe Biden said the THAAD’s deployment, along with about 100 US soldiers, was meant to help defend Israel. By The Algemeiner and Reuters The US military has rushed its advanced anti-missile system to Israel and it is now 'in place,' Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said. THAAD, or the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, is a critical part of the US military’s layered air defense systems and adds to Israel‘s already formidable anti-missile defenses. 'The THAAD system is in place,' Austin said, speaking to reporters before his arrival in Ukraine on Monday. He declined to say whether it was operational, but added: 'We have the ability to put it into operation very quickly and we’re on pace with our expectations.' President Joe Biden said the THAAD’s deployment, along with about 100 US soldiers, was meant to help defend Israel, which is weighing an expected retaliation against Iran after Tehran fired more than 180 missiles at Israel on Oct 1. The United States has been urging Israel to calibrate its response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to an Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear sites and his concerns about a strike on its energy infrastructure. Responding to questions from reporters, Biden said last week he had a good understanding of when and how Israel would attack Iran. But he also said he saw an opportunity to end the two enemies’ back-and-forth strikes. Austin was cautious. 'It’s hard to say exactly what that [Israel‘s] strike will look like,' Austin told reporters. 'At the end of the day, that’s an Israeli decision, and whether or not the Israelis believe it’s proportional and how the Iranians perceive it, I mean those may be two different things.' 'We’re going to do — continue to do — everything we can … to dial down the tensions and hopefully get both parties to begin to de-escalate. So, we’ll see what happens,' he added.

Israeli Japanese study offers new hope for pancreatic cancer pati...	Laboratory tests have yielded promising results, with D’20 effectively inhibiting the movement of pancreatic cancer cells while allowing normal cell growth to continue unimpeded. By Jewish Breaking News A groundbreaking study between Israeli and Japanese scientists may herald a new era in the fight against pancreatic cancer. Researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the Weizmann Institute of Science, and the University of Tokyo have been tackling Matrix Metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7), an enzyme crucial to cancer’s ability to invade surrounding tissues. Previous attempts to target MMP7 have been hampered by its structural similarities to other essential enzymes, making it challenging to develop a drug that wouldn’t disrupt vital bodily functions. Undeterred, the researchers employed an advanced peptide discovery technology called Mirror-Image Random Nonstandard Peptide Integrated Discovery (MI-RaPID) to identify D’20. Laboratory tests have yielded promising results, with D’20 effectively inhibiting the movement of pancreatic cancer cells while allowing normal cell growth to continue unimpeded. What sets D’20 apart is its unique structure. Composed of twelve specially modified D-amino acids, it demonstrates remarkable stability in conditions mimicking the human body, including exposure to blood and digestive enzymes. The team’s findings, recently published in the peer-reviewed journal Angewandte Chemie, have sparked excitement in the oncology community. While human trials are still on the horizon, the success of D’20 in laboratory settings offers hope for more effective pancreatic cancer treatments in the future.

Israel strikes at heart of Hezbollah’s terror financing system	Most of the bank’s funding comes from Iran, totaling some $700 million per year, as well as from illegal sources such as cocaine trafficking. By Joshua Marks, JNS Israeli airstrikes targeted Hezbollah financial sites across Lebanon overnight Sunday, including in Beirut. According to the Israel Defense Forces, dozens of facilities and sites used by the Iranian proxy to fund its terrorist activities against the Jewish state were attacked. 'These funds, which Hezbollah used for terror activities, were stored by the Al-Qard al-Hassan Association, which directly funds Hezbollah’s terror activities, including the purchase of weapons and payments to operatives in Hezbollah’s military wing,' the IDF said.

'We will strike a large number of targets in the coming hours, and additional targets later tonight,' IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said on Sunday, emphasizing that in the coming days, the IDF would reveal how Iran funds Hezbollah’s terror activities via civilian institutions, associations and organizations. The military emphasized that many measures were taken before the strikes to minimize harm to the civilian population, including issuing advanced warnings via various platforms. Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, head of the Arab Media Branch in the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit, posted a video message in Arabic to X urging residents of Lebanon to move away from infrastructure associated with the Al-Qard al-Hassan Association shortly before the wave of attacks began. 'A large portion of Hezbollah’s terrorist activities is funded by the Iranian state budget. Hezbollah uses these funds to finance its terrorist activities, including acquiring weapons, purchasing facilities for storing combat equipment, establishing launch sites and paying its members, as well as carrying out various terrorist activities,' Adraee explained. #عاجل سكان لبنان، جيش الدفاع سوف يبدأ مهاجمة بنى تحتية تابعة لجمعية القرض الحسن التابعة لحزب الله - ابتعدوا عنها فورًا يتم تمويل قسم كبير من انشطة منظمة حزب الله الإرهابية من ميزانية الدولة الإيرانية، حيث يستخدم حزب الله هذه الأموال بغية تمويل أنشطته الإرهابية وبضمن ذلك… pic.twitter.com/E6SkEikfHG &mdash; افيخاي ادرعي (@AvichayAdraee) October 20, 2024 He issued evacuation notices for at least 25 buildings in the Beirut area, in the Bekaa Valley and in South Lebanon.

'The IDF continues to work forcefully to destroy Hezbollah’s terrorist infrastructure. Therefore, we urge people inside buildings used by Hezbollah to move at least 500 meters away in the coming hours.' Many explosions were reported in the Dahiya neighborhood south of Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold. Israeli attacks were also carried out near the Beirut airport. Buildings were seen collapsing and others were on fire. מטוסי קרב של חיל האוויר תקפו במהלך הלילה, בביירות, בעומק ובדרום לבנון, ובהכוונה מודיעינית של אגף המודיעין, עשרות מפקדות ואתרים בהם אוחסנו כספים ששימשו את הזרוע הצבאית של ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה לפעילות טרור נגד מדינת ישראל>> pic.twitter.com/QKxITJxzkc &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) October 21, 2024 According to Lebanese media reports, there were three casualties from a drone strike on a residential building in Baalbek, and additional strikes were reported in the Beqaa Valley region. 'These strikes are part of the IDF’s ongoing efforts to degrade Hezbollah’s terror infrastructure, its military capabilities and ability to rebuild,' the IDF said. According to Channel 12, Hezbollah’s economic institution, Al-Qard, operates about 30 branches in areas of Lebanon where Shi’ite Muslims are concentrated, with about half of the branches being in Beirut. Most of the bank’s funding comes from Iran, totaling some $700 million per year, as well as from illegal sources such as cocaine trafficking, according to the report. 'The Shiite terror organization is under heavy sanctions, and Qard Al-Hassan allows it to operate without significant restrictions,' Channel 12 reported. 'According to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), the volume of loans given by Qard Al-Hassan grew from approximately $76.5 million in 2007, the year after the Second Lebanon War, to around $480 million in 2019. The total activity of Qard Al-Hassan from the opening of the network in 1983 until 2019 is estimated at about $3.5 billion,' the report continued. This growth occurred despite American sanctions imposed as early as 2007. 'The reason for this is that the employees of Qard Al-Hassan use private accounts in recognized banks in Lebanon, with the aim of circumventing the sanctions,' according to Channel 12. IDF ground operations in Southern Lebanon continue The IDF said on Monday morning that over the past 24 hours, troops in Southern Lebanon had located and dismantled large amounts of Hezbollah weaponry, including anti-tank missiles, launchers aimed at Israeli communities, RPG launchers, munitions, explosives, grenades and additional combat equipment. תמונות מפעילות כוחות צה'ל בדרום לבנון: pic.twitter.com/KUWacMcHgV &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) October 21, 2024 Soldiers also killed Hezbollah terrorists, including tactical-level commanders and a terrorist cell that had launched anti-tank missiles at soldiers.

Israel’s army provided further updates on the ground activities in Southern Lebanon on Monday afternoon, reporting that the 188th Brigade Combat Team under the command of the 36th Division killed terrorists and destroyed underground infrastructure and large amounts of weapons. In recent days, soldiers destroyed a weapons storage facility located in a residential neighborhood next to a house. The facility contained dozens of long- and short-range missiles, ammunition, mortars, machine guns, explosives and medical equipment.

In those places, instead there is now a presence of IDF troops, overwhelming the terrorists,' Gallant told soldiers serving in the IDF’s 98th Division. The minister held an operational assessment with the division commander and other senior officers, and also spoke with combat troops. 'Our goal is to completely ‘clean’ the area [of Hezbollah infrastructure] so that Israel’s northern communities may return to their homes and rebuild their lives. I believe that this is very significant—the IDF is conducting operations and we still have missions to complete,' Gallant said. 'We have Hezbollah prisoners who are sharing information. They have informed us of the great fear felt [among Hezbollah terrorists]. Hezbollah is collapsing.'

Sinwar refused Egyptian offer to flee Gaza, Israel held back on k...	Egypt reportedly offered to help Sinwar escape the Gaza Strip in exchange for letting Cairo negotiate a hostage deal with Israel – but was refused. By World Israel News Staff Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar was offered an opportunity by Egypt to escape the Gaza Strip, according to a new report, but declined the offer, insisting he remain in the coastal enclave amid the war with Israel. On Sunday night, The Wall Street Journal reported that early on in the war after October 7th, Arab negotiators working to broker a deal between Hamas and Israel proposed that Sinwar be allowed to escape, in exchange for Cairo being empowered to negotiate on behalf of Hamas with Israel to secure a hostage deal and ceasefire. Sinwar declined the offer, however, in part, according to the report, because of his hope that Hezbollah and Iran might be brought into a full-scale war with Israel. 'I’m not under siege, I’m on Palestinian soil,' Sinwar was quoted as telling Arab negotiators early in the war when he turned down their offer of allowing him to escape abroad. The Hamas leader reportedly counted on intense pressure from abroad on Israel over collateral damage during the war to induce Jerusalem to agree to the terror group’s terms in talks, effectively imposing a deal on Israel which was favorable to Hamas. The report added that Sinwar remained adamant throughout that Hamas would make no concessions in negotiations with Israel, even after he predicted that the murder of six Israeli hostages in September would provoke fierce criticism of the terror group and renewed efforts to compel Hamas to soften its position. In addition, the report claimed that prior to October 7th, Israel had mulled assassination Sinwar, citing people involved in the plans. However, the operations were inevitably nixed over disagreements among Israeli officials, a source said.

Iranian spy cell in Israel uncovered	Seven Israeli Jews arrested for allegedly spying on Israel's Iron Dome missile defense network and other key targets on behalf of Tehran. By World Israel News Staff Seven Israeli Jews from northern Israel were arrested recently on suspicion of spying on behalf of Iran, Israeli prosecutors revealed Monday. The Rishon Lezion Magistrate’s Court on Monday lifted a publication ban, revealing that Israel’s State Prosecutor has filed a statement of intent to indict seven Israeli citizens from Haifa and other towns in northern Israel. The suspects, including an IDF soldier who went AWOL and two minors, are accused of being recruited by Iranian agents and carrying out various espionage missions on their behalf. According to the investigation, the suspects allegedly gathered intelligence on sensitive military sites, including Israel air force bases at Nevatim and Ramat David, the Kirya military headquarters in Tel Aviv, and Iron Dome defense systems. Additionally, they received maps of strategic locations, such as the Golani Brigade training base. The suspects named are Aziz Nisanov, Alexander Sadikov, Yigal Nissan, Vyacheslav Gushchin, and Yevgeny Yoffe. The identities of the two minors remain classified under a gag order. The State Prosecutor plans to submit formal charges on Friday to the Haifa District Court, alleging serious security offenses. Prosecutors describe the case as one of the most severe espionage incidents investigated in recent years. The investigation has been overseen by the head of the Haifa District Security Prosecution team, Shelly Brazili-Zaavi, along with Attorney Einav Itzco-Gold, and Deputy State Attorney Alon Altman, specializing in national security matters. Authorities say the suspects operated under the direction of two Iranian handlers with whom they maintained direct contact. Over the past two years, the spy cell is alleged to have carried out numerous missions for these agents, including the collection of photographs and information related to Israeli military installations. Payment for their activities reportedly amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars, transferred partly through cryptocurrency. Investigators emphasized that the espionage activities continued even during Israel’s ongoing conflict on multiple fronts, further underscoring the severity of the threat. The prosecution is expected to request that the suspects remain in custody until the end of legal proceedings.

Why is terror-supporting imam leading anti-IDF protests in Israel...	Sheikh Raed Salah is leading protests that slander Israeli soldiers and promote false genocide claims. By World Israel News Staff A radical imam who served time in prison for terror-related offenses is leading protests in Israel against the IDF, which include signs falsely alleging that Israeli soldiers are committing genocide in Gaza, a watchdog group warns. Images circulating on Arabic-language social media channels on Sunday evening showed Sheikh Ra'ed Salah at the forefront of demonstrations accusing the IDF of crimes against humanity in the Strip. Salah, an Islamic preacher and the leader of the outlawed Northern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel, stood next to a man holding a sign which called on Israeli troops to 'stop murdering women and children.' The imam has a long history of supporting terror and incitement against the Jewish State and its security forces. In 2003, he was convicted of fundraising for Hamas and served six months in prison. Salah served additional stints in prison for giving sermons that glorified violence against Jews and Israelis, as well as for assaulting a police officer in Jerusalem. 'Sheikh Ra'ed Salah was convicted of supporting terror. He lead a movement that was banned from operating in Israel during the Second Intifada due to its terror ties,' Maor Tzemach, Chariman of NGO Your Jersualem, told World Israel News. 'But now, he's the leader of protests against 'genocide.' He's front and center at these demonstrations that accuse Israel of serious human rights violations,' Tzemach continued. 'The sheikh's presence makes it clear that these aren't legitimate protests that are part of the discourse in a democratic society,' he added. Rather, Salah's participation proves that the demonstrations have a radical Islamic agenda, Tzemach said. 'There can't be a reality in which a convicted terror supporter is protesting against Israeli soldiers in such an inciteful matter, falsely accusing the IDF of genocide and stirring up hatred during an ongoing war,' Tzemach said. Tzemach called on the authorities to take steps to end the protests, which he described as 'hotbeds of incitement, that directly lead to the creation of new terrorists.' He also said it was critical for the security agencies to 'put a stop to Sheikh Ra'ed Salah's activities, including by charging him criminally for supporting terror.'

Israel will resettle the Gaza Strip, declares minister	Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip just a matter of time, vows senior Israeli government minister - but adds such a project is not part of the current war. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A senior Israeli government minister on Monday called for the resettlement of the Gaza Strip, saying the restoration of the coastal enclave's Jewish presence was both a necessity for Israeli security and an inevitability. In an opinion piece published by Arutz Sheva, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) compared the security situation on three different fronts, noting that the areas where Israel maintained a civilian presence, and not merely a military one, had greater long-term stability. 'Without settlement, there is no security,' Smotrich wrote. 'That is one of the clear lessons from October 7th and the Iron Swords War which we have been waging for the past year in the Gaza Strip and in Lebanon.' 'Reality has taught us that wherever we withdraw from is turned into a terrorist hotspot for Iran's proxies, and is used by terrorist elements to attack us.' While Israel had maintained security control through direct military intervention in both southern Lebanon and the Gaza Strip for decades, both areas were later withdrawn from, leaving them to become centers of terrorist activity against Israel. The IDF pulled out of southern Lebanon in May 2000, ending an 18-year presence. Five years later, the Sharon government evacuated the roughly 9,000 Israelis living in the Gaza Strip, and withdrew IDF forces during the Gaza Disengagement. But, Smotrich continued, 'In Judea and Samaria there is settlement, so despite the fact that we do have to fight terrorism there and always be 'trimming the grass,' the terrorism there can never reach the levels it has gotten to in Lebanon and Gaza.' 'Thanks to the settlements, Kfar Saba did not become [like] Kfar Azza,' Smotrich claimed. 'To be honest, it is fairly obvious to me that at the end of the day, there will be Jewish settlement of the Gaza Strip.' The finance minister also claimed that a majority of Israelis support resettling Gaza. 'I am convinced, and this is borne out in almost every poll, that there is today a majority of Jews who back resettling Gush Katif,' Smotrich wrote, referring to the largest bloc of Jewish towns in the Gaza Strip prior to 2005. Nevertheless, Smotrich emphasized that any moves towards resettlement will only begin after the current war is completed. 'It is important to emphasize that this is not one of the goals of the war, as they were defined by the government. Those war goals were defined for a wide consensus - destroying Hamas both as a military force and a civil entity, bringing the hostages back, establishing IDF security control for a period of years in order to prevent the rebuilding of the terror organizations and to remove the threat of being attacked from Gaza.'

‘That’s my house’: Gaza man discovers Sinwar was killed hiding in...	Gaza man discovers Yahya Sinwar was eliminated during a firefight in his home in Rafah, making the discovery only after watching footage of the Hamas leader's last moments. By World Israel News Staff A Gazan man made a grisly discovery regarding his house over the weekend, after watching footage circulating on the internet of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar's final moments, and the removal of his body after his death. Ashraf Abo Taha spoke with the BBC in a report published Saturday in which he recalled learning via social media that Sinwar had been killed in his home in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Sinwar - chairman of the Hamas politburo, architect of the October 7th attacks and chief of Hamas forces in Gaza - was shot and killed during a gun battle with Israeli troops in an abandoned building on Ibn Sena Street in Rafah on Wednesday, after IDF troops spotted terrorists outside of the building. The IDF troops were unaware that Sinwar was amongst the terrorists who had been hiding in the building, and engaged Sinwar and his bodyguards after spotting the armed men with a surveillance drone. After his death, footage was circulated on social media outlets of Sinwar during and immediately after the gun battle, along with photographs and footage taken during the removal of his body from the building. When Abo Taha's daughter showed him footage from Sinwar's final moments, he identified the building in question as his own home of 15 years, which he abandoned this May as Israel advised civilians to evacuate the city. 'I was like 'yes this is my house' and I saw the pictures and here I was shocked,' Abo Taha told the BBC. Abo Taha emphasized that neither he nor his family had offered the Hamas chief use of their home. 'Never ever did me and my brothers and sons have anything to do with this.' Lamenting the damage to his home and property, Abo Taha said 'Only God can compensate us.' 'What happened has saddened me a lot, the house that I built and all my payments are gone.'

‘Dangerous precedent’ – Ex-Israeli ambassador blasts Kamala Harri...	Former Israeli lawmaker and ambassador to the US Michael Oren takes aim at Vice President Kamala Harris after she appeared to justify heckler's accusations of Israeli genocide in Gaza. By World Israel News Staff A former Israeli lawmaker and ambassador to the United States excoriated Vice President Kamala Harris Sunday and demanded the Biden administration to speak out, after Harris appeared to justify an anti-Israel activist’s allegations of genocide in the Gaza Strip. Last Thursday, Vice President Harris and billionaire businessman and television personality Mark Cuban visited the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee for a campaign event, during which Harris addressed a gathering of students. A heckler wearing a keffiyeh interrupted Harris repeatedly during the event, accusing the Biden administration of enabling Israeli 'genocide' of Gazans. In response, Harris neither affirmed nor denied his claims, but did appear to justify his accusations, saying that she knows 'what you’re speaking of,' while emphasizing the administration’s efforts to secure an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. 'I know what you’re speaking of,' said Harris. 'I want a cease-fire. I want the hostage deal done. I want the war to end.' The heckler interrupted Harris’ response, saying: 'But what about the genocide? What about the genocide though?' Harris responded by saying: 'I respect your right to speak, but I’m speaking right now.' 'How about the billions of dollars to Israel?' the protester shouted. 'What about the 19,000 children dead, and you won’t call it a genocide?' 'Listen, what he’s talking about, it’s real,' said Harris in response. On Sunday afternoon, former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren, who also served as a Knesset Member and Deputy Minister, slammed Harris’ response and called on the White House to reject all claims of genocide in Gaza. 'A very dangerous precedent,' Oren tweeted. 'I was disturbed to view the video in which Vice President Kamala Harris appears to confirm the charge that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. This is the first time that the White House has been linked to a libel which threatens Israel’s legitimacy and security. I call on the U.S. administration to issue an immediate and complete denial.'

Trump: ‘You can’t blame Israel for hitting back hard’	Former President Donald Trump defends Israel's response to October 7th invasion, blames Biden administration's Iran policy for the attacks. By World Israel News Staff Former President Donald Trump defended Israel’s military response to the Hamas invasion of October 7th, while reiterating his claim that the attacks would not have occurred had he been in office in 2023. Speaking with the Dubai-based Al Arabiya outlet on Sunday, Trump lamented casualties and collateral damage in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, while blaming the October 7th invasion of Israel on the Biden administration’s policies vis-à-vis Iran, which the former president claimed encouraged Iran and its proxies to attack Israel. 'If I were president, that war would have never started,' Trump said. 'You wouldn’t have all those dead people, all those demolished cities and areas. You wouldn’t have had October 7th, that’s the most important.' Trump cited sanctions waivers provided by the Biden administration to Iran. 'If October 7th wouldn’t happen, which it wouldn’t have, because Iran funds it, and Iran had no money. They had no money. They had absolutely no money. And I would have made a deal with them, and they wouldn’t have done October 7th. But because they have no respect for Biden, they did it.' 'They had no money, and Biden allowed them to have $300 billion.' Israel, Trump continued, was justified in its response to the October 7th atrocities, saying the Jewish state 'hit back hard.' 'You can’t blame Israel for hitting back and they hit back hard. Much harder than anybody would have thought.' Touting his relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said he would, if elected, be able to bring peace to the region and expand the Abraham Accords. 'I want to see it all stop, I want to see the Middle East get back to peace – a real peace, a peace that is going to be a lasting peace,' Trump said. 'It’s gonna happen and it’s gonna happen soon.' '[Netanyahu] does listen to me,' Trump continued, noting his upcoming telephone conversation with the Israeli leader scheduled for Monday. Trump warned Israel not to adhere to Biden’s calls to refrain from making a substantial retaliatory attack on Iran in response to its massive October 1st ballistic missile attack. 'He is going to do what he wants to do and I think [Netanyahu] has to do that.' 'Biden has been historically horrible in foreign policy, incompetent.' 'Whatever he says, do the opposite, and you’ll be brilliant. But [Biden] gave [Netanyahu] instructions not to do anything, and Israel is under great danger – they’re under much less danger than they were a month ago.'

These are Israel’s demands for a ceasefire with Hezbollah	Israel demands freedom to continue fighting Hezbollah along the border, access to Lebanese airspace. By World Israel News Staff Israel provided the U.S. last week with a list of demands to end fighting against the Lebanon-based terror group Hezbollah, according to a report from Axios. Two Israeli officials and two American officials relayed the demands for a ceasefire to the outlet, which were mostly focused on ensuring that Israel maintains the right to continue military action against Hezbollah. Jerusalem is demanding 'active enforcement' against Hezbollah, presumably meaning that it can engage Hezbollah military to ensure it does not rebuild its terror infrastructure along the border. The Israeli Air Force also wants continued access to Lebanese airspace. A Biden administration official said it was 'highly unlikely' that the international community and Lebanon would not accept Israel's conditions for ending the war. The White House and U.S. State Department did not respond to media requests asking to confirm the report. The report comes as U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Amos Hochstein is set to visit Beirut on Monday in an attempt to secure a diplomatic solution to end the conflict. International criticism of Israel's war against Hezbollah has ramped up in recent days, as the IDF has destroyed UNIFIL outposts in southern Lebanon. Israel has argued that UNIFIL has failed to enforce UN Resolution 1701, which mandates that Hezbollah forces cannot be present south of the Litani River. Therefore, UNIFIL troops must withdraw from the area in order to enable the IDF to clear the region of Hezbollah terrorists and infrastructure. In a Sunday phone call, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed to Republican presidential candidate and former president Donald Trump that Israel will not bow to international pressure, including from Washington, regarding its prosecution of the war. Netanyahu 'reiterated what he has also said publicly: Israel takes into account the issues the U.S. administration raises, but in the end, will make its decisions based on its national interests,' read a statement from the Prime Minister's office.

Trump serves fries under the Golden Arches, drawing attention to ...	While her campaign originally said she worked there 'to pay her way through college,' Harris was forced to dial back that claim and has since said she worked the job for extra cash. By Joseph Simonson, The Washington Free Beacon In a made-for-TV effort to raise questions about one of his opponent's central campaign claims, former president Donald Trump worked a short shift at a Bucks County, Pa., McDonald’s on Sunday afternoon. Speaking through a drive-thru window at a Feasterville-Trevose McDonald’s franchise, Trump, sporting a McDonald’s apron, told reporters, 'Now I have worked at McDonald’s. I’ve now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala, she never worked here.' He was referring to Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris's claim to have worked at the fast-food chain for a summer during college. While her campaign originally said she worked there 'to pay her way through college,' Harris was forced to dial back that claim and has since said she worked the job for extra cash. Given the campaign's shifting narratives about the job, a Washington Free Beacon report in August raised questions about whether Harris had actually worked at McDonald's. Since then, neither she nor her campaign have substantiated the claim, though the New York Times on Sunday said it had located a Harris pal to whom Harris's deceased mother had mentioned the gig. 'The campaign did not make any of Ms. Harris's friends or family members available for interviews about their recollections of her experience there,' the Times said. Harris has stopped mentioning her stint at McDonald’s on the campaign trail since the Free Beacon report in August. The job was initially featured in super PAC ads and stump speeches. Trump’s visit to that particular McDonald’s was no coincidence. Located in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Bucks County is considered a critical swing district in the state. 'Well I do appreciate [McDonald’s’] a little bit more, yeah. You take it for granted, I’ll never forget this experience,' Trump told the Free Beacon when asked if his time at the fry station changed his opinion of the restaurant’s food. 'Now I know how to do it.' The Times on Sunday dubbed Trump’s claims that Harris never worked at McDonald’s 'burgerism,' a new form of 'birtherism,' a reference to the belief that former president Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Although the paper said Harris’s campaign 'did not make any of [her] friends or family members available for interviews about their recollections of her experience there,' it nonetheless concluded that Trump’s allegation 'appears to be false.' The Times, which credited six reporters with contributing to the story, left unmentioned the fact that the Harris campaign's claims about the job have changed and that Harris's biographer, Dan Morain, told the Free Beacon in August that he was 'not aware' that Harris had worked at McDonald's. Though the Harris campaign refused to provide any information to the Times about the circumstances of Harris's work at the restaurant, the paper wrote that 'as with the birtherism conspiracy theory, this one puts Ms. Harris and her aides in something of a bind. Tracking down pay stubs or other documentation from so long ago would be a difficult task for almost anyone.' Obama did in fact produce a birth certificate demonstrating that he was born in the United States.

‘A warrior and commander’: Israel mourns one of highest-ranking o...	Five colonels have fallen in combat since Hamas’s October 7 attack, and Daqsa is the highest-ranking officer to killed since then. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Israeli leaders mourned on Sunday the death of one of the highest-ranking army officers killed since the Gaza ground war began. Col. Ehsan Daqsa, who commanded the Israel Defense Force’s 401st Armored Brigade, was killed in battle in the Jabaliya area of northern Gaza. 'Ehsan was a hero of Israel, a warrior, and a commander — a role model for the bond with the Druze community. He dedicated his life to the security of Israel and its citizens. I extend my deepest sympathies to his wife Huda and their children, Omri, Reef, and Yasmin. We are all praying for the recovery of our brave wounded,' said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Daqsa and another battalion commander were critically injured by an explosive device when they exited their tanks to do a tactical observation. 'Known for his humility and valor, Daqsa had been leading his brigade since the start of the war and had previously received the Medal of Valor for his bravery during the Second Lebanon War,' Hagari said. 'On October 7, he transitioned directly from his studies into combat in the south and has been fighting ever since. He took command of the 401st Armored Brigade around four months ago.' Hagari added that Daqsa led the battle at Tel Sultan in Rafah when he assumed command and directed the brigade, 'which likely prevented [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar’s escape. From there, he continued to lead the battle in Jabaliya, where the brigade remains engaged. Ehsan led from the front and fell while guiding his soldiers.' Rafiq Halabi, Mayor of Daliyat al-Karmel local council, where Daqsa’s family resides, also paid tribute to Daqsa on X, formerly known as Twitter. 'He was a brave, legendary warrior who has fought since the beginning of the war. The Druze community, the IDF, and the State of Israel have lost one of their greatest heroes,' Halabi tweeted. The 41-year-old Daqsa is survived by his wife and three children. Five colonels have fallen in combat since Hamas’s October 7 attack, and Daqsa is the highest-ranking officer to killed since then. Eleven Druze soldiers, including Daqsa, have fallen in duty since October 7, including nine near or in Gaza, and two in northern Israel. Since Israel’s founding, 440 Druze soldiers have been killed in action. The Druze communities of Israel, Lebanon and Syria regard themselves as descendants of the Biblical Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses. They speak Arabic but are not Muslim. Around 152,000 Druze live in Israel, making up roughly two percent of the population. The Druze living in the Galilee and Mount Carmel areas sided with the Jews in 1948 during Israel’s War of Independence, opting to be part of Israeli society and establishing themselves in all areas of public life. The bond between Jewish and Druze soldiers is referred to as the 'covenant of blood.' At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Nova massacre survivor commits suicide on her 22nd birthday	The government needs to wake up. If it doesn't, there will be more cases like this,' says late Nova survior's brother. By World Israel News Staff A young woman who survived the Nova Festival massacre on October 7th committed suicide on her 22nd birthday, her family announced on Sunday evening. Shirel Golan, who escaped from the largest slaughter of Jews in a single incident since the Holocaust, was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and had been struggling with her mental health in the year since October 7th. According to her family members, Shirel hid in shrubbery for hours during the terror onslaught. Eventually, she tried to escape from the festival in a car driven by her friends, but then exited the vehicle and entered a police car. All 11 occupants of the civilian car were murdered by Hamas terrorists. Golan was one of some 200 survivors driven to safety in the police car by Officer Ramo Salman Abu-Zkeil. Her brother, Eyal, said that the state had failed to provide Shirel with adequate psychological support, despite the family's repeated attempts to get help for her. 'We are five siblings, and she was the youngest. The government needs to wake up. If it doesn't, there will be more cases like this,' he told Ynet. 'If the state had provided proper care, this wouldn't have happened. I've lost my sister, but I want to raise an outcry so others don't lose their loved ones.' Eyal told Channel 12 News that their 'mother was forced to take early retirement to be next to her daughter. We didn’t move a millimeter from her, and the only time we left her alone was today, and she decided to take her own life.' Abu-Zkeil said he was devastated by Golan's death, saying they had been in touch nearly every day since her rescue. 'On October 7th, I can say that I did the everything I could to prevent the people I rescued from seeing horrors. But the screams, the gunshots, and the images of what happened are things none of us can forget,' he told Walla. 'As a police officer, I receive talk therapy with a psychologist from the state. But Nova survivors only get pills.' The Ministry of Welfare and Social Services said in a statement that it 'expresses deep pain over the untimely death of the Nova survivor, and shares in the grief of the family and the sorrow of the entire Nova community.'

IDF still hasn’t internalized the tunnel threat, experts say	One of the reasons Israel has not fully embraced tunnels is that its attention and resources are drawn to other, more pressing threats. By David Isaac, JNS Tunnels have proven to be a critical threat to the Jewish state. While the Israel Defense Forces certainly hasn’t ignored them, it has been slow to grasp their strategic significance. Some argue that it still hasn’t. 'I still don’t see the necessary change in the IDF’s worldview that would allow us to better deal with this phenomenon of underground warfare,' Yehuda Kfir, a civil engineer and researcher of subterranean warfare, told JNS. Professor Joel Roskin, a geomorphologist at Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan, has reached the same conclusion. Perhaps the best supporting example is that when the IDF built its defensive 'smart wall' (completed in 2021) between Israel and the Gaza Strip, it continued to let Hamas build all the underground infrastructure it pleased as long as it stayed on its side of the fence. The resulting underground city in Gaza, from which Hamas could command and control its forces, send them out to attack and recall them to shelter in place, has served to prolong the war and prevent Israel from saving the remaining hostages. It allowed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to elude Israeli forces for more than a year. Sinwar himself (along with 1,026 others) was released from Israeli prison in 2011 in exchange for IDF soldier Gilad Shalit—who had been kidnapped by terrorists who emerged from a tunnel. Kfir posits that Oct. 7 wouldn’t have happened if not for Hamas’s extensive tunnel system. 'Sinwar would not have dared invade as he did without this underground system from which he could continue to survive and function,' he told JNS. Kfir and Roskin’s conclusions have been echoed elsewhere. Asher Katz, an IDF reservist specializing in tunnels, said in an interview with David Harris of the Jewish Broadcasting Service in late September that it wasn’t until 2021 that it dawned on Israel that the tunnels were more than a Hamas tactic, (i.e., a way to move fighters from one place to another). They were rather Hamas’s entire 'strategic thesis,' he said; a means to fight, hide and survive. Hamas was thinking strategically, but Israel was thinking tactically, Asher said, adding, 'Israelis were super good at solving problems. Give us a problem, we’ll solve it. I don’t think we’re that good at strategy. Or we haven’t been good enough at strategy.' Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman told interviewer Dave Rubin on Oct. 9 that if he had one criticism of Israel’s Gaza war it was that it was taking too long, a fact he attributed to Hamas’s tunnel system. 'They [Hamas] got 350 miles’ worth of terror tunnels,' he said, adding that the Israelis didn’t understand what they were dealing with. 'Hamas, I say, had the greatest home court advantage in the history of ground warfare.' The IDF has significantly improved its tunnel operations over the last year, Kfir acknowledges, pointing to the army’s decision to move its forces underground in tandem with its above-ground forces. In the clip below, IDF Brig. Gen. Dan Goldfus describes such simultaneous troop movements. Israel is using the enemy’s own tunnels to advance. But Kfir said that’s not enough, that Israel is still leaving the initiative to the enemy. The modern battlefield has become multi-level, but Israel is neglecting an entire level, he said. He likens it to a Navy without submarines, one that operates only on the surface. Kfir and Roskin, who concede they’re currently in the minority on the topic, argue that Israel must build its own attack tunnels. The concept may sound 'sci-fi,' but they depict a subterranean battlefield in which Israeli forces dig tunnels to carry out their own operations and to counter those of the enemy. Said Roskin, 'If you don’t dig yourself and experience the construction process, the routine of life within a tunnel, you don’t really understand what it’s all about.' Kfir and Roskin recently distributed a report on offensive tunneling to various individuals in the IDF, from engineering, intelligence, research and development and other units. 'Nobody called us even to discuss it,' said Roskin. One of the reasons is that responsibility for tunnels is diffuse. There isn’t a single address for tunnels in the army. Kfir and Roskin argue an organizational change needs to take place—the establishment of an IDF branch dedicated solely to underground warfare. The IDF tells JNS that tunnels are handled by Yahalom, a special forces unit of the Israeli Combat Engineering Corps. However, Yahalom’s duties include more than just tunnels. When asked by JNS about a special tunnel lab set up in 2018, the 'Technological Laboratory for Tunnel Detection and Locations,' which specifically focuses on detecting and locating tunnels, the IDF said that it operates under the Gaza Division, separate from Yahalom. 'We have been advocating, given the wide ranges of uses of tunnels by Hamas, and now by Hezbollah, a separate branch, or at least a large research-to-engagement unit in the military,' said Roskin. The IDF is only now learning the extent of Hezbollah’s tunnels in southern Lebanon. Early last week, it uncovered an 800-meter (~0.5 mile) tunnel designed as a launching pad for an attack on northern Israel. According to reports, Hezbollah had planned its own Oct. 7-style massacre on Israel’s northern communities (its scale would have been far worse than the Hamas attack, the reports say). After visiting the tunnel, Channel 14’s military reporter Noam Amir said it was larger than the IDF’s 800-meter estimate, because there were turn-offs to rooms, one containing a giant generator, another a huge hangar, and others leading to sleeping quarters, kitchens and weapons stores. 'I walked for 45 minutes, which felt like several kilometers,' he said. 'They [Hezbollah] have food there for many months. With a long shelf life, you could divide it up for years. It’s not the dates and nuts that were given to the terrorists in the tunnels in Gaza. And you see mopeds. And you see a room for terrorists with plasma TVs … And you say to yourself, what have they built under our noses for more than two decades?' said Amir. One of the reasons Israel has not fully embraced tunnels is that its attention and resources are drawn to other, more pressing threats. 'Missiles travel 15,000 miles per hour. Tunnels advance one-to-five meters per day,' Roskin pointed out. Underground warfare is not just Israel’s problem, but a world problem, Kfir said. This is in part because bad actors have been inspired by Hamas’s ability to last as long as it has, despite Israel’s entire military and political establishment being mobilized against it. America is quietly concerned about China invading Taiwan via tunnel, Kfir noted, saying it is possible engineering-wise to dig under the Taiwan Strait. 'The Chinese are taking over the world market in TBM (Tunnel Boring Machines),' he said. 'There is almost no company today in this field that is not controlled by them.' Will tunnels again become a threat from Gaza? That fear is already being aired by some. IDF Lt. Col. (ret.) Jonathan Conricus has voiced his concerns that the military may not be doing enough to counter a future tunnel threat under the Philadelphi Corridor along the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. The IDF is going after specific tunnel entrances in a 'pinpoint solution' rather than a 'systemic solution' that deals with all the tunnels, Conricus told JNS. 'What’s needed is to create a permanent change, or at least one that’s more long lasting.' Conricus suggests an underground barrier, 'a type of defensive wall,' similar to what Israel built around the Gaza Strip, which prevented Hamas from using tunnels in their Oct. 7 attack. It’s called a 'slurry wall' and involves 'digging a deep trench, dozens of meters deep, and filling it with concrete that has sensors in it, that basically cuts across the border. It doesn’t make it impossible to dig a tunnel, but it makes it very, very difficult,' he said. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that Israel will keep troops in the Philadelphi Corridor, Conricus said there are no guarantees. Pressure is being applied by the United States and Egypt, putting a damper on the idea. A slurry wall would give Israel at least some measure of control over what happens under the Strip if it is forced to leave, he said. The Philadelphi Corridor is where all the problems started, Kfir noted. In the 1980s, Israel had its first encounter with tunnels in the form of underground smuggling by terrorists. The IDF struggled to counter it. The terrorists’ initial success led them to expand their use of tunnels, planting explosives under IDF outposts. They blew up their first in 2001. Roskin said Israeli troops will need to be on the border. 'If Israel wants to have control of the Gaza Strip, they have to control the Philadelphi Corridor, hands-on, on the ground,' he said. Even IDF officers who advocated for the 2005 disengagement from Gaza argued at the time that Israel must keep the Philadelphi Corridor. 'They were pretty shocked that [then-Prime Minister] Ariel Sharon was going to give up Philadelphi. We’ve seen the price we’ve paid,' said Roskin.

Trump clears margin of error in crucial swing state	With its 16 electoral votes, North Carolina is one of seven consensus battleground states that collectively control 93 electoral votes. By Jewish Breaking News With the 2024 presidential election expected to come down to the wire, political pundits widely agree North Carolina may very well be the deciding factor in who takes the White House this November. A fresh poll from Rasmussen Reports and American Thinker shows Trump leading Vice President Kamala Harris by 51% to 46% among likely voters in North Carolina. With a margin of error of +/- 3% and a 95% level of confidence, this marks the first time either candidate has secured a statistically significant advantage in the state. On key issues, the economy remains the top concern for North Carolina voters at 33%, followed by border security at 17% and abortion at 12%. Significantly, 70% of respondents prefer 'major change' in how the next president governs rather than 'business as usual.' However, voters seemed to place very little importance (3%) on global conflicts, such as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. With its 16 electoral votes, North Carolina is one of seven consensus battleground states that collectively control 93 electoral votes. Trump’s appeal in North Carolina has been consistent across the last two presidential cycles. He claimed victory in 2020 with 49.9% of the vote versus 48.6% for Biden-Harris, mirroring his 2016 win where he garnered 49.8% to Clinton-Kaine’s 46.2%. In both instances, Trump’s final numbers exceeded predictions from September and October polls. Historically, North Carolina has consistently leaned Republican in presidential races for over half a century. Since Lyndon B. Johnson’s victory in 1964, Democrats have only managed to capture the state twice with Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Barack Obama in 2008.

Abandon Harris'—formerly 'Abandon Biden'—demands a 'permanent and unconditional ceasefire' and 'a full arms embargo against the State of Israel,' according to the group’s website. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon The anti-Israel organization 'Abandon Harris' expanded its movement into Wisconsin and Georgia in order 'to ensure that Kamala Harris loses the swing states,' the Washington Times reported. In a bid to divert votes from Harris in response to her stance on the Israel-Hamas war, the group is promoting Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who has pledged to end all military support to Israel. 'Abandon Harris,' which began in Michigan, expanded its campaigns to Wisconsin and Georgia this week as Harris and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump remain in a tight battle in the key swing states. 'Abandon Harris'—formerly 'Abandon Biden'—demands a 'permanent and unconditional ceasefire' and 'a full arms embargo against the state of Israel,' according to the group’s website. 'We have become familiar with the way in which the president and vice president double-talk to our community by making vague allusions of ending the genocidal war while permitting the state of Israel to continue their attacks on innocent people on the verge of disintegration,' Hassan Abdel Salam, a spokesman for the group, told the Washington Times. Salam told the Times that Harris teases talks of a ceasefire in Gaza only to court Arab-American voters. 'The vice president engages in ‘cease-fire teasing’—a common practice that began with [President Biden]—by claiming that a cease-fire is on the horizon while children, women, and men are in flames, burning before our eyes,' he said. The 'Abandon Harris' group’s expansion into the two swing states comes as Harris struggles to regain the support of Arab-American voters, who historically supported Democrats before the start of the Israel-Hamas war. An October Arab American Institute survey found that the national Arab-American vote is split between Trump and Harris, 42 percent to 41 percent. Harris remains 18 points below Biden’s 2020 level of support with Arab-American voters. Among Muslim voters in Wisconsin, Harris trails Stein, 44 percent to 39 percent, while Trump holds only 8 percent of the vote, according to a poll from Marquette University.

Sinwar’s wife blasted for carrying $32,000 Birkin handbag	The Birkin line of luxury handbags, made by Hermes, a French company, cost tens of thousands of dollars. By Pesach Benson, TPS Yahya Sinwar’s wife, Samar Abu Zamer, was blasted on social media on Sunday after surveillance footage released by Israel showed her carrying what appears to be a $32,000 handbag as she and her family went into hiding. 'Did Sinwar’s wife enter the tunnel with him on October 6, carrying a Birkin bag estimated to cost about $32,000?! I will leave the comment to you,' tweeted Col. Avichay Adraee, the Israel Defense Force’s Arabic-language spokesperson. 'While the people of Gaza do not have enough money for a tent or basic necessities, we see many examples of Yahya Sinwar and his wife’s special love for money,' Adraee added. The footage dated October 6, 2023, the day before Hamas’s attack on Israel, showed Sinwar, his two children and Abu Zamer passing through a tunnel. She was carrying what appeared to be a French-made Birkin handbag. The Birkin line of luxury handbags, made by Hermes, a French company, cost tens of thousands of dollars. 'Yes. That appears to be a black Hermes Birkin 25, estimated retail value $32,500 — but you also have to buy $32,500 (an equal amount) at Hermes to qualify to buy,' tweeted writer Emily Zanotti. 'So let’s say, conservatively, they stole $65K from Gaza residents just to buy Sinwar’s wife a handbag.' Sinwar, who masterminded the October 7 attacks was killed in a chance encounter with Israeli soldiers in Rafah on Thursday. He had a personal wealth of several million dollars, not close to the billions personally accumulated by Ismail Haniyeh, Khalid Mashaal. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Hezbollah launches 100 rockets at Israel’s Galilee	Police reported closures along Route 90 from north to south from the Rosh Pina Junction to the Amiad Junction following the launches. By JNS Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah launched approximately 100 rockets at northern Israel on Sunday, in two barrages. The first was a salvo of 70 rockets targeting northern Israel’s Western and Upper Galilee regions late Sunday morning, the Israel Defense Forces said. Some of the projectiles were intercepted, while several impacts were detected, according to the IDF. Israel Fire and Rescue Services were operating to extinguish multiple fires sparked by the attack. There were no immediate reports of injuries or material damage. Just a few hours later, the Iranian terror proxy launched some 30 rockets at Safed and surrounding areas of the Upper Galilee. Sirens also sounded in Katzrin in the southern Golan Heights. Residents of Safed reported multiple interceptions in the skies over the city. No injuries or direct hits were reported, but several fires were reported. Police reported closures along Route 90 from north to south from the Rosh Pina Junction to the Amiad Junction following the launches. One rocket exploded on the road near the Elifelet interchange. Red Alerts in Safed pic.twitter.com/U3Z23i111g &mdash; Netanel Worthy - נתנאל וורתי (@NetanelWorthy) October 20, 2024 Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli Air Force intercepted a 'suspicious aerial target' off the coast of Haifa. Per IDF protocol, no sirens were sounded because the threat, apparently a drone, did not make landfall. The incident came a day after a Hezbollah drone attack on the Caesarea residents of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Shortly afterward on Sunday morning, sirens sound in the northwestern port city and the surrounding area, as well as in the Upper Galilee. Residents reported hearing one interception; Magen David Adom emergency services said they had received no calls about impacts or casualties. The military later confirmed that it shot down one rocket and that two projectiles fell in an open area in a second wave at northern Israel. Sirens had sounded in Merom Golan in the northern Golan Heights at around 4:20 a.m. on Sunday due to a drone that had crossed into Israeli airspace from Syria. The threat was intercepted by the Israeli Air Force. Another drone had triggered sirens in several communities in the southern Golan several hours earlier. That drone too was intercepted, as was another UAV approaching from the east that according to the IDF did not enter Israeli airspace. A drone was also intercepted on Saturday night near Eilat in southern Israel. No injuries were reported in either the Golan and Eilat drone attacks, which were claimed by the Islamic Resistance of Iraq, a group of Iranian-backed militias. The terrorist group has conducted many drone attacks against Israel over the past year in support of Hamas in Gaza. Alarms were also heard elsewhere in northern Israel overnight, including in the Upper Galilee area, where five projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon around midnight, according to the IDF, which said that some were intercepted while others fell in open areas. On Saturday morning, a Hezbollah drone impacted near Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea. The drone was one of three launched by Hezbollah, two of which were intercepted. The Lebanese terrorist group launched some 200 projectiles at Israel throughout Saturday. One of the rockets killed a man near Acre, who was later identified as Alexei Popov, 51, from the Haifa suburb of Kiryat Haim.

ISIS terror attack on Israeli embassy in Germany foiled	Terrorist plot orchestrated by Libyan affiliated with ISIS targeted Israel's mission to Berlin, German authorities announce. By World Israel News Staff German authorities foiled a planned terrorist attack against the Israeli embassy in Berlin over the weekend, the state prosecutor’s office announced on Sunday. The suspect has been identified only as 'Omar A.,' a 28-year-old Libyan national residing in Germany who according to a statement by the Public Prosecutor of Germany’s office, is affiliated with the Islamic State in Syria terrorist organization. Omar A. allegedly contacted an ISIS operative abroad via an online chat service to assist him in planning the attack. After the attack, Omar A. had planned to find refuge at his uncle’s residence, before fleeing the country, Bild reported. Prosecutors did not reveal details of the suspect’s planned attack. Police arrested Omar A. on Saturday in Bernau, a town near Berlin, local media outlets reported. Omar is slated to be brought before a Federal Court of Justice on Monday for an extension of his remand. According to a statement by a spokesperson for the national prosecutor, police were tipped off about the terror plot by a foreign intelligence agency, while declining to name which country was involved in foiling the attack. 'Muslim antisemitism is no longer just hateful rhetoric; it leads to and encourages terrorist activities worldwide,' said Israeli Ambassador to Germany Ron Prosor on Sunday. 'This is yet another example of Israeli embassies being on the front line of the diplomatic battlefield. I would like to commend the German law enforcement authorities for their intensive efforts to ensure the safety of the official representatives of the State of Israel.' Nancy Faeser, the Federal Minister of the Interior and Community of Germany, touted Omar A.’s timely arrest. 'Our security authorities acted in time to thwart possible plans to attack the Israeli embassy in Berlin,’ Faeser tweeted on Sunday. 'This shows that protecting Jewish and Israeli institutions in our country is vital and of the utmost importance to us.'

British lawmakers, city officials demand full arms embargo on Isr...	Members of ruling Labour Party back parliamentary motion calling on Stamer government to ban all military exports to Israel. By World Israel News Staff Dozens of British lawmakers have signed on to a parliamentary motion demanding the Starmer government ban all sales of weapons and military equipment to Israel, despite a pledge by Prime Minister Keir Starmer not to impose a sweeping arms embargo on the Jewish state. Separately, over 100 British city councillors have petitioned the government to adopt a similar arms embargo. Earlier this month, a total of 51 Members of Parliament in the 650-member legislature backed a measure, an Early Day Motion proposed by Leeds East MP Richard Burgon, which demands the British government nix the 2030 Roadmap for UK-Israel Bilateral Relations, a sweeping agreement signed in 2023 aimed at deepening cooperation between the two countries with regards to cyber technology, security, health, climate change, to promote increased trade. The motion, dubbed 'UN’s Resolution on Israel’s Illegal Occupation of Palestine and Sanctions,' also calls on Britain to end 'all military exports to Israel,' citing a United Nations General Assembly non-binding resolution, and to ban imports from Israeli towns outside of the pre-1967 Green Line. The UN measure, drafted by the Palestinian Authority mission and passed on September 18th, called for sanctions on Israel and a global arms embargo. The EDM submitted to the British Parliament similarly calls on London to 'act in support of the UN resolution and ICJ opinion including by ending all military exports to Israel, banning the import of goods from illegal Israeli settlements and revoking the 2030 Roadmap which deepens UK economic, trade and security ties with Israel.' Twenty-one Labour MPs signed onto the motion, with 30 other MPs including independents and lawmakers from the Scottish Independence Party, the Green Party, the Liberal Democrats, and Plaid Cymru backing the measure. In addition, last week, 114 Muslim city councillors aligned with the Labour Party signed a petition calling on Starmer to impose an 'immediate and complete suspension of arms sales to Israel.' 'In the past few days alone we have seen images of Palestinian children and families burnt alive following Israeli military strikes at Al Aqsa hospital, and the continued shelling of schools used as shelter by displaced civilians,' the petition, drafted by the Labour Muslim Network, reads. 'That is why we have come together, as councillors, as Muslims, and as Labour members, to call on this Labour government to meet our moral obligation by suspending all arms sales to Israel until such a time that international humanitarian law is observed and respected.' A day before the Early Day Motion was brought before Parliament, Prime Minister Starmer declared that he would not back a comprehensive arms embargo on Israel, calling it the 'wrong position.' 'Banning all sales would mean none for defensive purposes.' 'None for defensive purposes on the anniversary of October 7 and days after a huge attack by Iran into Israel would be a wrong position for this government and I will not take it,' Starmer continued.

Professor of international law calls Sinwar’s killing ‘murder,’ d...	Canadian international law professor specializing in war crimes decries elimination of top Hamas terrorist as ‘murder,’ demands Canada push for investigation of IDF’s killing of Yahya Sinwar. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Israeli military’s killing of the leader of the Hamas terror organization was illegal under international law, constitutes murder, and is a war crime, a Canadian international law professor claims, pushing the Canadian government to demand an investigation of the incident. Heidi Matthews, an international law professor focusing on the study of laws of war at the York University in Toronto’ Osgoode Hall Law School, on Friday lambasted Israel’s elimination of Hamas politburo chairman and chief of Hamas forces in the Gaza Strip Yahya Sinwar. Sinwar, the architect of the October 7th, 2023, invasion of Israel and massacre of 1,200 Israelis, was killed Wednesday during a gun battle with IDF troops in Tel al-Sultan in the southern edge of Rafah near the Egyptian border. During the battle between Sinwar, his bodyguards, and IDF forces, an Israeli soldier was seriously wounded. An IDF tank sent to support the troops opened fire on the building where Sinwar was holed up, leaving the terrorist leader injured. Despite his injuries, Sinwar managed to throw several hand grenades at IDF soldiers as they stormed the building, forcing them to withdraw, while the tank’s machine gun turret and other soldiers provided covering fire aimed at Sinwar. A drone aircraft was sent into the building to ascertain Sinwar’s condition. The wounded terrorist threw a piece of wood in an attempt to knock down the drone. Sinwar’s remains were later found with an AK-47 assault rifle. A day after Sinwar’s killing, shortly after forensics investigators in Israel confirmed his identity, French Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hailed Sinwar’s death, calling it the end of 'a reign of terror' in the Gaza Strip. 'Under Sinwar’s leadership, Hamas carried out the horrific atrocities of October 7, sought to destroy Israel, and launched senseless, devastating terror attacks on civilians across the region. Today delivers a measure of justice for his victims and their families,' Trudeau said. Taking to X/Twitter Friday, Matthews called on Trudeau’s government to push for a probe of Sinwar’s killing, claiming that it constituted murder and a war crime. 'There is good reason to believe that Sinwar was, in fact, murdered by the IDF,’ Matthews wrote. 'Rather than celebrating death using inflammatory language of ‘elimination’, Canada should be demanding that Israel comply with an independent investigation into the circumstances of Sinwar's death.' Sinwar, Matthews argued, could no longer be considered a combatant and thus a legitimate target after being wounded, claiming the additional shots fired were prohibited under the 1949 Geneva Convention. 'Briefly for now: individuals who are rendered 'hors to combat' (no longer in the fight) by virtue of wounding cannot be targeted. To do so is a violation of common article 3 to the 1949 Geneva Conventions and a war crime under the art. 8(2)(c)(i) of the Rome Statute.' 'The relevant question is whether Sinwar was incapacitated by his wounds such that he was disabled from participating in fighting and no longer posed a threat. This question is easier to answer when fighters are unconscious or on the ground.'

‘If Israel had listened to Biden, Sinwar would still be alive’ – ...	Israel's elimination of top Hamas terrorist was a result of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's defiance of the Biden administration's efforts to end the Gaza war, block Israel from entering Rafah, experts say. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration last week congratulated Israel and the IDF on the killing of Yahya Sinwar - chief of the Hamas politburo, leader of Hamas forces in the Gaza Strip, and architect of the October 7th invasion – lauding his elimination as 'relief' and the removal of 'an insurmountable obstacle' to ceasefire talks. A number Middle East and counter-terrorism experts, however, say Sinwar’s elimination would not have been possible had Israel followed calls by the Biden administration to end the war against Hamas or caved to pressure from the White House not to enter the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where Sinwar was ultimately shot and killed. Since the beginning of 2024, the Biden administration has urged Israel to end its war in the Gaza Strip and reach a permanent ceasefire with Hamas. At the same time, the White house repeatedly warned Israel not to enter Rafah, saying a large-scale operation in the city, which prior to the operation housed roughly half of Gaza’s population – most of them internally displaced refugees – would inevitably result in massive civilian casualties. 'We have been clear in multiple conversations and in every way that any major military operation in Rafah would be a huge mistake,' Harris told ABC News in March.'Let me tell you something. I have studied the maps. There's nowhere for those folks to go.' Even after IDF forces launched the Rafah offensive on May 6th, seizing control over the border crossings with Egypt, the White house persisted in pressuring Israel not to advance into the city of Rafah itself. 'The president doesn’t want to see operations in Rafah that put at greater risk the more than a million people that are seeking refuge there,' White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on May 6th, after Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone, urging him not to expand the ground operation into Rafah proper. Two days later, Biden warned that he would bar the transfer of heavy aerial ordinance to Israel if the IDF entered the city of Rafah. 'I made it clear that if they go into Rafah – they haven’t gone in Rafah yet – if they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities – that deal with that problem,' Biden told CNN. American-Israeli journalist Caroline Glick, who ran for Knesset with Naftali Bennett in 2019, excoriated Kamala Harris over her March comments, tweeting: 'Sinwar was killed in Rafah - a mile from the Egyptian border. Kamala threatened Israel with sanctions if we went in. Oh, and she studied the maps.' Lt. Col. (Res.) Yoni Chetboun, a former Israeli lawmaker who served as Deputy Speaker of the Knesset and former officer in the IDF’s elite Egoz counter-terror unit, told Fox News that had Israel adhered to the Biden administration’s demands, Sinwar would not have been eliminated. 'Had Prime Minister Netanyahu listened to Biden and Harris and not entered Rafah, we may have never reached Sinwar. The people of America and Israel overwhelmingly supported our entry into Rafah and want to see Hamas committed to the annals of history. Now it's time to finish Hamas and bring home the hostages.' Counter-terrorism expert and Northwestern University professor Max Abrahms echoed Chetboun’s comments. 'Had Netanyahu heeded that advice, Sinwar would be alive,' Abrahms told Fox News. 'Israel is safer for ignoring this White House, an important lesson as Netanyahu weighs military options against Iran.' When asked last Thursday whether the administration’s calls not to enter Rafah had been mistaken in light of Sinwar’s elimination, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller refused to walk back the administration’s admonitions. 'No, I will say that we always made clear that we supported Israel conducting counterterrorism operations to target the leaders of Hamas and to target Hamas militants. And not only did we make clear we supported it, but we provided active intelligence support for those operations. And I think I’ll leave it at that.'

Entrepreneur offers $100,000 reward to Gazans for hostage info	Former SodaStream CEO offers to personally pay Gazans who provide intelligence leading to the rescue of living hostages. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli entrepreneur has pledged to personally pay a $100,000 reward in cash or Bitcoin to Gazans who provide information leading to the recovery of living Israeli hostages still held in the Strip. Daniel Birnbuam, the former CEO of SodaStream, released a video including Arabic subtitles offering a financial incentive to Gazans who could assist in locating captives. 'This year was a terrible year. It's time to wrap things up and move on. A few days ago, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered free passage and immunity to anyone who delivers an Israeli prisoner to Israel,' Birnbaum said in the video. 'I would like to add to that a financial reward. Anyone who delivers from Gaza a living Israeli prisoner will receive $100,000&#8230;don't wait. This offer is valid is offer until Wednesday, midnight, October 24th,' he continued. Birnbaum then provided a phone number, which he said Gazans can reach either via WhatsApp or Telegram. He promised that the identities of those who contact the hotline will be kept private, and that he will 'make the appropriate arrangements' to ensure their safe passage out of the Strip. 'Don't wait. It's time to take control of your life, to build a future for yourself, for your family, and for your community. Do it today,' he added. In an interview on Sunday morning, Birnbaum clarified that he is working 'shoulder to shoulder' with Israel's security apparatus. The hotline has 'already been flooded with 50 messages,' Birnbaum told the Morning News with Niv Raskin. 'Of course, some of them are fake, but they are all being seriously examined by intelligence services.' Birnbaum stressed that his offer marks 'the first time that cash has been on the table for the release of the hostages.' He said he hoped that the financial reward would provide a push to motivate Gazans to disclose intelligence that could save hostages' lives. 'It's time to try something new,' he said.

2 IDF soldiers killed in northern Gaza’s Jabaliya	Two soldiers killed by anti-tank missile during offensive against Hamas in the northern Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff Two Israeli soldiers were killed during combat in the city of Jabaliya on Saturday, as the IDF intensifies its offensive against Hamas terrorists still in the northern Gaza Strip. The two fallen troops were identified in an IDF press release as Staff Sgt. Ofir Berkovich, 20, from the central city of Modi’in, and Sgt. Elishai Young, 19, from the southern city of Dimona. Both soldiers were serving in the 401st Armored Brigade’s 52nd Battalion. According to a statement from the IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, they were killed when their armored vehicle was struck by an anti-tank missile fired by Hamas terrorists. Berkovich, who had finished nearly all of his mandatory service, was already planning a post-army intentional trip with his brothers, his family said. His parents, Oren and Aviv, said that his organs would be donated to save the lives of others. 'On behalf of all the residents of the city of Dimona, I share in the Young family's grief over the death of their son Elishai, a hero of Israel,' said Benny Biton, the mayor of Dimona, in a media statement. 'Elishai belongs to the Hebrew Israelite community in the city,' Biton said, referring to a group of African-Americans who claim Jewish roots that immigrated to southern Israel several decades ago from the U.S. The Black Israelites are 'a community that donates and volunteers' for the betterment of Israeli society, Biton said. He noted that the community has a '100% enlistment rate in the IDF, indicating their love for the country and their desire to integrate into it, especially for its defense.' The killing of Berkovich and Young bring the death toll in the Israeli offensive in Gaza to 357. That number includes Yamam special forces police officer Arnon Zmora, who was killed during a June hostage rescue operation, and a civilian Defense Ministry contractor who was killed in May.

‘It’s real’ – Kamala Harris justifies protester’s claims of Israe...	I know what you're speaking of' - Vice President Kamala Harris legitimizes anti-Israel protesters accusations of genocide in the Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff Vice President Kamala Harris justified accusations posed by an anti-Israel protester who crashed a campaign event Thursday, after the protester claimed Israel is committing genocide in the Gaza Strip. Harris was joined by billionaire businessman and television personality Mark Cuban in a campaign stop at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Thursday, as the vice president's campaign works to bolster support in the battleground state where former President Donald Trump currently holds a 0.2% lead in the RealClearPolitics average of polls. During a gathering with students, an anti-Israel activist wearing a keffiyeh challenged Harris over the Biden administration's handling of the war in Gaza, claiming that the U.S. is enabling Israeli 'genocide' of Gazans. After the protester accused Israel of genocide, Harris neither affirmed nor denied his claims, but did appear to justify his accusations, saying that she knows 'what you're speaking of,' while reiterating the administration's call for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas terror organization. 'I know what you're speaking of,' said Harris. 'I want a cease-fire. I want the hostage deal done. I want the war to end.' The heckler interrupted Harris' response, repeating his claims of genocide in Gaza. 'But what about the genocide? What about the genocide though?' Harris attempted to silence the protester, saying: 'I respect your right to speak, but I'm speaking right now.' The protester continued to shout at the vice president as security guards removed him from the gathering. 'How about the billions of dollars to Israel?' the protester shouted. 'What about the 19,000 children dead, and you won't call it a genocide?' After the protester was removed, Harris continued to justify his claims, saying 'it's real.' 'Listen, what he’s talking about, it’s real,' said Harris. 'That’s not the subject that I came to discuss today, but it’s real, and I respect his voice.'

An assault rifle, an UNRWA passport, and $11K in cash: What Sinwa...	The presence of an UNRWA passport in Sinwar's belongings is another blow to the humanitarian aid agency's already ailing image. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon When Israeli forces examined Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar's body after killing him in a surprise ground operation on Thursday, they discovered several curious items, including grenades, an assault rifle, nearly $11,000 in cash, and a passport belonging to an employee of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. Those items, experts told the Washington Free Beacon, suggest Sinwar may have been attempting to flee the embattled Gaza Strip when Israeli forces stumbled upon him inside a house in the territory's Rafah neighborhood, Hamas's stronghold along the border with Egypt. While it is unclear exactly what Sinwar was up to in that home, the documents in his possession hint at an escape plan. 'One big question is whether he was planning to try and run for it and run out of Gaza,' said Jonathan Conricus, a 24-year Israel Defense Forces veteran who now serves as a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank. It's particularly curious, Conricus said, given that Sinwar is known to have had access to the sophisticated Hamas-built tunnel network running beneath Gaza and could have used it to flee into Egypt. The IDF worked earlier this year to demolish many of those cross-border tunnels, complicating a prospective Sinwar exit. The presence of an UNRWA passport in Sinwar's belongings is another blow to the humanitarian aid agency's already ailing image. The United States and other Western countries froze aid to UNRWA after reports revealed that several of the agency's employees had participated in Hamas's Oct. 7 terror massacre. Since that time, Hamas has repeatedly been caught siphoning off aid and continuing to use UNRWA facilities for safe haven and even operational planning. 'Having access to a humanitarian passport—even if expired in 2017—could possibly provide access to humanitarian corridors to evacuate a crisis zone,' said Riza Kumar, a research analyst with the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit policy group. 'Given that only two others died alongside Sinwar, his small entourage suggests he was attempting to make moves that wouldn't be so easily detected.' Sinwar was killed alongside his longtime bodyguard and another senior Hamas member responsible for handling the terror leader's communications with the outside world. It is possible the UNRWA-issued passport and various Palestinian government IDs found at the site of Sinwar's death could have helped the small cohort of terrorists make their way to safer territory as Israeli forces patrol Rafah, hunting down Hamas's remaining terrorists. 'The fact Sinwar felt compelled to leave his secure subterranean hideout and emerge into the Tal as-Sultan streets, with only two other fighters in support, suggests a severe disintegration of Hamas command-and-control structures,' Kumar said. 'Likely Sinwar had also lost confidence in his senior commanders in taking such a risk.' At the same time, Kumar said, 'carrying the passport of a much younger man, with a 1984 [birthdate], probably rules out the notion of [Sinwar's] intending to use it or flee across the Egypt-Gaza border.' UNRWA says that it had no knowledge of Sinwar's whereabouts and that the presence of its employee's passport at the scene does not mean the aid group was in communication with Hamas's now-former leader. 'I confirm that the staff member in question is alive,' UNRWA commissioner-general Philippe Lazzarini wrote on X. 'He currently lives in Egypt where he traveled with his family in April through the Rafah border.' The organization would not comment beyond this statement when reached Friday by the Free Beacon. But Sinwar's access to such a sensitive UNRWA document is still raising questions months after the organization was forced to admit that its employees not only played a role in the Oct. 7 attacks but also helped Hamas hide hostages. 'UNRWA is totally compromised. Every part of UNRWA is connected with Hamas, benefits Hamas, and in many cases, works for Hamas,' said Conricus. Anne Herzberg, a human rights lawyer and NGO Monitor legal adviser, noted that the discovery of UNRWA documents 'is indicative of the corruption and failure of that U.N. agency specifically, but the humanitarian aid industry in Gaza more generally.' Sinwar was also carrying Mentos candies when he was killed, items only available by having access to the tons of humanitarian aid being pumped into Gaza by UNRWA and international donors. That type of item, Conricus said, only 'comes in through the humanitarian aid, so obviously he had access, through his people or someone else, to get access to Mentos.' The former Israeli soldier also noted a curious omission from the goods found on Sinwar's body: a Quran. 'Even the most junior Hamas fighters, usually when they die, you find them with the Quran,' he said, describing Sinwar's lack of one as 'exceptional.' Also discovered on Sinwar's body were a stack of letters between him and his 10-year-old son. Their contents, reported in the Israeli media, include personal discussions of family life and radical jihadi rhetoric. The terror leader's son sent his father drawings of dead Israeli soldiers, and Sinwar, in turn, wrote about the need to destroy Israel through armed war.

Senior IDF officer calls for urgent upgrade to combat drones amid...	In Binyamina, a Hezbollah drone struck a dining hall at a Golani brigade training base, killing four and wounding 60. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A senior IDF official called for an urgent upgrade in short-range aerial defense capabilities following a deadly drone strike last week at a training base in Binyamina. In addition, a Hezbollah drone attempted to strike the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea and hit a nearby building with no alarms heard in the area. 'The Israel Air Force has not built a proper force to deal with drone threats on such a large scale, despite the significant successes in the North,' Walla quoted a senior reserve officer as saying on Thursday. The senior officer described the situation as 'a fundamental issue' and pointed out that in many situations, four fighter helicopters and a missile ship are needed to chase just one drone. 'We knew this, just like the IAF didn't develop its ground support capabilities for the border forces well enough. On the other hand, it developed its long-range fighting capabilities across seven different theaters quite impressively,' he continued. Last week, a Hezbollah drone struck a dining hall in a Golani brigade training base, killing four and wounding 60. A baffling aspect of the incident is that the military tracked the drone, tried to intercept it, and reported it had fallen into the sea when, in reality, it had penetrated layers of defense. Civilians had spotted the drones in the sky, but no warnings and sirens were heard. 'No defense system is completely airtight, even with advanced technologies,' says Dr. Liran Antebi, a senior visiting researcher at the Yuval Ne'eman Workshop at Tel Aviv University and a global expert on drones and UAVs. However, Antebi emphasized the need for Israel's military to expedite the search for solutions for drone and UAV defense given the fact that Israel's enemies are catching up with UAV technology. Antebi said, 'The other side is improvising and achieving capabilities that were once exclusive to official nations, integrating them in ways that challenge our defense systems.' Antebi recommended, 'I would strengthen the country's protection and establish protocols for more immediate and frequent defense drills at all bases, as they are the main focus of the threat. We've seen firsthand what happens in these situations.'

Israel drops leaflets in Gaza with images of Sinwar’s body that s...	The flyers said,'Whoever drops the weapon and hands over the hostages will be allowed to leave and live in peace.' By Reuters and Algemeiner Staff Israeli planes dropped leaflets over southern Gaza on Saturday showing a picture of the dead Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar with the message that 'Hamas will no longer rule Gaza,' echoing language used by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The move came as Israeli military strikes killed at least 32 people across the Gaza Strip and tightened a siege around hospitals in Jabalia in the north of the enclave, Palestinian health officials said. 'Whoever drops the weapon and hands over the hostages will be allowed to leave and live in peace,' the leaflet, written in Arabic, read, according to residents of the southern city of Khan Younis and images circulating online. The leaflet’s wording was from a statement by Netanyahu on Thursday after Sinwar was killed by Israeli soldiers operating in Rafah, in the south near the Egyptian border, on Wednesday. In the central Gaza Strip camp of Al-Maghzai, an Israeli strike on a house killed 11 people, while another strike at the nearby camp of Nuseirat killed four others. Five other people were killed in two separate strikes in the south Gaza cities of Khan Younis and Rafah, medics said, while seven Palestinians were killed in the Shati camp in the northern Gaza Strip. EVACUATION ORDERS Residents and medics said Israeli forces had tightened their siege on Jabalia, the largest of the enclave’s eight historic camps, which it encircled by also sending tanks to nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and issuing evacuation orders to residents. Israeli officials said evacuation orders were aimed at separating Hamas fighters from civilians and denied that there was any systematic plan to clear civilians out of Jabalia or other northern areas.

Hezbollah drone hits building near Netanyahu’s home; no injuries ...	The Prime Minister and his wife were not home when the incident occurred. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Saturday, a Hezbollah drone targeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home in Caesarea. Although a nearby building was struck, there were no reported injuries. The Prime Minister and his wife were not home when the incident occurred. An announcement from the Prime Minister's office stated that 'a building had been hit' in the central coastal town known for its Roman ruins and amphitheater. Netanyahu released a statement on Saturday evening, 'The agents of Iran who tried to assassinate me and my wife today made a bitter mistake.' He remained firm that attempts on his life would not deter him from continuing to execute the war and added that anyone who harms Israelis 'will pay a heavy price.' 'We will continue to eliminate your terrorists, we will return our hostages from Gaza, we will return our residents in the north,' he continued. There is no indication if the Prime Minister's residence was damaged in the attack. Three drones were targeted at the home, and two of the three were shot down, with a third hitting a nearby building. Axios reports that this is the first time since the beginning of the war 'that a target affiliated directly with Netanyahu has been hit.' Israel's military is investigating several problems with its warning system since there were no alarms sounded in Caesarea prior to the drone making impact. Although attack helicopters were close to the scene, they were searching for drones further north. There were sirens heard in Glilot north of Tel Aviv, the location of a major IDF intelligence base and the Mossad headquarters, but there were no alerts on the Home Front Command app or similar platforms. The presence of the drones and the interceptions triggered alarms across central Israel's coast on Saturday. A resident of Caesarea told Channel 12 he heard helicopters and was worried that there was an incident, but since there were no sirens, he was not worried at first. He continued, 'Suddenly, a large explosion was heard, and it was not clear to us if it was from an interception or a drone impact — but it was clear that it was a real incident with no prior warning.' 'It was very worrying; luckily, there are no casualties,' he said.

Gaza-based CBS producer asks, ‘Are Jews human?’	Marwan Al-Ghoul has 'liked' various comments on social media that refer to Jews as 'Nazis' and 'murderers.' By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner A Gaza-based producer for CBS News praised by higher-ups for his 'resolve' has a history of denigrating Israel on social media, calling into question the publication’s potential bias against the Jewish state amid uproar over recent treatment of Jewish anchor Tony Dokoupil. According to social media posts unearthed by the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting & Analysis (CAMERA), Marwan Al-Ghoul has 'liked' various comments on social media that refer to Jews as 'Nazis' and 'murderers.' He has also penned lengthy screeds on social media which gush about the potential 'demise' of the United States and Europe. In 2022, Al-Ghoul 'liked' a Facebook comment claiming Israeli Jews 'are Nazi Zionist murderers whose crimes are silenced, covered for by the US and international complicity. The date of holding them accountable will reach them one day and our children do not forget.' That same year, the CBS News producer 'liked' a Facebook comment about Israeli Jews that read, 'By no means do they count as human, these are monsters in a human body.' In 2017, as Hamas fired rockets at Israel in response to the US recognizing Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, Al-Ghoul wrote that Gaza’s civilians should join the 'permanent resistance' against the Jewish state. In 2018, he wrote that 'there is no doubt that the United States of America is the greatest empire in the world and because Israel is its offspring and industry, it will not be able to breathe even one day if the American empire is gone. And because it is the year of God in his creation, America and Israel are about to go down, but when?' In May 2022, Al-Ghoul openly questioned, 'Are the Jews human like us?' CBS has recently received criticism over its treatment of Jewish anchor Tony Dokoupil, arguing that his tough on-air questions directed at Ta-Nehisi Coates regarding his new book, The Message, were biased and did not meet 'editorial standards.' Dokoupil directly challenged Coates’s assertions that the Jewish state was practicing 'apartheid' against Palestinians and claimed the writer excluded important context about Israel’s security concerns. Dokoupil’s pointed questioning of Coates drew outrage from CBS News staffers and the broader media landscape. Staffers demanded that the CBS brass punish Dokoupil for his supposedly 'biased' line of questioning against Coates. Dokoupil was subsequently dragged into a meeting with the outlet’s 'Race and Culture Unit' in which he was criticized for his tone, phrasing, and body language. With a brighter spotlight now on CBS over its coverage of Israel, Al-Ghoul’s previous social media commentary may call into question the accuracy and fairness of his work. Many journalists from the Palestinian territories have previously exhibited a consistent anti-Israel bias in their reporting, even parroting narratives from the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. According to a Jewish Insider report from earlier this year, one-third of the Palestinian journalists listed by the Committee to Protect Journalists as being killed in the war in Gaza were connected to terrorist groups. There is no evidence that Al-Ghoul has any such connection.

Iran’s UN Mission claims Sinwar ‘will become a model for youth in...	Sinwar spent much of the war hiding in Gaza tunnels and surrounded himself with hostages as human shields to protect himself against Israeli forces. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Following the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar on Saturday, the Iranian mission to the UN released a statement that the October 7th mastermind 'will become a role model for the youth and children who will follow his path towards the liberation of Palestine.' The statement continued, 'As long as occupation and aggression exist, resistance will endure, for the martyr remains alive and a source of inspiration.' On X, the Iranian mission said Sinwar was superior to Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, who was executed in 2006. They wrote,' When U.S. forces dragged a disheveled Saddam Hussein out of an underground hole, he begged them not to kill him despite being armed. Those who regarded Saddam as their model of resistance eventually collapsed.' The Iranian mission continued, 'However when Muslims look up to Martyr Sinwar standing on the battlefield—in combat attire and out in the open, not in a hideout, facing the enemy—the spirit of resistance will be strengthened.' Contrary to the UN mission's statement, Sinwar spent much of the war hiding in Gaza tunnels and surrounded himself with hostages as human shields to protect himself against Israeli forces. Channel 12 reported that Sinwar had been hiding with the six hostages who were executed and then recovered by the IDF on Aug. 31. The hostages were identified as Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, Eden Yerushalmi, 24, Almog Sarusi, 25, Alexander Lobanov, 32, Carmel Gat, 40, and Master Sgt. Ori Danino, 25. However, when Israeli troops killed Sinwar on Saturday, he was not surrounded by hostages but was reportedly in the process of fleeing to the north of Gaza. In a speech on Saturday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Gazans to reject Hamas and emphasized Sinwar's cowardice as he was fleeing potential assassination. Netanyahu said, 'Sinwar destroyed your lives. He told you he was a lion, but in practice, he hid in a dark tunnel and was eliminated when he fled in a panic from our soldiers.' Netanyahu continued, 'His elimination is an important milestone in the demise of the Hamas axis of evil.' Daniel Hagari, the IDF's spokesman, said his forces 'didn't know he was there, but we continued to operate.' The troops saw one Hamas terrorist who 'ran alone into one of the buildings.' A drone was sent into the building and showed Sinwar mortally wounded, sitting slumped forward in his chair and throwing a stick at the drone as a last-ditch effort to defend himself. He was reportedly identified by his teeth. Official confirmation will follow DNA identification.

2 wounded in Dead Sea terror attack	Terrorists wearing army uniform infiltrate into Israel from Jordan, open fire on Israelis near the Dead Sea, wounding at least two. By World Israel News Staff At least two people were wounded when terrorists opened fire near an Israeli moshav in the Dead Sea area Friday morning. Two terrorists opened fire in the Tamar Regional Council district south of the Dead Sea, less than two miles from the town of Neot HaKikar. Neot HaKikar's emergency response team opened fire on the terrorists, killing both of them. According to a preliminary investigation by the Israeli military, the terrorists were wearing army uniforms, and had infiltrated into Israel across the Jordanian border. The IDF has dispatched soldiers to the area and has launched searches of the vicinity for any other terrorists who may have infiltrated across the border, the army said. 'A short while ago, IDF soldiers identified a number of terrorists that crossed from Jordan into Israeli territory south of the Dead Sea,' an army spokesperson said Friday morning. 'IDF troops were dispatched to the scene and two terrorists who opened fire toward the troops were neutralized by the forces. The troops are conducting searches in the area.' 'Additional forces have been dispatched to reinforce the area and are conducting searches on the ground and air for an additional terrorist who likely fled the scene.' Emergency first responders were called to the scene to treat the wounded and evacuate them to a hospital. One of the victims is listed in moderate condition, the other in light condition.

Terror attack on Tel Aviv hostage protest thwarted	Jerusalem resident tied to Hamas planned shooting and bombing attacks, including on targeting Tel Aviv demonstrators demanding deal to secure release of hostages in Gaza. By World Israel News Staff A Hamas-aligned terrorist from eastern Jerusalem planned a series of shooting and bombing attacks, including on targeting Tel Aviv protesters demanding a hostage deal, Israel Police announced Friday. The terrorist, a 22-year-old Arab resident of the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, was arrested a month ago, as part of an investigation into his various terror plots, police said. According to police, the Shin Bet internal security agency initiated the investigation last month. The suspect drafted plans for a number of possible attacks, including one on a Tel Aviv hostage protest, along with plots to shoot IDF soldiers, and plans to plant bombs on a train in Tel Aviv. The terrorist's self-stated goal was 'To kill as many people as possible to avenge the people of Gaza and the terror group Hamas.' As part of his preparations, the terrorist wrote a will and opened a social media group called the 'Soldiers of God.' At the time of his arrest, the terrorist was preparing for his first attack - aimed at the weekly hostage protest in Tel Aviv. Other terrorist operatives in Judea and Samaria were slated to obtain firearms and bombs for the planned attacks, police said. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit) lauded the officers responsible for the terrorist's arrest, and called on the Knesset to pass a pair of bills which would make it easier to deport the families of convicted terrorists and to execute terrorists found guilty of murder. 'I commend and praise the commanders and officers of the Jerusalem District [police] for thwarting the terrorist attack planned by a terrorist resident of east Jerusalem,' said Ben-Gvir. 'Along with the fighting in Lebanon and Gaza, we keep a close watch on terrorists within our midst. The Israel Police invest great efforts to prevent them in advance.' 'The Otzma Yehudit party will continue to fight terrorism with full force and enact laws such as the Deportation of Terrorists' Families Law, the Death Penalty for Terrorists Law, and other deterrence laws, until we eradicate and uproot terrorism from within.'

Who was Yahya Sinwar?	Best known as the chief of Hamas forces in Gaza and mastermind of the October 7th invasion, Yahya Sinwar was arguably the Islamist terror group's most radical leader. By Baruch Yedid, TPS Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who masterminded the October 7 attacks was killed in a chance encounter with Israeli soldiers in Rafah on Thursday. Born in 1962 in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in Gaza, Sinwar grew up in a family that originated from Al Majdal, near Ashkelon. He rose to prominence within Hamas from the group’s early days, co-founding its Majd unit, which targeted suspected collaborators with Israel. Throughout his life, Sinwar was arrested multiple times and ultimately sentenced to five life terms for killing 12 Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel. During his imprisonment, Israeli doctors removed a tumor from Sinwar’s brain in 2007, saving his life. Sinwar’s fortunes changed in 2011 when he was among 1,027 security prisoners freed in the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange. In the following years, his influence in Hamas grew. He traveled to Iran to meet with Qassem Soleimani of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, who coordinated the IRGC’s relationships with Iranian proxy terror groups. Sinwar, along with Salah Arouri were instrumental in bringing Hamas into Iran’s orbit. By 2017, Sinwar became Hamas’s leader in Gaza. Reports suggest that his decision-making was driven by concerns over Israel’s work on developing a laser-based air defense system. On October 7, 2023, Hamas attacked numerous Israeli communities near the Gaza border. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage. But if Sinwar expected a wider war with the direct involvement of Iran’s other proxy terror groups, he was disappointed. Hezbollah began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities on a daily basis, but never invaded the Galilee. Houthis attacked international shipping in the Red Sea, while numerous ballistic missiles and drones caused minimal damage. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, and Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah was killed in a Beirut airstrike. And Iranian missile barrages in April and October failed to cause significant damage to Israel. Israel made repeated attempts to target Sinwar. After a prisoner exchange in November, Sinwar rejected further negotiations unless Israeli guaranteed an end to the war. Although he became Hamas supreme leader after Haniyeh’s death, he clashed with Hamas’s Qatar-based international leadership, barring them from engaging in any activities concerning Gaza’s post-war future, including talks with the Palestinian Authority. With Israel’s elimination of other Hamas leaders in the past year, Sinwar’s brother Mohammed, is now viewed as the only senior Hamas figure leader remaining in Gaza.

Israel bolstering border security on Syrian frontier	IDF troops are clearing land mines and establishing new barriers in the frontier region. By JNS Israeli forces have accelerated work on enhancing defensive measures near the Syrian border in the Golan Heights in recent weeks, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing security sources and analysts. Troops have cleared land mines and established new barriers on the frontier between the area in the far northeast of Israel and the demilitarized strip bordering Syria, according to the report. The move suggests Jerusalem could be looking to hit Hezbollah for the first time further east along its border with Lebanon, while establishing a secure zone from which IDF soldiers can monitor the Iranian-backed terrorist army and prevent infiltration into Israel, sources told the news agency. The work at the Syrian border could also represent a bolstering of Israeli actions to prevent weapons-smuggling from Iran to Hezbollah via Syrian territory. Reuters, citing a Syrian soldier stationed in south Syria, a Lebanese security official and a U.N. peacekeeping official, revealed that in addition to the previously reported demining activities, Israel was 'moving the fence separating the DMZ [demilitarized zone] towards the Syrian side and digging more fortifications in the area.' The sources said that Israeli tanks had at times briefly entered Syrian territory east of the U.N.-monitored buffer zone to provide security for bulldozers setting up what appears to be a new security fence in the demilitarized area. The Syrian soldier said it appeared that Israel was establishing a 'buffer zone' in the demilitarized area. A second Lebanese security source said that Israel dug a trench near the DMZ in October. This increased activity at the Syria-Golan border zone began in early October, around the same time that an Israeli ground operation to root out Hezbollah terrorism in Southern Lebanon began. Israel has also ramped up its alleged strikes on Syria during this period, according to the report. Reuters also reported that Russian troops left the Tal Hara outpost, a strategic overlook point. 'The Russians had left because of understandings with the Israelis to prevent a clash, a Syrian military officer said,' according to the article. A Syrian army officer said on Tuesday morning that Syrian army commanders ordered Syrian paramilitary groups to withdraw from the southern Quneitra area within 24 hours. Two sources also said that Iraqi militias backed by Iran had also been ordered to move away from the Quneitra countryside after Israeli tanks were spotted in the zone. The Iraqi fighters were told not to engage with Israeli forces directly. Israel’s military said it 'does not comment on operational plans' and it 'is currently fighting against the terrorist organization Hezbollah in order to allow for the safe return of northern residents to their homes,' in response to a Reuters question about the demining operation.

Former KKK leader David Duke endorses Jill Stein for president	Citing her opposition to Israel, ex-KKK grand wizard David Duke endorses the far-left Green Party's Jewish candidate, Jill Stein, for president. By Jackie Hajdenberg, JTA David Duke, the former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, endorsed Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, who is Jewish, on his radio show Tuesday. Duke, long one of the country’s highest-profile white supremacists and antisemites, has repeatedly sought political office while spreading conspiracy theories about Jews. In his endorsement of Stein, he said that she was the candidate with the strongest stance against 'Jewish power' because she opposed Israel’s military campaign. 'Although Dr. Stein and I obviously have our differences on important issues, she’s the only candidate who speaks clearly against the war in the Middle East and Ukraine,' Duke said on his radio show. 'By opposing Jewish supremacy in Israel and Jewish mass murder in Israel, and the policies of the American government in these insane wars and the Ukrainian war there, she’s actually doing something which is harming this Jewish power.' Duke is an unlikely supporter of Stein, who in addition to being Jewish is a far-left candidate. Duke, a fixture of the far-right, previously endorsed Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020. On his show, Duke claimed that Trump had since lost his support due to a 'full-throated subservience to Israel and to the Jewish lobby in the United States' and 'on a global level.' But in endorsing Stein, Duke is still backing a candidate who could help return Trump to the White House. Stein’s bid for president is widely viewed as having a potential spoiler effect on the Harris-Walz campaign, taking enough votes away from the Democratic ticket in crucial swing states to throw them to the Republican nominee. At a recent rally, a Stein surrogate said the ticket couldn’t win, but could 'deny Kamala Harris the state of Michigan.' Stein’s campaign immediately disavowed the endorsement, which it painted as insincere. 'A racist troll has ‘endorsed’ our campaign to draw attention to himself, and certain smear merchants are happy to platform this troll to attack us,' Stein said in a statement. 'Of course, I reject any ‘endorsement’ from a white supremacist like David Duke, unlike Kamala Harris who can’t stop bragging about her endorsement from white supremacist mass murderer Dick Cheney.' (Cheney, Republican George W. Bush’s vice president, announced last month that he would vote for Harris because he believed Trump 'can never be trusted with power again.' Stein contends that the Bush administration’s war in Iraq amounted to mass murder.) Duke has made repeated political forays of his own over the decades, at certain points drawing national attention. He is a former member of the Louisiana House of Representatives, campaigned for U.S. president as a Democrat in 1988, and advanced to the runoff in the 1991 election for governor of Louisiana, which he lost by a wide margin. He has since mounted other unsuccessful runs for office. And this is not the first time Duke has endorsed or praised a Democrat while citing their antipathy toward Jews or Israel. In 2019, he praised Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar amid controversy over tweets she wrote that drew accusations of antisemitism and for which she apologized. Weeks earlier, he endorsed then-Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, saying she would 'actually put America First rather than Israel First!' Whether or not Duke actually has enough of a following to sway any voters to Stein, supporters of Harris are using the endorsement to attack the Green Party candidate. 'Just because you disavow KKK grand wizard David Duke’s endorsement doesn’t mean it’s not concerning and you didn’t earn it,' tweeted Keith Edwards, a Democratic campaign strategist.

Netanyahu to Gazans after Sinwar’s Death: ‘Lay down your arms and...	Netanyahu to critics of Israel:'This is why we insisted on entering &#8230; Rafah where Sinwar and many of the murderers hid.' By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, following the news of the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar on Saturday, urged Gazan civilians to abandon Hamas, put down their arms and release hostages. He said that any Gazans holding hostages will be spared if they lay down their weapons and release captives. 'And at the same time I say, whoever harms our hostages, his blood will be on his head,' said Netanyahu. ' We will come to a reckoning with him.' He added, 'Sinwar destroyed your lives. He told you he was a lion, but in practice, he hid in a dark tunnel and was eliminated when he fled in a panic from our soldiers.' Netanyahu continued, 'His elimination is an important milestone in the demise of the Hamas axis of evil.' 'Hamas will no longer rule Gaza,' Netanyahu explained. 'This is the beginning of the day after Hamas, and this is an opportunity for you, the residents of Gaza, to finally break free from its tyranny.' 'To the Hamas terrorists I say: your leaders are fleeing and they will be eliminated.' Netanyahu said. Addressing families of hostages, Netanyahu said, 'This is an important moment in the war. We will continue with full force until all your loved ones — our loved ones — are returned home. That is our supreme obligation. That is my supreme obligation.' To critics of Israel's military policies, Netanyahu said this is 'why we insisted, in the face of all the pressures, to enter Rafah, the fortified stronghold of Hamas where Sinwar and many of the murderers hid.'

Sinwar’s death highlights the futility ceasefire concessions	Ceasefire periods allowed Hamas to rebuild infrastructure, enhance arsenals, and plan future attacks, prolonging the conflict and escalating the threat. By Gregg Roman, Middle East Forum The death of Yahya Sinwar, mastermind of the October 7, 2023, massacre and head of Hamas’s political bureau, marks a turning point in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israeli forces eliminated Sinwar, who had orchestrated Hamas’s insurgency in Gaza since his 2011 release from prison during the Gilad Shalit prisoner swap. Sinwar’s removal disrupts Hamas’s leadership and raises critical questions about the effectiveness of past ceasefire demands and concessions. Ceasefires aim to halt violence and open paths to dialogue. Yet militant groups like Hamas have exploited these pauses to regroup, rearm, and strengthen their positions. Sinwar’s rise exemplified how concessions can empower those committed to violence. Ceasefire periods allowed Hamas to rebuild infrastructure, enhance arsenals, and plan future attacks, prolonging the conflict and escalating the threat. Reliance on ceasefires without dismantling the foundations of militancy creates a false sense of security. These temporary measures offer immediate relief but fail to produce lasting peace. Sinwar’s resurgence after 2011 underscores the risks associated with ceasefires lacking stringent enforcement and verification. They interfere with strategic objectives like dismantling terrorist networks by granting groups time and space to recover and prepare for further aggression. The elimination of Sinwar mirrors the fates of other high-profile militant leaders. The deaths of figures like Al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden, Iraq’s insurgent leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin, and master bombmaker Yahya Ayyash disrupted their organizations but did not end the threats they posed. Bin Laden’s death dealt a blow to Al-Qaeda but led to decentralization and the rise of new factions. Yassin’s assassination led to short-term escalations before weakening Hamas’s leadership structure. These cases show that removing key leaders must be part of a broader strategy addressing the ideological and operational foundations of these groups. Targeted killings alone can lead to unintended consequences, such as the emergence of more radical elements or the continuation of violence. Sinwar once quoted Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (r. 632-661 CE): 'There are two days in human life, a day when death is not your destiny, and a day when death is your destiny. I am not afraid of the first day because death is not my destiny, so no one can harm me. I am not afraid of the second day either, because if it is my destiny, I cannot prevent it.' His fatalistic confidence proved misplaced. Decisive action can reach even those who consider themselves untouchable. Sinwar’s death calls for a critical reassessment of repeated ceasefire demands. Ceasefires should not be ends in themselves but tools managed carefully to prevent exploitation by militant groups. The tactical advantages gained during ceasefires—regrouping, rearming, and spreading ideology—undermine long-term peace efforts. Engaging in ceasefires can inadvertently legitimize these groups as political actors, eroding public trust in governmental strategies. Ensuring compliance from decentralized militant organizations is challenging, leading to breaches that reignite hostilities. The current moment offers an opportunity to rethink conflict approaches. A comprehensive strategy should combine sustained security measures with diplomatic efforts addressing the political, economic, and social factors fueling militancy. Preventing tactical exploitation requires robust monitoring and enforcement during any ceasefire. Avoiding actions that legitimize terrorist organizations while promoting legitimate political processes is essential. Transparent communication about security measures’ goals and outcomes can maintain public trust. International collaboration is vital to apply consistent pressure on militant groups and support initiatives addressing the conflict’s root causes. Ultimately, ending an organization like Hamas requires decapitating its leadership, not negotiating with those who orchestrate massacres. Convincing the rank-and-file that their war goals are unattainable leads them to consider surrender or disarmament. Sinwar’s fate demonstrates that decisive action can overcome fatalistic beliefs and disrupt militant operations. Continuing to rely on ceasefires without achieving core objectives only prolongs the cycle of violence. Perhaps it is time to acknowledge that ceasefires, when they enable enemies to regroup rather than secure peace, are not just ineffective—they are a dangerous illusion that delay victory and cost lives.

Israeli sources: Hamas chief and Oct 7th mastermind, Yahya Sinwar...	The Israel Police positively identified the corpse of Sinwar, who was killed on Wednesday. By Charles Bybelezer, Amelie Botbol, JNS IDF soldiers killed Hamas terror master Yahya Sinwar in a firefight in the southern Gazan city of Rafah, Israeli sources close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters on Thursday. The Israel Police positively identified the corpse of Sinwar, who was killed on Wednesday, several channels and news sites subsequently reported. He was reportedly identified by his teeth. Official confirmation will follow DNA identification. Reuters cited Hamas sources as saying that all indications suggest the terror master had been killed. Netanyahu was set to address the nation at 8:30 p.m. local time. Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar holds the son of an Al-Qassam Brigades terrorist who was killed in recent fighting with Israel, during a rally in Gaza City, May 24, 2021.

The Israel Defense Forces said earlier Thursday that it was investigating whether Sinwar was one of three terrorists killed by Israeli soldiers in the Palestinian enclave. According to initial reports, the Hamas leader was killed by tank fire called in by IDF soldiers who had identified armed terrorists in a building. When the soldiers subsequently searched the premises, they discovered that one of the bodies bore a striking resemblance to Sinwar. 'We will reach every terrorist and eliminate them,' Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant tweeted on Thursday. 'You will pursue your enemies, and they will fall before you by the sword,' added Gallant, quoting Leviticus 26:7. The X post included pictures of former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was assassinated in an IDF strike in Beirut last month, and former Hamas 'military'/Al-Qassam Brigades chief Mohammed Deif, who was killed in an Israeli strike in southern Gaza’s Khan Yunis in July. Later on Thursday, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) head Ronen Bar held a situation assessment. Shin Bet head Ronen Bar (left) and IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi hold a situation assessment, Oct. 17, 2024. Credit: Israel Defense Forces. The military said on Thursday that while no hostages were found in the building where the three terrorists were killed, 'forces continue to operate with the necessary caution in the area.' Netanyahu instructed the IDF to inform hostage families that there was no indication any hostages were hurt during the battle. Efrat Machikawa, the niece of captive Gadi Moses, told JNS on Thursday, 'I hope all Israelis including the government will remain modest and humble. While this is a military achievement, the most important thing remains saving lives, and by that I mean returning the hostages.' While the Hamas leader’s elimination is 'very important, I remain extremely concerned about [the hostages’] fate. They are in my head and my heart every second since Oct. 7. They are the only ones I think about,' Machikawa added. Opposition leader Yair Lapid called on the Netanyahu government to 'take advantage of the opportunity for a decisive move regarding the hostages. 'Strive for a comprehensive deal and offer monetary rewards and safe passage to anyone who brings captives to our forces,' he tweeted. Qatari officials involved in indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas have told family members of hostages that Sinwar had surrounded himself with captives. Channel 12 reported that Sinwar had been hiding with the six hostages who were executed and then recovered by the IDF on Aug. 31. The hostages were identified as Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, Eden Yerushalmi, 24, Almog Sarusi, 25, Alexander Lobanov, 32, Carmel Gat, 40, and Master Sgt. Ori Danino, 25. Hamas still holds 101 hostages, including 97 of the 251 taken during the Palestinian terror group’s massacre of some 1,200 people in the northwestern Negev just over a year ago. 'We need to thank the IDF if Sinwar is indeed dead. It also means that there is a lot of anxiety regarding the fate of the 101 hostages,' Ruby Chen, the father of captive Itay Chen, told JNS on Thursday. 'Now is the time to leverage this military action for a deal to get them out. 'We received an update from IDF sources confirming that there were no hostages in the vicinity with regards to the incident,' he continued. 'My message is that now is the time to get a deal done and put an end to all of this.'

Earlier this month, Sinwar reportedly renewed contacts with mediators in Qatar to find out the chances that he could receive immunity in any ceasefire-for-hostages-and-terrorists-release deal. Similarly, in August, Ynet reported that Sinwar wanted protection against the possibility of an Israeli assassination. 'Sinwar insists on guarantees for his safety and life' a senior Egyptian official said. Two threats from Qatar led to Sinwar’s emergence from a long silence, according to Channel 12. Sinwar was convicted on multiple murder counts by an Israeli court and sentenced to five life sentences, which he was supposed to serve until his death. However, in October 2011, he was released from prison—having served 22 years—as part of the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange. Following his release, Sinwar gained power and popularity within Hamas, becoming its Gaza leader in 2017 by defeating Ismail Haniyeh in a vote. In August, Sinwar was chosen to lead Hamas’s so-called political bureau, replacing Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Tehran on July 31.

IDF blows up Hezbollah command center close to northern Israeli t...	The IDF found the largest storehouse of weapons and ammunition discovered so far in Lebanon. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Wednesday, Alexandroni Brigade's Battalion 7012 troops blew up a Hezbollah central operations command center across from the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona. In addition to discovering complex underground terror infrastructure, the IDF found the largest storehouse of weapons and ammunition discovered so far in Lebanon. The Hezbollah command center was located in the village of Muhajbib ,which is across from the Ramim Ridge and Kiryat Shmona, which been a consistent target of Hezbollah missile attacks. The IDF found numerous shafts leading into the underground infrastructure containing command, planning, and communications rooms. In addition, they seized dozens of Claymore mines that were ready for use, hundreds of hand grenades, shoulder-fired and anti-tank missiles, hundreds of RPG grenades, an equal number of anti-tank mines, and ammunition. During the operation, Battalion 7012 fought and eliminated dozens of terrorists above and below ground. At the completion of the mission, they blew up the command center to render it completely unusable. The Israel Air Force struck a Hezbollah position in Lebanon's capital city Wednesday morning, marking the first time in six days the IDF has bombed targets in Beirut. The strike, which involved multiple IAF fighter jets, hit an underground weapons cache used by Hezbollah in Beirut's Dahieh neighborhood, a heavily Shi'ite enclave in the Lebanese capital where Hezbollah headquarters are located. Israel warned civilians in the environs of the underground weapons storage facility, the IDF said, in an attempt to minimize collateral damage. 'You are located near facilities and interests belonging to Hezbollah, and the IDF will work against them in the near future,' IDF spokesman Avichay Adraee tweeted in Arabic before the strike. 'For your safety and the safety of your family members, you must evacuate this building.' The tweet included a map highlighting the building under which the underground weapons cache was located.

Macron to Netanyahu: ‘Don’t forget, the UN made Israel’	Netanyahu and Macron spar over French demand that Israel reach ceasefire with Hezbollah and Israel's call for UN peacekeepers to evacuate from southern Lebanon. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel's prime minister and France's president sparred Tuesday over the ongoing war between Israel and Hezbollah, as well as the United Nation's role in establishing the Jewish state. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by phone with French President Emmanuel Macron, rebuffing the latter's demand that Israel agree to a unilateral ceasefire in Lebanon. According to a statement released by the Prime Minister's Office, Netanyahu told Macron that such a move 'would not change the security situation in Lebanon and would return the country to its previous state.' Netanyahu also expressed dismay at Macron's plans to host a summit in Paris on the war between Israel and Hezbollah, inviting leaders from countries including South Africa and Algeria. The South African government has accused Israel of genocide in a petition to the International Court of Justice, with Algeria seconding the motion. Also on Tuesday, Macron chided Netanyahu, telling cabinet ministers the Israeli leader must respect United Nations decisions, and not pressure the United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon (UNIFIL) to evacuate from southern Lebanon. 'Mr. Netanyahu must not forget that his country was created by a decision of the UN,' Macron was quoted as saying by a participant in the meeting who spoke with AFP. 'Therefore this is not the time to disregard the decisions of the UN.' Israel declared its independence on May 14th, 1948, as the British Mandate for Palestine, established by the League of Nations after World War II, lapsed. A non-binding resolution passed by the UN General Assembly on November 29th, 1947 - UN Resolution 181 - recommended the partition of the Mandate into a Jewish state, an Arab state, and an international zone under UN custodianship. While the leadership of the Jewish Agency for Palestine gave qualified support for the plan, it was rejected by the Mandate's Arab Higher Committee and the Arab League, and was never adopted. Netanyahu rebutted Macron's comments in a statement issued Tuesday, noting that Israel was not established by the non-binding UN resolution. 'A reminder to the French President: It was not a UN decision that established the State of Israel but the victory that was achieved in the War of Independence with the blood of our heroic fighters, many of whom were Holocaust survivors, including from the Vichy regime in France.' 'It would also be worthwhile to recall that in recent decades, the UN has approved hundreds of antisemitic decisions against the State of Israel, the purpose of which is to deny the one and only Jewish state's right to exist and its ability to defend itself.'

After six-day pause, IDF bombs Hezbollah targets in Beirut	Israel Air Force strikes Hezbollah weapons cache in Beirut neighborhood of Dahieh, after reports claiming Netanyahu had pledged to Biden to drastically reduce strikes in the Lebanese capital. By World Israel News Staff The Israel Air Force struck a Hezbollah position in Lebanon's capital city Wednesday morning, marking the first time in six days the IDF has bombed targets in Beirut. The strike, which involved multiple IAF fighter jets, hit an underground weapons cache used by Hezbollah in Beirut's Dahieh neighborhood; a heavily Shi'ite enclave in the Lebanese capital where Hezbollah headquarters are located. Israel warned civilians in the environs of the underground weapons storage facility, the IDF said, in an attempt to minimize collateral damage. 'You are located near facilities and interests belonging to Hezbollah, and the IDF will work against them in the near future,' IDF spokesman Avichay Adraee tweeted in Arabic before the strike. 'For your safety and the safety of your family members, you must evacuate this building.' The tweet included a map highlighting the building under which the underground weapons cache was located. In addition, roughly a dozen airstrikes were reported in the Nabatieh district of southern Lebanon Wednesday morning. Israel's last airstrike in Beirut was carried out last Thursday, after which, the IDF was reportedly instructed to refrain from carrying out attacks in the Lebanese capital city. According to a report Monday night by Kan 11, the IDF received written instructions Friday morning not to carry out further strikes inside Beirut. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to deny claims that he had imposed restrictions on IDF action in Beirut, saying Monday that the IDF will 'continue to strike Hezbollah without mercy everywhere in Lebanon, including Beirut,' on Tuesday, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the U.S. had guaranteed him that Israel would drastically curb strikes in Beirut. Yedioth Aharanoth reported that Netanyahu had agreed to President Joe Biden's demand during a telephone conversation last Wednesday to take whatever measures possible to reduce civilian casualties in Lebanon in general and Beirut in particular, and to limit the number of airstrikes in the Beirut metropolitan area.

US warns Iran any attempt on Trump’s life would be an act of war	The White House said the United States has been closely tracking Iranian threats against Trump for years, and it warned of 'severe consequences' if Tehran were to attack any US citizen. By Reuters and The Algemeiner The United States has warned the Iranian government to stop all plotting against Republican Donald Trump and said that Washington would view any attempt on his life as an act of war, a US official said on Monday. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said US President Joe Biden has been briefed regularly on the threats and directed his team to address Iranian plots against Americans. At Biden’s direction, top US officials have sent messages to the highest levels of the Iranian government warning Tehran to cease all plotting against Trump and former US officials, the official said. The Iranians have been told that Washington would view it as an act of war if any attempt was carried out against Trump‘s life, the official said. Iran has denied interfering in US affairs. Tehran, in turn, says Washington has interfered in its affairs for decades, citing events ranging from a 1953 coup against a prime minister to the 2020 killing of its military commander in a US drone strike. In January 2020, Trump ordered a US air strike that killed Iran‘s then-top military commander, Qassem Soleimani, who was responsible for overseeing the regime’s terrorist proxies abroad, after receiving intelligence that Soleimani was planning imminent attacks on US diplomats and armed forces in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and elsewhere in the Middle East. Trump, a Republican, is now seeking a return to the White House after losing the 2020 election to Biden. Trump is now in a battle against Vice President Kamala Harris in the race for the Nov. 5 election. His campaign said on Sept. 24 that Trump was briefed by US intelligence officials on the alleged threat from Iran. The White House said the United States has been closely tracking Iranian threats against Trump for years and it warned of 'severe consequences' if Tehran was to attack any US citizen. 'We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority, and we strongly condemn Iran for these brazen threats. Should Iran attack any of our citizens, including those who continue to serve the United States or those who formerly served, Iran will face severe consequences,' said White House National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett. He said 'appropriate agencies are continuously and promptly providing the former president’s security detail with evolving threat information.' 'Additionally, President Biden has reiterated his directive that the United States Secret Service should receive every resource, capability, and protective measure required to address those evolving threats to the former president,' Savett said.

Biden has ‘total distrust’ of Netanyahu’s inner circle, called hi...	Senior Biden aides quoted as saying the president denigrated Netanyahu's associates, calling them 'liars.' By World Israel News Staff President Joe Biden has expressed contempt not only for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but also the Israeli premier's close associates, calling them 'liars,' according to journalist Bob Woodward, following the publication of his new book. On Tuesday, Bob Woodward's latest book, 'War', was released, days after excerpts were published, revealing claims that Biden had repeatedly denigrated Netanyahu. During a phone call with the Israeli leader in July after the IDF bombed a Hezbollah base in Beirut, killing a number of senior terrorists, the president is quoted as shouting 'Bibi, what the f***?' 'You know the perception of Israel around the world increasingly is that you’re a rogue state, a rogue actor.' In private, Biden is quoted as calling Netanyahu a 'son of a bitch' in the spring of 2024, after the IDF entered Rafah. 'Bibi Netanyahu, he’s a bad guy. He’s a bad f***ing guy!' 'He’s a f***ing liar,' Biden was also quoted as saying. But the president did not limit his attacks to Netanyahu, according to Woodward, who discussed Biden's relationship with Netanyahu in an interview with The Washington Post. 'Close aides' cited by Woodward told the journalist that Biden also lambasted the Israeli premier's associates, calling them 'liars,' expressing 'total distrust,' Woodward said. According to the White House aides, Biden said that '18 of the 19 people who work for Netanyahu are liars.' Following a CNN report last week revealing excerpts from the book, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was questioned about Biden’s alleged statements. Jean-Pierre neither denied nor confirmed the claims, downplaying the revelations. 'There’s going to be many books that are written about this administration and many administrations,' Jean-Pierre said. 'Nothing atypical about that.' 'What I can say to that question that you asked me: I cannot confirm. That is not something that I can confirm from here.'

White House confirms letter demanding Israel increase Gaza aid or...	The letter gives Israel 30 days to implement 15 policy changes, including 10 measures to 'surge all forms of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza.' By Andrew Bernard, JNS The White House confirmed the contents of a letter from the Biden administration to the Israeli government demanding that it increase humanitarian aid to Gaza or risk losing access to U.S. military equipment. The letter, dated Oct. 13 and first reported by Axios, is addressed to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. John Kirby, the White House national security communications advisor, told reporters at a briefing on Tuesday that the letter was prompted by a 'recent decrease in humanitarian assistance reaching the people of Gaza.' 'I can confirm that Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken co-signed the letter you’re talking about, and it was sent to their Israeli counterparts,' Kirby said. 'I would note that the Biden-Harris administration made a similar request for concrete measures with respect to humanitarian assistance back in April with a similar letter, and that letter did receive a constructive response from the Israelis.' The Oct. 13 letter references 'important improvements' in humanitarian aid delivery to Gaza after the Biden administration sent the April letter, but notes that since then, humanitarian aid deliveries have declined 50%. It also said that a new channel between the two governments was needed to discuss 'civilian harm incidents' because 'our engagements to date have not produced the necessary outcomes.' It gives Israel 30 days to implement 15 policy changes, including 10 measures to 'surge all forms of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza' or risk losing access to U.S. military materiel. Kirby in his briefing suggested that the letter was not intended as an ultimatum and that it was simply restating U.S. legal requirements for the transfer of arms under the Leahy Laws and U.S. President Joe Biden’s national security memoranda 18 and 20, which describe the conditions under which Washington is allowed to transfer arms to a foreign power. 'The letter was not meant as a threat,' Kirby said. 'The letter just simply restates what we made clear to the Israelis back in April in a similar letter, which is, you know, we have to follow the law of the land here.' 'That’s what you can do with your ally,' Kirby added. 'It’s not the first time we’ve communicated that to Israel, but hopefully we won’t have to communicate it again.' UNIFIL Kirby also discussed Beirut and the United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon in response to questions from reporters. 'The U.N., through UNIFIL, plays an important role, a peacekeeping role in Lebanon and we respect that role. We want everybody to respect that role, including Israel,' he said. 'We’ve told Israel very directly that we oppose their near-daily strikes here in densely-populated areas in Beirut, and we understand that they’re conducting targeted operations that are designed to go after Hezbollah infrastructure, and we recognize that they have a right to do that.' 'But they also have a commensurate responsibility to do it in a way that doesn’t threaten the lives of civilians or U.N. peacekeepers, or, quite frankly, members of the Lebanese armed forces who have suffered some casualties here,' he added. 'It’s unacceptable, and we’ve pressed the Israelis for more details about that.' Kirby added that he is 'in possession of no information that confirms that the U.N. was witting in terms of what Hezbollah infrastructure was nested beneath their buildings. I can’t confirm that particular allegation, but again, I can’t confirm that. But it doesn’t diminish our concerns about the lives and livelihoods of U.N. peacekeepers.' The senior White House adviser told reporters that the Biden administration is not contesting that 'Hezbollah, like Hamas, uses hidden facilities underground for storing arms and ammunition, or for facilitating the freedom of movement of their fighters.' 'There’s no challenge to that allegation,' he said. The White House continues 'to believe that a diplomatic initiative is important to pursue, to bring the conflict to an end, up there in the north as well, and to try to prevent further escalation of the conflict in the region,' he said. 'I don’t want to get into the guts of what that diplomacy is considering, in terms of whose role and how it would be facilitated, just except to say that we continue to support a diplomatic initiative and a diplomatic resolution to this.'

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A Hezbollah terrorist captured by the IDF admitted during interrogation that much of the terror group's leadership, as well as rank and file members, fled when the group's leader of 30 years, Hassan Nasrallah, was assassinated on September 27th. IDF special intelligence Unit 504 revealed on Tuesday night that Wadah Kamal Yunis, who was discovered in a tunnel in southern Lebanon and captured, said of fellow Hezbollah terrorists, 'They all fled&#8230;after the assassination of [Hezbollah chief Hassan] Nasrallah, I did not see any of them.' He added that the Hezbollah Radwan forces also fled and criticized them as 'having little religious principles, people with no religion, who joined to get paid money, and fled because they were afraid of Israeli forces.' The strike in late September that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah required long-term planning and coordination of 'precise intelligence,' according to the IDF. The afternoon operation was carried out by fighter jets that targeted Hezbollah's 'central headquarters,' which were 'embedded under a residential building' in a suburb of Beirut. This area has long been a stronghold of the Lebanese terror group. Nasrallah assumed the leadership of Hezbollah 30 years ago. He was responsible, with the help of Iran, for the growth of the terror group to one of the largest non-state militaries in the region. . In a statement Saturday, Israeli Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said Nasrallah's killing proved that 'anyone who threatens the citizens of Israel — we will know how to reach them.' Brig.-Gen. Amichai Levine, the newly appointed commander of Hatzerim Airbase, said the mission to eliminate Nasrallah required the Israeli Air Force's unique, world-class capabilities. The operation was complex because it required planning, precision, and secrecy to prevent Hezbollah from discovering Israel's plans. 'The operation succeeded perfectly,' Levine said and credited the ground crews and technical teams for the smooth execution. The teams were responsible for ensuring the readiness of the aircraft and managing the munitions. He added, 'About a hundred munitions were used, with bombers dropping them every two seconds in perfect precision.' Levine credited the 69th Squadron, known as the 'Hammers,' which operates F-15I Ra'am fighter jets and has carried out a number of crucial operations in Lebanon and Syria. He added that for the last 11 months, the 69th Squadron's regular and reservist pilots have been on constant alert for missions across the Middle East. Levine said, 'We executed a historic operation of immense strategic importance. Nasrallah is seen as the most central figure in the Shi'ite axis.'

Israel confirms killing senior Hezbollah UAV commander	The announcement did not specify where or when Bahja was killed. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel confirmed on Tuesday it killed a senior Hezbollah UAV commander. The announcement comes as the Israel Defense Forces vowed to eliminate Hezbollah’s Unit 127, which oversees the terror group’s unmanned aerial vehicles. The commander was identified as Khader Al-Abed Bahja, who oversaw the Hezbollah Aerial Unit’s activities north of the Litani River. The announcement did not specify where or when Bahja was killed. 'Under Bahja’s command, numerous aerial attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops were carried out from the area, making use of UAVs, surveillance aircraft, and explosive aircraft,' the IDF said. Israeli military officials said dismantling Unit 127 would become a high priority after four soldiers were killed and nearly 60 injured when a drone struck the dining room of an army base in the central Binyamin region on Sunday night. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, the Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. According to figures released by the government on Sept. 29, more than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, the terror group is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon south of the Litani River.

Biden and Harris teams at each other’s throats as Election Day ap...	Harris and Biden have also made conflicting comments about Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s (R.) response to the recent hurricanes. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon With Election Day just over three weeks away, tensions are rising between Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign team and President Joe Biden’s senior staff, multiple sources told Axios. 'They're too much in their feelings,' one Harris ally said of Biden’s staff, a view echoed by some White House aides. Many of the president’s aides are still hurt by Biden’s forced exit from the race and are struggling to adjust to a supportive role, Axios reported. Harris’s team has complained of the White House’s lack of coordination with the campaign, saying Biden’s team has not involved campaign aides in decisions that could affect the vice president. Harris's team also accused Biden’s aides of not adequately coordinating his messaging and schedule to align with what is best for his vice president's campaign. 'The White House is lacking someone in the room thinking first and foremost about how things would affect the campaign,' one person involved with Harris's campaign told Axios. Biden gave a surprise press conference in the White House briefing room this month just as Harris was about to rally in Michigan, causing her event to get less television coverage. Harris and Biden have also made conflicting comments about Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s (R.) response to the recent hurricanes. Harris criticized DeSantis for not taking her call, saying he is 'selfish' and 'irresponsible.' A day later Biden praised the governor for how he prepped the Sunshine State to weather the storm. Since replacing her boss at the top of the Democratic ticket, Harris has struggled to balance remaining loyal to her unpopular boss while also presenting herself as the 'candidate of change' and distancing her campaign from the failures of the Biden administration.

US and Iran maneuvering for influence in post-war Lebanon	The American approach appears to focus on encouraging the formation of a new government that excludes Hezbollah from power. By Baruch Yedid, TPS Washington and Tehran are maneuvering for influence in post-war Lebanon as the US seeks to reduce Hezbollah’s dominance over the country. Recent U.S. efforts suggest a strategic push to leverage Hezbollah’s perceived vulnerability. The Iran-backed terror has been badly weakened by the assassinations of its top leaders, including Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah. There is a growing consensus within the U.S. and its Arab allies that Lebanon’s political landscape could undergo substantial changes. Meetings between U.S. officials and Lebanese figures such as Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri have centered around resolving the country’s political deadlock and holding presidential elections. The American approach appears to focus on encouraging the formation of a new government that excludes Hezbollah from power. U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon, Dorothy Shea, has met with various political factions from the country’s Sunni, Christian and Druze communities to discuss a future where Hezbollah no longer controls the nation’s borders and major infrastructure. American officials have reportedly urged preparations for a new political reality, with Hezbollah sidelined from governance. In response, Iran has stepped up its own diplomatic activity in Lebanon. Shortly after a visit by Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, the Speaker of Iran’s Parliament, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, made a high-profile visit to Beirut. Ghalibaf’s visit included stops in Beirut’s Dahiya district, a Hezbollah stronghold that had been bombed by Israel just a day prior. The visit was seen as a sign of Tehran’s determination to maintain its foothold in Lebanon. The situation in Lebanon is further complicated by the role of the Lebanese military, which the U.S. has been supporting financially, including the establishment of a new division in southern Lebanon. There is speculation that the United States views the current Chief of Staff, General Joseph Aoun, as a potential leader in a reformed political order. Washington’s support for the Lebanese Army also includes efforts to increase its control over Beirut’s Rafik Hariri International Airport, a move seen as intended to curb Hezbollah’s influence over air traffic and reduce the risk of further Israeli strikes. Lebanese media reports suggest that American diplomats have assured Lebanese officials that de-escalation measures, including an end to airstrikes on Hezbollah-controlled areas, could be achieved if progress is made toward political reform. The conflict’s aftermath has already led to a temporary halt in attacks on the Dahiya neighborhood following an Israeli attempt to eliminate Wafik Safa, a senior Hezbollah figure. The political landscape in Lebanon is showing signs of a shift. Prominent political figures are increasingly vocal about the need for change. Gebran Bassil, head of the Free Patriotic Movement and a traditional Hezbollah ally, recently remarked, 'We demanded from Hezbollah not to link Gaza to Lebanon, but no one listened.' Similarly, Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces party, has argued that a new president is essential for resolving the political crisis and achieving a ceasefire. Geagea has also called for the implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1559 of of 2004 which mandates the disarmament of militias, including Hezbollah. However, this stance contrasts with that of Speaker Nabih Berri, who argues that Resolution 1701, which followed the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, effectively supersedes Resolution 1559. The latter’s demand for the disbandment of militias has been a point of contention, given that it also applies to Berri’s own Amal Movement. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Hezbollah is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. Israel has expressed dissatisfaction with the scope of these discussions and demands Resolution 1559. Israeli officials insist that any ceasefire or political settlement in Lebanon include disarming Hezbollah After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, the Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. According to figures released by the government on Sept. 29, more than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes.

Contradicting Netanyahu, Lebanese PM says US ‘guaranteed’ Israel ...	Despite denials by senior Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Netanyahu, Lebanese premier appears to confirm reports that Netanyahu agreed to Biden’s demand to dramatically curtail airstrikes in Beirut. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Lebanon’s prime minister appeared to contradict claims by senior Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that Israel did not commit to the Biden administration to drastically limit the number of airstrikes in Beirut. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Najib Mikati told Al Jazeera that his government has 'received American guarantees' that Israel will limit its air campaign in the Lebanese capital city, following a series of high-profile strikes in Beirut’s Dahieh neighborhood, which houses Hezbollah’s headquarters. Earlier this week, multiple Israeli media outlets reported that Netanyahu had agreed to President Joe Biden’s demand that the IDF strictly limit its attacks in Beirut, noting that following a flurry of activity in the Lebanese capital, no strikes have been conducted there since last Thursday. A day earlier, Netanyahu spoke with Biden, marking the first conversation between the two in six weeks. According to a report Monday night by Kan 11, the IDF received written instructions Friday morning not to carry out further strikes inside Beirut. The report claimed that members of the security cabinet were fuming over the decision, saying they had not been consulted or even notified of the decision, and demanded it be revoked. Netanyahu on Monday rejected the claims, saying the IDF will 'continue to strike Hezbollah without mercy everywhere in Lebanon, including Beirut.' One senior Israeli official quoted by The Times of Israel also denied the claim Israel was limiting its operations in Beirut. 'Israel attacks everywhere in Lebanon, including Beirut. We proved this recently, and we will prove it again in the coming days, in accordance with operational considerations.'

UK’s Conservative government was poised to impose sanctions on Is...	Prior to the July elections which swept the Tories from power, the Sunak government was preparing sanctions against two senior Israeli government ministers over their support for 'extreme settlers.' By World Israel News Staff The British government under Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was poised to impose sanctions against two senior Israeli government ministers, before the government was swept from office in a historic electoral defeat. Speaking with the BBC on Tuesday, former British Prime Minister David Cameron, who served as Foreign Secretary under Prime Minister Sunak, revealed that on the eve of the July General Election, his office had been drawing up sanctions to impose on Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit) and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party). Cameron said he had been 'working up' the sanctions plan, which targeted the two ministers, whom he decried as 'extremist,' over their support for 'extreme settlers' and their criticism of international demands to allow aid into the Gaza Strip after the October 7th atrocities. Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, Cameron recalled, had 'said things like encouraging people to stop aid convoys going into Gaza, they have encouraged extreme settlers in the West Bank with the appalling things they have been carrying out.' Sources in Whitehall cited by the BBC claimed that the sanctions would have included a travel ban on the two, along with economic sanctions, including the freezing of any assets in the UK or held by British entities. The former premier explained that the sanctions were not imposed prior to the July election since they would have been perceived as being 'too much of a political act.' Cameron said the sanctions were intended to send a message to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that 'this is not good enough and has to stop.' On July 4th, British voters handed the Tories a historic defeat, with Keir Starmer's Labour Party winning 411 seats out of 650 in the House of Commons, a gain of 209 since the 2019 election, while the Conservatives plummeted from 365 seats in 2019 to just 121 - the worst showing in the party's near two-hundred-year history.

Israeli ministers demand explanation for pause in Beirut strikes	The Israeli Air Force has not struck Hezbollah targets in the Lebanese capital in four days. By JNS Israeli ministers demand answers over reported pause in Beirut attacks Members of the Cabinet say they were excluded from the alleged decision to halt strikes against Hezbollah in the Lebanese capital. Kan News reported on Monday that Israeli Cabinet ministers are furious about being excluded from a decision reportedly to pause attacks in Beirut. The Israeli Air Force has not struck Hezbollah targets in the Lebanese capital in four days, with Kan reporting that the directive was issued in writing on Friday morning, following an unusual Israeli strike in western Beirut on Thursday that resulted in dozens of casualties. The Americans reportedly sent an angry message to Jerusalem following the western Beirut strike, because in a phone call the previous day, U.S. President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to 'avoid harming civilians in densely populated areas.' After a long period of American backing for Israel’s actions against Hezbollah in Lebanon, U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein over the weekend called the western Beirut strike 'absolutely unacceptable.' According to the Kan report, the political-security Cabinet ministers only found out about the instructions to avoid Beirut from the media, causing outrage. Sources told Kan that the ministers will demand answers from Netanyahu and the security establishment at the upcoming Cabinet meeting, unless the Beirut strikes resume. An Israeli official on Sunday night denied Hebrew media reports that Israel’s political echelon had directed the Israel Defense Forces to pause airstrikes against Hezbollah targets in Beirut. The reports are 'entirely false,' the source told the Times of Israel, adding that 'Israel maintains freedom of action all across Lebanon, depending on the location of the targets.' Netanyahu held another security consultation on Monday evening about an Israeli strike on Iran and about the Israeli response in Lebanon to the deadly Hezbollah drone attack on an IDF base, said Kan. 'According to a source familiar with the discussions, Israel plans to launch a broad attack in Lebanon, possibly even in Beirut, despite the directive issued on Friday morning to avoid strikes in the Lebanese capital,' Kan reported. 'According to the source, the prime minister has instructed that any strike in Beirut requires his personal approval, following his conversation with President Biden.' On Tuesday morning, the IDF reported that more than 200 Hezbollah terrorist targets in Southern Lebanon and deep within the country, including terrorist cells, anti-tank-missile posts and surface-to-surface missile launchers, were struck over the course of 24 hours. On Monday, Israel intercepted three surface-to-surface missiles fired at the center of the country, including Tel Aviv, by Hezbollah in Lebanon. IAF fighter jets attacked the launchers in Lebanon from which the missiles were fired.

In Jenin, two wanted terrorists barricaded in a building shot at soldiers. One of the terrorists was killed and three terror suspects were arrested. In a separate incident, in the Jenin area, soldiers killed a wanted member of Palestinian Islamic Jihad in a short-range encounter. Overall, 20 Palestinians were arrested and soldiers seized rifles, vests, ammunition and weapons parts. No casualties were reported to the Israeli forces.

Netanyahu: Israel will respond to Iran ‘based on national securit...	Netanyahu had reportedly informed Biden that Israel’s retaliatory strike on Iran would avoid nuclear and oil sites. By JNS The decision to respond to Iran’s missile attack against Israel will be 'based on Israel’s national security needs,' according to a statement released by the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu overnight Monday. 'We listen to the American government’s thoughts, but will make our final decisions based on Israel’s national security needs,' the statement continued. The statement was an apparent response to a Washington Post report on Monday that Netanyahu had informed U.S. President Joe Biden that Israel’s retaliatory strike on the Islamic Republic would avoid oil and nuclear installations and instead focus on military sites. A U.S. official and an official familiar with the matter told the Post that the comments were made during a phone call last week between the two leaders. The latter official said that the retaliatory action would be adjusted to avoid the perception of 'political interference in the U.S. elections.' Both officials suggested that the alleged softening of Netanyah’s stance in favor of a more limited strike was related to Washington’s decision to deploy in Israel a THAAD advanced aerial defense system to defend against a potential Iranian response. The Israeli strike on Iran would be carried out before the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5, the official familiar with the matter said, because a lack of action could be seen by the regime in Tehran as a sign of weakness. 'It will be one in a series of responses,' she said. Jerusalem’s target list will likely include Iranian military and energy infrastructure, but not nuclear facilities or assassinations, NBC News reported on Saturday, citing U.S. officials. However, the sources stressed that Israel has not decided on the type or timing of strikes. The Jewish state has vowed a significant response to Tehran’s second-ever direct attack on Oct. 1, in which over 180 ballistic missiles were fired at Israel from Iranian soil. The Israeli military with the assistance of the United States and Jordan shot down most of the missiles, with the sole casualty of the attack being a Palestinian man from Gaza who was struck by falling missile debris near Jericho. The damages from the Iranian attack are estimated at 150 million to 200 million shekels ($40 million to $53 million), according to an initial assessment by the Israel Tax Authority published on Sunday. Since the Oct. 1 attack, approximately 2,500 claims have been submitted to the Israeli government, including some 2,200 instances of damage to buildings and 300 claims of damage to vehicles and their contents. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Oct. 9 that Israel’s strike 'will be powerful, precise and above all—surprising,' adding that the Islamic regime 'will not understand what happened and how it happened.'

Israeli forces capture Hamas suicide bomber cell behind Tel Aviv ...	Hamas terror cell responsible for suicide bombing attack in Tel Aviv apprehended, foiling planned bombing attacks. By World Israel News Staff Israeli authorities announced Tuesday the capture of a Hamas terror cell responsible for planning suicide bombing attacks in Israeli cities, including a recent botched bombing attempt in south Tel Aviv. On August 18th, Jafar Muna, a Hamas terrorist from the Palestinian Authority-administered city of Shechem (Nablus) in Samaria, was killed when an explosive device he was carrying in a backpack exploded prematurely as he was walking down a street in south Tel Aviv at night. One person, a 33-year-old man, was injured in the attack. The subsequent investigation, launched by the Shin Bet internat security agency in conjunction with Israel Police, revealed that Muna was part of a terrorist cell operating out of Shechem, which itself was being directed by Hamas operatives in Turkey. In a joint operation of the IDF and the Shin Bet, eight members of the terror cell were recently apprehended during a raid in Shechem, during which two four-kilo (8.8-pound) suicide bomb vests, which had already been prepped for use in additional bombing attacks, were seized by Israeli security personnel. According to a statement released by prosecutors Tuesday, the Hamas suicide bomber cell was run by Abada Bilal, a prominent Hamas operative in Turkey who had been jailed by Israel until 2011, when he was released as part of the deal securing the release of Gilad Shalit. Military prosecutors filed security charges against the eight terrorists at an army court on Tuesday. Charges are expected to be filed in the coming days against a ninth suspect, a resident of the Beit Hanina neighborhood in eastern Jerusalem, who is accused of driving the Muna from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv to carry out the August 18th attack. 'The investigation clearly highlights the entrenchment of Hamas' command in Turkey and the extensive efforts by Hamas' overseas leadership to inflame the region and carry out suicide bombings in Israel,' the Shin Bet and Israel Police said in a joint statement.

After year of war, Israel running low on missile interceptors	Following thousands of rocket attacks from Hamas and Hezbollah, two massive ballistic missile attacks from Iran, and sporadic missile and drone attacks from Yemenite Houthis, Israel is reportedly running low on interceptor missiles that could leave air defenses ‘stretched.’ By World Israel News Staff Israel’s air defense network is facing a possible shortage of interceptor missiles, and is at risk of being 'stretched' thin in future confrontations with Iran and Hezbollah, ex-military officials and experts told The Financial Times. 'Israel’s munitions issue is serious,' Dana Stroul, a former American Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East, told the Times. 'If Iran responds to an Israel attack, and Hezbollah joins in too, Israel air defenses will be stretched.' According to Tuesday’s report, the U.S. is working to help relieve the impending shortage, including the impending deployment of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missile defense systems in Israel. Even with U.S. assistance, however, Israel could soon be facing a 'tipping point,' Stroul continued. 'The U.S. can’t continue supplying Ukraine and Israel at the same pace. We are reaching a tipping point.' Meanwhile, Israeli suppliers said they are working round the clock to keep the IDF supplied with interceptor missiles. 'Some of our lines are working 24 hours, seven days a week. Our goal is to meet all our obligations,' said Boaz Levy, CEO of Israel Aerospace Industries. But even Levy acknowledged that supply has been lagging far behind demand. 'It is no secret that we need to replenish stocks.' IDF Lt. Col. Assaf Orion warned that Hezbollah, which possesses a far larger military capability than Hamas did even at the outset of the war, could potentially carry out vastly larger rocket and missile attacks that it has done hitherto. 'We are not seeing Hezbollah’s full capability yet. It has only been firing at around a tenth of its estimated prewar launching capacity, a few hundred rockets a day instead of as many as 2,000.'

Hezbollah is running out of money	Three main cash pipelines for Hezbollah have been severely impacted by Israeli operations in recent weeks. By JBN Hezbollah is facing an unprecedented financial crisis as Israel’s intensified offensive disrupts its key funding sources. According to VOA News, three main cash pipelines for Hezbollah have been severely impacted by Israeli operations in recent weeks. The first and most significant is Al-Qard al-Hasan (AQAH), a quasi-banking institution operated by Hezbollah without an official Lebanese government license. AQAH, originally founded in 1982 as a charitable organization providing interest-free loans to needy Lebanese Shiites, has grown into a major financial institution with branches throughout Hezbollah-controlled areas. Estimates by the US Treasury Department suggest that AQAH had amassed about half a billion dollars. However, Israeli airstrikes in southern Beirut last month allegedly destroyed the majority of Hezbollah’s AQAH vaults. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s commercial banking system is under immense pressure. Despite being insolvent on paper, these banks still hold significant cash reserves. However, many of Lebanon’s wealthiest bankers have fled the country, fearing potential targeting by Israel for their associations with Hezbollah. 'I’m hearing from Lebanese bankers, including Hezbollah financiers, that Lebanon’s wealthiest bankers who can afford to fly have fled to Europe and the Gulf, fearing they could be targeted next by Israel for helping Hezbollah,' say former US State Dept. official David Asher. 'These Lebanese bankers, most of them billionaires, see the wind is blowing against Hezbollah, so they are not going to let it take millions of dollars out of their banks, which still have cash despite being bankrupt on paper,' he said. 'They know that if they do, Israel probably will eliminate them, too.' Lastly, direct delivery of cash via flights to Beirut’s airport, particularly from Hezbollah’s patron Iran, has also been disrupted. In September, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari announced that Israeli warplanes had begun patrolling Beirut’s airspace and would not allow hostile flights to land. While Hagari specifically mentioned weapons, sources suggest that cash deliveries have also been affected. Analysts in the report note that the terror group is 'facing a very serious financial problem' and is now unable to pay rank-and-file members who have fled their homes. However, others caution that Hezbollah’s fanatical war against Israel depends more on the availability of food and ammunition than cash reserves.

IDF soldier killed fighting Hamas in south Gaza	Koren Bitan, 19, from Rosh HaAyin, east of Tel Aviv, served in Battalion 450, part of the Bislamach Brigade. By JNS Israel Defense Forces Sgt. Koren Bitan was killed while fighting Hamas terrorists in the southern Gaza Strip, the army said on Monday night. Bitan, 19, from Rosh HaAyin, east of Tel Aviv, served in Battalion 450, part of the Bislamach Brigade, the military body responsible for the training of all Infantry Corps squad commanders and platoon sergeants. His family was notified of his death, the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit said. On Monday morning, the military announced that the Lebanon-based Hezbollah terrorist organization killed four IDF troops in a drone strike on a Golani Brigade training base near Binyamina on Sunday night. The IDF identified them as Sgt. Omri Tamari, 19, from Mazkeret Batya; Sgt. Yosef Hieb, 19, from Tuba-Zangariyye; Sgt. Yoav Agmon, 19, from Binyamina-Giv’at Ada; and Sgt. Alon Amitay, 19, from Ramot Naftali. On Friday, an IDF soldier was killed in southern Gaza. Staff Sgt. Ittai Fogel, 22, served as a tank commander in the 46th Armored Battalion of the IDF’s 401st 'Iron Tracks' Brigade. He was from Yakir in Samaria. On Thursday, three Israeli reservists were killed and two others seriously wounded when their vehicle hit an explosive device in the Jabalia area of the northern Gaza Strip. The slain men were named as Master Sgt. (res.) Ori Moshe Borenstein, 32, from Moreshet; Master Sgt. (res.) Tzvi Matityahu Marantz, 32, from Bnei Adam; and Maj. (res.) Netanel Hershkovitz, 37, from Jerusalem. All three were part of the 5460th support unit of the IDF’s 460th Brigade. The total death toll among Israeli soldiers since the start of the Gaza ground campaign on Oct. 27, 2023, stands at 353, and at 740 on all fronts since the beginning of the latest conflict on Oct. 7. Additionally, Chief Inspector Arnon Zamora, a member of the Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, was fatally wounded during a hostage-rescue mission in Gaza in June, and civilian defense contractor Liron Yitzhak was mortally wounded in the Strip in May.

Iranian Quds commander spotted, squashing rumors of his death	Reports had speculated that Esmail Qaani had been killed in an IAF airstrikein Beirut or had a heart attack under interrogation as a possible Israel agent. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, Esmail Qaani, showed up on Iranian television Monday night, squashing persistent rumors of his death. A short clip on social media showed the white-haired leader of the IRGC unit that coordinates the activities of the country’s terror proxies wiping his face with a handkerchief and looking uncomfortable as he sat among dozens of other men. Qaani was part of the audience at a ceremony in the Iraqi city of Karbala marking the return of the body of his colleague, Abbas Nilforoushan, who had been in the underground Beirut headquarters of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah along with some 20 Hezbollah commanders when the IDF destroyed it in an airstrike on September 27. Rumors of his death began to surface after the IDF subsequently eliminated Nasrallah’s just-announced successor, Hashem Safieddine, early this month. Reports said that Qaani was supposed to be at a meeting with Safieddine that Israeli jets bombed, and contact with the top terrorist had been lost after the hit. Another rumor bandied about was that Qaani was being interrogated by his terror colleagues on suspicion of being an Israeli agent due to the successful elimination of both Nasrallah and Safieddine, as well as dozens of other senior Hezbollah officers over the last several weeks. The Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya news site said that the terror leader was 'subject to surveillance and isolation, after the Israeli assassinations of prominent Iranian leaders.' Sky News Arabic then reported that he was in the hospital after suffering a heart attack during interrogation. Iranian officials had denied that he was dead or suspected of any wrongdoing, with Deputy Quds Force commander Iraj Masjedi saying last week that 'He is in good health and is carrying out his activities.' A Qaani adviser even told the Iranian Tasnim news site last Monday that his boss 'will receive the Fath medal from the Supreme Leader in the coming days.' The medal has been awarded to war heroes, military commanders and politicians since 1989. Qaani had been appointed to his powerful position following the 2020 U.S. assassination of his legendary predecessor, Qassem Soleimani, in a drone strike on his car near Baghdad’s international airport.

1 murdered, 4 wounded in terrorist shooting on Israeli highway	Terrorist opens fire at drivers on major Israeli highway near Mediterranean coast, killing one and wounding four others. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News One man was killed and four people were wounded in a terrorist shooting attack on a major Israeli highway near the Mediterranean coast Tuesday morning. The attack occurred on Route 4 near the Yavne Interchange, when a terrorist opened fire on passing cars wounding several people. During the attack, the terrorist was shot and killed on the scene by a civilian who, according to Israeli media outlets, received his personal firearm license three months ago. Emergency first responders from Magen David Adom (MDA) and United Hatzalah were dispatched to the scene to treat the wounded before evacuating them to Assuta Medical center in Ashdod and Kaplan Medical Center in Rehovot. 'We provided initial treatment at the scene and performed CPR on a 30-year-old man in critical condition,' said United Hatzalah volunteer first responders Doron Sabah, Shmuel Bechor, and Alexi Gretzniko,v who treated a critically injured man at the first scene. 'We were also told that other first responders and a United Hatzalah ambulance team treated at two additional locations a person in light to moderate condition who was transported to the hospital by the United Hatzalah ambulance, and a lightly injured man. It was also reported that another driver was injured by shards of glass and continued driving to the Nir Galim intersection.' One of the five people injured, a doctor, was struck by a passing car after he pulled over to treat one of the shooting victims. Another victim, a man roughly 30 years of age, was listed in critical condition following the shooting, and later succumbed to his wounds after being evacuated from the scene. Kaplan Medical Center reported that a 37-year-old victim who had been shot in the thigh was in moderate condition. MDA reported that another victim, in his early 40s, was treated for wounds caused by broken glass after his car was hit by gunfire.

Netanyahu pledges to Biden not to attack Iranian nuclear faciliti...	Amid reports Israeli premier has promised Washington Israel will curtail strikes in Beirut, Netanyahu also said to have vowed not to retaliate against Iran's nuclear program or energy production. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told President Joe Biden recently that Israel is prepared to refrain from striking Iran's nuclear program as well as its oil and natural gas reserves and infrastructure, focusing instead on military targets, according to a report by The Washington Post. Citing two officials with knowledge of the conversation said that during the phone call between Biden and Netanyahu last Wednesday, the Israeli premier said he was willing to forgo attacking Iranian nuclear facilities and the country's energy infrastructure, and instead limit Israel's targets to the Iranian military. The conversation, which was the first between the two leaders in six weeks, came after Iran launched 182 ballistic missiles at Israel, prompting Israel to vow a harsh retaliation against Tehran. But following the October 1st attack, the Biden administration has pressured Israel to restrain its response, and in particular has urged Jerusalem not to strike either Iranian nuclear facilities nor Iranian oil and natural gas sites or infrastructure, warning that such attacks could lead to a major escalation in the region. Neither the Prime Minister's Office nor the White House responded to the Post report. The sources cited by the Post indicated that Netanyahu's decision to embrace a 'more moderate' approach was tied to the White House's decision to send Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ballistic missile defense units to Israel to bolster Israel's missile defense network. Prior to the October 9th conversation, Israel had reportedly refused to commit not to strike Iran's nuclear facilities and energy production sites, and had even declined to share details of its plans to retaliate against Iran.

BOMBSHELL: IDF website helped Hezbollah carry out deadly attack o...	The Israeli army published maps of bases, including labeling of critical assets, on its publicly accessible recruitment website. By World Israel News Staff Much of the planning of Hezbollah's recent deadly drone attack on a Golani Brigade training base and the Hamas October 7th massacres were likely aided by information that the Israeli military published online, according to a bombshell new report. For years, the IDF recruitment website Metgaisim has published maps of bases, information about the location of specific buildings, such as dining halls, and vacation schedules for soldiers, KAN News reported. This data being publicly accessible online meant that Hezbollah and Hamas had easy access to crucial information, which they probably leveraged to plot their attacks. The October 7th onslaught, which saw multiple army bases overrun by terrorists and the massacres of virtually all soldiers present, raised questions regarding Hamas' intelligence sources. Those attacks saw Hamas gunmen systematically conquer army bases, with a clear understanding of which structures were important to attack first. More recently, on Sunday evening, an explosive drone launched by Hezbollah struck the dining hall of an army base, at a time when the facility was packed with soldiers eating dinner. The mass casualty event saw 4 soldiers - all 19 years old - killed, seven more severely wounded, and dozens of others hospitalized in critical condition. KAN discovered that the location of the base's dining hall, as well as other important information about the base, was publicly available on the Metgaisim website. 'Last night was crazy,' Yousef, the manager of a restaurant in Kafr Qara, told AFP the morning after the attack. 'There was a huge boom and then suddenly ambulances started driving past, first one, then two, then three and more and more.' 'There were so many police cars and paramedics,' he added. The restaurant is located about a mile away from the base that was struck. 'We’ve been open here for two years and didn’t realize that we were next to such an important base,' Yousef told AFP.

Sderot, Motorola sued for Oct. 7th bomb shelter failures	Families sue for 12 million shekels after doors of 'smart' bomb shelter failed to open, leaving victims vulnerable to rocket fire and Hamas gunmen. By World Israel News Staff The families of October 7th victims who were murdered by Hamas terrorists in Sderot are suing the municipality and Motorola, after their relatives were locked out of a bomb shelters whose doors were meant to automatically open in the event of a rocket siren. The plaintiffs are demanding 12 million shekels (some $3.1 million) in damages, after a so-called 'smart shelter' was inaccessible during intense rocket bombardment and a subsequent attack by Hamas gunmen. On October 7th, 2023, a bus transporting 13 Russian=speaking retirees on an organized day trip to the Dead Sea stopped in Sderot as the rocket fire began. Due to its proximity to the Strip and the frequency of rocket attacks on the city, Sderot has numerous public shelters which are meant to be quickly accessible to residents. However, after a modernization project with telecommunications company Motorola, the doors of the bomb shelters remain shut at all times. In theory, the doors of the 'smart shelters' are meant to open as soon as a rocket siren is activated in the city. But despite the repeated rocket sirens on October 7th which should have triggered the doors to automatically open, the shelter's doors remained locked. Several members of the tour group sent photos and videos of themselves trying to force open the locked shelter doors to their family and friends. Minutes later, Hamas terrorists shot and killed the entire group as they stood in front of the shelter, with only their driver surviving. The lawusit states that had the doors opened, the tour group may have been able to hide from the terrorists and survive the attack. The suit also claims that the Sderot municipality intentionally hid information about the shelter malfunctioning from the families. At least 50 people were murdered in Sderot as Hamas terrorists rampaged through the city. A gun battle that lasted more than 24 hours at the Sderot police station saw more than 20 police officers killed.

Netanyahu refutes accusation that Israel deliberately harmed UNIF...	Netanyahu: 'On the day that Israel began its ground operation next to our border with Lebanon, we asked them (UNIFIL workers) specifically, 'Please leave this area so you're not harmed.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to accusations that the IDF targeted The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) purposely. On Monday, Netanyahu said, 'The charge that Israel deliberately attacked UNIFIL personnel is completely false. It's exactly the opposite. Israel repeatedly asks UNIFIL to get out of harm's way. It repeatedly asked them to temporarily leave the combat zone, which is right next to Israel's border with Lebanon.' On Friday, two UN workers were injured during a strike near a UNIFIL watchtower in Lebanon, sparking international outrage. Although the IDF said it was necessary to strike at an 'immediate threat' close to the building, Israel's military received criticism from leaders, including US President Joe Biden, who said he was 'absolutely, positively' urging Israel to stop shooting at UN peacekeepers. The Israeli military expressed 'deep concern' at the wounding of the two UN workers and insisted that they requested the UNFIL workers to evacuate since Hezbollah had embedded their infrastructure in UNFIL buildings. Netanyahu repeated that Israel didn't intend to harm the UN workers but had asked them to leave the premises to avoid danger. 'On the day that Israel began its ground operation next to our border with Lebanon, we asked them specifically, 'Please leave this area so you're not harmed.'' Netanyahu emphasized, 'Israel is not fighting UNIFIL; it is not fighting the people of Lebanon.' He explained that Hezbollah uses UNFIL workers as shields and hides its terror facilities in their buildings. 'Hezbollah uses UNIFIL facilities and positions as cover while it attacks Israeli cities and communities. These attacks have claimed the lives of many Israelis, including yesterday,' he added. The premier said that Israel will continue to defend itself against Hezbollah and eliminate its terror infrastructure, and that it regrets harm to UN workers and will strive to prevent future harm. However, it is incumbent on UNFIL workers to evacuate when ordered by the IDF. On Sunday, Netanyahu appealed directly to UN Secretary Antonio Guterres to get UNIFIL's forces out of harm's way. 'Mr. Secretary General, get the UNIFIL forces out of harm's way. It should be done right now, immediately,' Netanyahu said.

How deadly Hezbollah drones evaded Israel’s detection system	On Sunday, a Hezbollah drone struck a base outside of Binyamina, killing 4 soldiers and injuring 60 people. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Although Israel has relied on defense systems such as the Iron Dome to keep its population safe from missile and rocket attacks, low-flying, small drones, and UAVs, such as the one responsible for the deadly strike at a military base on Sunday, pose a new challenge for Israel's military. On Sunday, a Hezbollah drone struck a base outside of Binyamina, killing 4 soldiers and injuring 60 people. The drone responsible was a a Sayyad 107 model manufactured in Iran and supplied to Hezbollah. It is an elusive drone that can be programmed to change direction and easily evade detection. The Sayyad 107 has a range of up to 100 kilometers, is low-flying, and has a faint signal that often eludes radar detection. Hezbollah launched these drones along with rockets to confuse Israel's defense systems using a variety of different aerial weapons. Iron Dome managed to intercept one of the drones, but the other disappeared and couldn't be tracked by military helicopters and fighter jets. The IDF is launching an investigation to discover why military jets and helicopters could not detect the drones. It is believed that the drones were programmed to vary their altitude and switch to a low-flying mode that would allow them to fly under the radar. Hezbollah has become more adept at using advanced drones and UAVs and has managed to cause civilian casualties in its nearly constant attacks against Israel since October 8th. It is estimated that Israel intercepts over half of the drones and UAVs launched into Israel. The Iranian-made drones are also able to stay on course and strike their targets even when faced with GPS jamming. The solution for detecting and intercepting these advanced, light, low-flying drones could lie in the laser-based system Israel is developing for use on vehicles and on the ground. This technology will be fully operational in mid-2025. Until then, Israel's military will have to remain vigilant in dealing with these advanced drones.

IDF intercepts Hezbollah rockets fired at central Israel	There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. By JNS Hezbollah on Monday launched rockets from Lebanon at central Israel, triggering sirens in the Sharon, Menashe and Wadi Ara areas. The Israeli Air Force intercepted all of the projectiles. The IDF said that the details of the attack were under review. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. The barrage came after the Iranian terror proxy killed four Israeli soldiers in a drone strike on a Golani Brigade training base near Binyamina on Sunday night. Hezbollah fired some 320 projectiles at Israel on Saturday, the Yom Kippur holiday. The terror army launched five rockets at central Israel on Oct. 7, the first anniversary of the Hamas-led massacre, triggering sirens in multiple areas. Hezbollah claimed that the target of the attack was the Glilot military intelligence base between Tel Aviv and Herzliya. Since Hezbollah joined the war against the Jewish state in support of Hamas on Oct. 8, 2023, the Lebanese terrorist organization has fired more than 12,400 rockets, missiles and drones.

Hamas is preventing civilians from evacuating northern Gaza	A resident of Jabalia said that Hamas is hitting Palestinians to prevent them from following IDF evacuation orders. By JNS Hamas terrorists are preventing Palestinian civilians in the northern Gaza city of Jabalia from evacuating to humanitarian zones amid the Israel Defense Forces operation in the area, the military said on Monday. During a call with a representative of the Intelligence Corps’ Unit 504, a resident of Jabalia said that Hamas is hitting Palestinians to prevent them from following IDF evacuation orders, according to a recording. 'The problem is that when we follow the army’s instructions and try to go to Al-Mawasi [humanitarian zone], there are people who come out against us and start hitting us with sticks, telling us ‘Go back, go back,'' the Jabalia resident told a military representative in the IDF recording. 'What should we do?' the Gazan asked the IDF. 'We want to leave. We took our belongings and wanted to leave, and now they’re hitting us and telling us to ‘go home, go home,’ what should we do?' The Palestinian stressed the attackers were not members of the Israeli army but from Hamas and that 'they keep hitting us and returning us.' The army noted in a statement, 'While the IDF makes every effort to move civilians away from the battlefield, Hamas continues to make every effort to keep civilians in the line of fire.' IDF soldiers have been operating in Jabalia since Oct. 6 to prevent Hamas from reestablishing its terrorist presence in the city. Ahead of the raid, the military urged all noncombatants to evacuate to the expanded Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, which has field hospitals, tents, food, water, medicine and medical equipment. On Monday, the IDF announced that three of its divisions 'continue to operate throughout Gaza and have eliminated terrorists in face-to-face encounters and airstrikes in the past day.' IDF soldiers 'continue to destroy terrorist infrastructures, locate weapons, locate tunnels and neutralize them,' the military said. In Jabalia, at least 10 terrorists were killed in Air Force strikes and close-quarters combat over the past day, the IDF said on Sunday night. In central Gaza, special forces operators from the IDF’s Multidimensional Unit killed some 10 gunmen who posed a threat to the forces using 'precision weaponry and attack drones,' the statement noted. Israeli ground forces entered the Palestinian coastal enclave following a weeks-long air campaign in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led terrorist attacks in the northwestern Negev, in which terrorists murdered some 1,200 people, wounded thousands of others, and abducted more than 250 men, women and children to the Strip—97 of whom are still there, along with four others who entered Gaza earlier. Jerusalem’s war goals for Gaza are to destroy Hamas’s capabilities, ensure that it cannot threaten Israel again, and return all captives. The death toll among Israeli troops since the start of the Gaza ground incursion stands at 352, and at 739 on all fronts since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 massacre, according to official IDF military data.

Iran’s oil revenues have more then doubled to $41 billion since B...	Iran systematically diverts a portion of its oil revenues to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its regional terror proxies like Hezbollah and Hamas. By JBN When former President Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions, critics decried the move as unnecessarily hawkish. Yet, an explosive new report by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) tells a compelling story. Under Joe Biden’s watch, Iran has seen a significant surge in its oil export revenues, with figures soaring to over $41 billion in 2023. The rise in Iran’s oil exports is striking when compared to the mere $8 billion recorded in 2020, during the final year of the Trump administration. According to OPEC data, Iran’s daily export volume of crude oil, condensates, and petroleum products averaged about 1.73 million barrels last year, which is a staggering two and a half times higher than when Biden assumed office. Traditionally, Iran systematically diverts a portion of its oil revenues to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its regional terror proxies like Hezbollah and Hamas. However, Iran’s Supreme Audit Court announced on Sunday that the country has fallen short of its budgeted oil revenue targets by 26% despite increased exports. Foreign economic policy analysts attribute the discrepancy to several factors. Primarily, Iran incurs substantial costs in circumventing US sanctions, including offering significant discounts to smugglers in China. Earlier this year, the advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) disclosed satellite evidence showing two vessels, HECATE and ELVA, offloading massive cargoes of Iranian crude at China’s Dongjiakou port. Furthermore, a portion of Iran’s fuel oil exports is bartered for gasoline due to domestic shortages, while some oil is provided to Syria free of charge. In response, President Masoud Pezeshkian has ordered the government’s share of oil export revenues be increased to 65.5%, while the National Development Fund’s share be halved to 20%. In other words, more money for missiles and less for starving Iranian citizens.

Report reveals mental health crisis in Gaza border communities	50% of the Jewish communities in the area show moderate or high levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). By Pesach, Benson, TPS One year after the Hamas attacks of October 7, Western Negev residents continue to struggle with high levels of stress, anxiety, and trauma, according to a report released on Monday. The 'Resilience Index' report was commissioned by the New Land Now Association and conducted by researchers from Tel Aviv University, Tel Hai College, and the research company, Indicate. 'Our goal in collecting the data and pooling insights into resilience is to generate potential for growth, entrepreneurship and construction, thereby enabling the residents of the Western Negev to return home,' New Land Now chairman Dudi Gabbay said. 'As a resident of [Kibbutz] Re’im, my understanding is that every issue of the rehabilitation and development of the western Negev should happen bottom up. That is, through the people of the Western Negev and under their leadership. And in order to enable this, it is important to listen carefully to the needs of the residents, perform analysis using advanced research tools, and implement operations in the field,' he said. The report paints a concerning image of the home front in the Western Negev, with 60% of residents suffering from moderate to severe stress-related symptoms such as anxiety and depression. Additionally, 50% of the Jewish communities in the area show moderate or high levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a stark indication of the enduring emotional toll. The situation is further exacerbated by inadequate mental health resources in local towns, resulting in worsening trauma for many. One of the most striking findings is that 58% of those surveyed had either been directly impacted by the events of October 7 or had family members who were affected. The report notes that despite a year having passed, many residents remain in a state of psychological distress, with some reporting that their conditions have even deteriorated in the months following the war due to a lack of ongoing treatment and support. The report also found mounting distrust towards government authorities. In particular, residents increasingly blame the authorities for pressuring them to return home without providing sufficient safety measures or support systems. 'Public trust in the state authorities and the government is an essential and central element in the reconstruction process of the Western Negev, and therefore special resources must be invested in its improvement. In addition, as the results of the study show, improving public trust requires acting in a different manner with each and every community,' the authors said. The sense of danger remains a significant concern, with over half of the population still fearful of living in the region. The highest levels of perceived danger are linked to fears of violence in Israeli society and political instability. Social media analysis, conducted as part of the research, highlights a growing sense of insecurity among residents, particularly as discussions around the anniversary events dominate platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. The report also reveals a stark divide in resilience across different communities, with the Bedouin population displaying the lowest levels of both personal and national resilience. Among the Bedouin respondents, only 36% reported high levels of national resilience, while other indicators, such as trust in authorities and social cohesion, were similarly low. Social cohesion, which initially surged at the start of the war, has declined significantly as the conflict persisted. The report finds that feelings of unity have weakened, with only 28% of city residents and a mere 14% of those living in kibbutzim and moshavim expressing high levels of hope for the future. This decrease in morale poses a further challenge to rebuilding efforts, the report noted. 'The data are very disturbing and oblige us as a society and as a state to recognize the intensity of mental damage over time for the residents of the Otaf [Gaza border communities], and the growing gap between the residents of the Otaf and the rest of the population,' said Dr. Yossi Levi-Belz, of the Center for the Study of Suicidality and Mental Pain at the Ruppin College. 'Therefore, there is a critical importance to building targeted mental health systems For this population, along with actions to increase a sense of belonging, connection and collective support. The restoration of trust, especially among the residents of the Otaf, is essential for the restoration of national resilience, and we must act to ensure an immediate and adapted response to their mental needs,' he said. Prof. Bruria Adini from Tel Aviv University said the researchers will continue collecting data 'to measure the impact of each program on the communities to strengthen successful initiatives and improve areas that are lacking.' At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

By JNS On Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant visited the Golani Brigade training base near Binyamina, including the dining hall struck on Sunday night by a Hezbollah drone, pledging to find solutions to the threat posed by the terror group’s unmanned vehicles. The attack killed four soldiers and wounded dozens more. 'This is a difficult event with painful results,' he told Golani officers who witnessed the attack. 'We must investigate it, study the details and assimilate the lessons in a quick and professional manner.' Gallant continued: 'Faced with the threat of UAVs, we are concentrating a national effort and are engaged in developing solutions that will help deal with the threat.'

Democratic lawmaker calls Netanyahu ‘genocidal maniac,’ Israeli a...	‘Squad’ member Rashida Tlaib accuses ‘genocidal maniac’ Netanyahu of ‘burning Palestinians alive’ and starving Gazans, demanding White House end aid to Israel. By World Israel News Staff A member of the left-wing ‘Squad’ in the U.S. House of Representatives accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of genocide on Sunday, drawing a sharp rebuke from Israel’s envoy to the United Nations. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat who represents Michigan’s 12th congressional district covering much of Detroit and the Dearborn area, took to X/Twitter Sunday night to denounce Netanyahu, accusing him of intentionally killing Gaza civilians and aid workers distributing food in the Gaza Strip. 'Genocidal maniac Netanyahu is burning Palestinians alive, bombing hospitals, starving people, and killing aid workers. When will our country stop funding this madness? When?' Tlaib posted the comment shortly after the Gaza health ministry reported four people were killed and dozens more injured in a fire in the Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah. Hospital officials claimed the fire was sparked by an Israeli airstrike, though there were reports of secondary explosions, with no clear indication of they were caused by fuel tanks igniting or weapons caches being sparked. Shortly after Tlaib posted her tweet, Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon fired back at the Michigan lawmaker, accusing her of supporting the Hamas terror organization. 'The only ones who burned children alive were your buddies over at Hamas.' Last month, Tlaib came under fire from Michigan’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, who accused her of antisemitism, after Tlaib accused the state’s top prosecutor, Dana Nessel, of being influenced by her own Jewishness in the decision to bring charges against eleven anti-Israel protestors at the University of Michigan. 'The suggestion that Attorney General Nessel would make charging decisions based on her religion as opposed to the rule of law is antisemitic,' Whitmer wrote in a statement. 'Attorney General Nessel has always conducted her work with integrity and followed the rule of law. We must all use our platform and voices to call out hateful rhetoric and racist tropes.'

Thousands of Israeli homes damaged by Iran’s ballistic missile at...	Israel's tax authority says billions of shekels-worth of damage were caused by Iran's massive ballistic missile attack earlier this month, impacting thousands of homes and business properties. By World Israel News Staff The ballistic missile attack launched by Iran against Israel on October 1, 2024, resulted in an estimated 1.5 billion to 2.5 billion shekels ($40 million to $67 million) in damage to private property, making it the most expensive assault since the start of the ongoing conflict, according to the Israeli Tax Authority, The Jerusalem Post reported Monday. The attack heavily impacted residential and commercial areas near northern Tel Aviv. Within two weeks of the strike, around 2,500 claims for compensation were submitted, with over half involving damage to apartments and several businesses. One of the most affected locations was Hod Hasharon, where over 1,000 homes sustained damage. A coastal commercial and residential complex north of Tel Aviv also suffered significant hits, damaging multiple apartments and a restaurant. Additional damages were reported in other areas south of Tel Aviv, including an unoccupied school. The Israeli Tax Authority stated it has already paid 1.5 billion shekels in compensation for property losses since October 7, 2023. However, it estimates that an additional 1 billion shekels in claims are still pending, primarily for damages in the northern region that have not yet been formally reported. The attack followed increased tensions across the region. Around 60,000 Israelis evacuated their homes in northern Israel over the past year due to cross-border strikes from Hezbollah, the Iran-backed terrorist group based in Lebanon, in support of Hamas. The recent escalation in fighting has also prompted hundreds of thousands of Lebanese residents to flee southern Lebanon. Iran claimed the October 1 missile strike was retaliation for Israel’s assassinations of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Nearly 200 ballistic missiles were launched in the attack, with most of the projectiles either being shot down or landing in open spaces. The October attack marked Iran’s second direct assault on Israel this year, following a large-scale attack in April involving 300 drones and over 100 ballistic missiles. While Israel’s air defenses intercepted most of the missiles in the earlier attack, reports indicate that Iran employed more advanced weapons in the latest strike, resulting in greater penetration of Israeli airspace. The ballistic missile strike left one person dead near Jericho in the Palestinian Authority, with several others suffering minor injuries. Damage assessments remain ongoing, but the calculations exclude potential losses at key Israeli Air Force bases, including Tel Nof and Nevatim.

Israel’s FM doubles down on refusal to allow UN Secretary General...	Israel's Foreign Minister says the UN Secretary-General refused to condemn Iran's launch of 180 missiles into Israel. By Reuters and Algemeiner Staff Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz reinforced on Sunday his decision to declare U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres persona non grata over what he described as a failure to condemn Iran’s missile attack and antisemitic and anti-Israel conduct. On Oct. 2, Katz said that he was barring Guterres from entering Israel. He posted on X on Sunday that 'Guterres can continue seeking support from U.N. member states, but the decision will not change.' U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric described the initial announcement on Oct. 2 as political and 'just one more attack, so to speak, on U.N. staff that we’ve seen from the government of Israel.' He said the U.N. traditionally does not recognize the concept of persona non grata as applying to U.N. staff. When asked to respond to Katz’s remarks on Sunday, a U.N. spokesperson referred to Dujarric’s earlier comments. Dujarric also said last week that the U.N. had not received any formal communication from Israel on the matter. On Oct. 3, the U.N. Security Council expressed its full support for Guterres, saying in a statement that 'any decision not to engage with the U.N. Secretary-General or the United Nations is counterproductive, especially in the context of escalating tensions in the Middle East.' When asked last week if Guterres had been made persona non grata by Israel, Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters: 'There was a statement made … we will evaluate the relationship. We are here at the U.N., we work with the U.N. agencies, but we were disappointed.' Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles at Israel on Oct. 1 amid an escalation in fighting between Israel and its proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah. Many were intercepted in flight but some penetrated missile defenses. Guterres condemned the missile attack and 'the broadening of the Middle East conflict, with escalation after escalation.' Earlier the same day, Israel had sent troops into southern Lebanon. During a Security Council meeting a day later, Guterres said: 'As I did in relation to the Iranian attack in April – and as should have been obvious yesterday in the context of the condemnation I expressed – I again strongly condemn yesterday’s massive missile attack by Iran on Israel.'

Israel establishes national day of mourning for October 7th massa...	The date of the day of mourning will be the 25th of Tishrei – a number of days after the massacre, which occurred on Simchat Torah, the 22nd of Tishrei. By i24 News and Algemeiner Staff The Israeli government decided today (Sunday) that a 'National Day of Mourning' in memory of the October 7 massacre will be held on the 25th of Tishrei – a number of days after the massacre, which occurred on Simchat Torah, the 22nd of Tishrei. During the national day of mourning, two state memorial ceremonies will be held. The first – a state memorial ceremony for the security forces casualties in the terror attack on October 7 and the ‘Iron Sabers’ war, which will be held at Mount Herzl. The second – a state memorial ceremony for the civilian and rescue forces casualties in the terror attack on October 7 and the 'Iron Sabers' war, which will also be held at Mount Herzl. The lowering of the state flags to half-mast will take place at the time symbolizing the beginning of the massacre – 06:29 – simultaneously in two places. The government has authorized Minister Miri Regev to be the minister in charge of the state memorial ceremonies. In addition, it is recommended for the Minister of Education and the Minister of Defense to carry out activities involving memory, bravery, and hope in schools and in IDF units in order to strengthen these values in public consciousness. From the government it was conveyed: 'The events of the Seventh of October are the biggest terror attack in the history of the State of Israel. Therefore, in accordance with the government’s decision, the first anniversary of the horrific massacre will be commemorated as a national day of mourning in the State of Israel. Moreover, every year near Simchat Torah, memorial ceremonies will be held from the State of Israel in memory of the fallen and the murdered. The State of Israel will bow its head on this day and will dedicate the memory and bravery of its beloved sons and daughters, battle casualties, victims of the attack, and victims of the bombings since the Seventh of October.'

Israeli air strike eliminates Hezbollah anti-tank rocket chief	The commander, identified as Muhammad Kamal Naim, was killed in an airstrike in the southern Lebanese area of Nabatia. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Israel Defense Forces says it eliminated the commander of the anti-tank system of Hezbollah’s Radwan Unit in the Hezbollah terrorist organization on Monday. The commander, identified as Muhammad Kamal Naim, was killed in an airstrike in the southern Lebanese area of Nabatia. The IDF said he was responsible for planning and carrying out numerous attacks, including firing anti-tank rockets into northern Israel. Meanwhile, the Israeli Air Force destroyed rocket launchers used in attacks on northern and central Israel, triggering alerts in the Sharon, Menashe, and Wadi Ara areas and across northern Israel. Some of the rockets were intercepted and the rest fell in open areas. No injuries were reported. The barrage followed Hezbollah’s Sunday night drone strike on an army base in the central Israeli area of Binyamin. Four soldiers were killed and 58 injured when the UAV struck a dining hall where soldiers were eating dinner. According to an initial army assessment, two UAVs were initially identified heading towards the base from the Mediterranean. One was shot down by the Navy off the coast of Nahariya. The second was flying at a low altitude and air defense systems may have thought it too was intercepted. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, the Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities daily. According to figures released by the government on Sept. 29, more than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, the terror group is forbidden from operating in southern Lebanon south of the Litani River.

Victory: Netanyahu’s ‘day after plan’	By Caroline Glick, JNS 80% of Americans consistently told pollsters that they support Israeli victory, rather than fighting Netanyahu. The Biden-Harris administration didn’t like Netanyahu’s plans. But since they made sense to the vast majority of Israelis, and because 80% of Americans consistently told pollsters that they support Israeli victory, rather than fight Netanyahu, the administration maintained an outward stance of supporting Israel while using the U.S.’s formidable leverage over Israel to inhibit or block Israel from carrying out operations that would fundamentally change the strategic reality on the ground permanently, enabling the implementation of Netanyahu’s 'day after' plans. The administration’s demand for a 'day after' plan wasn’t a request for an actual plan. The administration was demanding an Israeli commitment not to seek to use the war to fundamentally change the strategic realities on the ground that existed on Oct. 6, 2023. The U.S. wanted those conditions, which enabled Hamas to build its army of genocide, to continue to exist at the end of the war. And it wanted Netanyahu to accept this condition, which if accepted would block all prospects for Israeli victory. From the administration’s position, the only acceptable 'day after' plan would be one that reverted the strategic balance back to what it was on Oct. 6. Gaza would be a quasi-independent Palestinian statelet. The U.S. would use the momentum of international pressure and Israeli humiliation to compel Israel to accept the establishment of a Palestinian state in Gaza, Judea, Samaria and Jerusalem, in keeping with the goals that both Vice President Kamala Harris, President Joe Biden and their advisers have repeatedly set out. This was why the U.S. opposed Israel’s ground operation in Gaza; supported Egypt in blocking Gazans from fleeing Gaza for shelter in Egypt or third countries; opposed Israel’s takeover of Rafah and the border with Gaza; slow-walked the delivery of offensive weapons, including assault rifles, tank and artillery shells and bombs for the air force in an effort to compel Israel to adopt a defensive posture; and consistently sought to coerce Israel to accept hostage deals with Hamas that would precipitate its strategic defeat in the war. This is why the administration began sanctioning Israeli citizens who they claim obstruct their goal of establishing a Palestinian state in Gaza, Judea and Samaria. Likewise, the administration’s consistent, unswerving pressure on Israel to admit massive quantities of goods into Gaza, under the headline 'humanitarian aid,' facilitated Hamas’s survival in power. The prospect of an Israeli rout of Hamas and permanent takeover of Gaza would make Israel 'too strong,' in the words of Barack Obama’s secretary of state John Kerry. And a 'too strong' Israel would be an Israel unwilling to 'make peace.' The administration’s determination to see Hamas survive and so win the war is not driven solely by its top officials’ support for Palestinian statehood. It is also driven by its overarching aim to 'balance Israel' with Iran. This goal, also bequeathed to the Biden-Harris team by Obama and his team, views Iran’s efforts to build a nuclear arsenal as justified in light of Israel’s presumptive nuclear capabilities. Similarly, Iran’s rise as a regional power through its terror armies which ring Israel and the Sunni Arab states is desirable because it strikes a 'balance of power.' Since Hamas is a member of Iran’s terror axis, the administration’s rejection of Israel’s goal of defeating Hamas and fundamentally changing the way that Gaza operates is aligned with its overarching strategic objective of preserving the Iran-centric regional strategic balance that existed on Oct. 6. From their earliest days in power, Obama and his colleagues faced a complicated challenge. The American public opposed their strategic objective, and so did America’s allies. To get past this obstacle, the Obama team developed a multipronged policy based on doing one thing and pretending to do its opposite. For instance, the administration enabled Iran to develop nuclear weapons by negotiating a deal which it billed as a nuclear non-proliferation agreement. Israel in contrast was presented as a warmonger. Since Netanyahu was the most strident opponent of Obama’s nuclear gifts to Iran, the Obama team developed a comprehensive strategy for undermining Netanyahu’s efforts to block Iran’s nuclear ambitions. The U.S. effectively placed the IDF in a box. It showered Israel with defensive systems and compelled it to sign a military assistance deal that crippled Israel’s domestic military industries to remove its strategic independence. If Israel got all its bombs from the U.S., then any offensive operations had to receive U.S. approval. Same with its air platforms, its tank and artillery ammunition and its assault rifles. The administration engaged in full-scale subversion of Netanyahu’s power by cultivating former and serving security brass to view them – rather than Netanyahu as 'the responsible adult,' and to inform them of any plans Netanyahu had to take offensive action against Iran. To this end, in 2010, Mossad chief Meir Dagan informed his CIA counterpart of Netanyahu’s plan to attack Iran’s nuclear installations and the administration quickly blocked those plans. Biden and Harris reinstated Obama’s policies both vis-à-vis the Palestinians and Iran and in regards to weakening and subverting Netanyahu—and Israel—politically and strategically immediately upon entering office. This brings us back to the issue of the 'day after.' As for Lebanon, far from supporting Israel’s efforts to devastate Hezbollah, Iran’s largest and most deadly terror army, the administration has spent the past year trying to block Israel from going on the offense against Hezbollah. Although Biden was publicly supportive of Israel’s decapitation of Hezbollah’s leadership, including Hassan Nasrallah, the administration was reportedly enraged that Israel assassinated Nasrallah. On Oct. 10, Harris repeated, yet again, that the administration seeks an immediate ceasefire and de-escalation in both Lebanon and Gaza. The implication, again, is that Harris and Biden want to protect Hezbollah—like Hamas—from defeat because they seek to revert to the Oct. 6, 2023, strategic balance which left Iran in place as a rising regional hegemon just a few steps from a nuclear arsenal. As for Iran itself, since the Tehran regime’s Oct. 1, 2024, missile attack on Israel, the administration been working feverishly to block Israel from taking out any strategic targets in a counterattack against Iran. Administration officials have consistently hinted that Israel is trying to drag the U.S. into a Middle East war. And last week, CIA Director William Burns and other top administration officials insisted in a series of statements that there are no indications that Iran seeks a nuclear arsenal. A mere glance at Iran’s front pages and parliament debates, which are flooded with calls for Iran to build nuclear weapons, exposes these claims as both fraudulent and manipulative. Despite the comprehensiveness of its echo-chamber strategy of flooding the media with anti-Netanyahu innuendo, demoralizing messages of Israeli weakness and claims that Israel is trying to pull the U.S. into an unnecessary war, the administration’s messaging is hitting a wall. Israel’s astounding success in devastating Hezbollah’s leadership and a large percentage of its massive arsenal of projectiles increased American support for Israeli victory. Whereas a few months ago, 'experts' scoffed at Netanyahu’s pledge to bring Israel 'Absolute Victory' in the war, now experts like Richard Dearlove, the former head of Britain’s MI6 spy agency, are saying that Israel is on the road to achieving just that. And so we come to Netanyahu’s day-after plan. Rebuffed by Biden-Harris, Netanyahu waited until after Israel turned the tide in the war to present his actual strategic vision for a post-war Middle East to the administration. He outlined it in two English-language video messages, first to the Iranian people and then to the Lebanese people. In both videos, he described how Iran and Hezbollah, respectively, have destroyed Iran and Lebanon. Israel, he explained to the Lebanese, has weakened Hezbollah sufficiently for the Lebanese people to rise up against it. In his words, 'We have degraded Hezbollah’s capabilities; we took out thousands of terrorists, including Nasrallah himself, and Nasrallah’s replacement, and the replacement of his replacement. Today, Hezbollah is weaker than it has been for many, many years. 'Now you, the Lebanese people, you stand at a significant crossroads. It is your choice. You can now take back your country.' He told the Iranians, 'You know one simple thing, Iran’s tyrants don’t care about your future. But you do.' He told the Iranian people that Iran will be freed from the regime 'a lot sooner than people think,' and presented them with a vision of peace after its fall. 'Our two countries, Israel and Iran, will be at peace. When that day comes, the terror network that the regime built in five continents will be bankrupt, dismantled. Iran will thrive as never before.' Netanyahu’s vision is the opposite of the Obama-Biden-Harris vision. And the American public supports it. This state of affairs limits the administration’s capacity to block Israel’s plans in relation to its much-vaunted retaliatory strike following Iran’s missile assault on Oct. 1. The Biden-Harris team’s efforts to bar Israel from attacking either Iran’s nuclear installations or its oil installations involve the familiar mix of contradictory messaging and political and strategic subversion that we have experienced from Democratic administrations since 2009. On the one hand, the U.S. supports Israel. On the other hand, the administration has flooded the media with its claims that Israel is too weak to take effective action, that its efforts are geared towards dragging the U.S. into a war, and that Iran poses no threat to anyone. All the same, Israel’s unexpected and demoralizing delays in carrying out its retaliatory attack on Iran raise fears that the administration is successfully blocking Israel from taking any strategically meaningful action against the regime. If that is in fact the case, the momentum Israel gained from its stunning intelligence operations and airstrikes against Hezbollah will be squandered. The conviction will resurface that Israel doesn’t have what it takes to win the war. While a source of anxiety, the prospect that Netanyahu will stand down now is minuscule. Israel’s momentum is too strong. Iranians and Lebanese, empowered by Israel’s achievement, are already echoing his messaging. The administration’s continued demands for immediate ceasefires and Israeli strategic reticence strike the average American and U.S. ally as irrational and out of step with events. While the shape of things to come is still unknowable, it is clear that Iran wasn’t the only party whose strategic goals were undermined by Israel’s seizure of the upper hand in this war. The Obama-Biden-Harris foreign policy establishment’s Iran-centric vision of the Middle East was also scuttled.

Iran recruited Israeli couple as assassination squad	Two Israelis arrested after allegedly being recruited by Tehran to carry out acts of sabotage and assassinations in Israel. By World Israel News Staff Israeli authorities announced Monday that they have uncovered an Iranian-led terrorist squad inside Israel, according to a joint statement released by the Shin Bet internal security agency and the Israel Police’s Lahav 433 anti-corruption unit. According to the Shin Bet and Israel Police, the Iranian-backed terrorist cell was run by two Israeli citizens from the central Israeli city of Ramat Gan. Both suspects have been arrested in connection with the plot. The primary suspect, Vladislav Viktorson, 30, was reportedly in contact with an individual using the alias 'Mari Hossi' on social media since August. The investigation revealed that Viktorson knowingly carried out various tasks under Iranian guidance. These included spray-painting graffiti, posting flyers, hiding funds, and setting vehicles on fire near Yarkon Park in Tel Aviv. Authorities reported that Viktorson later escalated his activities, following instructions to sabotage communications infrastructure, vandalize ATMs, and set forests on fire. For his efforts, he allegedly received over $5,000 in payments. Investigators also discovered that Viktorson had agreed to carry out an assassination of a public figure and to throw a grenade at a targeted residence. He subsequently sought weapons, including sniper rifles, pistols, and fragmentation grenades. In executing these assignments, Viktorson enlisted two accomplices, including his 18-year-old partner, Anna Bernstein, also from Ramat Gan. She is believed to have participated in some of the missions. Viktorson was also instructed to recruit homeless individuals for additional tasks and to document protestors at demonstrations. Both suspects have been indicted on security-related charges. The Shin Bet warned that social media platforms such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter are being exploited by Iranian intelligence to recruit Israelis. While the tasks may initially seem harmless, the agency warned that they could lead to severe national security threats. Recruitment efforts were conducted in multiple languages, including Hebrew and English, to lure participants with financial incentives. The statement noted that many Israelis who received suspicious approaches rejected them and reported the incidents to the relevant authorities. A senior Shin Bet official added that this investigation is part of a broader effort to dismantle Iranian intelligence networks targeting Israel. In recent months, several fake profiles linked to Iranian operatives have been identified, and further arrests have been made. The agency stressed that this case underscores ongoing Iranian attempts to exploit Israeli citizens for espionage and terrorism purposes.

Are Gazans getting tired of the war and Hamas rule?	Pockets of dissent have emerged among ordinary Palestinians fed up with Hamas thugs stealing humanitarian aid intended for their families. By Ben Cohen, JNS One year after the Hamas atrocities in southern Israel ignited a multi-front war between the Jewish state and Iran’s regional proxies, a discernible trend is emerging among many Palestinians, especially those in Gaza. They are getting tired of the war. War fatigue doesn’t mean that the Palestinians have suddenly developed an appetite for real peace—a peace, that is, in which Israel’s right to exist is welcomed, not contested, along with trade, educational and cultural agreements replacing boycotts, and a shared focus on regional security and regional development. The eliminationist ideology that resides at the heart of the Palestinian national movement, which expressed itself with astonishing brutality during the Oct. 7 pogrom in southern Israel, still prevails. But unlike the well-fed performative morons donning keffiyehs, banging drums and chanting antisemitic slogans in the streets and on the university campuses of Western cities, the Palestinians of Gaza have suffered immensely because of the actions of Hamas. Many of them are now asking whether it was all worth it. Indeed, throughout this year, pockets of dissent have emerged among ordinary Palestinians fed up with Hamas thugs stealing humanitarian aid intended for their families, with some of them rightly accusing the terrorist organization of not giving a damn about their welfare, given that a punishing response from Israel was never in doubt in the wake of the massacre of 1,200 people. A report from the Reuters news agency last week quoted a Gazan mother named Samira wistfully remembering what her life was like before Oct. 7. 'Despite all the hardships, our life was going well. We had jobs, houses and a city,' she said. Her dutiful description of Israel as 'our prime enemy' didn’t prevent her from blaming Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the atrocity, for inviting the Israeli response. 'What was he thinking? Didn’t he expect that Israel would destroy Gaza?' she asked. Sinwar did expect precisely that. It was, moreover, something that he wanted. The 'Butcher of Khan Yunis'—a moniker that Sinwar earned due to his reputation for torturing and murdering Palestinians opposed to Hamas—doubtless regards 'martyrdom' as a fitting end to his blood-drenched campaign. His Qatar-based billionaire comrade, Khaled Mashaal, thinks similarly, declaring in an interview last week that Hamas will 'rise like a phoenix' from the ashes of Gaza. That’s easy to say if you’re lounging at the Four Seasons in Doha wearing an expensive Italian suit. It’s not so easy if you’re a Gazan compelled to live with the consequences of Hamas’s pathology. Polling by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, a Ramallah-based institute that has usefully observed the shifting sentiments among Palestinians over the last year, bears that out. Its most recent survey, dated Sept. 14, reveals that for the first time, the majority of Gaza civilians—some 57%—now believe that the Oct. 7 atrocities were a mistake. Belief in the proposition that Hamas will still control Gaza at the end of the war has also declined, with 37% of Gazans agreeing with it compared with 70% of respondents in the West Bank. Also worth noting are the shifting opinions on a final settlement of the conflict. Some 39% of respondents support a two-state solution—a figure that rises to 59% when the phrase 'two-state solution' is not mentioned but the borders of a Palestinian state are defined by the armistice lines of 1949. Only 19% of respondents expressed support for an Israeli-Palestinian confederation, while just 10% backed the single state—'from the river to the sea'—that would entail the complete elimination of Israel. The latest mood of realism among Palestinians has been seen before, which is a good reason not to become overly optimistic. Given the heavy blows that have been sustained in the last year, with Hamas decimated as a cohesive fighting force and much of Gaza reduced to rubble, it isn’t surprising that more and more Palestinians are acknowledging that they have had enough. The shift may help secure a ceasefire and the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still languishing in Hamas captivity (although even then, as long as Sinwar calls the shots and ignores the pleas of his people, there is less likelihood of that outcome.) What it won’t do is bring about a peace where Israel is accepted by the Palestinians and the broader Arab world on its own terms. Israelis will correctly remain skeptical of reading too much into the changing mood. The idea of a democratic Jewish state with a permanent presence in the region still represents a red line that most Palestinians won’t cross. As the folksy observation has it, it’s one thing to think with your head, and another to feel with your heart. With Hamas on the ropes, with its Hezbollah ally in Lebanon humiliated and emasculated by Israel’s operations north of the border, and with Iran facing an Israeli counterattack that could yet bring an end to the regime of Ali Khamenei in Tehran—the ultimate source of all this suffering—a sensible head will conclude that the time is right for an interim deal. But eliminationism will continue to fester in Palestinian hearts unless and until it is properly addressed. It’s often said that the wholesale transformation of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan at the end of World War II was only possible because both of the regimes in those countries were unambiguously defeated. Looking at Palestinian politics now, we are very far from such a scenario. All the leaders and all the factions that predominate—Islamist or nationalist, Marwan Barghouti of Fatah or Yahya Sinwar of Hamas—are wedded to the idea that Zionism lies at the root of their ills. Whatever divides them, they are united in the belief that their 'liberation' can only be achieved at the expense of another state and another nation; essentially, a zero-sum game that determines for Palestine to live, Israel must die. I dare to hope, given the progress in the field in recent months, that Israel can significantly lessen, if not banish, the prospect of another Oct. 7. I dare not hope for much more than that.

IDF builds first sukkah in Gaza since 2005	This is the first sukkah built in Gaza since 2005 when 8000 Jews were removed forcibly from their homes. By JNS Israel Defense Forces soldiers have erected a sukkah in the Netzarim Corridor dividing northern and southern Gaza ahead of Sukkot, the Feast of Tabernacles, which starts on Wednesday, Hebrew media reported. It is the first time a sukkah has been built in Gaza since Israel disengaged from the enclave in 2005, forcibly removing some 8,000 Jews from their homes. During the weeklong Sukkot holiday, which this year starts at sundown on Oct. 16 and runs through Oct. 23, Jews erect festive booths across the Jewish state, in keeping with the biblical commandment of Leviticus 23:42-43 to 'dwell' in sukkot to remember the Exodus from Egypt. Amid the ongoing IDF campaigns against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon, the IDF Rabbinate is this year providing troops with a portable sukkah which meets all the requirements of Jewish law but can be quickly assembled and disassembled in the field. The Rabbinate also issued some 12,000 sets of the 'Four Species' that have been checked by rabbis to ensure that every soldier can fulfill the holiday ritual of Leviticus 23:40—a biblical commandment that involves waving a bundle of four plants (an etrog, or citron fruit; lulav, frond from a date palm; hadas, myrtle bough; and aravah, willow branch). The Sukkot holiday is immediately followed by Shemini Atzeret/Simchat Torah, which last year saw thousands of Hamas terrorists invade Israel, killing some 1,200 people, primarily Jews, while taking 251 captives to the Gaza Strip.

Forever 19 – Four IDF soldiers killed in UAV Hezbollah attack ide...	Sergeants Yoav Agmon, Alon Amitay, Yousef Hieb and Omri Tamari were all training to be Golani infantry soldiers. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The IDF has released for publication the names of the four soldiers killed in Hezbollah’s UAV attack Sunday on their Golani base near Binyamina. All four were 19-year-old infantry trainees who had just been inducted in August. They were all posthumously promoted to the rank of sergeant. Agmon was from Binyamina-Givat Ada. The IDF has informed his family of his death and expressed its profound sorrow over his loss. Amitay came from one of the founding families of an Upper Galilee moshav, Ramot Naftali that was evacuated in the beginning of the war. According to Israel Hayom, joining Golani was a family tradition Amitay proudly upheld, as many of his uncles enlisted in that venerable brigade. He had made it into the Sayeret, the elite commandos of the brigade, and was at the base because of a rocket-launcher course they were taking, his uncle said. 'He eagerly awaited the draft,' the uncle said. 'He wanted to be a combat soldier, and an officer like his mother, like his uncles. An amazing boy&#8230;who loved people. A special boy.' Although she has twin 12-year-old girls at home, his mother, Lieut. Col. Hagit, was called up for reserve duty on October 7 and has yet to be demobbed, serving continuously over the last year as commander of a multidimensional supply base in the Northern Command. Hieb was from the northern Bedouin town of Tuba-Zanghariya. As reported by Israel National News, he was killed just one week before the 33rd anniversary of his grandfather’s death in Lebanon. Warrant Officer Nayef Hieb had served for 17 years as an IDF tracker and was killed in 1991 when a roadside bomb exploded as his patrol vehicle passed by. The clans of Tuba-Zanghariya tied their fate to that of the Jewish people even prior to the state’s establishment, joining the Bedouin unit of the pre-state Palmach forces to fight the British who controlled what was then called Palestine. Tamari came from Mazkeret Batya, near Rehovot. One of the 58 soldiers wounded in the incident told Walla that Tamari had been a person whose 'quietness characterized him. He always volunteered to pick up equipment,' but without fanfare. 'He was extremely humble – I have never seen such modesty in a person in my life. He had a pure heart, he never complained in life.' He was also was 'good at everything,' the friend said. 'He was in first place in the fitness tests&#8230; He was supposed to go to officers’ training in November, he wanted to move forward in life.' A battle fitness group Tamari had trained with for two and a half years to prepare himself for the army mourned him as 'a quiet leader, an introvert, smart, an athlete and principled' who had spent a post-high school year in a volunteering program due to 'his love of the country and desire to contribute to it.'

DNA test reveals Columbus’ secret Jewish heritage	The results of a 22-year-long investigation by forensic scientists was revealed in a documentary on Spain’s National Day. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A documentary aired Saturday in Spain revealed that exhaustive DNA testing suggests that explorer Christopher Columbus was a Sephardic Jew from Spain, and not a native of Italy of non-Jewish ancestry as traditionally believed. The show, entitled 'Columbus DNA: His True Origin,' summarized a 22-year-long investigation by forensic scientists who tested tiny samples of the explorer’s remains, which are buried the Seville Cathedral, as well as samples from his known relatives. Prof. José Antonio Lorente of Granada University, who co-led the research team, called the conclusion as 'almost absolutely reliable.' 'We have DNA from Christopher Columbus, very partial, but sufficient,' he said in the show. 'We have DNA from Hernando Colón, his son. And both in the Y chromosome (male) and in the mitochondrial DNA (transmitted by the mother) of Hernando there are traits compatible with Jewish origin.' The findings refute a belief long held by many historians that Columbus was of non-Jewish ancestry from Genoa, Italy. Columbus began his explorations for the Spanish monarchy in the 1490’s, a period well known in Jewish history as that of the Expulsion, when King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella ordered that all Jews in their realm had to either convert or leave the country. Over the course of a century of persecution that concluded with what became known as the Alhambra Decree, more than 200,000 Jews - over half of Spain’s Jewish population – became Catholics. In 1492, 40,000-100,000 were expelled. Also in 1492, in the first of his four sea expeditions, Columbus left Castile in August with three ships and made landfall in the Americas, specifically in the Bahamas, on October 12. In the same trip he also discovered Cuba and Haiti. In his later trips he discovered South America and Central America. He named the native people he found 'Indios,' or Indians, because of his mistaken belief that he had reached the Asian continent. Columbus himself identified as a Christian, and his personal writings attest not only to his dedication to his faith, but to his desire to bring all others to believe in Christianity as well. According to the National Christopher Columbus Association, 'Columbus saw himself as a man especially chosen by God for a mission – not just to discover a new route to the Indies, or even new lands, but by that to make possible the spread of the Faith to all.' The documentary was appropriately released on Spain's National Day, which commemorates Columbus's arrival in the New World.

IDF denies it has ended bombings of Beirut over US pressure	Netanyahu reportedly instructed Israeli military not to strike Beirut, following phone call with President Biden. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A senior Israeli official denied Monday that the IDF has avoided striking at Hezbollah targets in Lebanon's capital due to pressure from President Joe Biden on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Last Wednesday, Biden and Netanyahu spoke on the phone, the first direct contact between the two leaders in six weeks. According to a report by Yedioth Aharanoth, Biden demanded Netanyahu sharply cut back the number of airstrikes in populated areas, in particular Beirut, where the Iran-backed Hezbollah terror organization's headquarters are located. While a pair of airstrikes targeting senior Hezbollah operative Wafiq Safa were carried out in Beirut's Dahieh neighborhood last Thursday, since then, no strikes have been reported in the Lebanese capital. According to Lebanon's health ministry, 18 people were killed in the two strikes Thursday, with 92 others injured. Israel's public broadcaster, Kan, also reported over the weekend that the IDF had been ordered to halt airstrikes against Hezbollah positions in Beirut. On Monday, however, a senior Israeli official pushed back against the reports, saying that the IDF was not restricted in its attacks against terrorists in Lebanon, adding that the Israel Air Force would strike in Beirut again within the next few days. 'Israel attacks everywhere in Lebanon, including Beirut. We proved this recently, and we will prove it again in the coming days, in accordance with operational considerations,' the official said, according to a report by The Times of Israel. President Biden on Friday said his administration is 'absolutely, positively' urging Israel to avoid airstrikes in areas where United Nations peacekeepers are currently deployed. The comments came after five peacekeepers from the United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon (UNIFIL) were injured in several IDF airstrikes last week, including on conducted to provide cover for the evacuation of wounded IDF soldiers.

Netanyahu spars with UN Secretary-General over peacekeepers in Le...	UN peacekeepers have become hostages of Hezbollah,' says Netanyahu, urging UN to evacuate its forces, even as UN Secretary-General insists UNIFIL will remain in Lebanon. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged the United Nations Sunday to withdraw its peacekeeping force from southern Lebanon as fighting continues between Israel and the Hezbollah terrorist organization. In a statement issued Sunday afternoon, the Israeli premier called on United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to evacuate the roughly 9,500 soldiers deployed to southern Lebanon as part of the United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon (UNIFIL). Formed in 1978, UNIFIL has since been tasked with monitoring the Israeli-Lebanese frontier, disarming Hezbollah, and aiding the Lebanese government to maintain control over the land between the Blue Line and the Litani River. Amid escalations in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, however, Israel has urged UNIFIL to evacuate, saying that Hezbollah terrorists have been effectively using the peacekeepers as human shields by intentionally operating in close proximity to UNIFIL positions to minimize the likelihood of an Israeli airstrike. At least five UNIFIL peacekeepers were injured in IDF strikes last week, including one launched to cover the evacuation of injured IDF soldiers. 'I would like to appeal directly to the UN Secretary General: The time has come for you to withdraw UNIFIL from Hezbollah strongholds and from the combat zones,' Netanyahu said. 'The IDF has requested this repeatedly and has met with repeated refusal, which has the effect of providing Hezbollah terrorists with human shields. Your refusal to evacuate UNIFIL soldiers has turned them into hostages of Hezbollah. This endangers both them and the lives of our soldiers.' 'We regret the harm to UNIFIL soldiers and we are doing our utmost to prevent such harm. But the simplest and most obvious way to ensure this is simply to withdraw them from the danger zone.' Guterres rejected the appeal, with a spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, vowing that the UN peacekeeping force would remain in place. 'Peacekeepers remain in all positions and the UN flag continues to fly' Dujarric said 'The Secretary-General reiterates that the safety and security of UN personnel and property must be guaranteed and that the inviolability of UN premises must be respected at all times.'

Iran threatens US: ‘Don’t defend Israel, we have no red lines’	Iran seems particularly concerned about the U.S. deploying the THAAD anti-ballistic missile advanced air defense system to Israel. By World Israel News Staff As Iran girds for an expected Israeli retaliatory strike following Tehran's unprecedented launch of some 200 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State, an Iranian official warned Washington against helping defend Israel. 'The US has been delivering record amount of arms to Israel. It is now also putting lives of its troops at risk by deploying them to operate US missile systems in Israel,' wrote Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi on his official X account on Sunday. 'While we have made tremendous efforts in recent days to contain an all-out war in our region, I say it clearly that we have no red lines in defending our people and interests,' he added. Fears in Iran are growing that Israel is gearing up to strike the country's nuclear facilities or oil assets, though some media reports have suggested that Israel will avoid those sensitive targets. CNN reported that Iran's leadership are 'extremely nervous' about the Israeli retaliation, which could also potentially see the assassinations of senior officials, such as the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini. Iran seems particularly concerned about the U.S. deploying the THAAD anti-ballistic missile advanced air defense system to Israel. It's likely that Tehran in planning to respond to an Israeli strike with yet another barrage of ballistic missiles, and the use of THAAD would likely greatly limit the efficacy of such an attack. Saudi outlet Ashaq Al-Awsat recently reported that Iran is prepared to ignore a 'limited' Israeli strike, but that attacks on its nuclear or oil facilities would be crossing a 'red line.' The report indicated that Iran's message to Israel is that it will turn a blind eye to a minor strike, and will not respond despite its repeated threats to do so. However, damage to Iran's oil or nuclear assets would necessitate a forceful response, the outlet reported Iran as telling Israel through third parties.

US confirms deployment of troops, air defense system to Israel	100 U.S. soldiers to operate advanced anti-ballistic missile system on Israel soil, ahead of potential Iranian attack. By World Israel News Staff The U.S. officially confirmed that it will transfer an advanced anti-ballistic missile air defense system to Israel, as well as deploy some 100 American troops to the Jewish State in order to operate the system. 'At the direction of the President, Secretary Austin authorized the deployment of a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery and associated crew of U.S. military personnel to Israel to help bolster Israel's air defenses following Iran's unprecedented attacks against Israel on April 13 and again on October 1,' read a media statement attributed to Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder. 'This action underscores the United States’ ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel, and to defend Americans in Israel, from any further ballistic missile attacks by Iran,' Ryder added. 'It is part of the broader adjustments the U.S. military has made in recent months, to support the defense of Israel and protect Americans from attacks by Iran and Iranian-aligned militias.' The statement noted that this is not the first time that the U.S. has authorized the use of THAAD in the region, referencing a joint exercise between the U.S. and Israel in 2019 during which the system was activated. More recently, the U.S. deployed a THAAD to the Middle East immediately following the October 7th Hamas onslaught, though the statement did not specify exactly where the system had been transferred. According to a Ynet report, the THAAD placed in Israel will be able to receive critical information from other THAAD systems in the region, including in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The decision to provide Israel with THAAD may indicate that Washington is anticipating a major Israeli strike on Iran, which would be met with significant retaliation by the Islamic Republic. On October 1st, Tehran launched some 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, in what is believed to be one of the largest aerial attacks of its kind in history.

Former Lebanese PM accuses Hezbollah of ‘hijacking ‘ his country,...	It is known without any doubt,' Siniora said. 'Hezbollah initiated this war, just as they did in 2006.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Former Prime Minister of Lebanon, Fouad Siniora, laid the blame for the recent conflict at the feet of Hezbollah who has 'hijacked' and 'destroyed' his country along with Iran, which Siniora feels should 'stay out' of Lebanon's affairs. Siniora, who was premier during the Second Lebanon War in 2006, had harsh words for Israel regarding civilian deaths in Gaza and Lebanon but mainly blamed the war on Hezbollah, which he thought had a ruinous effect on his country. Speaking to Sky News on Saturday, Siniora blamed the terror group for the war. 'It is known without any doubt,' Siniora said. 'Hezbollah initiated this war, just as they did in 2006. I don't deny that Israel harbors bad intentions toward the country, but Hezbollah started the conflict both then and now.' 'You cannot rule a country when you have two states: the state of Hezbollah, which runs things through its power, and the actual state of Lebanon, whose authority has diminished,' he explained. 'This is an opportunity for the Lebanese state to reclaim its authority. With Hezbollah weakened, we must seize the moment to bring the country back to proper governance. If we continue to be hijacked by Hezbollah, there will be no future for the Lebanese people,' he warned. Siniora also strongly criticized Iran for backing and strengthening Hezbollah and urged the Islamic Republic to stay out of Lebanon's affairs. 'By all means, Iran's presence has been spoiling the country. It has interfered with Hezbollah and others, leading us to this situation. Lebanon cannot afford to let Iran continue to meddle, not only directly but through its tentacles in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and beyond,' he said. With the bombardments and the displacement of civilians, Siniora despairs that Iran and Hezbollah are ruining the country, which is fast becoming a 'total failure.' He cautioned,' If we don't take the proper steps to stop this crisis, Lebanon will fail. 'Let me be clear: Lebanon is already a failed state, but there is always a way to save it.'

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The IDF recently eliminated 100 Hezbollah terrorists and has dismantled tunnels and other Hezbollah infrastructure in Lebanon. Soldiers of the 146th Reserve Division targeted Hezbollah's underground infrastructure and their massive tunnel system. Many of the battles fought by the IDF have taken place on rough, mountainous terrain above the underground network as well as areas the Iran-backed terror group used to launch missiles into Israel. In recent raids, 50 Hezbollah rocket launchers and 60 Hezbollah command posts were neutralized. Soldiers of the 205th Brigade unveiled tunnels 120 kilometers long and two meters deep located half a mile from the border. The tunnels were intended for extended use, as indicated by electrical infrastructure, ventilation ducts, and rooms used for storing ammunition. Following a situational assessment, the Commander of the Northern Command and the head of IDF intelligence said, 'The activity of the IDF and creating a situation by which northern residents could return to their homes.' In one case, troops discovered that Hezbollah's tunnels were only a few meters from a UNFIL watchtower. United States Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told his Israeli counterpart Saturday night that the time has come for Israel to 'pivot' from its military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon to a diplomatic approach. Speaking with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant Saturday night, Austin 'expressed his deep concern about reports that Israeli forces fired on UN peacekeeping positions in Lebanon as well as by the reported death of two Lebanese soldiers,' Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said. Austin also emphasized 'the need to pivot from military operations in Lebanon to a diplomatic pathway as soon as feasible.' The two spoke a day after several peacekeepers from the United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon were injured in an Israeli airstrike that targeted a Hezbollah position in southern Lebanon. In the past week, five UNIFIL peacekeepers have been injured in IDF airstrikes, leading to protests from 40 countries that contribute soldiers to the international force. Gallant defended the Israeli airstrikes, noting that Hezbollah terrorists regularly position themselves near UNIFIL observation posts and bases intentionally, adding that Israel takes steps to avoid hitting UN peacekeepers. 'Hezbollah operates and fires in the vicinity of UNIFIL positions, using peacekeeping missions as a cover for its terrorist activities,' an Israeli Defense Ministry spokesperson said in a statement Sunday morning.

Massive casualties: 4 IDF soldiers killed, dozens wounded in Hezb...	No sirens were sounded during the attack, and the IDF is currently investigating. By World Israel News Four Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers lost their lives and seven others sustained severe injuries when a drone detonated in Binyamina, 25 miles southeast of Haifa, on Sunday night. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), launched by the Hezbollah terror group, struck the dining hall of the Golani Brigade’s training base while dozens of soldiers were gathered inside. In total, 51 soldiers were wounded, with nine suffering moderate injuries, while the remainder were lightly injured. All those affected have been transported to medical facilities, and their families have been informed. The IDF issued a statement saying, 'The circumstances of the incident are under investigation. Our hearts go out to the families who have lost their loved ones, and we will continue to support them through this difficult time.' Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel’s national emergency medical service, later confirmed that they had treated 61 individuals, including three in critical condition, 18 moderately injured, and 31 with minor injuries. An additional nine people were treated for shock. 'We asked for the army to help by providing helicopters, and some of the wounded will be evacuated to the hospitals in the center of the country,' MDA director-general Eli Bin told local media, adding that medics were still searching the area for additional victims of the attack. Rescue teams responded quickly to the scene, providing medical assistance to the wounded and transferring some to hospitals in central Israel via airlift. United Hatzalah said its volunteer first responders were 'providing initial treatment to a large number of injured at the scene of an incident in the Binyamina region.' It was not immediately clear where the drone came from. According to Israel’s Channel 12 News, two drones approached Israeli territory from the sea. While one was shot down, the second was not intercepted due to its apparent low altitude. No sirens were activated prior to the attack.

‘Hamas earned at least $500,000 on humanitarian aid’: Why Israeli...	Hamas continues to take control of at least 50 percent of all the humanitarian aid that enters Gaza. By Anna Epshtein, TPS As Israeli forces continue pressing a new offensive against Hamas in Jabaliya, experts said the fighting was the only way to ensure Hamas does not re-establish itself in northern Gaza. While soldiers also returned to the nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, the bulk of the fighting appeared to be taking place in Jabaliya. Analysts told The Press Service of Israel that the terror group continues seizing humanitarian aid intended for the Gaza residents, using it for its own needs and selling the remains to civilians at high prices. ‘There were reports about a month ago that Hamas has earned as much as $500,000 by selling the humanitarian aid it looted from the international organizations. With this money, it pays salaries to its remaining members and manages to mobilize new ones,’ Professor Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies and a senior fellow at the Misgav Institute for National Security, told TPS-IL. According to Michael, Hamas continues to take control of at least 50 percent of all the humanitarian aid that enters Gaza. 'The trucks with humanitarian aid are inspected by Israel before they enter the Gaza Strip. Once they are on the other side of the fence, they are supposed to be taken over by international organizations that distribute the aid. But these organizations are not able to manage the enormous amount of aid that is being sent to Gaza,' Michael explained. 'Lots of trucks are being looted by Hamas even before they get into the hands of humanitarian organizations. The army recorded a conversation of two Hamas operatives in which they were complaining their warehouses are so full they don’t have where to store the aid – this is the extent of the problem,' he said. TPS-IL reported previously that despite Gaza’s widespread devastation, Hamas continues paying salaries to its gunmen and civil servants – partly through taxing and diverting humanitarian aid and distributing food vouchers — with the help of clans, criminal groups and so-called 'People’s Committees.' 'It’s a strategic failure of the IDF that it refused to take control over the aid distribution, and the strategic failure of the international community which insists on delivering humanitarian aid to zones of the Strip where the IDF had ordered the civilians to evacuate,’ says Gabi Siboni, a colonel in the IDF reserve service and a senior research fellow at the Misgav Institute for National Security. When Hamas slashed food prices in April, Gaza residents told TPS-IL that the problem wasn’t a lack of food but a shortage of money for families to purchase it. According to Siboni, humanitarian aid should not at all be heading towards the north of the Strip, where the IDF ordered the civilians to evacuate to the south. Said Michael, ‘The IDF should handle the distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza from the border to the distribution centers inside the Strip, and international organizations could handle it from there. Each time the army leaves the area, Hamas manages to regroup. I think the IDF has learned the lesson, and it won’t happen again.' At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

By David Isaac, JNS U.S. Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris mingled with an Iranian regime operative, Mohammad Ali Elahi, who has praised Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, as 'the leader who led the greatest revolution in the history of Islam.'

It described Fadlallah as 'the voice of wisdom, moderation, peace, justice, freedom, human unity and dignity.' A CBN television report in 2007 showed Elahi meeting with Fadlallah. Elahi told CBN, 'We need to have another interview talking about whether Hezbollah is a terrorist organization or not. I know that legally in the U.S. now, Hezbollah is on that list. … They [Hezbollah] were resisting against [Israeli] occupation. I think that is something that is supported even with our government.' 'Aside from al-Qaeda, no terrorist group has killed more Americans than Hezbollah,' CBN noted. In 1995, Elahi was quoted by The Arab American News saying, 'If my blood would help the liberation of Lebanon, I would give my blood to liberate Lebanon.' The report detailed Elahi’s positions, which toe Tehran’s line, such as referring to the U.S. killing of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps leader Gen. Qasem Soleimani as a political assassination, and describing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as 'a Hitler of our century.' 'The war that Netanyahu and his terrorist cult have started against Lebanon will never succeed,' Elahi said in September as Israel killed Hezbollah leaders. 'I hope to see Netanyahu and his criminal cabinet in jail soon. And if they escape justice in this world, for sure they won’t escape the hell next.' Elahi has also cast doubt on al-Qaeda’s role in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Elahi, who was born in Iran, has close personal ties to the Islamic regime. According to a CIA report, he served as head of the Iranian Navy’s political-ideological office in 1982. Images taken from his social media networks, some of which are included in George Washington University’s report, show Elahi meeting with major Iranian political figures, including Khomeini and then-Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. The report said Elahi is the 'only identifiable American member' of the Ahlul Bayt World Assembly (ABWA), a group established in 1994 by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to export the Islamic Republic’s revolutionary ideas to non-Iranian Shi’ite and Sunni communities. Elahi’s aforementioned Islamic House of Wisdom is a beneficiary of the New York-based Alavi Foundation aid program, a U.S. nonprofit, described in the reports as 'arguably the most prolific actor in the spread of Iranian regime influence in the United States.' Elahi’s group received $500,000 from Alavi since 2010. The Department of Justice accused Alavi in 2008 of secretly serving 'as a front for the Iranian government and as a gateway for millions of dollars to be funneled to Iran in clear violation of U.S. sanctions laws.' Alavi was found guilty in U.S. court in 2017, but the ruling was overturned over procedural errors. The legal battle is ongoing, the report said. In April 2010, Alavi’s president, Farshid Jahedi, was arrested and sentenced to three months in prison for obstruction of justice. He was caught destroying documents while under surveillance.

Trump demands presidential-level protection over Iranian death th...	In battleground states, campaign staff are quietly negotiating for enhanced safety measures, including expanded no-fly zones and bullet-resistant barriers. By Jewish Breaking News Shaken by two narrowly prevented assassination attempts and Iranian death threats, Donald Trump’s campaign is pushing for heightened security measures to protect their candidate at least until November 5th. According to the New York Times, Trump’s top advisors have contacted White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe to request military support, such as aircraft and armored vehicles typically reserved for sitting presidents in high-risk situations. With less than a month until election day, the Trump team finds itself in a precarious balancing act. Rally schedules are in flux, with some events cancelled outright due to security concerns. In battleground states, campaign staff are quietly negotiating for enhanced safety measures, including expanded no-fly zones and bullet-resistant barriers. Intelligence sources point to Iran as a primary threat, with officials now acknowledging that Tehran’s determination to retaliate for the 2020 killing of General Qasem Soleimani has reached alarming levels. However, Trump’s campaign has complained that the White House has downplayed these very real death threats. 'This administration spends more time focused on a hack of emails than they do on the Iranians who are trying to kill Donald Trump,' Trump campaign spokesperson Chris LaCivita told reporters in Pennsylvania last weekend. Trump’s spokesperson also blasted Biden’s weak response to foreign threats, recalling how Bill Clinton unleashed cruise missiles when Saddam Hussein plotted to assassinate George H.W. Bush in 1993. 'All they do is put out a press release,' LaCivita noted. Addressing concerns about Trump’s safety on Friday, National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett confirmed that Biden has been 'closely tracking' Iranian threats against the former president. 'We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority, and we strongly condemn Iran for these brazen threats,' Savett stated. 'Should Iran attack any of our citizens, including those who continue to serve the United States or those who formerly served, Iran will face severe consequences.'

39 wounded in Hezbollah drone attack in northern Israel	No sirens were sounded during the attack, and the IDF is currently investigating it. By JNS and World Israel News Over 20 people were wounded, three critically, 5 severely wounded, and 14 others are in moderate condition, when a drone struck the Binyamina area in northern Israel on Sunday night, according to medics. No sirens were sounded during the attack, and the IDF is currently investigating it. The wounded were evacuated by helicopter to Tel Hashomer, Rambam and other hospitals around the country. United Hatzalah said its volunteers were 'providing initial treatment to a large number of injured (over 20) at the scene of an incident in the Binyamina region. Some are in serious condition.'

Iran’s missile attack caused over $40 million in damage to Israel	Approximately 1,000 of the claims were made in Hod HaSharon in central Israel. By Pesach Benson, TPS Iran’s ballistic missile barrage on Oct. 1 caused an estimated 150-200 million shekels ($39-$53 million) in damage, the Israel Tax Authority reported in an initial assessment released on Sunday. The Authority reported that around 2,500 compensation claims were filed with the government. Around 2,200 of those claims were for apartment buildings damaged during the attack. Approximately 1,000 of the claims were made in Hod HaSharon in central Israel. Another 50 million shekels ($13 million) were caused to a luxury complex on the northern Tel Aviv beachfront. Residents had gone to the shelters and no injuries were reported. Iran fired more than 180 missiles, claiming it was in response for the assassinations of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July and Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut in September. One Palestinian in the Jericho area was killed by falling debris from a missile interception while a 68-year-old Israeli man in Afula died of stress after entering a safe room. Israeli leaders have vowed to retaliate but have not indicated when, or what their targets would be. According to Israeli media reports, the US is considering deploying Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries to bolster Israel’s air defenses against an Iranian counter-attack.

INSURRECTION ALERT: Dems lay groundwork to delegitimize election ...	Democrats are refusing to say—unequivocally—that they would certify the election results if their candidate doesn't win. By Andrew Stiles, The Washington Free Beacon Democrats are preparing to challenge the legitimacy of the 2024 election. Some have refused to fully commit to certifying the results if Donald Trump wins. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, challenged Trump's victory in 2016. He told Axios that Democrats would certify the results, but only if the election was 'free, fair, and honest.' And if Trump wins, Raskin said he 'definitely' would have doubts about the fairness of the contest. Rep. Jim McGovern (D., Mass.), the ranking Democrat on the House Rules Committee, also raised objections following the 2016 election. He said Democrats would certify a Trump win 'assuming everything goes the way we expect it to. &#8230; We have to see how it all happens.' Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D., Ill.), a senior Democrat who challenged the results of George W. Bush's reelection victory in 2004, said she is worried about the 'shenanigans [Trump] is planning,' and wants to 'make sure that all the rules have been followed' before committing to certify the results. This is a dangerous assault on America's democracy. Democrats are refusing to say—unequivocally—that they would certify the election results if their candidate doesn't win. The message to their supporters, including the violent left-wing activists rioting on college campuses, is clear: The election will only be legitimate if Donald Trump loses. There's no telling how these radical agitators might respond if Trump wins and they believe the election was stolen. Democrats have a long history of refusing to accept the results of legitimate elections when they lose. Hillary Clinton still believes she was the rightful winner of the 2016 election and Trump was an 'illegitimate president.' Stacey Abrams has repeatedly claimed that she 'won' the 2018 gubernatorial election in Georgia. (She did not.) Before he dropped out of the race this summer, President Joe Biden challenged the accuracy of polls that showed him losing to Trump, laying the groundwork to challenge the results, by insurrection if necessary.

US Defense Secretary pressures Israel to end war in Lebanon	Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin tells Israeli defense chief the time has come to ‘pivot from military operations in Lebanon to a diplomatic pathway,’ after UN peacekeepers injured in Israeli airstrikes. By World Israel News Staff United States Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told his Israeli counterpart Saturday night that the time has come for Israel to 'pivot' from its military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon to a diplomatic approach. Speaking with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant Saturday night, Austin 'expressed his deep concern about reports that Israeli forces fired on UN peacekeeping positions in Lebanon as well as by the reported death of two Lebanese soldiers,' Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said. Austin also emphasized 'the need to pivot from military operations in Lebanon to a diplomatic pathway as soon as feasible.' The two spoke a day after several peacekeepers from the United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon were injured in an Israeli airstrike which targeted a Hezbollah position in southern Lebanon. In the past week, five UNIFIL peacekeepers have been injured in IDF airstrikes, leading to protests from 40 countries which contribute soldiers to the international force. Gallant defended the Israeli airstrikes, noting that Hezbollah terrorists regularly position themselves near UNIFIL observation posts and bases intentionally, adding that Israel takes steps to avoid hitting UN peacekeepers. 'Hezbollah operates and fires in the vicinity of UNIFIL positions, using peacekeeping missions as a cover for its terrorist activities,' an Israeli Defense Ministry spokesperson said in a statement Sunday morning. 'Gallant emphasized that while facing this significant operational challenge, the IDF will continue to take measures to avoid harm to UNIFIL troops and peacekeeping positions.' The Israeli defense chief said the IDF would continue to operate in southern Lebanon with the aim of dismantling Hezbollah’s attack infrastructure in pursuit of the goal of ensuring the safe return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes. During the call, the two also discussed ongoing defensive activities in the face of threats posed by Iran and its proxies, primarily Iranian militias in Yemen, Syria and Iraq.

Hamas documents reveal plans for 9/11-style attacks on Tel Aviv –...	The Gazan terrorists sent Iran many attack ideas, after asking for hundreds of millions of dollars in extra funding in 2021. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Secret Hamas documents found by the IDF on computers confiscated in Gaza detailed how the terror organization planned to strike Israel, including by copying the Al Qaeda attack on New York’s Twin Towers, The Washington Post reported Saturday. The paper said it gained access to 59 Hamas letters and computer documents that Israeli forces had found in the Gaza Strip earlier in the war which revealed that ideas for the October 7 attack on southern Israel had begun percolating at least since 2021. The trove included missives Hamas head Yahya Sinwar sent to Tehran that year asking for hundreds of millions of dollars for training 12,000 more fighters, in which he promised that if he received this aid he could 'destroy Israel completely in two years,' the report said. Among the plans the report described was a slide presentation from late 2022 one sent to the mullahs that included the idea to commit a 9/11-style attack as part of a many-pronged assault. The Azrieli Center, they suggested, is close to IDF headquarters, which could be destroyed if the tallest of the trio of Tel Aviv skyscrapers fell, thereby hitting two high-value targets at once. Another suggested target was the 70-floor Moshe Aviv tower in the Ramat Gan diamond district. A different plan was to detonate a fuel-carrying train inside an Israeli city, or using the rail lines to bring fighters and bombs into major cities. While they admitted these proposals were only in the initial stages, they said that they do have 'a mechanism that works' to use fishing boats to speed bombs and armed men into Israeli ports. A completely low-tech idea was presented as well, complete with pictures and descriptions: Constructing horse-pulled chariots that could hold two fighters and a driver, which would be a 'fast and light mechanism' that would also be much quieter and therefore be of greater surprise to Israeli forces. While the October 7 attack did not feature any of these elements, there were also detailed photos of Israeli military bases that could be invaded and schematics of terror attacks that were indeed implemented, at least in part. The slide presentation boasted that Hamas had managed to gather over 17,000 photos of strategic value, including satellite photos, and each idea was accompanied by pictures of the relevant targets. The New York Times reported Saturday on another part of the intelligence haul the IDF had procured in Gaza – the minutes of ten meetings top Hamas officials, including ones with Hamas head Yahya Sinwar, had both internally and with Hezbollah and Iranian officials. The Gazan terrorists even delayed the attack for a year, from the High Holiday period of 2022 to 2023, the report said, while attempting to convince the mullahs to help attack Israel directly, either during or immediately following their invasion of Israel. Iran has always denied knowing about the planned attacks, and did so again Saturday, through their UN Mission. 'All the planning, decision-making and directing were solely executed by Hamas’s military wing based in Gaza. Any claim attempting to link it to Iran or Hezbollah — either partially or wholly — is devoid of credence and comes from fabricated documents,' it said. Hamas ultimately went it alone, the NYT report said, with one of their reasons being their fear of a new laser weapon that Israel had announced they had successfully tested in June, which could intercept rockets, mortar shells, drones and anti-tank missiles for a fraction of the cost of the physical Iron Dome rockets.

Biden raps Israel after UN peacekeepers injured in IDF airstrikes	Dozens of countries criticize IDF after UN peacekeepers injured in Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon; Israel says Hezbollah terrorists hiding near UN positions. By World Israel News Staff The U.S. joined dozens of other nations in criticizing Israel over its air campaign against Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon, after a number of United Nations peacekeepers were injured in IDF airstrikes. Five members of the United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon (UNIFIL) mission have been injured over the past week, including two who were injured in an Israeli airstrike Friday on a Hezbollah position in Naquora. Israel has defended its actions, saying Hezbollah terrorists have intentionally operated near UNIFIL positions to discourage Israeli attacks, adding that the IDF makes every effort to avoid harming UNIFIL peacekeepers while still striking Hezbollah positions. But at least 40 countries which have contributed soldiers to the international force condemned Israel over the weekend, demanding the IDF halt its airstrikes. 'We consider UNIFIL’s role as particularly crucial in the light of the escalating situation in the region,' the joint statement read. 'We therefore strongly condemn recent attacks on the UNIFIL peacekeepers. Such actions must stop immediately and should be adequately investigated.' President Joe Biden on Friday said his administration was calling on Israel to refrain from attacks which could hit UNIFIL peacekeepers. 'Are you asking Israel to stop hitting U.N. peacekeepers?' one reporter asked the president. 'Absolutely, positively,' Biden responded. In a separate statement by France, Italy, and Spain, the three largest European contributors of soldiers to UNIFIL expressed 'outrage' at the Israeli airstrikes. 'These attacks constitute a serious violation of the obligations of Israel under UNSCR 1701 and under humanitarian international law,' the three countries said in a statement. 'We recall that all peacekeepers must be protected and reiterate our praise for the continued and indispensable commitment of UNIFIL troops/personnel in this very challenging context.' France, Italy, and Spain further called for an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon. First established in 1978 following Israel’s Operation Litani in southern Lebanon, UNIFIL is comprised of nearly 10,000 peacekeepers from 46 different countries. The organization’s mandate, which has been amended repeatedly since the force’s formation, includes maintaining stability along the Israel-Lebanese border, ensuring the demilitarization of the Hezbollah terrorist organization, preventing cross-border smuggling, and bolstering Lebanese government control over southern Lebanon. Israel has argued that UNIFIL has failed to fulfill its mandated mission of ensuring the disarmament of Hezbollah, as required in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, passed to end the Second Lebanon War in 2006.

Israel to seize UNRWA headquarters in Jerusalem, convert it into ...	With the Knesset on the verge of banning UNRWA's operations in Israel, government seizes UN agency's headquarters in Jerusalem, prepares to repurpose complex to serve as housing units. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli government is poised to seize a Jerusalem complex used for decades as the headquarters of a United Nations agency now accused of employing terrorists who took part in the October 7th atrocities in southwestern Israel. Last week, the Israel Land Authority (ILA), revealed on its website that it is planning to expropriate the Jerusalem headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), located near the Ma'alot Dafna neighborhood, straddling the pre-1967 boundary which divided Jerusalem between east and west from 1949 to 1967. According to the ILA's website, the complex will be repurposed into housing units, with 1,440 apartments to be built on the property. UNRWA's Jerusalem headquarters have been the target of demonstrations protesting the agency's activities, particularly after the revelations of links between UNRWA and Gaza terror groups including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. IDF Maj. Shay Rosengarten, chairman of the Im Tirtzu activist group which lobbied for the banning of UNRWA in Israel, said: 'Congratulations to ILA for the quick action.' 'The UNRWA employees who were involved in the October 7th massacre must be punished in the most severe manner, the rest deported. A commemorative museum for the terrible Simchat Torah massacre should be established in the new complex. We thank our thousands of activists who demanded the removal of UNRWA from Jerusalem!' Last week, the Knesset approved the first reading of a bill which, if passed, would severely curtail UNRWA's ability to operate in Israel. The law is expected to go up for its final votes at the opening of the Knesset's winter session. Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of UNRWA, warned against final passage of the bill. 'Legislation to end our operations is ready for final adoption by the Israeli Knesset. It seeks to ban UNRWA's presence and operations in the territory of Israel, revoking its privileges and immunities, in violation of international law. If the bills are adopted, the consequences will be severe.' 'Operationally, the entire humanitarian response in Gaza – which rests on UNRWA's infrastructure – may disintegrate' The post Israel to seize UNRWA headquarters in Jerusalem, convert it into apartments appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/israel-to-seize-unrwa-headquarters-in-jerusalem-convert-it-into-apartments/	2024-10-13T04:00:37-07:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/F240313ALA05_pr.jpg
Bill Maher schools pop singer over anti-Israel rant	Comedian Bill Maher takes aim at Gen Z musical icon Chappell Roan after she accused Democrats of 'failing' Palestine with 'genocidal views.' By World Israel News Staff Comedian Bill Maher chided a pop singer Friday over her recent TikTok rant in which she accused the Democratic Party of holding 'genocidal' views which have 'failed' Palestine. On September 25th, Kayleigh Rose Amstutz - a 26-year-old synth-pop singer better known by her stage name, Chappel Roan - posted a video statement to TikTok, defending her decision not to endorse a candidate for the upcoming presidential election. Castigating Donald Trump and pledging to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris, Roan nevertheless declined to endorse the Democratic candidate, noting her disappointment with the party and the policies of the Biden-Harris administration. 'Like, obviously, f*** the policies of the Right, but also, f*** some of the policies on the Left,' said Roan. 'That's why I can't endorse.' 'There is no way I can stand behind some of the Left completely transphobic and completely genocidal views.' 'F*** Trump for real, but f*** some of the sh** that has gone down in the Democratic Party that has failed people like me and you and more so Palestine and more so every marginalized community in the world.' On Friday, Maher responded to Roan's comments, dedicating his 'New Rule' segment on his 'Real Time With Bill Maher' show to rebutting them. The 68-year-old liberal comedian and political satirist mocked Roan's understanding of Middle East politics, saying queer-themed lyrics would not play well in the Gaza Strip. 'New rule to mark the Oct. 7 anniversary: We must launch a campaign to educate young Americans about the Middle East,' Maher said. 'Chappell, if you think it was repressive growing up queer in the Midwest, try the Mideast. You’re a female drag queen and you sing ‘I f***ed you in the bathroom when we went to dinner at your parents.’ That wouldn’t fly in Gaza, although you would, straight off a roof.' 'You’re not wrong that oppression is bad or that Palestinian and many other Muslim populations are oppressed and deserve to be freed,' Maher continued. 'You just have it completely ass-backwards as to who is doing the oppressing. Hamas is a terrorist mafia that took over Gaza… Are you sure this is who you want to throw down with?' Maher ripped Roan for ignoring the Hamas atrocities against Israelis which sparked the current conflict. 'When we get to Israel — and Chappell, this is where we must put to the test your pledge to use critical thinking and to question whether what you’re reading on social media is true because it isn’t. There’s a whole history of the Middle East that you and your fans weren’t hearing about.' 'I know you’re moved when what you see are the dead Palestinian bodies, but it’s odd that your generation didn’t seem nearly as moved by the Jewish bodies on October 7.' 'You killed at Coachella this year, but when Hamas kills at a music festival it’s a whole other thing. Doesn’t the sight of so many young women raped at a music festival make it a little personal?' 'You’re advocating for a place and a culture you would never want to live under. Gender may not be binary but right and wrong kind of is.'

New York congressional candidate, running on a plan to combat cam...	Gillen accepted a campaign contribution of $3,300—the maximum allowed—from David Rockefeller, a trustee of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and another $3,300 from his wife, Susan Rockefeller. By Meghan Blonder, The Washington Free Beacon New York Democratic congressional hopeful Laura Gillen has centered her campaign around fighting campus anti-Semitism as violent anti-Israel protests take colleges by storm. She also accepted thousands of dollars in donations from David Rockefeller, whose nonprofit has funneled millions to Hamas-friendly groups. Gillen has repeatedly denounced the campus protests and in September announced her anti-Semitism action plan. She vowed, if elected, to work to leverage federal aid to colleges to force changes in codes of conduct and increase funding to the Office of Civil Rights, the FBI, the Department of Justice, and law enforcement to better respond to threats to synagogues. She also advocated for social media platforms to strengthen content moderation. 'The situation unfolding at Columbia University should be shocking, but sadly antisemitism has been unmasked on campuses across the country,' Gillen wrote in an April 22 post. 'College presidents need to condemn this hate mongering and ensure the safety of all students.' But in June, Gillen accepted a campaign contribution of $3,300—the maximum allowed—from David Rockefeller, a trustee of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and another $3,300 from his wife, Susan Rockefeller. Since 2018, the fund has funneled more than $3.4 million to Hamas-friendly groups, the Washington Free Beacon previously reported. Defense for Children International-Palestine, which serves as a critical cog in Hamas’s propaganda machinery, has received $165,000, for example. The Israeli government designated it as a terror organization in October 2021, arguing that it effectively operates as an extension of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, another terror group. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund has also doled out $580,000 to the Education for Just Peace in the Middle East, a group that has been accused of abusing its charity status to bankroll Hamas and other Palestinian terror groups. Jewish Voice for Peace, which organized an October 2023 anti-Israel raid on a congressional office building that resulted in over 300 arrests, received funding as well. The group also helped organize and fund campus protests—efforts Gillen has specifically condemned. 'We have all seen the appalling scenes at U.S. universities: chants of 'globalize the intifada' and signs espousing support for Hamas,' she wrote in August. 'To ensure college administrators implement and enforce codes of conduct on discriminatory acts, the federal government must leverage its funding.' Gillen’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. In May, Congress launched an investigation into the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and nine other funders or supporters of the nationwide anti-Israel protest movement. The Biden-Harris administration has stonewalled the probe, refusing to provide documents in a timely fashion, the Free Beacon reported. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund did not return a request for comment. This is not the first time Gillen accepted funding from an anti-Israel billionaire. She received a $40,000 salary in 2023 as a fellow of the George Soros-funded dark money behemoth Our American Future Foundation, according to her financial disclosures. Soros funds several anti-Israel organizations, including Jewish Voice for Peace and the Tides Center. Community Justice Exchange, a Tides project, provided 'money bail, court fees and fines' and other legal services to anti-Israel protesters who blocked bridges and highways in April. Two of Soros’s sons and his daughter-in-law also contributed to Gillen. Jonathan and Jennifer Soros gave $3,300. Robert Soros donated $2,900 to her 2022 campaign to unseat Rep. Anthony D’Esposito. She lost that race by 3 percentage points, but will face the Republican again in November. Gillen argued that pointing out Soros funding for her campaign fuels 'anti-Semitic violence.'

IDF pushes forward in Gaza, Lebanon as Hezbollah fires hundreds o...	The IDF further declared a closed military zone in northern Israel in the territory stretching from the towns of Zarit and Shomera to Even Menachem in the central Upper Galilee area. By JNS Intense battles on Israel’s borders with Lebanon and the Gaza Strip continued throughout the Yom Kippur holiday, with Hezbollah firing around 320 projectiles at northern Israel. 'On the holiest holiday for the Jewish people, approx. 320 projectiles were fired by Hezbollah toward Israeli civilians. This should tell you everything you need to know about our enemies,' tweeted the IDF spokesperson on Saturday night. Two unmanned aerial vehicles invaded Israel’s airspace from Lebanon on Friday evening, one exploding in a Herzliya retirement home, the other intercepted. No injuries were reported, as the tenants, some of them Holocaust survivors, had quickly walked to the complex’s protected area after hearing warning sirens. A wide hole through the window of a tenant’s room was apparent in the wake of the strike. A large Israeli flag was hung on the windowsill in the morning after the attack.

Late on Saturday night, the Israeli military said it had intercepted a 'suspicious aerial target' on its way to Israel from the direction of the Red Sea. The threat did not enter Israel’s airspace, according to the military. In Lebanon, Israeli forces continued the 'forceful and surgical' ground operation against Hezbollah terrorists, while destroying the group’s infrastructure in southern Lebanon. 'The IDF killed 50 terrorists in face-to-face encounters and with the aid of the Israeli Air Force, while destroying from the air and artillery more than 200 terrorist targets of Hezbollah,' the Israel Defense Forces said. The troops located underground tunnel shafts, dozens of weapons storage facilities, rocket launchers, mortar bombs and anti-tank missiles, according to the statement. The IDF further declared a closed military zone in northern Israel in the territory stretching from the towns of Zarit and Shomera to Even Menachem in the central Upper Galilee area. 'Entering this area is strictly prohibited,' the IDF said. Meanwhile in the city of Jabaliya, north of Gaza City, the IDF’s 162nd Division eliminated more than 20 terrorists, according to the military. Some 200 terrorists have been killed since the operation in Jabaliya commenced on Oct. 1, the IDF said. In total, the Israeli Air Force struck around 280 terrorist targets in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, including underground infrastructure, arms depots, command centers, terrorist squads and other military infrastructure over the weekend, the IDF concluded.

IDF soldier killed battling Hamas terrorists in Gaza	His cousin, Staff Sgt. Elkana Navon, was killed fighting Hamas terrorists in Jenin, Samaria on Aug. 31. By JNS An Israel Defense Forces soldier was killed on Friday battling Hamas terrorists in the southern Gaza Strip. Staff Sgt. Ittai Fogel, 22, served as a tank commander in the 46th Armored Battalion of the IDF’s 401st 'Iron Tracks' Brigade. He was from Yakir in Samaria. Fogel’s cousin, Staff Sgt. Elkana Navon, was killed fighting Hamas terrorists in Jenin, Samaria on Aug. 31. On Thursday, three IDF reservists were killed and two others seriously wounded when their vehicle hit an explosive device in the Jabaliya area of northern Gaza. The fatalities were named as Master Sgt. (res.) Ori Moshe Borenstein, 32, from Moreshet; Master Sgt. (res.) Tzvi Matityahu Marantz, 32, from Bnei Adam; and Maj. (res.) Netanel Hershkovitz, 37, from Jerusalem. All three were part of the 5460th support unit of the IDF’s 460th Brigade. Israeli ground forces entered the Palestinian coastal enclave on Oct. 27 following a weeks-long air campaign in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks in the northwestern Negev, in which terrorists murdered 1,200 people, wounded thousands and abducted more than 250 men, women and children and brought them to Gaza—101 who are still there. The death toll among Israeli troops since the start of the Gaza ground incursion currently stands at 352, and at 735 on all fronts since the Hamas-led massacre, according to official IDF military data. Additionally, Chief Inspector Arnon Zamora, a member of the Border Police’s Yamam National Counter-Terrorism Unit, was fatally wounded during a hostage-rescue mission in Gaza in June, and civilian defense contractor Liron Yitzhak was mortally wounded in the Strip in May.

Iranian has ‘hit list’ of ex-Trump officials, planning assassinat...	Unprecedented Iranian threat to murder former Trump officials is not being taken seriously by the Secret Service, according to reports. By World Israel News Staff Iran is determined to murder ex-Trump administration officials as an act of revenge for the assassination of IRGC General Qasem Soleimani more than four years ago, but the Secret Service is failing to provide sufficient protection to those on the Islamic Republic's 'hit list,' according to a bombshell new report. 'This is extraordinarily serious,' Matt Olsen, the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for national security, told Politico. 'Iran has made it very clear that they are determined to seek retaliation against former officials in connection with the Soleimani strike.' According to the report, a significant number of people who are known to be targets of the Iranian regime are not receiving protection from the federal government. The U.S. government is struggling to contain the threat, as Iranians are engaged in extensive surveillance of American targets, including former president and current Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. An Iranian agent believed to be sent to the U.S. to scout out target was recently arrested, and the Islamic regime is attempting to hire local hitmen to murder figures associated with Trump as well. 'This is historic, and different and new,' a former senior Trump administration official told Politico. 'We’ve never had former senior national security officials, a Cabinet member, that have had this risk profile from a foreign adversary.' Robert O’Brien, Trump’s national security adviser, recently had his security detail removed without explanation, despite the fact that he is considered to be a high-value target by the Iranians. 'It is a dangerous precedent to set, to not extend a former national security adviser’s protective detail while there are active threats against his life,' Mike Turner (R-Ohio), chair of the House Intelligence Committee, wrote in a letter to national security adviser Jake Sullivan last January when O'Brien's protection ended. If Iran succeeds in its murder plot, the U.S. would be forced to retaliate forcefully, said Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) of the House Intelligence Committee. 'The U.S. would regard it as an act of war,' Himes told Politico. 'Now, how we would respond to that, I don’t know, but it would not be a pleasant day for the Iranian regime.'

Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities off the table – repo...	Israel now considering airstrikes on Iranian military positions or attacks on oil and gas production facilities US officials say. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israel is unlikely to strike Iran’s nuclear program as part of a retaliatory strike following the October 1st ballistic missile attack by Iran, U.S. officials told NBC News. While Israel has refused to pledge to the Biden administration that it will not attack Iranian nuclear facilities, U.S. officials cited by the NBC News report Saturday said they believe such a strike has been taken off the table. Thus far, Israel’s security cabinet has yet to empower Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to finalize a retaliatory plan, though the cabinet is slated to meet Sunday to discuss possible responses to Iran. U.S. officials cited by NBC News said that in addition to a strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities, it also appears unlikely Israel will carry out targeted assassinations of Iranian leaders. Instead, the sources said that Israel will most likely attack either Iranian military targets or the country’s energy infrastructure, which could include attacks on oil or gas extraction facilities, refineries, pipelines, or shipping routes. Israel has vowed a harsh response to the October 1st attack by Iran, during which close to 200 ballistic missiles were launched towards Israel, the second such attack since April. The Biden administration has urged Israel to moderate its response and to refrain from striking Iran’s nuclear facilities, in the hopes of avoiding a major escalation in the conflict between Iran and Israel which has hitherto been conducted primarily via Iranian proxy groups including Hamas, Hezbollah, and Yemenite Houthi rebels. Iranian leaders are reportedly 'extremely nervous' regarding Israel’s retaliation, and are engaging in diplomatic back channel communications to encourage Israel to soften its response. According to a report by the Saudi-based outlet Asharq Al-Awsat, Iran has sent a message to Israel via European intermediaries indicating it is prepared to ignore a limited retaliatory strike, but would respond strongly should Israel cross any 'red lines.'

Elizabeth Pipko’s position as spokeswoman for the Republican party represents a powerful alliance between the Trump family and the Jewish community. By Linda Sadacka, Exclusive to World Israel News In a defining moment resonating across generations, President Donald Trump made history as the first American president to visit the 'Ohel,' the revered resting place of the Lubavitcher Rebbe. Accompanied by his daughter-in-law Lara Trump and Elizabeth Pipko, the Republican party's first Jewish spokeswoman, the visit underscored an unbreakable commitment to Jewish Americans. 'She defends me better than anyone,' Trump remarked, highlighting Pipko’s loyalty and dedication to the cause. Donald Trump visits the gravesite of the Lubavitcher Rebbe with his daughter-in-law Lara and Elizabeth Pipko. (Courtesy) The day’s powerful symbolism didn’t end at the Ohel. Later, a gathering at the Trump’s Doral property amplified the message of unity and strength, as advocates and supporters stood firm against the forces of antisemitism. Elizabeth Pipko emphasized the urgency of the moment. 'You can completely put partisan politics aside and still admit that when you have four American hostages held by a terrorist group for a year, maybe planting a tree simply isn’t enough,' she said, delivering a clear, unfiltered critique of the lackluster responses from others in positions of power. Chosen by the family to serve as the GOP’s national spokeswoman during this pivotal time, Pipko was a natural fit for this role. As a proud Jewish woman, Pipko’s connection to her heritage has driven her to amplify Jewish voices. Reflecting on her experience at the Ohel, she shared, 'Everything that I do, I do as a Jewish woman, so of course this experience resonated with me on an extremely personal level.' Standing beside President Trump at the Rebbe’s gravesite, Pipko felt the weight of her duty and the significance of representing Jewish perspectives on such a historic day. 'I feel an immense sense of responsibility to bring Jewish perspectives into the conversation as it is important to me to make sure that every voice in this country is heard,' she added, recognizing the gravity of the moment. Lara Trump speaks at CPAC 2024 (AP/Magana) RNC Co-Chair Lara Trump underscored the Trump family’s unwavering support for the Jewish community. As the nation grapples with a surge in antisemitic violence and rhetoric, Lara’s words resonated powerfully. 'What happened in Israel last year on October 7th was an act of pure evil that never should have happened. I was truly honored to visit the Ohel and to pray for an end to this war and the release of the hostages who should not be held for one second more. Standing with the Jewish people at such a pivotal time is of the utmost importance,' she said. Pipko’s position as spokeswoman for the party is more than symbolic — it marks a milestone. Standing with the Trump family, she represents a powerful alliance dedicated to supporting the Jewish community. Donald Trump and Elizabeth Pipko (Courtesy) At a time when others often shy away from taking decisive action, the Trumps have made their stance clear. By embracing Pipko in this role, they are setting a standard of commitment that is rare in today’s political climate. For Pipko, the events of the day were more than just a duty—they were a calling. 'What’s next is always just trying to do the right thing for the people of our country,' she reflected. In this profound moment at the Ohel, and later at the gathering at the Doral, the Trumps and Pipko sent a resolute message: they stand with Jewish Americans, not just in words but in action, committed to a future defined by security, respect, and unity.

Iran ‘extremely nervous’ as Israel prepares to retaliate for ball...	Sources say Iran’s leadership is on edge over potential Israeli retaliation for October 1st ballistic missile attack, with Tehran reaching out through diplomatic back channels to soften Israeli response. By World Israel News Staff Iran’s leadership has expressed anxiety over Israel’s much-anticipated military response to the massive October 1st ballistic missile attack by the Islamic republic, according to a report by CNN. Citing multiple unnamed sources, CNN reported that Tehran is 'extremely' concerned by Israel’s possible retaliatory response and is reaching out via diplomatic back channels to encourage Israel to carry out a minor strike, rather than a major attack on either Iran’s nuclear program or its oil production facilities. According to the sources cited in the report, the senior echelon of Iranian leaders is 'extremely nervous and has been engaging in urgent diplomatic efforts with countries in the Middle East.' One source added that Iranian leaders fear that despite efforts by the Biden administration to temper Israel’s response, the White House will be unable to convince Jerusalem to carry out a smaller, symbolic retaliatory strike. At the same time, CNN reported, citing one American official, that the Biden administration is pressing Iran to limit its own response to a possible Israeli retaliatory strike. According to a report by the Saudi-based outlet Asharq Al-Awsat, Iran has sent a message to Israel via European intermediaries indicating it is prepared to ignore a limited retaliatory strike, but would respond strongly should Israel cross any 'red lines.' 'The Iranian message to Israel, sent mostly indirectly, is that it will ignore a limited Israeli attack, and will not respond to it as it is threatening to do.' 'Iran will not have any choice but to respond to the crossing of red lines, if it is subjected to an attack on its oil facilities or nuclear facilities.'

Will US soldiers operate anti-missile system on Israeli soil?	American soldiers may be deployed to Israel to supervise use of the THAAD anti-ballistic missile system, in light of threats from Iran. By World Israel News Staff The United States may soon provide Israel with an advanced air defense system, a U.S. official confirmed after numerous media outlets published reports about the potential transfer. Speaking to the , an unnamed American official said that the Biden administration is seriously considering sending Israel the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), which is specifically focused on ballistic missiles. Iran recently targeted Israel with a barrage of some 200 ballistic missiles in what is believed to be one of the largest attacks of its kind in history. But the decision to provide THAAD would be particularly significant due to the fact that U.S. soldiers would need to be deployed to Israel in order to operate the system. According to Hebrew-language media reports, Washington is still weighing up the options of such a decision. Placing American troops on Israeli soil is likely to spark controversy and make prove especially problematic to the Democratic party, in light of intense anti-Israel sentiment among the far-left wing of the Democratic party ahead of the presidential election next month. The deployment of THAAD in Israel could also provide insight into American predictions regarding an Israeli strike on Iran and Iran's retaliation. Following the missile barrage earlier in October, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had 'made a big mistake' by launching the attack. Though most of the missiles were intercepted, several struck military bases in Israel, causing damage. The IDF said that the impacts did not compromise the military's normal operations. Netanyahu added that Iran would 'pay the price' for the aerial assault, later hinting in a speech addressing the Iranian people that Israel may target the Islamic Republic's leadership. The Biden administration has repeatedly pressured Israel not to strike Iran's nuclear facilities or oil fields, but sending THAAD to Israel could mean that the Americans expect Israel will launch a powerful attack that will result in significant retaliation from Iran.

Hezbollah fired 300 rockets into Israel during Yom Kippur	During the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, over a million Israelis sought shelter in Galilee, Acre, Safed, Haifa and the surrounding bay area. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hezbollah fired 320 rockets into Israel on Yom Kippur, the IDF reports. Over a million Israelis sought shelter in Galilee, Acre, Safed, Haifa and the surrounding bay area during the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. A drone sent from Syria exploded over the Golan Heights. On Friday night, two drones were sent from Lebanon into Israel, with one exploding in a sheltered housing facility in Herzliya. Two rockets fired on Saturday from Gaza hit Ashkelon. Israeli airstrikes into Lebanon on Friday killed 22, and the IDF has been urging the evacuation of civilians from 23 people in Southern Lebanon. On Thursday, two people killed in the northern city of Kiryat Shmona in a Hezbollah missile attack were named by Hebrew-language media as Revital Yehud, 45, and Dvir Sharvit, 43. The couple were out walking their dogs when an air raid siren sounded and did not manage to reach a bomb shelter before the missile impacted. The attack by Hezbollah directly targeted a residential neighborhood in Kiryat Shmona. The city was officially evacuated in October 2023, but it’s believed that a few hundred or thousand residents – including Yehud and Sharvit – chose not to leave their homes. Last week, Israel’s military eliminated six senior Hezbollah commanders and 50 other terrorists through targeted strikes in Southern Lebanon on Monday. Israel’s Air Force (IAF) was focused on targeting Hezbollah’s southern Front, consisting of the Nasser Unit, Bader Unit, Aziz Unit, and the Radwan Forces. The Iran-backed terror group’s strategy was to establish a Southern Front that would attack Israel above and underground. During their operations in Lebanon, the IDF uncovered Hezbollah’s plans to carry out an October 7th-style invasion of the northern border of Israel. Monday’s strikes were crucial in Israel’s efforts to destroy this terrorist infrastructure and secure the border. The IAF carried out the strikes with precise guidance from the Intelligence Directorate in coordination with the Northern Command and Operations Directorate. In addition to eliminating terrorists, Israel’s military destroyed a 25-meter tunnel that extended into Israel’s territory.

CBS journalists told not to refer to Jerusalem as part of Israel	CBS memo: 'Yes, the U.S. embassy is there and the Trump administration recognized it as being Israel’s capital. But its status is disputed.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News CBS is instructing its journalist not to refer to Jerusalem as a part of Israel, the Free Press reports. In an internal memo circulated in August, Mark Memmott, CBS News's senior director of standards and practices, emailed colleagues urging them to 'be careful with some terms when we talk or write about the news' regarding Israel and Gaza. One of the many hot-button terms was 'Jerusalem.' 'Do not refer to it as being in Israel,' Memmott wrote. 'Yes, the U.S. embassy is there, and the Trump administration recognized it as being Israel's capital. But its status is disputed,' Memmott continued. 'The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel regards Jerusalem as its 'eternal and undivided' capital. At the same time, the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem—occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war—as the capital of a future state,' he added. The memo disregards the fact that US Congress recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in 1995, long before Donald Trump moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In addition, the Palestinians claim only the eastern section of Jerusalem, not the entire city. Nevertheless, Memmott insisted that journalists not only refrain from referring to Jerusalem as Israel's capital but deny that any area of the city is part of Israel. Memmott's memo was ridiculed and criticized by other journalists. Free Press contributing editor Adam Rubenstein posted, 'Standards desks are now *instructing* journalists to deny reality.' Fox News contributor Guy Benson wrote, 'Jerusalem is not only in Israel, it is the capital of Israel. What on earth is happening at CBS?' Washington Examiner senior writer David Harsanyi wrote, 'Then we can stop referring to CBS employees as journalists.' The controversy over Jerusalem at CBS comes as Jewish journalist Tony Dokoupil was scrutinized for his handling of an interview with an anti-Israel writer Ta-Nehisi Coates. Dokoupil asked Coates if his book, which contains a multitude of anti-Israel tropes, 'Would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist,' to which Coates responded by saying the plight of the Palestinians is similar to that of African Americans in the segregated south or blacks under South Africa's apartheid policy. Following the interview, CBS News made Dokoupil meet with the network's Race and Culture Unit after complaints about his tone and body language. Although several journalists at CBS defended Dokoupil, he apologized at a staff meeting. One CBS employee commented, 'There is a huge difference between how all ethnic or minority groups are treated and how Jews and Jewish issues are treated.'

Lebanese army, UNIFIL must ‘step up,’ Israeli envoy says	Speaking in Arabic to the Lebanese people, Danon said that''the land of Lebanon belongs to the Lebanese, not the Iranians.' By Mike Wagenheim, JNS The Biden administration favors a 'diplomatic solution' to the conflict on Israel’s northern border, Robert Wood, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said at an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council. Wood did not call for a ceasefire in his remarks on Thursday during the session on increased hostilities between Israel and the Hezbollah terror group, which controls Southern Lebanon. 'The solution to this crisis is not a weaker Lebanon,' Wood said. 'It’s a strong and truly sovereign Lebanon, protected by a legitimate security force, embodied in the Lebanese Armed Forces.' Lebanon’s government and its army are supposed to enforce Security Council Resolution 1701, which was designed 18 years ago to bring permanent peace to the country after the 2006 Lebanon War. The resolution calls for disarming Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy, and restoring full Lebanese sovereignty in the south. Despite the resolution being in effect for 18 years, Hezbollah has flourished. The terror group has fired some 10,000 rockets at the Jewish state since Oct. 8, the day after Hamas’s terror attack on southern Israel. Hezbollah has proclaimed solidarity with Hamas. Both are U.S.-designated terror groups. Israel has degraded Hezbollah’s capabilities severely over the past month, including sabotaging and donating pagers and other communications equipment belonging to Hezbollah terrorists en masse. 'As an act of spy craft, it is without parallel, one of the most successful and inventive penetrations of an enemy by an intelligence service in recent history,' The Washington Post reported. The Jewish state has also eliminated the terror group’s entire leadership structure. The Israel Defense Forces requested earlier this week that troops from the U.N.’s Israel-Lebanon peacekeeping mission, UNIFIL, relocate out of certain areas near the border to allow the IDF to operate during its ground incursions in Lebanon without putting UNIFIL troops in harm’s way. The U.N. force, which has regularly heeded Hezbollah’s demands to stay out of certain areas that the mission is mandated to patrol and investigate, for fear of drawing the terror group’s ire, opted not to listen to Israel’s request. Nicolas de Rivière, the French U.N. ambassador, told the Security Council on Thursday that Paris still backs a three-week ceasefire that it and Washington proposed last month. Wood told the global body that the Biden administration is working toward a diplomatic solution without mentioning a ceasefire. 'Colleagues, the United States has been clear: a diplomatic solution between Israel and Lebanon along the Blue Line is the only path to restore lasting calm and allow residents in both Lebanon and Israel to return safely to their homes,' he said. 'Even as Israel has a right to protect its citizens from Hezbollah, which has fired thousands of missiles and rockets into Israel over the past year alone, it needs to minimize harm to civilians, particularly in the densely populated areas of Beirut,' he added. Biden administration officials have suggested publicly that they support the IDF’s efforts to further degrade Hezbollah, after initial anger following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s refusal to endorse a ceasefire and instead order the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, then the terror group’s secretary-general. Danny Danon, the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, stated on Thursday that Israel is 'fulfilling our obligations to ensure' the enforcement of Security Council resolutions related to Israeli-Lebanese peace. 'The council must support us in our efforts,' he said. Speaking in Arabic to the Lebanese people, Danon said that 'the land of Lebanon belongs to the Lebanese, not the Iranians.' The Israeli envoy implored the Lebanese army and UNIFIL to 'step up' and fulfill their duties. 'The Lebanese people have been held hostage by an Iran-backed terror organization,' Danon told the council. 'Hezbollah has established a terrorist state within a failed state.'

Hamas tried to convince Iran and Hezbollah to join Oct. 7th massa...	In the period leading up to October 7th, Hamas's leaders encouraged creating the false impression to Israel that 'Gaza wants life and economic growth.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The IDF has recovered documents and minutes of meetings among Hamas officials that indicate they were trying to convince Iran and Hezbollah to participate in the October 7th massacre. According to the documents, as reported by the New York Times, Hamas's invasion of southern Israel had been planned for years and was initially scheduled for September 2022 but was delayed as Hamas was seeking the direct participation of Hezbollah and Iran. Although their allies said they agreed with the invasion and would support it in principle, they needed more time to prepare. In the period immediately leading up to the attack, Hamas refrained from escalating conflicts to give Israel a false impression that it was interested in quiet and was unwilling to engage militarily. Yahya Sinwar, his brother Mohammed Sinwar, and Mohammed Deif planned the invasion, which they termed 'The Big Project' for the fall of 2022. After the delay caused by Hezbollah and Iran's unwillingness to commit troops and participate directly, Hamas noticed the disunity within Israel caused by demonstrations over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policy of judicial reform and, as a result, felt 'compelled to move toward a strategic battle.' In July 2023, Hamas dispatched a representative to Lebanon to meet with Iranian officials and again request direct involvement, but the Iranian officials said they needed more time. After this meeting, Hamas officials realized they needed to strike on their own and hope for at least indirect assistance from their allies. The anti-government demonstrations and the proposed normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia added to the urgency to strike, and Hamas also felt the need to act before Israel implemented its new air defense system. In addition, Hamas resisted the escalation of tensions over the Aqsa mosque on the Temple Mount to 'keep the enemy convinced that Hamas in Gaza wants calm,' the document said. 'We need to control the behavior of Islamic Jihad and other factions so that we do not resort to provocations that would ruin our project,' the minutes said. In addition, Hamas would aim to convey the impression that 'Gaza wants life and economic growth.'

Iran sends unexpected message to Israel about how it will respond...	Iran will not have any choice but to respond to the crossing of red lines if it is subjected to an attack on its oil facilities or nuclear facilities. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In an unexpected turn, Iran sent a message to Israel through European channels that it was prepared to ignore a limited Israeli retaliatory attack, but would respond strongly if Israel crossed 'red lines.' The Saudi Arabian news platform Asharq Al-Awsat reported, 'The Iranian message to Israel, sent mostly indirectly, is that it will ignore a limited Israeli attack, and will not respond to it as it is threatening to do.' 'Iran will not have any choice but to respond to the crossing of red lines, if it is subjected to an attack on its oil facilities or nuclear facilities,' it added. Three US and Israeli officials told Axios that after a call between their respective leaders, US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were said to be edging closer to an agreement on the form and scale of Israel's retaliation for Iran's launch of 180 missiles earlier this month. Axios reported the US officials said Israel's planned retaliation was somewhat more aggressive than what the US prefers, but the two parties are 'moving in the right direction.' When asked by reporters if the US would approve of Israel's bombing Iran's nuclear facilities, Biden gave a flat 'no,' for which he was ridiculed by former president and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. At a campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, Trump ridiculed Biden’s earlier remarks by saying,' ‘As long as they don’t hit the nuclear stuff.’ That’s the thing you wanna hit, right? I said, ‘I think he’s got that one wrong. Isn’t that what you’re supposed to hit?'' He added that nuclear weapons are 'the biggest threat we have.' Trump said, 'His answer should have been ‘Hit the nuclear first, worry about the rest later.'' Two U.S. officials told Reuters they don’t believe that Iran is developing a nuclear weapon. A senior Biden administration official and a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) agreed with CIA Director William Burns’ remarks earlier in the week that the U.S. had no evidence that Iran was reversing its 2003 statement that it was abandoning its program to develop nuclear weapons. 'We assess that the Supreme Leader has not made a decision to resume the nuclear weapons program that Iran suspended in 2003,' said the ODNI spokesperson, referring to Iran’s leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The U.S. conviction that Iran has suspended its plans to develop a nuclear bomb may explain the Biden Administration’s opposition to a potential Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities. However, a U.N. watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), reported that at two facilities, Iran has been enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to 90% of weapons-grade. The watchdog group also reported that, in theory, it has enough material enriched to a level that can be used to make a nuclear bomb. Iran’s ongoing enrichment of uranium has reduced the 'breakout time' to make a bomb to a week or longer, down from a year in 2015.

The US conviction that Iran has suspended its plans to develop a nuclear bomb may explain the Biden Administration's opposition to a potential Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.

The U.S. conviction that Iran has suspended its plans to develop a nuclear bomb may explain the Biden Administration's opposition to a potential Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. Republican lawmakers, as well as former President and Republican candidate Donald Trump, have voiced strong criticism of the Biden Administration for discouraging Israel from making such a strike. Trump mocked Biden for opposing an attack on Iran's nuclear sites, saying: 'That's the thing you wanna hit, right?' Tehran has denied ever having a nuclear program, contrary to Israeli and U.S. officials detecting suspicious activity from Iran as recently as the past few months. Beth Sanner, a former U.S. deputy director of national intelligence, said that the risk is 'higher now than it has been' that Iran may reverse its dictum in 2003 that it wasn't developing a nuclear bomb. However, she commented that an Israeli strike on Iranian facilities may encourage rather than discourage Iran from moving forward. 'They can't get a weapon in a day. It will take months and months and months,' said Sanner, now a fellow with the German Marshall Fund. However, a U.N. watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), reported that at two facilities, Iran has been enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to 90% of weapons-grade. The watchdog also reported that, in theory, it has enough material enriched to a level that can be used to make a nuclear bomb. Iran's ongoing enrichment of uranium has reduced the 'breakout time' to make a bomb to a week or longer, down from a year in 2015. In August, three independent sources in Iran told the London-based opposition media outlet that the regime is moving forward with its nuclear weapons program 'by restructuring the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research (SPND), retaining Mohammad Eslami as the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, and resuming tests to produce nuclear bomb detonators.' The Biden administration privately warned Tehran in June about its research and development activities, Axios reported on July 17, citing three Israeli and U.S. officials. According to the report, both Israeli and American officials have detected suspicious activities by Iranian scientists in recent months. 'Officials fear they could be part of a covert Iranian effort to use the period around the U.S. presidential election to make progress toward nuclear weaponization,' the article states. American and Israeli officials met in Washington in mid-July, discussing 'mutual coordination on a series of measures to ensure that Iran can never acquire a nuclear weapon,' the White House said.

Quds chief accused of colluding with Israel, has heart attack dur...	Qaani's silence following the attack led some to believe he had been killed but caused others in Tehran to suspect he was collaborating with Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force Esmail Qaani is reported to have suffered a heart attack while being interrogated about suspected collaboration with Israel. 'He was investigated for an intelligence brief,' a source told Sky News Arabic. 'He was moved to a hospital, and his bureau chief is suspected of connections with Israel.' The New York Times reported last week that Qaani was thought to have died in the attack that killed Safieddine and many senior Hezbollah terrorists. Qaani, who was thought to have been killed and injured by an Israeli strike on October 3rd, was reported as alive, but that he and his team were being detained for questioning. Following the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, senior Hezbollah leaders held a meeting on October 3rd in Beirut, which was the target of an airstrike that killed the terror group's successor, Hashem Safieddine. Shortly after the incident, the New York Times reported that Qaani was suspected as dead or severely injured, but according to other a source quoted by Reuters, Qaani never attended the meeting. In addition, Qaani's silence following the attack led some to believe he had been killed, but caused others in Tehran to suspect he was collaborating with Israel. A source within IRGC in Beirut told the New York Times that Qaani's silence after the fatal strike had 'caused panic' among Tehran officials. In addition, his backing out of the meeting of Hezbollah officials was viewed as suspicious in Tehran. Qaani was conspicuously absent from a memorial service hosted in Tehran by Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, honoring Nasrallah. 'The Iranians have serious suspicions that the Israelis have infiltrated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, especially those working in the Lebanese arena, so everyone is currently under investigation,' a source told Middle East Eye. Esmail Qaani replaced Qasem Soleimani, the legendary commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds force killed by the U.S. in 2020.

NFL’s New York Jets falsely accused of firing Muslim head coach R...	Saleh was relieved of his position two days after the Jets lost to the Vikings 23-17 in Week 5, the team’s second straight loss. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner The New York Jets fired head coach Robert Saleh on Tuesday morning, and anti-Israel voices, a sports radio host, and Islamic groups were quick to falsely accuse the National Football League team of firing him because of his Muslim faith and Lebanese heritage. Jets owner Woody Johnson announced Saleh’s firing, and multiple sources told media outlets that Saleh was escorted out of the Jets’ facility by the team’s director of security after he was informed of the news, which a source described as protocol to ESPN. In a statement on Tuesday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) addressed what it called 'unusual hostility' that Saleh faced by having to be escorted out of the Jets’ team building, but also suggested that Saleh was fired because at the Jets vs. Vikings game in London, England, on Sunday, Saleh wore a team sweatshirt that had a patch of a Lebanese flag on his arm. CAIR took it one step further and even suggested that Johnson’s ties to the administration of former US President Donald Trump and 'racially charged' comments he made in the past, which Johnson denied, may have also contributed to Saleh’s firing. Johnson served as US ambassador to the United Kingdom during the Trump administration. 'The report that Jets security physically escorted Saleh out of the building does raise concerns about the possible motive for such unusual hostility — especially given that Saleh wore a Lebanese flag pin at a game just days ago and that owner Woody Johnson is a former Trump administration official who has been accused of making racially charged remarks,' CAIR stated. Sports radio personality Joe Beningo and anti-Israel activists on social media made similar false claims about Saleh’s firing and its ties to the patch he wore of the Lebanese flag. However, Saleh — who was born in Dearborn, Michigan, after his parents were born in Lebanon — has worn the same patch multiple times in the past. Johnson has also made it clear that Saleh was fired as head coach of the Jets due to the team’s poor performance under his leadership. Saleh was relieved of his position two days after the Jets lost to the Vikings 23-17 in Week 5, the team’s second straight loss. The Jets has lost three of their first five games of the NFL season. Defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich was named the team’s interim coach for the remainder of the season. The move marks the third time in the history of the Jets franchise that it has changed head coaches mid-season. Saleh was the first Muslim head coach in NFL history and is the fourth Arab-American head coach in history. The patch of the Lebanese flag that Saleh wore on Sunday stirred controversy because of escalating tensions between Israel and Lebanon-based terrorist group Hezbollah. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel the day after Hamas-led terrorists carried out a deadly rampage across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut last month, and Israel recently launched a ground incursion into Lebanon, which it has since expanded. The Israeli army said on Tuesday that about 180 rockets were launched from Lebanon toward northern Israel. While most were intercepted, two people were killed in the strikes in Kiryat Shmona and at least six were wounded in Haifa. Saleh had worn the Lebanese flag patch on his arm in previous NFL games and for two weeks straight now, according to the New York Post. One of his first appearances with the patch was at a game in late October 2023, which took place weeks after the start of the Israel-Hamas war but also not long after the NFL announced a heritage program in which players and coaching staff are encouraged to celebrate their 'cultural origins' by wearing international flag decals and patches on helmets for the players and jackets for the coaches. Johnson called the move to fire Saleh 'my decision and mine alone.' He said he expects the team to perform better in a statement announcing Saleh’s firing. 'This was not an easy decision, but we are not where we should be given our expectations, and I believe now is the best time to move us in a different direction,' he said. He added that he believes Ulbrich as interim coach 'along with the coaches on this staff can get the most out of our talented team and attain the goals we established this offseason.' At a Jets press conference on Tuesday, interim coach Ulbrich talked about the team 'underperforming' recently. 'We’re not playing to our potential,' he added. 'We’re too talented to be putting the product we put out there the last couple of weeks.' The Jets had a tumultuous 2023 season, finishing with only seven wins for a second consecutive season. Saleh finished 20-36 in his three-and-a-half years with the Jets and the team never reached the playoffs during his tenure. There have also been reports of tension between Saleh and the team’s star quarterback, Super Bowl champion and four-time NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Aaron Rodgers. Saleh released a statement on Wednesday, responding to his firing. He told the players: 'I truly love and appreciate every single one of you. The character of the men in the locker room made coaching you guys the ultimate privilege. Through all the ups and downs, each and every one of you showed up everyday and attacked every moment.' The Jets have not won more than seven games since 2015, and the last time they made it to the playoffs was in 2010. Their only Super Bowl appearance was in 1968 when they beat the Baltimore Colts 16-7 in Super Bowl III.

Bob Casey refuses to revoke endorsement of ‘inflammatory’ anti-Is...	Casey’s cagey answer prompted a fiery response from his Republican challenger, Dave McCormick. By Chuck Ross, The Washington Free Beacon Sen. Bob Casey refused Wednesday to revoke his endorsement of fellow Pennsylvania Democrat Summer Lee over her recent anti-Israel remarks, telling a Jewish group he has to instead 'concentrate' on his own reelection campaign. Just two days earlier, on the one-year anniversary of Oct. 7, Lee issued a statement blaming Israel for Hamas's terror attack, rhetoric that the Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh said 'inflamed our community.' Casey was asked at an event for the Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh about the status of his endorsement for Lee after she blamed Israel for provoking Hamas’s terrorist attack. 'This violence did not start on October 7th, but it can end now if we all commit to peace and diplomacy,' said Lee, who made no mention of Hamas or the 1,200 Israelis slaughtered by the Islamist terrorist group. 'Since Summer Lee has inflamed our community, or put forward inflammatory remarks, will you revoke your endorsement of congresswoman Summer Lee?' a moderator asked Casey at the event. The three-term incumbent dodged the question, though he called Lee’s remarks 'insensitive' and 'inappropriate,' especially given the timing of her statement on the anniversary of the Hamas attack. 'I think I’ve been pretty clear about condemning categorically what was said in that statement and condemning categorically hateful speech or speech that is anti-Semitic, and I stand on that record,' Casey said about his endorsement for Lee. 'I realize that some want me to get involved in other races. I’ve got a race for the United States Senate I’ve got to concentrate on,' he added. Casey’s cagey answer prompted a fiery response from his Republican challenger, Dave McCormick. 'Shameful,' said McCormick. 'Bob Casey DECLINES to revoke his endorsement of antisemitic Rep. Summer Lee.' It is unclear why Casey would publicly rebuke Lee but still maintain his endorsement for the freshman Democrat. But it could be due to the key role Casey played in helping her get elected to Congress in 2022. Lee lists Casey on her campaign website at the top of her list of endorsers, and earlier this year sent out campaign flyers that said she was 'strongly endorsed' by Casey. Casey campaigned for Lee multiple times in 2022, and hailed Lee after her victory as a 'tireless advocate' who has 'dedicated her life’s work to social justice, bringing change to her community, & improving the lives of PA’s working families.' Casey served on the host committee for Lee’s reelection campaign launch in September 2023, though the duo appear to have not campaigned together since then. Until this week, Casey had largely ignored calls to comment on Lee’s anti-Israel and anti-Semitic rhetoric. Weeks after the Hamas attack, Lee accused Israel of waging genocide in Gaza. She was one of the first House Democrats to call on Israel to enforce a unilateral ceasefire in Gaza, without conditions for the release of hostages taken by Hamas. More than 40 Jewish leaders rebuked Lee earlier this year after she planned to speak at a fundraiser for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, an anti-Israel group whose director, Nihad Awad, said he was 'happy to see' Hamas attack Israel. Lee accepted $2,000 in campaign contributions from Awad weeks after his inflammatory remarks, the Washington Free Beacon reported. The Jewish leaders, which included the rabbi of the Tree of Life synagogue, the site of the worst anti-Semitic terrorist attack on American soil, said Lee had engaged in 'openly anti-Semitic' rhetoric. While Casey has largely defended Israel in its fight with Hamas, he has courted groups with well-known links to the terrorist group. That includes CAIR, which Casey praised in 2016 for its 'fight against rising discrimination.' He said the group was a 'testament to the bravery, work ethic and ideals of everyone involved.' In 2009, federal prosecutors identified CAIR as an 'unindicted coconspirator' of an Islamic charity that raised money for Hamas. Many of CAIR’s officials have worked for decades for Hamas or Hamas front groups. Lee has not directly responded to Casey, but made reference to the 'current blowup' on her personal Facebook page. 'It's hard to articulate how shameful it is to not just condemn, but villainize earnest calls for peace and expressing equal measures of value, empathy and compassion for all the innocent folks impacted by war,' she wrote.

Blowing the Blue Wall? Democratic strategists, donors fear Harris...	Harris's dwindling support in the Blue Wall states has trickled down-ballot, with some Senate races tightening in Republicans' favor. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon With Election Day less than four weeks away, Democratic strategists and donors fear that Vice President Kamala Harris is losing ground in the crucial 'Blue Wall' states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan—which could cost her the election. The Democrats' fears come as Harris's polling leads have shrunk or even disappeared in the Blue Wall states even as the vice president has received favorable media coverage and good marks for her debate performance against former president Donald Trump, Axios reported. Harris had a more-than-2-point lead in Pennsylvania following the Sept. 10 debate, but that lead has shrunk to about half a point as of Thursday, according to an average of polls from The Hill. In Wisconsin, Harris held an almost 5-point advantage over Trump following the Democratic National Convention in August, a lead that has also fallen to about half a point. Trump holds a half-point lead over the vice president in Michigan, a state where Harris led throughout August and September. Some polls even have Trump ahead of Harris in Wisconsin and Michigan. Trump was able to sweep all three states in the 2016 election, allowing him to beat then-candidate Hillary Clinton. Democrats fear a similar sweep in light of Harris's record-low approval ratings among working-class voters and multiple unions' decisions to withhold their endorsements. The vice president is getting the 'worst' support from union households for a Democratic presidential candidate 'in a generation,' CNN's data reporter said last month. David Axelrod, a chief strategist for Barack Obama's presidential campaigns, told Axios that Harris 'made steady, incremental progress in the 10 days after the [Sept. 10] debate, but now the race has plateaued.' Harris 'had a great launch, right through the convention and the debate,' Axelrod added. 'But in these campaigns, every time you clear a bar, the bar gets raised. You have to lift your game and adjust your strategy.' Other Democrats blamed Harris's messaging during recent media appearances for why she's falling flat with voters. 'I feel better than I did last week, but it still doesn't feel great. I have a pit in my stomach,' one Democratic donor told The Hill, noting that Harris's economic messaging in recent interviews is not resonating with voters. Harris's dwindling support in the Blue Wall states has trickled down-ballot, with some Senate races tightening in Republicans' favor. Republican Mike Rogers is gaining on Democrat Elissa Slotkin for Michigan's open Senate seat. Slotkin warned donors last month that internal polling showed Harris 'underwater' in the state. In Wisconsin, meanwhile, a new rating from the Cook Political Report has shifted the Senate race from 'lean Democrat' to 'toss up,' as incumbent Democrat Tammy Baldwin loses ground to Republican challenger Eric Hovde.

‘Civilians beat us’: Israeli teen discusses Hamas captivity	When we arrived in Gaza, many people beat us. We heard gunshots and shouting in Arabic. They were waiting for us. They were civilians,' Yahalomi said, describing his entry into Gaza. By JNS In a poignant interview for the 'Children of October 7' social media project, 13-year-old Eitan Yahalomi from Kibbutz Nir Oz shared the harrowing details of his captivity at the hands of Hamas terrorists in Gaza. The French-Israeli survivor, who was released in November, then aged 12, as part of a prisoner exchange deal, recounted instances of physical abuse, persistent hunger, and being forced to watch disturbing footage. Yahalomi was kidnapped from his home during the Oct. 7 Hamas onslaught. His father, Ohad, who was shot during the abduction, remains in captivity, while his mother, Batsheva, and little sister Yael managed to escape an attempted kidnapping.

When asked if he had felt scared, he responded candidly, 'A bit, to be honest.' Throughout his captivity, Yahalomi faced constant hunger. 'My daily ration was a pita and a cucumber,' he revealed. He also spoke of being subjected to disturbing content. 'They showed me videos of them killing people. They seemed happy about it.' When asked whether he tried to avoid watching, Yahalomi explained, 'No, it wouldn’t have mattered anyway, he wouldn’t have allowed it. I saw even worse things. These images are constantly in my mind.' As for his ability to sleep at night, Yahalomi added with stark honesty, 'Not much. I’ve been through the worst, and that’s that.'

Israeli ‘illegally’ enters Lebanon, arrested in Beirut, identifie...	The case has been handed over to Lebanon's judiciary, which will decide Tartakovsky's fate. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A dual Israel-British citizen and freelance journalist with ties to the US was arrested in Lebanon. A Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper, Al Akhbar, identified him as Joshua Tartakovsky. The report says he entered Beirut a few weeks ago along with a group of other journalists covering the conflict between Israel and Lebanon. The reason for the arrest has not yet been announced, although its worth noting that he traveled to Lebanon with a British passport and also was carrying an Israeli identity card. According to Lebanese law, it is illegal for Israelis to enter the country. Tartakovsky had been in southern Lebanon reporting on airstrikes in the area. The Arab news outlet said, 'He entered Lebanon as part of a group of foreign journalists who arrived in Beirut to cover the ongoing events in Lebanon and who visit the southern suburb and certain areas on a daily basis under the pretext of inspecting the destruction.' The case has been handed over to Lebanon's judiciary, which will decide Tartakovsky's fate. One source told Arab News, 'There is a strong inclination to deport the detained journalist without awaiting any extradition request. In this case, he would be handed over to the British embassy, which would facilitate his deportation from Lebanon.' Tartakovsky describes himself as a 'freelance journalist' and studied at Brown University and the London School of Economics. He grew up in an Orthodox Jewish family, but currently, has been associated with left-wing causes. Despite having a background of IDF service with the rank of First Sergeant, more recently, Tartakovsky has been allied to anti-Israel causes. Tartakovsky has contributed to 'Zo Haderech,' a website associated with Israel's far-left and anti-Zionist movements. The detention of Tartakovsky happened after Lebanon detained German war correspondent Paul Ronzheimer after he reported on the conflict with Lebanon with Israeli TV.

3 IDF reservists killed in northern Gaza operation	Master Sgt. (res.) Ori Moshe Borenstein, 32, Maj. (res.) Netanel Hershkovitz, 37, and Master Sgt. (res.) Tzvi Matityahu Marantz, 32 fell in battle in northern Gaza. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Thursday, the IDF released the names of three reservists killed fighting in northern Gaza. They were: Master Sgt. (res.) Ori Moshe Borenstein, 32, from Moreshet, Maj. (res.) Netanel Hershkovitz, 37, from Jerusalem and Master Sgt. (res.) Tzvi Matityahu Marantz, 32, from Bnei Adam. All three reservists served in the 5460th support unit of the 460th Brigade. The deaths bring the number of soldiers killed in the ground war to 353. They fell during heavy fighting in northern Gaza’s Jabaliya region where the IDF has eliminated dozens of terrorists. In addition, troops have discovered and confiscated rifles, RPG launchers and ammunition. Ori Bornstein lived in Lod and was a machine engineering student at Ariel University. Tzvi Matityahu Marantz from the village of Bnei Adam (Seneh) is survived by his wife, Tal, and his three children: Omer (7), Ofir (4), and Naya (1). Netanel Hershkovitz was from Jerusalem and was a Deputy Company Commander in the Logistical Support Unit of the 5460th Unit, 460th Brigade. The IDF attacked a command-and-control center for Hamas and had 'eliminated at least twelve terrorists, some of whom took part in the murderous terror attack against the residents of the Gaza border communities on October 7' last year, according to Israel's security agency Shin Bet. The site, which had previously been used as a medical compound, was used to store weapons and plan attacks against Israel and the Jewish People. Last month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee (FADC) Sunday that he is seriously considering a proposal to take over all of northern Gaza to pressure Hamas to restart negotiations for a hostages-for-ceasefire deal. The Commanders and Reserve Soldiers Forum presented the 'Generals’ Plan' to the government early this month as a way to defeat Hamas. Besides turning the stretch from Gaza City north into a closed military zone after allowing all residents to leave via secured humanitarian corridors, it also envisions the IDF taking charge of all humanitarian aid deliveries.

Columbia University kicks off campus tour of Oct. 7 Hamas sexual ...	The goal is to raise awareness about the Oct. 7 attack and counteract increasing antisemitism on campuses. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner To commemorate the one-year anniversary of the Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Columbia University hosted on Sunday night a screening of 'Screams Before Silence,' a documentary hosted by former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg about sexual violence committed by Hamas terrorists during their onslaught. In the 60-minute documentary, Sandberg interviews eyewitnesses, released hostages, first responders, medical and forensic experts, and survivors of the Hamas terrorist attack about the women and girls who were raped, assaulted, and mutilated by Hamas terrorists, in some cases while being held captive in the Gaza Strip. Sandberg, who is also the founder of LeanIn.org, said in an Instagram post following the screening at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs that 'Screams Before Silence' is going on a college tour this fall and will be screened at more than 100 college and university campuses. The goal is to raise awareness about the Oct. 7 attack and counteract increasing antisemitism on campuses in the US. Sunday night’s screening at Columbia was the official kickoff of the film’s tour across campuses. 'It’s hard to believe that we are here. And it’s more important than ever that students are able to openly discuss the atrocities Hamas committed on Oct. 7 and its aftermath — without fear of intimidation or aggression because of who they are or what they believe,' said Sandberg. 'I hope these screenings continue to be a place for civil and productive discourse.' After the screening at Columbia University, which was coordinated in collaboration with Columbia/Barnard Hillel, Sandberg moderated a panel discussion with Sheila Katz, the CEO of the National Council for Jewish Women, Israeli journalist Nadav Eyal, and professor Magda Schaler-Haynes, who teaches health policy and management at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. 'We talked about the widespread refusal to condemn Hamas;s sexual violence — including a story I heard that students are walking around some campuses with 'rape is resistance' stickers on their laptops,' Sandberg said. 'We also discussed the rise of antisemitic incidents on campuses: 73 percent of Jewish college students experienced or witnessed antisemitism in the last school year. This scary reality hit close to home when I dropped my child at college a couple of months ago and saw a campus stall with a big sign that read ‘Safety and Security for Jewish Students.'' 'All of us have a role to play in making sure that sexual violence is never used as a tool of war,' she added. 'Rape is never resistance.' Watch the trailer for 'Screams Before Silence' below.

Palestinians caught looting Second Temple-era archaeological site	The site includes ancient storage chambers, cisterns, and a ritual purification bath called a mikvah, which was carved into the rock. By Pesach Benson, TPS Five Palestinians were caught red-handed looting a Second Temple-period archaeological site, the Israel Antiquities Authority announced on Thursday. The incident took place at Kherbet Umm A-Ros, an archaeological site located in the Judean Lowlands of central Israel. The site, home to remains of a Jewish community dating from the Second Temple period and the Bar-Kochba revolt. 'In these difficult times, while many of our employees serve in the reserves, the IAA remains committed to safeguarding our national heritage. These robbers sought to exploit the current instability in Israel to steal from our past. Protecting our antiquities is a national mission,' said Antiquities Authority Director Eli Escusido. The looters, described as a squad of 'antique pirates' from the Palestinian village of Zurif, were caught in the act of pillaging the underground system. The system includes ancient storage chambers, cisterns and a ritual purification bath called a mikvah, that was carved into the rock. The robbers were apprehended by police and the Antiquities Authority’s Robbery Prevention Unit. According to the Antiquities Authority, the group of Palestinians were found actively digging at the site, aiming to extract valuable artifacts such as ancient coins. The thieves brought metal detectors and digging tools to assist in their illegal excavation efforts. Four were arrested in one of the underground chambers while a fifth was stationed outside as a lookout. 'Antiquities robbers travel from miles away, entering the country illegally, and then cause irreparable damage to our heritage,' said Dr. Eitan Klein, Deputy Director of the Antiquities Authority’s Robbery Prevention Unit. 'I’m glad we were able to catch these individuals before further harm was done. We will not let anyone steal our history from beneath our feet.'

Made in Iran: Israel displays captured Hezbollah weapons	Some of the weapons seized included anti-tank mines, rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and fake rocks with explosives hidden inside. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel displayed Iranian-made weapons seized from southern Lebanon on Wednesday. 'The weapons you see here have been stored in Hezbollah bunkers on the front line for more than a year. We know about it, we saw it and now we take it and make sure Hezbollah won’t be able to use those arms,' a soldier at the Julis army base explained. Pointing to a weapons barrel, the soldier said it was found pointed at an army outpost. 'The rest of the weaponry was for breaking the fence. Really just a few hundred meters from the fence, posing a real threat, and we erased this threat.' 'Here’s an Iranian-made launcher known as Tosan,' an anti-tank missile with a range of four km. 'Here are its rockets found in a village controlled by Hezbollah. Iranian-made anti-personnel mines 'found in big quantities' inside Lebanon and ready to use. Many of the mines were found in bags with an indicator of humidity. 'Everything was ready at a very very high level.' Other weapons seized included anti-tank mines, rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and fake rocks with explosives hidden inside. Sarit Zahavi, president and founder of the Alma Research Center, told The Press Service of Israel in August that Hezbollah doctrine makes extensive use of civilian homes, where many more weapons, including ballistic missiles, are kept. 'Hezbollah stores their weapons everywhere, both between villages and within the villages themselves,' she said. 'By and large, every third house in the Shi’ite villages of south Lebanon is used in some way by Hezbollah for military purposes, be it weapons storage, the entrance of a tunnel, or a launchpad for shooting rockets at Israel,' she explained. Also on Wednesday, two Israelis were killed in Kiryat Shmona during a Hezbollah rocket barrage. The victims were identified as Dvir Sharvit, 43, and his partner, Revital Yehud, 45. The two were walking their dogs when the warning sirens went off. They and the dogs were killed by falling shrapnel. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, the Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities, killing 51 people. According to figures released by the government on Sept. 29, more than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. Israel’s war goals include securely returning northern residents to their homes. Israeli officials demand Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from southern Lebanon in compliance with UN Security Council resolution 1701 which ended the Second Lebanon War of 2006. This includes all areas south of the Litani River such as the cities of Nabatieh and Tyre, as well as the Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.

Hamas-linked agency predicted to win Nobel Peace Prize, sparking ...	Israeli groups protest nomination of UNRWA, the UN relief agency with members linked to Hamas and Islamic Jihad who took part in the October 7th invasion, for the Nobel Peace Prize. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A United Nations agency which has been linked to Hamas and other Gaza terrorist organizations is predicted to win the Nobel Peace Prize, drawing protests from Israeli non-governmental organizations. A total of 286 nominations have been submitted to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, including 197 individuals and 89 organizations. The identities of the nominees are not revealed by the committee for 50 years, though some have been publicly identified by those who sponsored their candidacy. It is widely predicted that the committee will highlight the ongoing war in Gaza against the Hamas terror organization with its selection, choosing a candidate it perceives as having benefited the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, or worked to end the war altogether. The front-runner, according to the Norwegian Peace Council, is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA for short, which was nominated early this year, despite revelations of the agency’s links to terrorist groups including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, with a number of UNRWA employees accused of taking part in the atrocities of October 7th. UNRWA’s chief, Philippe Lazzarini could also be included in the prize, which is set to be awarded on Friday. Two Israeli civil organizations, the Regavim Movement and Im Tirtzu, both condemned the committee’s consideration of UNRWA and urged committee members not to vote for the UN agency. 'The nomination of UNRWA to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize is a perversion of the mission and symbolism of the Prize and would represent an ineradicable stain upon its significance,' Im Tirtzu wrote to the committee in an open letter. 'UNRWA has been an active participant and an ally of Hamas in the massacre Hamas inflicted upon innocent Israeli civilians on October 7, 2023.' More than 12,000 Israelis signed onto a petition protesting the nomination of UNRWA, the organization added. 'We call on the prize committee not to stain the Prize with the blood found on the hands of UNRWA employees,' said Im Tirtuz CEO Shai Rosengarten. The Regavim Movement protested UNRWA’s nomination, submitting faux nominations to the Norwegian Nobel Committee for Hamas politburo chief Yahya Sinwar, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram, and internment camps in China used to house members of the Uyghur minority group. 'If UNRWA, with its documented involvement in terrorism, is eligible for a prize meant to honor peace, it's only fair to consider other organizations with similar records,' said Regavim's spokesperson. 'We urge the Norwegian Nobel Committee to reassess its candidate selection, and to issue a clear and unequivocal statement condemning the activities of Hamas and repudiating UNRWA's candidacy for any recognition or accolades - particularly not for a prize celebrating peace and human rights.' Israel’s Knesset is currently considering legislation, backed by both Opposition and Coalition lawmakers, to bar UNRWA from operating in the country. Other leading candidates include the International Court of Justice in The Hague over its rulings against Russia in the Ukraine war and against Israel regarding its operation in Rafah, as well as United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Asle Sveen, a Nobel Prize expert and historian, told Barron’s that the committee could select Guterres as a way of boosting the standing of the United Nations. 'The UN needs all the support and attention the organization can get to survive against the forces which in reality claim might is right,' Sveen said. 'A Peace Prize to Antonio Guterres will give him a unique opportunity to&#8230; warn against the dangers of making the UN and the world order irrelevant.'

Arab-Israeli ISIS terrorists plotted massive bombing of Tel Aviv ...	Israeli security forces foil major plot by domestic ISIS cell to bomb Tel Aviv's iconic Azrieli Mall. By World Israel News Staff A major terrorist plot targeting the Azrieli Mall in Tel Aviv was foiled by Israeli police and security forces recently. The planned bombing was thwarted by a joint operation involving the Israel Police and the Shin Bet internal security agency. The operation culminated in the arrest of five residents of the Arab-Israeli town of Taybeh who are suspected of establishing a terror cell affiliated with the Islamic State in Syria (ISIS) terror group. Criminal charges are slated to be filed soon in the case. The plot was uncovered by Shin Bet and police investigators during a covert month-long probe focusing on five Taybeh residents. The cell was planning a massive car bombing attack on Azrieli Mall as part of ISIS activities. The leaders of the terror cell were identified as Mahmoud Azam and Ibrahim Sheikh Yusuf, both residents of Taybeh. The pair were arrested during the early stages of the investigation. It was revealed that the two had intentions to travel abroad to join ISIS combat zones, and had maintained connections with foreign ISIS operatives. They recruited three additional Taybeh residents—Sajjad Mazarweh, Abdallah Baransi, and Abd Al-Karim Baransi—to support their terrorist activities within Israel. Following meticulous evidence gathering, the police department’s Gideon counter-terror unit, in collaboration with Taybeh station police officers, apprehended the suspects and seized various materials in their possession. During interrogations, the suspects admitted that they had studied online footage of car bomb attacks in Syria and discussed the quantity of explosive material required to carry out a major attack on Azrieli Mall. In response to the investigation's conclusions, the Shin Bet and Israel Police emphasized the severity of this organized and dangerous local threat aligned with ISIS ideology. 'Thanks to the integrated and professional investigation by the police and Shin Bet, a major disaster was averted, and lives were saved,' stated Central District Commander Yair Hatzroni. 'We view any extremist ideological intent to undermine Israeli security with utmost seriousness and will continue to act decisively within our legal authority to preempt any future threats.' Based on the comprehensive evidential basis, a pretrial detention request has been submitted to the courts, with criminal charges expected to follow against the suspects in the coming days.

Biden reassures Iran US will not aid Israeli attack on nuclear si...	The Biden administration reportedly told Iran, via Saudi Arabia, that the US won't help Israel take out Iranian nuclear facilities as retaliation for October 1st ballistic missile attacks. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration has reassured the Iranian government that the U.S. will not target Iran’s nuclear facilities nor aid Israel in striking them in reprisal for the October 1st ballistic missile attacks, France 24 has reported. Last Tuesday, Iran launched roughly 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel, the second large-scale direct attack by Iran on the Jewish state, following a combination ballistic missile and drone attack in April. Senior Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, vowed Israel would 'exact a price' from Iran in response to the attack. Israel’s leadership is reportedly considering a number of Iranian targets, including elements of Iran’s nuclear program, as well as the country’s oil and natural gas extraction and refinement facilities. According to a report this week by Sky News, the Biden administration is pressuring Israel not to attack Iran’s nuclear sites. Now, France 24 reported, the U.S. has promised Iran that it will not enable or aid any Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear program. The reassurance was reportedly conveyed via Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of the oil-rich Sunni kingdom. Bin Salman is said to have passed the Biden White House’s message on to Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s minister of foreign affairs. Earlier this week, The Wall Street Journal reported that President Joe Biden was angered by Israel’s refusal to share its plans for a retaliatory strike on Iran. For its part, Israel has reportedly refused Biden’s demand to take strikes on Iran’s nuclear program off the table. Biden and Netanyahu spoke by phone Wednesday, marking the first conversation between the two leaders in six weeks. Vice President Kamala Harris joined in on the call, which focused on Iran’s ballistic missile attack, Israel’s planned response, the ongoing wars in Lebanon and Gaza, and the administration’s fears of a wider regional conflict.

Brown University rejects pro-Palestinian protesters’ demand to di...	The Ivy League school in Providence, Rhode Island was among the first this past spring to agree to hold a vote on divestment in exchange for a peaceful end to its student encampment. By Andrew Lapin, JTA Brown University’s board of governors has rejected a closely scrutinized, student-led proposal to divest from companies with business in Israel. The rejection allays concerns expressed by some pro-Israel groups that the divestment movement was gaining momentum after the pro-Palestinian student encampments at universities across the country last spring. 'Baruch Hashem,' Rabbi Josh Bolton, executive director of Brown/RISD Hillel, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, using a Hebrew term akin to 'Thank God.' Bolton said the vote 'is a definitive and powerful rejection of divestment on every level.' Coming so soon after the first anniversary of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel was also significant, he said: 'After a year of insanity, antisemitic sloganeering, maligning of Jewish students, this is a day that we can be proud of our institutions.' The vote was in the works and debated for months before taking place on Tuesday, months before it was expected, by secret ballot. The Brown Corporation agreed with an internal committee that had voted 8-2, with one abstention, to recommend rejecting divestment. 'The Corporation reaffirmed that Brown’s mission is to discover, communicate and preserve knowledge. It is not to adjudicate or resolve global conflicts,' the board wrote in a lengthy statement Wednesday explaining its vote. The Ivy League school in Providence, Rhode Island was among the first this past spring to agree to hold a vote on divestment in exchange for a peaceful end to its student encampment. The encampments often pushed for divestment, while Jewish students reported being antagonized by the pro-Palestinian activists. Protesters at Brown were motivated by, among other factors, a Palestinian student who was shot in Vermont in November in an apparent hate crime. After dismantling their encampment, Brown student activist leaders were permitted to make their formal case for divestment to the board; similar deals were also struck at Northwestern University, the University of Minnesota and elsewhere. An internal committee then considered the case but kept its report private until Wednesday, after the formal vote was announced. Leading up to the vote, Brown would only confirm that it was scheduled for October but provided no other details on timing. Among its chief rationales for rejecting divestment, the committee determined that Brown was not heavily nor directly invested in the 10 companies included in the proposal 'and that any indirect exposure for Brown in these companies is so small that it could not be directly responsible for social harm.' Those 10 companies included Boeing, General Electric, Motorola, Volvo and Northrop Grumman, all of which the divestment proposal said 'facilitate the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory.' The school’s leadership declared it was satisfied with the process and the results of the divestment vote. 'Brown’s mission doesn’t encompass influencing or adjudicating global conflict,' Christina Paxson, the school’s Jewish president, and chancellor Brian Moynihan said in a joint statement shared with the school, alumni and press. 'Our greatest contribution to the cause of peace for which so many members of the community have advocated is to continue to educate future leaders and produce scholarship that informs and supports their work. A decision to divest would greatly jeopardize our ability to continue to make this contribution.' Paxson and Moynihan continued, 'If the Corporation were to divest, it would signal to our students and scholars that there are ‘approved’ points of view to which members of the community are expected to conform. This would be wholly inconsistent with the principles of academic freedom and free inquiry, and would undermine our mission of serving the community, the nation and the world.' Some Jews had been angry that the vote was happening at all. One Jewish member of the Brown Corporation resigned in protest over it, saying the school had capitulated to extremists. He was rebuked by Paxson, who has long argued that the vote was happening in accordance with Brown’s usual procedures for considering divestment-related proposals. At least 100 Brown faculty members publicly supported divestment, while the Anti-Defamation League and other Jewish groups have ardently argued against college Israel divestments in general. Dozens of Republican state attorneys general had warned Brown that any move toward divestment could result in pushback from their states. The Rhode Island chapter of the anti-Zionist group Jewish Voice for Peace, which had advocated for divestment alongside other pro-Palestinian groups, did not immediately return a request for comment. The Brown Divest Coalition, together with the national Students for Justice in Palestine movement, posted a profane message on Instagram directed at the Corporation and Paxson, concluding with 'Free Palestine' and, in all caps, 'All settler colonial institutions will fail.' Paxson and Moynihan concluded their communication on the vote with a plea that the university community maintain civility even in disagreement. 'Whether you support, oppose or have no opinion on the decision of the Corporation, we hope you will do so with a commitment to sustaining, nurturing and strengthening the principles that have long been at the core of our teaching and learning community,' they said.

German reporter arrested in Lebanon after appearing on Israeli ne...	Paul Ronzheimer and his team were abducted from their hotel room and released only after the German embassy intervened. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A German reporter was arrested and questioned in Lebanon just a day after he appeared on an Israeli news channel describing what he saw of the IDF assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. Neither the Bild newspaper, nor the Die Welt news channel, who both employ senior war correspondent Paul Ronzheimer, claimed that the arrest was a result of the interview. They both reported Wednesday that Ronzheimer and his team had been abducted from their hotel rooms on September 28, the day after the IDF airstrike. The journalists were handcuffed and blindfolded, then taken to an unknown location and interrogated for hours, 'probably by Lebanese military intelligence,' the Die Welt report said. After some 12 hours, they were then released, thanks to the intervention of the German Embassy in Beirut. Ronzheimer actually continued reporting from the Lebanese capital for several more days before flying home. This accounted for the delay in reporting his abduction, his media colleagues said, as they wanted to make sure he was safe before publicizing what had happened. The Bild report noted that Hezbollah had posted Ronzheimer’s picture on social media the morning of his arrest, along with an accusation that he had violated unspecified 'conditions.' The terror organization, which controls much of Lebanese life both as part of the government and behind the scenes, rarely lets reporters into the country anymore, Bild reported Ronzheimer as noting. The journalist was undeterred by his experience, saying that he would 'of course continue to report on this war,' even though 'it is currently very difficult for many reporters to report on what is happening.' In his interview on Channel 11 on September 27, Ronzheimer said he had just returned to the center of town from the area of the bombing of Nasrallah’s headquarters, which was hidden deep underground in the Dahiyeh neighborhood of Beirut. 'We felt the whole explosion, six times,' he said, 'and it was really, really heavy to feel it here.' He spoke of the then-conflicting reports of whether Nasrallah had been killed in the attack, saying that no journalists were being allowed into the area to investigate the incident or the aftermath for themselves. Ronzheimer is very well known in his home country, thanks to his news reports and his being a regular guest on all major political talk shows on TV.

Harris campaign walks back ‘Knucklehead’ Tim Walz’s call to elimi...	Walz has made a series of verbal blunders that his campaign has had to clean up, including false claims about being present at the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon The Harris campaign walked back Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s Tuesday claim that the Electoral College 'needs to go,' saying that it is not an official campaign position. 'I think all of us know the Electoral College needs to go. We need, we need national popular vote, but that’s not the world we live in,' Walz said at a campaign fundraiser in California. The campaign clarified later that the Harris-Walz ticket is not advocating for eliminating the Electoral College. 'Governor Walz believes that every vote matters in the Electoral College,' a campaign official told CNN, adding that Walz 'was commenting to a crowd of strong supporters about how the campaign is built to win 270 electoral votes.' Walz has made a series of verbal blunders that his campaign has had to clean up, including false claims about being present at the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. During the vice presidential debate on October 1, Walz admitted that he can be 'a knucklehead at times.' During her 2020 presidential campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris said she was 'open to the discussion' of abolishing the Electoral College. 'There’s no question that the popular vote has been diminished in terms of making the final decision about who’s the president of the United States and we need to deal with that, so I’m open to the discussion,' Harris said during a 2019 interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live.

Justice Department charges Afghan citizen with plotting to commit...	The Justice Department report alleges that Tawhedi obtained, viewed, and saved ISIS propaganda on his digital devices. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has issued charges against an Afghan citizen allegedly plotting to execute a terrorist attack during Election Day at the behest of Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, a 27-year old resident of Oklahoma City, schemed to help ISIS commit an act of terrorism on American soil through the acquisition of firearms and ammunition, according to the federal officials. Tawhedi allegedly sold many of his assets and moved several family members out of the United States as part of his preparations for the terrorist attack. 'As charged, the Justice Department foiled the defendant’s plot to acquire semi-automatic weapons and commit a violent attack in the name of ISIS on U.S. soil on Election Day,' said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. 'We will continue to combat the ongoing threat that ISIS and its supporters pose to America’s national security, and we will identify, investigate, and prosecute the individuals who seek to terrorize the American people.' 'This defendant, motivated by ISIS, allegedly conspired to commit a violent attack, on Election Day, here on our homeland,' said FBI Director Christopher Wray. While investigating Tawhedi, the FBI surfaced messages between Tawhedi and an ISIS-connected individual 'who facilitated recruitment, training, and indoctrination of persons who expressed interest in terrorist activity.' In addition, the Justice Department report alleges that Tawhedi obtained, viewed, and saved ISIS propaganda on his digital devices. He also sent messages in a Telegram account affiliated with ISIS and sent money to sham 'charity organizations' which fundraise for the terrorist group. While Tawhedi and an alleged partner, who is a minor, were in the process of selling his assets in advance of the planned terrorist attack, an individual connected with the FBI contacted him under the guise of purchasing a computer. During their communications, the individual informed Tawhedi that they were in the process of launching a new gun business. Tawhedi and his partner eventually met up with the FBI-connected individual in rural Oklahoma on Oct. 7 with the goal of purchasing firearms to carry out the terrorist attack. The duo successfully bought and took possession of 'two AK-47 assault rifles, ten magazines, and 500 rounds of ammunition.' The agency slapped Tawhedi charges of 'conspiring and attempting to provide material support to ISIS,' and 'receiving a firearm to be used to commit a felony or a federal crime of terrorism.' In recent months, the DOJ has been busy holding foreign extremists accountable for planning or committing acts of terrorism on American soil. In September, the agency announced charges against several top leaders of the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas for orchestrating the Oct. 7 massacre across southern Israel. That same month, the agency thwarted a planned shooting against New York Jews by a Pakistani national.

Israeli strike on Iran will be ‘lethal, precise, and surprising’	Defense Minister threatens that Iranian regime 'won't know what hit them' after Israeli retaliatory strike. By World Israel News Staff Defense Minister Yoav Gallant threatened that Israel's expected counter-strike on Iran will include a devastating blow to the Islamic regime. 'Whoever attacks us will be hurt and will pay a price. Our attack will be lethal, precise and above all surprising, they will not understand what happened and how it happened, they will see the results,' Gallant said of the retaliatory strike in a video statement on Wednesday. On October 1st, Iran launched an unprecedented barrage of some 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel. Despite the Iron Dome intercepting most of the projectiles, some of the missiles did impact military bases throughout the country, causing damage to several air force bases. In a statement, the IDF said that the impacts had not hampered the military's operational abilities. Shortly after the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had 'made a big mistake' by launching its second direct attack on Israel within six months, and that it would face serious consequences for the aerial assault. Netanyahu also appeared to hint that assassinating senior Iranian figures, such as the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameinei, was an option being considered by Israel. 'When Iran is finally free — and that moment will come a lot sooner than people think – everything will be different,' Netanyahu said in a video statement addressing Iranians citizens. Israel has yet to respond to the attacks, with U.S. President Joe Biden pressuring Jerusalem to avoid striking Iran's nuclear development sites or oil assets. Biden also urged Israel to respond 'proportionately' to what is believed to be one of the largest ballistic missile attacks in history. Much to the chagrin of the Biden administration, Israel has reportedly refused to share its plans for the attack with Washington.

WH press secretary won’t say if Biden dropped F-bomb on Netanyahu	White House Press Secretary Karein Jean-Pierre 'can't confirm' whether Biden called Israeli Prime Minister a 'f***ing liar' while expressing outrage over Rafah operation, as claimed by new book by Bob Woodward. By World Israel News Staff The White House press secretary was unable to confirm or deny whether President Joe Biden cursed at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a telephone conversation earlier this year, and repeatedly used epithets in conversations with others while describing the Israeli leader. On Tuesday, CNN revealed excerpts from Bob Woodward’s upcoming book, War, focusing on the Biden administration’s handling of the Ukraine war, the war between Israel and Hamas, and Donald Trump’s post-presidency. In the excerpts published by CNN, Biden privately trashed both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, repeatedly cursing the two leaders. 'That f***ing Putin,' Biden was quoted as telling advisers after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Regarding Netanyahu, Biden on multiple occasions cursed Netanyahu, including at least one instance in which the comments were made directly to the Israeli premier during a phone call this July, after the IDF bombed a Hezbollah base in Beirut, killing a number of senior terrorists. 'Bibi, what the f***?' Biden shouted. 'You know the perception of Israel around the world increasingly is that you’re a rogue state, a rogue actor,' Biden continued. Netanyahu defended the strike, noting Israel had killed a top Hezbollah terrorist. 'We saw an opportunity and took it,' Netanyahu said, according to Woodward. In private, Biden made excoriated Netanyahu in the spring 2024, after the Israeli military entered Rafah in southern Gaza,' referring to Netanyahu as a 'son of a bitch.' 'That son of a bitch, Bibi Netanyahu, he’s a bad guy. He’s a bad f***ing guy!' 'He’s a f***ing liar,' Biden was also quoted as saying. The president made similar comments about West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, a former Democrat who left the party to become an independent earlier this year, and former President Donald Trump. A day after the CNN report, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was questioned during a press briefing regarding Biden’s alleged statements. Jean-Pierre did not deny the comments, saying only she was unable to confirm the veracity of Woodward’s claims. 'There’s going to be many books that are written about this administration and many administrations,' Jean-Pierre said. 'Nothing atypical about that.' 'What I can say to that question that you asked me: I cannot confirm. That is not something that I can confirm from here.' The press secretary emphasized that the telephone conversation between Biden and Netanyahu earlier that day – the first between the two leaders in six weeks – was 'direct and very productive.'

Immigrant to Israel and IDF reservist killed in Lebanon	Sgt. Maj. (res.) Ronny Ganizate, who was from France, was on his third round of reserve duty when he fell in battle against Hezbollah forces. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Sgt. Maj. (res.) Ronny Ganizate, an immigrant from France who was on his third round of reserve duty, fell in battle in Lebanon, the IDF announced Wednesday. The 36-year-old father of three was a member of Battalion 5030 in the 228th (Alon) Brigade. Another soldier in the same battalion was severely wounded and flown to the hospital. Ganizate had moved to Israel with his 'out of a strong love for the Land of Israel and a desire to be part of and write the history of the Jewish people here,' wrote Ephraim, a personal friend, on Thursday. 'Ronny symbolizes all the values for which we fight,' he wrote. Another friend, David, described the religious reservist who lived in Givat Shmuel as a 'righteous man' and hoped that he would be remembered 'as a hero of Israel.' Everyone who knew him said Ganizate was always smiling and optimistic. Friends of the family said that he had also always taken his reserve duty seriously, going for his periodic training periods 'with great enthusiasm.' He had already served for nearly seven months in two separate rounds since the war broke out last year, before being called up yet again, this time to fight Hezbollah terrorist forces in southern Lebanon. When he had reached home in the summer, he wrote on Facebook about his dedication to the country’s defense and his gratitude to his wife, Shoshana, who had held down the home front when he was away. 'It's good to come home,' he wrote. 'I have to say a huge, big thank you to my wife who holds down the house, the children, and her job, all by herself. You are a superhero, you deserve a special day! Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity and strength to contribute to our country.' 'We chose to immigrate to Israel, we will not allow anyone to harm it,' he continued. 'We will continue to fight until the elimination of our enemies. And many thanks to everyone who helped at home and in the field (equipment, help, support&#8230;)! Together we will win! The nation of Israel lives!' Taking the war to Hezbollah in Lebanon has been a great success so far, according to Chief of Staff Lieut. Gen. Herzi Halevi. 'Hezbollah is making great efforts to hide the significant damage we have done to the organization in recent weeks,' he said Wednesday. 'They have undergoing command and control difficulties that lead to confusion at the decision-making level and challenges in their ability to execute. Even in Iran they still don't understand the depth of the damage to the front post they built on our northern border. We will continue to attack Hezbollah with force, without allowing it respite and recovery.' Ganizate was the tenth soldier to fall in Lebanon since the IDF began its declared mission to return some 60,000 residents to their homes by destroying Hezbollah’s ability to fire missiles at will at the northern part of Israel, as it has done over 8,000 times over the past year.

US ‘deeply concerned’ by Israel banning UNRWA: UN envoy	U.S. Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield downplays UNRWA's terror links, demands Israel solve humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff The United States Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield blasted Israel during a Security Council meeting on Wednesday, appearing to blame the Jewish State for the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip and expressing Washington's disapproval of Israeli efforts to ban UNRWA from operating on its soil. A number of UNRWA employees were found to have participated in the October 7th massacres, with the Hamas terror group deeply infiltrating the organization. Following revelations about UNRWA's ties to terror, the Israeli Knesset is now advancing legislation to ban the UN body from Israel. Speaking to the UN Security Council, Thomas-Greenfield said that the Biden administration is 'deeply concerned' by proposals to ban UNRWA from Israel. She downplayed UNRWA's links to Hamas and other terror groups, claiming that 'only a small percentage' of staffers and employees were terror-affiliated. Therefore, she argued, the body should be permitted to continue its 'vital humanitarian work' in the Gaza Strip. Thomas-Greenfield also appeared to blame Israel for requiring security inspections of humanitarian goods entering the coastal enclave. 'We are&#8230;concerned by recent actions by the Israeli government to limit the delivery of goods into Gaza,' she said. 'When combined with new bureaucratic limits placed on humanitarian goods arriving from Jordan, and the closure of most border crossings in recent weeks, these restrictions would only have the effect of intensifying suffering in Gaza. Thomas-Greenfield did not acknowledge that the Hamas terror group regularly steals humanitarian aid, stockpiling it in warehouses and selling it to Gazans at inflated prices. The U.S. envoy also failed to mention that a humanitarian worker was recently murdered by Hamas gunmen, likely in order to steal the aid she was distributing to civilians. Referencing 'squalid conditions' in displacement camps for Gazans forced out of their homes by the fighting, Thomas-Greenfield placed the onus of responsibility for their wellbeing on Israel. 'These catastrophic conditions were predicted months ago, and yet, have still not been addressed. That must change, and now. We call on Israel to take urgent steps to do so, and I reiterate the United States’ expectation that Palestinian civilians, including those evacuated from the north be permitted to return to their communities and rebuild,' she added.

Couple walking their dogs ID’d as Hezbollah missile victims	Cancer survivor and pasty chef were killed by Hezbollah missile targeting residential area, along with their three dogs. The two people killed in the northern city of Kiryat Shmona in a Hezbollah missile attack were named by Hebrew-language media on Thursday morning as Revital Yehud, 45, and Dvir Sharvit, 43. The couple were out walking their dogs when an air raid siren sounded, and did not manage to reach a bomb shelter before the missile impacted. The attack by Hezbollah directly targeted a residential neighborhood in Kiryat Shmona. The city was officially evacuated in October 2023, but it's believed that a few hundred or thousand residents - including Yehud and Sharvit - chose not to leave their homes. Yehud, originally from Eilat, had lived in Kiryat Shmona for two years. She recently recovered from cancer, according to Hebrew-language media reports. Her boyfriend, Sharvit, was a professional pasty chef working in the Galilee region. 'We lost an amazing man who was all heart. A man who loved to help others,' said Meir Ben Shitrit, a relative of Sharvit. 'We feel like we are in a bad dream, but unfortunately this is our terrible reality.' 'Our hearts are broken. We can't believe that Revital is no longer with us,' said Yehud's family in a media statement. 'She was a woman full of good intentions.' Her family referenced the upcoming Yom Kippur holiday, which begins this Friday. 'They say that when one's soul returns to the Creator of the World before Yom Kippur, that person is saintly. And Revital was saintly,' the family added. Sharvit will be buried in Kiryat Arba, while Yehud will be buried in Beer Sheva. At around 2:00 p.m. on Wednesday, sirens sounded in Kiryat Shmona. Several minutes later, the Magen David Adom ambulance service received calls from residents reporting that missiles had struck their neighborhood. Emergency paramedics scanned the scenes near the impacts, discovering the bodies of Yehud and Sharvit. The couple's three dogs were also killed in the blast.

‘I’m a Zionist’ – Biden defends Israel record in pre-Yom Kippur c...	Biden reaffirms support for Israel, saying Jews worldwide would be endangered if Israel did not exist. By World Israel News Staff President Joe Biden spoke with American rabbis Wednesday ahead of the Yom Kippur holiday, which begins Friday at sundown. Continuing the tradition of annual High Holiday conference calls with Jewish spiritual leaders, the president defended his record on Israel and reiterated his support for Zionism. 'You’ve heard me say before that I got very badly criticized as a young senator, saying, ‘I’m a Zionist.’ You don’t have to be a Jew to be a Zionist, that’s not necessary, and the idea, I firmly believe, without an Israel, every Jew in the world’s security is less stable – I mean that,' Biden said. 'It doesn’t mean that Jewish leadership doesn’t have to be more progressive than it is, but it does mean it has to exist, and that’s what worries me most about what’s going on now.' 'You’ve heard me say before that my commitment to the safety of the Jewish people and the security of Israel as the right to exist is independent — independent of that — of everything else. The Jewish state has to remain. It has to remain — the ironclad commitment to it,' Biden continued. Biden highlighted last Tuesday’s ballistic missile attack on Israel, in which some 200 missiles were launched, and the role of the American military in aiding the IDF in intercepting the projectiles. 'You know, at my direction, last week, the United States military took unprecedented action again to actively assist the successful defense of Israel.' The president called October 7th a 'second, smaller holocaust,' and recalled his visit to Israel after the Hamas invasion. 'But when I went over shortly after… I saw the remnants of what had happened 10 days earlier. I saw — and the — anyway, you all know; you understand it.' Biden said the White House 'will not rest' until all Israeli hostages taken captive on October 7th are returned. 'My administration is doubling down on our work to secure the release of the remaining hostages, just as we have freed hostages already. And we will not rest until they’re all home.' 'As you saw just last week, the United States fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Iran and all its proxies — Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis. We’re doing everything we can to ease the suffering of all the people from this war against Hamas and that Hamas started.'

Harris joins call as Netanyahu speaks with Biden for first time i...	President Biden discusses Israel’s plans for strike on Iran in retaliation for massive ballistic missile attack. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on the phone Wednesday, the first conversation the two leaders have had in six weeks. Biden and Netanyahu spoke for 50 minutes, with Vice President Kamala Harris joining in on the call. According to a statement by the White House, the call focused on Iran’s October 1st ballistic missile attack on Israel, in which some 200 missiles were launched from Iranian territory – the second such attack by Iran since April. The two leaders also discussed Israel’s plans to retaliate for the missile attack, amid reports Biden has grown increasingly frustrated over Jerusalem’s refusal to fully disclose its plans. Biden has repeatedly called on Israel to avoid striking Iran’s nuclear facilities or oil assets, with Israel’s leadership declining to commit not to hit either target. The White House said that during the telephone call, Biden 'affirmed his ironclad commitment to Israel’s security,' and 'condemned unequivocally Iran’s ballistic missile attack against Israel on October 1st.' The president and the Israeli premier also discussed the war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, with Biden emphasizing 'the need for a diplomatic arrangement to safely return both Lebanese and Israeli civilians to their homes on both sides of the Blue Line.' Biden 'affirmed Israel’s right to protect its citizens from Hezbollah, which has fired thousands of missiles and rockets into Israel over the past year alone, while emphasizing the need to minimize harm to civilians, in particular in the densely populated areas of Beirut.' Regarding the war in Gaza, Biden reiterated his call to renew diplomatic efforts to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas, and also discussed the humanitarian situation in Gaza, while pushing Israel to 'restore access to the north' of Gaza and to expand the aid corridor from Jordan across Israel.

Hamas official calls ceasefire demand to exile Sinwar to Sudan ‘s...	News that Sinwar was alive and in contact with Qatari officials put to rest rumors that he had been killed in an Israeli airstrike. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A member of Hamas's political bureau, Izzat al-Rishq, dismissed a proposal to spare Hamas leader Sinwar's life and allow him to live as an exile in Sudan in exchange for the hostages as 'an Israeli illusion' and 'stupid.' He said, 'Deporting Hamas or its leaders from Gaza is an Israeli dream and illusion that will not come true.' 'The report in one of the enemy's newspapers regarding the deportation of Hamas leaders to Sudan is a stupid statement,' al-Rishq said. 'We said in the past and we repeat and say now, that Hamas is in Palestine, fighting the enemy that is occupying Palestine,' he continued. 'Logic requires that the criminal occupier leave and the original inhabitants of the land remain.' Izzat al-Rishq was responding to a report by Kan Reshet Bet that Israel sent an updated hostage proposal to the United States. The new agreement would demand the return of all remaining hostages in a single phase in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners, the demilitarization of Gaza, and allowing safe passage for Yahya Sinwar out of Gaza to Sudan. News that Sinwar was alive and in contact with Qatari officials put to rest rumors that he had been killed in an Israeli airstrike. The IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate considered the possibility that Sinwar was in fact killed when Israeli warplanes bombed a tunnel where the terrorist leader was suspected to be hiding, Kan, Ma’ariv, Walla, and Ha’aretz all reported. However, on Wednesday, Yahya Sinwar, who was thought to be dead, reemerged and demanded the terror group resume its use of suicide bombings inside Israeli cities, leading some within Hamas to describe Sinwar as a 'megalomaniac,' The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.

Israeli UN Ambassador Danon slams Hezbollah for urging ceasefire ...	Danon said a ceasefire would be contingent on the cessation of Hezbollah's attacks against Israel and a retreat to the north of the Litani River. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon criticized the hypocrisy of Hezbollah's demand for a ceasefire while it continues to target and kill Israeli civilians. On Wednesday, before a UN Security Council meeting, Danon said, 'We have once again been reminded of the relentless terror we face.' He described the terrorist attacks that occurred in Israel on Wednesday, including a stabbing in Hadera that wounded 6 people, 2 critically. Danon added, 'In Kiryat Shmona, Hezbollah's rockets murdered a man and a woman who were simply walking their dog.' This occurred just a day after senior Hezbollah official, Naim Qassem, called for a ceasefire. Danon said, 'And yet, even as Hezbollah continues their murderous campaign, senior Hezbollah officials have the audacity that Israel ceasefire.' 'Let me be clear about that,' he said. 'No one should mistake the arrogance of these terrorists for diplomacy. Hezbollah calls for a ceasefire while simultaneously murdering Israeli civilians with their rockets.' Danon added that if Hezbollah wants a ceasefire they must first stop firing missiles into Israel and to retreat to the area north of the Litani River in accordance with UN Resolution 1701, which was adopted by the UN Security Council in 2006. Danon said, 'Until that happens, Israel will continue our operations to degrade Hezbollah's terror network.' He commented on the weapons, including a 25 meter tunnel close to the border with Israel the IDF discovered destroyed. 'We will do whatever it takes to secure our people and enable the 70,000 displaced Israelis to return home safely.' On Tuesday, Naim Qassem, the most senior Hezbollah leader after the assassination of Nasrallah and his successor Safieddine, called for an unconditional ceasefire, apparently not contingent on a cessation of fighting in Gaza. The former deputy to Hassan Nasrallah and member of Hezbollah’s Jihad Council announced on Tuesday night that the terror group was 'agreeing to a ceasefire without preconditions. First, a ceasefire achieved through diplomatic means, and then we will discuss all the details.'

As Florida braces for Hurricane Milton, this rabbi is defying an ...	The region is home to an estimated 50,000 Jews, according to the Jewish Press of Tampa, and is home to dozens of synagogues and Jewish institutions. By Jackie Hajdenberg, JTA By order of the government of Fort Myers, Florida, Rabbi Yitzchok Minkowicz should have left his home and joined the mass of cars crawling out of the state’s southwest in advance of Hurricane Milton, which is due to make landfall Wednesday afternoon. Instead, Myers is staying put and planning to host Yom Kippur services on Friday night and Saturday. He is also offering his home, which doubles as a synagogue, as a shelter from the storm — estimated to be the most powerful to strike the region in recent history. 'Chabad is in Zone A, which is actually a mandatory evacuation,' Minkowicz told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency on Tuesday. 'So if I was an individual, I probably would leave.' He went on, 'But since I’m a rabbi, and we have a synagogue, and we have people that need help, so there’s no way I can leave. So we’re going to stay here and help people, and God will help us.' By remaining in place, Minkowicz was the exception to the rule — but he was far from the only local Jewish leader trying to negotiate the demands of Judaism’s holiest day with the danger posed by the oncoming storm, which is poised to do massive damage to the Tampa Bay area, including the cities of Tampa, Fort Myers, Sarasota and St. Petersburg. Rabbi Yitzchok Minkowicz of Chabad of Southwest Florida posted a video showing storm preparations as Hurricane Milton bore down on the region, Oct. 8, 2024. (Screenshot from Youtube) Many other Jewish institutions called off ceremonies to commemorate the first anniversary of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel so residents could evacuate in time, and scrapped or rejiggered services planned for Yom Kippur. 'Due to the circumstances surrounding Hurricane Milton, we have made the difficult decision to cancel our Yom Kippur services,' read a message posted on Facebook on Tuesday by Eitz Chaim Congregation Sarasota. Below the announcement, a Yom Kippur graphic was overlaid with a red notice reading, 'Services canceled due to Hurricane Milton.' 'The safety of our community is our top priority during this time,' the synagogue said. 'We encourage everyone to take necessary precautions and stay informed about the storm’s developments. Our prayers and attention are with all those affected by this powerful hurricane.' The region is home to an estimated 50,000 Jews, according to the Jewish Press of Tampa, and is home to dozens of synagogues and Jewish institutions. Congregation Beth Am of Tampa posted late on Tuesday that it still aimed to hold Yom Kippur services but had put in place multiple contingency plans. 'Our hope is to be able to gather in person, as usual. And, if it’s at all possible, that’s what we’ll do,' Rabbi Jason Rosenberg wrote on Facebook. 'If it’s not possible to be in our building, our hope will be to conduct services fully online. While this is never ideal, our experience since the Covid pandemic began has shown us that we can create a meaningful sacred time this way.' Rosenberg added that if Beth Am cannot hold services online, its members were invited to join a congregation in Charlotte, North Carolina, for its online services. He warned that it might not be possible to send email updates in the wake of the storm. Many other rabbis and their congregants in Milton’s path did evacuate over the past days, as warnings about Milton’s potentially unprecedented danger mounted. Some plan to broadcast or join Yom Kippur services from wherever they are; others are headed to local synagogues as guests for the holiday. Countless synagogues outside of the storm’s path offered shelter — and a seat in services — to evacuees looking for a new place to pray on Yom Kippur. Congregation Shaarei Kodesh in Boca Raton, in southeast Florida, was one of several congregations to advertise free seats on Yom Kippur for Jews fleeing the hurricane. 'The High Holy Days are a time for reflection, renewal, and coming together as a people,' the synagogue posted on Facebook, above a map of the hurricane’s path. 'In this moment, we are called to build a Sukkat Shalom — a shelter of peace — for one another. Whether it’s through offering a place to pray, a seat at the table, or simply the comfort of community, we strengthen our bonds and provide safety and support in the face of the storm, we are here for you.' The Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, always overlaps with the Jewish High Holiday season, meaning that disruptions because of major storms have always been a possibility in the region. Fort Myers was battered by Hurricane Helene just two weeks ago, and the storm caused even more destruction inland in western North Carolina, where flooding has crippled the city of Asheville. A synagogue there, Congregation Beth Israel, announced on Monday that it would hold Yom Kippur services now that power had been restored to the building — but not on Kol Nidre because of a curfew that remains in place, and in an abbreviated fashion because there is still no running water in the building. Portable toilets donated by Jewish Federations of North America, the synagogue wrote, 'will enable more of you to feel comfortable coming to services on Yom Kippur and subsequent Shabbats until water is restored.' In the days following Hurricane Helene, Jewish public officials have faced harassment and been the subject of antisemitic conspiracy theories that blamed them for the hurricane or for delays in the rollout of aid. Those theories were surging again on social media in advance of Milton — along with jokes noting that the hurricane’s name is often associated with old Jewish men. There is nothing funny about the situation for those preparing for Milton’s arrival. 'It’s not unlikely that there’s going to be areas that are going to be submerged,' said Joseph Dahan, a cofounder of Hatzalah South Florida, a Jewish-led emergency services organization. ' We hope that the high-water vehicles will be able to help in that situation. And then, if necessary, there may be a need to get into boats as well, depending on where that goes.' Expecting shortages of power and fuel, the group has been mobilizing its equipment and, Dahan said, preparing for the possibility of rescuing people. It is sending crews to areas predicted to be hit by Hurricane Milton, including a team of 15 on two ambulances headed to Orlando, which is not under an evacuation order. Rabbi Mendy Dubrowski of Chabad of South Tampa posted on Facebook that he was accepting requests for post-storm wellness checks and that he was in contact with emergency service providers staging outside the city. He said in a comment that his own family had left the area but remained nearby after a commenter wrote, 'This time you should evacuate. South Tampa is not the place to be.' For Minkowicz, staying at home during a hurricane is turning into something of a High Holiday tradition. In 2022, he and other area religious Jews were not aware of an evacuation order ahead of Hurricane Ian because it was broadcast during Rosh Hashanah, when traditionally observant Jews do not use electronics or communications devices. By the time they learned about the evacuation notice, it was too late to leave the area before the hurricane hit. About half of the 149 deaths attributed to Hurricane Ian took place in Lee County. In the wake of that hurricane, Minkowicz served a barbecue dinner to people who were facing blackouts and said at the time that he hoped to deliver hundreds of Shabbat dinners to local residents. 'Now it’s a matter of helping people get back on their feet, helping them fix up the houses, getting them food, getting them what to drink, getting them supplies,' Minkowicz said in 2022. 'That’s our next big job.' Now, over the past several days, his Chabad of Southwest Florida has been collecting propane, filling sandbags and organizing donations from people in other parts of Florida and beyond. He said that while much of Fort Myers was recently devastated by Hurricane Helene just two weeks ago, the Chabad house managed to withstand the previous storm. He is expecting about 30 to 40 people to shelter there who are unable to evacuate or need to be close to home. 'If you open the shul and the synagogue, so it gives them an opportunity to feel more safe, and they have someone to ride it out with and they can be with their whole family and be with spiritual support,' Minkowicz said.

Pro-Israel congressman’s office vandalized again	Espaillat, known for his vocal support of increased security funding for Jewish institutions and his defense of Jewish students facing harassment on college campuses, believes he was specifically targeted. By Jewish Breaking News Rep. Adriano Espaillat’s pro-Israel stance has made him a marked man in New York City. Early Tuesday morning, Espaillat’s office on West 181st Street was vandalized. According to police and the congressman, as many as four suspects used a hammer to bash the office’s front glass at 3am and scrawl 'FREE GAZA' in black on the sidewalk outside. 'My staff and I walked into a mess this morning,' Espaillat told the NY Post. 'Glass everywhere, paint dripping down the walls. It’s disheartening, to say the least.' Espaillat, known for his vocal support of increased security funding for Jewish institutions and his defense of Jewish students facing harassment on college campuses, believes he was specifically targeted. 'My name was on a flier listing protest sites for yesterday,' he explained. 'But instead of peaceful demonstration, we got this nighttime violence.' Despite the unsettling nature of the attacks, Espaillat remains resolute. 'We’re cleaning up and getting back to work,' he stated. 'Our constituents need us, and we won’t be intimidated.' This marks the second time that Espaillat’s Washington Heights office has been vandalized in less than a month, with the first coming in late September when vandals spray-painted 'F— Israel,' '40k dead,' 'genocide lover' and 'terrorist' in red paint on the windows and entrance. Both incidents are under investigation by the NYPD’s Hate Crime Task Force, but no arrests have been made so far. Meanwhile, a chorus of House representatives have risen to condemn the senseless hatred. Surprisingly, even anti-Israel squad members Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman joined the call. 'Over the past month, the office of Congressman Adriano Espaillat has been attacked and vandalized several times,' they said in a joint statement signed by 12 other Democrats. 'This targeted vandalism puts constituents and congressional staffers alike in harm’s way, disrupting congressional operations and social services that constituents depend on.' New York has seen its fair share of antisemitism post Oct. 7. Just yesterday, seven anti-Israel protesters were arrested at Manhattan demonstrations, including one man accused of kicking an NYPD captain in the chest.'

Top US radio star experiences ‘dose of reality’ while broadcastin...	Sid Rosenberg experienced his first 'Red Alert,' the warning system signaling incoming rocket fire, forcing him and his team to run to a bomb shelter. By Juda Honickman, Word Israel News Sid Rosenberg, the well-known host of *Sid and Friends in the Morning* on WABC in New York City, has returned to Israel for his second-ever visit, this time to commemorate the tragic events of October 7th. As a voice of solidarity for the Jewish state, Sid is not only retracing the steps of Israeli resilience but is also broadcasting his show live from the very locations that have shaped Israel’s modern history. On the first day of the trip, Sid broadcasted live from Sderot, a city on the Gaza border that has borne the brunt of many rocket attacks. In a powerful moment, Sid experienced his first *Red Alert*, the warning system signaling incoming rocket fire, forcing him and his team to take shelter in a bomb shelter. This reality check highlighted the daily threats that residents in southern Israel face. During this broadcast, Sid welcomed a special guest: former U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump spoke with Sid for about 30 minutes, discussing his support for Israel and sharing words of encouragement for the country in these difficult times. The second day of the trip brought Sid to Jerusalem, where he broadcasted live from the JNS Studios. His guest list included influential voices such as Scott Feltman, CEO of One Israel Fund, and David Friedman, former U.S. Ambassador to Israel, along with several other prominent figures. Each shared their insights on Israel’s challenges and the country’s unyielding spirit in the face of adversity. Sid also took time to tour Israel’s historic landscapes. He visited the Jordan Valley, seeing firsthand the Jordan River that is often referenced in the infamous phrase 'from the river to the sea.' On Tuesday, Sid visited Shiloh, the first Jewish capital of Israel, a site rich with the history of the Jewish people. Sid’s broadcasts continue to provide his audience with an intimate and personal glimpse into Israel's resilience and the deep connection between Israel and its supporters abroad. Sid’s trip stands as a reminder of the importance of standing with Israel, especially in the wake of the October 7th tragedy, a date that will forever mark a turning point in the nation's history.

Holocaust survivor Lily Ebert passes at 100	Ebert’s accounts on TikTok and other online platforms promoting Holocaust education have more than two million followers. By JNS Auschwitz survivor turned social media influencer and author Lily Ebert has died in London at the age of 100, her family announced on Wednesday. Ebert 'passed away of old age early this morning, at home surrounded by family,' the family said. She is survived by a daughter and a son, 10 grandchildren, 38 great-grandchildren and one great-great-grandson. Lily Ebert — 1923-2024. A light that shone so brightly has today gone dark. pic.twitter.com/A5bymeiFTG &mdash; Dov Forman (@DovForman) October 9, 2024 In July 1944, Ebert, aged 20, and her entire family were deported from Hungary to the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. Her mother, younger sister and brother were all murdered in the gas chambers. Four months after arriving at Auschwitz, Ebert and two of her sisters were transferred and put to work in a German munitions factory near Leipzig, where they remained until liberation by the U.S. Army in 1945. After World War II, Ebert moved with her surviving two sisters to Switzerland to rebuild her life. In 1953, she was reunited with her older brother, who also survived the Nazi persecution, and the family moved to Israel. In 1967, Lily and her husband immigrated to the United Kingdom. 'Lily’s story has touched hundreds of millions worldwide,' the family said on Wednesday. 'Her life-affirming intergenerational memoir, Lily’s Promise, co-authored with her great-grandson Dov Forman, is a reminder of the resilience of the human spirit and the dangers of unchecked hatred. Lily taught the power of tolerance and faith, the importance of speaking out, and the need to stand against prejudice.' In recent years, Ebert’s accounts on TikTok and other online platforms gained more than two million followers, which she used to educate about the horrors of the Holocaust and speak about her experiences. Scott Saunders, the chairman of March of the Living U.K., who also serves as its global CEO, stated: 'Her remarkable partnership with her great-grandson Dov Forman on social media, especially through their TikTok videos, reached younger generations and educated them about the horrors of Auschwitz and the strength of the human spirit. 'Ebert’s work has left an indelible mark on Holocaust education, and March of the Living will continue to carry her message of resilience and hope, passing the torch of memory and responsibility forward,' he said. In February, Ebert met with Kindertransport survivor Walter Bingham, who was born in Germany and lives in Jerusalem, at her London home on the heels of International Holocaust Remembrance Day. 'We have to live, every day, with the pain of what we went through,' Ebert explained at the time. 'We share that understanding, and it is for that reason that meeting the inspirational Walter was so special.'

The Mideast war ‘has got to end,’ declares Kamala Harris	Speaking with comedian Stephen Colbert, Vice President Kamala Harris calls for ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas 'as immediate as possible,' says expanding Middle East conflict must end. By World Israel News Staff Vice President Kamala Harris called for an immediate halt to fighting in the Middle East, even as the war between Israel and Iran’s proxies continues to escalate with an expanding conflict in Lebanon and an anticipated Israeli reprisal against Iran following a recent ballistic missile attack. Speaking with comedian Stephen Colbert Tuesday night, Harris responded to a question regarding the Gaza war and repeated claims since December that a second ceasefire deal and hostage release were in the offing. Harris called for an end to the fighting 'as immediately as possible,' saying that the war between Israel, Hezbollah, Hamas, Iran, and Yemenite Houthis 'has got to end. It’s got to end.' 'We cannot lose some belief in its possibility. Because, to your point, we throw up our hands instead of rolling up our sleeves. But it is complex. It is a conversation that requires probably more time than you and I have right now.' The vice president noted that many of the issues essential to a truce and hostage deal have been worked out in negotiations, while admitting that without a deal such progress 'is meaningless.' 'Close means that a lot of the details have been worked out, but details remained,' Harris said. 'And so there has been some progress. But it is meaningless unless a deal is actually reached. So, I don't want to suggest to you that we should be applauded for getting close at times to a deal. The reality of it is that 1,200 people were massacred. There are still hostages being held in Gaza.' Harris mentioned her meetings with the families of Israeli hostages held captive in the Gaza Strip, and with relatives of Gazans killed in the ongoing war, saying that the U.S. must continue to pursue a permanent ceasefire in the coastal enclave. 'There is pain, pain and suffering that is happening in that region of the world, and we must work, and the United States must work and not lose hope and not throw up our hands around the role we must play in urging and seeking and building toward a resolution.' 'And the first thing that's going to unlock that is that we've got to get a deal done. We're not going to give up.'

6 wounded in Arab-Israeli terrorist rampage in coastal city	Armed civilians help stop terrorist stabbing attack and capture terrorist in Hadera. By World Israel News Staff At least six people were wounded, including two in critical condition, Wednesday morning, when an Israeli Arab terrorist brandishing an axe and a knife stabbed passersby at four different locations in the coastal city of Hadera. The attack took place just after 11:00 a.m. Wednesday when the terrorist wounded three people on Hagitit Street in Hadera, before attacking other passersby at several other locations on Yitzhak Ben Tzvi Street. Three armed civilians and a police officer confronted the terrorist, who attempted to flee the scene on a scooter. After shots were fired at the terrorist wounding him, the police officer, with the help of the armed civilians, managed to tackle and subdue the terrorist. Security personnel were deployed to the area and are conducting searches for any possible accomplices. Emergency first responders from Magen David Adom (MDA) and United Hatzalah were dispatched to the scene to treat the wounded and evacuate them to Hillel Yaffe Medical Center in Hadera. According to MDA, two of the victims, men in their 30s and 50s, are in critical condition, while three others, roughly 55, 60, and 70 respectively, were seriously wounded. The sixth victim is listed in moderate condition. 'We arrived at the scene where there was a seriously injured person with stab wounds in multiple areas of his body and suffered from multisystem trauma,' said MDA first responder Shaked Hajaj. 'He was semi-conscious; we provided lifesaving medical treatment and evacuated him to the hospital. After that, we returned to the scene to continue treating other injured individuals.' The wounded terrorist has been taken into custody and identified as Ahmad Jabareen, 36, an Israeli citizen and resident of the Arab city of Umm al-Fahm. Hadera Mayor Nir Ben Haim said Wednesday afternoon that Jabareen had used his scooter to move from one area to the next during his rampage.

Oct. 7 war ‘most covered event’ in Israeli history	The GPO has also organized almost 100 tours and events since the start of the war, as well as screenings of the film documenting the atrocities committed by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023. By JNS The ongoing Israel Defense Forces campaign against Iranian-backed terrorist organizations on the Jewish state’s southern and northern borders is the country’s most highly-covered war since 1948, the Government Press Office said on Tuesday. Since the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 cross-border massacre, Jerusalem has issued 5,530 press passes to reporters, photographers and other media personnel, the government agency declared in a statement. The GPO pass, much like those in other countries, facilitates journalists’ entry to closed press conferences, courts and other official institutions. 'The leading countries in sending journalists to cover the war are the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany, which together constitute almost 60% of the journalists,' said GPO Director Nitzan Chen. 'There were also countries that cover Israel less frequently, such as Romania, Ukraine, Argentina, Nepal and Singapore, that have sent journalists to Israel,' he added. 'The GPO will continue to be here for every challenge and every mission. We are committed to protecting the truth and telling Israel’s story, in every language, in every place and at any time,' said Chen. Almost a quarter of all reporters who arrived following the outbreak of the war came from the United States, with 1,221 new GPO cards issued, followed by the United Kingdom (985), France (647), Germany (314), Turkey (278), Japan (255), Italy (253), Spain (191), Canada (122) and Switzerland (101). The outlets that sent the most journalists were the British Broadcasting Corporation (425 GPO cards), NBC News (207), CNN (196), CBS (183), Italian broadcaster RAI (162 cards), Sky News (149) and Reuters (130). The GPO has also organized almost 100 tours and events since the start of the war, as well as screenings of the film documenting the atrocities committed by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023. Thousands of foreign journalists participated in the tours, the GPO stated, which mainly encompassed places like Sderot, the kibbutzim of Kfar Aza, Be’eri and Nir Oz, Netiv HaAsara and the site of the Nova festival. The GPO is situated in the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office alongside the country’s National Public Diplomacy Directorate.

Turkey’s president denounces Israel as a ‘Zionist terrorist organ...	Recep Tayyip Erdogan calls the state of Israel a 'terrorist organization,' hints that Turkey could confront the Jewish state, while castigating American lawmakers who applauded Netanyahu during his address to Congress. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Staff Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the State of Israel a terrorist organization Wednesday, and hinting at a possible future confrontation between Turkey and the Jewish state. Addressing a gathering of members of his Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in the Turkish parliament, Erdogan castigated Israel over its attacks on Iranian proxy groups, including the Hezbollah and Hamas terrorist groups. Erdogan warned that Israel's attacks on the two organizations, which began attacking Israel on October 8th and 7th, 2023 respectively, could lead to a wide-spread regional war. Denouncing Israel as a 'Zionist terrorist organization,' Erdogan reiterated his accusations that Jerusalem is plotting territorial encroachments against Turkey, a claim he made to the Turkish parliament Tuesday. 'After Lebanon, the next place on which Israel will set its eyes will be our homeland,' Erdogan told Turkish lawmakers Tuesday. Erdogan doubled down on the claim Wednesday, adding that Turkey was prepared to defend its territory and confront Israel. 'Turkey has the strength to burst their bubble. Israel's promised land delusion' will ultimately lead to great disappointment and defeat.' The Turkish president also condemned Western powers, accusing them of 'hypocrisy' vis-a-vis Israel and the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. Erdogan's government is working on 'exposing the hypocrisy in the West at every turn,' he said, taking aim in particular at American lawmakers who welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to a joint session of Congress in July. History 'never forgive those who applauded Netanyahu who has the blood of tens of thousands on his hands,' Erdogan said. Erdogan defended Palestinian terrorist groups including Hamas, calling its members 'freedom fighters' who are 'fighting for the honor of the Muslim world.'

Yazidi woman held in Gaza escapes – with Israel’s help	Fawzia Amin Sido had been sold by ISIS to a Hamas member who fought alongside them in Iraq and Syria. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News An Iraqi Yazidi woman held against her will in Gaza for four years escaped last week and is now home thanks to the efforts of a Canadian Jew who is known for rescuing Yazidis and the fact that IDF forces killed one of her captors. At age 11, Sido had been kidnapped and enslaved among thousands of other women and girls of her religio-ethnic minority by the Muslim extremist group ISIS when it took over the Sinjar region of Iraq in 2014. She spent several years of her captivity in Syria, she told CNN in an interview last week. That was where she was bought by a Hamas member who had fought alongside his fellow terrorists in their drive to establish a brutal caliphate throughout the Middle East. In 2020 he brought her to Gaza through Egypt using a fake Arab ID for his victim, who had been forced to have his children. Her family became aware that she was still alive in November when they saw a clip of her on TikTok that Kurdish news network Rudaw publicized. They contacted Steve Maman, who has become known in their persecuted community as the 'Jewish Schindler' for having managed to free some 140 Yazidis from captivity due to his contacts around the world. In an interview with i24News, Maman said that Sido had 'gathered her courage' to make and upload the video appealing for help after the brother of her 'owner' was killed in a battle with the IDF, and she wasn’t being watched so carefully. 'She was brutally beaten' after her captors’ family saw the news show, he said. In a separate interview, Maman told Ynet that it took months of work on two separate levels for the operation to succeed. First, there were months of behind-the-scenes political and diplomatic maneuvering with Iraqi, Israeli and American officials, although Iraq refused to work with Israel directly. For one, Maman said it took some hard work by both American and Israeli officials to obtain a temporary travel document for the Iraqi woman in lieu of a passport so that she could at the end enter Jordan through the Allenby crossing. They also worked with Sido herself. Maman said that for months his group 'trained her to make contact with the IDF, identify fences, and spot potential crossings.' At one point, he noted, his team made a direct attempt to extract her through a tunnel from Rafah into Egypt. Intermediaries offered to pay Hamas the $5,000 smuggling fee, he said, but 'just as we were close to executing the plan, Egypt tightened its border control with Gaza, making it very difficult to cross. The fighting intensified, and Israel moved into the area.' In commenting on the incident Thursday, the IDF stated, 'In a complex operation coordinated between Israel, the United States, and other international actors, [Sido] was recently rescued in a secret mission from the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom Crossing.' The Iraqis acknowledged the release without mentioning either Maman, Israel or even where Sido had been held, saying it had been accomplished 'via a joint effort with the international intelligence service.' 'It was the hardest rescue operation I’ve ever done,' Maman said, due to all the actors that needed to be involved. The businessman-cum-philanthropist also noted to i24 News that according to his sources, there are at least a few other Yazidi women in Gaza whom Hamas fighters and their families are holding against their will.

Israel’s soccer association responds to FIFA’s decision not to su...	The PFA submitted a proposal in May to sanction Israel and ban Israeli teams from all international soccer competitions due to the war in Gaza. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner The Israel Football Association (IFA) has reacted to FIFA’s recent decision not to suspend the Israeli club and instead investigate the IFA over allegations of discrimination by the Palestinian Football Association (PFA), which is also calling for Israel’s suspension from international soccer matches. 'Whoever fantasized about the suspension of Israeli football from the international arena or sanctions through lies and false accusations, has suffered a defeat,' read a statement given to Fox News Digital by IFA head of communications Shlomi Barzell over the weekend. 'Again, we have acted over time in different channels, in a calculated and proactive manner in the face of the challenge of the Palestinian Association and its leader to distort reality, and the result today leaves no room for doubt.' 'We respect the authors of the report submitted to the council members and the decision of the council members to consider transferring two issues to a legal examination, as long as there is any factual justification for it,' the statement further noted. 'Thanks to values that represent a glorious democracy and an independent and determined legal system of the Football Association, we have never violated and will not violate any of the FIFA/UEFA rules.' FIFA, the world’s governing body for soccer, announced on Oct. 3 that its disciplinary committee will launch an investigation into claims by the PFA that the IFA is complicit in the Israeli government’s alleged violation of international law during the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The PFA also accused the IFA of discriminating against Arab players and including teams located in Palestinian territory in its leagues. 'The FIFA Disciplinary Committee will be mandated to initiate an investigation into the alleged offense of discrimination raised by the Palestine Football Association,' FIFA said in a statement. *'FIFA’s Governance, Audit, and Compliance Committee will be entrusted with the mission to investigate — and subsequently advise the FIFA Council on — the participation in Israeli competitions of Israeli football teams allegedly based in the territory of Palestine.' FIFA gave no timetable for when results of the investigation will be announced. 'The FIFA Council has implemented due diligence on this very sensitive matter and, based on a thorough assessment, we have followed the advice of the independent experts,' added FIFA President Gianni Infantino. 'The ongoing violence in the region confirms that, above all considerations, and as stated at the 74th FIFA Congress, we need peace. As we remain extremely shocked by what is happening, and our thoughts are with those who are suffering, we urge all parties to restore peace to the region with immediate effect.' The PFA submitted a proposal in May to sanction Israel and ban Israeli teams from all international soccer competitions due to the war in Gaza. The proposal cited 'international law violations committed by the Israeli occupation in Palestine, particularly in Gaza' and referenced FIFA statutory commitments on human rights and against discrimination. The proposal also accused the Israel Football Association (IFA) of 'providing moral, economic, and practical support to the occupation' of Palestinian territories. FIFA has repeatedly delayed making its final decision about the PFA proposal.

‘Not a thing that comes to mind’: Vowing new way forward, Harris ...	The co-hosts requested and received an extended explanation of what Harris was doing when Biden called her to tell her he was dropping out of the race. By Andrew Stiles and Thaleigha Rampersad, The Washington Free Beacon Vice President Kamala Harris continued her October media blitz on Tuesday, sitting down for a friendly chat with the ladies of The View. CNN media expert Brian Stelter predicted the female co-hosts would ask 'sharp questions.' They did not, obviously, but the softball nature of the interview did not stop Harris from providing a flawless soundbite for a future Donald Trump campaign ad. Having spent the last several months promising 'a new way forward' while pretending the Biden-Harris administration was not currently in power, Harris failed to identify a single thing she would have done differently compared to President Joe Biden. 'There is not a thing that comes to mind,' she said. 'And I've been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact.' That was Harris's second attempt at a response to co-host Sunny Hostin, who asked what the 'biggest specific difference' would be between a Biden presidency and a Harris presidency. Her initial answer was an inscrutable word salad about small businesses. 'Well, [Biden and I are] obviously two different people, and we have a lot of shared life experiences. For example, the way we feel about family and our parents and so on, but we're also different people, and I will bring those sensibilities to how I lead,' Harris said. 'I love our small businesses. My mother raised my sister and me predominantly, but we had what we called a second mother who lived two houses down who helped my mother raise us. She was a small business owner. I love our small businesses. And, um, and so the influence of a personal experience will have its impact on a presidency.' Later on in the interview, Harris offered a third response. 'You ask me what's the biggest difference between Biden and me? I'm going to have a Republican in my cabinet,' she said. Given the vice president's limited ability to speak without a script, perhaps the 'biggest difference' question could be considered a 'sharp' one. The other questions? Not so much. 'I personally cannot understand why anyone would vote for [Trump],' said Joy Behar, 82. 'A lot of it is, I think, is getting bad information—people are getting bad information from other channels. But do you have an explanation for this at all?' Harris proceeded to explain why Trump is bad. This elicited a series of cackles, affirmative grunts, and cheers from the audience, which pretty much sums up how the interview went. 'If, no, when you become president will you come back on The View?' Ana Navarro asked. (Of course she would.) The co-hosts requested and received an extended explanation of what Harris was doing when Biden called her to tell her he was dropping out of the race. 'I needed to talk to God,' she said. Harris was referring to her chat with longtime pastor Amos Brown, who in 2001 implied the United States brought the 9/11 terrorist attacks on itself by, among other things, declining to participate in a United Nations conference on racism. Politico previewed Harris's appearance on The View by noting it would be aimed at the 'sandwich generation' of middle-aged Americans struggling to support young children as well as aging parents. Hostin used this exact phrasing while prompting Harris to discuss her new policy proposal for a new taxpayer-funded health care benefit. It was almost as if the Harris campaign had scripted the entire exchange. Whoopi Goldberg signed on behalf of her fellow co-hosts and Harris supporters, telling the vice president: 'We're honored and proud to have you at this table.'

Eden Golan performs ‘October Rain’ in front of thousands at Oct. ...	After her two performances on Monday, Golan wrote about commemorating the Hamas terrorist attack in an Instagram post, saying, '10.7 will be a day we will never forget.' By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Eden Golan, Israel’s representative to the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest, performed her original song 'October Rain' at the United Nations headquarters and in New York City’s Central Park on Monday in two separate events commemorating the one-year anniversary of the deadly Hamas terrorist attacks in southern Israel that took place on Oct. 7, 2023. The song Golan performed at the UN memorial event and later at Central Park’s Summer Stage was initially written for this year’s Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo, Sweden. However, it was rejected by the European Broadcasting Union, which organizes the contest, for being too political since it references the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre. Golan instead competed in the Eurovision with a reworded version of the song, titled 'Hurricane,' and finished in fifth place in the international competition. Golan also performed Israel’s national anthem 'Hatikvah' at the UN memorial event, which was attended by hundreds of ambassadors, diplomats, pro-Israel activists, and family members of Hamas hostages as well as those murdered in the Hamas massacre on Oct. 7. The event was organized by the Israeli Mission to the UN in collaboration with Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which live streamed the event on social media. The ceremony’s speakers included US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Rabbi Doron Perez, whose son Daniel was murdered in the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas terrorists who still hold his body captive in the Gaza Strip, and Sigal Mansouri, whose daughters, Roya and Norel, were murdered at the Nova music festival. 'Our heart breaks for the victims, for the brave soldiers who gave their lives to defend us, for the families who have been torn apart and for the 101 innocent souls still held in the terror tunnels of Gaza,' said Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon. 'To the hostages and their families we say this: you are not forgotten. Every day, every moment, we carry you with us. We will never stop fighting for you until every last one of you is back home. Your names, your faces, your stories are forever etched into our hearts and we will make sure the world cannot look away.' The UJA-Federation of New York, Jewish Community Relations Council, and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum organized the community-wide gathering in Central Park on Monday night. The memorial ceremony was attended by hundreds of pro-Israel supporters and also elected officials from New York, including Gov. Kathy Hochul, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, US House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, US Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, state Attorney General Letitia James, and state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli. The event additionally featured a musical performance by Israeli singer-songwriter David Broza and student choirs, speeches by survivors of the Oct. 7 attacks, and a candle-lighting ceremony. After her two performances on Monday, Golan wrote about commemorating the Hamas terrorist attack in an Instagram post, saying, '10.7 will be a day we will never forget.' 'Yesterday, I [sic] had the honor to perform at the UN and later on at central park to share the pain we’ve experienced and continue to feel,' she wrote. 'Being a free nation has a stronger meaning today than ever, and I’m proud to stand in this room and in front of this crowd to sing my country’s national anthem.' She concluded by saying, 'We can’t stop speaking about the hostages — they all must come home.'

Syria: Seven killed in Israeli strike in Damascus	The upscale neighborhood where the attack occurred is home to the Iranian embassy, which tweeted that no Iranian citizens were killed in the strike. By JNS Syrian state media reported on Tuesday that an Israeli airstrike targeted a residential building in Damascus, killing seven people and wounding 11 others. The strike, in the Mazzeh district of the Syrian capital, also caused significant material damage, according to the Syrian Arab News Agency. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an organization associated with the Syrian opposition, reported that nine people were killed, including two non-Syrians. According to Ynet, the target of the strike was Haj Samer, a senior official in Hezbollah’s Unit 4400, responsible for transferring weapons to the terrorist group from Iran and its proxies. According to the Saudi state-owned Al Arabiya TV channel, the building that was struck was frequented by Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah officials. The upscale neighborhood where the attack occurred is home to the Iranian embassy, which tweeted that no Iranian citizens were killed in the strike. On April 1, Brig. Gen. Mohammad Zahedi, a top commander in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps’ Quds Force responsible for Syria and Lebanon, was killed in an alleged Israeli strike on a building adjacent to the Iranian embassy in Damascus. That attack prompted Iran’s first-ever direct strike on Israel a couple of weeks later. On Sept. 30, Syrian media reported that three people had been killed and nine wounded in Israeli airstrikes in Damascus. One of those killed was well-known Syrian TV journalist Safaa Ahmed, according to Syrian state television. Israel rarely admits to attacks on Syrian territory, although in February Jerusalem revealed that it had attacked more than 50 targets belonging to Hezbollah and other Iran-backed terror groups in Syria since Oct. 7.

‘Megalomaniac’ Sinwar demanding renewed suicide bombings of Israe...	After replacing Ismail Haniyeh as head of Hamas' politburo, Yahya Sinwar has reportedly demanded the terror group resume suicide bombings in Israeli cities, leading some in Hamas to denounce Sinwar as a 'megalomaniac.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Staff Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar has demanded the terror group resume its use of suicide bombings inside Israeli cities, leading some within Hamas to describe Sinwar as a 'megalomaniac,' The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. Sinwar, who has commanded Hamas forces in the Gaza Strip since 2017, also took control over the terrorist organization's politburo in August, following the assassination of his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, in a bombing in Tehran. According to Wednesday's report, immediately upon taking control of the politburo, Sinwar pushed for the resumption of large-scale suicide bombing attacks against Israeli cities, a tactic which fell into decline at the end of the Second Intifada in the mid 2000s. Days later, a Hamas terrorist died when a bomb he was carrying detonated prematurely in Tel Aviv. Citing a handwritten letter from last month attributed to Sinwar, the Journal wrote that the de facto Gaza ruler has prepared for a lengthy terror campaign to 'break Israel's will,' and ultimately destroy the Jewish state. Sinwar's behavior has led to concerns among other senior Hamas leaders, who reportedly have described him as a 'megalomaniac' who is too radical even for some in the fanatical Islamist Hamas. Arab intelligence officials who claim to be communicate 'regularly' with Sinwar told The Wall Street Journal that while prominent figures within Hamas fear Sinwar's plan may be too 'grandiose,' thus far none have openly defied his call for a new campaign of suicide bombings. According to Washington Institute senior fellow Matthew Levitt, who spoke with the Journal, Sinwar's ascension will likely mark a further radicalization of Hamas. 'Under Sinwar, Hamas can be expected to be a much clearer-cut, hard-line fundamentalist organization.'

Archeological find in Jerusalem sheds light on ancient Kingdom of...	2,700-year-old administrative center used by the Kingdom of Judah unearthed in Jerusalem, highlighting impact the Assyrian invasion had on the southern Jewish kingdom. By World Israel News Staff For the first time in Jerusalem, archeological excavation have found evidence showing the impact of the Biblical-era Assyrian king Sennacherib's military campaign on the economy of the Kingdom of Judah. During Israel Antiquities Authority excavations funded by the Israel Land Authority prior to the construction of the new Mordot Arnona neighborhood in the capital, revealed changes in the Judahite administration from the days of King Hezekiah in wake of the Assyrian military campaign and aftermath. Until now, evidence of the campaign which followed Judah's rebellion was known from the Judean Lowlands (Judean Shephelah). From the recent excavations, a picture emerges indicating that the original Judahite administrative structure that existed on this site was completely destroyed. 'We discovered remains of a significant royal administrative center from the days of King Hezekiah, and perhaps even from the reign of his father, King Ahaz,' say Neria Sapir, Natan Ben-Ari and Benyamin Storchan, excavation directors on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority. 'The center functioned in the last third of the 8th century BCE but was destroyed down to its foundations and buried under a massive heap of stones.' 'The stone pile formed a platform upon which subsequent structure was erected, holding a commanding view of all the agricultural areas to the east of the Armon Ha-Natziv – Ramat Raḥel ridge, and could be seen from afar. Large building stones originating from the early structure were deliberately incorporated into the heap.' 'We interpret these dramatic changes as a statement by the Assyrian imperial government, intended to convey a political-diplomatic message to the surrounding region and make it clear ‘who is really in charge’ by overhauling the administrative structure and its function.' 'As the Assyrians were still interested in the agricultural produce and taxes Judah could provide, they did allow for the existence of an independent Judahite administration, buy rather intensified its heavy economic demands.' The administrative activity of Judah included the concentration and management of the agricultural produce farmers used to pay taxes to the kingdom. The produce was transported and delivered in large ceramic storage jars – perhaps also stored here as a reserve for times of scarcity. In addition, wine, and possibly olive oil, were produced here in the Morodot Arnona neighborhood. Evidence of the changes in the Judahite administration after Sennacherib's military campaign found in Morodot Arnona include the discovery of an array of stamp impression jar handles. The long chronology of the seal assemblage portray Mordot Arnona's significance and continuity across changing administrative stages. Dating from the 8th century BCE onwards, dozens of 'lmlk' – '(belonging) to the king' stamp impressions were discovered here, as well as 17 handles with 'private' names written in Hebrew script. Among the names on the ‘private’ jar-handle stamps are Menachem Yubna (lmnḥm/ywbnh), Peqach Tavra (lṗqḥ/tbr’), Tzophen Azaryahu (ṣpn.ʿ/zryhw), and others. Who were these people? Were they the elite estate land owners who were the drivers of the kingdom's economy; or, were perhaps senior Judahite officials? The findings from Arnona, which will be published together with a team of researchers from Tel Aviv University led by Prof. Oded Lipschits, strengthen the hypothesis that the ‘private’ stamp impressions are part of a short-lived administrative system, operating prior to Sennacherib's military campaign – as part of the Kingdom of Judah’s preparations, led by King Hezekiah, to rebel against Assyria, at which time taxation to the Assyrian Empire ceased. From the beginning of the 7th century BCE onward, the lmlk stamp impressions differ from the earlier types and mark the return of Assyrian taxation in the aftermath of Sennaherib's campaign. According to the Minister of Heritage, Rabbi Amichai Eliyahu, 'It is very moving to encounter messages from high-ranking officials in the Judahite administration from some 2,700 years ago. The fascinating discovery by the Israel Antiquities Authority tells the millennia-long story of the Jewish people, who—despite crises and very difficult periods—have always known how to rise again, rebuild, and thrive.'

Israel hiding Iran retaliation plans, angering Biden: Report	Israel no longer seeking American permission ahead of significant war moves, as the Biden administration seeks regional calm ahead of the November presidential election. By World Israel News Staff Israel has yet to disclose its plans to retaliate for Iran's massive ballistic missile barrage last week, angering Biden administration officials who are desperate for regional calm ahead of the U.S. presidential elections next month, according to a Wall Street Journal report. President Joe Biden has repeatedly called on Israel to avoid striking Iran's nuclear facilities or oil assets, moves which would likely spark a serious counter-attack from Iran. However, Israel will not commit to refraining from hitting those targets, the Journal reported. In recent months, Israel made several significant military decisions, including assassinating Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, without seeking American permission beforehand. The report described a terse interaction between Defense Minister Yoav Gallant informed his American counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, after the Nasrallah strike. 'Excuse me, what did you say?' Austin reportedly said, following Gallant relaying that the Israeli Air Force had bombed Nasrallah's Beirut compound. Later, Austin asked Gallant if Jerusalem was prepared to defend itself 'alone,' as the U.S. was not informed in time to prepare defenses for Israel. On Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was said to have delayed Gallant's trip to Washington, where he was set to discuss Iran attack plans with Austin. Netanyahu is expected to speak directly with Biden on Wednesday, after weeks of silence between the two, a source told Reuters. 'We want to use the call to try and shape the limitations of the Israeli retaliation,' a U.S. official told Axios. According to the Axios report, the U.S. 'wants to make sure Israel attacks targets in Iran that are significant without being disproportionate.' Last week, Iran launched some 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, in what is believed to be one of the largest barrages of its kind in history. At least 25 of those missiles impacted in Israel, both in open areas and causing damage to some Israeli air force bases, an army spokesman said.

US secretly negotiating Israeli ceasefire with Iran: Report	The Biden administration and Arab countries are asking Iran to rein in its proxies, who are attacking Israel on multiple fronts. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration and several Arab countries are currently engaged in talks with Iran, asking Tehran to rein in its proxy groups' multi-front attacks against Israel in exchange for a ceasefire agreement, according to a Channel 12 News report. The talks are aimed at seeing a ceasefire across multiple fronts, including Gaza and Lebanon, and for other Iranian-backed terror groups in the region, such as the Houthis in Yemen, to refrain from attacking Israel. Notably, Israel is not a party to the talks, though it has been made aware of the existence of the negotiations. An Israeli official told Channel 12 News that Jerusalem has yet to inform Washington regarding its stance on the discussions. 'We are currently in a position of power, a ceasefire will be on our terms, including a [Hezbollah] withdrawal beyond the Litani [River] and the dismantling of all military Hezbollah sites in areas near the border,' a senior Israeli official told the network. The report comes after prominent Hezbollah officials walked back their previous position that a ceasefire with Israel would require the withdrawal of IDF troops from the Gaza Strip. The terror group is now publicly expressing interest in a ceasefire that does not take Israeli military activity in the Strip into account, but is purely focused on Lebanon. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller noted in a press conference that Hezbollah's newfound openness to a ceasefire proposal demonstrated that the terror group had sustained serious damage. For a year, you had the world calling for this ceasefire, you had Hezbollah refusing to agree to one, and now that Hezbollah is on the back foot and is getting battered, suddenly they’ve changed their tune and want a ceasefire,' Miller said. However, Miller stressed that the Biden Administration 'ultimately wants a diplomatic solution to this conflict.'

Trump on hostage families: ‘Whatever I can do, I’ll do for them’	The former President was harshly critical of US President Joe Biden's policy on Iran, including the offer of $6 billion to the Islamic State as part of a prisoner swap. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Speaking to Ben Shapiro on his podcast at the Daily Wire, Donald Trump recounted meeting hostage families and saying, 'Whatever I can do, I'll do for them.' Trump recounted meeting the family of hostage Idan Alexander, an American citizen, during a ceremony commemorating the Hamas massacre on October 7th, a year on. 'They really don't know [if he is alive],' Trump said. 'It must be almost harder when they don't know; they're not sure whether or not he's alive or not alive. They think he is. But, you know, being alive over there is rough stuff. Before, it was rough, but now it's probably even rougher.' 'Whatever I can do, and you know this, whatever I can do, I'll do for them. Let's see what happens. Maybe I'll be able to help them. Hopefully, it's resolved long before that. But I can see the family is just going through hell. It is very, very sad to see,' Trump said. Regarding the Middle East in general, Trump discussed the success of the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and the UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, and Sudan. 'I did the Abraham Accords, which should have been filled in' with more Muslim countries, 'I would have had every one of the slots filled in. Biden got none. We had the four countries - four very good ones and four tough ones. The rest was just a fill-in job. We would have had total peace.' The former President was harshly critical of US President Joe Biden's policy on Iran, including the offer of $6 billion to the Islamic State as part of a prisoner swap. 'Iran was broke. We had no terrorism, we had no attacks, we had no Hamas problems, no Hezbollah problems. We had nothing, because Iran didn't have the money to give to them because I put sanctions on [Iran] and I dealt directly.' By the end of his term, Trump said Iran was 'Iran was ready to make a deal' by the end of his term,' Trump said. 'Biden should have made a deal. Iran was in a position [of weakness]. Instead, he gave them billions and billions of dollars. He took off the sanctions that I had. He took off everything, China started buying more oil than they ever bought before, and today Iran has $300 billion.' Following the October 7th terror attack, Biden faced strong criticism for the prisoner deal with Iran and the US agreed with Qatar not to release the $6 billion to Iran.

Hezbollah requests unconditional ceasefire	Qassem's statement implies that Hezbollah may be surrendering the demand for a ceasefire in Gaza as a precondition for a truce between Hezbollah and Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Naim Qassem, the most senior Hezbollah leader after the assassination of Nasrallah and his successor Safieddine, has called for an unconditional ceasefire, apparently not contingent on a cessation of fighting in Gaza. The former deputy to Hassan Nasrallah and member of Hezbollah's Jihad Council announced on Tuesday night that the terror group was 'agreeing to a ceasefire without preconditions. First, a ceasefire achieved through diplomatic means, and then we will discuss all the details.' Experts believe that the announcement was issued at the behest of Iran and was prompted by the terror proxy's military weakness after repeated Israeli strikes and assassinations of its leaders. Given that Qassem is the highest-ranking Hezbollah official remaining alive, the request for a ceasefire is apparently an official statement from the terror group. The request would entail both sides stopping the fighting before an agreement is mediated, most likely through the United Nations. Qassem added, 'If the enemy [Israel] continues its war, then the battlefield will decide.' He added that he relied on Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri to restore calm. 'We support the political activity being led by Berri under the title of a ceasefire,' Qassem said. The statement signals a change in position for Hezbollah since the terror group had indicated, since it began firing missiles into Israel on October 8th, that it would not stop hostilities until Israel submitted to a ceasefire agreement with Hamas in Gaza. Qassem's statement implies that Hezbollah may be surrendering the demand for a ceasefire in Gaza as a precondition for a truce between Hezbollah and Israel. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller explained that Israel has not yet accepted the ceasefire and that there is reason to distrust the request for a ceasefire from Hezbollah, particularly if the terror group refuses to retreat from Israel's northern border back to the Litani River, as it was supposed to do after the Second Lebanon War according to the terms of Resolution 1701. 'Obviously, we don't trust Hezbollah,' Miller said. 'But you look at what Hezbollah said in 2006 when the UN Security Council adopted 1701&#8230; that they would implement 1701 – and they blew through all of their commitments.' 'So there is an obvious lack of faith in Hezbollah's ability to do what it said in 2006 and do what it's saying it would do now, which is agree to an actual ceasefire that would allow Israeli civilians to return home and allow Lebanese civilians to return home,' the State Department spokesperson said. However, Miller said it was hopeful that Hezbollah had not spoken of a ceasefire in the 12 months of fighting and it was mentioning it now that the terror group is 'getting battered, suddenly they've changed their tune and want a ceasefire. I think it's not surprising given the situation they find themselves in,' he said.

Israeli strikes eliminated 6 Hezbollah commanders, 50 other terro...	During their operations in Lebanon, the IDF uncovered Hezbollah's plans to carry out an October 7th-style invasion of the northern border of Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel's military eliminated six senior Hezbollah commanders and 50 other terrorists through targeted strikes in Southern Lebanon on Monday. Israel's Air Force (IAF) was focused on targeting Hezbollah's southern Front, consisting of the Nasser Unit, Bader Unit, Aziz Unit, and the Radwan Forces. The Iran-backed terror group's strategy was to establish a Southern Front that would attack Israel above and underground. During their operations in Lebanon, the IDF uncovered Hezbollah's plans to carry out an October 7th-style invasion of the northern border of Israel. Monday's strikes were crucial in Israel's efforts to destroy this terrorist infrastructure and secure the border. The IAF carried out the strikes with precise guidance from the Intelligence Directorate in coordination with the Northern Command and Operations Directorate. In addition to eliminating terrorists, Israel's military destroyed a 25-meter tunnel that extended into Israel's territory. The six Hezbollah commanders who were killed in the strikes were identified as: Ahmad Hassan Nazal, head of the attack sector in Bint Jbeil for the Radwan Forces, Hussein Talal Kamal, head of the Ghajar sector, Musa Diab Barakat, outgoing head of the Ghajar sector, Mahmoud Mus Karnib, operations chief for the Ghajar sector, Ali Ahmad Ismail, artillery commander for the Bint Jbeil sector, and Abdullah Ali Dakik artillery commander for the Ghajar sector. Along with these 6 Hezbollah commanders, 44 other terrorists were eliminated. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed on Tuesday night that Israeli airstrikes killed Nasrallah's successor to head Hezbollah, Hashem Safieddine, who had been missing since October 3rd. During the address, Netanyahu urged Lebanese civilians to push out the Iran-controlled terror organization, Hezbollah, and to break their reins of control over Lebanon. 'We have degraded Hezbollah's capabilities; we took out thousands of terrorists, including [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah himself, and Nasrallah's replacement, and the replacement of his replacement,' Netanyahu stated. Safieddine, a maternal cousin of Nasrallah, was a cleric who wore a black turban, indicating direct descent from Mohammed. After a strike on Friday in Southern Beirut, Safieddine was assumed to have been severely injured in an area underground where it would have been difficult to escape alive. A Lebanese security official told Sky News Arabic that the chances of surviving such a strike were 'almost zero' and that Safieddine had been 'unreachable' since Friday.

A gang of tyrants and terrorists destroyed it. That's what happened,' Netanyahu said. Today, it's a place of chaos, a place of war,' Netanyahu stated. 'You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering, as we see in Gaza. It doesn't have to be that way,' Netanyahu said. 'I say to you, the people of Lebanon: Free your country from Hezbollah so that this war can end,' Netanyahu said. 'Free your country from Hezbollah so that your country can prosper again so that future generations of Lebanese and Israeli children will know neither war nor bloodshed but will finally live together in peace,' he said.

Sid Rosenberg: ‘We’re going to win, because we just win’	The previous day, on the first anniversary itself, Rosenberg toured the communities in the southwestern Negev and visited the site of the Nova Music Festival. By John Hasten, JNS New York conservative talk-radio show host Sid Rosenberg is back in Israel this week—to show his solidarity on the first anniversary of Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 massacre. Before broadcasting his four-hour, top-rated show, 'Sid & Friends in the Morning,' to his 77 WABC audience, live from the Jerusalem studios of JNS, he reflected on the atrocities that sparked the Swords of Iron war against Hamas in Gaza. 'A year later, it still feels like yesterday,' he told JNS on Tuesday. 'What’s tough here is that the war is still going on. In fact, now, with the war raging in the north, and the situation in Judea and Samaria, it’s a lot worse than we thought. That being said, there is hope.' The previous day, on the one-year anniversary itself, Rosenberg toured the communities in the southwestern Negev, and visited the site of the Nova Music Festival where some 400 Israelis were murdered. He then traveled to Sderot to record his program, but minutes before the show was to air, his crew had to seek shelter from an incoming barrage of Hamas rockets. 'Driving south was intense yesterday,' he recounted. 'Passing kibbutzim and the site of the Nova festival, and seeing people crying on the side of the roads, probably the relatives of those killed on Oct. 7. And then we get to Sderot, and end up in a bomb shelter, and immediately experience the reality of what it’s like living here. And that was just the first two hours of our trip.' The show proceeded smoothly, however, with Rosenberg hosting his good friend, former President (and current presidential candidate) Donald Trump over the phone. 'President Trump was quick to remind everybody how much he did for the State of Israel,' Rosenberg said. 'No president did what he did. He moved the U.S. embassy [to Jerusalem], which is what Israelis wanted; recognized the Golan Heights as part of Israel; put together the Abraham Accords; and stopped delivering palates of cash to the Palestinians, which ended up in the hands of Hamas. When he was president, he got along great with [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu. They’re both strong leaders and they’ll get along great again. So, if I’m living in Israel, I almost want Trump to win as much as I do living in Queens, New York.' When asked about the anti-Israel protests that have taken place throughout the U.S., especially on college campuses, since the beginning of the war, Rosenberg said that while they are disturbing, he still believes the American people stand with Israel. 'It is disheartening that there are thousands of people who side with a group [Hamas] that commits rape, murder, torture,' he said. 'But I still believe in my heart of hearts that the majority of people in the U.S. stand with Israel.' Rosenberg added, 'I don’t believe we are losing that war in terms of sheer numbers. They are a very loud minority; that’s the problem. And the media love to cover them, so it seems that everybody in the U.S. is pro-Hamas. That’s not the case, but there is work to be done.' Rosenberg is adamant that the Israeli hostages still held by Hamas be freed or rescued, but he’s outraged at those screaming at the Israeli government to 'bring them home,' rather than demanding that Hamas 'let them go.' 'That’s complete nonsense,' said Rosenberg. 'If Bibi [Netanyahu] had the choice to bring them home, he would bring them home. He doesn’t have that choice. He doesn’t have the hostages; [Yahya] Sinwar and Hamas do. So, what should be said is ‘let them go,’ not ‘bring them home,’ which puts the onus on Bibi.' Rosenberg is confident that Israel will achieve victory on all fronts in the war. 'We’re going to win, because we just win,' he asserts. 'We’re like the [Miami] Dolphins in 1973; they never lost a football game that year. That’s the last undefeated team.' He added, 'Look what happened just a few weeks ago. What other country or military can figure out sending beepers and walkie-talkies [to Hezbollah] and blowing off their fingers and making them blind.' He elaborated, 'Our intelligence here in Israel is so far and away the best in the world. I understand we got caught flat-footed on Oct. 7, and maybe one day Bibi will pay a price for that, but since the war has started, there is nobody better. And even though we are outnumbered, we have the intelligence, the weaponry, the capability. We will win all these wars on all these fronts, I promise you that.' When asked to share a few last thoughts before sitting in the broadcaster’s chair, Rosenberg said, 'I had never been to Israel in 57 years, and now I’m back here for the second time in a matter of months thanks to the One Israel Fund [a pro-Israel non-profit organization that sponsored his trip], and I love it here. There is a spirit from the people that you just don’t find any place else. There is nothing like this country.' He concluded, 'Even what these people have gone through, they are going to smile the next day; they are going to be sincere and proud to be Jewish, alive and well. I really believe these are the best people in the world, here in Israel.'

Artless dodger: Harris flustered in substance-free 60 minutes int...	There's no telling how confounding Harris's answers must have been in real time. By Andrew Stiles and Thaleigha Rampersad, The Washington Free Beacon Vice President Kamala Harris went on 60 Minutes and attempted to answer some of the toughest questions she's faced—a low bar—since taking over the Democratic nomination from 81-year-old Joe Biden, who is technically still the president. She was meandering and evasive throughout the interview with Bill Whitaker of CBS News, who had to politely repeat the question on several occasions. There's no telling how confounding Harris's answers must have been in real time. The network's producers saw fit to liberally (and sloppily) edit the conversation. They included a considerable amount of overdubbed editorializing from Whitaker, as if he were translating Harris's remarks into basic English. They made clear at the outset that Harris's opponent, Donald Trump, declined to participate. 'Harris says she’ll press Congress to pass a federal ban on price-gouging for food and groceries, but details are yet to be defined,' Whitaker said in post-production remarks as Harris continued to ramble on screen at a low volume. He was attempting to translate Harris's answer to his question about rampant inflation during the Biden-Harris administration. 'We now have an economy that is thriving by all macroeconomic measures,' Harris bragged before struggling to articulate a plan that would help normal Americans who don't follow macroeconomic trends. 'Prices are still too high, and I know that. And we need to deal with it, which is why part of my plan—you mentioned groceries—part of my plan is what we must do to bring down the price of groceries.' Got that? At one point Whitaker interrupted Harris's talking points about how 'small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy' to insist she explain how she would pay for all her spending proposals. She said it could all be paid for by raising taxes on rich people and rejected Whitaker's suggestion that Congress was unlikely to approve new tax hikes. 'You know, when you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about because their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about,' the vice president alleged. 'I am a devout public servant, you know that. But I am also a capitalist.' Harris is also an alleged gun owner. 'I have a Glock, and I've had it for quite some time,' she told Whitaker. 'And, I mean, look. My background is in law enforcement, and, so there you go.' Of course she has fired it, the VP cackled, at a shooting range. Whitaker asked Harris a question many so-called journalists have had the opportunity to ask but for some reason have not: How does she explain her numerous reversals on the (radical left-wing) policy positions she espoused as a candidate in 2019? What was her message to critics who argued that 'people don't truly know' where she stands? Her answer failed to include an explanation or message beyond a saccharine appeal to common sense. 'I have been traveling our country, and I have been listening to folks, and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground,' Harris said before producers cut to a different clip, presumably out of mercy. 'I believe in building consensus. We are a diverse people, geographically, regionally, in terms of where we are in our backgrounds, and what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus, where we can figure out compromise, and understand it's not a bad thing, as long as you don't compromise your values, to find common sense solutions. And that has been my approach.' Alas, Whitaker declined to intervene or ask Harris what the hell she was talking about. 'I believe in my soul and heart, the American people are ready to turn the page,' said Harris, who has served as vice president since January 2021. Whitaker pointed this out while attempting to get Harris to explain why illegal immigration surged on her watch. 'Solutions are at hand,' she alleged. 'The policies that we have been proposing have been about fixing a problem not about promoting a problem, OK?' Harris was equally out of her depth when trying to discuss America's relationship with Israel and the threat of regional war in the Middle East. 'The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,' she said. 'The work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of, many things including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.' Harris was less artful when dodging Whitaker's question about whether as president she would support NATO membership for Ukraine. That was one of the 'issues that we will deal with.' Harris's befuddled running mate, Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, also took questions, including one about the criticism he's received for 'embellishing and telling outright falsehoods' about his military service and other aspects of his resume, including his whopper about being in China during the Tiananmen Square uprising in 1989. Walz's answer was only slightly better than the atrocious word salad he unleashed during last week's vice presidential debate against Republican J.D. Vance. 'I think folks know who I am, and I think they know the difference between someone expressing emotion, telling a story, getting a date wrong by a—rather than a pathological liar like Donald Trump,' Walz said. But could he be trusted to tell the truth? 'Yeah, well, I can. I think I can,' the governor shrugged. 'I will own up to being a knucklehead at times.' It's not yet known how many Americans tuned in to watch the interview. CBS News, by far the lowest-rated network in evening news, is still reeling from the backlash surrounding the VP debate, when moderators Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell pestered Vance with dubious 'fact checks.' On Tuesday, the network is holding an all-staff trauma training session with Dr. Donald Grant, a diversity and mental health consultant, after CBS executives denounced their own anchor, Tony Dokoupil, for challenging author Ta-Nehisi Coates's one-sided account of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Dr. Grant's social media posts include a blatantly racist image of Sen. Tim Scott (R., S.C.) alongside the caption 'Uncle Tim's Cabin,' a racially-charged term of disparagement.

US Treasury Department targets international charities, individua...	OFAC levied sanctions on the implicated actors, banning their organizations and transactions from operating in the United States and mandating their reporting to the agency. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner The US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has identified three individuals and one charity as having significant financial ties to the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. In a statement released on Monday, the one-year anniversary of Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre across southern Israel, OFAC announced new sanctions against the entities spotlighted by its investigation and noted they play integral roles in funding Hamas’s terrorism ventures under the guise of 'charitable work.' The department said that the investigation was part of its efforts to surface abuses by self-described 'charity organizations' really working to financially support terrorist groups. 'As we mark one year since Hamas’s brutal terrorist attack, Treasury will continue relentlessly degrading the ability of Hamas and other destabilizing Iranian proxies to finance their operations and carry out additional violent acts,' US Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said in a statement. 'The Treasury Department will use all available tools at our disposal to hold Hamas and its enablers accountable, including those who seek to exploit the situation to secure additional sources of revenue.' 'Treasury is committed to exposing terrorists and terrorist organizations that abuse the NPO sector. By publicly identifying a sham charity, this action reduces the overall risk of the NPO sector and helps preserve access by legitimate humanitarian organizations to financial services,' OFAC added in a statement. The Treasury Department identified Hamid Abdullah Hussein al Ahmar (al Ahmar), a Yemeni national living in Turkey, as an influential and prolific financier of Hamas. According the US government announcement, al Ahmar has served as the chairman of the Al-Quds International Foundation, a charity organization controlled by Hamas. In addition, OFAC identified nine entities controlled by Ahmar — Al Ahmar Trading Group, Al Ahmar Oils Supply and Distribution, Sama International Media, Al Salam Trading and Agencies General Establishment, Saba, Trade & Investment S.R.O, Sabafon International SAL, Sabaturk Dis Ticaret Anonim Sirketi, Vivid Enerji Yatirimlari Anonim Sirketi, Investrade Portfoy Yonetimi Anonim Sirketi — as potentially having ties to Hamas’s operations. The agency also flagged a cohort of Hamas funders based in European countries. Italy-based Hamas member Mohammad Hannoun runs the 'Charity Association of Solidarity with the Palestinian People,' according to OFAC, which said the so-called 'charity' actually operates as a fundraising effort for Hamas’s military wing. Hannoun has been designated by OFAC for 'having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services in support of, Hamas.' Germany-based Hamas member Majed al-Zeer helps spearhead the terrorist group’s European fundraising initiatives, OFAC claimed, adding that he has 'appeared publicly with other senior Hamas members in order to generate funding and other support for Hamas.' Adel Doughman leads Hamas’s Austrian activities and is 'one of the most prominent Hamas representatives in Europe,' according to OFAC. Doughman has also maintained high-ranking positions in Europe-based organizations that have allegedly funneled money to the terrorist group. Both Al-Zeer and Doughman 'are being designated for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Hamas,' OFAC wrote. OFAC also highlighted Hamas’s use of 'unlicenced' financial institutions such as Al-Intaj Bank to help facilitate their activities. The Hamas government in Gaza granted the alleged terrorist-supporting bank a 'permit' to operate in the Palestinian enclave. The bank 'provides financial services for Hamas despite not being connected to international banks,' OFAC said. OFAC levied sanctions on the implicated actors, banning their organizations and transactions from operating in the United States and mandating their reporting to the agency. 'As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above, and of any entities that are owned directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by them, individually, or with other blocked persons, that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC,' the agency wrote. In the year following Hamas’s Oct. 7 slaughter of 1,200 individuals in southern Israel, US federal agencies have identified a flood of terrorist-tied fundraising and information efforts on American soil. In July, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines warned that 'actors tied to Iran’s government' have encouraged and provided financial support to rampant protests opposing Israel’s war against Hamas. Iran has for years provided Hamas with weapons, funding, and training.

Three Hamas Oct. 7 perpetrators killed in Israeli strikes	The two operations were a joint effort of the Israel Defense Forces and Israel Security Agency and were carried out by the Israeli Air Force. By JNS Israel revealed on Tuesday that last week three Hamas terrorists who participated in the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre were killed in two separate airstrikes in the Gaza Strip. Mhuammad Rafa’i, a terrorist from Hamas’s Gaza Brigade who took part in the Oct. 7 attack in the areas of Kfar Aza and Nahal Oz, was killed in an attack on a Hamas command and control center embedded inside the Shuja’iyya school in Gaza City’s Daraj Tuffah district. Additionally, Rafa’i was involved in terror activities against IDF troops and Israeli civilians. Another strike, in Rafah on Oct. 1, killed Hamas terrorists Muhammad Zinon and Basel Ahras, who participated in the Oct. 7 massacre and plotted terror attacks against Israeli civilians. The two operations were a joint effort of the Israel Defense Forces and Israel Security Agency and were carried out by the Israeli Air Force. 'The IDF and the ISA will continue to operate against Hamas terrorists involved in the deadly Oct. 7 massacre,' the statement said. Twenty terrorists killed in Jabaliya area Meanwhile, Israeli forces continue to operate in Jabaliya in northern Gaza to root out a Hamas resurgence there, killing 20 terrorists over the past 24 hours. Troops also located a weapons storage facility and found weapons, including grenades and AK-47 rifles. במהלך היממה האחרונה כוחות אוגדה 162 חיסלו כ-20 מחבלים מהאוויר ובקרבות פנים אל פנים במרחב ג'באליה.כוחות צוות הקרב של חטיבה 401 השמידו מחסן אמצעי לחימה, ואיתרו אמצעי לחימה רבים ביניהם רימונים ונשקים מסוג 'קלאצ'ניקוב'>> pic.twitter.com/WTMfJPAXyC &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) October 8, 2024 In central Gaza, troops continued to dismantle terrorist infrastructure sites and eliminate terrorists in targeted raids.

Hezbollah launches over 100 rockets at Haifa as terror chief says...	Lebanese terrorists launch largest-yet barrage on northern Israeli city of Haifa, as Hezbollah's deputy chief declares the group remains combat effective despite major Israeli attacks on its leadership. By World Israel News Staff Hezbollah terrorists operating out of southern Lebanon launched over 100 rockets at the northern Israeli city of Haifa and its environs Tuesday afternoon in a pair of barrages, marking the largest attack on the city since October 7th, 2023. Sirens were sounded across the Haifa Bay area, Akko, and surrounding towns beginning at 12:11 p.m., with a second barrage detected at 12:43/ Most of the incoming projectiles were either intercepted by Israel's missile defense networks or landed in open spaces, the IDF said, though at least one rocket struck homes in Haifa, along with some damage reported in Kiryat Yam and Kiryat Motzkin outside of Haifa. One person, a woman in her 70s, was injured in Haifa after being struck by shrapnel, the Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency first responder organization said. The woman is listed in light-to-moderate condition. Amid the attacks Tuesday, Naim Qassem, the deputy chief of Hezbollah and de facto leader following the assassination of Hezbollah executive council chief Hassan Nasrallah last month and the apparent killing of his successor, Hashem Safieddine in an airstrike last Thursday, denied that the terror group's capabilities had been curtailed by Israel's attacks. 'You see that our daily accomplishments are great,' Qassem said on Iranian television. 'Hundreds of rockets and dozens of [drone attacks], a great number of [Israeli] settlements and cities have come under rocket fire.' 'I would like to reassure you that our capabilities are fine.' Despite the elimination of Hezbollah's chief and the disappearance and apparent killing of his successor, Qassem said the group had 'no vacant posts.' In an apparent nod to Safieddine's disappearance following an October 3rd Israeli airstrike in Beirut, Qassem said Hezbollah would soon appoint a new leader.

Nova survivor reveals she witnessed rape on Oct. 7 at Tel Aviv me...	We saw murder, kidnappings, but the hardest of them all was rape,' she said. 'I have never heard screams for help like the ones I heard from that woman.' By Deborah Danan, JTA As the sun dipped over Tel Aviv’s Yarkon Park and families of Hamas’ victims and hostages began trickling in for an Oct. 7 memorial, a siren blared, warning of a missile fired from Yemen that forced everyone to the ground, their hands shielding their heads. It was a stark reminder that the war begun a year ago was far from over. The event — organized as a counterpoint to the official state-led ceremony, which many of the grieving families boycotted — was supposed to be much larger. The 50,000 tickets allotted for the event were reserved within hours of their release, but due to wartime restrictions on large gatherings, attendance was limited to press and victims’ families. The scaled-back audience — and a larger crowd viewing from all over the world by livestream — heard musical performances from a host of celebrities, political outrage from families who feel abandoned by Israel’s government and chilling testimony from Oct. 7 survivors. In a video broadcast at the event, Yuval Sharvit Trabelsi, who survived the Nova massacre but lost her husband Mor there, revealed for the the first time that she witnessed rape while trying to evade Hamas terrorists. 'We saw murder, kidnappings, but the hardest of them all was rape,' she said. 'I have never heard screams for help like the ones I heard from that woman.' She went on to recount how she smeared herself with her husband’s blood so that the terrorists would think she was dead. In all, more than 360 people were killed at the Nova festival. As on Oct. 7 last year, a Hamas-fired rocket had triggered sirens in Tel Aviv earlier in the day, a sign that the terror group still poses a danger after a yearlong campaign by the Israeli military to eliminate it. But Linda Trabelsi, Mor’s mother, said the threat of rockets didn’t deter her from attending the memorial service. 'Not coming wasn’t an option,' she told JTA. But she said the anniversary was not her hardest day. 'No, Oct. 7, 2023, was the hardest day,' she said. 'And after that? Every day since.' But she noted that September had been especially difficult, as it included both Mor’s birthday and what would have been his first wedding anniversary. Many families of victims and hostages blame the government for failing to prevent the Hamas attack, when thousands of terrorists stormed Israel’s southern border en masse, killing some 1,200 people, abducting more than 250 to Gaza and perpetrating the worst one-day attack in Israel’s history. And in the year since the attack, many hostage families say the government could have — and should have — done more to secure their freedom. 'Instead of standing here in multitudes as a united people of Israel, we wait for the next siren,' said co-organizer Yonatan Shamriz, the brother of Alon Shamriz, who was taken captive and later killed by Israeli soldiers in a case of mistaken identity. 'Instead of a state investigative commission being formed to investigate this colossal failure, we are left asking the questions ourselves, without getting any answers,' he said. 'There is no personal example, no vision, no leadership, no accountability.' Shamriz’s anger was reflected in the split-screen reality of the day: In contrast to the Tel Aviv event, the official state ceremony was prerecorded weeks ago and featured speeches by the leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom the hostage families blame for not rescuing their loved ones from the tunnels of Gaza. There is broad Israeli support for an intensified effort to release the hostages. A survey released on Monday by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 62% of Israelis said freeing the captives should be the main goal of the war, and most said the war in Gaza should be ended, in part to avoid endangering the hostages’ lives. But Netanyahu focused his speech on defeating Hamas, which he listed first among the war’s aims, and vowed to continue the fight. 'We mustn’t stop the war prematurely,' he said. 'As long as the enemy threatens our existence and the peace of our country, we will continue to fight. As long as our hostages are still in Gaza, we will continue to fight. We will not forsake any of them. I will not give up. As long as our citizens have not returned to their homes safely, we will continue to fight.' Doron Weiss, who attended the Tel Aviv memorial in honor of his nephew, captive soldier Matan Angrest, also voiced anger at Israel’s leadership. Last month, his sister, Anat Angrest, played a recently unearthed audio clip of her son speaking from Gaza — the first sign of life since his abduction. 'I’m finished with tears. We’ve been living this hell for a year. We know our leaders are not doing everything they can to release them, and it stings,' Weiss told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. Several Jewish communal leaders also attended the Tel Aviv event, including William Daroff, CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, and Eric Fingerhut, president and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America. Daroff, who was leading a solidarity mission, focused his rebuke not on Netanyahu but on Israel’s allies in the wake of the attack. 'Our allies weren’t there standing with us at the end of the day. As Jews we can only really count on Jews,' he said. 'When Israel bleeds, American Jews bleed and when Israel cries American Jews cry. That’s become a standard since Oct. 7.' British-Israeli Gaby Young Shalev, whose brother Nathanel Young, a soldier, was killed in action on Oct. 7, said today was the 'first day it really hit' her. She described the months following her brother’s murder as a whirlwind of otherwise happy life events, including her parents’ aliyah, two of her siblings giving birth, and the arrival of her own twins. 'And even though we speak about Nat every day, talking about projects and ways we can commemorate him, it’s almost like a distraction from the truth,' she said. 'Then, at these kinds of events, when people send messages and send their support, you kind of realize this is actually real. It makes you realize the extent of it, and the fact that there are thousands of other families going through the same thing is just even more tragic.' She added, 'Every time I see another fallen soldier’s name, it’s hard, knowing more families are going to go through the same cycle. Especially when they’ve served quietly in Gaza for months, only to fall after all that.' Yigal Cohen took to the stage and recounted how his daughter, a surveillance soldier at the Nahal Oz base, was 'murdered barefoot, in her pajamas.' 'The blood of our daughters cries out to us from the earth. We cannot be silent. We will not leave, we will not forget, and we will not grow weary,' he said. At the conclusion of his speech, in a symbolic gesture calling for the release of the five surveillance soldiers still held captive in Gaza, he released five yellow balloons into the air. A common refrain from Israelis — and especially hostage families — is that they are still living the hell of last Oct. 7. One year later, that anguish that was evident at the ceremony in Tel Aviv. 'Tal’s children, Neve and Yahel, keep asking: Where’s Dad? When will he come back? When Dad comes back, will he be very old?' said Nitza Korngold, mother of hostage Tal Shoham. 'In which country are these the questions a 9-year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl ask?'

Britain’s prime minister rejects call for broad arms embargo on I...	A wrong position' - PM Keir Starmer shoots down proposed ban on all arms sales to Israel, even after his government suspended dozens of contracts with Israel. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The United Kingdom will not impose a sweeping arms embargo on Israel, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer declared Monday on the first anniversary of the Hamas invasion of Israel. After addressing Members of Parliament on Monday, Starmer fielded questions from lawmakers, including one posed by Coventry South's representative, MP Zarah Sultana. Sultana, a member of the Labour Party who is in the midst of a six-month suspension, claimed that over 118,000 people have died in the Gaza war thus far - nearly triple the figure claimed by Hamas' own health ministry - and asked Starmer whether he would back a comprehensive ban on arms sales to Israel. 'In light of Israel's genocidal assault in Gaza, the violence in the West Bank, and the invasion of Lebanon, I ask the prime minister if he believes Israel's right to self-defense justifies a death toll - which according to research by medical professionals in the U.S. who have worked in Gaza has now surpassed 118,000 as well as the 2,000 people killed in Lebanon - will he do what is morally and legally right and end the government's complicity in war crimes by banning arms sales to Israel, including F-35 fighter jets, not just 30 licenses, yes or no?' Starmer's government has already suspended 30 arms contracts with Israel, Foreign Secretary David Lammy revealed last month, while some 320 contracts remain in place. Responding to Sultana's question, Starmer said: 'No.' 'But it is a really serious point. Banning all sales would mean none for defensive purposes.' 'None for defensive purposes on the anniversary of October 7 and days after a huge attack by Iran into Israel would be a wrong position for this government and I will not take it,' Starmer continued.

Israel has ‘one-time opportunity’ to smash Iran’s nuclear sites	Former prime minister Naftali Bennett says Israel must act now and strike Iran's nuclear facilities. By World Israel News Staff Former prime minister Naftali Bennett urged the Israeli government to defy pressure from the Biden Administration and launch a devasting attack on Iran's nuclear assets. Israel has yet to respond to a direct attack from Iran last week, which saw the Islamic Republic launch some 200 ballistic missiles targeting sites in Israel in what is believed to be one of the largest attacks of its kind in history. 'President Biden has said that Israel can retaliate against Iran, but must keep the response 'proportionate'. The president also urged Israel not to attack Iran’s nuclear program,' Bennett wrote on social media platform X. 'Now that the main proxies of Iran's terror, Hezbollah and Hamas, are weakened Israel finally has an opportunity to strike Iran's nuclear program,' Bennet said. 'This is a one-time opportunity, and we cannot miss it,' he continued. 'This will take some time, but this week’s response must start this process,' he added. 'If we don’t take out the nuclear program now, I don’t know we’ll ever do it. The mullah regime has acquired SQ10, which means enough high grade uranium to produce 10 nuclear bombs. The regime is racing towards producing the detonator device itself, while the world can no longer really track this,' he warned. In recent years, Iran has barred international inspectors from its nuclear sites. Although the Iranian government claims its nuclear program is strictly for civilian purposes, it has begun stepping up enrichment of uranium. Watchdog groups have warned that Iran likely has the capabilities to create enough enriched uranium for at least one nuclear-grade weapon within a week's time. 'We might wake up to a test bomb exploding in Iran’s desert. At that moment the Middle East will become a nuclear nightmare. We have the justification and the ability. It’s time to act now,' Bennett added.

Hezbollah’s logistics chief killed in Israeli airstrike	The logistics headquarters which Husseini led was in charge of the terror group’s budgeting and management of various units. By Pesach Benson, TPS Hezbollah’s logistics chief, Suhail Hussein Husseini, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in the Beirut area, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed on Tuesday morning. 'Husseini played a crucial role in weapon transfers between Iran and Hezbollah and was responsible for distributing the advanced weaponry among Hezbollah’s units, overseeing both the transportation and allocation of these arms. Additionally, he was a member of the Jihad council, Hezbollah’s senior military leadership council,' the IDF said. The logistics headquarters which Husseini led was in charge of the terror group’s budgeting and management of various units. The headquarters also included Hezbollah’s Research and Development Unit, which is responsible for manufacturing precision-guided missiles and managing the storage and transportation of weapons in Lebanon. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, the Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities, killing 49 people. According to figures released by the government on Sept. 29, more than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. Israel’s war goals include securely returning northern residents to their homes. Israeli officials demand Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from southern Lebanon in compliance with UN Security Council resolution 1701 which ended the Second Lebanon War of 2006. This includes all areas south of the Litani River such as the cities of Nabatieh and Tyre, as well as the Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.

‘They can never defeat us’: Jewish students commemorate Oct. 7 vi...	It still feels like Oct. 8, because we’re still missing our loved ones,' GW Chabad president Sabrina Soffer said during an interview on Monday. By Dion J. Pierre, The Algemeiner Jewish students at George Washington University in Washington, DC came together on Saturday to commemorate the lives of the kidnapped and deceased ahead of the one-year anniversary of Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre across southern Israel, a tragedy which claimed more Jewish lives in one day than any since the Holocaust. Organized by Chabad GW, the event — titled 'Remember, Resolve, Rededicate' — was held at Kogan Plaza, a section of campus that has seen both memorials to the victims of Hamas’s barbarism and celebrations of their afflictions led by pro-Hamas activists. On Saturday, however, a generation of Jewish students whose lives and conceptions of self have been upended by the events of the past year claimed the space as exclusively theirs, transforming it into a realm of healing and perseverance. Speaking to The Algemeiner on Monday, several students who attended the gathering remarked on the swiftness of the passage of time and why, one year removed from Oct. 7, it still feels like only the day after. 'It still feels like Oct. 8, because we’re still missing our loves ones,' GW Chabad president Sabrina Soffer said during an interview on Monday. 'Israel is such a small country, and there, everyone is like family. We’re still missing over 100 people; we’ve lost so many, people are displaced from their homes — and the war is still ongoing and only escalating from here. I just hope that Israel will achieve victory. I want the war to end, but Israel must win.' The presence at the vigil of those seemingly hostile to those gathered in support of Israel and the Jewish community also shrunk the distance between one year ago and now. At one point, a young woman wearing a keffiyeh roamed through the crowd, taking pictures of the students as they listened to speeches and comforted one another. She did not disclose what the pictures were for nor which media outlet she represented. 'It was an amazing visualization, the more I think about it,' freshman Nate Neutstadt told The Algemeiner. 'We’re here together as a community celebrating life, celebrating love, and on the other hand, there were people coming up to us trying to fuel the fire and spread hate.' A native of San Diego, California, Neutstadt chose to attend GW — which he described as his 'dream school' for its highly reputed school of international affairs — fully aware that every day on campus would see his Jewish identity scrutinized and maligned. Resisting any notion that Jewish identity can be driven underground, he accepted the challenge. The unknown woman was one of many obstacles against which he, as well as other first-year Jewish students, had steeled themselves long ago. Soon, she became an afterthought. No one photographed her in return. 'We were all just here in the moment, celebrating. And I think all of our mindsets at this point is that they’re going to do what they’re going to do and we’re going to be here celebrating life and love,' he added, explaining that he intends to fight hatred with Jewish pride. 'There’s so much hate going around towards Jews just over our existing, and I think the best way to fight against it is to be a proud Jew, to live Jewish life in the face of hate. Because no matter what these antisemites try to do, chanting in the streets ‘intifada, intifada,’ they can never defeat us.' Others, such as senior Ari Shapiro, have experienced an awakening of Jewish identity in the post-Oct 7. world. Throughout most of his life, Shapiro explained, Jewishness was an overlooked component of his identity, a detail of his biography which entitled him to a bar mitzvah but was attenuated by the comfort and banality of suburbia. 'I’m in a different boat than some of the others Jewish students you’ll talk to,' he said. 'Before Oct. 7, 2023, I had never really considered what it meant to be Jewish. I never really felt an attachment to the identity or had even considered it to be a barrier between me and anyone else who wasn’t Jewish. That’s ironic, I know, given my name, which doesn’t get more Jewish than that. But seeing how Hamas butchered and slaughtered thousands of people, many of whom were part of the kibbutzim, which is usually the farther left group in Israel; and then seeing people on this campus demonstrate in support of their killers — that forced me to realize that no matter how much I made being Jewish as part of my identity, I would still share in the fate of others whose Judaism and Jewishness is the basis of how they are perceived by the world.' For Natasha Halbfinger, who lived in Israel for four years during adolescence, Oct. 7 affirmed values in which she has always believed. 'We, as the Jewish people, will continue to be proud of our identities,' she proclaimed during a speech delivered on Saturday night. 'We will not be Jews with trembling knees. We will continue to turn horror into beautiful celebrations of life — because Am Israel Chai.

CIA head: Israel’s ‘misjudgment’ could spark regional war	CIA director appears to claim that Israel responding to Iranian attack could trigger widespread escalation in the ongoing Middle East conflict. By World Israel News Staff The head of the Central Intelligence Agency said that despite an international push for calm, the prospect of a widespread regional war in the Middle East remains a looming threat. CIA director Bill Burns appeared to shift the onus of responsibility for the potential worsening of the war on Israel, saying that Jerusalem must respond cautiously to Iran's recent ballistic missile attack. 'We face the very real danger of a further regional escalation of conflict,' Burns said at the Cipher Brief Annual Threat Conference in Georgia on Monday. 'The Middle East is a place where complicated stuff happens all the time,' he continued. Burns said he believed that Israel's leadership was 'weighing very carefully' potential responses to Iran's unprecedented attack, which marked the second time in 2024 that Tehran directly attacked the Jewish State. But, Burns said, 'misjudgments' on the part of Israel could trigger an escalation of the conference. During his remarks, Burns did not include the context that Iranian proxy groups, including the Lebanon-based Hezbollah terror group and the Houthis in Yemen, have repeatedly attacked Israel across multiple fronts in the past year. The CIA head also downplayed the Iranian nuclear threat, claiming that 'we do not see evidence today that the Supreme Leader has reversed the decision that he took at the end of 2003 to suspend the weaponization program.' Burns then admitted that Iran had stepped up is uranium enrichment, and could potentially create enough of the material for a nuclear bomb within a week's time. In recent months, the Biden administration has attempted to rein in Israel's military campaign against Hezbollah and other terror groups, likely due to concerns of the war escalating before the November presidential elections in the U.S. Analysts have noted that Washington appears to have waning influence on Jerusalem, as decisions such as the assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah were made without the U.S. being informed prior to the strike.
