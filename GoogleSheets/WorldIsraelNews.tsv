Key House committee replaces ‘West Bank’ with Judea & Samaria’	Republican effort to have the historical terminology 'Judea and Samaria' replace the 20th century term 'West Bank' gains momentum, with critical House committee instructing staffers to make the change. By World Israel News Staff A key committee in the House of Representatives has taken a step towards changing the terminology used to describe the territories occupied by Jordan from 1948 to 1967 before being captured by Israeli forces during the Six Day War. According to a report by Axios Wednesday night, the chairman of the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee has instructed all Republican staffers working with the committee to use the term 'Judea and Samaria' in place of the term 'West Bank.' Florida Republican Brian Mast, chairman of the committee, issued the instructions Tuesday according to a memo obtained by Axios. 'In recognition of our unbreakable bond with Israel and the inherent right of the Jewish people to their ancient homeland,' Mast wrote, 'the House Foreign Affairs committee will, from here forward, refer to the West Bank as Judea and Samaria in formal correspondence, communication and documentation.' 'As representatives of the American people, we must do our part to stem this reprehensible tide of antisemitism and recognize Israel's rightful claim to the cradle of Jewish civilization.' While the move only impacts the roughly 50 Republican staffers on the committee, and does not compel staffers for Democratic lawmakers on the committee, it marks the first step in a larger effort by the GOP in Congress to shift from the use of the Jordanian term 'West Bank,' to the biblical names of the two areas, Judea and Samaria, included in the territory. After capturing Judea and Samaria during the 1948-1949 Israeli War of Independence, Jordan annexed the territory in 1950, renaming the combined territories as Cisjordan or alternatively, the West Bank, in contrast to the rest of the Hashemite kingdom, located on the East Bank of the River Jordan. House and Senate Republicans have in recent years pushed legislative measures to formally replace the term 'West Bank' with 'Judea and Samaria' in all federal documents. With Trump's election last November, New York Rep. Claudia Tenney and Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton resumed their efforts to pass legislation altering the terminology used by the federal government.

Hamas preparing for new round of fighting with Israel – report	With end of first phase of ceasefire just days away and no agreement one phase two in sight, Gaza terror group reportedly rushing to repair tunnels and terror infrastructure and redeploy armed forces for new round of fighting with Israel. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization is actively preparing for a new round of fighting with Israel The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, as talks for the implementation of the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal continue in Doha, Qatar. The first phase of the ceasefire is slated to end this coming Sunday, and with no comprehensive deal in the offing in the brokered talks in Doha, Hamas is said to be quietly gearing up for resumed fighting in the Gaza Strip. Anonymous sources informed the Journal that the Islamist terror group is in the midst of planning the redeployment of it forces across Gaza, in preparation for possible Israeli incursions. Hamas is also said to be rebuilding terror tunnels and restoring other infrastructure critical for hostilities with IDF ground forces. The report claimed that Izz al-Din al-Haddad, the commander of Hamas' military forces in the northern Gaza Strip, met this month with other senior Hamas officials to draft plans for a new round of hostilities with Israel. The terror group is also working frantically to train new combatants to replace terrorists killed in the war with Israel. In addition, Hamas is said to be expanding its efforts to identify Gazans who have collaborated with Israel. On Wednesday, Hamas issued a statement rejecting President Donald Trump's Gaza resettlement plan, and demanding an end to the 'ongoing Israeli occupation.' 'Unfortunately, Trump is reintroducing ideas that do not take into account the culture and interests of the Palestinian people,' Hamas politburo member and former Gaza health minister Bassem Naim said. 'Our goal is not to improve prison conditions, but to end the occupation and be free of it.' Hamas has thus far rejected Israel's demands at the Doha talks for the disarmament and removal of Hamas forces from Gaza as a condition for implementation of the second phase of the ceasefire deal. Egyptian and Qatari brokers have suggested the two sides extend the current arrangement temporarily, should no comprehensive deal be reached by the March 2nd deadline.

Israeli sentenced to 7 years in Malaysian prison	Police were suspicious that Avitan was a Mossad spy, but eventually accepted his explanation that he was there to settle a dispute with another criminal. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli known to be involved in organized crime was sentenced by a Malaysian court to seven years in prison, accepting a plea bargain after he was charged with weapons offenses. Shalom Avitan entered Malaysia, which has no diplomatic relations with Israel, using a French passport, according to a report from Hebrew-language outlet Mako. Avitan was said to have traveled to the Muslim country in April 2024 with the goal of assassinating another Israeli organized crime figure, Eran Haya, with whom he had an ongoing criminal disputer in Israel. He was arrested after purchasing weapons and ammunition from a local Malaysian couple, who are also facing criminal charges. Several days after his arrival in Malaysia, police raided Avitan's hotel room in Kuala Lumpur, seizing six guns and 158 bullets. Initially, police were suspicious that Avitan was a Mossad spy, but eventually accepted his explanation that he was there to settle a dispute with another criminal. The trial was postponed multiple times due to Avitan's demand for a Hebrew-language interpreter. One could not be found locally, and due to the lack of relations between Malaysia and Israel, a Hebrew interpreter could not be brought from the Jewish State. After numerous delays, Avitan opted to accept a plea deal of seven years in prison. Avitan is 'being held in difficult conditions,' a friend told Mako. 'The prisons in the country are that of a third-world country, and even worse. I hope for his sake that he survives prison.' The southeast Asian country maintains a hostile public stance towards Israel. In January 2025, Malaysia's Foreign Ministry 'unequivocally' condemned Israeli military activity in the Strip, claiming that the IDF engages in 'incessant and targeted' actions against civilians. In December 2023, Malaysia banned Israeli ships from docking at its ports due to the IDF's military campaign against Hamas.

Jewish rock star to Yarden Bibas: ‘Stay strong, brother’	May the memories of your beloved children and your wife, Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir, be a blessing to you. Always,' Disturbed's lead singer tells Yarden Bibas. By World Israel News Staff The lead singer of a prominent rock band recorded a heartfelt message to Yarden Bibas on Wednesday, after the bereaved father chose one of his songs to play at his family's funeral. The funeral of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas featured the song 'Hold On To The Memories' by the alternative metal band Disturbed. The band's lead singer and lyricist, David Draiman, is Jewish and a strong supporter of Israel. Draiman posted a video to his Instagram account, in which he directly addressed Yarden Bibas. 'Dear, dear Yarden. Shalom achi [hello my brother.] I am so, so very sorry for your loss. All of Am Israel [the Jewish people] is crying with you today. Hold on to the memories of your family, of your children, of your beloved wife. We all will,' Draiman said. 'As long as we hold them in our memory, they'll stay there. May the memories of your beloved children and your wife, Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir, be a blessing to you. Always,' he continued. 'Am Israel Chai achi [the people of Israel live.] Stay strong,' Draiman concluded. Since the onset of the October 7th war, Draiman has used social media to combat anti-Israel and pro-Hamas narratives. In March 2024, a video of Draiman speaking to the crowd at a Distrubed concert went viral, as he railed against the Hamas terror group. 'I miss people who were slaughtered like animals at the Nova Festival. Rape is not resistance. Slaughtering innocents at a music festival that brings together people from all walks of life is not resistance,' he said. 'I genuinely feel empathy for the Palestinian people. There is not a single Jew on this planet that does not celebrate life. We celebrate life. Hamas celebrates death and they need to be eradicated; not the Palestinians, Hamas. We need to save Gaza from Hamas.' At the time, Draiman told the Jewish Chronicle that he 'lost friends at the Nova Festival. So many were slaughtered. Even after all of these months I can’t shake the state of shock.'

Trump blasts ‘vicious’ Hamas, says phase 2 of ceasefire is up to ...	President Donald Trump expresses 'disappointment' that many of the hostages returned by Hamas were dead, says Israel must decide whether and how to proceed with phase two of the Gaza ceasefire. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump condemned Hamas on Wednesday, lamenting the fact that many of the hostages returned from the Gaza Strip are already dead. Speaking with reporters during a cabinet meeting – the first of his second term – Trump expressed his ‘disappointment’ that many of the hostages returned by Hamas were handed over to Israel dead. 'I'm very disappointed when I see four bodies came in today. These were young people - young people don't die. They [Hamas] think they're doing us a favor by sending us bodies,' Trump said. 'We got a lot of hostages back but it's very sad what happened to those people. We had a young lady with her hand practically blown off,' Trump said, referencing ex-hostage Emily Damari, who was wounded on October 7th. 'Do you know why it blew off? Because she put up her hand to try to stop a bullet that was coming her way.' The comments came shortly after Hamas transferred the remains of four slain Israeli hostages to the International Red Cross for return to Israel. The latest hostage return, which took place without the Gaza victory ceremonies seen previously, came after Israel suspended the release of Arab terrorists, in protest of the use of hostages in propaganda events. Trump condemned Hamas as a 'vicious group of people,' and appeared to leave the future of the Gaza ceasefire to Israel’s discretion. 'Israel is going to have to decide what they're doing. Phase one is going to be ending. Think of it, today they sent in four bodies - bodies!' The president echoed previous comments he made comparing the appearance of returning living captives to Holocaust survivors. 'When I saw the ones who came in two weeks ago, they looked like they just got out of a concentration camp. Then the following week a group came in and they weren't in as bad a shape.' 'I’ve spoken to a lot of parents and people involved. They want those bodies almost as much, if not more, than they want their son or daughter. It’s incredible the level of importance they place on bringing back the bodies.' Trump's comments come just days before the March 2nd deadline marking the end of the first phase of the hostage deal and Gaza ceasefire. Negotiations for implementing phase two are underway in Doha, Qatar, though the two sides are far from reaching a comprehensive agreement.

Israel working to ID slain captives’ bodies, terrorists released	Israel releasing terrorists in waves, as forensic testing continues to confirm identities of four slain hostages. By World Israel News Staff Israel is currently working to confirm the identities of four slain hostages' bodies returned by Hamas late Wednesday evening, as hundreds of Palestinian prisoners are being released from Israeli detention. Unlike previous exchange, which saw Hamas hold a ghoulish ceremony featuring the public display of murdered captives' coffins in front of cheering crowds of Gazans, the terror group quietly transferred the remains of what it says are four Israelis kidnapped on October 7th to the Red Cross in Gaza. Previously, Israel had waited until all captives were back on Israeli soil before releasing prisoners, but began freeing terrorists within minutes of the bodies being received by the Red Cross. However, Israel is releasing the terrorists in waves of some 100 every few hours, and will presumably halt the process if the bodies are not positively identified. The release of the four slain captives' bodies triggered Israel to advance the release of some 600 terrorists, who were originally slated to be released last Saturday. Israel indefinitely postponed their release after Hamas held a public ceremony, which including forcing one of the kidnapped Israelis to kiss a terrorist on the forehead. The body of a Gazan woman, whom Hamas claimed it accidentally sent to Israel in place of Shiri Bibas last Thursday, was returned to the Strip. According to Hebrew-language media reports, 37 Palestinian prisoners were released to Ramallah in the early hours of Thursday morning. Videos circulating on social media showed raucous celebrations in the streets of the Palestinian Authority-administered city, as the freed prisoners were greeted with a hero's welcome. Five Palestinians convicted on terror charges were freed to eastern Jerusalem, including Hamza al-Kaluti A Hamas member sentenced to life for planning deadly suicide bombings, he served 24 years in prison before being freed to his home in eastern Jerusalem's Beit Hanina neighborhood. Some 97 prisoners were deported to Egypt.

Smotrich: Biden holding up arms caused serious problems for IDF	Smotrich: 'We had to use mechanical kits from the Yom Kippur War, some of which failed to detonate.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News At a financial conference on Wednesday, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich discussed the issues caused by the Biden Administration's delay in providing arms to Israel. Smotrich stated, 'Due to the American embargo, which prevented us from receiving bomb kits, we had to use mechanical kits from the Yom Kippur War, some of which failed to detonate.' He added, 'Now, Hamas is utilizing them. However, the real danger of this deal is the message it sends: that anyone who wants to defeat the State of Israel and bring it to its knees only needs to kidnap Jews.' US President Joe Biden has faced pressure from within the Democratic Party to impose an arms embargo on Israel. Democratic lawmakers penned a letter in December 2024 stating that, despite the administration’s statement in November declaring Israel to be in compliance with the law, they believe the IDF 'failed to meet' the standards set by American regulations. 'We believe continuing to transfer offensive weapons to the Israeli government prolongs the suffering of the Palestinian people and risks our own national security by sending a message to the world that the US will apply its laws, policies, and international law selectively,' the letter said. Smotrich also criticized the current hostage deal, which is approaching its second phase. 'While we are excited about the return of each and every hostage, this deal is detrimental. It involves the release of hundreds of murderous terrorists who, according to all statistics, are determined to return to killing Jews.' 'It also leads to the rehabilitation of the Hamas leadership, both in Israel and abroad, and the exit from the Netzarim Corridor,' Smotrich added. 'In phase two, there is a red line that has not yet been crossed and must not be crossed&#8230; a declaration of the end of the war,' Smotrich warned, saying that such a declaration could lead to the establishment of a Palestinian State and the expulsion of Jews from Judea and Samaria.

Just 33% of Democrats have a favorable view of Israel, Gallup pol...	The poll demonstrates that, in the span of three years, Democratic favorability ratings for Israel have plummeted 30 points. By Ben Sales, JTA Just a third of Democrats have a favorable view of Israel, a steep decline from just a few years ago, according to a Gallup poll. That’s in contrast to 83% of Republicans who view Israel favorably — a partisan gap of 50 points. Responding to the results, Jewish Democratic leaders said they remained confident in their party’s pro-Israel bona fides — though one sounded notes of caution. Jewish Republicans celebrated the poll. The poll, published on Monday, is the latest stark sign that Democrats are losing their love for Israel. Previous polls taken during the Israel-Hamas war have shown that Democrats are more likely than Republicans to blame Israel for the fighting and to be more sympathetic to the Palestinians than to the Israelis. And the gap in this week’s poll shows that, after decades during which Israel was seen as a bipartisan issue, there is now a chasm between how voters from both parties view the country. The poll’s analysis attributed the gap to the Israel-Hamas war as well as polarization over President Donald Trump. 'The 50 points separating Republican and Democratic positivity toward Israel shatters the prior record of 30 points measured last year,' the Gallup page says. 'The widening partisan gap likely reflects Democrats’ opposition to Israel’s actions in the Israel-Hamas war. It could also be a reaction to Trump’s strong backing of Israel, highlighted in his meeting with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House earlier this month.' The poll demonstrates that, in the span of three years, Democratic favorability ratings for Israel have plummeted 30 points. In 2022, 63% of Democrats viewed Israel favorably The number dropped to 56% in 2023 and 47% in 2024 — following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack and the ensuing war in Gaza — before falling to 33% this year. The percentage of independents who view Israel favorably has also plunged in that time, from 71% in 2022 to 48% this year. The Republican numbers have remained about level during that time, going from 81% to 83%. Sixty percent of Democrats have an unfavorable view of Israel, the first time most of a partisan group has felt that way. Among independents, the unfavorable figure was 44%. Gallup did not share unfavorable numbers for Republicans. 'There’s no question Israel’s image has suffered among both Democrats and independents over the course of the war, and that’s a fact and its a problem,' said Mark Mellman, president of the Democratic Majority for Israel advocacy group. 'Theres a fight going on in the Democratic Party. It’s a hard fight.' Asked what she makes of the declining numbers, Halie Soifer, CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, attributed the drop to negative opinions of Netanyahu, who has embraced Trump’s proposals. 'Prime Minister Netanyahu’s close alignment with Donald Trump has clouded the way some see Israel,' she said in a statement. 'While Netanyahu is undoubtedly a polarizing figure, Jewish Democrats know that the U.S.-Israel relationship transcends any individual leader.' But both Soifer and Mellman pointed to reasons they were optimistic, mentioning the large majority of Democratic officials who are pro-Israel. Soifer also noted the Jewish vote in last year’s presidential election, which went solidly for Vice President Kamala Harris. She accused Trump of 'using and manipulating the [U.S.-Israel] relationship to further his own agenda.' 'Democratic leaders have never wavered in their support of Israel — including their initiation and support of historic levels of military aid to Israel during the Biden administration,' she said. 'The vast majority of Jewish Americans are both Democrats and pro-Israel, and proudly support a U.S.-Israel relationship that transcends any individual leader, whether they be in the U.S. or Israel.' Mellman, who is also a pollster, cited a poll his firm conducted ahead of the Democratic convention last year, in which 62% of Democrats said the United States should support Israel, versus just 7% who opted for Hamas — numbers close to the national average. 'Jews still consider the Democratic party to be a pro-Israel party, and they’re right — we had a pro-Israel platform, we had a pro-Israel Democratic president until this year,' he said. 'There’s no question that the Democratic Party remains pro-Israel.' The Republican Jewish Coalition begged to differ — pointing to an increasing Jewish Republican vote share, if still a minority, in the 2024 election. 'President Donald J. Trump received a historic share of the Jewish vote in 2024, as Democrats continue to hemorrhage support from the American Jewish community,' the group tweeted above a graph of the poll. 'The numbers don’t lie: there is only ONE pro-Israel party, and it is the GOP.'

Terror group leader who trained Columbia students on ‘Palestinian...	She also praised Iran—Hezbollah’s backer—as 'a nation on the side of the Palestinian people, intervening and building a movement of resistance to free this entire region … from U.S. imperialism.' By Jessica Costescu, The Washington Free Beacon Among a crowd mourning Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah's death and chanting 'Death to Israel, death to America' in Beirut on Sunday was Charlotte Kates, a leader of the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, which the United States sanctioned for providing financial support to terrorists. Just last spring, she was instructing Columbia University students on 'Palestinian resistance' tactics. Tens of thousands of black-clad mourners flooded the funeral at Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium, Lebanon’s largest sports arena. They vowed support for Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed terrorist group that began attacking Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with its ally, Hamas, following the latter’s Oct. 7 massacre of Israeli civilians. Israel, in response to Hezbollah’s assaults, invaded Lebanon and killed Nasrallah on Sept. 27, 2024. 'It is such an honor to be here in Beirut today, one among a sea of over a million people in collective tribute, mourning, love and commitment to the road of resistance and liberation exemplified by Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Sayyed Hisham Safieddine,' Kates posted to X on Sunday with photos of the crowd. Samidoun leader Charlotte Kates (Workers World Party/YouTube) 'The masses are truly out in the streets, affirming the indelible living legacy of the great anti-imperialist leader of our day, the great Arab and international revolutionary, the beloved speaker of truth and warrior of justice,' Kates, Samidoun’s international coordinator, added. In October, the United States sanctioned Samidoun and Kates’s husband, Khaled Barakat, for providing support to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a terrorist organization that participated in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack. Less than a year before Nasrallah’s funeral, Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD)—the Ivy League school’s most notorious anti-Semitic student group—invited Kates and Barakat, a PFLP member, to deliver speeches on 'the fight for liberation,' as part of a lecture titled 'Palestinian Resistance 101.' Shortly after the event, which the Washington Free Beacon attended virtually, Columbia student radicals launched the anti-Israel encampment and eventually stormed a campus building. In November, a month after the sanctions were issued, CUAD passed out pamphlets just outside Columbia's Morningside Heights gates encouraging attendees to 'get involved' with Samidoun. They included a QR code that sent users to Samidoun's website, which touts an 'Amsterdam free from Zionism' and calls to 'globalize the intifada!' 'The fact is that October 7 changed the world … we saw the potential of a future for Palestine liberated from Zionism,' Kates told a group of keffiyeh-clad Columbia students during her March 24 speech. She also praised Iran—Hezbollah’s backer—as 'a nation on the side of the Palestinian people, intervening and building a movement of resistance to free this entire region … from U.S. imperialism.' She advocated for a campaign to eliminate America's list of designated terror organizations. 'It is important to popularize campaigns to … scrap the U.S. terror list entirely, or at the very least to get Palestinian, Lebanese, Yemeni, Filipino, and other revolutionary organizations off the terror list,' Kates said. 'Because that's a weapon that's being used against the Palestinian people, against the Arab people, and against the solidarity movement as a whole, and in order to kind of fundamentally deform the politics of the movement.' In August, Kates traveled to Tehran where Iran awarded her the 'Eighth Annual Islamic Human Rights and Human Dignity Award.' Other recipients included Hamas head Ismail Haniyeh and Ziyad al-Nakhalah, the secretary general of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a U.S.-designated terror group. Barakat, meanwhile, explicitly endorsed terrorism against Jews during his own lecture for CUAD and lauded airplane hijackings as 'one of the most important tactics that the Palestinian resistance have engaged in.' Barakat is not the only person to have glorified plane hijackings at Columbia. In October, Joseph Slaughter, a member of Columbia’s top disciplinary body and an English professor who defended the illegal encampment at the Ivy League school, delivered a lecture that lauded a string of terrorist plane hijackings as 'spectacular' and 'remarkable,' the Free Beacon reported. CUAD has continued to terrorize campus. Last month, for example, anti-Israel radicals dumped cement into a campus building’s sewage system. A week earlier, pro-Hamas agitators stormed an Israeli history class and targeted Jewish students with anti-Semitic flyers.

Iran rejects nuclear talks with US as Trump admin ramps up ‘maxim...	Iran’s so-called 'supreme leader,' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the idea of negotiating with Washington, calling such a move 'unwise' and 'dishonorable.' By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Tuesday rejected the possibility of nuclear talks with the United States, which imposed new sanctions on Iran’s oil industry as part of the Trump administration’s so-called 'maximum pressure' campaign against Tehran. 'There will be no possibility of direct talks between us and the United States on the nuclear issue as long as the maximum pressure is applied in this way,' Araghchi said during a joint press conference with his visiting Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. 'We will not negotiate under pressure, threat, or sanctions,' he added. The top Iranian official’s remarks came a day after the US Treasury Department announced new sanctions on Iran’s oil industry, targeting over 30 brokers, tanker operators, and shipping companies involved in transporting and selling Iranian petroleum. The new oil sanctions were the latest to be imposed since US President Donald Trump reinstated his 'maximum pressure' policy toward Tehran, aiming to cut the country’s crude exports to zero and prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Earlier this month, however, Trump also expressed a willingness to talk to Iran’s leaders, stating his desire to reach a 'nuclear peace agreement' to improve bilateral relations with Tehran while insisting that the Iranian regime must not develop a nuclear weapon. Iran’s so-called 'supreme leader,' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the idea of negotiating with Washington, calling such a move 'unwise' and 'dishonorable.' Tuesday’s high-level meeting between Russian and Iranian officials took place in Tehran to discuss bilateral relations, regional developments, and the 2015 nuclear deal with major world powers that placed temporary restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. 'On the nuclear issue, we will move forward with the cooperation and coordination of our friends in Russia and China,' Araghchi said during the press conference. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the views of both Russian and Iranian officials were in alignment regarding Iran’s nuclear program. 'Positions were aligned on the situation around the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action [the official name for the 2015 nuclear deal] on the Iranian nuclear program,' it said. Iran has claimed that its nuclear program is for civilian purposes rather than building weapons. However, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), reported last year that Iran had greatly accelerated uranium enrichment to up to 60 percent purity, close to the roughly 90 percent weapons-grade level. At the time, the UK, France, and Germany said in a statement that there is no 'credible civilian justification' for Tehran’s recent nuclear activity, arguing it 'gives Iran the capability to rapidly produce sufficient fissile material for multiple nuclear weapons.' As Russia also faces increasing sanctions from the West over its war in Ukraine, Moscow and Tehran have deepened their cooperation. Ukraine and its allies have accused Iran of supplying weapons to Russia, allegations Tehran has denied. Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian signed a 20-year 'comprehensive strategic partnership treaty' reinforcing their economic and military cooperation. The bilateral cooperation between Tehran and Moscow comes at a time when Iran’s influence in the Middle East is waning, with the fall of long-time Iranian ally Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in Syria and Israel’s military successes against two of Iran’s terrorist proxies: Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. After the collapse of Assad’s regime, which was driven by an offensive led by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group, a former al-Qaeda affiliate, both Russia and Iran suffered a major setback in Syria despite years of investment in supporting their longtime ally during the civil war. 'Iran wants peace, stability, preservation of territorial integrity and unity, and the progress of Syria based on the will of the people,' Araghchi said on Tuesday, referring to Damascus’s new government. During the press conference, Lavrov also referred to Syria’s new regime, saying, 'We will do our utmost to ensure that the situation calms down and does not pose a threat either to the Syrian people … or to the people of neighboring states.'

International Red Cross, facing GOP criticism over Hamas propagan...	The ICRC sparked outrage when, roughly two weeks ago, officials Nour Khadam and Stephanie Eller joined uniformed Hamas terrorists on stage to participate in a propaganda ceremony surrounding the release of Israeli hostages. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon Just days after the Washington Free Beacon detailed mounting congressional concerns over the International Committee of the Red Cross's (ICRC) participation in a series of shocking Hamas hostage release ceremonies, an official from the aid agency approached the publication about advertising with the Free Beacon and sponsoring our daily newsletter, the Morning Beacon. 'Looking to see if I can get more info on newsletter sponsorship or online ads,' the ICRC's head of communications and public affairs, Steve Dorsey, wrote the Free Beacon on Monday. Five days earlier, the Free Beacon reported on Senate Republicans' outrage over the participation of ICRC officials in Hamas propaganda rituals and their desire to reassess U.S. funding to the organization. The ICRC's advertisement inquiry suggests it may be spooked by those talks and looking to shore up support on Capitol Hill. Dorsey told the Free Beacon that the ICRC has not 'traditionally done much advertising' and hoped to run spots that would link to its website and boost 'generic ICRC visibility.' A Free Beacon review of Meta's ad spending database found that the ICRC ran just five Facebook ads between 2019 and 2023. It did ramp up ad spending at the end of 2024 and beginning of 2025, running a series of Facebook and Instagram spots on the 'rules of war' that call for the protection of 'detainees,' 'families,' and 'civilians.' The committee failed to do that job when it did not follow through on its obligation to visit hostages in Hamas captivity or to lodge complaints if and when they were denied that right. None of those ads remain active, and all of them ran in Europe, according to the database. The United States is the ICRC's top patron, meaning the committee is tapping into a budget that includes U.S. taxpayer funds to advertise at a time when those funds are under threat. Dorsey did not answer questions on the committee's broader ad campaign and the motivations behind it. Instead, he encouraged 'Free Beacon readers to review' a Monday ICRC op-ed published in the Washington Examiner, which called the Hamas hostage transfers 'disturbing and dehumanizing' but did not address the group's failure to visit Israeli hostages in captivity. The ICRC sparked outrage when, roughly two weeks ago, officials Nour Khadam and Stephanie Eller joined uniformed Hamas terrorists on stage to participate in a propaganda ceremony surrounding the release of Israeli hostages. The pair signed documents and shook hands with masked Hamas terrorists. Last week, the ICRC again dispatched a staffer to sign documents alongside a Hamas terrorist on a stage that included an anti-Semitic sign depicting Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a bloodthirsty vampire. The sign also accused Netanyahu of killing the Bibas children, Ariel and Kfir, in an airstrike. An Israeli forensic review found that Hamas terrorists murdered four-year-old Ariel and nine-month-old Kfir 'with their bare hands.' While the Red Cross agreed to participate in those hostage release ceremonies, it did not visit the hostages during their time in captivity to assess their health, as the group routinely does during traditional conflicts. 'We continue to request information on the hostages and for access to them. We also continue to insist that they be able to share a message with their families,' the organization says on its website. 'Years of experience speaking with parties to conflicts and non-state armed groups have proven that our bilateral approach and confidential dialogue to raise issues of concern is important to achieve results, rather than public denunciations.' The ICRC's website, which the committee intended to promote in its ads with the Free Beacon, nonetheless touts its status as a 'neutral, impartial, and independent' organization that takes 'action, not sides.' It also includes an 'Israel-Gaza Emergency Appeal' that includes a photo of Gazan rubble and no photos of the Israeli hostages. 'The ICRC continues to do everything within our power to support people affected by the conflict, including trying all possible means to get aid, including critical health care, into Gaza, and persistently advocating on behalf of hostages being held in Gaza,' the appeal states. The ICRC has released public statements on the hostage ceremonies that refer to 'Israel and the occupied territories' and do not mention Hamas by name. In one February 19 statement, the organization urged 'dignity and privacy ahead of next release operation.' The next day, Hamas terrorists carried caskets holding the bodies of the Bibas children through the streets of Gaza as Palestinian onlookers cheered and enjoyed upbeat music.

Deal reached for return of captives’ remains ‘without Hamas cerem...	Egypt, acting as a mediator, confirmed the breakthrough and said it will oversee the exchange, reportedly scheduled to take place at 11 p.m. local time on Wednesday. By Joshua Marks, JNS Israel’s Prime Minister’s Office confirmed that an agreement had been reached with Hamas on Wednesday to resolve the delay in Jerusalem’s release of some 600 Palestinian terrorists as part of the ceasefire deal. Following Israeli demands, 'a deal was reached with the mediators: our four fallen hostages will be returned tonight as part of Phase 1, under an agreed procedure and without Hamas ceremonies,' the PMO stated. Under the deal, the prisoners are set to be freed simultaneously with the transfer to Israel by Hamas of four Israeli hostages’ remains, completing Phase 1 of the ceasefire agreement, according to Channel 12 News. Egypt, acting as a mediator, confirmed the breakthrough and said it will oversee the exchange, reportedly scheduled to take place at 11 p.m. local time on Wednesday. Gaza’s Hamas-affiliated Quds News Network also reported that the transfer would occur under Egyptian supervision. Israeli officials were updating the families of the deceased hostages expected to be returned on Wednesday, Ynet reported. According to Hamas, it was preparing to return the bodies of slain Israeli captives Tsahi Idan, Ohad Yahalomi, Itzik Elgarat and Shlomo Mansour. The hostages’ remains were initially set to be released on Thursday in accordance with the terms of the ceasefire agreement with Jerusalem. The Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades, a terrorist group in the Gaza Strip affiliated with Hamas, previously announced on its official Telegram channel that it would release the body of Yahalomi on Thursday. Israel was set to free the prisoners on Feb. 22, including 50 serving life sentences, 60 serving long terms and 47 who were rearrested after being released as part of the 2011 swap for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Sunday that he had temporarily paused the Palestinian prisoners’ release 'in light of Hamas’s repeated violations [of the ceasefire], including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes.' U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes described Netanyahu’s decision as an 'appropriate response' to Hamas’s actions, according to Reuters. Hughes stressed that U.S. President Donald Trump was ready to back Jerusalem in 'whatever course of action it chooses regarding Hamas.' On Monday night, Channel 12 News reported that the bodies of two slain hostages would be transferred to Egyptian territory 'within 24 hours' in exchange for the release of 302 jailed Palestinian terrorists. According to the report, Hamas agreed to release the bodies of two more deceased Israeli captives later in exchange for the remaining prisoners. The return this week of the remains of four hostages would be the final exchange of Phase 1 of the ceasefire, which took effect on Jan. 19 and is due to end on March 1. According to Israel’s assessment, there are 63 hostages remaining in Gaza, including 60 men and 3 women. Thirty-six of the captives have been murdered, including 35 from Oct. 7 and Hadar Goldin, abducted in 2014. Israel to send delegation for next phase of hostage deal U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff announced on Tuesday that Israel will send a delegation to Doha or Cairo to advance Phase 2 of the hostage deal. Speaking at an American Jewish Committee meeting in Washington, he highlighted significant progress and efforts to secure the release of more hostages. Witkoff added that he may join the talks if they yield positive results. Israeli sources indicated to Israel Hayom that Hamas faces three possible paths: surrender, disarmament, and exile to bring the war to an end; prolonging the initial phase through further hostage exchanges for prisoners and increased humanitarian aid; or a return to full-scale combat. Discussions on the return of the remaining hostages are set to begin in Cairo in the coming days, but only after Israel recovers the bodies. Israel intends to send a delegation to these talks, building on the groundwork established over the past two weeks in the U.S. between Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and Witkoff. Despite the terms of the agreement, the Israel Defense Forces are not expected to withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor or the security perimeter in the near future—if at all.

7,000 terrorist attacks in Judea and Samaria in 2024	Israelis subjected to an average of 20 terror attacks per day in Judea and Samaria last year, with hundreds of bombings, nearly 180 shootings, hundreds of fire bombings, and dozens of stabbing and ramming attacks. By World Israel News Staff Palestinian Arab terrorists carried out or attempted close to 7,000 attacks on Israelis in Judea and Samaria last year, according to a report by the emergency aid group SSF Rescuers Without Borders – Judea and Samaria. According to the report, released on Tuesday, during 2024, there were an average of roughly 20 attacks or attempted attacks per day in Judea and Samaria alone, not including attacks in or from the Gaza Strip, Lebanon, or inside the State of Israel proper. The attacks left a total of 27 people dead and 306 injured, the SSF Rescuers Without Borders report said. More than half of the attacks were rock-throwing incidents, with 3,668 such attacks being reported out on roads across Judea and Samaria last year. Fire bombings and Molotov cocktail attacks were also common, with 843 such attacks reported in 2024, for an average of 2.3 every day. There were 671 reported instances of Palestinian Arabs using laser devices to blind Israeli drivers in attempts to cause them to become disoriented and crash. A total of 526 conventional bombing attacks were reported – excluding firebombs, incendiary devices, or attacks using gas tanks. Israelis reported 179 shooting attacks across Judea and Samaria last year, along with 364 arson attacks or bombings using gas tanks. In three dozen cases, bottles or bags of paint were thrown at Israeli vehicles, in order to obscure their windshields and cause the driver to crash. There were 37 stabbing attacks – 9 of which were successful – and 19 vehicular ramming attacks, 12 of which were successful. In addition, Arab terrorists violently assaulted Israelis in 15 different incidents involving carjackings.

‘A miracle’ – Divine providence behind failure of Tel Aviv bus bo...	A journalist and strategic analyst from the United Arab Emirates rips Palestinian Authority following botched bombing of Israeli buses, calls terrorists' mistake 'divine intervention.' By World Israel News Staff An Arab journalist took aim at the Palestinian Authority after a botched bomb attack in Tel Aviv destroyed three buses, following Israel's decision to permit Arab workers from Judea and Samaria into Israel. A cell of Palestinian Arab terrorists operating in the Tel Aviv area planted explosives on five empty buses overnight last Thursday in the city of Bat Yam. Due to a mistake in the timing programmed into the bombs' detonators, three of the bombs went off in the middle of the night, destroying the buses, while causing no casualties. Two of the five targeted buses were unscathed. It was later revealed that the terrorists had accidentally set the detonation time for PM. rather than AM, causing the bombs to explode while the buses were sitting in a depot overnight, instead of during morning rush hour. On Friday, a day after the bombings, Amjad Taha, a pro-Israel strategist and journalist from the United Arab Emirates, said the attack reflected poorly on the Palestinian Authority, noting that prior to the bombing, Israel had approved work permits for Palestinian Arabs for the Tel Aviv area. 'And to think, Israel agreed to the Palestinian Authority’s request to allow their workers into Tel Aviv. This is how some of them repaid that trust,' Taha tweeted. Taha, author of The Deception of the Arab Spring, also hailed the failure of the terrorists to properly set the detonators as a 'miracle' and 'divine intervention' protecting the intended targets. 'When God chooses to protect you, He bends time itself, turning AM into PM,' Taha continued. 'Was it divine intervention or sheer hatred blinding them? Palestinian Islamist terrorists from the West Bank set their bomb for PM instead of AM, an attack meant to slaughter Israeli women and children during the morning rush, only to detonate in an empty parking lot. A mistake or a miracle?'

Olmert reveals 2008 map conceding 94% of Judea & Samaria to PA	The former prime minister told the BBC that he had exclaimed, 'Sign it and let’s change history!' to Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas, who refused. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Sixteen years after presenting a secret map to Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas that conceded 94% of Judea and Samaria in exchange for a peace agreement, former prime minister Ehud Olmert has revealed it to the BBC. In an interview to be shown as part of the British broadcaster’s upcoming series called 'Israel and the Palestinians: The Road to 7th October,' Olmert said that he met with Abbas in Jerusalem on September 16, 2008, showed him the map and implored him to approve it immediately. 'Sign it! Sign it, and let’s change history!' he recalled saying. 'This is the first time that I expose this map to the media,' he noted to the director, Norma Percy. While according to Olmert, Abbas had responded by saying that this was a 'very serious' proposal, the Palestinian leader never got back to him about it. Rafiq al-Husseini, Abbas’ then-chief of staff, said in the documentary that the Palestinian delegation had laughed off the plan in the ride back to Ramallah, because they 'knew this wasn’t going anywhere,' since Olmert 'was a lame duck,' having already told the public that he was going to resign amidst a corruption investigation against him. The diagram envisioned Israel annexing only 4.9% of the heartland of the country that had been liberated in the 1967 Six Day War, encompassing only a few main settlement blocs. The Palestinians would receive equivalent areas in pre-1967 Israel to make up the difference by adding land abutting the borders of both Gaza and Judea and Samaria. Under Olmert's proposal a whopping 58,000 Jews would have been evacuated from all the other villages and towns in the territory. This was over seven times the number of Jewish residents of the Gaza Strip who were forced out of their homes in the 2005 Disengagement in a process that had torn the country apart, and whose resettlement had barely begun, even three years later. There was a tunnel or road marked off to connect the Gaza Strip to the main PA territory in Judea and Samaria, although the coastal enclave was already controlled by the Hamas terror organization. In total negation of Israel’s official and long-held position, Jerusalem was to be divided, with each party claiming parts of it as its capital. A 'trusteeship committee' consisting of Israel, the PA, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the U.S. were to oversee the administration of the 'holy basin' of the Old City and its religious sites. Olmert said he had told Abbas, 'For the next 50 years, you won’t find a single Israeli leader who will offer you what I’m offering now.' Although there has been for decades a Jewish 'peace camp' in Israel that was prepared to give up a large part of Judea and Samaria, either with or without parts of Jerusalem, in order to end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, since the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led terrorist invasion in which they slaughtered 1,200 and took 251 people hostage, this leftist voice has been silenced. In a January survey by Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), 64% of the Jews polled opposed the creation of a Palestinian state 'under any condition,' and a third supported Israeli annexation of the Gaza Strip. Another poll, taken right before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met U.S. President Donald Trump early this month, showed even greater opposition, with 71% opposing a Palestinian state in Judea and Samaria and almost 70% saying they want to extend Israeli sovereignty over this territory. Last July, the Israeli parliament overwhelmingly voted to reject Palestinian statehood in any form. 'The Israeli Knesset opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state on any piece of land west of the Jordan River,' the resolution reads. 'The existence of a Palestinian state in the heart of Israel will pose an existential threat to the State of Israel and its citizens, will further extend the Israel-Palestinian Arab conflict and be a source of destabilization for the entire region.'

‘Shaken to the core’: Wife of slain hostage mourns betrayal after...	Yocheved was also abducted from their home on the kibbutz. She and hostage Nurit Cooper were freed after 17 days of captivity. By Pesach Benson, TPS Speaking at the funeral of murdered hostage Oded Lifshitz, Israeli President asked forgiveness from the family and Kibbutz Nir Oz, and reiterated calls for a commission of inquiry on Tuesday. 'I stand here, facing the foothills of your land, and as the President of the State of Israel, on behalf of the State of Israel – I ask you – beloved Oded, respected and from your dear family – forgiveness. Forgiveness that the State of Israel did not protect you, your family and your kibbutz. Forgiveness that you are forced to stand alone in the face of human monsters. Forgiveness that we did not have time to save and return you and all your friends – from the jaws of the murderers, here, home, in peace. Forgiveness,' Herzog said. 'I humbly ask for this forgiveness from you too – the brave and noble friends and members of Kibbutz Nir Oz. As the President of the State of Israel, I ask in this painful and agonizing situation to bow my head to you too and ask forgiveness from all of you: Forgiveness that we were not here for you on that cursed day. Forgiveness for the omission and the eclipse of the lights that you paid, and we all paid, such a terrible price.' Lifshitz, 84, was a retired journalist, one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz in 1955, and a peace activist. He was known for volunteering for 'Road to Recovery,' a non-governmental organization that transports Palestinian children with medical conditions to Israeli hospitals for treatment. His wife, Yocheved was also abducted from their home on the kibbutz. She and hostage Nurit Cooper were freed after 17 days of captivity. 'Our abduction and your death shake me to the core. We fought for years for peace and social justice – unfortunately, we were dealt a harsh blow by the very people we helped on the other side,' Yocheved said. Herzog also renewed his call for a commission of inquiry to investigate the failures that led to Hamas’s attack on October 7. 'I once again call for the establishment of a state commission of inquiry, which is the royal road of a reformed state – to delve boldly and professionally into everything that caused the failure and the terrible disaster. This is a critical milestone in the journey towards healing, rehabilitation, and building the state and society – after the terrible disaster,' he said. On Sunday, the High Court of Justice gave the government a deadline of May 11 to update the court on its position on forming a formal state commission of inquiry. This was in response to a petition filed by the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, which sought the court to order the commission’s forming. There have been growing calls for the government to appoint an independent commission of inquiry to investigate political and military failures. Such commissions have broader authority to summon witnesses and collect evidence and are headed by a senior Supreme Court justice. They may include personal recommendations about individuals under investigation, though the government is not bound to act on the recommendations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other government ministers say a state inquiry into failings that led to Hamas’s October 7 attacks should only be held after the war. Critics accuse Netanyahu of delaying the inquiry and trying to water down the powers of a commission. The last state commission of inquiry, which investigated Israel’s worst civilian disaster — a stampede that killed 45 people at a holy site on Mount Meron — held Netanyahu personally responsible for the tragedy in a report released in April. The military presented its own inquiry to Defense Minister Israel Katz. That probe only dealt with operational and command issues and not political decisions. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 63 remaining hostages, 36 are believed to be dead.

British court rules against antisemitic Pink Floyd frontman in de...	The case could go to trial to determine damages, though barrister Simon Myerson predicted that Waters and Al Jazeera will settle with Ware. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon A British court determined in a preliminary ruling that Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters defamed John Ware, a veteran journalist who made a documentary critical of Waters's anti-Semitic history when he called Ware a 'lying, conniving Zionist mouthpiece' who supports the 'genocide of the Palestinian people.' The development puts both Waters and the Hamas-friendly network Al Jazeera on the hook for damages. In the Tuesday ruling, the British High Court of Justice found that Waters's 'statements are defamatory' because they were offered as fact, not opinion. The decision sets the stage for Ware to receive financial compensation not just from Waters but also from Al Jazeera, the Arab network funded in large part by the Hamas-friendly nation of Qatar. Waters's comments targeting Ware came during a 2024 interview on the Al Jazeera network, which Ware sued in addition to Waters. The case could go to trial to determine damages, though barrister Simon Myerson predicted that Waters and Al Jazeera will settle with Ware. Ware, a documentarian who produced a 2023 film examining Waters’s vast anti-Israel advocacy, sued the musician and Al Jazeera last year. Waters appeared on Al Jazeera to bash Ware’s film and accused the journalist of 'cheerleading the genocide of the Palestinian people like almost more than anyone else on earth.' Ware’s documentary, The Dark Side of Roger Waters, was produced for the Campaign Against Antisemitism, a British nonprofit that combats Jew hatred. In it, Ware examined the singer’s long history of anti-Israel activism and embrace of anti-Semitic imagery. Waters, for instance, dressed in Nazi regalia during a 2023 show and displayed an inflatable pig emblazoned with Jewish stars. Ware’s documentary detailed the musician’s plans to add other slogans and symbols to the pig, including 'dirty kike,' 'follow the money,' and 'scum.' His Nazi cosplay earned a rare rebuke from the Biden administration State Department, which described Waters as having a 'long track record of using antisemitic tropes to denigrate Jewish people.' In the wake of Oct. 7, Waters said Hamas's terror attack was justified and accused Israel of 'making up stories' about widespread rape and torture on that day. 'Was it justified for [Hamas] to resist the occupation? Yeah,' Waters said just a month after the attack. 'They are absolutely legally and morally bound to resist the occupation since 1967.' Referring to reports that Hamas raped women, killed babies, and tortured civilians during its rampage through Israel, Waters downplayed the revelations. 'We don't yet know what happened,' he said at the time. 'Maybe there were some individual cases of civilians getting killed.' Waters is also a leading supporter of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, an anti-Semitic global campaign to wage economic warfare on the Jewish state.

The mother of freed hostage Liri Albag on what her daughter endur...	Liri learned Arabic, studied her captors’ psychology, and knew when to speak and when to stay silent. She did not resist, did not rebel—she survived. By Hugh Fitzgerald, Frontpage Magazine Shiri Albag is the mother of the recently-freed hostage Liri Albag. Her daughter suffered in captivity, but says that the 'men had it [even] worse.' More on her long captivity, and her slow recuperation at home, and above all, her observations on those 'innocent Gazan civilians,' can be found here: '‘The girls suffered, but men suffer more’: Shira Albag speaks about Liri’s time in captivity,' by Liam Dev and Maya Cohen, Jerusalem Post, February 13, 2025: After 477 days of uncertainty, endless prayers, and relentless struggle, Shira Albag wakes up from a dream—only this time, it is not a nightmare. She is finally waking up next to her daughter, Liri. 'You know, waking up with your daughter after so long, feeling her presence—it’s overwhelming,' she says. 'I keep telling myself, I’m in a dream.' Liri Albag, the IDF lookout soldier kidnapped from the Nahal Oz outpost on October 7, has not returned to the life she once knew. She is no longer the same girl who enlisted a year and a half ago. Despite the smiles and reunions with friends, something in her has changed. 'Yes and no,' Shira says when asked if her daughter is starting to return to herself. 'The moment I saw Liri and she shouted at us, ‘Liri Number 1’—our private joke at home—I thought, that’s my daughter. I was afraid of what I would get back, but it’s her. It’s my Liri.' Yet for every joyful moment, there are silent ones—the realization that the road ahead is long. 'She’s grown up a lot,' Shira says, her voice heavy. 'She understands so much, but she’s also very quiet at times. On one hand, she talks a lot, but on the other, it’s like everything is mixed together.' It turns out Liri did not just survive—she found a way to navigate through hell. 'The moment she was taken, she realized her reality. She was now a hostage in Gaza, and she would learn to survive.' Survival was not a choice; it was instinct. '‘I’ll play their game, but I’ll outsmart them,’ she told me,' Shira recalls. Liri learned Arabic, studied her captors’ psychology, and knew when to speak and when to stay silent. She did not resist, did not rebel—she survived…. And Liri Albag not only survived, but helped other Israelis to survive. Another hostage released earlier, Amit Soussana, described how Liri had saved her life, by convincing Soussana’s captors that she was not a soldier. Soldiers who were being held hostage received the cruelest treatment from Hamas; some — we don’t know how many — were executed. When Shira remembers the day her daughter was taken, anger fills her voice. 'There’s so much anger about October 7,' she admits. 'Not toward the soldiers who fought bravely, but toward the fact that no one was there who knew what to do. They sat there for hours—nearly four hours—watching their friends… some were still alive. If someone had come, they could have been saved.' There was a terrible failure of Israeli intelligence leading up to the October 7 attacks. Signals that had been picked up by Israeli intelligence, about a possible large-scale cross-border operation by Hamas, were unaccountably ignored by the leaders of the IDF. In fact, two IDF commando companies were diverted to Judea and Samaria from the Gaza border just days before the onslaught. There were IDF lookouts, like 19-year-old Liri Albag, but only a handful of soldiers to guard the kibbutzim, and only private security guards to protect the party-goers at the Nova music festival. They waited at the kibbutzim as 6,000 Hamas members, accompanied by hundreds of Gazan civilians eager to watch or even join in the fun, including the looting of Israeli homes, poured into Israel from Gaza for the IDF. But it took four hours before the IDF finally arrived, many hours too late. 1,200 Israelis had been subject to torture, rape, mutilation, before being murdered, and 251 Israelis had been taken back to Gaza as hostages where, like Liri Albag, they were subject to every sort of physical and mental torment. It wasn’t just Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad who held Israelis captive. It was also those people we call 'innocent civilians' who held some of the hostages captive in their homes. 'The so-called uninvolved civilians' — including even their 'little children' — took part in holding Israelis captive. The most important message, repeated three times in this brief interview with Liri Albag’s mother, is that not just Hamas combatants, but all the people in Gaza, including children, are implicated in the holding of hostages. Some civilians kept the hostages, as domestic or sex slaves, in their homes. In Shira Albag’s estimation, there are no 'innocent' Gazans; they all supported Hamas’ attack, and were delighted to learn of the atrocities inflicted by 6,000 Hamas operatives on October 7. These 'innocent civilians' ran beside the motorcycles and flatbed trucks on which Israelis were carried back into Gaza, beating the terrified and often wounded men, women, and children. In every encounter with the hostages inside Gaza during the sixteen months of war, those 'innocent civilians' exhibited the same cruelty as Hamas members. That is why Shiri Albag says that 'unfortunately, there are two million terrorists in Gaza. Two million. Liri was in their homes, and the children — yes, even the children — are part of this. It’s not just those carrying rifles and wearing green headbands. The so-called uninvolved civilians are not uninvolved at all. And, unfortunately, we’re going to have to fight them all.'

Cruz: ‘Israel’s right to Judea and Samaria starts in the Bible’	He expressed sympathy for the 'unfathomable trauma' Israel and the Jewish people endure as 'Palestinian savages make the return of every hostage, living or murdered, an ongoing nightmare.' By JNS Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Tuesday expressed his long-held support for Israel and what he said was its biblically rooted right to its historic homeland in Judea and Samaria Addressing the Sovereignty Conference 2025 in Jerusalem on Tuesday via video, Cruz reiterated his long-held position that Israel has an 'absolute right to determine what happens in Judea and Samaria.' That right 'starts in the Bible and extends through modern times,' he added. Thanking Yesha Council chairman Israel Gantz for his work to strengthen the U.S.-Israel alliance, Cruz said, 'As you meet today, have confidence that the American people stand with you. And under President Trump and our new Republican Congress, the American government stands with you as well.' The Yesha Council is an umbrella group of local and regional councils in Judea and Samaria. 'As for your enemies, who are also the enemies of America, we know that they seek to weaken you and to weaken us. And then to destroy you. And then to destroy us,' continued Cruz. He expressed sympathy for the 'unfathomable trauma' Israel and the Jewish people endure as 'Palestinian savages make the return of every hostage, living or murdered, an ongoing nightmare.' Cruz quoted remarks by Menachem Begin, part of a famous exchange the former Israeli prime minister had with then-Senator Joe Biden in June 1982. Biden reportedly banged on the table with his fist, to which Begin replied, 'This desk is designed for writing, not for fists. Don’t threaten us with slashing aid.' Quoting Begin, Cruz said: 'Don’t threaten us with cutting off your aid. It will not work. I am not a Jew with trembling knees. I am a proud Jew with 3,700 years of civilized history. Nobody came to our aid when we were dying in the gas chambers and ovens. Nobody came to our aid when we were striving to create our country. 'We paid for it. We fought for it. We died for it. We will stand by our principles. We will defend them. And when necessary, we will die for them again. With or without your aid.' The Texas senator concluded: 'Every person in this room has paid for the Land of Israel, has fought for the Land of Israel, and far too many have died for the Land of Israel. I am proud to stand with you unshakably as you determine the future of Judea and Samaria.'

Trump to sell US citizenship with $5 million ‘gold cards’	President Donald Trump announces plans to sell green cards to wealthy foreigners - dubbing them 'gold cards' - allowing holders to live and work in the US, with a pathway to citizenship. By World Israel News Staff The Trump administration is drafting plans to sell residency and work permits to wealthy foreigners, along with a pathway to citizenship, President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday. Speaking with reporters in the Oval Office, the president unveiled a plan to sell visas - dubbed 'gold cards,' to non-citizens who can cough up the proposed $5 million fee. The new gold cards, which mirror green cards, will grant non-citizens residency and work rights on American territory, with an option to gain American citizenship. Currently, green cards are offered to non-citizens on the basis of family ties, pre-existing employment in the U.S., or through investment, via the EB-5 visa. The gold card system is expected to go into effect in two weeks, replacing the EB-5 investors green card visa. First launched in 1992, the EB-5 visas require a non-citizen to invest between $800,000 to $1.05 million in the U.S. 'We’re going to be selling a gold card,' Trump said. 'You have a green card. This is a gold card. We’re going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million and that’s going to give you green card privileges, plus it’s going to be a route to citizenship.' 'And wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card.' Trump touted the plan as a way to generate revenue without taxing American citizens, while also attracting high-income individuals to relocate to the U.S. When asked whether Russian oligarchs could take advantage of the opportunity, the president responded: 'Yeah, possibly. I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people.' Standing alongside Trump in the Oval Office, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said applications for the gold card program would undergo a careful screening process. 'They’ll have to go through vetting, of course,' Lutnick said, 'to make sure they’re wonderful world-class global citizens.'

Tens of thousands mourn Bibas family as mother, children laid to ...	Crowds hold orange balloons, Israeli flags, and signs saying 'Sorry', sing Hatikva, as the funeral procession left its starting point in Rishon Lezion. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Tens of thousands of Israelis lined the route being taken Wednesday morning to bring to rest the Bibas family members murdered by Hamas, with the funeral procession making its way from central Israel to the cemetery near their Gaza-border home, Kibbutz Nir Oz. The family, who had stated earlier in the week that the funeral itself would be private, had published the approximate times the coffin-laden cars carrying Shiri Bibas and her two sons, Kfir (9 months) and Ariel (4) would pass various intersections in the country. The procession began around 8 AM at the religious burial society of Rishon Lezion, and thousands stood in the cold to honor the family. They held orange balloons, referring to the color of the young children’s hair, orange and Israeli flags, and many signs, among them those saying 'Sorry.' The apology was for the inability to save the three, whose picture, of an obviously terrified Shiri clutching her babies as terrorists surrounded her, became one of the most famous depictions of Hamas’ brutality on October 7, 2023, when the terrorists took 251 people hostage in all, and slaughtered 1,200 during their surprise invasion of Israel. Some of the onlookers burst into tears as the vehicles bearing the bodies passed by, while others sang Hatikva, Israel’s national anthem. In a statement to the masses of people paying their respects, the Bibas family said, 'We see and hear you; we are moved and strengthened by you.' 'Yarden apologizes for not being able to come and hug each and every one of you,' it continued. 'We hope for the day when we can once again be together in moments of joy and not sadness.' Yarden Bibas, Shiri’s husband and the children’s father, had been abducted separately and never saw his family in captivity. After the terrorists murdered them about a month into the war, they cruelly told him that an IDF airstrike had killed them, but provided no proof of their deaths, psychologically torturing him in addition to subjecting him to starvation and other harsh physical conditions until he was released on February 1. When the bodies were returned last week, at first Hamas tried to pass off a Palestinian body as Shiri’s but their subterfuge was immediately discovered and they bowed to the pressure to return her two days later. Forensic investigators proved that the terrorists had strangled Kfir and Ariel, but tried to make it look like they had died from an Israeli jet’s missile by crushing their skulls afterwards. These were horrific details that became public knowledge after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described this abuse of the victims in two different forums this week as proof of Hamas’ evil. IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari had said after the bodies were identified Friday that the children had been murdered 'in cold blood' and with 'bare hands,' and that their captors had then 'committed horrific acts' to cover up their crime. According to Ofri Bibas, Yarden’s sister, the family had wanted the details mentioned by Netanyahu kept private, saying in response to the extra revelations, 'If I could say one thing to everyone on behalf of the Bibas family: Just shut up.' 'As someone who sat in the room with Hagari that day, I’ll write this: Yarden and the family approved, word for word, what the IDF spokesman said in the statement. Nothing more,' she said. According to journalist Yossi Melman, however, Yarden had approved the dissemination of this added information. The funeral ceremony and eulogies will be broadcast live in Hostages Square in Tel Aviv and online beginning at 11:30.

‘Up to Netanyahu’ how to handle Hamas, says Trump	It is not my decision, it is Netanyahu's decision,' says Trump as fragile Gaza ceasefire faces possible collapse. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump has given Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a free hand in dealing with the Hamas terror organization, amid fears the fragile ceasefire in the Gaza Strip may be on the brink of collapse. The president spoke with reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday regarding the hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, and the president's ultimatum to Hamas earlier this month demanding that all Israeli hostages be released in a single transfer. 'As you know, they [Hamas] weren't going to release any more hostages, and I said there is going to be hell to pay, and then they agreed that they were going to release the hostages that they had agreed to release, plus an extra one,' Trump said of the near collapse of the hostage deal two weeks ago. Following Hamas' threat not to comply with the agreement and to delay the release of Israeli hostages, Trump said that it is up to Israel to decide whether to resume its war against Hamas. 'And so you could say that was a big difference. But I said that from that point, it's up to Bibi Netanyahu and Israel.' 'I may have taken a different stance,' Trump hinted. 'But they did go back to releasing the hostages. But if you remember, they said they weren't going to release any. They totally ended it.' 'And then I said, 'Well, if they're not going to release any, there's going to be hell to pay'.' 'But the rest is really up to him. I may have done it differently than him. It's not my decision, it's his decision. But they did release all of those hostages.' Following Trump's ultimatum and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's threat to resume the war in Gaza if hostages were not returned as planned on February 15th, Hamas agreed to release Israeli captives in keeping with the hostage deal. Since then, however, the future of the ceasefire, and the prospects for the implementation of the second phase of the deal appear increasingly uncertain, after Hamas misidentified one of the bodies returned to Israel last week, delaying the return of the remains of Shiri Bibas. Israel castigated the terror group for parading Israeli hostages - both living and dead - before their return to Israel, including one instance in which a captive was forced to kiss his captor goodbye. In response to the use of Israeli hostages in Hamas victory parades and ceremonies, Israel has frozen the freeing of 602 jailed Arab terrorists until Jerusalem receives assurances that no more Israeli captives will be used for public displays by Hamas.

Trump pressured Netanyahu to vote with Russia, against Ukraine in...	US reportedly 'insisted' Israel vote against resolution in the United Nations General Assembly affirming Ukraine's territorial integrity, joining Russia and North Korea in opposing the measure. By World Israel News Staff Israel voted this week against a United Nations resolution backing Ukraine's territorial integrity, amid pressure from the United States to actively oppose the measure, an Israeli official claimed. The vote, which was held in the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, marks the first time since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022 that Israel's mission to the UN has voted against Ukraine and backed the Russian position. Monday's resolution is symbolic, condemning Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine and demanding Russia withdraw all of its forces from Ukrainian territory, including Russian-majority provinces in eastern Ukraine annexed to Russia. The resolution passed by a wide majority of 93 to 18, with 65 abstentions. The United States joined Russia in opposing the resolution, along with North Korea, Belarus, Hungary, and Israel. Iran, China, and the United Arab Emirates all abstained. Speaking with the Jewish Insider in a report published Tuesday, an unnamed Israeli official emphasized that while Israel supports Ukraine's position, Jerusalem was subjected to intense pressure from Washington to vote against Monday's measure. 'There was a lot of pressure from the U.S., they really insisted,' the official said. 'It came at all levels, at the U.N., in Washington and in Israel.' The official emphasized that the vote 'is not our position.' It 'wasn’t easy for us … We preferred to avoid this situation. We had no choice but to take a side.' While Israel 'could have abstained,' the official continued, 'because we asked for a lot from [the Trump administration] in recent weeks and days, the decision was to go all the way with them.' The UN resolution L.10, identical to another measure passed with 141 votes in February 2023, was introduced to the General Assembly by Ukraine's deputy foreign affairs minister. The American mission to the UN, which voted in favor of the Ukrainian draft two years ago, submitted a rival resolution which was rejected by the General Assembly. The U.S.-backed draft resolution, L.11, emphasized the need for a 'swift end to the conflict' and a 'lasting peace between Ukraine and the Russian Federation,' without demanding a Russian withdrawal or condemning Russia's invasion. Ukraine slammed Israel's decision to vote against the Ukrainian-backed draft resolution. 'The resolution was blaming Russia for the war and supporting Ukrainian territorial integrity. Israel could have abstained, and it voted against it … It would be like if Ukraine would vote against returning the hostages to Israel,' Ukrainian Ambassador to Israel Yevgen Kornichuk told the Jewish Insider. 'This is really harming our relations.' However, Ukraine has regularly voted against Israel in the UN General Assembly, while never voting with the Jewish state on Israel-related measures. According to the group UN Watch, over the past ten years, Ukraine has voted against Israel on 75% of all measures related to the Jewish state, and abstained 25% of the time. Last year, Ukraine voted in favor of such anti-Israel measures as a resolution negating Israel's right to self-defense against Palestinian terror and endorsing Arab sovereignty over Gaza, Judea, Samaria, and eastern Jerusalem. Another measure passed last year and backed by Ukraine condemned Israeli towns in Judea, Samaria, the Golan Heights and Israeli neighborhoods in eastern Jerusalem.

Arab-Israeli soccer team fires spokesman for pro-Hamas interview	Spokesman of popular Arab-Israeli soccer team claims that women kidnapped by Hamas 'were treated with respect according to Islamic law and were not harmed.' By World Israel News Staff An Arab-Israeli who serves as the spokesman for the Bnei Sakhnin soccer team supported Hamas in an interview with an Arabic-language TV channel affiliated with the terror group, sparking outrage throughout Israel's soccer world. Said Hassanin, who is also a journalist, recently gave an interview to the Hamas-controlled Al-Aqsa TV channel, which is banned from broadcasting in Israel. During the interview, Hassanin downplayed Hamas atrocities against Israelis, and claimed that Israeli hostages had been treated humanely by their captors. He added that all women who were kidnapped by Hamas 'were treated with respect according to Islamic law and were not harmed. This clearly demonstrates who is barbaric and who is humane, and who is acting in accordance with their religious and Islamic teachings.' Hassanin failed to acknowledge widespread reports of sexual assault and harassment from freed female captives. Railing against Israeli-Arabs who enlist in the IDF, Hassanin referred to them as 'weak-minded people who join the ranks of the enemy army.' He added that 'the time has come for anyone [Arab] who is&#8230;considering joining the army of occupation to think a million times about where they are going and how they are selling their conscience, morality and religion on this immoral path.' Hassanin's remarks were met with swift pushback, as the Bnei Sakhnin soccer club announced that he had been fired. However, the club said they had 'summoned' Hassanin for clarification, and claimed that his remarks had been 'taken out of context.' Sports and Culture Minister Miki Zohar had encouraged Hassanin's firing, saying his continued employment would be a 'spit in the face' to Israeli soccer. 'Bnei Sakhnin cannot allow such things from [their club], otherwise we will not be able to heal the rifts in Israeli society. Despicable cases of this kind dramatically harm the shared life of Israelis and Arabs in the country and destroy solidarity in Israeli soccer,' he added. The Government Press Office (GPO) announced that it had rescinded Hassanin's press pass.

Israeli outlet blames Ben-Gvir for Hamas abusing hostages	Channel 13 publishes report claiming that Ben-Gvir's remarks on conditions of Palestinian prisoners led to worse treatment for Gaza captives; former minister fires back. By World Israel News Staff Channel 13 News blamed statements made by former National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir for the abuses that Hamas hostages endured in captivity, triggering the Otzma Yehudit lawmaker to fire back. The outlet claimed in a report on Tuesday that a recently released hostage said that Hamas had 'worsened' the captives' conditions due to comments made by Ben-Gvir about crackdowns on Palestinian terrorists in Israel prison. The report did not reference the specific remarks made by Ben-Gvir, nor did it reveal which hostage had allegedly made the claim. Shortly after the October 7th attack, Ben-Gvir announced that privileges previously granted to imprisoned terrorists - such as access to entertainment and to a kitchen to make their own food - had been rescinded. Ben-Gvir also implemented changes to the prisoners' diets, removing treats from the menu. Some on the Israeli left decried the moves, claiming that keeping terrorists in stricter conditions would radicalize them further. 'Tonight, Channel 13 News decided to grant legitimacy to the atrocities committed by Hamas against the hostages, with a report claiming that due to the changes I led in the conditions of terrorists in prison, Hamas abused our hostages,' Ben-Gvir said in a media statement. They seem to have forgotten that the terrorists murdered, raped, and massacred Jews long before the reform in the terrorists' prison conditions was implemented. They don’t need any excuse to do this beyond our very existence,' he added. Ben-Gvir stressed that Israel's massive failures on October 7th stemmed from the belief that 'if we just tolerate, submit to the terrorists, and bow our heads, they will graciously agree to stop murdering Jews. We all saw the price of this distorted perception in the horrific massacre.' In a separate report, former hostage Eliya Cohen said that after the successful rescue of four Israeli hostages in June 2024, guards chained him and other captives together for days on end, with the idea that it would make rescuing them more difficult.

EU lawmaker who called Israel ‘terror state’ deported at airport	European Union MP Rima Hassan, who called October 7th terror onslaught 'legitimate,' posts angry tirade on X after being deported from Israel. By World Israel News Staff An anti-Israel European Union lawmaker was denied entry to Israel at Ben-Gurion Airport on Tuesday, with Israeli officials confirming she was deported due to her support for the Hamas terror group. Under Israeli law, foreign nationals who advocate against the State of Israel, including supporting BDS, praising terror groups, or otherwise making statements indicating a fundamental hostility towards Israel, may be denied entry to the country. Syria-born French EU parliament member Rima Hassan posted an angry tirade on social media after she was forced to return to Brussels, Belgium, from where she had departed. Hassan was set to visit Israel as part of a European Union delegation to the region. According to a Times of Israel report, another three members of the EU delegation were also banned from entering. 'The pro-Israel trolls lie just as much as the genocidal state they defend,' Hassan wrote on her X account. 'Israel’s self-centeredness is as infuriating as its propaganda. Passing through its airport was a necessity but our mission was solely in Palestinian territories. It’s time for the EU to act. It’s common for Israel to block parliamentary missions. It has barred UN experts, international NGOs and even the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor.' Notably, Hassan could have chosen to visit PA-controlled territory in Judea and Samaria by flying to Amman Airport in Jordan, rather than transiting through Israel. Hassan has a long history of agitating against Israel, referring to the country as a 'terrorist' state, demanding that Jewish residents of Israel 'leave Palestine,' and claiming that the IDF intentionally 'executes' Palestinian children. She is currently the defendant in an ongoing criminal case in France, due to saying that Hamas' October 7th attack on Israel was 'legitimate.' She has since claimed her remarks were misconstrued. 'Given Hassan’s antisemitic views and support for Hamas, her complaints about Israel only highlight her audacity and reinforce her status as a hostile figure,' Foreign Ministry Director-General Eden Bar-Tal said in a media statement. The Foreign Ministry denied a claim by Hassan that she had previously been approved by a visa, saying they had no knowledge of the matter but would investigate.

Israel finalizes swap with Hamas: 602 terrorist prisoners for 4 d...	There were reports of Hamas agreeing not to hold cruel propaganda ceremonies during the release of the four slain hostages. By World Israel News staff Hamas has announced that it has reached an agreement with Israel for the 'simultaneous' exchange of four Israeli hostages’ bodies and 602 Palestinian security prisoners. This deal resolves a deadlock that had threatened to derail the ceasefire agreement before its first phase could be completed. 'An agreement was reached to resolve the issue of the delayed release of Palestinian prisoners who were supposed to be freed in the last batch,' Hamas said. 'They will be released simultaneously with the bodies of the Israeli prisoners agreed upon for transfer during the first phase, in addition to an equivalent number of Palestinian women and children.' An Israeli official confirmed the agreement. Another source familiar with the matter indicated that Egypt would oversee the exchange. Israel's decision to delay the prisoner release came after Hamas transferred the remains of an unidentified woman on Friday, claiming it was Shiri Bibas. This led to further scrutiny of Hamas’s handling of the deal. The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office cited repeated violations of the ceasefire-hostage agreement as the reason for the postponement, stating that the release would be delayed until more Israeli hostages were secured. Israel had originally been scheduled to release the Palestinian prisoners on Saturday but refused to do so, citing Hamas’s violations of the agreement during the return of the Bibas family’s remains and the propaganda events it has conducted throughout the hostage release process in phase one. Earlier today, there were reports of Hamas agreeing not to hold cruel propaganda ceremonies during the release of the four slain hostages. However, similar commitments were made before the handover of the Bibas family members and the body of Oded Lifshitz but were not honored. As a result, Israel had refused to release the Palestinian prisoners before the Israeli hostages were returned. Hamas claimeed the agreement was finalized during meetings in Cairo between its delegation, led by Khalil al-Hayya, and Egyptian officials.

Mother of American-Israeli captive says ‘Trump understands how to...	Edan Alexander is expected to be released in 'phase two' of the hostage agreement, though his mother Yael emphasized that she doesn't view the releases in terms of phases. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Yael Alexander, mother of American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, credits U.S. President Donald Trump for the release of hostages and states that he knows 'exactly how to get this deal done.' Edan Alexander, the last living American hostage, was raised in the United States and chose to join the IDF rather than attend college. While serving in the Golani Brigade’s 51st Battalion, he was captured by Hamas shortly after a phone conversation with his mother, Yael, during the October 7th attack. Edan Alexander is expected to be released in 'phase two' of the hostage agreement, though his mother emphasized that she doesn't view the releases as simply 'phase one' and 'phase two.' Yael Alexander explained, 'Now, we don’t see it as a phase. We view it as the way to bring our son home. What it’s called doesn’t matter. What matters is that there’s an agreement to bring the remaining hostages home as soon as possible.' She added, 'Time is not on the side of the hostages. That’s why we are so grateful for President Trump’s leadership.' Yael said that from the start, Trump knew 'exactly how to get this deal done.' She praised Trump's leadership, saying it 'has truly changed the situation.' 'We are closer to bringing them home than we’ve been at any point in the last 508 days,' Yael said. '508 days of darkness and uncertainty is too long. It’s time to end it.' In November, Hamas released a video featuring Alexander. His father, Adi, described the video as 'very emotional' and 'disturbing,' though it did provide confirmation that his son was still alive. The recent hostage release deal began on January 19th, just a day before Trump’s inauguration. During the event, Trump took credit for the agreement reached between Israel and the Hamas terrorist organization. The president also hailed the deal as signaling a major shift in the Middle East. 'This week, we achieved an epic ceasefire agreement as a first step toward lasting peace in the Middle East — an agreement that could only have happened as a result of our historic victory in November,' Trump stated.

Berlin chief rabbi welcomes new conservative chancellor Merz	Mr. Merz is a close personal friend and a steadfast ally of Israel,' Rabbi Teichtal said. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News News of conservative Friedrich Merz's electoral victory as the new German Chancellor was met with positive reactions from many Jews in Germany, including Berlin's Chief Rabbi, Yehuda Teichtal. Rabbi Teichtal sent a personal letter to Merz, thanking him for his support of Germany’s Jewish community and his commitment to addressing rising antisemitism. 'Mr. Merz is a close personal friend and a steadfast ally of Israel,' Rabbi Teichtal said. 'Over the years, he has welcomed us many times to discuss ways to strengthen Jewish life in Berlin. It has always been more than just a warm reception.' The letter also emphasized Merz’s belief in Germany’s historical responsibility to support Israel and combat antisemitism. In 2024, Merz expressed support for resuming arms shipments to Israel. Every Chanukah, Merz ensures that a large menorah is displayed in front of his party's headquarters, the Christian Democratic Union. He also attends lighting ceremonies with Rabbi Teichtal. 'After the lighting, Merz told me how happy he was that the menorah stood at party headquarters, but he was even more pleased to see Jewish life in Germany thriving,' Teichtal recalled. 'Congratulations, Friedrich Merz, on your electoral victory. Your friendship with the Jewish people and unwavering support for Israel are invaluable. Your commitment to fighting antisemitism and ensuring a prosperous Jewish future in Germany is truly inspiring.' The European Jewish Congress also welcomed Merz’s victory and the success of his Christian Democratic Union party. However, they expressed concern over the strong performance of the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party in the elections. AfD was founded as an anti-euro party in 2013, but it has since shifted to adopt anti-immigration and nationalist stances. The party has called for moving beyond what they describe as a 'cult of shame' regarding Nazi atrocities. This position was echoed by party figures such as Alexander Gauland, who controversially referred to the Nazi period as 'bird shit' in German history. Despite this, Merz has ruled out cooperation with the AfD, viewing the party as a threat to democracy. 'We have fundamentally different views, particularly on foreign policy, security policy, and many other issues, including Europe, the euro, and NATO,' Merz stated. 'You advocate for the opposite of what we believe in, so there will be no cooperation.'

Mossad chief explains how Hezbollah beeper operation was the ‘tur...	On September 17, 2024, thousands of pagers in the hands of Hezbollah terrorists detonated simultaneously, killing 30 people and injuring 4,000, most of whom were terrorists. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Tuesday, Mossad Director David Barnea discussed the origins of the beeper operation that targeted Hezbollah terrorists and how it became the 'turning point' of the Lebanon War. Barnea explained to the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) that the beeper operation was 'a clear example of the realization of our mission.' On September 17, 2024, thousands of pagers in the hands of Hezbollah terrorists detonated simultaneously, killing 30 people and injuring 4,000, most of whom were terrorists. The pagers, initially possessed by Hezbollah members, were remotely activated months later. The Mossad chief highlighted that the operation 'reflects a deep understanding of the enemy, intelligence mastery, technological superiority, and exceptional operational capabilities.' He further described the operation as a 'turning point' in the northern conflict, marking 'the beginning of the 10 days that shifted the balance in our favor. A clear distinction can be drawn in the northern campaign—from the exploding pagers to the elimination of Nasrallah and the subsequent ceasefire agreement.' Following the attack, Hezbollah's now-deceased leader Hassan Nasrallah acknowledged that Israel had delivered a 'major blow' to the terror organization. Nasrallah stated, 'We undoubtedly suffered a major security and humanitarian blow, unprecedented in the conflict, and perhaps in the history of mankind.' He added, 'We were hit hard, but that’s the nature of war. We understand that the enemy possesses technological supremacy.' The beeper operation followed a similar attempt using walkie-talkies developed ten years ago, which was found to be ineffective in many combat situations. Barnea noted, 'Therefore, we devised an alternative method to target Hezbollah terrorists—by detonating a device that was always attached to their bodies.' Although the operation could have been launched in the days or weeks following October 7, 2023, relatively few pagers had been distributed at that time compared to the larger number used in the operation. 'The preparatory infrastructure for the operation was established in late 2022, with the first shipment of 500 pagers arriving in Lebanon just weeks before the horrific massacre of October 7.' However, Barnea emphasized that launching the operation earlier would not have had the same powerful impact as it did later. By September 2024, Barnea explained, 'Ten times more beepers were detonated than at the start of the war, and twice as many radios were used.' 'The dilemma in launching the operation on September 17, 2024, was significant. In the discussion on whether to approve the operation, two schools of thought emerged, both of which were valid at the time.' He concluded, 'The prime minister ultimately made the decision, completely opposing the prevailing opinion in the discussion, and now we are witnessing the outcome.'

World’s oldest Holocaust survivor dies at 113	It’s pretty incredible. She’s always been so positive. She always says the secret to her longevity is she loves to eat dark chocolate,' granddaughter Gina Bennicasa tells LI Herald. By Jewish Breaking News Before her death at age 113, Rose Girone was not just a number in the record books. The world’s oldest Holocaust survivor carried a century of resilience within her and three secrets to longevity: dark chocolate, loving children, and waking each day with purpose. Born January 13, 1912, in Poland, Girone’s early years saw her family move throughout Europe. By 1938, she had married and settled in Breslau, Germany, just as Nazi persecution of the Jews intensified. The writing on the wall was clear by 1939. With options dwindling, the family fled to the only country still accepting Jewish refugees. After a month-long journey by boat, Girone arrived in Shanghai’s international settlement with her husband and young daughter Reha, briefly finding peace before war engulfed them again. As Japanese forces occupied Shanghai during World War II, the Jewish community was forced into a ghetto. Her family was confined to what had originally been a bathroom. Each day became an exercise in survival. Girone would buy water, bathe her daughter, wash clothes and then the floor of their living quarters all with the same bucket. Even in these desperate conditions, Girone’s resilience shone through. A skilled knitter, she started a small business within the ghetto to earn money for her family. When visas were finally arranged for passage to America in 1947, refugees were forbidden from taking more than $10 each. However, after having earned $80 through her knitting, Girone refused to leave her hard-earned money behind, so she cleverly weaved it into her sweater before arriving at Ellis Island. In New York, Girone reunited with family members who had escaped the Holocaust. Knitting remained the constant thread throughout Girone’s life. She worked in various shops before opening a knitting concession at the Sagamore Hotel in Lake George. Eventually, she saved enough to open a shop in Rego Park and another in Forest Hills, Queens. Even after retirement, her passion continued. She volunteered at libraries, teaching others the craft that had once saved her family from starvation. After a fall at 109, she moved to Belair Nursing and Rehabilitation Center on Long Island for rehabilitation where she became something of a celebrity among residents and staff. Although her body gradually failed her, Girone’s spirit for life never waned. 'It’s pretty incredible. She’s always been so positive. She always says the secret to her longevity is she loves to eat dark chocolate,' granddaughter Gina Bennicasa tells LI Herald. 'She has good children, and she has a purpose. She always said to me, ‘Always have a purpose in life. Get up, and always have a purpose.'' In Rose Girone’s 113 years, she found purpose in survival, in creation, in family, and ultimately in bearing witness to history. With her passing on Tuesday, we lost not just a remarkable Holocaust survivor, but a living connection to a world that sadly grows more distant with each passing day.

‘Hamas treated us like pawns in an evil game’: Noa Argamani recou...	Argamani also recalled being with Yossi Sharabi and Itay Svirsky when they died. Sharabi was killed when the building they were in collapsed during an airstrike, while Svirsky was murdered days later. By Pesach Benson, TPS Former hostage Noa Argamani addressed the UN Security Council on Tuesday, the first captive of Hamas to do so. Hamas abducted Argamani, now 27, and her boyfriend, Avinatan Or, at the Nova Music Festival by Kibbutz Reim on October 7. She was eventually rescued in June 2024 along with Almog Meir, Andrey Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv 'Until Avinatan returns – my heart is captive,' Argamani said as she sat beside Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon. Argamani told the Council it was urgent to secure the release of the remaining hostages as soon as possible. 'We don’t have any more time! I’m here today because it’s a miracle, but there are still 63 hostages living this nightmare. They are in complete darkness, not knowing whether they will live or die in the next moment. Every moment that passes is an eternity of suffering,' Argamani implored. 'We are talking about innocent people who were kidnapped from their beds, from a dance party, from their simple lives – and taken to a world of torture and humiliation. Hamas treated us like pawns in an evil game, driven by cruelty for its own sake,' she said. Argamani also recounted being held with Emily Hand and Hila Rotem, both young girls. Today at the UN security meeting, Noa Argamani told the council about the horrific deaths of Yossi Sharabi and Itay Svirsky. Every second in captivity, the hostages are at the mercy of Hamas. And we know what their mercy looks like. We must bring them home now! pic.twitter.com/8ICjqWBaON &mdash; Hen Mazzig (@HenMazzig) February 25, 2025 'At the time, Emily was eight years old and Hila was 12. I saw the fear in their eyes, the trembling in their bodies. I had to be strong for them, to hide the horrors so that they could survive another day. I told them to ignore all the bombings, all the shooting and everything around,' Argamani recalled. 'They were released in the first deal, and I was left behind. I can’t even begin to explain the feeling of being left behind – but I know that’s exactly what the hostages are feeling right now. Abandoned by the world,' she said. Argamani also recalled being with Yossi Sharabi and Itay Svirsky when they died. Sharabi was killed when the building they were in collapsed during an airstrike, while Svirsky was murdered days later. 'One evening, the house where we were being held was bombed, and we found ourselves buried under the rubble. Itay managed to get up, but Yossi and I were trapped under the piles of concrete. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. I was sucked into the darkness and thought that this was it, these were the last seconds of my life. I screamed with all my might for someone to hear me, and I also heard Yossi’s screams. Screams of pain, of pleas, of a man trapped between life and death. Then, after a few seconds, I heard only silence. Yossi died next to me, alone, helpless,' she recalled. 'Two days after we moved to another house, Itay was brutally murdered by one of our captors. He was with me from the first day of captivity. We talked about our families, about the life we ​​left behind. He was a pure soul. And now he is gone. The international community must understand: our captors are living in hell on earth. They have no time! They have no hope without action.' Soldiers recovered Svirsky’s remains in December. She added, 'What kept me alive in captivity until now is something my mother always told me: ‘Always be good, always hold on to the light.’ So here, in this forum, I will end with these words: Be good. But more than that, be right. Act now. Bring them – all of them – home.' At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 63 remaining hostages, 36 are believed to be dead.

‘We are still not seen’: Displaced Israelis struggle as reconstru...	The report also found that as of February 2025, many temporary housing projects remained incomplete, leaving displaced residents in unstable living conditions. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Bureaucratic delays, political disputes, and housing shortages have stalled reconstruction in Gaza-area communities, leaving many displaced Israeli residents in limbo despite promises of swift rehabilitation and essential funding, Israel’s State Comptroller said in a biting report released on Monday. Tens of thousands of residents of southern communities were forced to evacuate after Hamas’s October 7 attack. 'The findings reveal failures in government preparedness, temporary housing solutions, and long-term reconstruction. It is inconceivable that political disagreements and bureaucratic obstacles prevent the allocation of a NIS 5 billion [$1.4 billion] development budget,' said State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman. The comptroller, also known as the state ombudsman, periodically releases reports auditing Israeli preparedness and the effectiveness of government policies. In the aftermath of October 7, the government established the Tekuma Directorate to oversee reconstruction of homes and infrastructure. But the comptroller’s investigation revealed significant obstacles in implementing these initiatives. According to Englman’s report, government agencies failed to establish a comprehensive emergency housing strategy. Delays in defining the geographical scope of the affected region created legal and financial barriers, to allocating Tekuma’s NIS 5 billion ($1.4 billion) budget. The report also found that as of February 2025, many temporary housing projects remained incomplete, leaving displaced residents in unstable living conditions. The report highlights specific cases where makeshift homes lacked essential infrastructure, posing safety hazards and prolonging the suffering of evacuees. Sharon Segev, a resident of Kibbutz Be’eri told The Press Service of Israel, 'There is a feeling that something new is starting, a great expectation that things will improve, but within all of this, there is also a sense that we are still not truly seen.' Kibbutz Be’eri was one of the hardest-hit Gaza-border communities during Hamas’s October 7 attack. More than 100 terrorists infiltrated the kibbutz that day, killing more than 100 residents and abducting over 30. Many homes were burnt during the fighting. Since then, around 1,000 residents of the kibbutz spent months at a hotel by the Dead Sea before most relocated to Kibbutz Hatzerim in August. 'We were invisible during the long hours we were locked in our safe rooms on October 7, and even now, from the state’s perspective, it seems as if we are taken care of—placed in hotels, with temporary housing being built in Hatzerim,' Segev said. Further compounding the situation, a leadership vacuum in the Tekuma Directorate has exacerbated operational inefficiencies. According to the report, Tekuma, which was established in October 2023 has lacked a permanent director, and that temporary appointments have hindered decision making and coordination among various government ministries. Residents of the hardest-hit communities told the State Comptroller that the absence of clear leadership has directly affected the speed and quality of reconstruction efforts. The report also criticizes the government’s failure to expedite legislative measures necessary for funding and development. Despite a strategic rehabilitation plan being approved in December 2023, political disputes delayed its implementation. The report warned that without urgent intervention from the Prime Minister, critical projects may remain stalled, jeopardizing their long-term viability. Meanwhile, a separate report released last week by the Tekuma Directorate, marking 500 days since the war, provided an official update on reconstruction progress. According to the report, Tekuma’s five-year budget amounts to NIS 19 billion ($5.3 billion), with NIS 7 billion ($1.96 billion) already allocated throughout 2024. Efforts have focused on infrastructure, security, and rebuilding public facilities. Of the approximately 64,000 residents initially displaced, 83% have returned to their homes, with 92% of those who face no security or rehabilitation obstacles already back. However, 13 communities still face restrictions preventing a full return, Tekuma reported. To support those unable to return, hundreds of temporary housing units have been established, with 99% of the necessary interim solutions provided within the first year. Large-scale reconstruction work is ongoing in heavily affected communities such as Ein HaShlosha, Keren Shalom, Nahal Oz, Nirim, and Re’im. In some cases, the rebuilding efforts are progressing ahead of schedule, while others — such as Kibbutz Nir Oz — still await full rehabilitation plans. The restoration of homes in Re’im is expected to conclude by the end of March 2025, with Nirim following by the end of April. 'The residents of the Gaza border communities and western Negev have endured one of the most severe disasters in Israel’s history. Their rehabilitation and the development of their communities must be a top priority for the Israeli government,' said Englman. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 63 remaining hostages, 36 are believed to be dead.

Israel’s top diplomat urges Lebanese people to break free from ‘I...	Lebanon has grown tired of the wars of others on its land,' Lebanese president Joseph Aoun told the Iranian officials. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar has called on the Lebanese people to break free from 'the Iranian occupation,' pushing Israel’s northern neighbor to weaken the political and military influence of the Iran-backed terrorist organization Hezbollah. 'The images from Nasrallah’s ‘funeral’ now precisely reflect the historic crossroads where Lebanon stands: The continuation of the Iranian occupation in Lebanon, through Hezbollah — or liberation from Iran and Hezbollah and freedom to Lebanon,' Sa’ar wrote in a post on X, referring to long-time Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli military strike in September. His funeral was held in Lebanon on Sunday. 'The choice is in the hands of Lebanon and the Lebanese people,' Sa’ar added. The Israeli diplomat’s comments came as Lebanese President Joseph Aoun told a visiting Iranian delegation on Sunday that the country was 'tired' of external conflicts playing out on its territory, asserting that Lebanon is not a battleground for others and hinting at a possible break from Iranian influence. 'Lebanon has grown tired of the wars of others on its land,' Aoun told the Iranian officials, according to a statement released by the newly appointed president’s office. 'Countries should not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.' The images from Nasrallah’s 'funeral' now precisely reflect the historic crossroads where Lebanon stands:The continuation of the Iranian occupation in Lebanon, through Hezbollah - or liberation from Iran and Hezbollah and freedom to Lebanon.The choice is in the hands of… pic.twitter.com/6aDBZCsfYV &mdash; Gideon Sa'ar | גדעון סער (@gidonsaar) February 23, 2025 Iranian officials met Aoun during their visit to Beirut for the funeral of Nasrallah, former leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah, which fought a year-long conflict with Israel in parallel with the Gaza war that ended in a November ceasefire. Nearly five months after his death in an Israeli airstrike, Hezbollah buried Nasrallah in a mass funeral meant to showcase political strength despite the group’s weakened state following the war. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) killed Nasrallah on Sept. 27 last year in an airstrike as he met commanders in a bunker in Beirut’s southern suburbs, delivering a major setback to the Islamist group amid an Israeli offensive. The campaign went on to decimate much of Hezbollah’s leadership and military capabilities through air and ground attacks. Hezbollah’s losses from the war with Israel were further compounded by the fall of its ally, Bashar al-Assad, in Syria, which had long served as a vital supply route for Iranian weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon under Assad’s rule. During Sunday’s high-level meeting, Aoun said Lebanon wanted 'the best relations with Tehran, for the benefit of both countries and people.' According to Aoun’s statement, Iran’s parliamentary speaker Mohammed Bagher Ghalibaf extended President Masoud Pezeshkian’s invitation for Aoun to visit Iran. In a televised address at Nasrallah’s funeral in a Beirut stadium, current Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem declared his refusal to let 'tyrant America' control Lebanon. The United States helped broker the Hezbollah-Israel ceasefire after almost a year of fighting. The conflict, which Hezbollah launched in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas during the early days of the Gaza war in October 2023, resulted in thousands of deaths in Lebanon and widespread destruction across the country’s south. Under the ceasefire agreement, Israel was given 60 days to withdraw from southern Lebanon, allowing the Lebanese army and UN forces to take over security as Hezbollah disarms and moves away from Israel’s northern border. Though Israel has largely withdrawn from the south, its troops continue to hold five hilltop positions in the area, as Israeli leaders seek to reassure northern residents that they can return home safely. Tens of thousands of residents in northern Israel were forced to evacuate their homes last year and in late 2023 amid unrelenting attacks from Hezbollah, which expressed solidarity with Hamas amid the Gaza war. The meeting between Iranian officials and Aoun took place even though regular flights between the two countries had been suspended. On Feb. 13, Lebanon banned flights to and from Iran after Israel accused Tehran of using civilian planes to smuggle cash to Beirut to Hezbollah and warned of possible military action against such flights. In response, Iran barred Lebanese planes from repatriating dozens of Lebanese nationals stranded in the country, stating it would not allow Lebanese flights to land until its own flights could resume in Beirut.

Tehran fears US-Israeli strikes could put its ‘existence in dange...	In related news, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Tuesday dismissed the possibility of direct nuclear talks with the United States. By JNS Iran has put defense systems around its nuclear sites on high alert amid fears of a joint U.S.-Israeli attack, The Telegraph reported on Tuesday, citing two 'high-level government sources' in Tehran. The Islamic Republic is 'just waiting for the attack and are anticipating it every night and everything has been on high alert—even in sites that no one knows about,' one of the sources told the U.K.-based newspaper. Work to fortify Tehran’s nuclear sites 'has intensified over the past year, particularly since Israel launched the first attack' on the Iranian military in response to Iran’s April 13, 2024, missile and drone assault on the Jewish state, he added. The Iranian official who spoke to The Telegraph said there are currently fears in regime circles that 'the U.S. could join in and launch a larger-scale attack that could put the Islamic Republic’s existence in danger.' Remarks by U.S. President Donald Trump about potential plans to strike Iran have further intensified these activities, the source noted. The official acknowledged that further Israeli military action could leave Iran vulnerable, as the country’s air defense systems had been 'heavily weakened' by Jerusalem’s unprecedented Oct. 26 retaliatory airstrikes. 'Several additional [air defense system] launchers have been deployed, but there is an understanding that they may not be effective in the event of a large-scale strike,' according to the official cited by the newspaper. In related news, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Tuesday dismissed the possibility of direct nuclear talks with the United States. 'There will be no possibility of direct talks between us and the United States on the nuclear issue as long as the maximum pressure is applied in this way,' Araghchi said, referring to recent sanctions on Tehran. Last week, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) renewed its threats to launch a third direct missile and drone assault against Israel. 'True Promise III will be carried out at the appropriate time,' Brig. Gen. Ali Fadavi, the IRGC’s second in command, said in comments published by the Islamic Republic’s semi-official Mehr News Agency. Last year, the Islamic Republic conducted two major attacks against Israel, launching nearly 500 missiles and drones at the Jewish state. The assaults, which were largely ineffective thanks to Israeli and allied defense measures that intercepted the vast majority of the projectiles, including guided ballistic missiles, were codenamed 'True Promise I' (on the night of April 13-14) and 'True Promise II' (on Oct. 1) by Iran. Araghchi said in November that Tehran reserves the right to take action against Israel 'at an appropriate time and in a way we think is right.' He made it clear that Iran considers Israel’s October retaliatory strike, that took out most of the regime’s air defenses, as warranting a separate response. In a separate Feb. 18 statement, Brig. Gen. Alireza Sabahifard, who heads Iran’s Air Defense Force, said Tehran was 'ready to deal with any threat because all the equipment we currently have is 100% indigenous.' Sabahifard claimed that the Iranian-produced Bavar 373 air-defense battery 'cannot be compared to any defense system in the world.'

ICC blasts Germany’s next chancellor for inviting Netanyahu	After chairman of Germany's conservative Christian Democrats invited Israeli Prime Minister to visit, International Criminal Court slams pledge to ensure premier will not face prosecution while in Europe. By World Israel News Staff The leader of Germany's largest political party and the candidate most likely to replace outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz came under fire this week, after he invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to visit Germany. On Sunday, an alliance of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU) won a combined 208 seats in the 630-member German parliament, defeating the center-left SPD, which plummeted to third place, behind the rightist Alternative for Deutschland (AfD). The election has positioned CDU/CSU chairman Friedrich Merz as the natural candidate for the chancellorship, though he will face tough coalition talks to secure a majority, so long as he adheres to his pledge not to form a government with the AfD. Hours after his victory, Merz spoke by phone with Netanyahu, who congratulated him on his victory and on becoming chancellor-designate. During their talk, Merz invited Netanyahu to visit Germany, pledging to ensure that the Israeli premier would not face prosecution under the International Criminal Court arrest warrant, issued last year for Netanyahu's involvement in the war against Hamas. 'Chancellor-designate Merz thanked the Prime Minister for the conversation and said that he would invite him to make an official visit to Germany, in overt defiance of the scandalous International Criminal Court decision to label the Prime Minister a war criminal,' the Prime Minister's Office said on Sunday. A day later, Merz confirmed to reporters that he had indeed invited Netanyahu to visit Germany in defiance of the ICC arrest warrant. 'I think it is a completely absurd idea that an Israeli prime minister cannot visit the Federal Republic of Germany,' Merz said. His government, Merz continued, 'would find ways and means for him to visit Germany and leave again without being arrested.' The ICC responded by rejecting the right of individual ICC member states to refuse enforcement of court orders. 'It is not for states to unilaterally determine the soundness of the court’s legal decisions.'

Elon Musk slams Netanyahu trial – ‘Deep state is everywhere’	Billionaire tech mogul and Trump administration efficiency czar Elon Musk takes aim at the Netanyahu corruption trial, defending the Israeli premier while accusing prosecutors of acting as part of the 'deep state.' By World Israel News Staff Billionaire tech mogul and administrator of the federal Department of Government Efficiency Elon Musk defended Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Monday, criticizing the ongoing corruption trial of the prime minister. On Monday night, Musk retweeted a link to a YouTube clip of a two-year-old documentary on the ongoing criminal trial against the prime minister, which combines three separate accusations, spanning Cases 1000, 2000, and 4000. The clip was tweeted last week by Fox News host and conservative pundit Mark Levin, who captioned the link 'The legal war against Netanyahu.' Musk retweeted the link, adding in 'The deep state is everywhere.' The Netanyahu trial, which includes charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust over the prime minister's alleged efforts to speed up already approved regulatory changes in exchange for favorable coverage by the Walla news site, plans to curtail the free distribution of a newspaper in exchange for positive coverage by a rival paper, and help offered to businessmen in exchange for large gifts, was kicked off following the November 21st, 2019 indictment of Netanyahu. While the trial began in May 2020, it has been repeatedly delayed due to the COVID pandemic, Israel's political crisis from 2019 to 2022, and the war in Gaza. Critics have accused prosecutors of attempting a putsch, arguing that there is no legal precedent for considering desirable coverage bribery, and dismissing claims of positive coverage by either outlet cited in the corruption investigations. Musk, who met with Netanyahu earlier this month, was defended by Netanyahu from accusations of antisemitism in January, after some interpreted his hand gesture at a Trump inauguration event as a Nazi salute. 'Elon Musk is being falsely smeared,' Netanyahu tweeted. 'Elon is a great friend of Israel. He visited Israel after the October 7 massacre in which Hamas terrorists committed the worst atrocity against the Jewish people since the Holocaust.' 'He has since repeatedly and forcefully supported Israel’s right to defend itself against genocidal terrorists and regimes who seek to annihilate the one and only Jewish state.'

Hamas using ceasefire period to rearm and rebuild – report	The Gazan terrorist group, far from deterred, is already preparing for another round of fighting, says military reporter. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Far from being deterred, Hamas is using the current ceasefire period to rearm and rebuild so it can attack Israel again, Yediot Ahronot reported Tuesday. Thousands of terrorists have returned to central and northern Gaza, where they had been hiding in refugee camps and preserving their weapons on orders from their top command 'once they realized Hezbollah had abandoned [Hamas],' wrote military reporter Yoav Zitun. The Lebanese Iranian proxy did not try a mass invasion of Israel after the Hamas massacres of October 7, 2023, contenting itself with showing support by firing over 10,000 missiles, rockets, and UAVs at northern Israel over the 15 months of war. The terrorists could move freely among the hundreds of thousands of civilians who started walking back to their hometowns right after the ceasefire began last month, since Israel quickly abandoned the Netzarim Corridor that had divided the Strip roughly in half. Only those going north by car are inspected by security contractors as to their identities and belongings. According to Zitun, these fighters found 'many hundreds of terrorists' who had never left Gaza City and its environs over the course of the war. Together, they have reconstituted themselves into new companies and battalions and staffed them with new commanders, he wrote. While the flow of arms from outside has been halted due to the IDF’s presence on all sides of the coastal enclave, especially on the Philadelphi Corridor at the Egyptian-Gazan border, the terror organization has found an 'inside' source, the report added. 'Hamas has gathered, over the last month, a large amount of explosives from the arsenal of the IDF after it retreated,' Zitun wrote, 'enabling it to booby-trap areas with bombs and create new weapons for its forces.' In January 2024, The New York Times reported that Israeli investigators had found that military-grade contents of Hamas rockets came from unexploded ordnance fired by the Israeli air force in earlier rounds of clashes in Gaza. According to Yediot Ahronot, the group is also repairing tunnels that the IDF damaged and preparing those that were not found, including for offensive purposes. The terrorists have also both set up stationary cameras and begun using drones for observation purposes in many central points in the Strip in an attempt to rebuild its intelligence capabilities. In addition, the report said, 'Hamas has managed to locate and re-aim not a few rocket launchers' that the IDF did not find and destroy during the war. Perhaps to send a message that it is still capable of doing so, they have fired four rockets towards Israel in the last week, although they did no damage, having been shot down or falling within the Strip. In another sign that it has not been deterred, Zitun noted, Hamas has renewed its civilian governance of the Strip, providing municipal services and collecting taxes from the distribution of food and fuel aid that Israel brings in, in order to pay its members’ salaries.' The IDF, he concluded, is finalizing its own preparations for another widespread land and air operation, knowing that while Hamas has been greatly damaged, 'there is still a lot of work to do to finish it off militarily.'

Trump expands sanctions on Iran under ‘maximum pressure campaign’	Oil sales to China, a major source of income, has dropped by more than half since January. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The U.S. government announced Tuesday that it is placing eight more companies on its blacklist as part of President Donald Trump’s 'maximum pressure campaign' against the Islamic Republic. The companies will be sanctioned for 'knowingly engaging in a significant transaction for the sale or transport of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran,' the State Department said. The reason given is that 'Iran continues to destabilize global security with its nuclear threat, ballistic missile program, and support for terrorist groups,' and the sanctions’ purpose is 'to 'stem the flow of revenue the regime uses to fund these destabilizing activities.' The sanctions block the companies and their owners from their American properties, and from receiving funds, goods or services in the U.S. The move is in line with a National Security Presidential Memorandum Trump signed earlier this month 'to implement a campaign aimed at driving Iran’s oil exports to zero.' China is a huge buyer of these products, with a November report by the Congressional Research Service stating that 'nearly all' of Iran’s petroleum exports went in 2024 to the Asian giant. The Chinese have now drastically reduced their purchase of Iranian crude, according to an investigation by the opposition Iran International news service, thus dealing Tehran a heavy financial blow. Citing data by Kpler, a company that provides data and analytics for global trade, the London-based service reported that China’s imports 'fell by more than half in January,' even before the first new sanctions were ordered, compared to October 2024. China implemented its decision by forbidding sanctioned oil tankers from entering its Shandong port, where 90% of Iranian crude is offloaded, Iran International explained. It credited Beijing’s fear of potential sanctions by the incoming administration for the move. The U.S. Energy Information Administration has estimated that Iran’s oil companies earned about $53 billion for the state coffers from their exports in 2023. Others say its petroleum and petrochemical sales generated as much as $70 billion. Sanctioning more companies now for helping Tehran sell its oil will tighten screws that had begun to be applied last year by the Biden administration. After Iran’s first attempted direct attack on Israel with hundreds of missiles and drones in March, the U.S. put sanctions on ports, tankers, and refineries involved in the purchase of Iranian oil, and added dozens more vessels to the blacklist after Tehran tried a second wave in October.

GOP push to deport Ilhan Omar ignites Capitol chaos	Omar’s political resilience is particularly concerning given her history of opposition towards Israel and American support for its closest ally. By Jewish Breaking News Squad member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) hasn’t gained many friends in Congress due to her long time vocal support for Hamas and her radical views. Now, first-term Rep. Brandon Gill (R-TX) is circulating a petition demanding the Arab congresswoman’s deportation through a fundraising campaign titled 'Petition: Deport Ilhan Omar.' 'Friend, we should have never let Ilhan Omar into our country,' the fundraising email reads, as first reported by Axios. 'And frankly, America would be a much better place if she were to be sent back to Somalia.' Gill also accused Omar of 'facilitating a full-scale invasion of our country,' claiming that a 'normal society would refer to that as treason.' Omar quickly hit back at what she called an orchestrated attack on American democracy itself. 'Representative Gill’s attempt to clout chase by threatening to deport a legal US citizen because you disagree with them is directly out of Donald Trump’s fascist playbook,' she said. 'It is truly disgusting that members of the Republican party feel emboldened to engage in racist and quite frankly fascist remarks.' The petition comes after a video went viral last week showing Omar conducting seminars for undocumented Somali immigrants where she told them that they are 'not obligated' to answer questions from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 'The video is manipulated, and I wasn’t even at the event shown,' Omar clapped back on X, adding that 'every single person in this country deserves to know their rights. That’s legal.' Tech billionaire Elon Musk accused Omar of 'breaking the law,' while Democratic colleagues rushed to her defense. Representative Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) called it 'disgusting that Republicans are attempting to raise money by threatening to deport a US citizen just because they disagree with her.' Meanwhile, Representative Mark Pocan (D-WI) demanded immediate action from House leadership. '@SpeakerJohnson, get control of your caucus before we have to take other actions,' he posted on X. 'This is demeaning & embarrassing. We all need to be better than this s***. I expect an answer today.' Omar’s political resilience is particularly concerning given her history of opposition towards Israel and American support for its closest ally. Despite being removed from the House Foreign Affairs Committee last year for her inflammatory remarks, Omar’s constituents in Minnesota seem unfazed by her anti-Israel crusade, having easily won reelection for a third term in November with 56.2% of the vote.

Two suspects detained after crossing from Jordan into Israel; Gol...	In November, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz ordered the construction of a security barrier along the entire border with Jordan to thwart terrorist infiltrations. By JNS Israeli security forces detained two people near the Dead Sea on Monday night who had illegally crossed from Jordan into Israel, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The suspects, believed to be migrant workers, were handed over to authorities for questioning, according to Hebrew media. The incident comes amid increasing tensions along Israel’s eastern frontier with Jordan, which at almost 200 miles is the Jewish state’s longest border. Terrorist infiltrators from Jordan shot and wounded two Israelis near the Dead Sea in October. A month earlier, three security guards at the Allenby Bridge crossing in the Jordan Valley were murdered in a terrorist shooting. The gunman, who according to the IDF was a Jordanian citizen, was killed. He was later named as Maher D’yab Hussein Jazi, a 39-year-old truck driver from the city of Irbid. In November, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz ordered the construction of a security barrier along the entire border with Jordan to thwart terrorist infiltrations. This followed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‘s pledge that Jerusalem would work with Amman to strengthen the eastern frontier to maintain 'peace and security' in the area. Drone incursions The Israel Defense Forces confirmed on Tuesday morning that alerts issued at 8:39 a.m. regarding a suspected hostile aircraft infiltration in the southern Golan Heights were a false alarm. The incident triggered sirens in several communities, and interceptors were launched toward two suspicious aerial targets. The incident has concluded and is under investigation, according to the IDF. No damage or casualties were reported.

Smotrich: Israel to seize land if Gaza hostages aren’t returned	Smotrich also warned that a resumption of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza would 'make more areas look like Jabaliya, and this will convince many Gazans to leave.' By Canaan Lindor, JNS Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on Monday that if Hamas fails to return all of the hostages it is holding by Saturday, Israel will permanently seize land in the Gaza Strip. Speaking at the Sovereignty Conference 2025 in Jerusalem, the Religious Zionism Party head said that if the hostages, both the living and the dead, are not returned by then, 'Israel will expand the agricultural areas of the kibbutzim Be’eri and Nir Oz into the perimeter area of ​​the Gaza Strip.' Kibbutz agriculture, he continued, 'will expand at the expense of Gaza—and this land will remain in our hands forever.' This ultimatum was the most concrete action plan that came out of the conference, an annual event focused on making Judea, Samaria and Gaza inseparable parts of the State of Israel. This year’s conference was held at the Vert Hotel near Jerusalem’s International Convention Center, with some 200 people in attendance. During his address, Smotrich also said that Israel would return to fighting in Gaza, but did not indicate when. 'We are preparing, gaining capabilities, and when we feel we are ready, we will open the gates of hell on Hamas again. It requires patience, but in the end we will bring about the desired outcome,' he said. During a later Q&A with Channel 12 News journalist Amit Segal, Smotrich said that in a year from now, Gaza will be 'held by us, with fewer Gazans and more Israelis moving there. If we take out 10,000 Gazans a day—within four months the Strip will be empty. That would be the best solution—for us and for them.' The conference, which brought together prominent leaders and activists on the Israeli right, highlighted expectations for Israel’s government to change the status quo in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza with support from the U.S. administration. Smotrich is scheduled to visit the U.S. next week for talks with his American counterpart, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, according to a report by Ynet on Tuesday. Several speakers expressed a sense of urgency to leverage what they described as a promising but fleeting geopolitical constellation.

Credit: Molly Riley/White House. Co-produced by the Yesha Council of Judea and Samaria communities, the event has served for over two decades as a platform to advocate making Judea, Samaria and Gaza, or areas therein, part of Israel. Advocates of this move have called for applying Israeli civilian law in those areas, which are currently administered by the Israeli army or the Palestinians. About half a million Jews live in Judea and Samaria, alongside about 2 million Palestinians. The Palestinian Authority administers the major Palestinian population centers in the area. In Gaza, Hamas has been in power since 2007, having overthrown the P.A. Israel pulled out of the Gaza Strip in 2005, uprooting thousands of residents of Israeli communities established in Gush Katif since 1967. The Israel-Hamas war, sparked by the terror group’s Oct. 7, 2023 invasion and massacre, has given rise to hopes for a return by Jewish residents to the Gaza Strip. The current phase of the ceasefire in Gaza is set to expire on March 1, though there is a possibility it may be extended. Smotrich warned on Monday that a resumption of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza would 'make more areas look like Jabaliya, and this will convince many Gazans to leave.' According to an analysis of satellite imagery commissioned by Channel 12 and published earlier this month, 100% of Jabaliya’s 19,000 buildings were destroyed during the war. The overall figure for Gaza was 65%, according to the report. Knesset Member Dan Illouz of the Likud Party argued at the conference that the Trump administration makes sovereignty a 'duty to seize right now,' because it will provide 'a diplomatic Iron Dome, defending sovereignty from the international community, until four years from now, Israeli sovereignty will become consensus and irreversible.' Dan Illouz poses for a picture at the Knesset, the Israeli parliament in Jerusalem on July 30, 2023. Photo by Yonatan Sindel/Flash90. Yesha Council CEO Omer Rahamim concurred, saying: 'If we lose this opportunity, of a U.S. administration that’s to the right of the Israeli government, it will be a historic miss that we will regret for generations.' The Yesha Council is an umbrella organization of local authorities in Judea, Samaria and the Jordan Valley. Rahamim argued for articulating a plan for encouraging Palestinian emigration from Judea and Samaria. 'It’s just like what President [Donald] Trump is envisioning in Gaza. If it works there, it will work here,' he said. Trump has said that he is committed to relocating Gaza’s population. Currently, Israel and Hamas are observing a tense ceasefire. Under its terms, Israel has agreed to free close to 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, including terrorists, in exchange for 25 live and eight deceased hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign in the Gaza Strip after Oct. 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas terrorists invaded Israel and murdered some 1,200 people, abducting another 251. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to dismantle Hamas and retrieve the hostages. Smotrich said on Monday that his Religious Zionism Party will stay in the government if the current phase of the ceasefire with Hamsas in Gaza is extended in exchange for more hostages. His party 'opposes the bad deal with Hamas, which is bad and dangerous, but we decided to stay [in the government]. The deal 'means new victims, new hostages,' Smotrich said, explaining that it would incentivize Hamas to abduct more Israelis. 'We decided not to topple the right-wing government,' said Smotrich. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the head of the Otzma Yehudit Party, pulled out of the government over the ceasefire deal. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a passionate advocate of Israel, sent the conference attendees a recorded video message. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) speaks at the 2024 AmericaFest at the Phoenix Convention Center in Phoenix, Ariz., Dec. 22, 2024. Credit: Gage Skidmore/Creative Commons. 'Israel has an absolute right to determine what happens in Judea and Samaria,' said Cruz. 'This right is described in the Bible and it extends through modern times. As you meet today, have confidence that the American people stand with you. And with President Trump and our new Republican Congress, the American government stands with you as well,' he added. In 2019, during Trump’s first term in office, many Israelis on the right prepared for an application of full sovereignty—dubbed annexation by some—in the Jordan Valley. It did not materialize, reportedly to facilitate the Abraham Accords. Led by the Trump administration, the accords established diplomatic relations between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. Nadia Matar, a prominent Israeli sovereignty activist who also spoke at the conference, advocated pursuing this in a principled fashion. Israel should insist on applying sovereignty in all of those areas and avoid using sovereignty as an instrument of its realpolitik, she said. Nadia Matar attends a press conference near the Knesset in Jerusalem, Israel on June 12, 2023. Photo by Noam Revkin Fenton/Flash90. Matar had opposed the prospect of applying sovereignty only to the Jordan Valley in 2019, she noted. 'We need to apply sovereignty over the whole of the Land of Israel in accordance with the Bible and to not be afraid of saying what will happen with the Arabs,' she said. Whoever’s 'linked to terrorism won’t stay here, would need to leave willingly or otherwise. The few who remain here, we’ll talk with them about residency,' she added. Several speakers, including lawmaker Simcha Rothman from Smotrich’s party, attended last week’s CPAC Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C. Rothman, chair of the Knesset’s Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, said he was impressed by the broad support that Israel enjoyed in the United States, also among conservatives with an America First approach. He remarked on how CPAC demonstrated the commonalities shared by conservative movements internationally.

Poll reveals if Americans back Trump’s plan to move Palestinians ...	Almost half of American voters say they back Trump’s proposal for mass resettlement of Gazans abroad – but few support plan to put Gaza under US control. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Staff Nearly half of American voters support President Donald Trump’s plan, unveiled earlier this month, to resettle Gaza’s entire population abroad to facilitate the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip – even as a wide majority of Americans oppose the president’s proposal for America to take control over the coastal enclave. On Monday, Harvard/HarrisX published a new poll, conducted between February 19 and 20, surveying 2,443 registered voters. The poll found that only about half (47%) of American voters believe Trump is serious about his plan to take control of Gaza and repatriate the area’s population of roughly two million to third-party countries. The remaining 53% believe the president’s proposal is merely a negotiating tactic. Less than one-third (30%) say they support Trump’s proposal to place Gaza under direct American control, but nearly half (44%) back resettling Gazans abroad. The vast majority of Americans, however, say that Hamas should not be allowed to govern the Gaza Strip again after the war with Israel is completed, with just 22% of respondents saying the Islamist terror group should be allowed to rule Gaza. Nearly four-fifths (79%) of Americans say Hamas must release all remaining hostages immediately and unconditionally or face 'serious consequences.' Broken down by party identification, 86% of Republicans, 75% of independents, and 74% of Democrats agreed with the above statement. Americans are divided along partisan lines regarding their perceptions of Trump’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. In total, 54% of the country approves of his handling of the war, including 85% of Republicans, 49% of independents, and 26% of Democrats. More than half (57%) of Americans say the U.S. should aid Israel in carrying out airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear weapons facilities, while an even wider majority (76%) say those facilities should be destroyed, without specifying how or by whom. Republicans were far more likely to support U.S. aid to an Israeli airstrike on Iran’s nuclear facilities, with 74% backing such a move, compared to 45% of Democrats and 51% of independents. Overall, Americans have a net favorable perception of the Jewish state, on par with Ukraine, while the Palestinian Authority and Hamas are both subject to deeply negative net perceptions. Nearly half (43%) say they have a favorable view of Israel – including 16% who have a very favorable view – compared to 30% who have a negative view, including 13% who have a very negative view, for a net positive of 13 points. Ukraine also has a favorability score of 13 points, while Russia has a net score of negative 56, behind China at -45. Thirteen percent of respondents have a favorable view of the Palestinian Authority, compared to 46% who have a negative view, for a net score of -33 – well ahead of Hamas’s net score of -55, with just 8% of Americans viewing the terror group favorably. Over three-quarters (77%) of respondents favor Israel over Hamas. While a partisan gap does exist on the issue, with 85% of Republicans favoring Israel over Hamas compared to just 69% of Democrats and 76% of independents, the most significant predictor was age. Respondents 18 to 24 were almost evenly divided, with just 54% backing Israel over Hamas and 46% favoring Hamas over Israel. By comparison, 93% of respondents over 65 support Israel over Hamas, followed by 86% of respondents aged 55 to 64, 77% of those 45 to 54, 69% of the 35-44 age cohort, and 62% of those ages 25 to 34.

Hamas may halt ghoulish ceremonies to secure prisoner releases	Hamas may commit to quiet releases of slain hostages, after Israel indefinitely delays the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. By World Israel News Staff Hamas is considering accepting a commitment to transferring the bodies of slain hostages without public ceremonies, in order to advance the release of some 600 terrorists from Israeli prisons. On Saturday, Hamas released five Israeli hostages with a public ceremony, parading the frail-looking hostages in front of a cheering crowd and forcing one of the captives to kiss a terrorist on the head. A sixth hostage - a Bedouin-Israeli - was handed over to the Red Cross without fanfare. In an act of psychological warfare, Hamas published a video showing that it had forced two living hostages to watch the release ceremony of their friends. The hostages were then forced to beg for their freedom on camera. Hours later, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israel was indefinitely delaying the release of Palestinian prisoners until Hamas pledges to stop holding release ceremonies. Last week, when Hamas returned the bodies of the Bibas family - who were brutally murdered by their captors - the terror group wrote disparaging messages on their caskets, outraging the Israeli public. This Thursday, Hamas is expected to return the bodies of four slain hostages, but it's unclear if the transfer will take place, as Israel still has not released hundreds of security prisoners who were set for release last Saturday. According to reports from Hebrew-language outlets, Hamas' senior leadership are considering committing to transferring the bodies of two slain hostages without a public ceremony, which would advance the release of prisoners who were expected to be released last Saturday. Hamas may transfer the bodies of two of the slain hostages to Egypt as early as today. Once the bodies are positively identified, Israel will immediately release the Palestinian prisoners, according to a report from Ynet. The current phase of the ceasefire is set to end on March 2nd. President Donald Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff is expected to arrive in Israel on Wednesday in order to broker an extension of the deal, or to facilitate agreements around the second stage of the ceasefire.

Einstein letter offering emigration advice to Jewish refugee to b...	1938 letter penned by Albert Einstein offering advice to a German-Jewish woman seeking refuge from Nazi persecution goes up for sale. By World Israel News Staff A poignant 1938 letter penned by Albert Einstein, offering advice to a Jewish woman seeking to emigrate from Europe to the United States, will be auctioned by Nate D. Sanders Auctions on Thursday, February 27, 2025. The typed letter, signed 'A. Einstein,' is addressed to Mignon Lion, a young German-Jewish woman in France hoping to escape Nazi persecution. Lion, whose mother’s maiden name was Einstein, may have been distantly related to the famed physicist. An immigrant himself to the U.S., Einstein had also fled Nazi persecution, cancelling plans to return to Germany in 1933 while visiting the U.S. following Adolf Hitler’s ascension to power. Residing temporarily in Belgium, Einstein and his wife, Elsa, moved to Britain, amid fears of an assassination plot by German agents in Belgium. In the fall of 1933, Einstein and his wife emigrated to the U.S., after which Einstein was granted a position at Princeton. While Lion and her fiancé eventually relocated to Brazil, her mother tragically perished in Auschwitz in 1945. Her father survived the war and died in New York City in 1964. Dated May 26, 1938, on his personal Princeton stationery, Einstein’s letter provides a realistic assessment of employment prospects in the U.S. He cautions Lion about the difficulty of finding specialized intellectual work, while suggesting possibilities such as domestic service, nursery school teaching, nursing, and handicrafts. He stresses the importance of her fiancé acquiring a viable trade. Einstein also regretfully declines Lion’s request for an affidavit, explaining he had already written too many. This letter offers a glimpse into Einstein’s tireless efforts to assist vulnerable Jews fleeing Europe during this period. While unable to provide direct assistance in this instance, his response demonstrates his concern and willingness to offer practical guidance. The single-page letter, written in German, measures 8.375&#8243; x 11&#8243; and is accompanied by its original envelope, postmarked Princeton, New Jersey, May 26, 1938. Bidding for the letter begins at $5,000.

Lawsuit: Hamas journalist had advance knowledge of Oct. 7	Three rescued Israeli hostage refile lawsuit against US-based nonprofit that employed their Hamas-affiliated captor, who claimed to be a journalist. By World Israel News Staff An amended lawsuit filed against the employers of a Hamas-affiliated Gazan who held three Israeli hostages in his home charges that their captor knew about the October 7th, 2023 terror onslaught in advance. Freed hostage Almog Meir Jan, who was rescued by Israeli forces in June 2024, filed a lawsuit against the Washington-based nonprofit People Media Project and its subsidiary website, the Palestine Chronicle, which employed his captor, Abdallah Aljamal. Aljamal also wrote for Qatar-controlled outlet Al Jazeera. The original lawsuit filed by Jan was dismissed, but has now been refiled with more evidence and the addition of Shlomi Ziv and Andrey Kozlov - who were held alongside Jan and also rescued - as co-plaintiffs. According to court filings viewed by the New York Post, Aljamal had advance knowledge of the attack, proving his deep affiliation and insider connections within the Hamas terror group. On October 7th, 2023, at 5:43 a.m., Aljamal posted an Islamic battle prayer to his TikTok account just minutes ahead of the onslaught. 'Praise be to God, good and blessed praise,' the post reads. 'O God, guide us. O God, guide us. O God, grant us the victory that you promised. O God, acceptance, acceptance, acceptance. Your victory, O God.' Aljamal concluded the post with a heart emoji. The lawsuit argues that Aljamal's employer and Ramzy Baroud, the Palestine Chronicle's editor, obtained exclusive footage and information that made it clear their writer was working on behalf of Hamas. In the aftermath of the October 7th massacres, 'Aljamal’s propaganda in the Palestine Chronicle increased exponentially, often publishing two to three pieces per day, even as the Hamas operative held plaintiffs hostage in violation of international law,' the suit states. The defendants 'knew that Aljamal’s…propaganda could only be made with direct and substantial contacts with other Hamas terrorists providing him information to publish, power for his electronic devices, and Internet access for transmission of materials and communications,' the suit charged. The lawsuit seeks damages from People Media Project, the Palestine Chronicle, and senior figures associated with the entities.

Hamas ‘colonel’ and hospital director admits hostages were kept a...	IDF on arresting Safiya, 'We discovered that the individual orchestrating the terror and Hamas activities within the compound, was the hospital director himself.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A hospital director arrested on suspicion of being a high-ranking Hamas member admitted that hostages were held at the facility. Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital, was arrested in late December alongside hundreds of other terrorists. IDF soldiers discovered extensive Hamas infrastructure at the Kamal Adwan Hospital and suspected Safiya of being a Hamas colonel. Safiya denied being a member of Hamas, despite evidence to the contrary. However, he admitted that hostages were kept at the hospital. When questioned, he claimed they were there to receive medical treatment, though freed hostages who had sustained injuries in captivity reported that they did not receive proper care. In January 2025, an IDF interrogation of Hamas terrorists revealed that the terror group had full control of the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya, Gaza. Israel’s Unit 504 investigators discovered that the hospital director was involved in planning and coordinating terrorist activity and that Hamas terrorists planned to escape from the hospital in ambulances when the IDF raid began. The IDF and Shin Bet, Israel’s security forces, raided the hospital last Friday based on intelligence that terrorists were using the hospital as a headquarters. Approximately 240 Hamas terrorists were arrested in the raid, including many who participated in the October 7 massacre. An IDF reservist described his interrogation of a Hamas terrorist, who admitted that the hospital director was central in directing terrorist activity. The reservist said, 'We discovered that the individual at the center of the event, orchestrating the terror and Hamas activities within the compound, was the hospital director himself.' The reservist added that Dr. Abu Safiya, the hospital director, 'strutted around like a peacock, certain that he wouldn’t be arrested and fully convinced he was in control of the situation.' A second reservist confirmed that the hospital director was indeed a member of Hamas. Abu Safiya 'really did walk around like a peacock,' he said. 'He watched as his doctors were implicated one by one, still convinced he wouldn’t face arrest.' He added, 'But we soon saw through his disguise—it was nothing more than a facade. They were terrorists, with blood on their hands. The hospital director finally realized that the entire ruse had unraveled, and in the end, he too was arrested.'

Hamas official claims October 7th attack wouldn’t have happened i...	Marzouk's admission of regret does not reflect the views of all Hamas leaders, signaling a division within the terrorist organization. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk said that had he known the outcome of the October 7th attack — specifically the destruction in Gaza — the terror group would not have launched the invasion of Israel. His admission of regret does not reflect the views of all Hamas leaders, signaling a division within the terrorist organization. Marzouk, head of Hamas's foreign relations office, told The New York Times that it would have been 'impossible' for him to support the plans for October 7th if he had been aware of the consequences of Israel's military response. Although he was unaware of the specific details of the attack, Marzouk had supported Hamas's general military strategy. He stated, 'Had the consequences of the attack been foreseen, October 7th would not have occurred.' Other Hamas officials have declared 'victory' in the Gaza war, despite the destruction of crucial Hamas infrastructure and the deaths of tens of thousands in Gaza, with at least half of the casualties being members of the terrorist group. Marzouk has indicated he is open to negotiations concerning Hamas's military presence. 'We are ready to discuss any issue,' he told The Times. Marzouk's views contrast with those of Hamas leaders like Osama Hamdan, who has rejected any compromise on Hamas's military control over the Gaza Strip. Marzouk said he would consider a 'comprehensive deal' to release all hostages if Israel agreed to release thousands of Palestinians from prisons, withdrew from Gaza, and ended the war. It remains unclear whether Marzouk's views represent an outlier within Hamas or signal a shift in the group's overall policy. Last week, senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told Qatar-based Al Araby TV that the terror group was prepared to discuss the implementation of Phase Two of the agreement. Hamdan said the group would abide by the agreement: 'If Israel meets its commitments, we will proceed with releasing the hostages as agreed on Saturday or in the coming days.'

Far-Right AfD rises to second-largest party in Germany	Meanwhile, Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats faced a stunning collapse, dropping to just 16.4% from their 25.7% showing in 2021. By Jewish Breaking News A historic wave of German voters braved freezing temperatures on Sunday to cast ballots their ballots. By night’s end, Friedrich Merz’s center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) emerged victorious with 28.6% of the vote. 'Let’s get the party started,' the 69-year-old told supporters at party headquarters in central Berlin. 'My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA.' 'The interventions from Washington were no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow. We are under such massive pressure from two sides that my top priority is to create unity in Europe.' The second major story of the night unfolded at Alternative for Germany (AfD) headquarters, where supporters waved German flags as results showed their party securing 20.8% of the vote to become the country’s second-largest party. Not since the 1930s has a far-right party in Germany gained such a large electoral share. 'Never been stronger,' AfD co-leader Alice Weidel proclaimed to cheering crowds. 'We extend our hand to offer cooperation with the CDU. Otherwise, change won’t be possible in Germany.' Founded as an anti-euro party in 2013 before shifting to anti-immigration and nationalist positions, the AfD has called for moving beyond what they term a 'cult of shame' over Nazi atrocities. A stance echoed by party figures like Alexander Gauland, who dismissed the Nazi period as 'bird shit' in German history. However, Merz ruled out working with AfD, viewing the party as a threat to democracy. 'We have fundamentally different views, for example on foreign policy, on security policy, in many other areas, regarding Europe, the euro, NATO,' he said. 'You want the opposite of what we want, so there will be no cooperation.' Meanwhile, Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats faced a stunning collapse, dropping to just 16.4% from their 25.7% showing in 2021. A subdued Scholz described it as 'a bitter result' and 'a defeat,' while maintaining defiance toward the far right’s gains, declaring it to be 'something that we can never simply accept.'

Israel denies entry to Hamas supporting European Parliament membe...	The 32-year-old French jurist and politician of Palestinian descent is a member of the far-left France Unbowed party and has been vocal in her criticism of Israel. By Pesach Benson, TPS European Parliament member Rima Hassan was denied entry into Israel on Monday, as officials cited her history of support for boycotts and sanctions against the Jewish state. The move came at the directive of Interior Minister Moshe Arbel based on recommendations from the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and the US-based Combating Antisemitism movement. 'Israel is not obligated to admit any foreign official, including parliament members if they work to delegitimize and undermine the state,' said Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli. 'Rima Hassan actively leads hostile campaigns, calls for economic sanctions, and promotes boycotts against Israel. We will use all means available to prevent the exploitation of our democracy for anti-Israeli purposes.' Hassan, who arrived at Tel Aviv’s Ben-Gurion Airport, will be deported to Brussels, from where she departed, the Interior Ministry said. She was intending to visit Palestinian Authority officials in Ramallah. The 32-year-old French jurist and politician of Palestinian descent is a member of the far-left France Unbowed party and has been vocal in her criticism of Israel. Recently, Hassan blamed Israel for the deaths of the Bibas family, repeating claims made by Hamas following their capture. 'Kfir, Ariel, and Shiri Bibas were killed by an Israeli strike,' she wrote on social media. However, Israeli pathologists confirmed that the three were murdered in November 2023. On Sunday, the lawmaker justified Palestinian terror by tweeting 'Resolution 3070 (XXVIII) of the United Nations General Assembly: Reaffirms the legitimacy of the struggle of peoples to free themselves from colonial and foreign domination and control by all means in their power, including armed struggle.' In a November 2024 video, when asked if Hamas terror was justified, Hassan answered 'True,' adding that Israel has no legal right to defend itself. And in May, she called for a boycott of French TV station TF1 after it aired an interview with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Gazan rocket fired at Israel, hits inside Strip	The Israeli military decided on Sunday to 'increase military and operational readiness' in the area surrounding the Strip. By JNS A terrorist rocket that was fired toward Israeli territory fell short and struck inside the Gaza Strip on Monday afternoon, the Israel Defense Forces said. 'The details are under investigation,' the military statement added. According to reports in Palestinian media, the projectile was launched from the city of Rafah, located in the southernmost part of the Strip. On Feb. 13, a 14-year-old Palestinian was killed in Nuseirat in the central Gaza Strip when a terrorist rocket fell short inside the coastal enclave. Unconfirmed video footage posted to social media showed a projectile striking inside a densely populated area shortly after being launched. The Israeli military decided on Sunday to 'increase military and operational readiness' in the area surrounding the Strip. The decision on Sunday night came after a situational assessment, the army statement noted, adding that 'as of now, there is no change in the instructions for the home front.' According to the Channel 12 broadcaster, IDF reinforcements were nevertheless deployed to the border on Monday due to suspicions that Hamas terrorists were planning an attack on Israeli forces in the area. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that it is for the government in Jerusalem to decide whether to resume the war in the Gaza Strip or join the second round of talks with Hamas to free additional hostages. Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Mideast envoy, plans to return to the region this week for talks on extending the current first phase of the ceasefire. The 42-day first phase of the truce is currently set to end on March 1. 'We have to get an extension of Phase 1, and so I’ll be going into the region this week, probably Wednesday, to negotiate that,' he told CNN‘s Jake Tapper on Sunday. 'And we’re hopeful that we have the proper time … to begin Phase 2 and finish it off and get more hostages released.' Witkoff said he believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is 'well-motivated' to see the agreement with the terrorist group continue. 'He wants to see hostages released; that’s for sure. He also wants to protect the State of Israel. And so, he’s got a red line. And he said what the red line is, and that is that Hamas cannot be involved in a governing body when this thing is resolved,' Witkoff said of the expected talks.

Senator Fetterman’s staffers quit in protest of his support for I...	At least six aides to the Pennsylvania Democrat have resigned recently in protest of his pro-Israel stance. By World Israel News Staff A number of staffers working for Senator John Fetterman have resigned recently in protest of the Pennsylvania Democrat’s open support for the State of Israel during its war against the Hamas terror organization, Yedioth Aharanoth reported Sunday. The number of resignations rose to six on Friday, with the departure of Communications Director Charlie Hills. Fetterman’s Legislative Director Tré Easton has also announced his plans to leave Fetterman’s office, a departure which will raise the number of resignations to seven. A month earlier, Fetterman’s communications director, Carrie Adams, resigned after she went public with her dissatisfaction with the senator’s positions vis-à-vis Israel and the war against Hamas. 'I don’t agree with him,' Adams told The Free Press. 'I have a sense that his international views are a lot less nuanced than my generation, because when he was growing up, it was might makes right, and for my generation and younger who, of course, are the ones protesting this, they have a much more nuanced view of the region.' Adam Jentleson, Fetterman’s chief of staff and three top communications staffers have also quit over the last year. Citing sources familiar with the resignations, Sunday’s report claimed that the staffers quit due to differences with the senator regarding Israel. One former staffer claimed that the office work environment was 'almost entirely consumed by Israel-related matters.' Fetterman, who campaigned as a progressive in the competitive 2022 Senate race in Pennsylvania, has since frustrated some within the Democratic caucus, softening his positions on some issues and at times cooperating with Congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump. Earlier this month, Fetterman became the sole Democrat to vote to confirm Trump’s Attorney General, Pam Bondi, who was confirmed by the Senate 54 to 46.

Israeli President: ‘No one must be left behind’	Israel suffering immense pain' over killings of Bibas family, says President Herzog, adding that the Jewish state cannot leave any hostages behind in Gaza. By World Israel News Staff Israeli President Isaac Herzog called Monday to ensure that every Israeli hostage held captive in the Gaza Strip is returned home, as he lamented the 'immense pain' suffered by Israelis following the confirmation that the Bibas children were killed in captivity. Speaking at the 22nd Jerusalem Conference of the Sheva Media Group on Monday, Herzog said Israel was in the midst of a 'profoundly historic period,' facing continuing threats and an ongoing 'difficult war.' 'First and foremost, we are living in a profoundly historic period for the Jewish people,' said Herzog. 'We are committed to strengthening the people of Israel in the face of the threats that surround us, and this difficult war.' 'We are committed to embracing and supporting the bereaved families who have paid an immense price for our independence, our resilience, and our victory, and to working toward bringing our sons and daughters home. 'Michal and I have met with over a thousand bereaved families this year. The people of Israel are extraordinary—diverse, fascinating—and each family has its own story. I bow my head in remembrance every single day.' Responding to the return of the remains of the two youngest captives taken hostage on October 7th, 2023, Kfir and Ariel Bibas, along with the return of the body of their mother, Shiri Bibas, Herzog castigated the 'heinous' murder of the three, and acknowledged the 'immense' national pain following their return. 'As a nation, the issue that weighs on us most heavily is that of the hostages. The pain is immense, and I know that all of Israel was in deep, national mourning when we learned of the heinous murder of the Bibas family and Oded Lifshitz. At the same time, we long for, rejoice, and weep as we see hostages returning home—they are our brothers and sisters.' Amid fears the ceasefire and hostage deal between Hamas and Israel may not survive to its second phase, Herzog emphasized the importance of returning every hostage from captivity. 'I believe that we must bring them all home and make every possible effort to complete their return, doing whatever is necessary to ensure that not one is left behind.' 'I have had close and personal conversations with both returning hostages and the families of those still held captive. For me, the commandment of redeeming captives is a supreme duty that embodies the highest bond between a nation and its citizens.'

Hitler-loving fighter set to fight Israeli opponent in Denver	Mitchell went fishing for a date with Hitler, and now he’s got a date in the octagon with the living embodiment of Jewish survival. By Jewish Breaking News Mixed martial arts has had its fair share of meaningful fights over the years. But none quite like this one, where timing and circumstance have conspired to create something that feels almost too perfect. Just recently, featherweight Bryce Mitchell was interviewed on the debut episode of 'ArkanSanity' and proceeded to torch his own reputation in spectacular fashion. Between casual sips of whatever was in his cup, Mitchell declared Adolf Hitler was a 'good guy' he’d love to hang out with. 'I really do think before Hitler got on meth, he was a guy I’d go fishing with. He fought for his country. He wanted to purify it by kicking the greedy Jews out that were destroying his country and turning them all into gays,' he said. 'They were gaying out the kids. They were queering out the women. They were queering out the dudes.' 'When you realize there’s no possible way they could’ve burned and cremated six million bodies, you’re gonna realize the Holocaust ain’t real.' The interview dated Jan. 23 was quickly yanked from YouTube over violations of its hate speech policy while UFC CEO Dana White called it the dumbest thing he’s heard in his decades-long career. 'When you talk about Hitler, he was responsible for the death of six million Jews and he tried to completely eliminate a race of people,' White fumed during a pre-fight press conference on Feb. 1st. 'Hitler was one of the most disgusting and evil human beings to ever walk the face of the Earth. And anyone that even tries to take an opposing position is a moron.' 'That’s the problem with the internet and social media; you provide a platform for a load of dumb, ignorant people. We’ve obviously reached out to Bryce, and when we read what he said and let him know what we feel about it, we are beyond disgusted. For those of you who don’t know what’s going on, good, you’re lucky.' Mitchell has since offered what amounts to a tap out of an apology. 'I’m sorry I sounded insensitive. I definitely was not trying to offend anybody, but I know I did. I know that a lot of people died in the Holocaust, and that’s a fact. In the future, I will be much more considerate when talking about the suffering of all peoples,' he wrote on Instagram. 'Hitler did a lot of evil things, I think we can all agree on that. I’m definitely not a Nazi, and definitely do not condone any of the evil things Hitler did.' Now Mitchell’s headed to the PIT Submission Series on Feb. 28 to face Ilay Barzilay, and no publicist’s spin or half-baked apology can sanitize what this Denver fight represents. Mitchell went fishing for a date with Hitler and now he’s got a date in the octagon with the living embodiment of Jewish survival. The kind of poetic justice you can’t script, wrapped in four-ounce gloves and sanctioned by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.

Meet the terrorist overseeing Abbas’s ‘reformed’ payment system f...	According to Israeli media, the officials described Abbas’s purported reform 'a deception, a cosmetic move, and a facelift designed to gain legitimacy with the U.S. administration.' By Andrew Tobin, The Washington Free Beacon Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas fired his prisoners’ affairs commissioner this week, seemingly demonstrating new seriousness about reforming the system of payments for terrorists that the commissioner oversaw and vocally defended. But Abbas simultaneously replaced the former commissioner, Qadura Fares, with another convicted terrorist and leading proponent of the payments, Raed Abu al-Humus. The incoming boss quickly confirmed his support for killing Israelis. Just hours after his appointment, the Commission of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs published a photograph of Abu al-Humus smiling alongside two arch-terrorists, Ahmed Barghouti and Mohammed Aradeh, whom Israel recently released to Cairo as part of a hostage-ceasefire deal with Hamas. Barghouti, 48, was sentenced to 13 life sentences for orchestrating a series of terrorist attacks that killed 12 Israelis and wounded dozens, and Aradeh, 42, was given life in prison for attempted murder and other crimes. The photo is among a number of early signs that Abbas will once again disappoint international donors who expect him to end 'pay for slay,' as critics call the Palestinian Authority’s longstanding payments to security prisoners and the families of terrorists killed while carrying out attacks against Israelis. 'The problem is the Palestinian Authority believes that terrorists are the most honored people, and they still believe they’re the most honored people,' Itamar Marcus, the director of Palestinian Media Watch, an Israeli watchdog group that has closely tracked the terrorism payments for years, told the Washington Free Beacon. 'They are not saying they’ve decided it’s wrong to reward terrorists. They are saying that this [reform] is something we were forced to do because we’re in a financial crisis. That’s why there’s no meaning to this, and that’s why there’s no reason for any optimism.' In a vaguely worded presidential decree last week, Abbas revoked the Palestinian Authority’s 'financial allowances to the families of prisoners, martyrs, and the wounded' and made the recipients 'subject to the same standards applied without discrimination to all families benefiting from protection and social welfare programs, in accordance with the standards of comprehensiveness and justice.' Abbas also transferred oversight of the terrorism payments from the prisoners’ affairs commission to the Palestinian National Economic Empowerment Institution, a body controlled by his office. International media hailed the move as the 'end' of the terrorism payments and a 'serious reform.' European Commission officials called the 'awaited decree law' a 'significant political development' that 'signals the Palestinian Authority's commitment to implement far-reaching reforms that will improve its efficiency and stabilise its fiscal situation.' 'A reformed and revitalised Palestinian Authority remains at the core of efforts towards a two-state solution,' the officials added in a statement this week. 'Therefore the [European Union] stands firm in its support to the Palestinian Authority and calls on international partners to provide the Palestinian Authority with political and financial support to empower the Palestinian government to continue to pursue its ambitious reform agenda.' A State Department spokesman said last week that Abbas’s decree 'appears to be a positive step and a big win for the Trump Administration.' However, earlier this week, the Trump administration froze funding for the Palestinian Authority Security Forces. Meanwhile, Palestinian officials have reassured the Arab public that the terrorism payments will continue. Abbas affirmed his commitment to the payments at a meeting of his Fatah political party’s parliamentary body on Friday, using the same uncompromising language that he and other Palestinian leaders have often used in the past. 'We repeat and emphasize that we are proud of the sacrifice of the martyrs,' Abbas said in televised remarks. 'Even if we only have one cent left, it will go to the prisoners and martyrs. They must receive everything as in the past, for they are more precious than all of us put together.' Qatar’s Al-Sharq newspaper quoted unnamed senior Palestinian officials last Wednesday as saying the terrorism payments would continue 'without any reduction.' The officials reportedly explained that Abbas’s decree was a response to growing U.S., European, and Israeli financial pressure that has left the Palestinian Authority $3 billion in debt to local banks and unable to borrow more. Munir al-Jaghoub, a senior Fatah official, told the UAE’s Al-Mashhad TV a day earlier that Abbas 'did not stop anyone’s salaries.' According to al-Jaghoub, the president simply 'issued a law to transfer these salaries to another entity that is not subject to restrictions' by the European Union. Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar told international media on Tuesday that the Palestinian Authority has continued 'with its usual deception and its pay-for-slay strategy.' 'Based on their statements and intelligence we have, payments to families of terrorists proceed this week as always,' Saar said. 'The [authority] continues to finance and encourage terrorism.' Saar’s remarks echoed a reported assessment by senior Israeli security officials at a security cabinet meeting on Tuesday. According to Israeli media, the officials described Abbas’s purported reform 'a deception, a cosmetic move, and a facelift designed to gain legitimacy with the U.S. administration.' Abbas’s office, the Commission of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs, and the National Economic Empowerment Institution did not respond to requests for comment. In 2018, the last year the Palestinian Authority published a budget, the terrorism payments totaled $340 million, or 7 percent of planned spending. Abbas’s Palestinian Authority has long used diplomatic and accounting maneuvers to evade international pressure to end the terrorism payments. In 2020, Abbas backed out of negotiations with the Biden administration to reform the system, and in 2014, he attempted to hide the payments by temporarily shifting their distribution to the PLO’s Commission for Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs. In the early 2000s, Israel brought in three top international accounting firms as part of an effort to block the PLO’s diversion of funding for the second intifada, a yearslong wave of Palestinian terrorism. But according to Yossi Kuperwasser, then the head of Israeli military intelligence’s research division, the accountants found the Palestinians’ bookkeeping impenetrable. 'It took exactly three months for these elite companies to declare they were leaving because they couldn’t do the job,' Kuperwasser, who went on to become the director general of Israel's Ministry of Strategic Affairs and now heads the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security think tank, recalled to the Free Beacon. 'All through these games and tweaks, the Palestinians kept paying the salaries to terrorists. So I doubt we are going to see a change this time.' If the Palestinian Authority were to end or significantly reduce the payments, prisoners and their families would undoubtedly lead mass protests that could threaten the authority’s survival, Kuperwasser, Marcus, and other Israeli experts on the Palestinian Authority agreed. The experts said that many of the Palestinian Authority officials in charge of the terrorism payments have long been convicted terrorists who served time in Israeli prisons, and that is unlikely to change. Marcus pointed to Abu al-Humus as an example. While Abu al-Humus’s prisoners’ affairs committee no longer formally oversees the payments, he is listed online as a board member of the body that does, the National Economic Empowerment Institution. 'This is the Palestinian Authority,' Marcus said. 'And the Palestinian Authority is a terror-supporting entity.' In 2022, Abu al-Humus, then the head of international relations at the prisoners’ affairs commission, effusively praised Nasser Abu Hamid, a late founder of Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades terrorist group who died of cancer in Israeli prison while serving seven life sentences for murdering Israelis. Abu al-Humus, who spent 10 years in prison alongside Abu Hamid for his own involvement in terrorism, remembered his late comrade as a 'masked lion' and an 'inspiration' to the 'Palestinian youth.' 'He was not interested in political work but rather focused greatly on the struggle [against Israel],' Abu al-Humus told the Palestinian Wattan News Agency. 'He worked with his colleagues in the resistance to end [Israel] and sweep it from the Palestinian land.'

'I hope you never set a foot into the White House briefing room, you Hamas-propagandizing ghouls,' he wrote. 'Drop dead.' By JNS The Associated Press drew widespread criticism, including from members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, for stating that Shiri Bibas and her sons Ariel, 4, and Kfir, 9 months, 'died in captivity.'Close-up of a sign with 'The Associated Press' logo. 'Hamas murdered these hostages. They didn’t just ‘die in captivity,’ as if by natural causes,' wrote Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). 'Why does AP want to sugar coat this?'

'The AP chooses to whitewash the baby killers, calling them ‘militants’ rather than terrorists and claiming the children ‘died’—rather than were murdered—in captivity. Disgraceful.' 'If you are supposed to be the press, then why, why, why can’t you report some facts accurately,' wrote Todd Richman, co-chair of Democratic Majority for Israel. 'She and her sons did not die in captivity. They were murdered! Her babies were choked to death! Shame on you.' Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) wrote a similar response, as did Donald Trump Jr., one of the U.S. president’s sons. David Harris, a former CEO of the American Jewish Committee who is executive vice chair of the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy, wrote that the AP meant 'genocidal terrorists' when it referred to Palestinian 'militants,' and that the news wire was wrong to say the Bibas children and their mother 'died in captivity.' 'No, AP, Shiri Bibas and her young sons, Ariel and Kfir, were kidnapped and murdered by genocidal terrorists,' Harris wrote. 'AP says it’s committed to ‘highest standards of accurate, unbiased journalism.’ Really?' 'Are you actually kidding me AP,' wrote Mark Goldfeder, director of the National Jewish Advocacy Center. 'Died in captivity!? Is it not enough that you hire known Hamas members as photographers, do you now just spout their disinformation for them?' John Podhoretz, the editor of Commentary magazine, referred to U.S. President Donald Trump barring the AP from press briefings. 'I hope you never set a foot into the White House briefing room, you Hamas-propagandizing ghouls,' he wrote. 'Drop dead.'

The two-state solution is dead, says senior Democrat congressman	Rep. Jim Himes, Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee who formerly backed the two-state solution, now acknowledges the idea is likely 'dead.' By World Israel News Staff A senior Democratic congressman said this week that the two-state solution appears to be dead - done in by Hamas invasion of Israel in October 2023. On Sunday, Rep. Jim Himes (CT-D) appeared on Fox News to discuss the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and Trump administration efforts to cut wasteful spending. Himes, a long-time supporter of Palestinian statehood and the two-state solution, acknowledged in the interview that the two-state solution no long appears to be relevant. Responding to a Newsweek article published last week under the headline 'The Two-State Solution Died With Ariel and Kfir Bibas,' referring to the two young Israeli hostages murdered in captivity in Gaza, Himes said the two-state solution likely was already dead, following the invasion of October 7th, 2023. 'As it happens, I just spent a week in Israel and had about two hours with the prime minister, and I think the two-state solution died not with the brutal murder of these hostages, but frankly, it has been on life support for a very long time and the Hamas attack on Israel&#8230;probably ended that.' Himes added that Israel was likely to resume its war against Hamas, citing the terror group's ongoing abuse of hostages, including parading those set to be released. 'You just can't see hostages treated the way these hostages have been treated.' Hamas, Himes continued, must be 'taken out of the equation.' While acknowledging that the two-state solution appears to been rendered irrelevant, Himes said he hoped that Israel and the Palestinian Authority would engage in talks to de-escalate tensions in Judea and Samaria. 'There needs to be some solution,' Himes said. 'There are millions of Palestinians who are enraged.' 'Israel will never be secure as long as they are living in a very small sliver of land with millions of enraged Palestinians.'

Israel lifts all restrictions on northern border communities	This decision enables northern communities to fully resume normal activity, with displaced residents scheduled to return home on March 2. By JNS The Israel Defense Forces Home Front Command has lifted all remaining restrictions on communities along Israel’s northern border, initially imposed due to hostilities with the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah. Sunday’s announcement followed a situational assessment led by IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and approved by Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz. Per the new order, the border zone shifted from 'partial activity' to 'full activity' as of 8 p.m. Sunday local time. This decision enables northern communities to fully resume normal activity, with displaced residents scheduled to return home on March 2. The public is instructed to follow updated guidelines available on the National Emergency Portal and the Home Front Command app. Also on Sunday, the IDF raised its alert level in the border area surrounding the Gaza Strip, though no new instructions have been issued for area civilians.

How hostage Omer Shem Tov observed Sabbath in Hamas tunnels	His mother, Shelly, pointed out that she had begun doing the same exactly one year before her son was freed. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Omer Shem Tov, one of the six hostages freed on Saturday, began observing the Sabbath while alone in Hamas captivity, his mother said Sunday. His childhood friend, Itay Regev, who, together with his sister Maya, were with him before being freed in the first hostage deal seven weeks into the war, had spoken out before about how 'one of the things we all missed the most was the Kiddush Friday night,' a benediction said over wine or grape juice at the start of the Sabbath meal. 'Since he was a small boy, Omer was the one who said the kiddush,' his mother, Shelly, recalled. 'One day, they received a small bottle of grape juice and some salted pretzels,' she said. 'They took the salt off the pretzels' and saved it all carefully. 'Every Friday night they took a piece of toilet paper and put it on their heads as a kipah, and Omer said Kiddush,' she continued. They would pretend that a few pretzels were the challah bread eaten at the start of the meal, and Omer would salt them, as is traditionally done, and say the blessing. As other hostages have also mentioned to their loved ones upon release, Omer’s faith in God grew stronger when he was in the terrorists’ hands, Shelly said. She, too, began observing the Sabbath, she said, after joining a weekend run by the group Kesher Yehudi (Jewish Connection), when dozens of hostage families observed the holy day the Orthodox way together with religious families. 'It was a Shabbat that I will never forget - the first Shabbat in my life that I observed according to its rules,' she recalled on Friday as she looked forward to seeing her son. 'The connection between the families of the kidnapped and the ultra-Orthodox families who surrounded us was amazing. We hugged, prayed, sang, and spent a holy Shabbat.' Shelly marveled at the timing of her son’s release, exactly one year later. 'There is no coincidence in the world; everything from Him is blessed, and everyone is a messenger,' she wrote, adding that since then, 'More than I kept Shabbat, Shabbat kept me, and by God's grace, on this Shabbat I will get to hug my Omer, exactly one year later, and it's amazing how precise everything is.' Omer was the hostage ordered by a Hamas photographer for propaganda purposes to kiss a terrorist on the forehead while standing on the stage for the handover ceremony to the Red Cross, as if in thanks for good treatment received as a prisoner. While certain Arab networks seized that footage to 'prove' how humane the terrorists were, Omer was in fact treated horrifically. 'For 450 days, Omer was held alone in a tunnel in difficult conditions that included starvation and psychological torture part of the time,' Shelly said Sunday evening at a press conference. He was not given any medication for his colitis either, she noted. This was the medical condition that had made him eligible to be released as a 'humanitarian case' during this first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. 'Omer shared that all he dreamed of doing when he returned home was to put his head on my lap, and for me to comb his hair, and go out riding with [his father] on the motorcycle and feel the spirit of freedom,' she said. 'When he crossed the border&#8230; the first face he met was that of a psychologist who introduced herself by name, and the first thing he asked for was her permission to give her a hug because he was thirsty for human touch, warmth, and love,' she added.

Trump backs Israel halting release of 600 terrorists	After Netanyahu announces Israel freezing of terrorist releases over Hamas' abuse of hostages - both living and dead - at mass ceremonies - White House gives its backing to Israel's decision. By World Israel News Staff The White House on Sunday announced that it is backing Israel's decision to suspend the release of jailed Arab terrorists in exchange for the return of Israeli hostages from Gaza, after Hamas repeatedly put hostages up on display before freeing them. Over the weekend, the Prime Minister's Office announced that 'in light of the repeated violations by Hamas — including the ceremonies that demean our hostages’ dignity and the cynical use of our hostages for propaganda purposes — it has been decided to delay the release of terrorists planned for yesterday until the next release of hostages is guaranteed, and without the humiliating ceremonies.' The statement was issued hours after Hamas paraded five frail Israeli hostages in front of cheering crowds on Saturday ahead of their transfer to the Red Cross. During one of the ceremonies, Omer Shem Tov, who was kidnapped from the Nova Music Festival, was forced to kiss his captor on the forehead. Last Thursday, Hamas displayed the remains of slain hostages, including two children, on a stage at a victory ceremony in Khan Yunis. On Sunday, White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes castigated Hamas' behavior, and said that Israel's response is 'appropriate.' 'Given Hamas' barbaric treatment of the hostages, including the hideous parade of the Bibas children's coffins through the streets of Gaza, Israel's decision to delay the release of prisoners is an appropriate response.' President Donald Trump, Hughes continued, said he is 'prepared to support Israel in whatever course of action it chooses regarding Hamas.' In exchange for the latest hostage releases, Israel had been slated to release 602 jailed Arab terrorists this weekend. A senior Hamas official, Basem Naim, warned that unless the terrorists are released, Hamas will not engage in talks with Israel for the implementation of the second phase of the ceasefire.

Bedouin hostage’s father demands Arab world condemn Hamas	We want the Arab world to voice their opinion: What do they think about the fact that innocent people were kidnapped and murdered?' By World Israel News Staff A Bedouin-Israeli father of a recently released hostage, who was held by Hamas for more than a decade, is demanding that the Arab world speak out against the terror group's atrocities. Shabaan a-Sayyid's son Hisham, who has schizophrenia, crossed into the Strip in 2015. He was returned to Israel on Saturday in a near-catatonic state, and appeared to not recognize his own relatives. Speaking to Hebrew-language media, a-Sayyid urged Arab countries to condemn Hamas, whom he said had acted contrary to Islam in their abusive treatment of his son. 'I saw that Bedouins and Arabs were killed, working people who weren’t soldiers or fighters,' said a-Sayyid, referencing the October 7th massacres. 'The Arab world doesn’t react, doesn’t give any response to that, doesn’t take any stance,' he said. 'We want the Arab world, and particularly Arab society in Israel, to voice their opinion: What do they think about the fact that innocent people were kidnapped and murdered?' A-Sayyid said he was shocked by the horrendous treatment his son apparently suffered. 'At the start of [Hisham's] captivity, when there were four hostages in Gaza, I thought that Hamas members would keep him safe,' a-Sayyid said. He said he believed that Hamas understood 'it was in their interest' to ensure his son remained in a good state, so that he could be exchanged for Palestinian terrorists in Israeli prisons. But 'when we got Hisham back, we were relieved to see him walking on his own two feet, but as I held him in my arms, I realized I was hugging a body… not a human being.' The father added that Hisham 'doesn’t talk. He doesn’t have a voice. He can’t remember anything. It’s like he hadn’t been with other human beings.' At least 17 Bedouins were murdered during the October 7th onslaught, and eight were kidnapped. Some were killed by rocket fire, while others were shot to death by rampaging terrorists. One Bedouin man abducted by Hamas, Farhan Al-Qadi, was kept in a subterranean tunnel and given barely enough food to survive, despite being a Muslim.

Freed hostages were isolated in tunnels, starved, and degraded	On Saturday, Hamas released Tal Shoham, Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen, Avera Mengistu, and Hisham Al-Sayed to Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The six hostages freed on Saturday, like others who have been released, have shared stories of deprivation, humiliation, abuse, starvation, and isolation during their captivity in Gaza. On Saturday, Hamas released Tal Shoham, Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen, Avera Mengistu, and Hisham Al-Sayed to Israel. Most of the freed hostages describe being held in isolation in tunnels and given very little food. Eliya Cohen was shackled for much of his captivity and was kept alone in darkness. Occasionally, his captors would shine a flashlight in his eyes to create mental confusion. Cohen was captured at the Nova Music Festival and fled into a 'death shelter,' into which terrorists threw grenades that caused now-deceased hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin to lose his arm. Eliya was shot in the leg and did not receive adequate medical attention from his captors in Gaza. He learned only after his release that his partner had survived the terror attack. Hamas captors made Omer Shem Tov disguise himself as a Muslim woman. He was spat on and forced to kiss terrorists in a ceremony. Shem Tov managed to maintain Jewish observance during his captivity and tried to make kiddush with whatever he had. In the final eight months, Shem Tov, Tal Shoham, and Omer Wenkert were held together in a tunnel where they endured extreme humidity and were given very little food. The hostages reported losing track of time and having no idea what month it was. Until he was placed in a tunnel with two other hostages, Wenkert had been held in complete isolation and had no idea there were efforts to free him and the other hostages. Two of the hostages, Hisham Al-Sayed and Avera Mengistu, were held for over a decade in Gaza. Al-Sayed's appearance has entirely transformed, and medical staff have reported that he is suffering from severe psychological trauma. Mengistu greeted his family but has said very little since his release.

Bibas family thanks public for ‘warm embrace, tears’	The family added that those who wish to pay their final respects to Shiri, Kfir, and Ariel can do so along the funeral route, which will be publicized. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Family members of murdered hostage Shiri Bibas and her children Kfir and Ariel issued a statement on Sunday thanking the public for its support. Yarden Bibas, the only member of his family released alive from Hamas captivity, and Dana Siton Silberman, the sister of Shiri Bibas, released a statement following the confirmation that Shiri, Kfir, and Ariel were murdered by terrorists. 'During these painful and difficult days, there are no words to describe the level of gratitude we feel towards all of you. The warm embrace, love, and strength that you have sent us from all over Israel and the world strengthen us and accompany us in these moments of crisis.' They added, 'We feel the open hearts, the immense embrace, your pain alongside ours – which we do not take for granted.' The statement continued, 'This Wednesday, we will accompany Shiri, Kfir, and Ariel on their final journey. We are aware that many of you wish to be there, to pay your respects, express your love, and say your goodbyes with us.' 'However, in order to allow the family to say their goodbyes in the most personal and intimate way, and due to space limitations, the funeral ceremony itself will be limited to family members and close friends.' The family added that those who wish to pay their final respects to Shiri, Kfir, and Ariel can do so along the funeral route, which will be publicized. Additionally, the family is coordinating live-streamed eulogies that will be available for the public to watch. The family concluded, 'We thank you all from the bottom of our hearts – for the love, the embrace, and the tears we have all shared. We do not have enough words to express our appreciation for all that you have given us during this time.'

Air Canada returns to Israel’s skies	With a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas still holding, North American air travel has steadily been returning to Israel. By Jewish Breaking News When Air Canada suspended flights last October, thousands were left navigating complex alternatives through European hubs. A brief attempt to resume service ended abruptly after Iran’s April attacks, but now the airline is committing to a steady return. Starting June 8, Air Canada’s familiar red maple leaf returns to Ben Gurion Airport, with four weekly flights scheduled for Toronto service. Montreal follows in August with a weekly connection, marking the first direct service between Canada and Israel since El Al’s withdrawal in 2022. 'Air Canada has a long-standing commitment to the Canada-Israel route, which we have operated for the past 30 years. We look forward to resuming flights and even expanding them as conditions allow,' the airline announced Thursday. With a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas still holding, North American air travel has steadily been returning to Israel. United Airlines announced resumption of service again on March 15, while Delta eyes a return on April 1. According to the Israel Airport Authority (IAA), about one-third of the 80 airlines that serviced Tel Aviv before the Gaza war have now resumed operations. Wizz Air has already rapidly expanded its network by adding seven new destinations, including Abu Dhabi, Budapest, Krakow, London, Milan, Rome, and Warsaw. Major European carriers, including Air France, British Airways, and the Lufthansa Group have also since resumed service.

Israel sent forces into the 235 sq km buffer zone to prevent Syrian rebels from approaching the border when Turkish-backed Islamist rebels toppled Assad government. By Sveta Listratov, TPS Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for the demilitarization of southern Syria and protection for its Druze community on Sunday, the first time he has publicly called for this since the collapse of Bashar Assad’s regime in December. 'We demand the full demilitarization of southern Syria,' said Netanyahu, who was addressing a graduation ceremony for cadet officers in Beer-Sheva. 'We will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria.' Netanyahu also held up a photo of Shiri Bibas and her sons, Ariel and Kfir whose remains were recently returned to Israel. Forensics experts who examined the bodies said they had been murdered, and that there was no evidence to back Hamas claims they were killed during an Israeli airstrike. 'This picture says it all, and I ask that you engrave it on the tablet of your hearts so that we always remember what we are fighting for and who we are fighting against,' Netanyahu said. 'In the last days of the war, [Hamas] murdered Shiri and her children in cold blood. They strangled the tender children with their own hands, and if they could, they would have murdered all of us with the same cruelty,' he added. Regarding Iran, Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel’s long-standing stance, declaring, 'We will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons.' Israel sent forces into the 235 sq km buffer zone to prevent Syrian rebels from approaching the border when Turkish-backed Islamist rebels toppled Assad government. Israel also launched waves of airstrikes on Syrian army assets and Iranian stockpiles to prevent them from falling into the hands of radical Islamists. Israel considers the 1974 ceasefire agreement void until order is restored in Syria. While Israeli forces have briefly entered the buffer zone in the past, December’s takeover marked the first time since its establishment that the IDF set up positions there. The demilitarized zone was established with a ceasefire in 1974 that ended the Yom Kippur War.

Israeli forces bust Jordanian weapons smuggling ring, arrest 10 s...	The leader of the network, Fuaz Altohi, 28, a resident of the Bedouin Negev town of Bir Hadaj, allegedly paid members tens of thousands of shekels for their participation. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli security forces dismantled a Jordanian weapons smuggling ring, authorities said on Sunday. Ten suspects were arrested as the Israel Defense Forces, Police and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) seized 34 pistols and four long-barreled weapons. The network’s operations focused on moving firearms from the Jordanian border into Israel and then to Judea and Samaria. 'This operation highlights the direct link between arms smuggling at the borders and the supply of weapons to Judea and Samaria, including terrorist organizations. This poses a severe threat to national security,' the Shin Bet said. According to the findings, the group executed at least two major smuggling operations in the latter half of 2024. Smugglers used vehicles crossing from Jordan to transport large quantities of weapons. The leader of the network, Fuaz Altohi, 28, a resident of the Bedouin Negev town of Bir Hadaj, allegedly paid members tens of thousands of shekels for their participation. He also collaborated with two Israeli citizens, a father and son from the Negev, to distribute the smuggled weapons. Security forces believe the weapons ended up in the hands of criminal groups and terror organizations. An indictment filed in Beer-Sheva District Court included charges of illegally possessing and trafficking firearms, damaging IDF property, facilitating illegal border crossings, and drug-related offenses. In the request for pre-trial detention, prosecutors highlighted the rising trend of illegal weapons from Jordan and Egypt flooding Israel.

Witkoff to visit Israel in bid to extend first phase of Gaza host...	Witkoff said he believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is 'well-motivated' to see the agreement with the terrorist group continue. By JNS Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy for the Middle East, plans to return to the region later this week for talks on extending the current first phase of the ceasefire and hostage release deal with the Hamas terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip, he told CNN on Sunday. 'We have to get an extension of Phase 1, and so I’ll be going into the region this week, probably Wednesday, to negotiate that,' the Mideast envoy told Jake Tapper on the channel’s 'State of the Union' program. 'And we’re hopeful that we have the proper time … to begin Phase 2 and finish it off and get more hostages released,' Witkoff continued. The first 42-day phase of the truce is currently set to end on March 1. Witkoff said he believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is 'well-motivated' to see the agreement with the terrorist group continue. 'He wants to see hostages released, that’s for sure. He also wants to protect the State of Israel. And so he’s got a red line. And he said what the red line is, and that is that Hamas cannot be involved in a governing body when this thing is resolved,' Witkoff said of the upcoming talks. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar told reporters on Feb. 18 that the Israeli Cabinet has decided to start talks on Phase 2 of the ceasefire. As part of the talks, Jerusalem will demand the complete disarmament of Hamas and other terrorist organizations in the Strip, Sa’ar stressed. And as part of Phase 2, Jerusalem will reportedly also demand the release of all hostages in addition to the expulsion of the Hamas leadership from Gaza and the dismantling of its terrorist army. Officials in Jerusalem believe that Hamas is likely to reject the demands. Asked about Netanyahu’s demands, Witkoff told CNN, 'I would say at this point, for sure, they can’t be any part of governance in Gaza.' He added, 'As to existing, I’d leave that detail to the prime minister.' Trump said on Friday that it is for Jerusalem to decide whether to resume the war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip or join the second round of talks to free additional captives. Asked by Brian Kilmeade on Fox News whether he was 'okay either way,' Trump answered, 'I am.' Israel on Saturday redeemed six living hostages from Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip: Eliya Cohen, 27, Avera Mengistu, 39, Hisham al-Sayed, 36, Omer Shem Tov, 22, Tal Shoham, 40, and Omer Wenkert, 23. According to official estimates, 63 hostages remain in Hamas captivity in Gaza more than 500 days after the terrorist group’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre, 36 of which have officially been confirmed as having been murdered.

Israel challenges Egypt on secret Sinai military buildup	Cairo has constructed military bases in Sinai 'that can only be used for offensive operations, for offensive weapons—that’s a clear violation,' Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Yehiel Leiter said in a Jan. 28 briefing. By Shirit Avitan Cohen, JNS Senior Israeli officials have approached Egypt regarding serious violations of peace agreement terms following mounting evidence of Egyptian military buildup in Sinai that exceeds previously agreed limits. Sources familiar with the matter said Egyptian officials proposed U.S. mediation to reduce growing tensions between the nations. The Israeli diplomatic messages were conveyed amid increasingly concerning social media posts showing the Egyptian army allegedly conducting exercises preparing for a potential invasion of Israel through Sinai. In recent discussions between the sides, Egyptian officials expressed their own concerns, stating that 'entities with foreign interests aiming to destabilize relations between the countries are responsible for distributing the videos, some edited and some fabricated.' Egypt additionally proposed resolving its Sinai violations through accelerated bilateral dialogue to bridge gaps. These diplomatic exchanges follow last month’s remarks by Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Yehiel Leiter, who characterized the situation as 'intolerable' in a meeting with American Jewish organization leaders. Cairo has constructed military bases in Sinai 'that can only be used for offensive operations, for offensive weapons—that’s a clear violation,' Leiter said in the Jan. 28 briefing, a recording of which was shared by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. Egypt’s breach 'is an issue that is going to come to the fore because it’s not tolerable,' the Israeli diplomatic envoy explained. 'For a long time, it’s been shunted aside, and this continues. This is going to be an issue that we’re going to put on the table very soon and very emphatically.' Satellite images indicating changes in Egyptian army deployment in the Sinai Peninsula have reportedly led security coordinators in Israeli border towns to paint a worrying picture of recent developments. Security and diplomatic sources confirmed Egypt’s pattern of introducing forces into Sinai in violation of agreements over the years, only requesting Israeli approval after the fact—which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu consistently granted. Yagil Henkin, a military affairs expert who first warned about concerning trends from the south in 2018, explained: 'This happened through creeping annexation. First, they would bring in forces, then retroactively request Israeli approval, which was always given. Even after operational needs ended, forces were not withdrawn.' In recent days, Cairo’s official rhetoric has escalated in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan for relocating Palestinians from Gaza. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has made clear that he will not allow the move to happen, even postponing a planned visit to the White House. In his speech to the Conference of Presidents, Leiter said el-Sisi 'plays both sides of the equation, but he is threatened by the Muslim Brotherhood.' If the Israeli military decisively defeats the Muslim Brotherhood branch in the Gaza Strip—Hamas—el-Sisi is 'going to be more open to cooperate with us on the ‘day after’ Hamas,' he argued. The Israeli envoy called it 'unconscionable that Egypt wouldn’t entertain the possibility of at least temporarily housing some of the [Palestinian] refugees, particularly in light of the fact that members of Sisi’s family are running a travel agency in which they take tens of thousands of dollars from Gazans who want to get out of the area.'

‘Fear got us here, and if we don’t fight, we will lose’ – Legenda...	The Hamas-led massacre on October 7 should have been a moment of reckoning for Jews worldwide. Instead, far too many still refuse to see the truth, says prominent radio host. By Linda Argalgi Sadacka, Exclusive to World Israel News In a no-holds-barred conversation, legendary radio host Sid Rosenberg rips into the explosion of antisemitism, the failures of Jewish leadership, and the urgent need for Jews to take control of their own destiny. Known for his unapologetic, brass-knuckled honesty, Rosenberg isn’t here to play nice. He’s here to tell the truth: Jewish survival has never been about playing defense—it’s about fighting back. And if we don’t, we will lose everything. Jewish survival is a battle—not a birthright Jewish history isn’t defined by victimhood—it’s defined by resilience. But Rosenberg sees today’s Jewish leadership as weak and ineffective. 'When I was a kid, the JDL was tough. The ADL was tough. Neither of them is as tough as they used to be,' he says bluntly. The lesson of Jewish survival is simple: strength is the only deterrent. Yet today, too many Jews are afraid to stand up for themselves—especially those who still blindly support a party that openly harbors antisemites. 'Democrat Jews seem okay with people stepping all over them. There’s no other explanation for why they keep voting for a party that coddles Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, and AOC.' This isn’t about political preference—it’s about self-preservation. And right now, Jewish leadership is asleep at the wheel. Sid Rosenberg and author Linda Sadacka at Bedminster for a Trump Jewish Leader's event. (Courtesy) Antisemitism is institutionalized—and Jews are in denial Jew-hatred isn’t just lingering in the shadows. It’s embedded in the very institutions shaping the country. 'We see it every day at Columbia, NYU, and in Congress—Tlaib, Omar, AOC. Even Jews like Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders do a terrible job representing us,' Rosenberg states. The media only adds fuel to the fire. 'CNN spends all day crying about Palestinian ‘victims’ while barely acknowledging what happened to Jewish women and babies on October 7. It’s pure propaganda.' The greatest mistake Jewish leaders are making? Failing to recognize that antisemitism isn’t just random hate—it’s a systemic problem. 'This isn’t a fringe issue—it’s institutional,' he warns. 'And it’s time we fight it like one.' October 7th: The wake-up call that never came The Hamas-led massacre on October 7 should have been a moment of reckoning for Jews worldwide. Instead, far too many still refuse to see the truth. 'The reason October 7 happened is simple: Iran,' Rosenberg says. 'They bankroll Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis. They couldn’t do it when Trump was in office because Iran was broke. The moment Biden took over, Iran was back in business.' And yet, inexplicably, Jews continue to vote for leaders who fund their executioners. 'More than 50 percent, more than 60 percent of Jews still support these policies. Was October 7 a wake-up call? Maybe for me—I became more religious, more outspoken. But for too many? They’re still asleep.' The Jewish community must stop being afraid Fear has paralyzed Jews into submission. And according to Rosenberg, that’s why attacks keep happening. 'If some thug rips a yarmulke off a kid’s head, and that kid beats the hell out of him, maybe he won’t do it again. But we don’t do that. The Jewish response has been to walk away, dejected, scared. And that’s why it keeps happening.' This isn’t about promoting violence—it’s about ensuring that threats against Jews are met with swift, unshakable resistance. 'Those who seek to harm Jews should know there will be a cost,' Rosenberg says. When enemies of the Jewish people see no consequences for their actions, when there is no pushback, no price to pay, it emboldens them. A response isn’t just necessary—it’s survival. The WZO elections: The fight for Jewish power While most people see elections through a political lens, Rosenberg views them as a battle for Jewish survival. 'This election isn’t some symbolic nonsense,' he says. 'This determines how Jewish money is spent, who gets to represent us, and whether Israel will be strong or weak.' Donald Trump is awarded the Theodor Herzl Gold Medallion at the Zionist Organization of America's 125th anniversary Gala in New York City, Nov. 13, 2022. (ZOA) The Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) World Likud is running as Slate 15 in the upcoming World Zionist Congress (WZC) elections, which will take place online from March 10 to May 4, 2025. These elections will determine how over $1 billion is allocated annually toward Jewish and Israeli causes. And the ZOA isn’t just about Jewish power—it stands by Torah values, the anchor that has kept the Jewish people rooted, protected, and unwavering throughout history. For thousands of years, it has never been politics, diplomacy, or compromise that ensured Jewish survival—it was faith, identity, and unbreakable Jewish strength. In an age where Jewish voices are under attack, where so-called leaders bend to every social pressure, ZOA stands firm: Israel is the eternal homeland of the Jewish people, and Jewish destiny will not be dictated by outsiders. Yet, this year, a new threat has emerged: a slate of brand-new groups with zero track record, no proof they can fight, and no experience in standing up for Jewish rights. 'These new slates popped up overnight. No history, no credibility. And we’re supposed to entrust them with the future of Jewish power?' Rosenberg asks. This is not the time for experiments. This is a fight for the Jewish future, and it must be waged by those who have proven their strength. How Sid got into the fight: 'Linda, you were relentless' Rosenberg wasn’t planning to join this battle—he was dragged into it by people who refused to take no for an answer. 'Linda, you were relentless,' he laughs. 'You sent Elizabeth Pipko, Elisheva Chase, and others after me. You made the calls. But in the end, it was Siggy Flicker—my good friend—who sealed the deal. And I’m damn glad she did, because ZOA is the real deal.' For Rosenberg, this isn’t about just another election—it’s about who actually fights for Jewish power. 'A lot of groups just talk—they hold rallies, tweet, and put out statements. But what does that actually accomplish? Nothing.' 'ZOA fights where it matters—in Congress, in court, on the front lines for Israel and the Jewish people.' Real fighters vs. social media celebrities Rosenberg has no patience for performative activism. 'There are people out there making a fortune off this since October 7. They love the photo ops. They have millions of followers. But the real fighters? They’re not the ones tweeting—they’re the ones actually in the trenches.' Ava Rosenberg with her father Sid Rosenberg, a prominent national radio show host. (Courtesy) For him, the ultimate example of Jewish courage isn’t an influencer—it’s his own daughter, Ava. 'What impresses me? Not influencers lighting menorahs with Van Jones for $50,000 a pop. It’s my daughter, Ava. She’s on a college campus, putting her life on the line for the Jewish people when it’s dangerous, when it’s damn near deadly. That’s leadership.' Final message: Fight or be erased Jewish history does not reward weakness. It rewards strength, defiance, and the courage to fight back. We are not guests in this world. We are not here to beg for approval, apologize for our existence, or tiptoe around the sensibilities of those who hate us. The Torah is our anchor. It is the foundation that has carried us through every exile, every war, every attempt to erase us. It commands us to be strong, to fight for our people, and to never surrender our destiny to others. The battle lines have been drawn. The enemy is emboldened. Jewish survival has never been guaranteed—it has always been earned. So stand up. Speak out. Vote. Fight back. Because if we don’t fight for ourselves, no one else will.

Trump’s pick for UN envoy uses CPAC speech to call for ‘eradicati...	‘It has never been more important to show unequivocal support for Israel,’ says New York congresswoman tapped by President Trump to serve as Ambassador to the United Nations. ‘Never forget that Hamas terrorists savagely murdered 1,200 innocents.' By World Israel News Staff A Republican lawmaker tapped by President Donald Trump to serve as America’s ambassador to the United Nations used her speech at the largest annual gathering of conservative activists to reaffirm support for Israel and to call for the ‘eradication’ of the Hamas terror organization. New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik appeared at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland on Saturday, lauding President Trump’s position on the Israel-Hamas conflict while lambasting the United Nations relief agency UNRWA. Amid accusations of ties to terrorism – including to Hamas and terrorists involved in the October 7th invasion – Stefanik called to 'dismantle' the agency. 'Make no mistake. Hear it now,' Stefanik told CPAC attendees. 'We will not only defund UNRWA, we will dismantle it,' calling the UN agency a 'pro-Hamas terrorist group that committed atrocities on Oct. 7.' During his first term as president, Trump defunded UNRWA, a move which was later reversed by his successor, President Joe Biden. However, in 2024, following revelations of involvement by UNRWA employees in the October 7th massacres, the Biden White House suspended funding for UNRWA, while finding alternative mechanisms for supporting international aid to Palestinians in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza. While the Biden-era freeze is slated to expire next month, UNRWA funding is also restricted by a January 20th executive order signed by Trump after returning to office, freezing nearly all foreign aid. Stefanik called for the ‘eradication’ of Hamas, citing the murder of Israeli hostages returned to Israel last week – including three members of the Bibas family. 'It has never been more important to show the world’s unequivocal support for Israel. We will not rest until every hostage is brought home and Hamas is eradicated.' 'This past week, we continue to see with crystal clarity that our fight to support Israel and eradicate Hamas is a fight between good and evil, light and darkness, life and death.' 'The world must never forget that Hamas terrorists savagely murdered over 1,200 innocent civilians—including women, children, the elderly and babies—and took hundreds hostage, committing unspeakable atrocities against humanity.'

40,000 Palestinians evacuated as IDF deploys tanks in Samaria	For the first time since 2002, IDF tanks roll into Jenin as Israeli Defense Minister signals Israel will maintain long-term presence in the city, noting 40,000 Palestinians evacuated. By World Israel News Staff IDF tanks rolled into the Palestinian Authority city of Jenin in northern Samaria on Sunday, marking the first time since the Second Intifada that Israeli armored units have operated in the area. On Sunday morning, photographs and video began circulating on social media outlets showing Israeli Merkava main battle tanks being deployed to Jenin and nearby Arab villages. An IDF spokesperson later confirmed that tanks were operating in the area as part of the ongoing Israeli counter-terror operation in Samaria. Since January 21st, Israeli forces have killed more than 70 terrorists and detained 300 suspects in Operation Iron Wall, carried out in the Jenin district of northern Samaria and Tulkarem and the nearby Nur al-Shams in western Samaria. The operation was launched after Palestinian Authority security forces failed to take control of Jenin from rogue terror groups, and following the January 6th shooting attack in Samaria that left three Israelis dead. Later on Sunday, Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) discussed the expansion of Operation Iron Wall, saying that some 40,000 Arab residents have been evacuated from the targeted areas. 'The IDF is expanding its operations in northern Samaria and, as of last night, is also operating in the town of Qabatiya as part of Operation Iron Wall to combat terrorism in Judea and Samaria. The military is reinforcing its forces with armored units and additional troops,' Katz said in a statement. 'So far, 40,000 Palestinians have evacuated from the refugee camps of Jenin, Tulkarm, and Nur al-Shams, which are now empty of residents.' Furthermore, Katz said the Israeli military will remain in parts of Jenin and Tulkarem for an extended period of time, without giving a deadline for their withdrawal. 'We are at war against Islamic terrorism in Judea and Samaria. I have instructed the IDF to prepare for a prolonged stay in the cleared camps for the coming year—to prevent the return of residents and the resurgence of terrorism.' During the recent operations, Katz added, IDF forces have shut down operations by the terror-linked United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). 'UNRWA operations in the camps have also been halted.' 'We will not return to the previous reality. We will continue to clear refugee camps and additional terror hubs to dismantle the battalions and terror infrastructure of radical Islam, which were built, armed, funded, and trained by Iran's axis of evil in an attempt to establish an eastern terror front against the settlements of Samaria, the security barrier, and major population centers in Israel.'

Terrorist murderer dies in accident days after release	Na'el Obeid, a terrorist convicted of seven murders for role in suicide bombing attack, dies in accident at his Jerusalem home, just days after he was released as part of the hostage deal between Hamas and Israel. By World Israel News Staff A convicted terrorist from Jerusalem, responsible for a deadly terrorist attack more than two decades ago, died over the weekend in an accident just days after he was released from prison. Last week, Israel’s Prison Service released Na’el Obeid, a Jerusalem resident convicted during the Second Intifada of helping to carry out a suicide bombing at an Israeli café in the capital. The September 2003 Café Hillel bombing left seven Israelis dead and 57 more injured. The victims killed in the suicide bombing attack included two Americans: Dr. David Applebaum and his daughter, Nava Applebaum, who was murdered on the eve of her wedding. Other victims of the bombing include, David Shimon Avizadris, Shafik Kerem, Alon Mizrachi, Gila Moshe, and Yehiel Tubol. Following his capture, Obeid was tried and convicted for his role in planning the attack and aiding the suicide bomber. Obeid was sentenced to seven consecutive life sentences, plus 30 years in prison. Prior to his release last week, Obeid had served 21 years of his sentence. In exchange for the release of three Israeli civilians freed on February 15th – including Sagui Dekel-Chen, Alexander 'Sasha' Troufanov, and Iair Horn – Israel released 369 jailed Arab terrorists, including Obeid, who returned to his home in the Issawiya neighborhood of eastern Jerusalem. This Saturday, however, Obeid was rushed to Hadassah Medical Center on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem after he suffered critical injuries. Obeid was reportedly injured after falling from the roof of a building Issawiya. After being evacuated to the hospital in critical condition, Obeid was later declared dead by doctors at Hadassah.

Pope is conscious, receiving supplemental oxygen, had a peaceful ...	His condition has revived speculation about what might happen if he becomes unconscious or otherwise incapacitated, and whether he might resign. By The Associated Press Pope Francis was conscious but still receiving high flows of supplemental oxygen Sunday following a respiratory crisis and blood transfusions, as he remains in critical condition with a complex lung infection, the Vatican said. The brief statement early Sunday didn't mention if Francis was out of bed or eating breakfast, which it had on previous days. 'The night passed quietly, the pope rested,' it said. The Vatican later said Francis was conscious, continuing to receive supplemental oxygen and that further clinical tests were being conducted. A more detailed medical update was expected later Sunday. On Saturday, doctors said the 88-year-old pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, was in critical condition after suffering a prolonged asthmatic respiratory crisis while being treated for pneumonia and a complex lung infection. The pope received 'high flows' of oxygen to help him breathe through a nasal tube. He also received blood transfusions after tests showed low counts of platelets, which are needed for clotting, the Vatican said in a late update. The Saturday statement also said that the pontiff 'continues to be alert and spent the day in an armchair although in more discomfort than yesterday.' Doctors said the prognosis was 'reserved.' Doctors have said Francis’ condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease. His condition has revived speculation about what might happen if he becomes unconscious or otherwise incapacitated, and whether he might resign. Prayers for pope at Vatican Francis was supposed to have celebrated Mass on Sunday morning in St. Peter's Basilica and ordained deacons as part of the Vatican's yearlong Holy Year commemoration. The organizer of the Holy Year, Archbishop Rino Fisichella, celebrated the Mass in his place and offered a special prayer for Francis from the altar before delivering the homily the pope had prepared. 'Even though he is in a hospital bed, we feel Pope Francis close to us, we feel him present among us,' Fisichella told the hundreds of white-robed deacons. 'And this compels us to make even stronger and more intense our prayer that the Lord will assist him in his time of trial and illness.' A pre-written message that Francis had prepared for his Sunday noon prayer but did not deliver said he was 'confidently continuing my hospitalization at the Gemelli Hospital, carrying on with the necessary treatment; and rest is also part of the therapy!' The message noted the upcoming anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, 'a painful and shameful occasion for the whole of humanity.' The main threat facing the pope is sepsis Doctors have warned that the main threat facing Francis would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia. As of Friday, there was no evidence of any sepsis, and Francis was responding to the various drugs he is taking, the pope’s medical team said in their first in-depth update on the pope’s condition. Saturday’s blood tests showed that he had developed a low platelet count, a condition called platelopenia or thrombocytopenia. Platelets are cell-like fragments that circulate in the blood that help form blood clots to stop bleeding or help wounds heal. Low platelet counts can be caused by a number of things, including side effects from medicines or infections, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Francis, who has chronic lung disease and is prone to bronchitis in winter, was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors first diagnosed the complex viral, bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs. They prescribed 'absolute rest' and a combination of cortisone and antibiotics, along with supplemental oxygen when he needs it. Vatican hierarchy tamps down speculation Francis might resign Meanwhile, the Vatican hierarchy went on the defensive to tamp down rumors and speculation that Francis might decide to resign. There is no provision in canon law for what to do if a pope becomes incapacitated. Francis has said that he has written a letter of resignation that would be invoked if he were medically incapable of making such a decision. The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, gave a rare interview to Corriere della Sera to respond to speculation and rumors about a possible resignation. It came after the Vatican issued an unusual and official denial of an Italian media report that said Parolin and the pope’s chief canonist had visited Francis in the hospital in secret. Given the canonical requirements to make a resignation legitimate, the implications of such a meeting were significant, but the Vatican flat-out denied that any such meeting occurred. Parolin said such speculation seemed 'useless' when what really mattered was the health of Francis, his recovery and return to the Vatican.

Israeli hostages forced to watch as other captives set free	Hamas released a propaganda video of Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evyatar David forced to watch from a van Saturday as other hostages were released. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Two hostages were forced by Hamas to watch its choreographed ceremony in which three Israelis were released Saturday in Rafah, and were filmed begging repeatedly for their own freedom. Looking extremely gaunt, Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal, dressed identically in light sweaters in the freezing cold, can be seen in a van first covering their eyes with their hands in disbelief as they watch Omer Shem Tov, Tal Shoham and Omer Wenkert up on a stage being forced to speak before being taken to Red Cross vehicles. Sitting across from well-armed terrorists, the two then face the camera and say, 'Please save us, bring us home, I’m begging you.' They are cruelly asked in Hebrew, 'How do you feel right now?' and they repeat with tears in their voices, 'Please let us go home, we’ve been here 500 days, please save us&#8230; we want to be like them,' nodding at the Israelis being humiliated in the handover ceremony. The door of the van is then slammed shut and they say to the camera in separate shots that have been obviously pieced together, '[Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, you’ve finished us off, you killed us here&#8230; We need proper negotiations, simply sign on a deal and finish this, we’ve just seen our friends released after 500 days, [if you use] military pressure, we’ll all die&#8230;. People of Israel, don’t stop demonstrating, it is so hard for us here.' Right-wing members of the government have been demanding that the IDF return to crush Hamas instead of agreeing to a Phase 2 where the IDF would fully withdraw from Gaza in return for the 63 remaining hostages, only 27 of whom are still alive. Galia David, Evyatar’s mother, was interviewed Sunday by several radio stations after the two- minute clip was released. She told Army Radio that while 'it was obvious that he had been staged,' her son was still obviously 'frightened and frustrated' and that 'his whole body language expressed distress.' David was relieved that her son was at least with his close friend in captivity, saying that it was a 'consolation' that he and Gilboa-Dalal were 'alive and together,' and adding that 'I have no doubt that they give each other a great deal of strength.' 'But I see the soul through his eyes and he is tormented, my son is tormented. He is pale and thin, but we keep saying - the body can be healed, the soul is much more difficult,' she said. 'We must save them, and as quickly as possible. If it doesn’t happen now, I don’t know how much longer they can hang on there.' On Channel 12, she also slammed Hamas’ malice, noting that the terrorists 'let him look at his friends who were with him in the tunnels and are going home, and then sent back to the darkness to wander in the tunnels when he doesn't know what's happening to him. This is simply cruelty.' Hamas terrorists abducted Gilboa-Dalal and David from the Nova festival on October 7, 2023, among 249 others during their invasion of Israel in which they slaughtered 1,200 people, the vast majority of them civilians.

US Rep. Nancy Mace torches colleague Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for...	Mace was responding to an April 2024 clip from The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, in which Ocasio-Cortez accused Israel of inflicting a famine on Gaza as revenge for Oct. 7. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner US Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) has lambasted fellow Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) over her previous suggestions that the United States cut funding to Israel for humanitarian purposes. Mace posted on social media that she is currently visiting Israel to witness the aftermath of the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks which left roughly 1,200 dead and 250 abducted. 'I’m in Israel where last night 3 buses were bombed. I’m here to see the evil that invaded Israel and deeply harmed her Jewish people on 10/7,' Mace wrote. 'We gave $9 billion in humanitarian and disaster aid for Gaza last year – at least half of which, $4.5 billion since AOC can’t count, ended up funding terrorism. Our resources have enabled mass terrorism in Gaza and elsewhere. See UN and USAID as additional examples,' Mace continued. 'Also – what’s democracy to terrorists who want to kill all Jews and Christians. Move to Gaza since you and your caucus love Hamas so much.' Observers have argued that humanitarian funding for Gaza, including money from the US, often ends up going to the Hamas terrorist group, the most powerful and organized faction in the Palestinian enclave. Many countries, including the US, have paused funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which is responsible for Palestinian refugees and their descendants, for harboring close ties to Hamas terrorists. The Israeli government and research organizations have publicized findings showing numerous UNRWA-employed staff, including teachers and school principals, directly participated in the Oct. 7 attacks. Mace was responding to an April 2024 clip from 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,' in which Ocasio-Cortez accused Israel of inflicting a famine on Gaza as revenge for Oct. 7. The firebrand progressive accused Israel of 'human rights' violations in Gaza and argued that the Jewish state has undermined Palestinian 'civil rights.' Ocasio-Cortez lamented that 'US taxpayer assistance' has helped facilitate what she considers a dereliction of American values. 'It’s not just about Israel. It’s not just about Gaza. This is about us, because this is US taxpayer assistance and what is being financed with our resources, and if any conflict is going to have US resources, then it does become a matter of our values,' Ocasio-Cortez said to Stephen Colbert. She then called on the United States to reaffirm its 'commitment to human rights, to the sanctity of civil rights, to the rules of war' by canceling arms transfers to Israel. Over the past year, Ocasio-Cortez has repeatedly condemned the Jewish state’s response to the Hamas terrorist group’s brutal Oct. 7 slaughter of roughly 1,200 people throughout southern Israel. She has accused the Jewish state of committing a 'genocide' and 'ethnic cleansing' in Gaza, arguing that the conflict has been 'generationally radicalizing' for young Americans. She has also boasted of leading a 'whip operation' to garner votes from fellow Democrats to block aid to Israel. Since entering Congress in 2021, Mace has often defended Israel. Earlier this week, Mace repudiated Palestinian American supermodel Bella Hadid for holding a map that depicts the elimination of Israel. In May 2024, Mace defended Israel’s military conduct in Gaza as 'biblical warfare,' and she has slammed her Democratic colleagues for not being more outspoken about the widespread rapes of Israeli women during the Hamas-led Oct. 7 rampage. 'I can’t think of anything more shameful than to see these women’s groups, to see women on the left, women in the House, my colleagues on the left who refuse to say what this is, which is shameful. It’s disgusting. It’s barbaric,' she said. 'And we ought to be condemning it from every corner of our country. Every woman should be condemning this. And I think it’s shameful.' The post US Rep.

Tanks seen in Jenin area for first time in over 20 years as Israe...	Since January 19, Israeli forces have arrested more than 200 terror suspects, eliminated 71 others who were deemed security threats, and confiscated more than 300 weapons and explosives. By Ehud Amiton, TPS Israeli tanks were seen in the area of Jenin on Sunday as the Israel Defense Forces confirmed it was expanding its counterterror operations in northern Samaria. It marked the first deployment of tanks in Judea and Samaria since 2002. This deployment follows the Thursday night bombings of buses in Bat Yam and Holon. In a rare visit to the Tulkarem refugee camp on Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to escalate the fight. 'In the past year, we have greatly increased our activity,' Netanyahu said as he visited troops and was briefed by commanders. 'We are entering the terrorist strongholds, clearing entire streets used by terrorists, their homes. We are eliminating terrorists and commanders.' Nobody was killed in Thursday night’s bombings. On one bus, a passenger noticed a suspicious unattended bag with wires sticking out and Arabic writing. She alerted the driver who evacuated the vehicle. Three other buses were blown up in separate bus depots while another unexploded bomb was found on another bus. The words, 'Revenge from Tulkarem' were found written in Arabic on one of the bags. An Israeli Jew, a Palestinian, and a third suspect were reportedly arrested on Friday for the attacks on buses. The Israel Defense Forces launched an ongoing counterterror raid in the Jenin refugee camp on Jan. 19. It has since expanded to the Palestinian city Tulkarem and an area of Samaria known as 'the Five Villages.' The raids, dubbed 'Operation Iron Wall,' come on the heels of the Palestinian Authority’s failed crackdown in the Jenin refugee camp. Troops have arrested around 200 terror suspects, seized weapons and explosives, and uncovered a bomb-making laboratory. Since January 19, Israeli forces have arrested more than 200 terror suspects, eliminated 71 others who were deemed security threats, and confiscated more than 300 weapons and explosives. In Jenin, a suspect was apprehended after being caught handling explosive devices. A subsequent search revealed a cache of 20 ready-to-use explosives and a grenade body at a construction site. Since the October 7 attacks, Israeli forces have arrested 6,000 wanted Palestinians in counterterror operations in Judea and Samaria. Around 40 percent were affiliated with Hamas.

IDF strikes Hezbollah targets ahead of Nasrallah’s funeral in Bei...	The IDF on Saturday night struck a Syria-Lebanon border crossing through which Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah was attempting to smuggle weapons, according to the Israeli military. By JNS The Israeli military on Sunday struck a Hezbollah site in Lebanon, targeting rocket launchers and weapons. Several rocket launchers in Southern Lebanon which posed an imminent threat to Israeli civilians were also neutralized, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The military stated that Hezbollah’s continued actions violate established understandings between Jerusalem and Beirut and endanger the State of Israel and its citizens. The IDF emphasized that it remains committed to eliminating any threats against Israel. The operation came just hours before Hezbollah prepares to bury its former leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh. According to Israel’s Channel 12 News, Israeli drones were reportedly observed flying over the Lebanese capital as preparations for the funeral intensified. Nasrallah, who led the Iranian terror proxy for over three decades, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Sept. 27. The funeral ceremony is scheduled to take place in the afternoon at Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium, Lebanon’s largest sports arena, with tens of thousands expected to attend. IDF strikes Hezbollah smuggling routes on Lebanon-Syria border The IDF on Saturday night struck a Syria-Lebanon border crossing through which Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah was attempting to smuggle weapons, according to the Israeli military. The IDF called these attempts a 'blatant violation' of the ceasefire between Jerusalem and Beirut and vowed to 'prevent any attempt by the Hezbollah terrorist organization to rebuild its forces.' Saturday’s strike came after the Israeli Air Force overnight Thursday attacked several border crossings it said were being used by Hezbollah to smuggle in weapons. A day earlier, an Israeli drone strike on a vehicle in Ayta al-Shaab in Southern Lebanon killed an armed Hezbollah terrorist, according to the IDF. That strike in turn came a day after the deadline for a full Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory under the U.S.-brokered Israel-Lebanon ceasefire went into effect on Nov. 27. Last Monday, the IDF confirmed that troops would remain deployed at five strategic outposts in Southern Lebanon, citing the Lebanese Armed Forces’ failure to fully deploy in the area in place of Hezbollah, as required by the terms of the truce. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz on Tuesday vowed to continue to act against Hezbollah 'at full strength.' 'We will not allow a return to the reality of Oct. 7,' he declared, referring to the 2023 Hamas-led massacre in Israel’s south.

Following murder of child hostages, Argentina mulls renaming Pale...	Argentina's capital city to consider measure which would rename Buenos Aires' State of Palestine Street after the Argentinian-Israeli children murdered while in captivity in the Gaza Strip. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Argentina's capital city is considering renaming a street after victims of the Hamas terror organization who were killed while in captivity in the Gaza Strip. Last week, Yamil Santoro, a city councillor in Buenos Aires, drafted a measure which would, if passed, rename the 'State of Palestine Street,' (Estado de Palestina) changing it to 'Bibas Family Street,' (Familia Bibas), in honor of the three members of the Argentinian-Israeli family who were murdered by Hamas terrorists while in captivity in the Gaza Strip. On Thursday, Hamas returned the remains of the two sons of Yarden and Shiri Bibas - Kfir and Ariel - the two youngest hostages abducted from Israel on October 7th. After falsely presenting the remains of another woman as the body of their mother, Shiri, Hamas returned Shiri Bibas' remains over the weekend. While Yarden, a dual Israeli-Argentinian national, was returned alive to Israel earlier this month, his wife and children - who received Argentinian citizenship through their father - were apparently killed in November 2023. Israeli forensics examiners say it appears the two Bibas children were murdered by terrorists who used their bare hands, refuting Hamas' claims they were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Mrs. Bibas' remains also showed no signs her injuries were caused by an airstrike. 'We are introducing a bill to change the name of the street from 'Palestine' to 'Bibas Family,'' Santoro announced last Thursday. 'It is essential to remember and honor the victims of terrorism.' 'Without prejudice to this idea/proposal, if you believe there is another initiative we can promote from the Buenos Aires Legislature to honor the victims and combat terrorism, I would like to hear it.' The street in question, located in Buenos Aires' Almagro neighborhood, was renamed 'State of Palestine Street' in December 2013, after previously being simply called 'Palestine Street,' a symbolic gesture of recognition of unilateral Palestinian statehood. 'State of Palestine, understood as the government that was established to look after its interests, was co-opted by the terrorist group Hamas and has led to us being faced with a failed state that prioritizes the search for the extermination of its neighbors,' Santoro said. 'Recognizing a failed state, appropriated by terrorism, is a deliberate act of forgetting and omitting the atrocities committed.' In addition to political opposition, the measure will face technical hurdles, owing to a 1998 law which prohibits naming public areas after people who have been dead for less than 10 years. Santoro hopes that by naming the street after the Bibas family, rather than individual members of the family, his measure can skirt the restriction. Buenos Aires is not the only city in Argentina, or even in the State of Buenos Aires, with a street named 'Palestine.' In November 2022, Santa Clara del Mar, a municipality in the State of Buenos Aires, renamed a main road 'Palestine Street' in recognition of the 34th anniversary of the Palestine Liberation Organization's declaration of statehood in November 1988.

Hostage was ‘broken by Hamas,’ says father	Hisham al-Sayed, a hostage of Hamas for almost a decade, 'does not communicate' and is in 'a very bad state,' said his father. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Hisham al-Sayed, who was released Saturday after being a prisoner of Hamas for two months short of a decade, was broken by Hamas and is in poor mental condition, his father told Hebrew-language media Saturday. Al-Sayed, who had reportedly been diagnosed with schizophrenia and a personality disorder in his youth and was institutionalized several times, was not forced to participate in a humiliating release ceremony. He was simply brought to a Red Cross vehicle in Gaza City which then drove him over to IDF forces who took him to Ichilov Hospital to be examined and meet his family. A Hamas official told Al-Jazeera that this was done out of 'respect for his family and the Arabs of Israel,' and because he has Palestinian roots,' but the family rejected the statement out of hand. 'He was in a torture camp,' Al-Sayed’s father Shaaban told Ynet. 'They didn't want people to see what condition he was in, so there was no ceremony.' 'Hamas are liars,' he added. 'If they had any respect for people, they would have released him a long time ago&#8230;. As a Muslim, I am furious with Hamas.' Speculating that his son had been isolated while in captivity, Shaaban said his son returned 'broken and is in a very bad state. He almost doesn’t speak, and if he does, it’s only in a whisper, and he lowers his head.' In an interview with Channel 12, he excoriated Hamas again. Hisham 'is not well, he was not in our world. A kind of Tarzan after living for 10 years with animals. He does not communicate,' he said. 'He tries to talk and to share, but he doesn’t succeed,' the father added. 'He says a lot of incomprehensible things. He speaks in a whisper, maybe out of fear. I believe he is in a state of mental torture.' In videos released of his family greeting him in the hospital, al-Sayed can be seen with a completely expressionless face, being hugged briefly by one person after another. A few members said he should have been freed together with the other hostages. 'There should be no difference between him and the Jewish hostages. It makes us feel like he is better than them but for us each of the hostages is important, regardless of his faith,' they said. Jewish Ethiopian-Israeli Avera Mengistu, who also suffered from mental problems and had wandered into Gaza in 2014, was freed in a ceremony in Rafah along with Tal Shoham, a resident of Kibbutz Be’eri whom Hamas had abducted on October 7, 2023, along with 250 others during their invasion of southern Israel. Hisham had attempted to get into Gaza several times before 2015 during long walks he took alone. He often went where he shouldn’t, according to an earlier statement by his father to Human Rights Watch. 'He likes the attention when he goes places he knows are forbidden,' Shaaban said, noting that he had also twice crossed illegally into Jordan, and had even once succeeded in entering the Gaza Strip. 'In 2010, he went to Gaza too, and the Bedouins we know there helped return him within 24 hours,' he said. 'But the Hamas leadership changed in 2014 and his luck ran out.'

Netanyahu rejected plan to assassinate Hamas chief days before Oc...	Israeli prime minister denies report that top security official lobbied Netanyahu to approve plan to assassinate Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas forces in Gaza, less than a week before the October 7th invasion. By World Israel News Staff A top Israeli security official presented Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a plan to assassinate the senior Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip just days before the October 7th, 2023 invasion, a report by Israel's Channel 12 claims. According to the report Saturday night, on October 1st, 2023, Ronen Bar, chief of the Shin Bet internal security agency, lobbied Netanyahu to approve the targeted assassination of Yahya Sinwar, the de facto ruler of the Gaza Strip and mastermind of the invasion of Israel, launched just six days after the plan was reportedly proposed to Netanyahu. Netanyahu is said to have ignored Bar's request to green light the targeted killing. Channel 12 claimed that Saturday's report was based on material collected by the Shin Bet from its own probe into the security failures ahead of and during the October 7th invasion. Among other things, the probe reportedly found that the Shin Bet underestimated the capabilities of Hamas' elite Nukhba Force, which spearheaded the October 7th invasion. As such, the agency did not address warnings of an impending invasion. However, the report states that despite the agency's failure to properly assess the threat posed by the Nukhba Force in the days and hours leading up to the invasion, successive heads of the Shin Bet are said to have warned of Hamas' growing military capabilities and urged the government to carry out targeted killings of senior Hamas officials in Gaza, including Sinwar and Muhammed Deif, chief of Hamas' military wing. Since September of 2023, according the report, the Shin Bet deliberated on steps to increase overall security readiness vis-a-vis a possible campaign in Gaza. On October 1st, during an operational meeting with senior security officials, Bar reportedly advised Netanyahu to okay the Shin Bet's plan to assassinate Sinwar. The Prime Minister's Office, however, vociferously denied the claim, which it denounced as a 'complete lie.' 'The truth is the exact opposite. On the 1st of October 2023, Prime Minister Netanyahu held a situational assessment on the subject of Gaza, during which the Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar recommended that [Israel] grant Hamas benefits to [Gaza] civilians in exchange for quiet.' 'Bar even said that targeted killings should be avoided in the Gaza Strip and in Lebanon, in order to prevent another round of [fighting] in Gaza.' The PMO added that two days later, on October 3rd, Bar argued that Hamas was working to avoid a conflict with Israel, claiming that it was possible to maintain long-term stability between Israel and Gaza. Saturday night's report and the PMO's response come amid reports Netanyahu is planning to replace Bar as Shin Bet chief - a claim the PMO has denied. Critics of the prime minister have linked his alleged plan to fire Bar after the Shin Bet completes its ongoing probe of the October 7th security failures to the agency's investigation into ties between several Netanyahu aides in the Prime Minister's Office and the Qatari government. According to recent reports, several public relations officials from the PMO were paid by Doha to improve Qatar's image in Israel.

Trump: ‘Disgraceful’ how Hamas is treating Israeli hostages	President Trump laments poor condition of Israeli hostages returned from the Gaza Strip, blames Biden for October 7th invasion and failure to bring back the hostages. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump castigated the Hamas terror organization over the weekend, citing its abuse of Israeli hostages held in captivity in the Gaza Strip. Speaking with reporters briefly before departing the White House Saturday for an appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland, the president lamented that the six Israeli hostages returned to Israel from the Gaza Strip earlier in the day appeared to be 'not in great shape.' 'We had a lot of news over the last 24 hours. We had the hostages given back today, it’s disgraceful what’s going on there,' Trump said. 'They’re not in great shape, but we’ve also seen them in worse shape. What a terrible situation it is.' Later that day, during his CPAC address, Trump blamed his predecessor for the October 7th invasion, reiterating previous claims that the Biden White House's softening of economic measures against Iran, including the unfreezing of Iranian assets and sanctions waivers, had enabled Tehran to fund proxy groups including Hamas and Hezbollah. 'October 7th - Israel - would have never happened if I was president. It would have never happened. Iran was broke. They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah. They had no money to give. Everybody knows that. Jewish people in the audience know that. Iran was broke. They were not giving money around.' 'When I got out [of office], [the Biden administration] took all the sanctions off, and Iran became rich very quickly. With oil, you can become rich very, very quickly. And the rest is history. What a horrible thing.' Trump also accused Biden of failing to secure the release of any hostages taken on October 7th, 2023. 'Even though the hostages are coming back, I saw this morning that we got six more back. Biden got none, by the way&#8230;none, zero. He would have never gotten any of them back.' 'But they're coming back in pretty bad shape. It's a horrible thing. And many are dead. Many are dead. So we'll see how that all ends up. But I just want you to know we're working on that.' In November 2023, Hamas released 105 hostages - including 81 Israeli nationals - as part of a ceasefire deal brokered by Qatar, Egypt, and the Biden administration.

Prisoner releases indefinitely halted until hostage ceremonies st...	600 Palestinian prisoners waited on buses for hours, before being told their release was delayed and they needed to return to their cells. By World Israel News Staff Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indefinitely delayed the release of Palestinian prisoners, including those who were expected to be released Saturday following the return of six living Israeli hostages, according to a government statement. On Saturday, Hamas held two separate ceremonies in which they paraded five frail Israeli hostages in front of cheering crowds, ahead of their transfer to the Red Cross. During one of the ceremonies, Omer Shem Tov, who was kidnapped from the Nova Music Festival, was forced to kiss his captor on the forehead. 'In light of the repeated violations by Hamas — including the ceremonies that demean our hostages’ dignity and the cynical use of our hostages for propaganda purposes — it has been decided to delay the release of terrorists planned for yesterday until the next release of hostages is guaranteed, and without the humiliating ceremonies,' read a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, which was released at 1 a.m. on Sunday. Notably, the sole non-Jewish captive freed on Saturday - Hisham a-Sayyid, a Bedouin Muslim-Israeli held by Hamas for more than a decade - was privately handed over to the Red Cross without a public ceremony. The Hamas terror group said in a statement that it transferred a-Sayyid without fanfare 'out of respect for his honor and the honor of Arab-Israelis.' According to Hebrew-language media reports, some 600 Palestinian prisoners had already been boarded onto buses at Ofer Prison Saturday when the announcement came that their release was indefinitely postponed. After waiting for hours on the buses, they were instructed to disembark and return to their cells. Beyond the ceremony held on Saturday, Israel's delay is likely influenced by the botched return of the Bibas' families bodies. On Thursday, Hamas claimed that it transferred the bodies of Shiri Bibas and her sons, Kfir and Ariel, to the Red Cross, along with the body of octogenarian hostage Oded Lifshitz. While DNA testing confirmed the identities of Lifshitz and the Bibas children, the remains of the adult woman were found to not be of Shiri Bibas. Late Friday evening, Hamas returned Shiri Bibas' body. Forensic analysis determined that the Bibas family were brutally murdered by their terrorist captors. Defense Minister Israel Katz said that their murders will 'not be taken lightly.'

Forensic evidence confirms Shiri Bibas not killed by IDF airstrik...	Our examination found no injuries consistent with a bombing,' says IDF. By JNS A forensic analysis of Shiri Bibas’s body found no evidence linking her death to an Israeli airstrike, contrary to claims made by Hamas. Her corpse was positively identified by Dr. Chen Kugel, director of the National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Abu Kabir) in Tel Aviv. 'We identified Shiri Bibas two days after confirming the identities of her two young children, Kfir and Ariel,' Kugel stated on Saturday. 'Our examination found no injuries consistent with a bombing.' Hamas had long alleged that Bibas and her children were killed in an IDF airstrike in Gaza. However, the forensic findings directly contradict that narrative. 'We were met with depths of evil and malice that could not be conceived,' added Kugel. On Thursday, Hamas returned the bodies of Shiri’s children, Kfir and Ariel, along with that of octogenarian Oded Lifshitz. However, the fourth body freed from Gaza, which Hamas said was that of Shiri Bibis, was found to belong to an unidentified woman. Shiri Bibas’s remains were returned to Israel from Gaza on Friday night. Hamas transferred her body to the Red Cross, which then handed it over to the IDF. The military brought her remains to the National Institute of Forensic Medicine for definitive identification and examination. 'This is a difficult day for us and for all citizens of Israel,' Kugel concluded. Forensic analysis of Kfir and Ariel also showed that they were murdered in cold blood by their Gaza captors. The IDF said that the Palestinian terrorists committed the crime 'with their bare hands' weeks after being taken captive on Oct. 7, 2023. On Oct. 7, 2023, Gazan terrorists stormed Kibbutz Nir Oz. They breached the Bibas family home’s door using a drill and other equipment and entered the safe room where the four were hiding. Father Yarden reported the attack to his wider family in real-time, texting that 'it feels like the end.' The video of Shiri’s kidnapping—terrified and trying to protect her two children with her arms as she was surrounded by masked men with weapons—became a symbol of the Oct. 7 massacre. Shiri’s parents, Yossi and Margit Silberman, were murdered that day. Yarden Bibas was freed on Feb. 1 after 484 days in Hamas captivity. According to the Israeli government, 63 hostages are remaining in Gaza, with 36 classified as deceased and 27 alive. Another four bodies are slated for release this coming Thursday.

Who are the 4 deceased hostages being released Thursday?	The bodies of Ohad Yahalomi, Tsahi Idan, Itzik Elgarat, and Shlomo Mantzur are expected to return to Israel this Thursday. By World Israel News Staff The bodies of four deceased Israeli hostages are expected to be returned to Israel this Thursday, marking the final exchange of the first phase of the ongoing hostage deal. Ohad Yahalomi, 49, Tsahi Idan, 49, Itzik Elgarat, 68, and Shlomo Mantzur, 85, were all kidnapped from their homes in southern Israel on October 7th, 2023. While all of the men are now believed to be dead, at least two of them are believed to have been abducted alive. Yahalomi engaged in a gun battle with Hamas terrorists, sitting outside of his home's safe room in Kibbutz Nir Oz, in order to protect his family. He was shot in the leg by terrorists. His wife and two of his children were able to escape, while his 12-year-old son, Eitan, was captured by terrorists. Eitan Yahalomi was released in a December 2023 hostage deal, but his father remained in the Strip. The Yahalomi family has insisted that the wounds Ohad sustained were survivable. Idan was not injured during his abduction from Kibbutz Nahal Oz, indicating that he was murdered in captivity. According to eyewitness testimony from Idan's wife, the father-of-three was kidnapped alive. Terrorists had stormed their home, firing through their safe room door and killing 18-year-old Ma'ayan Idan, who died in her father's arms. Gali Idan managed to protect her other two children, but the terrorists abducted her husband. Elgarat, who holds both Israeli and Danish citizenship, had called his brother from the safe room of his home on October 7th. Danny Elgarat told Hebrew-language media that Itzik was 'hysterical' and had been wounded in the arm by gunfire. The last thing he told his brother was 'this is the end.' Mantzur immigrated from Iraq to Israel as a teenager. He was married to his wife Mazel, who escaped the onslaught physically unharmed, for more than 60 years. The IDF recently said that Mantzur was murdered by terrorists on October 7th at his home in Kibbutz Kissufim, and that his body was abducted to the Gaza Strip. Mantzur's family had previously believed that he was kidnapped alive and had hoped for his safe return.

Freed hostage threatened Hamas captor who sexually abused her	Karina Ariev reportedly told outgoing IDF Chief of Staff that she was severely beaten, strangled during abduction to Gaza. By World Israel News Staff A female observation soldier who was kidnapped from her army base by Hamas terrorists and held in the Gaza Strip for 13 months revealed that she was sexually harassed by one of her captors, according to a Saturday evening report from Channel 12 News. Karina Ariev, 20, was abducted from Nahal Oz alongside Agam Berger, Daniella Gilboa, Liri Albag, and Naama Levy. Nearly all of the other soldiers on the base were killed in the Hamas onslaught. The five women were freed in late January and early February, during phase one of the ongoing ceasefire and hostage exchange deal. While Ariev has not yet spoken directly to the media, Channel 12 News reported new details about October 7th and her time in captivity. The report is based on a conversation that Ariev had with outgoing Chief of Staff Herzi HaLevi. One of the terrorists repeatedly sexually harassed Ariev, though details about his behavior were not included in the report. Ariev said she threatened to tell his commander about his actions, and the harassment stopped, according to Channel 12 News. The Jerusalem-born soldier said she had initially played dead during the Hamas invasion of the base, hiding amid a pile of dead bodies. Meanwhile, terrorists fired additional shots into dead soldiers' bodies, in order to confirm they had killed them. A terrorist noticed that Ariev was still alive and pulled her aside. If he hadn't seen her breathing, Ariev likely would have been shot multiple times. On the way to Gaza, Ariev was severely beaten and strangled nearly to the point of unconsciousness by her abductors. They also stole her jewelry and ripped hair out of her head. At one point Ariev was forced to lie on the hot hood of the terrorists' vehicle, which caused burns to her body. Once in captivity, Ariev endured psychological torture, including threats and insults from the terrorists guarding her.

‘Entering strongholds of terrorism,’ Netanyahu says in Tulkarem	Netanyahu on Thursday ordered the military to conduct a 'massive' counter-terrorism operation in Judea and Samaria following the failed bus bombings in Tel Aviv. By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a visit to the Tulkarem refugee camp in Samaria on Friday—hours after explosions on several buses in the Tel Aviv area that are being investigated as a coordinated terror attack—that Israeli troops 'are doing a tremendous job.' 'In the past year, we have greatly increased our activity. We are entering the strongholds of terrorism, leveling entire streets used by terrorists and their homes, as well as eliminating terrorists and commanders,' Netanyahu said, per an English translation his office provided. 'We are taking extremely important measures against Hamas and other terrorist entities who are attempting to harm us.' The Israeli premier called the events of Thursday night 'an attempt to perpetrate a series of terrorist attacks with mass casualties' that 'is a very severe situation.' In response, he said, Israel is launching 'additional operations against hotbeds of terrorism.' 'I know that our heroic soldiers know how to do this job well,' Netanyahu said. Netanyahu on Thursday ordered the military to conduct a 'massive' counter-terrorism operation in Judea and Samaria and instructed the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) and Israel Police to step up 'preventive activities' against possible additional attacks across the country. Following a situational assessment on Thursday, the IDF said its operations in Judea and Samaria were ongoing and announced the deployment of three additional battalions to reinforce security in the territories. All of the explosions on Thursday occurred in parked, empty buses across the central cities of Bat Yam and Holon, located south of Tel Aviv. There were no injuries in the attack. At least one of the bombs bore a note, in Arabic and Hebrew, that stated, 'Revenge from the Tulkarem refugee camp,' Channel 12 News reported. Five explosive devices, all with timers set to go off simultaneously, were found in what was intended to be a 'strategic terrorist attack,' Channel 12 cited security sources as saying. On Friday, Defense Minister Israel Katz toured the Tulkarem camp, where he vowed to vanquish the terrorists. 'We are at war with extremist Islamic terror and we will win—here, in Gaza and everywhere,' he said. The IDF said on Friday that troops detained some 90 terror suspects in Judea and Samaria over the past week. The military has been conducting an offensive in Samaria, dubbed 'Operation Iron Wall,' since January 21.

Trump: Israel’s decision on Gaza ‘rough,’ fine with war or truce	The president was also asked about his resettlement plan for Palestinians in Gaza in places like Egypt and Jordan, to which he replied that he is not going to force the issue. By JNS It is for Israel to decide whether to resume the war in Gaza or continue into the second round of talks with Hamas to free more hostages, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday. Asked by Brian Kilmeade on Fox News whether he was 'okay either way,' Trump answered, 'I am.' Hamas is 'so violent and vicious,' the president continued, 'it’s a decision that has to be made; it’s a rough decision. One group [of hostages] came in so bad, it looked like [they came out of] a concentration camp in Germany,' Trump said in reference to Eli Sharabi, Or Levy, and Ohad Ben Ami, the three Israeli men who were freed from Gazan captivity on Feb. 8 in emaciated and frail condition. Trump went on to say that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is 'actually not torn. I mean, you know where he stands, and he would like to go in, and he’s just so angry, and he should be. If he’s not angry, then there’d be something wrong with him, frankly. He is very angry; he’s a very angry man at what happened, especially what happened yesterday with these kids …, they were babies,' the president said, referring to the return of the bodies of children Ariel and Kfir Bibas who were kidnapped into Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023. 'It looked like [the Gazans] were celebrating as they were bringing the bodies back. You know, to see it is not even believable. … when you see what’s happening … It’s so barbaric. You wouldn’t think that would happen in the modern age, but it happened,' Trump added. The president was also asked about his resettlement plan for Palestinians in Gaza in places like Egypt and Jordan, to which he replied that he is not going to force the issue. 'Well, we pay Jordan and Egypt billions of dollars a year and I was a little surprised they [rejected the proposal], but they did. And I’ll tell you, the way to do it is my plan. I think that’s the plan that really works,' Trump said. 'But I’m not forcing it,' he added. 'I’m just gonna sit back and recommend it, and then the U.S. would own the site and there’d be no Hamas, and they’d be developed and then you’d start all over again with a clean plate,' the president said. Trump seemed to raise some doubt over his plan, saying that it 'depends on what happens over the next little while. … The question is, can you wipe [Hamas] all out, you know, they are so interspersed among people and it’s certainly not an easy thing to do. 'But I liked my plan; I thought my plan was good. You get them out, you move them, you build a beautiful community and a permanent community, and you then take the Gaza Strip,' Trump said. 'We’ll see what happens. It’s a great location. I don’t know why Israel ever gave that up [in the 2005 disengagement]. … It’s one of the bad real estate deals.' On Tuesday, Israel’s Channel 12 News reported that Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer will head negotiations for the second phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal. Mossad chief David Barnea led previous rounds. The Israeli outlet reported earlier this month that Barnea would still engage with Qatari and Egyptian mediators under Dermer’s guidance. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar told reporters on Tuesday that Jerusalem had decided to start talks on Phase 2 of the agreement. Terrorists in Gaza still holding 63 hostages, 36 of whom have been confirmed dead.

IDF: Hamas murdered Ariel and Kfir Bibas with their bare hands	Hamas then mutilated their bodies to support the claim that they were killed in an air strike and conceal the despicable crime. By Kostis Konstantinou, TPS Ariel and Kfir Bibas, the two toddlers abducted by Hamas terrorists on October 7 were not killed by an Israeli air strike. They were murdered in a brutal manner, according to a televised statement delivered by IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari today. Citing forensic evidence from the children’s remains combined with intelligence reports, Hagari said that the captors of Ariel and Kfir (aged 4 years and 10 months respectively at the time of their abduction) 'brutally murdered them with their bare hands'. He added that they then mutilated their bodies to support the claim that they were killed in an air strike and conceal the despicable crime, treating two helpless infants 'the way ISIS' has done in the past. Hagari added that the IDF has shared this intelligence with international partners. The IDF Spokesperson also disclosed that he spoke with the children’s father, the only surviving member of the Bibas family. 'Yarden wants the whole world to know the brutal manner in which his children were murdered,' he explained.

Israel redeems six hostages from Hamas captivity in Gaza	Hamas is slated to return four additional bodies to Israel next Thursday, in what would be the final exchange of Phase 1 of the ceasefire agreement that took effect on Jan. 19 and is due to end on March 1. By Charles Bybelezer, JNS Israel on Saturday redeemed six living hostages from Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip: Eliya Cohen, 27, Avera Mengistu, 39, Hisham al-Sayed, 36, Omer Shem Tov, 22, Tal Shoham, 40, and Omer Wenkert, 23. Cohen, Shem Tov, Shoham and Wenkert were all abducted during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, massacre, while Mengistu and al-Sayed suffer from mental illness and crossed into the Strip over a decade ago. Hamas released Mengistu and Shoham during a propaganda ceremony in southern Gaza’s Rafah, while Cohen, Shem Tov and Wenkert were freed in a similar exchange in Nuseirat in the Palestinian enclave’s center. Al-Sayed was handed over in Gaza City. Shoham’s family released a statement hailing the 'unforgettable moment,' while urging the government to do everything in its power to bring home the remaining captives. 'We thank all the people of Israel who stood with us through all the long days of pain and suffering. During these days, we need privacy for Tal, Adi, and the children,' said the statement. 'At this crucial moment in our lives, our only request is to seize this window of opportunity to secure a deal that will bring fathers back to their children—children need their fathers—and return all hostages home: the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for eternal rest.' Added Mengistu’s relatives: 'Our family has endured 10 years and five months of unimaginable suffering. During this time, there have been continuous efforts to secure his return, with prayers and pleas, some silent, that remained unanswered until today. … We ask that these moments be respected, and that we be granted the peace and rest we so desperately need.' The hostages were all handed over to Red Cross representatives and driven to meetings point in Gaza, where they were transferred to Israeli special forces. The captives were then taken back to Israel, where they underwent a preliminary physical and psychological examination at an army facility near Kibbutz Re’im, located close to the border, and to meet with their families. 'The commanders and soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces salute and embrace the returning hostages as they make their way home to the State of Israel,' said the military in a statement. Cohen’s family said in a statement on Saturday, 'We are overwhelmed with emotion and gratitude for Eliya’s return home after 505 long and torturous days in captivity. … 'We want to thank the IDF soldiers, the fighters, the Hostages Families Forum, our family liaison officer Amit, and especially all citizens of Israel for their embrace, support, and unwavering faith. Many prayers were answered today, and we thank everyone who accompanied us on this long journey,' added the statement. Shem Tov’s family noted he survived captivity despite suffering from celiac disease and has become 'a child of the entire State of Israel' since the Oct. 7 invasion and massacre. 'We still don’t know everything—the horror stories will only be revealed with time. But now, we can hug him again,' the family said in a statement. 'Thank you to the Creator, to the people of Israel for their prayers, strength and love. Thank you to the soldiers who sacrificed for this moment, to everyone involved in the negotiations and diplomatic efforts. Thank you to Omer’s family and friends, and ours, who never gave up and never lost hope,' it added. In exchange, Israel was set to release on Saturday 602 Palestinian terrorists, including 50 serving life sentences, 60 serving long terms and 47 re-arrested after the 2011 swap for captive IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. However, Israel informed Palestinian officials in Ramallah that the release would be postponed until 8 p.m. local time. 'Regarding the delay in the release of the terrorists—following the conclusion of [Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s] security consultation, a decision will be made regarding next steps, and the completion of the return of hostages’ remains at this stage,' an unnamed Israeli source was quoted by Hebrew media as saying. Hamas is slated to return four additional bodies to Israel next Thursday, in what would be the final exchange of Phase 1 of the ceasefire agreement that took effect on Jan. 19 and is due to end on March 1. On Friday, Netanyahu eulogized the slain hostages returned the previous day—octogenarian Oded Lifshitz and children Kfir and Ariel Bibas—and vowed to bring home the boys’ mother, Shiri Bibas, from Gaza. 'The cruelty of the Hamas monsters knows no bounds. Not only did they kidnap the father, Yarden Bibas, the young mother, Shiri, and their two small babies. In an unspeakably cynical manner, they did not return Shiri to her little children, the little angels, and they put the body of a Gazan woman in a coffin,' said Netanyahu in a video message to the nation. 'We will work resolutely to bring Shiri home together with all our abductees—both living and dead—and ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement. The sacred memory of Oded Lipshitz and Ariel and Kfir Bibas will be forever enshrined in the heart of the nation. God will avenge their blood,' he continued. Overnight Friday, Hamas returned the body of Shiri Bibas, who was murdered in cold blood in captivity. Yarden Bibas was freed on Feb. 1 after 484 days in Hamas captivity. Terrorists in Gaza are still holding 63 hostages, 36 of whom have been confirmed dead.

Freed hostage Agam Berger found Rabbi Druckman’s book in Gaza, co...	The book, With Strength and With Spirit, which was distributed in Bnei Akiva yeshivas and girls' high schools, was accidentally left behind by an IDF soldier. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Freed hostage and IDF lookout Agam Berger discovered a book by Rabbi Haim Druckman in Gaza and consulted it on whether one can eat non-kosher meat in life-threatening situations. The book, which was distributed in Bnei Akiva yeshivas and girls' high schools, was accidentally left behind by an IDF soldier. Berger, who maintained Jewish observance during her captivity, said that upon reading the book, she learned that she was permitted to eat non-kosher meat if her life was in danger. Elhanan Glatt, CEO of the Bnei Akiva Yeshivot and Ulpanot Center, said, 'Rabbi Druckman, your efforts are rewarded, and they have returned from enemy territory. We aimed to instill the spirit and light of Rabbi Druckman in the soldiers just before the ground operation began.' Yaniv Sufan, director of the 'Hinenu' initiative continuing Rabbi Druckman’s legacy, said, 'It is deeply moving that the booklets from Rabbi Druckman, of blessed memory, reached the soldiers who needed them most—the lookouts.' 'There is no better representation of the booklet's title, With Strength and With Spirit,'than Agam’s spirit of greatness, which has become evident since her return.' Liri Albag reported that Agam Berger stayed true to her religious observance during her captivity, including keeping kosher and observing Shabbat. 'Despite the difficult conditions and limited food options, Agam chose to remain faithful to her values and her faith,' Liri said. Liri’s mother, Merav, shared that her daughter refused to eat any non-kosher food offered to her during captivity, despite the severe food shortages. Before her daughter’s release, Merav Berger requested that if Agam were released on Saturday, those involved, as well as the media, avoid violating Shabbat. 'I will wait for Agam, with G-d’s help, when she comes, with as little desecration of Shabbat as possible,' she said. 'I ask of you, those who embrace us and have journeyed with us, and who have the great merit of bringing our children home—please do not desecrate Shabbat.' In addition to Berger, other released hostages reported refusing leavened food during Passover and fasting on Yom Kippur, despite suffering severe malnutrition.

US envoy warns Hamas to release all hostages ‘or face total annih...	Boehler: 'It’s not just that you need to release her (Shiri Bibas's) body; you must free all of the remaining hostages.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News US envoy for hostages Adam Boehler had harsh words for Hamas after they returned an anonymous corpse to Israel instead of the body of Shiri Bibas. Boehler described Hamas’s action as 'a clear violation' and offered this piece of advice: 'It’s not just that you need to release her body; you must free all of the remaining hostages.' He pointed out that Hamas is still holding Idan Alexander, an Israeli-American, and stated, 'Idan needs to come home.' 'If I were them, I’d release everyone, or they will face total annihilation,' he added. On Thursday, Hamas held a ceremony for cheering crowds in Gaza, claiming the bodies in the coffins belonged to hostages Kfir Bibas, Ariel Bibas, Shiri Bibas, and Oded Lifshitz. However, upon examination by a forensics team, it was revealed that the body they said was Shiri Bibas’s was actually that of an anonymous woman, not a hostage. Additionally, Hamas falsely claimed that the Bibas family members were killed by Israeli airstrikes. Forensic experts determined that the Bibas children had been murdered. Yarden Bibas, their father, was released from Hamas captivity last week. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his condolences in a Hebrew-language video statement: 'The State of Israel bows its head over the loss of two small children, tender infants, brothers—Ariel and Kfir Bibas, may their memory be a blessing—and over Oded Lifshitz, may his memory be a blessing, one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz.' 'All three were brutally murdered in Hamas captivity during the first weeks of the war. The cruelty of Hamas knows no bounds.' Netanyahu continued, 'Not only did they abduct the father, Yarden Bibas, the young mother, Shiri, and their two little babies, but in an act of unimaginable cynicism, they did not return Shiri to her small children. Instead, they placed the body of a Gazan woman in the coffin.' He pledged that Hamas would pay 'the full price' for violating the ceasefire and hostage deal with Israel. 'We will act with determination to bring Shiri home, along with all our captives—both the living and the fallen—and we will ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and vicious breach of the agreement.'

Israel accuses Turkey of helping Iran funnel funds to Hezbollah	Israel’s Channel 14 reported on Tuesday that it is believed that tens of millions of dollars have already reached Hezbollah through Turkey. By JNS Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar on Monday accused Turkey of assisting Iran in funneling funds to Hezbollah in Lebanon. During a meeting at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem with a bipartisan delegation of U.S. senators, which included seven senators and Deputy Middle East Special Envoy Morgan Ortagus, Sa’ar warned that Iran has intensified its efforts to finance Hezbollah, with the active involvement of Turkey.

A senior political source told Channel 14 reporter Tamir Morag: 'Turkey sees itself as the leader of the Sunni world, and as such, it plays a ‘big players’ game against Shi’ite Iran.

RFK Jr. orders sweeping review of vaccines and antidepressants	Kennedy listed several other things as possible causes of chronic diseases such as radiation from electronic devices, farming chemicals, processed foods, food allergies, tiny plastic particles in the environment, and chemicals used to make non-stick pans. By Jewish Breaking News A month ago, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sat before a Senate hearing committee and declared, 'I support vaccines. I support the vaccine schedule. I support good science.' But this week, Kennedy struck a markedly different tone. His first act as Health Secretary was to announce an investigation whether childhood vaccinations might be linked to chronic diseases. 'We will convene representatives of all viewpoints to study the causes for the drastic rise in chronic disease,' Kennedy told the assembled workers at HHS headquarters on Tuesday. 'Some of the possible factors we will investigate were formerly taboo or insufficiently scrutinized.' Kennedy made it clear he planned to redirect the agency’s vast resources toward questioning long-established medical consensus, noting that 'nothing is going to be off limits.' His investigation plans go beyond just vaccines and antidepressants. Kennedy listed several other things as possible causes of chronic diseases such as radiation from electronic devices, farming chemicals, processed foods, food allergies, tiny plastic particles in the environment, and chemicals used to make non-stick pans. 'Whatever belief or suspicion I have expressed in the past, I’m willing to subject them all to the scrutiny of unbiased science,' he said. 'That is going to be our template — unbiased science. That’s something that will make us all proud of this agency and of our role in restoring American health.' However, public health experts warn there’s a big difference between studying new environmental threats and re-examining vaccines that we already know are safe. 'It’s very disturbing that someone who has spent so much of his career trying to undermine confidence in vaccines, trying to tear down the infrastructure that approves and recommends vaccines, has the potential to be in a position of power over the infrastructure that has those goals,' infectious disease specialist Adam Ratner tells NPR. 'It is much easier to scare people than to unscare them,' he says. 'And I think that just by elevating anti-vaccine views in the guise of RFK, I think that we risk a crisis in vaccine confidence in the U.S.' The post RFK Jr. orders sweeping review of vaccines and antidepressants appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/rfk-jr-orders-sweeping-review-of-vaccines-and-antidepressants/	2025-02-21T02:59:24-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AP25028838083237.jpg
IAF strikes Hezbollah smuggling routes on Lebanon-Syria border	Defense Minister Israel Katz on Tuesday vowed to continue to act against Hezbollah 'at full strength.' By JNS The Israeli Air Force overnight Thursday attacked crossing points in the area of the Lebanon-Syria border used by Hezbollah to smuggle weapons into the Land of the Cedars. The military noted that the Iranian-backed terrorist group’s attempt to rearm constitutes a blatant violation of ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon. 'The IDF continues to operate to remove any threat to the State of Israel and will operate to prevent any attempt by the Hezbollah terrorist organization to rebuild its forces,' the military said.

The incident came a day after the deadline for a full Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory, under the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Jerusalem and Beirut that went into effect on Nov. 27. On Monday, the IDF confirmed that troops would remain deployed at five strategic outposts in Southern Lebanon because the Lebanese Armed Forces have not fully deployed in the area in place of Hezbollah, as required by the terms of the truce.

‘Hamas will pay the full price’ for murdering Bibas family, withh...	After forensic examinations reveal that the two youngest hostages abducted on October 7th were murdered in captivity, and that Hamas violated deal by withholding mother's remains, Netanyahu vows terror group 'will pay the full price.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu castigated Hamas Friday morning, and warned that Israel would 'seek justice' against the terror organization, after Israeli forensics examiners found that two small children taken hostage were murdered. 'The State of Israel bows its head over the loss of two small children, tender infants, brothers—Ariel and Kfir Bibas, may their memory be a blessing, and over Oded Lifshitz, may his memory be a blessing, one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz,' Netanyahu said in a Hebrew-language video statement. 'All three were brutally murdered in Hamas captivity during the first weeks of the war. The cruelty of the Hamas monsters knows no bounds.' Netanyahu ripped Hamas not only for the murders of the Bibas children - both of whom were, according to the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute, murdered in November 2023 - but also for using their bodies in a propaganda display in Gaza on Thursday. The premier also lambasted the terror group for refusing to return the body of the boys' mother, Shiri Bibas. Hamas claimed it handed over Shiri's remains on Thursday, but examiners at Abu Kabir determined that the body was not that of Mrs. Bibas. 'Not only did they abduct the father, Yarden Bibas, the young mother, Shiri, and their two little babies, but in an act of unimaginable cynicism, they did not return Shiri to her small children, these little angels, and instead placed the body of a Gazan woman in the coffin.' Netanyahu pledged that Hamas would pay 'the full price' for violating the ceasefire and hostage deal with Israel. 'We will act with determination to bring Shiri home, along with all our captives—both the living and the fallen—and we will ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and vicious breach of the agreement.' 'May the sacred memory of Oded Lifshitz, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas be forever enshrined in the heart of the nation. May God avenge their blood. And we, too, will seek justice.' Shiri's husband, Yarden, the father of Kfir and Ariel, was released on February 1st, as part of the ceasefire deal. Israel contends that the substitution of another body for the remains of Shiri Bibas constitutes a violation of the hostage deal. On Friday, Hamas issued a statement admitting that it had not returned Mrs. Bibas' remains. The terror group claimed that Shiri Bibas was killed in an IDF airstrike - despite forensic evidence from the Bibas children that they were not killed as a result of an airstrike. 'Shiri Bibas' remains apparently became mixed with the remains of other dead under the rubble, after the IAF struck the place where she was staying,' Hamas claimed.

By Jewish Breaking News Hezbollah is pulling out all the stops for Sunday’s funeral of its eliminated leader Hassan Nasrallah and his deputy Hashem Safieddine, implementing extraordinary security measures and shutting down much of Beirut for the ceremony. According to AFP, Beirut’s airport will completely shut down from noon until 4:00 PM, with all flights suspended during the ceremony scheduled for 1:00 PM local time at Camille Chamoun sports stadium. After Israel bombed his underground bunker in September, Nasrallah was temporarily buried in an undisclosed location out of fear that Israel might target a large funeral gathering. Now, with an extended ceasefire in place, Hezbollah will be welcoming terrorists from around the world. Iran has promised 'high-level' participation but has notably avoided specifying which officials will attend. Iraqi Airways and Lebanon’s Middle East Airlines have increased flights from Baghdad as representatives of Iraq’s main pro-Iran terrorist factions also prepare to attend. The procession will then move from the stadium to Nasrallah’s burial site near the airport, now lined with Hezbollah flags and images of fallen terror commanders. Safieddine, who was designated to succeed Nasrallah before being eliminated by Israel, will be buried separately on Monday in his southern hometown of Deir Qanun al-Nahr. Hezbollah’s elaborate funeral comes as the Iranian-backed terror group grapples with mounting losses, including hundreds of fighters and senior commanders killed since it joined Hamas’s war against Israel in October 2023. Perhaps their worst day came on September 17 and 18 when 1,500 terrorists were taken out of commission when the Mossad detonated an unspecified number of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies. document.createElement('video'); The post Beirut shuts down for Hezbollah leader’s funeral appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/beirut-shuts-down-for-hezbollah-leaders-funeral/	2025-02-21T01:32:52-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/shutterstock_2342698091-scaled.jpg
Netanyahu orders ‘massive’ counter-terror op after bus bombings	All of the explosions on Thursday occurred in parked, empty buses across the central city of Bat Yam, located just south of Tel Aviv. By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday night ordered the military to conduct a 'massive' counter-terrorism operation in Judea and Samaria, after three buses exploded near Tel Aviv and bombs were found on two others in what is being investigated as a coordinated attack. Netanyahu also instructed the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) and Israel Police to step up 'preventive activities' against possible additional attacks across the country. Following a situational assessment on Thursday, the IDF said its operations in Judea and Samaria were ongoing, and that areas within the territories have been closed off. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi instructed forces to assist the Israel Police as necessary. The military also announced the deployment of three additional battalions to reinforce security in Judea and Samaria, adding that it was 'prepared to expand the offensive operations.'

All of the explosions on Thursday occurred in parked, empty buses across the central city of Bat Yam, located just south of Tel Aviv. There were no injuries in the attack. At least one of the bombs bore a note, in Arabic and Hebrew, that stated, 'Revenge from the Tulkarem refugee camp,' a reference to the terrorist hotbed in Samaria where security forces have been conducting operations, Channel 12 News reported. Five explosive devices, all with timers set to go off simultaneously, were found in what was intended to be a 'strategic terrorist attack,' Channel 12 cited security sources as saying. The Shin Bet was called to the scenes, and all bus drivers in the Tel Aviv metropolitan were instructed to search their vehicles for bombs. Miri Regev, the Israeli transport minister, instructed the National Public Transport Authority to 'stop and inspect all buses, trains and light rail cars and act in accordance with the instructions of the Shin Bet and the police.' Defense Minister Israel Katz directed the IDF to increase 'the intensity of activities to thwart terrorism in the Tulkarm refugee camp and in the refugee camps in Judea and Samaria in general,' following what he called 'attempted serious terrorist attacks. 'We will pursue the terrorists to the bitter end and destroy the terrorist infrastructure in the camps that serve as a frontline for the Iranian axis of evil,' Katz said.

American conservatives vote to back Israeli sovereignty over Jude...	‘Akin to the Balfour Declaration’ - Conservative Political Action Conference, America’s largest annual gathering of political conservatives, votes to endorse Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. By World Israel News Staff American conservative activists voted this week to endorse the application of Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, amid speculation the Netanyahu government may move forward with a long-shelved plan to place Israeli towns in the disputed area under Israeli law. On Wednesday night, the American Conservative Union kicked off its annual gathering, the Conservative Political Action Conference, in Oxon Hill, Maryland, outside of Washington D.C. According to multiple reports in the Israeli media Thursday night, during the conference, activists voted to back a resolution calling for the extension of Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. The resolution was drafted following talks between senior CPAC officials and settlement enterprise leaders, including Israel Ganz, mayor of the Binyamin Regional Council and chairman of the Yesha Council, the umbrella group representing Israeli municipalities in Judea and Samaria, Israel National News reported. The Yesha Council was represented at the conference by the organization’s CEO, Omer Rahamim. The 'CPAC resolution,' Rahamim told The Jerusalem Post, 'carries considerable weight with respect to American support for the extension of Israeli sovereignty to Judea and Samaria.' The Israeli government also sent an envoy to the conference, with Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli (Likud) attending. On Thursday, former Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland read the text of the CPAC resolution. 'We believe all these areas are integral parts of Israel, and the United States of America and her allies should recognize Israeli sovereignty over these lands,' the resolution states regarding Judea and Samaria. In response, Ganz hailed the resolution as a second 'Balfour Declaration,' referring to the 1917 letter by British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour, later adopted by the British government as its official policy, backing the formation of a Jewish national homeland in the historic Land of Israel. 'Your declaration is akin to the Balfour Declaration,' Ganz said. 'You are granting political validity to biblical values and to justice. This is a tremendous blessing for Israel, the U.S, and the entire free world.' 'The extension of sovereignty will launch a new era based on the historic truth that the Land of Israel belongs to the Jewish people and the Jewish state. These days are proof of the depth of the partnership between our countries, both in the processes currently underway, and in the promise for Israel’s hold on Judea and Samaria. The declaration today clarifies the importance of changing the security reality in all the arenas – the north, the south and in Judea and Samaria, to ensure the security of the State of Israel.'

Shiri Bibas still held in Gaza, Bibas children murdered in captiv...	In a chilling display, Hamas paraded the children's bodies in coffins before handing them over to the Red Cross for transfer to Israel. By Joseph Lichtenstadter, World Israel News The IDF has confirmed that the body returned by Hamas is not that of Shiri Bibas, deepening the anguish surrounding the fate of her family. Reports initially suggested that the hostages being transferred were Kfir and Ariel Bibas—the baby and toddler sons of Shiri Bibas—along with a 84-year-old grandfather, Oded Lifshitz. While the IDF has verified the identities of the two children and the elderly Oded, the fourth body remains unidentified. Tragically, the IDF has also confirmed that Hamas terrorists murdered the Bibas brothers after abducting them from their cribs in Nir Oz during the October 7th massacre. In a chilling display, Hamas paraded the children's bodies in coffins before handing them over to the Red Cross for transfer to Israel. The grim stage was adorned with a poster featuring images of the hostages, alongside a grotesque depiction of Prime Minister Netanyahu as a vampire. The coffins were even marked with a 'date of arrest,' as if to erase the innocence of the victims—a young mother, her defenseless children, and an elderly man. As Israel reels from this devastating development, the uncertainty surrounding Shiri Bibas’s fate casts an even darker shadow over the already unbearable grief. The IDF is still assessing the situation, and further updates are expected.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Iris Haim, mother of Yotam Haim, who was mistakenly shot by the IDF after fleeing his captors, compared the deceased Bibas children to her son. 'The red-haired children are similar to Yotam. He was a red-haired child, exactly like them, on Kibbutz Gvulot,' she said in an interview with Channel 14. 'Orange is the color of love, the orange-gold hair of the three hostages – Ariel and Kfir Bibas and Yotam Haim,' she wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday. Kfir and Ariel Bibas, the red-haired children who, along with their mother Shiri, became symbolic of the hostage crisis, were returned in coffins to Israel along with the body of deceased hostage Oded Lifshitz. When Hamas released the names of the four dead hostages, relatives of the Bibas family said they had been holding out hope until the names were confirmed and criticized the press for prematurely eulogizing the Bibas family before Israel had confirmed they had been killed. Haim said, 'Yesterday, the names were published despite the family’s request not to do so. Until yesterday, I had hoped for the Bibas family.' Speaking as a mother who lost a son hostage in Gaza, Haim said, 'You don’t realize it until you see the body, and then you understand. Because I understand the family so well, I would ask that, until the last moment, no one speak about it.' 'This is a major tragedy for the country. People were devastated because they understood that these situations are becoming more complicated&#8230; Now hostages may return, alive or dead.' Haim said the tragedy provides a kind of clarity about 'how much we care for, love, and support each other.'

By World Israel News and JNS Israeli security agencies are investigating three explosions that occurred in parked buses across the central Israeli city of Bat Yam on Thursday night as suspected terrorist attacks. According to reports, the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) was called to the scenes, and bus drivers in the Tel Aviv area have been instructed to search their vehicles for possible explosives. In addition, operations of the Tel Aviv light rail has been grounded, Channel 12 News reported. Israel Police said that multiple explosive devices weighing approximately 5 kilograms each were placed into buses, intending to explode Friday morning, possibly killing hundreds of civilians. There were no injuries as a result of the blasts, the Israel Police stated. Bat Yam Mayor Zvika Brot told local media, 'The incident began at two locations just minutes apart. Two bombs were detonated on two buses that were empty.' He added that while there were no casualties in the suspected terror attacks, 'there are suspicions of an additional bomb.' Shortly after Brot issued his statement, Israeli media outlets aired video footage of what was said to be a third bus explosion in the Bat Yam area.

Under international law, any handover of the remains of the deceased must comply with the prohibition of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, ensuring respect for the dignity of the deceased and their families. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk criticized Hamas for the ceremony it held during the release of the bodies of four hostages. 'Under international law, any handover of the remains of the deceased must comply with the prohibition of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, ensuring respect for the dignity of the deceased and their families,' the rights chief said in a statement. The captives included 85-year-old Oded Lifshitz, 33-year-old Shiri Bibas, and her two sons – the youngest Israelis taken hostage by Gazan terrorists on October 7th – Ariel and Kfir. At an event held by Hamas in the Bani Suheila neighborhood of the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis on Thursday morning, a large crowd cheered as Hamas arrived carrying four black coffins in separate cars. 'As the bodies of four Israeli hostages are transferred by Hamas to the Red Cross, hundreds of ‘innocent Gazans’ dance to music and happily film this tragic event,' Israel’s Government Press Office wrote on X. 'We are at a loss for words to describe how this makes us feel.' Half an hour later, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office announced that the coffins carrying the four slain hostages had been handed over to the IDF. 'Israel has received, through the Red Cross, the coffins of four fallen hostages,' the PMO stated. During the transfer of the bodies, a heated exchange took place between Red Cross officials and Hamas terrorists over the ceremony and the manner in which the transfer was handled. Israel also protested to the mediators and filed a complaint with the Red Cross about the 'ceremony.' 'The pain is indescribable. Our hearts, those of the entire nation, are shattered,' President Isaac Herzog said. 'On behalf of the State of Israel, I lower my head and seek forgiveness. Forgiveness for failing to protect you on that tragic day. Forgiveness for not bringing you home safely. May their memory be a blessing.'

Hamas official says at least 2.3 million people alive in Gaza, un...	Furthermore, Naim denied that the ongoing war is between Israel and the Hamas terrorist group, asserting that the entirety of the Palestinian people is fighting against Israel. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner During an interview with anti-Israel social media personality Jackson Hinkle, a Hamas leader claimed that over 2 million people are still alive in the Gaza Strip, undercutting the notion that a so-called 'genocide' has taken place in the war-torn enclave. Citing recent comments made by US President Donald Trump that roughly 1.7 million people remain in Gaza, Hinkle asked interview guest Basem Naim, a Hamas official and former Gaza Minister of Health, whether he believed that far more people had died in the enclave than originally thought. Naim immediately dismissed the claim, clarifying that over 2 million Palestinians in Gaza are still alive. 'Donald Trump has come out a few times and he says the population in Gaza is 1.7 to 1.8 million. Of course, before [Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel] the population was much more than that, 400,000 to 500,000. Do you think his statistics are accurate, and if so, where did all those people go? Because we see the Ministry of Health in Gaza, they say the [Palestinian] death toll registered officially is over 40,000 [during the Israel-Hamas war],' Hinkle asked. 'I have no idea about his intentions to mention this number. But officially, there are 2.3 million-plus Palestinians are in the Gaza Strip,' Naim said. The senior Hamas official added that around 200,000 Palestinians have fled the Gaza Strip to other areas for safety reasons both before and after the current war. He claimed that many Palestinians left for academic or professional reasons. The terrorist official said that he believes around 50,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israel’s defensive military operations following the Oct. 7 attack and that around 10,000 are missing. Furthermore, Naim denied that the ongoing war is between Israel and the Hamas terrorist group, asserting that the entirety of the Palestinian people is fighting against Israel. 'First of all, this confrontation is not between Hamas and Israel, because this has been said all the time in Western media. It is between Palestinians and Israel. Maybe this time, it is led by Hamas,' he said. Naim stated that Hamas’s 'armed resistance' is a tool the group uses to achieve its 'political goals' of destroying Israel and creating a Palestinian state in its place. He added that the Oct. 7 attacks — in which roughly 1200 people were killed in southern Israel and 250 were abducted as hostages — were a justified response to Israeli aggression. He denied that the brutal and unprovoked slaughter of Israeli civilians was 'initiated from our side.' Hinkle has an extensive history of spreading unsubstantiated and false claims about Israel. Like many anti-Israel critics, he has repeatedly asserted that the Jewish state has committed a 'genocide' in Gaza as revenge for Oct. 7. However, Hinkle has gone further than other anti-Israel commentators, oftentimes lauding the Hamas terrorist group as a 'resistance' organization and celebrating Iran’s April 2024 missile attacks against the Jewish state. Hinkle has referred to the anti-Israel outrage following Oct. 7 as a personal 'godsend,' which allowed his X/Twitter follower count balloon from roughly 400,000 to over 2.3 million in the span of a few months. 'DROP A LIKE if you stand with IRAN in the face of ISRAELI TERRORISM!' Hinkle posted on X/Twitter in April 2024. Beyond his support for Hamas, Hinkle has praised the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has defended the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

Israel bans entry for those denying October 7 massacre or working...	If enacted, the law would criminalize collaboration with the ICC, making it illegal for Israeli citizens, authorities, and public entities to provide services or resources to the court. By Pesach Benson, TPS As Israelis prepared to receive the bodies of four hostages, the Israeli Knesset on Wednesday passed legislation barring non-citizens from entering or residing in the country if they or their affiliated organizations deny the October 7 massacre or the Holocaust, or if they support international prosecution of Israeli security personnel. The legislation, which was approved without opposition, builds on a 2017 amendment that barred providing visas and travel permits to individuals or organizations advocating boycotts of Israel. Proposed by Michel Buskila of the New Hope-United Right party and originally initiated by New Hope MK Zeev Elkin, the law aims to strengthen Israel’s ability to counteract what it described as 'hostile elements' who 'seek to harm the state.' According to the bill’s explanatory notes, existing legal measures were insufficient. The Knesset also advanced another bill targeting cooperation with the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. That proposal, submitted by Likud MK Amit Halevi, passed its preliminary reading with 25 votes in favor and 10 against. If enacted, the law would criminalize collaboration with the ICC, making it illegal for Israeli citizens, authorities, and public entities to provide services or resources to the court. Individuals found guilty of doing so could face up to five years in prison. The bill also seeks to prevent ICC officials and affiliates from entering Israel, owning property, or conducting economic activities in the country without special authorization. Supporters argue that the ICC poses a significant threat to Israel’s sovereignty and security personnel, reinforcing Israel’s longstanding position that it does not recognize the court’s jurisdiction. The International Criminal Court issued unprecedented arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in November, the first time warrants have been issued against leaders from a democratic country. Both officials would be liable for arrest if they travel to countries that are party to the ICC. The court also issued a warrant for Hamas commander Mohammed Deif. Although he was killed in an airstrike in July, Hamas never confirmed Deif’s death. Israel is not a member of the ICC and does not recognize its jurisdiction. The ICC charter prohibits the court from prosecuting nationals of countries with independent judiciaries. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 69 remaining hostages, 36 are believed to be dead.

Israel to free 602 terrorists as part of ceasefire	Of the 602 terrorists to be released this week, 108 are expected to be deported to Egypt before being moved to other countries from there. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Israel is set to commute the sentences of 602 imprisoned terrorists this week as part of the last two releases of the first phase of its ceasefire agreement with Hamas, Hebrew media reported on Thursday. In accordance with the deal, the bodies of four hostages were returned to the Jewish state on Thursday morning. The remains are said to be those of Shiri Bibas (32 when captured on Oct. 7, 2023) and her sons, Ariel (4 when taken) and Kfir (9 months old when taken), as well as of Oded Lifshitz (83 when taken). Six living hostages are scheduled to be released on Saturday. Of the prisoners to be released by Israel this week, 445—residents of the Gaza Strip who were arrested by Israeli forces after the Oct. 7 massacre—are set to be freed later on Thursday. The remaining 157 terrorists are to be released after the six hostages return to Israeli territory on Saturday. This figure includes 50 terrorists who were serving life sentences, 60 with long sentences and 47 who were released in a 2011 deal with Hamas and later rearrested. Of the 602 terrorists to be released this week, 108 are expected to be deported to Egypt before being moved to other countries from there. Among those scheduled for release is Khalil Jabarin, who murdered dual U.S.-Israeli citizen Ari Fuld at Judea’s Gush Etzion Junction in 2018. Another is Omar al-Zaban, a senior operative in Hamas’s 'military wing' serving 27 life sentences plus 25 years for his role in attacks that claimed the lives of at least 27 people. Bilal Abu-Ghanem is serving three life sentences for the 2015 murder of Haviv Haim, 78, Alon Govberg, 51, and Richard Lakin, 76, on bus 78 in Jerusalem’s Armon Hanatziv area. Also to be released is Nael Barghouti, convicted of murdering of Israeli bus driver Mordechai Yekuelin, 27, in January 1978. He was released in the 2011 Shalit deal but rearrested after once again engaging in terrorist activity. Abed el-Nasser Isa—widely considered to be a student of infamous Hamas bomb-maker Yahya Ayyash—is also to be released. In the current first phase of the truce, Hamas has agreed to free 33 hostages, while Israel agreed to commute the sentences of some 2,000 terrorists.

Qatar pretends to be a mediator, the ‘honest broker’ of the Middle East,' Rabbi Pini Dunner, spiritual leader of the Beverly Hills Synagogue stated. By JNS Dozens of Jewish-American activists gathered outside the Los Angeles estate of former Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani on Sunday in protest against Doha’s support for Hamas. The demonstration was led by Rabbi Pini Dunner, spiritual leader of the Beverly Hills Synagogue. Protestors—carrying signs reading, 'A Terrorist Financier Lives Here' and 'HBJ – Go Back to Qatar'—chanted for the return of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre. 'Bin Jassim brought Hamas to Doha and funded them with $30 million monthly in Gaza,' Dunner declared during the rally. 'He is personally responsible for the Oct. 7th massacre. How is it possible that after all this, he lives in a luxurious mansion in Bel Air, Los Angeles?' 'Qatar pretends to be a mediator, the ‘honest broker’ of the Middle East,' the rabbi noted. 'But you know what they really are? They are financiers and supporters of terrorism. All they care about is sowing destruction and chaos in the world and then pretending to solve it.' Hamad bin Jassim (HBJ) of Qatar funneled billions into Hamas, fueling terror and the carnage of Oct. 7th. Yet, he lounges in luxury at 11201 Chalon Rd, Bel Air—a $118M mansion funded by blood money.

Qatar—which has hosted Hamas and has provided the terror group with hundreds of millions of dollars—has helped mediate the freedom of some Israeli hostages in return for a truce and the release of jailed Palestinian terrorists. Doha has previously deflected accusations of playing a double game, saying the United States requested that it open the mediation channel. Israel’s governing coalition is advancing a bill to prohibit terror-funding states from playing a role in diplomatic affairs between Israel and other countries or foreign entities, which would remove Qatar as a mediator.

Recently freed terrorist Mohammed Abu Warda seen at Hamas ‘ceremo...	The ongoing first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for up to 1,904 Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. By Pesach Benson, TPS Mohammed Abu Warda, a Palestinian terrorist freed on Jan. 30 and who was supposed to be deported to a third country, has been seen at Hamas’ handover ceremony in Khan Yunis wearing a green keffiyeh associated with the terror group. Warda was serving 48 life sentences for attacks on Israeli busses that killed 44 people in the 1990s. Among the hundreds of Palestinian terrorists released by Israel under the terms of the ceasefire are 19 who were to be deported abroad via Egypt after being taken to the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and Gaza. That crossing is adjacent to the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt. Israel’s Kan News reported that Egypt is refusing to let them enter. Hamas says it is handing over the bodies of Shiri Bibas, her sons, Ariel and Kfir, and Oded Lifshitz today. Deferring to the families, Israel is not confirming the names until the bodies are positively identified. The ongoing first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for up to 1,904 Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. The exact number will depend on how many Israeli captives are alive. Hamas notified Israeli authorities in January that of the 33, eight are dead, but offered no evidence. Since the first hostage release on Jan. 19, Hamas has freed 19 Israeli and five Thai captives in exchange for 952 imprisoned Palestinian terrorists. Hostages Tal Shoham, Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen, Avera Mengistu, and Hisham Al-Sayed are due to return home alive on Saturday. The fate of the remaining 65 hostages will be determined by negotiations during the ceasefire’s second phase. Critics say the phased approach condemns these 65 hostages to open-ended captivity and undermines Israel’s war gains. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 73 remaining hostages, more than 30 are believed to be dead.

Argentina to declare National Day of Mourning for slain Bibas fam...	The Bibas family held dual Israeli-Argentinian citizenship through their father Yarden, who was recently released from captivity. By Jewish Breaking News Ten-month-old Kfir Bibas, his four-year-old brother Ariel, and their mother Shiri never made it home to Israel alive after their abduction by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023. Instead, their story ended in three coffins being transported out of Gaza today, prompting their second homeland to prepare for a day of national mourning. 'I am informed by the government that they will wait for official information on the DNA results of the bodies and that, if confirmed, Argentina will then declare a National Day of Mourning in their honour,' President of the Argentinian Commission for Human Rights Sabrina Ajmeche wrote on X. 'Two Argentinian babies assassinated because of Hamas terrorism. I hope that never again, after this, I have to hear that what happens in Israel and Gaza is not our concern, of all Argentines.' Ajmeche also shared a video of the children with their mother, moments frozen in time when joy still seemed possible. 'They are ours, we love them always,' she wrote.

As officials now await DNA confirmation at Tel Aviv’s Abu Kabir forensic institute, Argentina’s ambassador to Israel, Axel Wahnish, voiced the nation’s collective anguish. 'Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas: EVERYONE IS THINKING ABOUT YOU. We are going through one of the most sensitive and tragic moments since that fateful Oct. 7. We accompany and support family members.' Along with the three Bibas family members, Hamas also released the body of 83-year-old hostage Oded Lifshitz. As the convoy bringing them back passed through Israel’s streets on Thursday, hundreds stood in solemn silence to pay tribute to the murdered hostages. The families will be informed after identification and have requested the public to await official confirmation, according to a statement by the Israeli police.

Azerbaijan may become a crucial player in Israeli-American vision...	The Atlantic Council, a prominent U.S. think tank, stated that the U.S. should follow Israel's lead in fostering ties with Azerbaijan. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Following a meeting this week between Hikmet Hajiyev, Assistant to the President of Azerbaijan, and Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu, officials described the 'game-changing' partnership between the Muslim nation, Israel, and the United States. 'Mr. Hajiyev conveyed the greetings of President Ilham Aliyev to Prime Minister Netanyahu,' the Azerbaijani Embassy in Israel stated. Hajiyev and Netanyahu discussed expanding bilateral cooperation, and diplomatic sources raised the possibility of including Azerbaijan in the Abraham Accords framework, alongside Israel and the U.S. The meeting between Netanyahu and Hajiyev took place just 48 hours after the Israeli Prime Minister met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The Atlantic Council, a prominent U.S. think tank, stated that the U.S. should follow Israel's lead in fostering ties with Azerbaijan. The Atlantic Council said, 'Washington should learn from Israel’s diplomatic and security collaboration with Azerbaijan to bolster its own ties with Baku. Besides being a bulwark against Iran, close relations with Azerbaijan could help the United States gain a stronger foothold among Central Asian countries, with whom Azerbaijan has been developing stronger relations.' It continued, 'This would be especially important for the United States, as Central Asia is rich in minerals and energy and is home to the Middle Corridor, a trade route from Asia to Europe that bypasses both Russia and Iran.' In addition, the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies published a special Prospective Paper titled 'How to Effectively Engage Azerbaijan in Trump’s Regional Plans and in Israel’s Interests: Practical Recommendations.' The paper emphasized that the U.S. should aim for the inclusion of Azerbaijan in American-Israeli projects, including investment and technological development. Israelis are currently developing a partnership with Morocco as part of its projects with America and seeks to apply this model to other Sunni Gulf monarchies. These partnerships span defense, AI, and cybersecurity, aligning with the Trump Administration's vision of expanding multilateral alliances in the Middle East.

Investigators confirm identity of slain hostage Oded Lifshitz	After 503 days in captivity, the remains of Oded Lifshitz have been positively identified, hours after they were returned to Israel from Gaza. By World Israel News Staff Israeli forensics examiners at the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute have positively identified the remains of one of the four bodies returned by Hamas on Thursday, confirming that the body of Oded Lifshitz was among those transferred to Israel. Lifshitz, a former journalist, was returned to Israel via the International Red Cross Thursday morning, along with the remains of Shiri Bibas and her sons, Ariel and Kfir - the two youngest hostages taken during the October 7th invasion. The four had been held in captivity in the Gaza Strip for 503 days. In a statement issued via the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, Lifshitz's family expressed their 'deep sorrow' after Oded's identity was verified. 'We have received with deep sorrow the official and bitter news of the identification of our beloved Oded’s body. 503 agonizing days of uncertainty have come to an end. We so hoped and prayed that our ending would be different.' 'Now, we can mourn the husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather who has been missing from our lives since October 7th. Our family's healing will begin now and will not be complete until the last hostage is returned.' Lifshitz, who was 83 in October 2023, was abducted, along with his wife Yocheved, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7th, 2023, before their home was torched by Hamas terrorists. The couple have been described as peace activists who volunteered to drive Gazans from the border into Israel for medical treatment. Yocheved was freed in October 2023, several weeks after being taken hostage.

Knesset votes to bar October 7th deniers from entering Israel	Under new law passed by the Knesset, Holocaust deniers, deniers of the Hamas massacres on October 7th, 2023, and anyone who supports the prosecution of Israeli soldiers will be barred from entering Israel. By World Israel News Staff The Knesset voted Wednesday night to bar Holocaust deniers and individuals who deny the Hamas massacres of Israelis on October 7th, 2023, from entering Israel. The bill, which was drafted by Coalition MK Mishel Buskila (New Hope), passed its final reading in the Knesset by a unanimous vote, 12 to 0. Based on existing legislation, the 2017 Amendment No. 28 to the Entry Into Israel Law which permits Israel to bar entry to non-citizens who have publicly endorsed the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, the new law enables the Interior Ministry to bar any non-citizen who denies the Holocaust or the October 7th massacres from entering Israel. Furthermore, the new law provides for barring entry to anyone who advocates for or publicly supports criminal prosecution abroad against Israeli soldiers or former service members. In addition, members or employees of organizations which back the prosecution of IDF soldiers abroad will also be barred from entering the country. 'The State of Israel, like any other country in the world, must defend itself, its citizens, soldiers, and national identity,' Buskila stated Wednesday ahead of the vote. 'Many countries in the world prohibit the entry of hostile entities who harm their security forces. Israel is a democratic country, but it is not naive. Those who support Israel will be respectfully welcomed. Those who attempt​ to undermine our very existence, deny the horrors of the past, or harm our soldiers and citizens, have no place among us.'

Nation mourns Bibas family, Oded Lifshitz as bodies transferred t...	Following the transfer from the Red Cross to IDF soldiers, a military memorial ceremony took place inside Gaza, featuring the Israeli flag, a salute ceremony, and a rabbi reciting from the Book of Psalms. By JNS Israel redeemed on Thursday the bodies of four slain hostages from Hamas captivity in Gaza: the three members of the Bibas family—mother Shiri, infant son Kfir and his older brother Ariel, and octogenarian Oded Lifshitz. The Red Cross handed four coffins to Israel Defense Forces troops and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) agents in the Gaza Strip, after the Geneva-based agency received the caskets from the Hamas terrorist group following a propaganda ceremony. Israel filed a complaint with mediators and the Red Cross after the Hamas stage show, saying that it breached the terms of their agreement. IDF sappers inspected the caskets, which were locked without keys, to ensure they were not booby-trapped. The IDF also verified whether any personal belongings of the hostages were returned with the bodies. A brief military ceremony was held and presided over by the chief rabbi of the IDF before the bodies were taken to Israel for identification. Israelis waving national flags and yellow flags in solidarity with the hostages lined the route of the convoy carrying the bodies to the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv for identification. There are now 69 hostages remaining in Hamas captivity in Gaza, of whom 36 are believed to be dead. Although the Israeli government has made the names public, official confirmation of the four hostages’ identity will depend on forensic analysis of the remains. On Wednesday, it emerged that the names were not to have been revealed prior to that confirmation, but were due to a miscommunication between the Israeli military and the government. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has urged the public to refrain from spreading rumors about the return of the slain captives and not to contact the families regarding the matter. 'The Coordinator for Captives and Missing Persons, Brigadier General (ret.) Gal Hirsch, has updated the families of the hostages through IDF representatives,' according to a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office on Thursday. 'In this difficult hour, our hearts are with the grieving families. We will continue to provide reliable information as required and request to avoid spreading rumors and unofficial information,' the statement continued. ‘Do not eulogize until there is confirmation‘ The Bibas family has issued a statement urging patience. 'If there is to be bitter news, we need to receive it through the proper channels after all identification procedures are completed. We ask not to eulogize our loved ones until there is confirmation after final identification,' it said.

Photo by Chaim Goldberg/Flash90. The Lifshitz family released a similar statement, noting that they had hoped things would turn out differently. 'These hours are not simple for us, after being informed that our beloved Oded is on the list of deceased hostages to be returned to Israel on Thursday, after being taken alive from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz [on Oct. 7, 2023]. For 502 days we hoped and prayed for a different ending, but until we receive absolute certainty our journey will not end, and even afterward we will continue to fight until the return of the last hostage. We ask the media and the public not to contact us regarding this matter at present and to respect our privacy.' Early morning: Handover process to begin The initial stage of the handover involved the Red Cross receiving the fallen from Hamas at a predetermined location in Khan Yunis before transferring them to the IDF. Following the transfer, a military memorial ceremony took place inside Gaza, featuring the Israeli flag, a salute ceremony and a rabbi reciting from the Book of Psalms. Dr. Gilad Bodenheimer, who heads Mental Health Services at the Israeli Ministry of Health, has advised against extended viewing of broadcasts covering the return: 'We anticipate an extremely complex day as we receive the fallen hostages, and strongly recommend that the public limit their media exposure and minimize their viewing of Hamas psychological warfare tactics.' Al-Qassam Brigades terrorists stand guard while Palestinians wait for the handover of the bodies of four Israeli hostages to the Red Cross in Khan Yunis, the Gaza Strip, Feb. 20, 2025. Photo by Saeed Mohammed/Flash90. Identification process Following their return to Israel, the coffins were transported under police escort directly to the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv for identification. There, experts were set to conduct tests to determine the cause and time of death. The institute will employ standard identification methods including imaging scans, DNA sample extraction and laboratory analysis, and comparison with existing medical records such as dental X-rays. Reference samples have already been prepared, including DNA profiles provided by the Israel Police. According to the IDF, the identification process may take up to 48 hours, depending on the condition of the remains. The families will be integral to the entire process. At their own request, they will remain at home rather than at a designated location, accompanied by IDF representatives. They will observe the military ceremony in real time, with documentation to be distributed afterward. The IDF will inform the families of the identification results before any public announcement is made. Professor Chen Kugel, who directs the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, elaborated: 'We will exhaust every possibility to determine the circumstances of death. This isn’t always achievable, particularly with fallen who arrive after an extended period. Our commitment is to do everything possible to provide answers to the families about what happened to their loved ones.' The confidential clause Political officials have clarified that this release represents an unpublicized portion of the phase one ceasefire agreement, whereby eight hostages who died in captivity are to be returned in two stages. In exchange, Israel will free women and minors detained in Gaza after Oct. 7, 2023. Simultaneously, mediating parties are preparing for discussions about the deal’s second phase. Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari stated on Tuesday that negotiations for the second phase haven’t officially commenced, though he confirmed that delegations from both Israel and Hamas are present in Doha.

How Jewish traditions kept hostages alive in Gaza captivity	Agam Berger, Keith Siegel, and Eli Sharabi reported how they put faith in God, prayed and tried to keep Jewish holy days in captivity. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Acts of Jewish faith helped keep several hostages alive, they have reported since being released from Hamas captivity over the last several weeks. IDF observer Agam Berger, who was abducted from the Nahal Oz army base on the border with Gaza, told Channel 12 Thursday that she and her fellow observers had managed to observe many of the Jewish holidays. 'We sometimes had access to a radio, and sometimes we saw things on television that helped us track the date. We also had a foreign calendar,' she said. 'We missed both Hanukkah holidays, but we celebrated Passover, and I didn’t eat chametz [leavened food products that are forbidden],' she noted. 'I asked for cornmeal, and the captors brought it to me.' Although the captives were given very little food, with the women previously revealing that they counted the rice grains they received to ensure everyone got an equal amount, Berger even observed several fast days. These included the two important ones, Yom Kippur and Tisha B’Av, but also Taanit Esther, which is a minor fast day that many do not keep under perfectly normal conditions. Berger also kept the Sabbath as much as she could and, with the other women, constantly used a prayerbook that a terrorist had found in a field. 'They asked us what it was and then gave it to us. We used it throughout our captivity,' she said, noting that her captors seemed to respect the fact that they wanted to perform Jewish rites, even giving them Sabbath candles to light at certain points. 'They said all of Judaism is a lie, but they preferred someone who believes in God over someone who doesn’t,' she said. In an interview on Channel 14 Wednesday, the daughter of American-Israel hostage Keith Siegel, said that her father had 'searched for his Jewish identity while in captivity, and he found it in small prayers.' 'He began saying blessings over food,' Shir Siegel said, 'which he had never said before, and ‘Shema Yisrael’, which he had never recited in his life.' The Shema is one of the iconic Jewish prayers that announces one’s belief in a single God of Israel. 'He said that amidst all that hell, he wanted to remember that he was Jewish, that there was meaning to his people and to the place from which he came, and that strengthened him greatly,' she said. Siegel was starved, moved 33 times over 15 months, was often kept in the dark while being told to lie down and keep silent, and spent the last two months of captivity alone. The Shema also featured strongly in the life of Eli Sharabi, who was freed on February 8. His brother Sharon told Channel 12 last week that every day of captivity, Eli had made sure to say the prayer. He and the other hostages he was with also kept track of the days of the week, and every Friday night, in honor of the incoming Sabbath, he would recite the Kiddush, a blessing recited over wine or grape juice before the meal – although they had nothing to drink or eat, as they were cruelly starved by their captors. They also sang the 'Woman of Valor' Sabbath song, which men traditionally sing each week in praise of their wives. All these acts of faith 'is what kept them going,' Sharabi said. Crushingly, Eli found out upon his release that his wife, Lianne, as well as his daughters Noya (16) and Yahel (13), had been murdered in their Kibbutz Be’eri home by terrorists during the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 invasion, among 1,200 others slaughtered in Gaza envelope communities and a dance festival.

Blaming Netanyahu for captives’ deaths, Hamas uses coffins for vi...	Hamas uses coffins of dead captives for anti-Israel display during ceremony marking the handing over of remains of four Israeli hostages - while accusing IDF of killing the hostages. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization held a victory celebration in the southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Yunis Thursday morning, putting the coffins of four Israeli hostages on display before they were handed over to Israel as part of the hostage deal. At 9:40 a.m., Hamas transferred the remains of Oded Lifshitz, Shiri Bibas, and her sons Ariel and Kfir, to the International Red Cross, which handed the bodies over to an IDF force. Prior to the handoff, however, Hamas displayed the coffins of the four slain hostages on a stage set up on an abandoned cemetery in Khan Yunis, as part of a ceremony and photo op, during which Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the United States were denounced and blamed for the deaths of the four hostages. Masked Hamas terrorists met with International Red Cross officials on the stage, signing off papers certifying the transfer of the hostages' remains. The coffins of the four victims were displayed underneath a massive sign portraying Netanyahu as a vampire. 'The War Criminal Netanyahu & His Nazi Army Killed Them with Missiles from Zionist Warplanes,' the sign read. Mock missiles and rockets set up around the stage carried messages blaming the U.S. for the hostages' deaths. 'They were killed by USA bombs.' Underneath photographs of the hostages, Hamas wrote 'The Killer,' above a photograph of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, along with the date 11-2023, implying the hostages were killed in November 2023. During the victory ceremony in Khan Yunis, thousands of Gazans gathered and cheered as Hamas displayed the coffins of the slain hostages, clapping and whistling as organizers played celebratory music. Terrorists present at the event brandished weapons, including machine guns, grenades, anti-personnel mines, and even missiles. Mohammed Abu Warda, a Hamas terrorist and convicted mass murderer, was among those in attendance at the ceremony. Abu Warda, who was released as part of the hostage deal, was convicted of multiple counts of murder and sentenced to 48 consecutive life sentences for his role in a pair of suicide bomb attacks in the 1990s.

Trump admin designates drug cartels as global terrorist organizat...	Classifying the cartels as terrorist groups helps disrupt their 'finances through sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans,' though the scope of Wednesday's designations remains unclear, Reuters reported. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon The United States has designated Tren de Aragua, the Sinaloa cartel, and six other drug cartels as global terrorist organizations, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday in a notice. The cartels threaten U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economic stability, according to the notice. The designations follow President Donald Trump's executive order directing officials to assess whether transnational gangs and drug cartels should be classified as terrorist organizations. The move marks a significant escalation in Trump's efforts to combat cartel-driven crime following record-high illegal border crossings under the Biden administration. Classifying the cartels as terrorist groups helps disrupt their 'finances through sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans,' though the scope of Wednesday's designations remains unclear, Reuters reported. Last May, then-Drug Enforcement Administration head Anne Milgram, a Biden appointee, said the United States is facing 'the most dangerous and deadly drug crisis' in history, particularly pointing to 'synthetic, chemical-based drugs, like fentanyl and methamphetamine.' Fentanyl is responsible for around 70 percent of overdose deaths, the DEA noted at the time, with meth responsible for the remaining 30 percent. 'At the heart of the synthetic drug crisis are the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels and their associates,' Milgram said. Since taking office, Trump has declared a national border emergency and ordered top officials to prepare to invoke a 1798 law that could allow the administration to swiftly deport suspected gang members without court hearings. Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, has reinforced border security and overseen the deportation of thousands of illegal immigrants. Tren de Aragua, a violent Venezuelan gang, has expanded its operations across several U.S. cities, terrorizing residents at apartment complexes and engaging in human trafficking, extortion, and drug smuggling. Federal authorities have arrested dozens affiliated with the gang, including 67 members on January 26 alone. Mexico's Sinaloa cartel is 'woven into our communities,' both in major U.S. cities and other places, retired Drug Enforcement Administration supervisory special agent Brian Townsend told Fox News on Tuesday. 'We have some larger locations that are well known for Sinaloa control, like Chicago, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Tucson, Dallas, Atlanta, and New York City.' 'But they have distribution points throughout the United States,' Townsend went on, 'and from there, they use those hubs, and then [the distribution] spoke out from there into our communities.'

Israeli forces kill three armed terrorists near Jenin	Following the engagement, security forces conducted thorough searches, uncovering a disassembled M-16 rifle hidden underground, additional weaponry, and a handgun. By JNS Israeli forces killed three armed terrorists in the Al-Fara area south of Jenin in northern Samaria on Wednesday, according to the military.

ICC used flawed data to secure arrest warrants against Israeli le...	UKLFI’s latest review shows that reports of famine on which the prosecutor relied were not plausible and were based on inaccurate and anomalous data regarding food supplies and malnutrition.' By Jewish Breaking News Significant errors and flawed methodology tainted the evidence of famine in Gaza that led to the International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. According to UK Lawyers for Israel Charitable Trust (UKLFI), the evidence for these claims simply doesn’t hold up. First, the very definition of famine was misapplied. The term 'famine' isn’t just dramatic language but rather a specific scientific classification developed in Somalia in 2004 by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. UKLFI’s report argues that Gaza’s crisis, while 'undoubtedly serious,' doesn’t meet these technical standards. Second, the ICC relied heavily on data from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS Net), a USAID initiative that’s now offline following Trump administration funding freezes. Third, the report identifies what it calls 'inaccurate and anomalous data' about food supplies and malnutrition rates, suggesting that worst-case scenarios were presented as inevitable outcomes rather than possibilities. 'Warrants for the arrest of Netanyahu and Gallant have been issued by the ICC on the false ground that Israel deliberately used starvation as a method of war,' says Jonathan Turner, UKLFI’s executive director. 'UKLFI’s latest review shows that reports of famine on which the prosecutor relied were not plausible and were based on inaccurate and anomalous data regarding food supplies and malnutrition.' UKLFI’s report calls for more rigorous standards in assessing humanitarian crises, including clearer distinctions between current conditions, projections, and worst-case scenarios. The stakes are too high for anything less. Just recently, ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan found himself banned from entering the U.S. under new sanctions. President Donald Trump’s executive order blasted what he called the court’s 'illegitimate and baseless actions' against Israel. Meanwhile, the ICC’s oversight body has been tasked to investigate allegations that Khan tried to coerce a female aide against her will. Khan has repeatedly denied the allegations, stating there is 'no truth' to the claim.

Trump halts US funding of Palestinian police – report	The cut in funding is part of the Trump administration’s overall freeze on international aid. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The U.S. has frozen funding for the Palestinian Authority's (PA) security forces, as part of the Trump administration’s overall freeze on international aid, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. In Trump’s first stint as president, he stopped direct aid to the PA but kept on funding the training of its security forces, which is implemented through the U.S. Security Coordinator’s Office (USSC) in Jerusalem. The paper cited an anonymous former Israeli official as saying that the USSC 'was not significantly affected' by the cut, as 'other donors have committed to make up the shortfall.' Palestinian sources say that there have been immediate ramifications due to the freeze. A colonel in the PA’s Central Training Institute told the Post that as a result of the freeze it had to stop construction of a virtual shooting range, although it was nearly complete. The security forces officially learn to shoot this way because out of security concerns, Israel forbids the importation of real bullets to the PA. The tens of thousands of men dispersed among the various branches of the Palestinian Security Services are well-armed, however, as evidenced by the recent deadly clashes in Jenin, when the PA failed in its attempt to take control of the city that is a hotbed of terrorist groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad that want to overthrow the Authority. Another Palestinian official said that a meeting that had been organized between PA and American security forces to assess the PA’s performance in Jenin had been indefinitely postponed. The USSC has been providing direct financial and personnel assistance to Palestinian security organizations since 2005 and training them since 2007. According to the State Department, besides upgrading the Palestinians’ military abilities to 'assist in ending violence' internally, another major part of its mission is to 'facilitat[e] security cooperation' with Israel, and 'setting security conditions for a peace agreement.' One of its original aims was also to 'allay Israeli fears about the nature and capabilities of the Palestinian Authority Security Forces (PASF),' in the words of Lt. Gen. Keith Dayton, who led the Office for its first five years. While top Israeli military and intelligence officials have considered security coordination with the PA as vital to the IDF’s anti-terror efforts in Judea and Samaria throughout the years, the government also sees the PASF as a danger. Although potential recruits are officially extensively vetted by the U.S. for any affiliation with a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization and for human rights violations, Palestinian security personnel have been responsible for hundreds of terror attacks on Israeli civilians over the past two decades.

The power of faith: How Tzili Schneider became a beacon of hope f...	Schneider's journey with the families of Israel’s hostages did not begin with a grand strategy, but with a deep, empathetic connection to their suffering—one that ultimately reignited the nation’s faith. By Linda Argalgi Sadacka, Special to World Israel News In times of profound adversity, certain individuals emerge as beacons of hope, transforming personal anguish into collective resilience. Tzili Schneider, founder of Kesher Yehudi (Jewish Connection), is one such figure. Her journey with the families of Israel’s hostages did not begin with a grand strategy, but with a deep, empathetic connection to their suffering—one that ultimately reignited the nation’s faith. A mission born from heartbreak Moved by the plight of parents, siblings, and children of those taken captive, Tzili immersed herself in the protest tents of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, offering support in the only way that truly mattered: by listening. She posed a pivotal question to these families: 'What do you desire most?' The answer was immediate and unanimous: 'Our children.' But then she asked a deeper question: 'From whom are you seeking their return?' Tzili Schneider (back shown) comforts Merav Gonen, mother of freed hostage Romi Gonen. Door on right leads to a synagogue. (Courtesy) The realization was profound. Beyond political figures, beyond military strategies, beyond backdoor negotiations—their hope rested in a higher power: God. It was this moment of clarity that led Tzili to propose something radical: a national call for faith—a single, unified Shabbat (Sabbath) observed across the country as a plea for divine mercy. This was not a tactical maneuver. It was a recognition of an eternal truth: Jewish survival has never been political. It has always been spiritual. A movement that transcended divisions The response was overwhelming. Communities across Israel mobilized, bridging gaps between secular and religious Jews in a way that had seemed impossible just weeks before. Through Kesher Yehudi, Tzili spearheaded this unprecedented movement, guiding over 35 hostage families toward a deeper spiritual connection. This unity was not about external labels. It was about an unshakable Jewish instinct—the knowledge that, in times of crisis, Jews trust one another. The lookouts stationed on the border, the kidnapped soldiers, the civilians dragged into Gaza—all of them had endured the valley of the shadow of death with one unifying truth: They never lost their faith. Faith in the depths of Gaza These hostages did not emerge from the tunnels of Gaza as the same people they were before. Throughout their captivity, they clung to Jewish identity as a lifeline—observing mitzvot (Torah commandments) wherever and however they could. They fasted on Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement), refrained from eating non-kosher food, and even kept Shabbat in the heart of enemy territory. The lookouts, in particular, observed several mitzvot together, including Yom Kippur, Tisha B’Av (the Ninth of Av, a day of mourning for the destruction of the Temples), and avoiding chametz (leavened bread) on Pesach (Passover). Not a single one of them agreed to eat chametz throughout the entire holiday. They knew exactly which day was Shabbat and did their best to observe it. Among them, Agam Berger, an IDF surveillance soldier, became a pillar of strength. Captured during the attack on Nahal Oz on October 7, 2023, she endured 482 days in captivity—and throughout it all, she refused to compromise her faith. She fully observed Shabbat and refused to eat non-kosher meat, even as her captors starved her. Not once did she break, despite her friends pleading with her to eat for her own survival. When Agam’s mother, Meirav Berger, learned of her release, she was filled with gratitude—not only for her daughter’s return but for the unwavering faith that sustained her through captivity. 'We saw God with our own eyes' This was not an isolated phenomenon. Every hostage who emerged from Gaza carried the same testimony: 'We saw God with our own eyes.' For Romi Gonen, the first girl to be released in the most recent deal, the experience of captivity led to a profound transformation. Her mother, Merav Gonen, was the very first person to sign up for a national Shabbat initiative, dedicating her observance to the release of the hostages. Exactly one year later, Romi was freed. When she finally embraced her mother, her first words were not about the suffering she endured. Instead, she declared: 'I am Jewish. I was in captivity, and there I truly felt that I was Jewish. And being Jewish means keeping Shabbat. So from now on, we will keep Shabbat.' She was not alone. Kfir Segal, an elderly Jewish man, endured some of the harshest conditions of captivity. His captors starved him, humiliated him, spat on him, and beat him—yet his faith remained unshaken. Freed hostage Agam Berger, who has spoken publicly about maintaining her faith during captivity, receives a prayer book from Tzili Schneider. (Courtesy) Upon his release, he turned to his children and made a single request: 'We had 500 days to reflect on ourselves. A lot of time to think. My thoughts led me to God and to the realization that I am Jewish. From now on, I want all of us to sit together and learn about our own Judaism.' The Kiddush that kept hope alive Omer Shem Tov was taken captive on Shabbat Kodesh (the holy Sabbath) and remains in captivity to this day. Just a few days after his abduction, by Tuesday or Wednesday, he turned to his friend Itai and asked: 'Shabbat is coming soon. How will we make Kiddush (blessing over wine or grape juice to sanctify the Shabbat and holidays)? I have never missed reciting Kiddush on Shabbat.' Itai asked their captors about it, and the next day, they received a tiny bottle of grape juice. Omer carefully rationed the bottle, using just a drop each week for Kiddush, knowing that their captivity could last years. Every Shabbat, he recited Kiddush by heart in the darkness of the tunnels. His mother, Shelly Shem Tov, became fully Shabbat-observant as a result. She joined a group of women learning the laws of Shabbat, determined that when Omer returns, everything in their home will be done according to halacha (Jewish law). The same was true for Sasha Tropanov, whose mother and grandmother were kidnapped alongside him. They were freed in the first hostage deal over a year ago—and each of them independently decided to become religious. In a now-viral video, Sasha is seen wearing tefillin (phylacteries) upon his return home this past Shabbat, his first request after being reunited with his family. His mother, Yelena, always knew that when he came back, he would follow the same spiritual path she had chosen. Because when you see God with your own eyes, there is no other path. The time for faith and unity is now These are not stories of religious coercion. They are stories of spiritual awakening—of Jews who faced the abyss, held onto their identity, and emerged with an unshakable belief in Hashem’s (G-d’s) presence in their lives. This is the lesson that Tzili Schneider and Kesher Yehudi have been working tirelessly to share: Faith is not a relic of the past. It is the foundation of Jewish survival. The hostages have returned with a message: Our future belongs to those who stand firm, who hold fast to their faith, and who refuse to surrender—no matter the cost.

Republicans divided over Trump’s Gaza plan	Americans largely oppose president's plan to take control of the Gaza Strip, new polls find, with Republicans sharply divided over the proposal. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Few Americans support President Donald Trump's plan to place the war torn Gaza Strip under U.S. control, with even the president's own party sharply divided over the proposal. According to a poll published by Quinnipiac University on Wednesday, just 22% of registered voters say they back Trump's bid to take over the Gaza Strip, compared to 62% of respondents who oppose it. A plurality of Republicans back the plan, with 49% saying they support it, compared to 32% who oppose it. However, just 1% of Democrats support the proposal, compared to 94% who oppose it. Among independents, just 17% say they support the plan, compared to 66% who oppose it. 'The grand plan to transform a shattered Gaza into a lavish American restoration project on the Mediterranean has many more skeptics than supporters,' said Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy. Respondents were somewhat more supportive of Trump's handling of the Israel - Hamas conflict, with 38% said they approved of his policies on the issue, including 78% of Republicans, 37% of independents, and 4% of Democrats. By contrast, 47% of registered voters disapprove, including 9% of Republicans, 48% of independents, and 87% of Democrats. A second poll released Wednesday also found little support for Trump's Gaza plan. The survey, conducted by Emerson College Polling, found that just 18% of Americans support Trump's Gaza plan, with 58% opposing it. Unlike the Quinnipiac poll, Emerson found that a plurality of Republicans oppose the proposal, by a margin of 45% against to 31% in favor. Just 12% of Democrats and 10% of independents back the plan. Trump's Gaza plan appears to be significantly more popular among Israelis, however, with 75% of Israeli Jews telling the Lazar Research Institute in a recent poll that they support the proposal. The Quinnipiac poll surveyed 1,039 self-identified registered voters nationwide from February 13th through the 17th, and has a margin of error of +/- 3.0 points. The Emerson poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters and has a similar margin of error. It was conducted from February 15th through the 17th.

Bodies of Shiri Bibas, her children, and Oded Lifshitz returned t...	Hamas hands over the remains of four Israeli civilians - including the two youngest hostages - to Israel via the International Red Cross. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization handed over the remains of four slain Israeli civilians held hostage since October 7th, 2023, to the International Red Cross Thursday morning, as part of the ongoing hostage deal and Gaza ceasefire. The captives include 85-year-old Oded Lifshitz, 33-year-old Shiri Bibas, and her two sons - the youngest Israelis taken hostage by Gazan terrorists on October 7th - Ariel and Kfir. The two boys would have been five and two years old respectively. After an event held by Hamas in the Bani Suheila neighborhood of the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis Thursday morning, during which four coffins were presented on stage, the remains of the four Israeli captives were transferred to the International Red Cross at 9:50 a.m. Half an hour later, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office announced that the coffins carrying the four slain hostages had been handed over to an IDF force. 'Israel has received, through the Red Cross, the coffins of four fallen hostages,' the PMO said. 'The coffins were handed over to the IDF and Shin Bet forces, within the Gaza Strip area, from where they will be transferred to Israel to the National Forensic Medicine Institute of the Ministry of Health. After the identification process is completed, an official notice will be delivered to the families.' 'The families of the hostages have been updated, and in this difficult time, our hearts are with them.' Lifshitz, a former journalist, was abducted, along with his wife Yocheved, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7th, 2023, before their home was torched by Hamas terrorists. The couple have been described as peace activists who volunteered to drive Gazans from the border into Israel for medical treatment. Shiri Bibas and her children, Ariel and Kfir, were also residents of Nir Oz. Video taken at around 10:00 a.m. on October 7th shows the three being taken hostage by a group of terrorists aligned with the Katayeb al-Mujahideen group. 'Agony. Pain. There are no words,' President Isaac Herzog said Thursday morning following the transfer of the hostages' remains. 'Our hearts — the hearts of an entire nation — lie in tatters.' 'On behalf of the State of Israel, I bow my head and ask for forgiveness. Forgiveness for not protecting you on that terrible day. Forgiveness for not bringing you home safely. May their memory be a blessing.'

Religious Zionism: If Gaza war ends, we’ll leave the gov’t	MK Moshe Solomon stresses his party will leave the coalition, if Israel does not return to fighting Hamas by March 2nd. By World Israel News Staff A politician from the Religious Zionism party stressed his faction's position that Israel must resume hostilities against the Hamas terror group, or else face the collapse of the government. MK Moshe Solomon said in a recent radio interview that the second phase of the hostage deal requires a full IDF withdrawal from Gaza and a long-term ceasefire, which his party is unwilling to support. 'I expect [Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] and cabinet to fulfil their commitment where we complete phase 1 of the deal and [then] act with military force against the Hamas terror organization. I believe this is how we can bring back the hostages who are [still] there,' Solomon told Radio North. 'Currently, phase 1 has ended with everything that was promised, despite Hamas's violations.' When asked about phase two of the deal, which would see Israeli troops retreat from Gaza in exchanged for the return of additional live hostages, Solomon said it 'won't happen.' Solomon noted that the ceasefire outlined in the first stage of the deal is slated to last for 42 days. If Israel does not return to fighting on Sunday, March 2nd, Religious Zionism will leave the government, Solomon added. Opposition parties, including Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid, have pledged to provide a safety net to Netanyahu's Likud, in order to ensure the hostage deal continues. The status of negotiations for the terms of the second phase of the ceasefire is currently unclear. President Donald Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff has expressed confidence that despite the concerns of some right-wing Israeli parties, the second stage of the ceasefire and hostage deal will happen. Speaking to Fox News earlier this week, Witkoff said that 'phase two is absolutely going to begin.' He added at a memorial event marking 500 days since October 7th, 2023, that 'we are not leaving anybody behind. We have to get everybody home.'

Ari Fuld’s murderer and other terrorists to be freed Saturday	There’s no guidebook for how to feel when your brother is murdered and gone forever, while his killer will walk free,' writes Hillel Fuld. By World Israel News Staff A number of high-profile terrorists, including the man who killed American-Israeli Ari Fuld, are set to be freed Saturday in exchange for the return of six Israeli hostages from Hamas captivity. The release will see 602 terrorists freed from Israeli prisons, including 157 sentenced to life or decades-long sentences. The murderer of Ari Fuld, Khalil Yusef Ali Jabarin, who was 17 at the time of the murder, is slated to be released after spending just six years in an Israeli prison. 'The monster who changed our family forever is now on the list of terrorists set to be freed as part of the upcoming hostage deal. Upon hearing the news of this terrorist's release, I had to catch my breath,' wrote Fuld's brother Hillel, a prominent tech blogger and consultant, in a column published in Ynet. 'There’s no guidebook for how to feel when your brother is murdered and gone forever, while his killer will walk free and live as a regular citizen.' While Fuld stressed that he felt extremely conflicted about the release, he added that he understood the release would save the lives of the hostages - which brings him some comfort. Another notorious terrorist scheduled for release on Saturday is Bilal Abu Ghanem, who murdered three Israelis in a shooting and stabbing spree on a Jerusalem bus in October 2015. Originally sentenced to 135 years, Abu Ghanem will be freed after serving less than ten years for the murders of Haim Haviv, 78, Alon Govberg, 51, and Richard Lakin, 76. Na’el al-Barghouti, 68, is also expected to be released after serving 45 years for the 1978 murder of bus driver Mordechai Yakuel. Notably, al-Barghouti was freed in the 2011 Gilad Shalit deal, but later re-arrested. He will likely be deported to a third country. According to Hebrew-language media reports, al-Barghouti is a relative and close confidant of arch-terrorist Marwan Barghouti.

Woman wounded in Jerusalem axe attack, police hunt assailant	Suspect broke into elderly woman's home and attacked her with an axe; police launch manhunt to arrest perpetrator. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli woman was attacked by an axe-wielding assailant late Wednesday night, with the manhunt for the perpetrator still ongoing. The victim, reported by Hebrew-language media as being in her 70s, was moderately wounded in the attack, which occurred at her home in the Old City. According to Ynet, the suspect, armed with an axe, broke into the woman's home. After the attack, he reportedly removed the hoodie he had been wearing - likely due to blood stains - and fled the scene. 'I arrived at the scene and saw the victim, [who was] fully conscious. She was lying [on the floor] with injuries to her upper body,' said Yossi Kasuto, a senior Magen David Adom paramedic, in a media statement. 'I gave her life-saving medical treatment and we transferred her to the special MDA ATV that evacuated her through the narrow alleyways of Jerusalem&#8230;to an ambulance that was waiting at the Zion Gate. From there we evacuated her while continuing medical treatment to the hospital, with her condition [being] moderate and stable.' The police said in a press statement that they had dispatched forensic officers to gather evidence at the scene;. The Jerusalem Police District Commander 'conducted a situational assessment, during which he directed the use of all means and forces in order to locate the suspect who fled.' As of Thursday, the police have yet to locate the attacker. Details about his identity and the motivation for the attack have not yet been made public. In December 2024, a janitor who worked in a Jerusalem apartment building broke into the home of an elderly Jewish woman. He strangled and stabbed the woman, 74, then stole her jewelry and fled the apartment, believing he had murdered her. The woman, seriously wounded, managed to call for help. The suspect was arrested hours later, and the attempted murder was classified as a terror attack by Israeli authorities.

Berger, 20, was one of five lookouts who scouted the Gaza border, were kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023 and released after 15 months. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News On Monday, U.S. President Trump reposted a video of freed hostage Agam Berger, who thanked him for securing her release and advocating for the other hostages. Berger, 20, was one of five lookouts who scouted the Gaza border and were kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023. She was released in the first phase of the hostage deal. Berger thanked Trump, saying, 'From the bottom of my heart, thank you for all you have done and all that you continue to do for the hostages.' 'Because of you, we came home,' she said, explaining that there are still people who depend on him and are waiting for him to save them. Berger added that President Trump 'has the power to do it.' The hostage deal took effect on January 19, the day before Trump's inauguration as President of the United States. 'I beg you, don’t stop until all the hostages, both the living and the dead, are brought home,' Berger said to Trump. Donald Trump Truth Social Post 07:45 PM EST 02/17/25 pic.twitter.com/ngMTnpnxX7 &mdash; Donald J. Trump Posts From His Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) February 18, 2025 On Thursday, the bodies of four hostages, including Shiri Bibas and her two young children, will be returned to Gaza. On Saturday, six living hostages are expected to be released. Berger was released along with Israeli civilians Arbel Yehud, 29, and Gadi Mozes, 80 along with five Thai workers. The other four female IDF lookouts, Liri Albag, Naama Levy, Karina Ariev, and Daniella Gilboa, were released a week earlier. Dr. Lena Koren Feldman, director of Rabin Medical Center’s Beilinson Hospital, told Israel’s Channel 12 News that the four IDF soldiers kidnapped alongside Berger and who were released by Hamas on Saturday screamed with excitement when they saw her being freed. Agam Berger and other hostages maintained religious observance during their captivity in Gaza. Liri Albag reported that Agam Berger held fast to her religious observance during her captivity, including keeping kosher and observing Shabbat. 'Despite the difficult conditions and limited options, Agam chose to stay true to her values and her faith,' Liri said. Liri’s mother, Merav, said that her daughter did not eat any of the non-kosher meat offered to her during captivity, despite the lack of food. Prior to her daughter’s release, Merav Berger requested that if her daughter would be released on Saturday, that those involved and the media should avoid violating Shabbat.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A forensic expert stated that identifying the bodies of hostages who have been held in Gaza for an extended period may not always be possible. On Thursday, the bodies of four hostages, held in captivity for over 500 days, are expected to be returned to Israel. Dr. Chen Kugel, director of the L. Greenberg Institute of Forensic Medicine at Abu Kabir, described the process of examining and identifying the bodies before they are sent for burial. Dr. Kugel will work alongside pathologists, DNA analysts, anthropologists, radiologists, and forensic technicians. Kugel explained that identification is carried out using various scientific methods, all of which involve comparing data from the deceased with records from when they were still living. The first step in the process is a CT scan, which creates a detailed internal image. Radiologists then compare this image with previous medical records. The next phase is the autopsy, during which DNA samples will be sent to the lab for analysis, and forensic dentists will compare the teeth with existing dental records. The entire process will take several days. Afterward, the family will be contacted, and the public will receive updates, if permitted by the family. Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, head of the Medical Directorate at the Health Ministry, stated, 'The upcoming phase tomorrow is both complex and sensitive, and we will do everything in our power to ensure the slain hostages are laid to rest as swiftly as possible.' Israel is preparing to receive the bodies of hostages who were murdered in captivity in the Gaza Strip on Thursday. The ceasefire deal with the Palestinian terrorist group stipulates that the bodies of four hostages will be returned to the Jewish state on the 33rd day of the ceasefire, which began on Jan. 19. Among those whose bodies will be handed over to Israel on Thursday are Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir.

By Aamer Madhani, Jonathan Cooper, Associated Press President Donald Trump called Volodymyr Zelenskyy a 'dictator without elections,' lashing out after the Ukrainian president said Trump was being influenced by Russian disinformation as he moves to end the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine on terms that Kyiv says are too favorable to Moscow. Trump called Volodymyr Zelenskyy a 'dictator without elections,' lashing out after the Ukrainian president said Trump was being influenced by Russian disinformation as he moves to end the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine on terms that Kyiv says are too favorable to Moscow. In a post on Truth Social, Trump called Zelenskyy 'a modestly successful comedian' who talked the United States into spending billions of dollars 'to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start.' He said Ukraine would be unable to end the war without Trump’s help. Trump’s post comes a day after he suggested in a news conference that Ukraine should hold elections as part of a peace plan. 'A Dictator without Elections,' Trump wrote Wednesday. Zelenskyy was elected president in 2019 after a career as an entertainer. He resisted pressure to leave the country when Russia invaded in 2022, mounting a defense that protected the capital, Kyiv. Zelenskyy accused Trump earlier Wednesday of living in a Russian-made 'disinformation space.'

Bibas family ‘in deep turmoil’ following Hamas announcement	Bibas family: 'Until we receive definitive confirmation, our ordeal is not over. We kindly ask the media and the public to respect our privacy and refrain from contacting us about this issue.' The Bibas family said on Tuesday that they were troubled by a Hamas statement earlier in the day that the bodies of Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, are among those the terrorist group will return to Israel on Thursday. 'In the past few hours, we have been in deep turmoil following the announcement by a Hamas spokesperson regarding the planned return of our beloved Shiri, Ariel and Kfir this Thursday as part of the release of hostages’ remains,' the family said in a statement provided by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. 'We want to emphasize that while we are aware of these reports, we have not received any official confirmation on the matter,' the statement continued. 'Until we receive definitive confirmation, our ordeal is not over. We kindly ask the media and the public to respect our privacy and refrain from contacting us about this issue.' The Israel Defense Forces also responded to the reports, emphasizing that the public should follow official military statements regarding the state of the hostages. 'In the past few hours, unfounded rumors have been spreading regarding the hostages and their families,' the IDF said. 'The IDF urges the public to rely only on official statements from authorized sources and to refrain from spreading false rumors that harm the hostages’ families and the public.' Hamas agreed on Tuesday to double the number of living hostages it will release on Saturday from three to six, and the terror group has also said that it will release the bodies of four dead hostages on Thursday, including those of Shiri Bibas and her two children. Shiri Bibas, 33, her husband Yarden, 35, and Ariel, 5 and Kfir, 2, were on the list of the 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement. However, Hamas had claimed in November 2023 that Shiri and the children had been killed. Yarden was freed alive on Feb. 1 along with Ofer Kalderon and Keith Siegel. Eight of the 33 hostages intended for release during the first phase are dead, according to a list provided by Hamas. Hamas named the Israelis to be freed on Saturday as Tal Shoham, Omer Shem-Tov, Omer Wenkert and Eliya Cohen, all of whom were kidnapped during the terrorist group’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. In addition, Hamas said it would also release Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who have been held captive in the Strip for a decade and reportedly suffer from mental illness. An Israeli official told Maariv on Tuesday that the body of Hadar Goldin will not be returned to Israel this week but is expected to be transferred toward the end of phase one next week. Hamas has held Goldin’s body since he was killed during 'Operation Protective Edge' in 2014.

New Syrian textbooks designed to produce more jihadis	In the new schoolbooks, the role of women in Arab history is being deliberately downplayed; for Islam relegates women to a lower rank than men. By Hugh Fitzgerald, Frontpage Magazine The new textbooks in Syria of course eliminate all praise, direct and indirect, of the Assad family, father and son, but when it comes to Israel and Jews, those textbooks remain unchanged: 'New Syrian government issues textbooks filled with antisemitism and praise for terrorists,' by Jane Prinsley, Jewish Chronicle, February 7, 2025: Multiple maps in a geography textbook for 14 – 15-year-olds present all of Israel’s internationally recognized territory as Palestine. The Israel-controlled Golan Heights are presented as part of Syria, and the textbook cover features an image of the Sea of Galilee, which is located within Israeli territory, potentially suggesting that the lake, or parts of it, belong to Syria. It’s unclear whether Israel is depicted as existing within the 1949 armistice lines, or if has been effaced altogether. What is clear is that the Israel that now exists is not shown on those maps. Some historical women have been removed, including references to Nazik al-Abid, known as the 'Joan of Arc of the Arabs', Queen Zenobia and Khawla bint al-Azwar, in Islamic education and social studies textbooks for children aged eight to nine years old…. In the new schoolbooks, the role of women in Arab history is being deliberately downplayed; for Islam relegates women to a lower rank than men. In the 20th century, Nazik al-Abid obtained her fame as a defender of women’s rights; this is not a cause that the new Islamic regime would favor. Queen Zenobia dates from the 3rd century A.D., which means she lived during the Time of Ignorance, the Jahaliyya, so is hardly someone to emulate or admire. And Khawla bint al-Azwar, a warrior during the time of the Rashidun, believed that Ali was the first rightly-guided caliph, making her in effect a Shi’a, and she would naturally have no place in the schoolbook pantheon of the new, uber-Sunni regime in Damascus. The watchdog also found that some 'secular scientific concepts perceived to be un-Islamic' have been removed. An entire chapter in a biology textbook for 13 – 14-year-olds on evolution has been removed. All devout Muslims know that 'evolution' is only a 'theory.' And since evolution is contradicted by Islamic teachings, it is best to put off teaching it to students until they can be 'Islamically' prepared to withstand its appeal, 'Martyrdom' will be reframed in the new textbooks from a national to a religious perspective. One year 10 lesson will glorify martyrdom as an exalted deed worthy of reward by Allah, by replacing the term 'a person giving away his soul to defend his homeland' with 'a person giving away his soul for the sake of Allah.' The nationalist message has been eliminated, to be replaced by an Islamic one: children are not told to sacrifice for the 'homeland' of Syria but to become, rather, martyrs for the sake of Allah. And what is to be done 'for the sake of Allah'? Sacrificing yourself to promote the spread of Islam, expanding the umma, and killing Infidels. Just like Dalia al-Mughrabi, who was killed during the Coastal Road Massacre, in which she helped to murder 38 Israeli civilians, including 13 children. Al-Mughrabi is in the new textbooks, held up as a model to be emulated. The main backer of al-Jolani’s rebel group HTS in its war against Assad was Erdogan’s Turkey. Turkey is still the main foreign backer of the new regime in Damascus, though there may later be a parting of the ways if Turkey insists on keeping a military presence in northern Syria to suppress the Kurds. But right now, Turkey is a friend, and the Ottomans need to be referred to without animus. Thus, the Ottoman 'occupation' mentioned in Assad-era textbooks has now become the Ottoman 'regime,' which is not pejorative but simply matter-of-fact. There is also no more emphasis on Syria itself, as was found in previous textbooks. Now the focus is squarely on Islam, and the worldwide umma. Statements against Jews remain, as do those against all the Western powers — warmongers and exploiters who suck the 'blood of the innocents.' Al-Jolani’s repeatedly expressed desire to focus only on Syria, making sure that all of its armed groups give up their weapons and become part of a national army, and his unwillingness to try to pressure Israel to withdraw from the territory it has just taken over on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, are reassuring. But then there are those new schoolbooks, just released, that have become even more Islamic in their contents, and that will influence the minds of Syrian children, whose Islam-infused curriculum will lead some of them inexorably to become jihadis themselves. The Israelis, who continue to hold back from responding to what some have taken to be overtures made by al-Jolani to the Jewish state, are right to do so. If you are wondering why, just look at what remains and what has been changed, for the worse, in the new textbooks now to be used in Syrian schools; Impact-se lays it all out.

First Jewish delegation in 33 years visits Damascus	During their visit the group toured the Jewish cemetery in Damascus, paying respects at the tomb of Rabbi Chaim Vital, according to Haredi Israeli news portal JDN. By Joshua Marks, JNS A delegation of Syrian-Jewish Americans toured Damascus on Tuesday, with approval from the transitional government that took power following the fall of the Assad regime in December. The visit, organized by the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a Washington-based advocacy group established in 2011 to support the then-Syrian opposition, included prominent figures such as Rabbi Yosef Hamra, a former leader of Syrian Jewry, and Rabbi Asher Lopatin, the director of Community Relations of Ann Arbor, Michigan’s Jewish Federation, alongside other Syrian Jews residing in the United States. Syrian Jews return to visit their homes in Damascus for the first time in decades. Facilitated by SETF, this latest delegation marks a new chapter for post-Assad Syria, one that welcomes all religions and sects. #Syria #syrianjews #syriajewishcommunity pic.twitter.com/7ebFMXRhUb &mdash; Syrian Emergency Task Force (@syrianetf) February 18, 2025 During their visit the group toured the Jewish cemetery in Damascus, paying respects at the tomb of Rabbi Chaim Vital, according to Haredi Israeli news portal JDN. They also visited historic Jewish sites, including the largely destroyed Jobar Synagogue, as well as the Al-Franj and Al-Raki synagogues and the Maimonides Jewish School. Hamra, who was forced to leave Syria in 1992, described his return to his homeland after 33 years as deeply emotional. He urged Jews in the West to visit Syria and see its changes for themselves, suggesting that some might even consider returning. His son, Henry, held up a Torah scroll alongside his father inside the Al-Franj Synagogue in the Jewish quarter in Old Damascus’ Bab Sharqi neighborhood. Founded by Sephardic Jews, it is the last synagogue in Syria used for worship by Jews. Henry Hamra told Reuters that Syria’s foreign ministry has pledged to protect Jewish heritage sites following a meeting with the deputy foreign minister. 'We need the government’s help, we need the government’s security and it’s going to happen,' he said. 'I want to see my kids come back and see this beautiful synagogue. It’s a work of art,' Henry added. Moaz Mustafa, head of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, emphasized the significance of this visit—the first Jewish delegation in 33 years—and underscored the new government’s support for the return of all Syrians. 'Very few Jews remain in Syria. We want the international community to help rebuild synagogues and lift sanctions on Syria,' he said, assuring Syrian Jews that 'your homeland is safe—you can return.' JNS reported in January that the chief rabbi of the Syrian Jewish community in Israel wrote to the new leader of Syria, congratulating him on his victory in ousting the Assad dictatorship and encouraging him to preserve the heritage sites of the country’s historic Jewish community. 'For thousands of years, the Jewish community in Syria, despite being a small minority, has been an integral part of the rich and diverse fabric of the Syrian people,' Rabbi Binyamin Hamra wrote to Ahmed al-Sharaa in the letter. 'Throughout Syria are historical sites, ancient synagogues, and tombs of great Jewish leaders, which constitute cultural and religious heritage for Jews throughout the world,' he wrote. Hamra’s father, Rabbi Avraham Hamra, served as the last chief rabbi of Syria from 1972 to 1992, before leaving for Israel via New York. A mass exodus of thousands of Jews from Syria was made possible after then-Syrian president Hafez al-Assad lifted a travel ban on the country’s historic Jewish community, leaving less than 10 Jews in the Syrian capital. Only two Jews, a brother and sister, remain in Syria today, according to Judy Feld Carr, a musicologist in Toronto who quietly rescued more than 3,000 Syrian Jews between 1977 and 2001. A study from Justice for Jews from Arab Countries (JJAC), a Jewish-American organization, published in December, puts the number of Jewish residents in Syria at four. According to the study, the value of property confiscated from Syria’s Jewish community exceeds $10 billion in contemporary terms.

GOP senators put Red Cross on notice after ‘neutral’ aid organiza...	During the hostages' time in captivity, the Red Cross did not fulfill its mandate to visit them and assess their health, as the group routinely does in traditional conflicts. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon When Hamas gunmen paraded emaciated Israeli hostages across a stage in Gaza earlier this month, they were flanked by two representatives from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), an aid group that boasts of its neutrality. The agency’s participation in the choreographed propaganda display—as well as its failure to visit the hostages as they struggled in captivity—is now drawing scrutiny on Capitol Hill, with GOP lawmakers questioning the Red Cross’s objectivity and care for those still held in captivity. The most shocking scene to date unfolded two weekends ago, when Hamas terrorists forced three severely malnourished Israeli captives—Ohad Ben Ami, 56; Eli Sharabi, 52; and Or Levy, 34—to make a speech to a crowd of Gazans before their release. Standing beside the masked gunmen were two Red Cross officials identified by the Washington Free Beacon as Nour Khadam and Stephanie Eller, both of whom have been featured in the ICRC's online materials. Footage from the hostage release shows Khadam shaking hands with a Hamas terrorist as Eller stands behind him, and a masked Hamas terrorist snaps photographs. Like other Red Cross officials present at these stage-managed events—reportedly produced by an Al Jazeera journalist—Eller and Khadam signed documents and stood on hand while the terror group forced the hostages to thank their captors. Photos taken on the day show the Israelis holding certificates provided by Hamas as they are interviewed next to gun-touting terrorists. The Red Cross's involvement in the Hamas propaganda ritual came more than a year after the terror group kidnapped 251 people, including Americans, in its Oct. 7 attack. During the hostages' time in captivity, the Red Cross did not fulfill its mandate to visit them and assess their health, as the group routinely does in traditional conflicts. The scenes have drawn outrage in both Israel and the United States, with President Donald Trump likening the hostages to 'Holocaust survivors' and casting doubt on the ceasefire’s durability. On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, lawmakers have taken note of the Red Cross’s participation in these ceremonies and said the aid agency is jeopardizing its image as an unbiased actor. While the United States has long been the committee's top funder, senior Senate sources say there is talk of reassessing American funding to the ICRC while GOP officials examine its ties to Hamas. 'Where was the Red Cross’s increasing concern for the safety and well-being of the hostages these last 493 days?' Sen. Ted Budd (R., N.C.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told the Free Beacon. 'Participating in Hamas’s propaganda ceremonies definitely calls into question their supposed neutrality. Seems like the ICRC is more concerned about their public image than actually fulfilling their mission to protect the lives and dignity of victims of armed conflict.' The pictures of starving hostages that have emerged over the past month, a senior Senate adviser said, raise serious questions about whether the Red Cross is living up to its lofty mandate. In its mission statement, the ICRC calls itself 'neutral, impartial, and independent,' a description that seemingly runs counter to images of Red Cross officials standing alongside Hamas terrorists. 'It’s shameful that the Red Cross is enabling propaganda of terrorists after they took no action over the last year to even visit the hostages,' the source said. 'Congress needs to reassess the U.S. relationship and stop any funding for any groups that have aided and abetted Hamas atrocities.' An ICRC spokesman defended the committee's hostage release conduct—and placed Israel and Hamas on a level playing field when doing so. 'The ICRC has unequivocally stated that release operations be conducted safely, privately, and with the dignity of the individual at the forefront,' the spokesman said. 'We remain concerned about the conditions and manner that [sic] all steps of all the release operations are being conducted.' 'We have repeatedly reminded the parties that core principles of international humanitarian law always apply, including and especially during release operations,' he continued. 'Additionally, we do not endorse the actions of any groups or individuals we engage with.' The Red Cross is not the only aid agency to come under the congressional microscope, though it is one of the most prominent and well-funded. Lawmakers have expressed broader concerns about an international network of nonprofits operating in the Gaza Strip, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which has employed scores of Hamas terrorists and produced educational materials calling for 'jihad' and reference the Israeli 'occupation.' Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced legislation in the last Congress that would allow American terrorism victims to sue international organizations that support Hamas and other regional terror outfits. While the bill, dubbed the LIABLE Act, was primarily aimed at UNRWA and the World Health Organization, it is broadly written and could allow for other nonprofits like the Red Cross to be held accountable in court. 'The left-wing NGO ecosystem is deeply complicit in Hamas’s terrorism and torture of hostages,' Cruz told the Free Beacon. 'Bizarrely, these organizations enjoy more immunity from lawsuits than even sovereign countries.' The senator said he intends to reintroduce his bill in the current Congress, where it is likely to garner broad support from Republican lawmakers and the Trump administration, which has already slashed U.S. funding to UNRWA while eyeing further cuts. In Israel, there is also a growing consensus that the Red Cross—like UNRWA—must be held accountable for its participation in Hamas’s propaganda displays. Arsen Ostrovsky, a human rights lawyer and CEO of International Legal Forum, explained that the Red Cross is largely protected from legal action due to its status as an aid group. But President Donald Trump could issue an executive order stripping the agency of this privilege. Congress could also do so legislatively. 'Aiding and abetting Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, while abandoning the hostages, including American nationals, is not only not fully aligned with the foreign policy of the president of the United States, but runs entirely counter to it,' Ostrovsky told the Free Beacon. 'The United States should defund the ICRC and instead use that money to help the hostage families of those whom the ICRC has abandoned, including American nationals.' Republicans have similarly targeted the ICRC in the past. In 2005, the Senate Republican Policy Committee issued a report calling on then-president George W. Bush to pull funding for the committee, arguing that the Geneva-based group has worked to 'reinterpret and expand international law' in a way that benefited terror organizations like the Taliban.

Israeli drone strike in Lebanon kills Hezbollah terrorist	The incident comes a day after the deadline for a full Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory per the terms of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Jerusalem and Beirut that went into effect on Nov. 27. By JNS An Israeli drone strike on a vehicle in Ayta al-Shaab in Southern Lebanon on Wednesday killed an armed Hezbollah terrorist operative, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed on Wednesday afternoon. 'Earlier today, an Air Force aircraft operated to eliminate a threat and eliminated a Hezbollah military operative in the Ayta al-Shaab area in Southern Lebanon who was seen handling weapons,' the IDF stated. The Israeli army 'continues to act to remove any threat in accordance with the understandings between Israel and Lebanon,' it added. One person was reportedly killed in a drone strike by #Israel on a car in the south Lebanon town of Ayta ash-Shab. The Saudi al-Hadath outlet reports that he was a #Hezbollah member. pic.twitter.com/p9Ba84NBj2 &mdash; Jason Brodsky (@JasonMBrodsky) February 19, 2025 The incident comes a day after the deadline for a full Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory per the terms of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Jerusalem and Beirut that went into effect on Nov. 27. On Monday, the Israel Defense Forces Northern Command confirmed that troops would remain deployed at five strategic outposts in Southern Lebanon. The IDF will continue to act against the Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorist group in Lebanon 'at full strength,' tweeted Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz on Tuesday morning. 'We will not allow a return to the reality of Oct. 7,' Katz declared, referring to the 2023 Hamas-led massacre in Israel’s south. 'Starting today, the IDF will remain in the buffer zone in Lebanon at five control posts along the border line, to ensure the protection of the northern communities,' he continued. Israel’s Kan News public broadcaster reported that the withdrawal from the rest of Southern Lebanon was completed ahead of the midnight deadline. IDF officials told the outlet overnight that 'the challenge is to preserve the [military] achievements and prevent Hezbollah from returning.' The IAF on Sunday evening conducted strikes on multiple Hezbollah sites in Lebanon housing rocket launchers and weapons, according to the Israeli military. An IAF strike in Southern Lebanon on Saturday night killed Hezbollah operative Abbas Ahmad Hamoud, who according to the Israeli military was responsible for overseeing the Iranian-backed terror group’s aerial force. Israel’s Army Radio reported on Monday that three instances of Hezbollah reconnaissance drones crossing into Israel in recent weeks were not disclosed to the public. According to the report, five surveillance drones were launched toward Israel from Lebanon, four of which managed to penetrate its airspace. However, only one UAV infiltration was publicly reported. According to the IDF, the other incidents were only confirmed to be real 'following an intelligence probe, and after about a week had passed.' 'The IDF reported every incident to the public when it was detected, in real time. The [security] systems identified dozens of incidents that turned out to be false,' the military told Army Radio. It was not immediately clear why the IDF did not report on the three successful drone infiltrations.

Hamas refuses disarmament, exile – but open to ceding Gaza	The terror group may see foregoing civilian governance as a different way to keep power. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told the Saudi Al Arabiya and Al Hadath channels earlier this week that 'Any future arrangement will be reached through national (Palestinian) consensus,' and that 'We do not cling to the rule of Gaza if that is in the interest of our people.' He then explained, 'There is no need for Hamas to be in Gaza's government in the future,' while adding, 'We have made concessions regarding the future of governance, but we have every right to remain part of the political landscape.' In the same report, Al Arabiya also cited a source 'familiar with the ceasefire negotiations' who added an important caveat to Hamas’ seeming willingness to forego power. The source said that Hamas renewed its commitment not to participate in the management of the Gaza Strip during the next phase, leaving wide open a future takeover of the coastal enclave. Pundits have also pointed out that it is possible that what lies behind Hamas outward flexibility is the realization that it would not necessarily be a bad thing to give up the civilian responsibilities of government, which includes providing its people with the basic necessities of life after a war that has devastated the Gaza Strip. It could then focus solely on rebuilding its military power and supplies over the coming years in order to continue trying to fulfill its charter and destroy Israel, without being distracted by the need to provide food, shelter, health care and the like to the civilian population. On Tuesday, Qassem doubled down, stating that Israel’s demand to force out the terror group from coastal enclave and keep the area permanently weapons-free was 'silly psychological warfare,' adding, 'The removal of the resistance from Gaza or its disarmament is unacceptable.' Egypt had reportedly put heavy pressure on Hamas to agree to relinquish control to the Palestinian Authority. However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated an oft-stated mantra of his on the day after Qassem’s interview, saying that 'there will be neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority' ruling Gaza after the war ends. Instead, he was 'committed' to U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan 'to create a different Gaza.' Israel’s government has enthusiastically backed Trump’s idea to have other countries absorb the Gazan population while the U.S. 'takes over' the coastal enclave and rebuilds it to become a Hamas-free 'Riviera of the Middle East.' Defense Minister Yisrael Katz ordered Monday the establishment of a new directorate within his ministry that will provide 'extensive assistance' to Palestinians who would like to emigrate from Gaza. While much of the Arab world and part of Europe has slammed the idea, insisting that the Gazans must stay put and enjoy no freedom of movement, a poll published by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research last June found that even before the war, almost a third (31%) of Gazans thought of emigrating, with the number rising to 44% among those of prime fighting age, 18-29. Most wanted to leave for economic motives, with 'political' reasons coming second, 'educational opportunities' third, and security and corruption rounding out the top five. It would seemingly be easy to predict that these numbers would only rise if the survey was retaken now, with perhaps only the order of the motives changing somewhat. The poll showed that the respondents’ preferred destinations were Turkey, Germany, Canada, the United States, and Qatar, in that order.

Israel conditioning continuation of ceasefire on removal of Hamas...	Israeli government reportedly conditioning implementation of second phase of Gaza deal on Hamas agreeing to disarm and leave Gaza Strip and exclusion of Palestinian Authority from involvement in post-war Gaza administration. By World Israel News Staff Israel is conditioning the implementation of the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal on Hamas’ willingness to disarm and to leave the Gaza Strip, according to a report by Channel 12. The report, broadcast on Tuesday night following a meeting of Israel’s security cabinet a day earlier, claimed that during the security cabinet’s deliberations, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told ministers that Israel has a firm set of conditions heading into the latest around of talks in Doha, Qatar. The news comes as Netanyahu replaces the head of the Israeli negotiating team, swapping Mossad chief David Barnea with Strategic Affairs Minister and former Ambassador to the U.S. Ron Dermer, a long-time Netanyahu loyalist. According to Tuesday night’s report, Netanyahu told cabinet ministers that in the upcoming Doha talks, Dermer will insist that Hamas disarm, and that the terrorist group withdraw from Gaza, with the movement’s leadership going into exile. A report by national broadcaster Kan echoed this claim, stating that Netanyahu has conditioned the implementation of the second phase of the hostage deal on the total demilitarization of the Gaza Strip. In addition, Channel 12 reported, Israel is demanding that a deal to implement phase two of the ceasefire include a provision excluding the Palestinian Authority from any role in the post-war management of the Gaza Strip. On Tuesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar (New Hope) said Israel would 'not accept the continued presence of Hamas or any other terrorist organization in Gaza.' However, Sa’ar continued, 'if we will see there is a constructive dialogue with a possible horizon of getting to an agreement then we will make this timeframe work longer.'

More than 50 NY rabbis implore Eric Adams and Kathy Hochul to opp...	The letter calls on the mayor and governor to 'restrict' illegal immigration raids in schools and houses of worship, which are now permitted under new federal guidelines. By Ben Sales, JTA More than 50 rabbis and cantors, including leaders of some of New York City’s most prominent synagogues, signed an open letter Tuesday asking Mayor Eric Adams and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul to protect illegal immigrants from the Trump administration’s planned mass deportations. The letter, the latest in a succession of recent statements by Jewish leaders opposing President Donald Trump’s policies, comes at an unprecedentedly fraught time in the politics of New York City and the state. The Trump administration has moved to drop corruption charges against Adams so that he will be able to help the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigrants. The arrangement has led to a cascade of resignations at top levels of city government and beyond along with mounting calls for Adams to resign — which he has rebuffed. And relations between Hochul and Adams aren’t exactly tranquil. The evening before the rabbis’ letter was published, Hochul said she would be meeting with 'key leaders' to discuss taking the step of removing Adams from office, which no governor has ever done in the state’s history. Against that backdrop, the letter asks Adams and Hochul 'to be the leaders we desperately need at this moment, and do all you can to resist Trump’s terrifying anti-immigrant agenda.' It does not reference the controversy surrounding Adams. The letter calls on the mayor and governor to 'restrict' illegal immigration raids in schools and houses of worship, which are now permitted under new federal guidelines. It also calls on the leaders to refrain from sharing information with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and to not use jails to detain immigrants. 'We also know in our bones and from our modern history the danger of an unchecked xenophobic government scapegoating ‘outsiders’ to gain power, preying on a population experiencing hard economic times to gain support for a violent and destructive agenda,' the letter said. 'We will not stand by while history repeats itself. You, our state and local leaders, must not either.' The letter follows others signed by Jewish leaders or organizations opposing Trump’s or Republicans’ policies on transgender athletes, mass deportations, Gaza, and diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI. Jewish groups have also joined lawsuits challenging Trump’s immigration actions. The letters signatories hail from the Reform, Conservative and Reconstructionist movements, and include leaders of large synagogues such as Temple Emanu-El, B’nai Jeshurun, Ansche Chesed, Congregation Beth Elohim, Forest Hills Jewish Center, Congregation Beit Simchat Torah, Society for the Advancement of Judaism and others. Not all rabbis who signed appended the names of their synagogues. The letter was organized by a consortium of progressive Jewish groups in the city, including Bend the Arc, the Jewish refugee aid group HIAS, Jews For Racial & Economic Justice, New York Jewish Agenda, the immigration advocacy group Never Again Action, the liberal rabbinic human rights group T’ruah and The Workers Circle.

A closer look at the six hostages to be released on Saturday	The ongoing first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for up to 1,904 Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli officials confirmed that Hamas will release six hostages on Saturday as the terror group seeks to expedite the handovers of the ceasefire’s first phase. The captives expected to be freed are Tal Shoham, Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen, Avera Mengistu, and Hisham Al-Sayed. Their return will come on the heels of the return of four bodies on Thursday. Here’s a look at the six living hostages Hamas said will be freed on Saturday. Two, both suffering from mental illness, have been held captive since entering Gaza on their own in 2014 and 2015. Avera Mengistu, now 37, entered Gaza on Sept. 17, 2014. Soldiers manning security cameras spotted Mengistu but failed to stop him before he managed to cross the fence and was caught by a Hamas patrol. An Ethiopian-Israeli who lived in Ashkelon, Mengistu suffers from schizophrenia and stopped taking his medicine around the time he disappeared. His last sign of life was in a propaganda video released by Hamas in 2023. According to the Hostage Families Forum, the Ethiopian-Israeli will have spent 3,821 days in captivity. Hisham al Sayed, now 37, was diagnosed with acute psychotic disorder and schizophrenia and suffered from auditory hallucinations. A resident of the Bedouin village of Hura, Sayed entered Gaza through the Erez Crossing on April 20, 2015. Sayed’s last sign of life was in a Hamas propaganda video in 2022 which showed him lying in a bed with an oxygen mask and IV drip. According to the Hostage Families Forum, Sayed will have spent 3,596 days in captivity. Elya Cohen, now 27, was abducted from the Nova Music Festival on the morning of October 7. Cohen and his fiance, Ziv Aboud, were shot while trying to flee the attack. Aboud said they were hiding in a shelter among dead bodies when terrorists lifted Cohen out and took him to Gaza. Other hostages freed in recent weeks told Cohen’s family they saw him chained and that he gets very little food or daylight. Tal Shoham, now 39, is a dual Israeli-Austrian national who was visiting family at Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7. He was taken captive along with his wife, Adi, their two daughters ages three and eight, and three other relatives, who were all freed during the temporary ceasefire of November 2023. Omer Wenkert, now 23, was abducted from the Nova Music Festival. Liam Or, who was released in November 2023, told the Wenkert family she was held captive together with Elya who she described as dangerously underweight. Wenkert suffers from colitis. Omer Shem-Tov, a computer programmer, now 22, was abducted from the Nova Music Festival. The last sign of life was in a Hamas video, but little else is known about his condition. The ongoing first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for up to 1,904 Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. The exact number will depend on how Israeli captives are alive. Hamas notified Israeli authorities in January that of the 33, eight are dead, but offered no evidence. Since the first hostage release on Jan. 19, Hamas has freed 19 Israeli and five Thai captives in exchange for 952 imprisoned Palestinian terrorists. The fate of the remaining 65 hostages will be determined by negotiations during the ceasefire’s second phase. Critics say the phased approach condemns these 65 hostages to open-ended captivity and undermines Israel’s war gains. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 73 remaining hostages, more than 30 are believed to be dead.

Tech entrepreneur Palmer Luckey calls himself a ‘radical Zionist’...	Luckey also dismissed the 'slippery slope' argument that validating Israel’s existence could lead to a surge in the formation of ethno-states for other groups, calling such hypothetical scenarios 'absurd' reasons to oppose the Jewish state. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner Prominent tech entrepreneur Palmer Luckey referred to himself as a 'radical Zionist' while vigorously defending Israel’s right to existence during a new interview on the podcast the 'Shawn Ryan Show.' During the sit-down, Luckey reminisced about his 2017 firing from Facebook, allegedly over his support for US President Donald Trump. Luckey, founder of the defense tech company Anduril Industries, rejected the 'lockstep narrative' presented by the media that he is 'racist' or 'sexist,' pointing toward his strong support for Israel as an example of his support for minority groups. 'I’m actually a radical Zionist,' Luckey said. When asked by Ryan to elaborate on what he meant, Luckey explained that Jews have the right to maintain a state for their own self-defense. He argued that the Holocaust proved the need for a Jewish state, and without it Jews are at risk of facing violence. 'I strongly believe in the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state. People are like, That’s so problematic, though. It’s so ethnostate adjacent.’ I said, ‘I don’t care,'' Luckey said. 'After what happened to them in World War II, they deserve a place where they can do their own thing and protect their own people without getting wrecked by everybody else who hates them.' Luckey also dismissed the 'slippery slope' argument that validating Israel’s existence could lead to a surge in the formation of ethno-states for other groups, calling such hypothetical scenarios 'absurd' reasons to oppose the Jewish state. He argued that it is 'very reasonable for the Jews to have their own state' and that the potential formation of a Palestinian state should be treated as 'a separate political issue.' Palmer Luckey explains what a radical zionist is.@PalmerLuckey pic.twitter.com/dv3PP3vhfr — Shawn Ryan Show (@ShawnRyanShow) February 16, 2025 All minority groups in Israel, including the Arabs who comprise about 20 percent of the Israeli population, enjoy the full and equal rights of the country’s democratic system, including the ability to serve in parliament and the judiciary. Meanwhile, Jews and other minority groups, including Christians among others, have faced intense discrimination in other parts of the Middle East. In the Palestinian-governed Judea and Samaria, for example, Palestinians are prohibited from selling land directly to Jewish Israelis. Luckey has stated his support for Israel several times. Following the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas’s invasion of and massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the tech entrepreneur lambasted prominent American individuals and institutions for not standing behind the Jewish state. 'Israel has my [and our] unqualified support,' Luckey said at the Wall Street Journal‘s Tech Live Conference in October of 2023. 'What’s happening in Israel is just another instance of the same type of evil that’s been going on for a very long time,' he added. 'And I think it reflects very poorly on our billionaire class that you’re not seeing a whole-of-country effort to become involved and to speak up about these issues, hedging on condemnation of Hamas for fear of saying the wrong thing, either in the court of public opinion or because it hurts their business interests.'

75% of Israeli Jews back Trump’s Gaza plan	Just 18% of Israeli Jews back Palestinian statehood, compared to 75% who oppose establishment of Palestinian state, even a demilitarized one. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The vast majority of Israeli Jews back President Donald Trump's plan to resettle the entire population of the Gaza Strip abroad, according to a new poll. The survey was conducted by the Lazar Research Institute between February 11th and the 13th, with a sample size of 700 Israeli Jews and Arabs, ages 18 to 65. The poll was published Tuesday by the Jerusalem Center for Foreign Affairs. The study found little support for Palestinian statehood among Israel's Jewish population, with 75% of respondents saying they would not support establishing a Palestinian state - even a demilitarized on. Just 2% of Jewish Israelis said they would back Palestinian statehood without conditions, while 16% said they would support the establishment of a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes Israel as a Jewish state. Most Arab-Israelis, however, say they support Palestinian statehood along the pre-1967 lines, with just 16% opposing the establishment of such a state. Arab-Israelis were also more likely to say that Hamas should remain in the Gaza Strip as a 'civil body' after the current war with Israel. Just 4% of Jews agreed that Hamas should retain its civil administration role in Gaza, compared to 27% of Arab-Israelis. Nineteen percent of Arab-Israelis even say that Hamas should remain the 'ruling military body' in Gaza after the war, compared to 3% of Jews who held the same opinion. Two-thirds (66%) of Israeli Jews said the Palestinian Authority should not be given a role in the post-war governance of Gaza, while 44% of Arab-Israelis said it should be given a role. Three-quarters (75%) of Israeli Jews say they support Trump's plan to resettle all of Gaza's population in third-party countries, while 58% of Arab-Israelis oppose the proposal. Nearly three-quarters (71%) of the total Israeli population (Jewish and Arab) back the IDF establishing long-term buffer zones in southern Lebanon, Syria, and Gaza. Nearly two-thirds (61%) of all Israelis back military action against Iran's nuclear program. Of those, 38% say Israel should coordinate such an attack with the U.S., while 23% say Israel should carry out the attack unilaterally, without consulting the U.S. A total of 68% of Israeli Jews believe that a terrorist massacre, similar to those which took place in southwestern Israel on October 7th, 2023, could be carried out by Palestinian terrorists in Judea and Samaria. Just 25% of Arab-Israelis say they concerned about such a scenario.

Israeli authorities raid multiple UNRWA facilities in Jerusalem	Israel has said that UNRWA, the U.N. aid agency for Palestinians, has been so thoroughly penetrated by Hamas and other terrorist groups that it is essentially itself a terrorist enterprise. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, Canaan Lidor, JNS Jerusalem city inspectors accompanied by police entered several facilities on Tuesday in eastern Jerusalem of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), whose activity is illegal in Israel, according to laws that went into effect last month. Aryeh King, the deputy mayor of Jerusalem, said in a statement that for the first time since the establishment of the modern-day State of Israel, 'the Israeli government and the Jerusalem Municipality entered a compound owned by the KKL-Jewish National Fund, which UNRWA has been using without permission. Instead of serving as a Nazi base of operations, the 80-dunam [20 acre] complex will be used for Jerusalem Municipality facilities.' King was referring to UNRWA’s so-called Kalandia Training Center, Channel 14 reported, adding that it has been seized and that Border Police officers responded with crowd-dispersal means to rioting at the site during the raid. Additional raids occurred in the Nahal Ha-Egoz neighborhood and Kfar Hashiloach, the Hamas-affiliated Shehab News Agency reported. Another facility was raided in Kfar Akev, near the training center. A police spokesperson told JNS that the officers provided security for municipal inspectors and employees carrying out their missions. Israel has said that UNRWA, the U.N. aid agency for Palestinians, has been so thoroughly penetrated by Hamas and other terrorist groups that it is essentially itself a terrorist enterprise. UNRWA has denied this, but following the discovery of evidence linking dozens of UNRWA staff and facilities to the Hamas-led massacre of 1,200 people in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the Knesset banned its activity in Israel and outlawed any contact between officials and UNRWA representatives. Authorities closed down two main offices of UNRWA in Jerusalem, prompting the group’s senior management to leave Israel, in addition to Judea and Samaria. Still, more than two weeks after the laws went into effect, UNRWA facilities were operational in eastern Jerusalem, Kan News reported on Monday. The reports led to criticism of a failure to enforce the laws, including by human-rights activist Shai Glick of the B’Tsalmo group, who threatened to show up at the illegally operating UNRWA facilities. The Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has 'ordered the immediate implementation of the UNRWA law, which was passed in the Knesset with broad support. There are no restrictions on implementing the Prime Minister’s directive.' The cabinet minister responsible for Jerusalem, Meir Porush, said: 'I welcome the Prime Minister’s directive to immediately enforce the law to remove UNRWA from Jerusalem. There is no place for U.N. supporters of terrorism in our city.' His ministry, 'together with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health and the Jerusalem Municipality, are prepared with all alternatives to the services provided by UNRWA in eastern Jerusalem.'

‘Days of heartbreak’: Israel prepares to receive fallen hostages	The forensic identification process will take several hours and include imaging scans, DNA sample analyses, and comparisons with existing medical records, such as dental X-rays. By Maytal Yasur Beit-Or, JNS On Thursday, Israel is set to enter a new and highly sensitive stage in the hostage release negotiations. For the first time since Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas is expected to return the bodies of hostages. The Israeli healthcare system and the National Center of Forensic Medicine are preparing to receive the fallen, while mental health organizations are gearing up to address the emotional impact on the families and the public. The Red Cross will take custody of the bodies from Hamas at a designated transfer point and hand them over to the Israel Defense Forces. They will then be airlifted to the National Center of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv, where experts will conduct examinations to confirm identification and attempt to determine the cause and time of death. The forensic identification process will include imaging scans, DNA sample analyses and comparisons with existing medical records, such as dental X-rays. This process is expected to take several hours. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of many of the captives, has urged the public to refrain from spreading rumors and to avoid contacting the families regarding the matter. 'An emotional roller coaster' Throughout the war, the forensic institute has received the bodies of hostages recovered from Gaza during military operations. In the early months of the conflict, the IDF’s rabbinical unit operated a special identification center at the Shura military base. 'We are bracing for the heartbreak we know awaits us in the coming days. This period has been an emotional roller coaster,' said Dr. Shiri Daniels of the ERAN mental health support organization, which provides assistance via phone and online. 'We experience moments of relief alongside deep loss and mourning. This is a prolonged national trauma,' she added. Since the war began, ERAN has handled 437,856 calls and is preparing to expand its support lines. David Koren, ERAN’s CEO, warns of the emotional toll: 'We don’t know what we’re about to witness. This situation is drawing people from multiple circles of connection—direct and indirect—to seek mental health support. There is no precedent for an event of this scale.' Dr. Einat Yahna, head of rehabilitation at the Hostage and Missing Families Forum’s health division, explains that the release of hostages triggers intense reactions: 'For families whose loved ones are not on the release list, for families of the fallen hostages, and even for those who have already buried their loved ones, each development is another emotional upheaval. 'The hostages who returned alive brought signs of life [of other captives], which sparked both joy and anxiety among families still waiting for news. These families live in a constant state of uncertainty. On one hand, the signs of life provided a glimmer of hope, but on the other, they increased the anxiety level. Some families, whose loved ones have not been declared dead, are living in deep fear. We’ve learned that even the process of receiving tragic news is deeply unsettling and unclear, unlike the standard military protocol for handling loss.' Coping mechanisms The psychological impact may manifest in physical, emotional and cognitive symptoms, including difficulty concentrating, irritability, confusion, sleep disturbances, headaches and muscle tension. 'There’s no single right way to cope with loss and death,' said Daniels. 'On one hand, avoiding the subject entirely comes with emotional costs. On the other, it is important not to become consumed by grief.' Regarding children and teenagers, experts recommend discussing the situation with them before they encounter distressing footage. 'It’s crucial to provide age-appropriate information,' said Daniels. 'Tell them that difficult images and reports are expected and that they do not have to watch every video sent to them. Encourage them to express their thoughts and feelings, while avoiding dismissive comments that undermine their fear or sadness.' Dr. Yahna concluded: 'The coming days will be incredibly difficult. We must rise above the immediate pain and understand that this is a necessary step toward closing the collective trauma of the hostage crisis. Only certainty can help move from paralysis to healing.'

Hamas offers to release all remaining hostages in single swap	Hamas officials pushing for a comprehensive, all-or-nothing approach to talks for the implementation of the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire, offering to release all remaining Israeli hostages in one shot - while demanding an end to the war a full IDF withdrawal. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization has offered to release all remaining Israeli hostages - both dead and alive - together in a single large exchange, a senior spokesman for the terror group announced Tuesday night. Khalil al-Hayya, the acting chairman of Hamas' politburo, announced Tuesday that the terror group is slated to return 10 Israeli hostages, including 6 living captives and the remains of four dead hostages, this week, in two exchanges. The first, set for Thursday, will include the four dead captives, while the second, including the six living captives, is slated for Saturday. Al-Hayya said the move demonstrated Hamas' commitment to the hostage deal and the group's willingness to move forward with the implementation of the second phase of the deal. 'We highlight the need of the occupation to implement all instructions of the deal without delay,' al-Hayya said. The Hamas leader added that in order to move forward with the return of the remains of dead hostages, his group would need bulldozers and other heavy equipment to remove debris in the war-torn Gaza Strip. 'We demand that heavy equipment to extract bodies including of hostages who were killed in Israeli bombing,' al-Hayya said. Al-Hayya called for a comprehensive deal between Hamas and Israel to end the war in Gaza permanently, return the remaining Israeli hostages, and remove Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip. 'We are prepared to immediately move to the next phase that includes a complete cease-fire and withdrawal of the military.' A second senior Hamas official, Hazem Qassem, echoed al-Hayya's comments, saying Tuesday night that in the second phase of the deal, Hamas would release remaining hostages in a single exchange - on condition that Israel agrees to pull out of Gaza. Qassem added that Hamas would not agree to leave Gaza or to disarm, though it does not rule out ceding control to another Palestinian entity.

Gaza terrorist who held Israelis captive to be released in hostag...	Details regarding the identities of the terrorists slated for release under the hostage deal reportedly concealed from ministers. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Cabinet ministers were not informed of certain details of the Palestinian prisoner release to be effected this week in exchange for four bodies and six live hostages, i24 News reported Tuesday. The agreement with Hamas that the Cabinet approved stated that no one would be freed who were involved in the terrorists’ slaughter of 1,200 and abduction of 251 people during their invasion of Israel on October 7, 2023. Those who fought against the IDF over the 15 months of war in Gaza were also ruled out. However, reporter Avishai Grinzaig said that among the 1,000 security prisoners who will be freed, which includes all females and those up to age 19 arrested by IDF forces in Gaza since October 7, is also a woman known to have held hostages captive. Others include those who have launched rockets in previous rounds of fighting with Israel, were involved in digging terror tunnels, and Hamas members and officials whom Israel has not proven to have taken part in the current war. Out of the 1,000 detainees, Hamas selected 500 names and Israel selected the other 500 to be released. Grinzaig said that a minister had claimed to him that 'These details were not clearly presented in the Cabinet meeting,' and that they didn’t know about it. According to Israel National News, Hamas was not given a completely free choice about who could be released. Israeli officials gave the terrorist organization a list of names that had already been previously approved by the government, the media outlet said. The January agreement had reportedly stated that a list of 400 Palestinians arrested since October 7 would be forwarded every Sunday to Hamas during the first phase. This included 250-300 terrorists who are serving life sentences for the murder of many Israelis, and hundreds more who were sentenced to up to 20 years in prison for their roles in committing terror attacks. Hamas has announced that three of the four murdered hostages to be released Thursday are Shiri Bibas and her two young children, Ariel and Kfir, who were four and nine months old when the terrorists dragged them into Gaza from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. The father of the family, Yarden, was released from Hamas captivity on February 1. Hamas did not publicly name the fourth body. Israeli officials have said that positive identification will made by forensic specialists on all the bodies before the affected families are officially informed, and only then will the information be made public.

Hostages held for over a decade slated to come home Saturday	Avera Mengistu, 38, and Hisham al-Sayyed, 37, to be released on Saturday, alongside four other Israeli captives. By World Israel News Staff Two Israeli hostages held in captivity by the Hamas terror group for more than ten years are expected to be released in the coming days, alongside an additional four Israelis kidnapped on October 7th. The Israeli government officially confirmed that Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayyed are slated for release this Saturday. Both Mengistu, now 38, and al-Sayyed, now 37, suffer from mental health issues, and entered the Strip of their own accord in two separate incidents in 2014 and 2015. Mengistu's 'parents, brothers, and sisters will travel to greet him,' a relative, Gil Elias, told Hebrew-language outlet Ynet. 'This is joyful and surprising news that we have been waiting for for more than 10 years,' Elias added. 'We are eagerly waiting for him to arrive, I want to see him walk out of there on his own two feet, with a smile,' he said. In a media statement, al-Sayyed's family said that while they are thrilled about his upcoming release, they empathize with the families of the hostages who will not be returned during this phase of the deal. 'Our Hisham will return home&#8230;but the good news about his expected return will not be complete until all the abductees return to their homes,' the family said. 'The ceasefire and hostage deal agreement must not be allowed to fail, and the fate of additional abductees must not be a decade in captivity.' Al-Sayyed, a Bedouin-Israel, briefly served in the Israeli army, but was discharged due to his mental health issues. His father, also named Hisham, told Ynet that he had reached out to the families of those kidnapped on October 7th, as he understands their anguish. 'I visit some of the families, we try to be in touch with all of them,' he said. 'They are from all sides of the political spectrums. We are in touch with families and not aligned with any political platform or movement.'

UN official demands Israel, US pay reparations to Gaza	United Nations special rapporteur Francesca Albanese demands Israel and the United States prepare to pay reparations to Gaza, claiming both are liable under international law. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A senior United Nations official is demanding the United States and Israel pay war reparations to the Gaza Strip and to the Palestinian Authority, claiming both countries are liable under international law. On Sunday, United Nations Special Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories Francesca Albanese posted on her X/Twitter account that Israel's war against the Hamas terror organization in Gaza and its counter-terror operations in Judea and Samaria constitute a 'genocidal assault' against Palestinian Arabs. Furthermore, she argued, Israel is liable for war reparations to Gaza and the Palestinian people at large. The United States, too, must 'make plans to offer reparations' due to its role in arming the Israeli military. 'It is about time that Israel and the US - and those who enabled and armed the genocidal assault against the Palestinians - make plans to offer REPARATIONS to the Palestinian people to rebuild Gaza, as prescribed by international law,' Albanese wrote. The Italian human rights attorney also lambasted President Donald Trump's plan to resettle the population of Gaza abroad and to place the enclave under American control. 'HOW to rebuild Gaza, much of the West Bank and east Jerusalem, is up to the Palestinians. PS. Riviera plan does not count as reparation; rather as a rapacious attempt to continue to commit crimes in Palestine.' Since her tenure as Special Rapporteur began in 2022, Albanese has repeatedly become embroiled in controversies over her comments on Israel, on Jews and the 'Jewish lobby,' and strong support for the Palestinian cause and refusal to condemn deadly attacks on Israelis. According to a report last month by the Jewish Insider, Albanese's behavior has even drawn criticism from within the United Nations' leadership, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres privately telling American Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism Deborah Lipstadt that Albanese is a 'horrible person.' Guterres reportedly used that phrase twice to describe Albanese during his talk with Lipstadt at a Munich Security Conference. In the past, Albanese has compared Israelis to Nazis, claimed the 'Jewish lobby' has subjugated the United States, and justified Hamas invasion and massacres of October 7th, 2023, saying the Israeli victims were 'not killed because of their Judaism but in response to Israel's oppression.'

Iran threatens fresh missile attack on Israel ‘in due time’	IRGC deputy commander-in-chief says Iran will attack Israel with ballistic missiles for a third time, in the near future. By World Israel News Staff A senior Iranian military official pledged a third round of ballistic missile strikes on Israel, saying that the attack would occur in the near future. Deputy IRGC commander-in-chief Brigadier General Ali Fadavi said while speaking at a conference on Monday that 'True Promise III will be carried out in due time.' Fadavi claimed that Israel had suffered a crushing defeat in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which was launched following the October 7th massacre. 'Zionist regime officials themselves admit that Hamas won and they lost,' Fadavi said. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that after battling Iranian proxy groups, including Hezbollah, Jerusalem 'can and will finish the job' fighting Iran's 'axis of terror.' In response, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei sniped that Israel 'cannot do a damn thing' to seriously damage Iran. The exchange came on the heels of reports that Israel is planning a strike on Iran's nuclear facilities later this year. After a massive weapons shipment from the U.S. was delivered to Israel, which was previously held up by the Biden administration, speculation has grown that an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear assets is imminent. 'If the Zionist entity attacks our nuclear facilities, we will respond in kind. I do not believe they would take such a reckless step, as they know well how we would react,' Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Arabic-language outlet Al Mayadeen . In November, shortly after Israel destroyed critical air defense systems following Iran's second attack on Israel, 'Responding to the Zionist entity’s attack is inevitable and certain,' Araghchi said to the outlet at the time. 'However, the circumstances, timing, and form of this response will be determined based on the appropriate conditions.'

Jewish groups urge Knesset to press UN on Hamas sexual crimes	The UN has yet to list Hamas as a party accused of committing rape in armed conflict or hold the terrorist organization accountable for these crimes against humanity. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A delegation of Jewish groups urged the Knesset to pressure the UN to hold Hamas accountable for its sexual crimes committed since October 7th, 2023. The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations addressed a special Knesset session on Monday. Carol Ann Schwartz, National President of World Hadassah, highlighted the global effort to seek justice for victims of Hamas's sexual violence. 'We were outraged by Hamas’ brutal October 7, 2023, attack on Israel and the reports of widespread weaponization of sexual violence,' she said. 'Over the past year, the war has deeply affected women in personal ways. We met with UN leaders and mobilized over 150,000 grassroots signatures from nearly 120 countries, in addition to collaborating with 120 organizations, to demand that the United Nations take action and hold Hamas accountable.' She continued, 'The UN has yet to list Hamas as a party accused of committing rape in armed conflict or hold the terrorist organization accountable for these crimes against humanity. We will not give up. Sexual violence in conflict is increasing worldwide, and accountability is crucial to preventing future atrocities.' Meredith Jacobs, CEO of Jewish Women International and Co-Founder, spoke about the profound impact sexual violence has on women and how Israelis and Jewish women are being excluded from the conversation, especially on college campuses. 'The effects of dehumanization, objectification, and hate are playing out on our campuses and beyond. Jewish survivors of sexual violence no longer feel safe seeking help from mainstream agencies,' she said. 'Those of us in the field have lost colleagues, and women’s studies programs at universities across the United States are teaching that Israel is weaponizing feminism and that Zionists are not to be trusted.' Sheila Katz, CEO of the National Council of Jewish Women, emphasized the urgency of breaking the silence surrounding Hamas’ crimes: 'Rape is a violation of humanity. It must never be normalized—not in our cities, not on our campuses, and not as a weapon of war. But silence, in itself, normalizes rape.'

Sa’ar: Israel to start Phase 2 talks with Hamas	As part of Phase 2, Jerusalem will reportedly demand the release of all hostages in addition to the expulsion of the Hamas leadership from Gaza and the dismantling of its terrorist army. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar told reporters on Tuesday that Jerusalem decided to start talks on Phase 2 of the ongoing hostage release and ceasefire agreement with Hamas. 'We had a Security Cabinet meeting last night. We decided to open negotiations on the second phase,' Jerusalem’s top diplomat said during a briefing for journalists at the Foreign Ministry. As part of the talks set to begin later this week, the Israeli government will demand the complete disarmament of Iranian-backed Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist organizations in Gaza, the minister stressed. A 'Hezbollah model' in which Hamas retains its 'military' capabilities is unacceptable for Israel, 'and therefore we need a total demilitarization of Gaza and no presence of the Palestinian Authority,' stated Sa’ar. Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari told reporters in Doha earlier on Tuesday that 'there is a positive atmosphere regarding the second phase of the agreement.' He added, 'The arrival of the delegations depends on the decisions of the parties involved.' Jerusalem’s negotiating teams in Egypt and Qatar have so far focused only on the implementation of the current Phase 1 of the Gaza truce. An Israeli political source cited by Ynet on Tuesday said that Jerusalem was making 'great efforts to release all six remaining living hostages in the first phase, as well as four hostages who are no longer alive.' Hebrew media reported on Monday that Israel this week is seeking the freedom of six instead of three living hostages during the upcoming seventh release. Under the terms of the deal, Hamas is also expected to release on Thursday the bodies of four captives murdered in Gaza. In exchange for releasing the three additional living hostages, the Israeli government has reportedly signaled its willingness to allow the entry of hundreds of additional caravans for the reconstruction of the Strip. The Israeli official told Ynet on Tuesday, 'In the outline for the release of the hostages, Israel has committed to bringing caravans and mechanical engineering equipment into the Gaza Strip following strict inspection. As part of the negotiations, and subject to Hamas’s compliance with the deal, Israel will begin to allow this in a controlled and gradual manner.' The first 42-day phase of the deal with Hamas is set to end on March 1. On Monday, the Security Cabinet met to formulate 'instructions for the continuation of the negotiations regarding the second stage,' according to an official statement from the Prime Minister’s Office. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is working in 'full cooperation and coordination' with the U.S. administration on the next phase of the ceasefire, he emphasized during a joint press conference with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jerusalem on Sunday. 'We have a shared strategy, which cannot always be detailed to the public—including when the gates of hell will open. And they will open if all our hostages are not returned, every last one of them,' he stressed. Netanyahu’s remark was a reference to Trump’s warning that the 'gates of hell' could be unleashed if Hamas does not release all of the hostages. As part of Phase 2, Jerusalem will reportedly demand the release of all hostages in addition to the expulsion of the Hamas leadership from Gaza and the dismantling of its terrorist army. Officials in Jerusalem believe that the terror organization is likely to reject the demands. U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News on Sunday that second-phase talks would take place this week 'at a location to be determined.' Witkoff noted he already had 'very productive and constructive' talks on Sunday with Netanyahu, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and the head of Egypt’s General Intelligence. He said they spoke about 'the sequencing of Phase 2, setting forth positions on both sides, so we can understand … where we are today, and then continuing talks this week at a location to be determined so that we can figure out how we get to the end of Phase 2 successfully.'

Released Palestinian terrorist leaves prison with $633,000	The Palestinian Authority (PA) allocates around $279 million annually to pay salaries to security prisoners in Israeli prisons, which range from $400-$3,400 per month, depending on the sentence. By Anna Epshtein, TPS Ahmed Barghouti, who masterminded suicide bombing attacks which killed twelve Israelis, walked out of an Israeli prison on Saturday afternoon with more than 1.2 million shekels ($338,00) in his bank account, courtesy Palestinian Authority stipends that Israelis refer to as 'pay for slay.' Similar sums awaited Mansour Shreim and Ahmed Abu Khader. The latter was member of the Palestinian Authority security forces who trained terrorists for suicide missions and carried out shooting attacks. Shreim dispatched terrorists who killed nine Israeli teenagers in separate attacks in 2002. 'The Palestinian Authority pays salaries to the terrorists while they are in Israeli prisons. It is not to support their families – it is actually to reward them for what they did,' Itamar Marcus, head of Palestinian Media Watch, told The Press Service of Israel. 'The money is accumulated in the private account of the given terrorist, that is being opened for him immediately after he enters a prison.' The Palestinian Authority (PA) allocates around $279 million annually to pay salaries to security prisoners in Israeli prisons, which range from $400-$3,400 per month, depending on the sentence. For comparison, PA welfare benefits to ordinary Palestinians range from $60-$170 per month depending on need. Those who participated in terror attacks killing Israelis — thus receiving the most severe sentences — got the highest payouts. The Palestinian Authority allocates seven percent of its annual budget for its so-called 'Martyr’s Fund,' which provides stipends to Palestinian terrorists in Israeli prisons, and the families of terrorists killed in attacks. Israeli officials say the stipends provide incentives for terror and regularly offset an equivalent amount from taxes that Israel collects on behalf of the PA. According to Palestinian Media Watch, the total amount of money that awaits the terrorists released as part of the current ceasefire deal with Hamas is around $142 million. Most enriched by the terror stipends is Muhammed Tus, who was released on Jan. 25 and deported to a third country via Egypt. According to PMW, Tus, who served 40 years for several terror attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians, has amassed $633,000. The runner-up is Raad Saadi, who served 36 years for killing Israeli soldiers and was deported. His bank account now has $571,000 courtesy the PA. PA President Mahmoud Abbas signed a decree on Feb. 10 that appeared to end the payments, but Marcus called the move a pretense to please the US. 'They moved the funds to another bank account, the same that pays welfare benefits, because they need the US money,' Marcus told TPS-IL. 'But several PA sources say the salaries to the terrorists will remain very high, identical to what they were. We will only know this in March, once the payments are made.' The ongoing first phase of the ceasefire is supposed to see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed over six weeks in exchange for up to 1,904 Palestinian terrorists imprisoned in Israel. The exact number will depend on how Israeli captives are alive. Since the first hostage release of Jan. 19, Hamas has freed 19 Israeli and five Thai captives in exchange for 952 imprisoned Palestinian terrorists. Hamas is due to return the bodies of four dead hostages on Thursday and free six live captives on Saturday. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 73 remaining hostages, more than 30 are believed to be dead.

Hamas official says bodies of Bibas family will return to Israel ...	Kfir and Ariel’s father, Shiri’s husband Yarden, was also taken hostage and held separately. By Ben Sales, JTA This is a developing story. A Hamas official has announced that the terror group will return the bodies of four Israeli hostages on Thursday, among them the Bibas family. Hamas is also due to release six living hostages on Saturday. The return of the bodies of Shiri, Kfir and Ariel Bibas would mark a tragic end to 16 months of activism, protest and prayer on behalf of the family, who more than anyone else became symbols of the Israeli hostages’ plight. Kfir and Ariel’s father, Shiri’s husband Yarden, was also taken hostage and held separately. He was released earlier this month. An image of Shiri clutching the two boys, then ages 9 months and 4, as they were abducted into Gaza circulated widely after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Since then, their names and pictures, identifiable by the boys’ red hair, have been at the center of global efforts to secure the hostages’ release, have symbolized the atrocities of Oct. 7 and have animated the prayers and hopes of Jews and other advocates worldwide. Images of the family in happier times have spread worldwide. Since a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023, Kfir and Ariel Bibas have been the only two children held hostage in Gaza. Hamas claimed in November 2023 that Shiri and the two boys had been killed, and Israel said it was investigating the claim but did not confirm it. In the year-plus since, advocates for the hostages have held out hope that the family remained alive. In recent weeks, Israel has broadcast increasing worry about Shiri, Kfir and Ariel, who are on the list of hostages to be released during the current ceasefire. An Israeli official expressed 'grave concerns' for their fate. Concerns rose further after Hamas announced that eight of the 33 hostages due to be released during the first phase of the ceasefire were dead. On Tuesday, in a prerecorded video, Hamas official Khalil Al-Hayya announced the release of the bodies of four hostages on Thursday, 'among them the bodies of the Bibas family.' CNN and the Associated Press also reported that Hamas announced the return of the bodies of the Bibas family. In response, relatives of the Bibases said in a statement that they had not received confirmation of Shiri, Kfir and Ariel’s fate, and asked for privacy. 'In the past few hours, we have been in turmoil following Hamas spokesperson’s announcement about the planned return of our Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir this Thursday as part of the hostages’ remains release phase,' said the statement, made via the Hostages and Families Forum. 'We want to make it clear that while we are aware of these reports, we have not yet received any official confirmation regarding this matter. Until we receive definitive confirmation, our journey is not over.' The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that four dead hostages would be released on Thursday followed by six living hostages on Saturday. The bodies of the final four hostages included in the first phase of the agreement will be released the following week. The announcement did not include the hostages’ names. 'Understandings have been reached in the Cairo negotiations according to which six living first-stage hostages will be released on Saturday,' the statement said. 'This Thursday, four deceased hostages will be returned to Israel. Pursuant to the agreement, four additional deceased hostages are due to be returned to Israel next week.'

Hamas to release six living hostages on Saturday	In addition, the remains of four hostages killed in Hamas captivity will be handed over to Israel on Thursday. By JNS The Hamas terrorist group agreed to double the number of hostages scheduled to be freed as part of the seventh release on Saturday to six, the Prime Minister’s Office in Jerusalem announced on Tuesday. In addition, the bodies of four hostages murdered in Hamas captivity will be handed over on Thursday, in line with the ceasefire deal, which stipulates that the remains will be returned on the 33rd day of the truce. 'In accordance with the agreement, four additional slain hostages are expected to be handed over to Israel next week,' the PMO added. A political source cited by Ynet earlier on Tuesday said that Jerusalem was making 'great efforts to release all six remaining living hostages in the first phase, as well as four hostages who are no longer alive.' In exchange for releasing the three additional living hostages, the Israeli government has reportedly signaled its willingness to allow the entry of hundreds of additional caravans for the reconstruction of the Strip. The Israeli official told Ynet on Tuesday, 'In the outline for the release of the hostages, Israel has committed to bringing caravans and mechanical engineering equipment into the Gaza Strip following strict inspection. As part of the negotiations, and subject to Hamas’s compliance with the deal, Israel will begin to allow this in a controlled and gradual manner.' According to official estimates, a total of 73 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza after 500-plus days, including 70 abducted during the Hamas-led cross-border terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, 2023. This figure includes the remains of at least 35 hostages, confirmed dead by Israeli authorities. Hamas is reportedly scheduled to hand over the names of the first slain captives slated for release on Thursday morning. Military ambulances will collect the bodies at a Gaza meeting point, from where they will be brought to the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv for identification. Israeli officials involved in the preparations have said that the families will only be informed after the full identification process is completed.

Egypt pushing plan to keep Gazans in Gaza – report	Cairo drafts alternative to Trump's Gaza resettlement plan, with the aim of rebuilding the Strip without relocating the area's roughly 2 million residents abroad. By World Israel News Staff Egypt is drafting an alternative plan for the future of the Gaza Strip, an Egyptian state media outlet has reported, hoping to replace President Donald Trump's proposal to resettle the entire population of Gaza abroad. The Al-Ahram newspaper, a mouthpiece of the Cairo government, reported that the Egyptian government is working to put together a comprehensive plan under which the roughly two million Gazans living in the Gaza Strip would remain in the coastal enclave during the reconstruction of the war-torn area. Under the plan, Gazans would be temporarily resettled internally within the Gaza Strip in 'secure areas,' while debris is cleared out of the Strip and towns and infrastructure rebuilt by Egyptian and foreign companies. Senior Egyptian officials have begun discussing the plan, which is still in development, with officials from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and a number of European states. A non-partisan Palestinian Arab body, separate from both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority government in Ramallah, would be tasked under the plan with administering the Strip, while a new police force made up of former PA police would provide security - with the help of additional security personnel trained by Western advisers. Egypt hopes to 'refute American President Trump's logic,' the report said. On February 4th, Trump announced his plans to resettle Gaza's population in third-party countries, including Egypt and Jordan, with reports suggesting the U.S. is also considering Indonesia, Albania, and several territories in northern and eastern Africa. Both Egypt and Jordan rejected the plan publicly, with Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, reportedly snubbing Trump, refusing to attend a planned White House meeting in protest of the resettlement plan.

Israeli lawmaker compares Trump’s Gaza plan to Holocaust	Arab party’s sole Jewish MK, already suspended from the Knesset, now faces new ethics board complaint after comparing plan to encourage voluntary mass migration of Gazans to the Holocaust. By World Israel News Staff An Israeli lawmaker sparked controversy Tuesday morning when he compared President Donald Trump’s plan to resettle the entire population of Gaza abroad – and Israel’s efforts to facilitate the implementation of the plan – to the ethnic cleansing of Jews in Austria under the Nazi regime. In a post to his X account, MK Ofer Cassif – a former Hebrew University lecturer now serving as the sole Jewish member in the Hadash-Ta’al party – published a photograph from 1938 showing Austrian Jews lined up outside of the Central Office for Jewish Emigration in Vienna. 'Eighty-six years ago this month, the ‘Central Office for Jewish Emigration’ was established in Berlin with the aim of encouraging voluntary emigration of Jews from Germany,' Cassif wrote, apparently drawing from a text published last summer marking the anniversary of the opening of the Central Office. The Central Office for Jewish Emigration was established by senior SS officer Adolf Eichmann, one of the architects of the Holocaust and the sole Nazi official to be tried and executed in the State of Israel for his role in the genocide of European Jewry. First established in Vienna in August 1938, the Central Office for Jewish Emigration was created months after the Anschluss unified Austria and Germany, bringing Vienna under Nazi rule. Cassif, who is already serving a six-month suspension from the Knesset after signing onto a petition accusing Israel of genocide in the Gaza Strip and calling for an international investigation of the Jewish state, could now face a second suspension after a fellow MK submitted a complaint with the Knesset's ethics committee. MK Amog Cohen (Otzma Yehudit) announced via X Tuesday that he had filed the complaint, calling Cassif a 'traitor.' 'I have just submitted a complaint to the Knesset Ethics Committee against the terrorist supporter Ofer Cassif for his despicable and disgraceful comparison of the voluntary migration plan for Gaza residents to the voluntary migration of Jews from Nazi Germany,' Cohen wrote. 'I sincerely hope that he will once again be severely punished and have his salary revoked. This traitor is unworthy of being in the Israeli Knesset and certainly not of representing the public. He represents the interests of Hamas and BDS movements and serves as a fifth column among us.'

Israel forms new directorate to help Gazans emigrate	The office will provide 'extensive assistance' in an attempt to implement U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Defense Minister Yisrael Katz decided Monday to establish a new directorate within his ministry to aid Palestinians who would like to leave the Gaza Strip, in line with U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal last week to resettle them elsewhere so that the Gaza Strip can be rebuilt without Hamas involvement. The ministry’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) outlined a plan for the directorate to implement, which, the ministry said, 'includes extensive assistance that will allow any Gaza resident who wants to emigrate to a third state, to receive support that includes special departure arrangements through the sea, air, and land, among other things.' The new body is expected to include representatives from several government ministries and defense establishment bodies, with the aim of providing a comprehensive framework for the process. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that he is 'committed to U.S. President Trump's plan to create a different Gaza.' He told a conference of the American umbrella group, Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, Monday night that Trump’s 'bold new vision' was 'the only plan that I think can work to enable a different future for the people of Gaza, for the people of Israel, for the surrounding areas.' 'Why not give the people of Gaza a choice? Everyone said it was the largest open-air prison in the world? It's not because of us,' he continued in his address. 'We allow people to leave. In fact, over the last two years, I think, 150,000 Gazans have left.' 'They left because they bribed their way out,' he noted. 'It wasn't via us&#8230;. The rich could leave. But if other people want to leave, give them the choice. Not forced deportation, not ethnic cleansing. In wars, people leave.' MK Ofer Cassif, the only Jewish member of the communist Hadash party, created a political storm when he reacted on X by comparing the ministry’s initiative to Nazi Germany’s establishment of an office to encourage the voluntary emigration of German Jews before World War II began. Israel Beiteinu MK Oded Forer said Cassif’s 'comparison between the voluntary departure of Gaza residents, fleeing the terror of Hamas, which condemned them to a life under a reign of terror, blood, and fire, and the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany, is not only a vicious lie, it is a despicable blood libel.' Cassif cannot be confused with facts,' he continued. 'His fondness for using the symbols of the Third Reich is rivaled only by his insane obsession with harming the State of Israel and serving the enemy's propaganda. I ask for the millionth time, is this an MK or an official Hamas spokesman? One thing is certain, he should not sit in the Israeli Knesset.' After Cassif announced last January that he would join South Africa’s petition against Israel in the International Criminal Court, Forer tried to get the requisite 90 MKs to vote on removing Cassif, but was stymied by several parliamentarians in Yesh Atid and National Unity joining Arab MKs in blocking the move. MK Almog Cohen (Otzma Yehudit) said that he would complain to the Ethics Committee and also restart the process to expel Cassif from the Knesset. His party simultaneously announced that it will submit a bill to lower the majority required to remove a Knesset member to only 80 supporters, which is still 'a significant majority that expresses the support of two thirds of the Knesset members, but is not too high to be feasible.'

British motorbiking couple detained in Iran	The couple’s last public appearance was a YouTube video filmed in the historical city of Yazd on January 3rd. They were due to reach Pakistan by January 4th, but never checked into their hotel in Kerman. By Jewish Breaking News Just days before their disappearance, British couple Craig and Lindsay Foreman wrote about their belief that 'most humans are good, kind people wanting to live a good life.' Now, the 51-year-old carpenter and his 52-year-old psychologist wife find themselves detained in Iran’s notorious prison system. Combining their love for motorcycle travel with academic curiosity, the Foremans’ were on a global expedition to explore different cultures’ perspectives on living a 'good life.' However, their pursuit of happiness would take a wrong turn when they entered Iran from Armenia around December 30, the Telegraph reports. Despite the UK government’s warnings against travel to the region, the Foremans’ remained optimistic. 'The UK government advises against all but essential travel to these areas, and the news paints a pretty grim picture,' they wrote on Facebook as they began their adventure into the Islamic Republic. 'But here’s the thing: overlanders and travelers who’ve ventured through these regions speak of nothing but warm hospitality, incredible landscapes, and memories that last a lifetime.' Their early experiences seemed to confirm this hope. Accompanied by a tour guide, they visited the country’s ancient cities of Tabriz, Tehran, and Isfahan. On January 2nd, Lindsay shared what would become her final Instagram post. 'Travel has a way of reminding you of what really matters,' she wrote. 'On this journey around the world, we’ve felt a deep sense of connection – and nowhere more so than here in Iran.' The couple’s last public appearance was a YouTube video filmed in the historical city of Yazd on January 3rd. They were due to reach Pakistan by January 4th, but never checked into their hotel in Kerman. On Thursday, Iranian state-run media outlets revealed their detention. However, the Foremans’ arrest had little to do with any actual wrongdoing. 'They weren’t arrested for committing a crime – they’re British citizens and that alone is enough to justify their detention and then phone England and ask for something,' an Iranian government source tells the Telegraph. The Foremans’ are reportedly being held in Kerman, a decision that the source suggests may be intended to limit information leaks and keep negotiations away from the capital. British Ambassador Hugo Shorter has managed to meet with the couple at the Kerman Public Prosecutor’s office, though Iranian state media has only released photos with the couples faces blurred. Credit: IRNA Speaking through the UK’s Foreign Office, the family has expressed 'significant concern' over Craig and Lindsay’s wellbeing. 'This unexpected turn of events has caused significant concern for our entire family, and we are deeply focused on ensuring their safety and well-being during this trying time. We truly appreciate the outpouring of support from friends, family, and the community, which has provided us with strength and encouragement as we face this ordeal.'

Anti-Israel students at Bowdoin College to protest suspensions ov...	Bowdoin College has previously said that it will not tolerate unlawful occupations of its buildings. By Dion J. Pierre, The Algemeiner Bowdoin College’s Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter will hold on Tuesday a mass rally to protest disciplinary charges brought against an estimated 50 student-members who received interim suspensions and other sanctions for illegally occupying an administrative building earlier this month. As previously reported by The Algemeiner, SJP installed an encampment inside Smith Union to demand a boycott of Israel and signal its opposition to US President Donald Trump’s proposal that Gazans who were displaced by the Israel-Hamas war be resettled elsewhere while the Palestinian enclave is transformed into a hub for tourism and job creation. Bowdoin, moving quickly to quell the disruption, persuaded its students to abandon the effort after just four days by levying interim suspensions on several dozen of them and notifying their families. The consequences so far have stuck, SJP decried in a statement which alleged that some students are now ineligible to dwell in their dormitories and attend class. This week, the group continued, eight of them will participate in hearings that will determine whether they receive full suspensions. SJP is calling for them to be amnestied and restored to good standing. 'Our peers who bravely remained in the encampment have been evicted from campus, unable to attend class (virtually or in person), and are now being subject to a flawed and non-transparent disciplinary process, all for continuing Bowdoin’s long history of student activism,' SJP posted on Instagram on Sunday. 'We will not be silent as our friends face retaliation for standing against a genocide.' It continued, 'Walk out of class with us at 4:30 pm on Tuesday, Feb. 18 and join us for a rally outside Moulton Union to demand amnesty for the Bowdoin Eight.' Bowdoin College has previously said that it will not tolerate unlawful occupations of its buildings. 'We heard from some members of the our community that these events have left them feeling vulnerable,' college president Safa Zaki said in a statement to the campus community, explaining that SJP transgressed 'policies governing building use and student behavior.' She continued, 'These rules are not symbolic. They are designed to ensure that members of the community can feel welcome and safe in every space on campus and have fair access to those spaces.' The college — located in Brunswick, Maine and once the subject of a landmark study which accused it of promoting the excesses of left-wing ideology — is not the only higher education institution that has been convulsed by anti-Israel activity this semester. Columbia University was a victim of infrastructural sabotage last month, when an extremist anti-Zionist group flooded the toilets of an academic building with concrete to mark the anniversary of an alleged killing of a Palestinian child. The targeted facilities were located on several floors of the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA), according to Keren Yarhi-Milo, dean of the school, who addressed the matter, calling the behavior 'deplorable, disruptive, and deeply unsettling, as our campus is a space we cherish for learning teaching, and working, and it will not be tolerated.' Numerous reports indicate the attack may have been the premeditated result of planning sessions which took place many months ago at an event held by Alpha Delta Phi (ADP) — a literary society, according to the Washington Free Beacon. During the event, the Free Beacon reported, ADP distributed literature dedicated to 'aspiring revolutionaries' who wish to commit seditious acts. Additionally, a presentation was given in which complete instructions for the exact kind of attack which struck Columbia were shared with students. In a separate incident on Feb. 5, roughly 50 members of the Students for Justice in Palestine chapter, along with the group Graduate Students for Justice in Palestine, at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) amassed on the property of UC Regent Jay Sures and threatened that he must 'divest now or pay.' As part of the demonstration, the students imprinted their hands, which had been submerged in red paint to symbolize the spilling of blood, all over Sures’ garage door and cordoned the area with caution tape. UCLA responded to their vandalism and intimidation by imposing interim suspensions on both groups. Republicans in Washington, DC have said that anti-Zionist extremism on college campuses 'will no longer be tolerated in the Trump administration.' Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has enacted a slew of policies aimed at reining in their disruptive and discriminatory behavior. Continuing work started during his first administration — when Trump issued Executive Order 13899 to ensure that civil rights law apply equally Jews — Trump’s recent 'Additional Measures to Combat Antisemitism' calls for 'using all appropriate legal tools to prosecute, remove, or otherwise … hold to account perpetrators of unlawful antisemitic harassment and violence.' The order also requires each government agency to write a report explaining how it can be of help in carrying out its enforcement. Another major provision of the order calls for the deportation of extremist 'alien' student activists, whose support for terrorist organizations, intellectual and material, such as Hamas contributed to fostering antisemitism, violence, and property destruction.

South Africa open to nuclear cooperation with Russia and Iran, mi...	South Africa’s latest comments on being open to cooperating with Iran on nuclear matters may further anger the US — and risk an energy deal currently in the works. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner South Africa would consider partnering with Russia or Iran for expanding its civilian nuclear power capacity, a move that could further strain relations with the US and delay the renewal of a strategic energy agreement. 'We can’t have a contract that says Iran or Russia must not bid, we can’t have that condition,' said Minister of Mineral and Petroleum Resources Gwede Mantashe, a leading government advocate for expanding the country’s nuclear capacity. 'If they are the best offer on the table, we’ll take any [country],' he told Reuters. South Africa is looking to add 2,500 megawatts of new nuclear capacity, building on its existing Koeberg plant, the only nuclear power plant in Africa, to address electricity outages that have hampered the economy. The comments from a senior South African government minister came after US President Donald Trump earlier this month signed an executive order to 'halt foreign aid or assistance' to South Africa partly in response to the country’s anti-Israel stance, including its case at the United Nations’ top court accusing the Jewish state of committing genocide in Gaza. Trump’s order was also a response to South Africa’s new land expropriation law, which the US argues discriminates against Afrikaners, a minority South African ethnic group of European descent. In response, South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola vowed his country will continue pursuing its case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ). During an interview with the Financial Times published last week, he also denied Trump’s remarks about South Africa’s new land reform, stating that the White House’s statements were 'misinformation.' In his executive order, Trump also accused South Africa of working with Iran 'to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.' US intelligence agencies have for years described Iran as the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism, and Washington fears that Iran’s own nuclear program is ultimately designed to build nuclear weapons — a charge denied by Tehran. 'While we do have a good relationship with Iran, we don’t have any nuclear programs with them, nor any trade to speak of,' Lamola said in response to Trump’s executive order. Since the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, which is armed and funded by Iran, invaded southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the South African government has been one of the world’s fiercest critics of Israel’s ensuing military campaign in Gaza. In late 2023, for example, South Africa temporarily withdrew its diplomats from Israel and shut down its embassy in Tel Aviv, saying the government was 'extremely concerned at the continued killing of children and innocent civilians' in Gaza. Then in December of that year, South Africa hosted two Hamas officials who attended a government-sponsored conference in solidarity with the Palestinians. One of the officials had been sanctioned by the US government for his role with the terrorist organization. Months later, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa led the crowd at an election rally in a chant of 'From the river to the sea, Palestine shall be free' — a popular slogan among anti-Israel activists that has been widely interpreted as a genocidal call for the destruction of the Jewish state, which is located between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. South Africa’s latest comments on being open to cooperating with Iran on nuclear matters may further anger the US — and risk an energy deal currently in the works. South Africa and the United States have been negotiating a new civilian nuclear pact, called a Section 123 agreement, which is necessary for the export of US-made nuclear fuel or equipment. Implemented in 1997, the previous agreement expired in December 2022. It is still unclear whether Trump’s executive order will affect the new pact in any way or further delay negotiations. 'The allegations made in the executive order can significantly complicate getting the agreement renewed,' Isabel Bosman, a nuclear energy researcher at the South African Institute of International Affairs, told Reuters. According to Zizamele Mbambo, a senior energy department official, the new agreement is almost ready, but it hasn’t been signed yet because legal processes are still ongoing. 'As far as we know, both sides remain firmly committed to concluding this new agreement,' Mbambo said.

Foreign funding of judicial-reform protests spurs Knesset legisla...	Israel’s Ministerial Committee for Legislation approved a bill on Sunday to impose an 80% tax on donations from foreign entities to Israeli non-profits. By David Isaac, JNS As billionaire Elon Musk and his youthful team of tech wizards tear through America’s administrative state, exposing waste and misuse of funds, reports emerged that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) funded judicial-reform protests in Israel. While this would constitute a blatant case of U.S. interference in Israel’s internal affairs, the way in which funds bounce from one group to another before reaching their final target makes it difficult to produce hard evidence.Israel’s Ministerial Committee for Legislation approved a bill on Sunday to impose an 80% tax on donations from foreign entities to Israeli non-profits. However, reports of heavy foreign funding of key groups opposed to the Israeli government’s plan to reform the judiciary led Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself to weigh in last week in a Knesset speech, blasting what he called the 'almost inconceivable' amounts of foreign money that drove the protest movement. Israel’s Ministerial Committee for Legislation approved a bill on Sunday to impose an 80% tax on donations from foreign entities to Israeli non-profits. Currently, those donations are tax-free. The heart of the current debate is Blue and White Future, an Israeli NGO that funded and ran the headquarters for the coalition of groups opposing judicial reform. A significant percentage of its funding came from foreign sources. The HQ’s website lists some half-dozen protest groups supported by Blue and White Future, including Achim L’Neshek ('Brothers in Arms'), which called for reservists to refuse service, and Bonot Alternativa ('Women Building an Alternative'), which introduced Handmaid’s Tale costumes to the protests. The key figures in Blue and White Future are Orni Petruschka, a high-tech entrepreneur; Ami Ayalon, a former head of the Internal Security Service (Shin Bet); and Gilead Sher, an attorney who served as chief of staff and policy coordinator to former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, one of the most vociferous of Netanyahu’s opponents. Blue and White Future was founded in 2009 as Blue and White Peace. Its initial purpose was to 'enhance and highlight' public support for the two-state solution. It changed its name by the end of that year to Blue and White Future and then its raison d’être in January 2023 (when Justice Minister Yariv Levin announced the government’s judicial-reform plan), saying its new goal was 'to preserve the democratic character of the State of Israel.' In September 2023, it hired Washington-based PR firm Trident DMG, for a three-month contract of $75,000 for 'strategic communications services' to boost its cause in the United States. It would have found a ready ear in the then-Biden administration, which made no secret of its opposition to the judicial-reform plan. U.S. President Joe Biden himself spoke out against it several times in 2023. Blue and White Future’s financials, filed with Israel’s Registrar of Associations, show that the NGO received a major shot of money in 2023, with donations jumping to 134 million shekels (~$38 million) from 824,730 shekels ($232,000) in 2022. Its budget in previous years hovered in that lower range. In 2023, it spent most of its budget, or $31 million, on opposition to judicial reform. Approximately 54%, or 83 million shekels (~$23 million), of the donations came from foreign sources and 71 million shekels (~$20 million) from within Israel. Of the foreign funds, 78 million shekels came from two American nonprofits: the Middle East Peace Dialogue Network (MEDPN)—14 million shekels (~$4 million) and PEF Israel Endowment Funds—64 million shekels (~$18 million). The MEDPN receives funds from NGOs that were given U.S. government funds. But it’s impossible to trace the origin of the money, as it’s already too far removed from the source. For instance, USAID gives to Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, Inc., which donates to the Jewish Communal Fund, which in turn donates to MEDPN, according to DataRepublican, a website that tracks taxpayer funds. PEF Israel’s receipt of U.S. taxpayer funds is negligible. It received $149,000 in indirect government monies, or 0.5% of its total contributions of $281 million in 2023, DataRepublican reported. The torrent of U.S. taxpayer money streaming out of U.S. government coffers and adding to America’s $2 trillion deficit is what the Trump administration wants to bring under control. In a Feb. 11 press conference, Elon Musk, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), joined President Donald Trump at the Oval Office to discuss his efforts. He noted that many payments his team found didn’t have a categorization code or description of what the payments were for, meaning there was no way to track them. There is a 'massive number' of such checks 'flying out of the building,' Musk said. With such few basic controls, it seems unlikely that Musk’s team will uncover a smoking gun pointing to USAID grants going to Israeli NGOs. However, Knesset Member Yitzhak Kroizer of the Otzma Yehudit Party, who wrote to Musk on Feb. 16 requesting a meeting to discuss the misuse of U.S. taxpayer funds in Israel, expressed cautious optimism that much could be uncovered. 'It will be very difficult to track all the money,' Kroizer told JNS. 'But we will be able to identify fund transfers from certain entities, parties and nonprofits and how it flows from the United States to groups in Israel.' Kroizer is interested in exposing the mechanism by which the funds are piped in, not specific dollar amounts, noting that the names of the associations change but the methods remain the same. 'They find the same ways each time to transfer the funds,' he said. The U.S. has a history of interfering in Israeli politics, along with certain European countries, he added. 'It’s the same countries all the time.' In May 2023, a bill that would have significantly limited the amount that Israeli NGOs could receive from foreign governments was dropped after harsh criticism from the United States, Germany and France. By protesting the bill, those countries were 'probably' pointing a guilty finger at themselves, Kroizer said. In his letter to Musk, he noted, 'It is well known in both Israel and the United States that past administrations have used American funds to exert improper influence in Israeli affairs. The 2015 incident involving OneVoice and VI5—organizations that received funding from the Obama administration while working to oppose the Netanyahu government—left a lasting negative impression.' Kroizer was referring to the scandal in which a U.S. Senate subcommittee found that the Obama administration’s State Department had donated about $350,000 to a group trying to defeat Netanyahu in the 2015 Israeli elections. The Knesset passed a law the following year requiring nonprofits that receive more than half their funding from abroad to disclose it each year to the NGO Registrar at the Justice Ministry. The United States expressed its concern with that law, too, with the Obama administration’s Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro meeting with the law’s sponsor, then-Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked. A U.S. embassy statement released after the meeting put in diplomatic language American displeasure, saying Shapiro 'reiterated' the United States’ view that 'a free and functioning civil society is an essential element of a healthy democracy, and that governments must protect free expression and peaceful dissent and create an atmosphere where all voices can be heard.' It remains to be seen whether the current proposed Knesset bill, whose stated purpose is 'to reduce the indirect influence of foreign government and political entities on the State of Israel'—if it becomes law—will have better luck than previous efforts to sharply cut outside activity in shaping Israeli politics.

Terrorists behind Nova massacre had planned to take over city	Israeli army's investigation into the security failures during the October 7th invasion of Israel reveal that terrorist forces which conducted massacre at music festival had arrived there by accident - and had actually planned to take over a nearby city. By World Israel News Staff The most deadly massacre carried out by Gazan terrorists during their invasion of Israel on October 7th was the result in part of a navigational error by the terrorists, who had planned a potentially larger attack on a nearby Israeli city. On Monday, Israel's national broadcaster, Kan, revealed that the Israeli military probe into the invasion found that the terrorists who carried out the Nova music festival massacre outside Kibbutz Re'im on the morning of October 7th had actually targeted the city of Netivot. The Nova massacre, the deadliest massacre of October 7th, leaving over 360 people dead and 44 taken hostage, was carried out by a force of 100 to 120 terrorists from Hamas' Nuseirat Brigade. The terrorist force crossed over from Gaza into Israeli territory during the second wave of attacks at 7:30 a.m., approximately an hour after the initial attacks. The Nuseirat force entered Israeli territory in 14 pickup trucks and two motorcycles, the report said, and was armed with two heavy machine guns, three smaller machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, assault rifles, and grenades. The terrorists had been assigned to capture the city of Netivot, but during the invasion the force lost its bearings, eventually stumbling upon the Nova festival outside of Kibbutz Rei'm instead, an hour and a half after the force entered Israeli territory. Had the terrorists succeeded into locating Netivot, located five kilometers northeast of Kibbutz Re'im and the Nova festival, the city would have been the most populous Israeli community to face Gazan invaders on October 7th. Home to roughly 52,000 people in 2023, Netivot is significantly larger than the the two cities invaded on October 7th: Ofakim, with a population of 35,000, and Sderot, home to 33,000.

Lawmakers who back Hamas are ‘sicker’ than the terrorists, says H...	The putative U.S. ambassador to Israel also put the military option on the table regarding the president’s absolute opposition to a nuclear Iran. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News President Donald Trump’s nominee for U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, slammed Congressional supporters of Hamas and said Iran is under definite threat of attack if it doesn’t give up its nuclear ambitions in an interview Monday on Fox News’ Varney and Co. show. After citing the Hamas-led massacre of 1,200 people and taking of 250 hostages during its October 7, 2023, invasion of Israel that immediately sparked war in the Gaza Strip, interviewer Stuart Varney expressed surprise that the terror organization could still have backers in Congress. Without mentioning any names, Huckabee responded, 'It’s beyond comprehension that anybody would understand what Hamas did, what they continue to do, the threats they continue to make as recently as a week ago, saying they want to have another October 7, and somehow show support for that.' While the terrorists 'are very sick people,' he added, 'the sicker ones' are 'the ones who know what they did&#8230;some of whom even serve in Congress, and think it was OK – or at least think it was justified.' In the immediate aftermath of the massacre in southern Israel, Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) blamed Israel for the slaughter, saying that its 'apartheid system' creates 'conditions that can lead to resistance.' She and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York have repeatedly falsely accused Israel of breaking international law and committing genocide, while ignoring Hamas’ documented war crimes. Tlaib has also employed at least three individuals with Hamas connections and was called out as a 'Hamas sympathizer' by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries after she repeated a lie about the IDF attacking a hospital early on in the war when it was struck by a failed Palestinian missile launched at Israel. Huckabee praised Trump’s firm support of the Jewish state while calling the former president Joe Biden’s policy towards the Israel and Hamas 'schizophrenic.' 'One day, he’s all for Israel. The next day, he puts more pressure on them to have a ceasefire than he did on Hamas to release American hostages. This was insane, and it’s cost us a lot of time, money, and human lives,' he said. Regarding Iran’s nuclear program, Varney ran a clip of National Security Advisor Mike Waltz saying that Trump has been very clear that the Islamic Republic 'can never have a nuclear weapon,' since it was 'an irrational actor that we cannot allow to have their finger on the button.' He then asked Huckabee, 'Doesn’t it sound to you like an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is coming?' The future ambassador answered, 'Either that or they’re going to surrender it, they’re not going to get one.' He said 'everyone else in the entire world who has a brain' is 'giving a standing ovation to that doctrine,' including the Arab countries in the region. 'They all understand that Israel is no threat to them, they don’t have to worry that Israel is going to launch an attack on Egypt or Jordan or the Saudis. They’re worried about Iran,' he continued. 'And whether it’s Israel that pulls the trigger, or it’s a combination of nations, I hope the Iranian leaders, as crazed as they are, have at least enough sense to listen carefully to what’s being said. They’re not going to have a nuclear weapon, full stop.'

Israel accuses Egypt of breaking 1979 peace treaty with Sinai bui...	Israeli Ambassador to US warns Egypt's military buildup in the Sinai Peninsula constitutes a 'very serious violation' of the 1979 peace treaty brokered by President Jimmy Carter. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A senior Israeli diplomat has accused Egypt of violating the landmark peace treaty between the two countries by militarizing the Sinai Peninsula. Late last month, Israel's Ambassador to the United States, Yehiel Leiter, addressed a gathering of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, ahead of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's meeting with President Donald Trump in the White House. A video of Leiter's address during the event was published on Friday, only to be later removed. During his remarks, Leiter blasted Egypt for militarizing the Sinai Peninsula, a move that if verified would constitute a 'very serious violation,' Leiter said. In 1979, then-President Jimmy Carter brokered the Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty, ending 31 years of hostilities and establishing full relations between the two countries. The agreement, which was predicated on Israel's return of the entire Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, imposed strict limits on Cairo's rights to deploy armed forces to the Sinai, including a single armored division in the Suez Canal Zone, four battalions of border police in Central Sinai, with no military presence in the Eastern Sinai, facing the Israeli frontier. Beginning in 2013, Israel has approved temporary deployments of Egyptian forces in the Central and Eastern Sinai to combat Islamist forces in the Peninsula, or to curb Hamas smuggling into the Gaza Strip. However, according to Leiter, Egypt is now constructing military facilities in the Sinai with clear offensive military capabilities. 'There are bases being built, and they can only be used for offensive operations and offensive weapons,' Leiter said. 'This is a clear violation. For a long time, this issue has been shoved to the side, but it continues. This is an issue that we are going to put on the table – very soon and very emphatically.' During the 46 years since the treaty was inked, Israel has never before accused Egypt of violating the deal, which marked the first time an Arab state ended a state of war with Israel and established full relations. Last week, Yuval Steinitz, a former Strategic Affairs Minister under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who now chairs the Israeli arms manufacturer Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, said Egypt's buildup in the Sinai is a cause for concern. 'There is definitely reason to view Egypt’s military buildup with concern,' Steinitz told Yedioth Aharanoth. 'Relations between Israel and Egypt are currently stable, but if one day we become weak, everyone in the region will seize the opportunity.'

‘Trump, you’re my hope’ – Freed hostage to US president	I beg you, don’t stop until all the hostages, the living and the dead, are brought home,' Berger said in a heartfelt plea. By World Israel News Staff Former Hamas hostage Agam Berger thanked President Donald J. Trump in a video posted on social media, crediting him with securing her release from captivity and stressing the importance of continuing the hostage deal. Berger, who was kidnapped from the Nahal Oz base adjacent to the Gaza Strip on October 7th, 2023, was released in late January after being held by the terror group for nearly 15 months. In the video, Berger thanked Trump 'from the bottom of my heart for all you have done and all that you continue to do for the hostages.' Addressing Trump, Berger emphasized that 'because of you, we came home.' Breaking: Former hostage Agam Berger, who was just released from captivity, thanks @POTUS Trump for his efforts to free the hostages.

I suffered a lot, others are still there suffering'. @SteveWitkoff pic.twitter.com/ozQJCrsEcj &mdash; Neria Kraus (@NeriaKraus) February 18, 2025 She added that there are additional hostages in Gaza 'who really depend on you and are waiting for you to save them from there.' She stressed that Trump 'has the power to' save the rest of the hostages, whom she said are suffering every day they remain in captivity. 'I beg you, don’t stop until all the hostages, the living and the dead, are brought home,' Berger said in a heartfelt plea. Trump reposted the video without comment on his Truth Social platform. Berger was one of five female observation soldiers recently released by the terror group, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Keith Siegel, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen, recently released a video thanking Trump after he was released from captivity earlier in February. 'President Trump, you are the reason I am home alive,' Siegel said in the video. 'You are the reason I was reunited with my beloved wife, four children and five grandchildren.' Like Berger, Siegel beseeched Trump to ensure the ceasefire holds until the hostage deal is completed. 'I trust in your strength and leadership Mr. President,' Siegel said. 'The helpless hostages in the dark, cold tunnels in Gaza also trust you. Please bring them home.'

‘All options on the table’ for stopping Iran’s nuke program, says...	Michael Waltz, President Trump's National Security Advisor, says the president is 'dead serious' about preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, says 'all options are on the table' to block Tehran's nuclear ambitions. By World Israel News Staff The Trump administration is committed to prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, a top administration official said Sunday, hinting that the U.S. is considering military intervention to prevent Iran's nuclear program from reaching break-out capacity. On Sunday, President Donald Trump's National Security Advisor, former Congressman Michael Waltz, appeared on Fox News warning that Trump is 'dead serious' about preventing Iran from going nuclear and that 'all options are on the table' to prevent Tehran from achieving weapons-grade enrichment. 'I could speak to what the President has repeatedly said, and that is Iran can never have a nuclear weapon,' Waltz said. 'That not only would be existential for Israel. I think it would be existential for the entire world, because it could kick off a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.' Waltz refused to speak directly to what proposals are on the table for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, saying only that Trump has shown he is ready to take 'whatever action is necessary.' 'How we get there, I'm not going to get into the details of here, but the President has also expressed a willingness to take whatever action is necessary.' 'All options are on the table, but also to talk to Iran as well, if they want to give up their entire program and not play games, as we have seen Iran do in the past in prior negotiations.' 'So all options are on the table, but I'll promise you this: President Trump is absolutely serious, deadly serious, when he says Iran can never have a nuke, and certainly not on President Trump's watch. They are an irrational actor that we cannot allow to have their finger on the button.' During President Joe Biden's lame duck session following the election of Donald Trump last November, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan briefed Biden on possible options for military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, should Iran attempt to rush towards development of a nuclear weapon prior to Trump's inauguration last month. Israel is reportedly considering airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities sometime over the next few months, U.S. intel officials estimate.

The eastern part of Oregon is ideologically at odds with the urban and progressive areas of the state, as evidenced by the intensity of anti-police protests in Portland in 2020. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Conservative eastern Oregon has proposed to secede from the state and become part of the neighboring red state of Idaho. The eastern part of Oregon is ideologically at odds with the urban and progressive areas of the state, as evidenced by the intensity of anti-police protests in Portland in 2020. 'The Greater Idaho Movement has always been about the people of Eastern Oregon getting their voices heard and helping those communities get the kind of state-level governance they actually want,' Executive Director Matt McCaw told Fox News Digital. 'If the Oregon Legislature truly believes in democracy, they will honor those voters' wishes and move forward on making a border change happen.' Earlier this month, State Rep. Mark Owens (R-Malheur) introduced HB 3844, a bill that establishes a task force to assess the impact of moving the Idaho border to include approximately 13 eastern Oregon counties. The measure also mandates that a report be submitted to lawmakers in Salem. The Greater Idaho Movement began sponsoring measures in favor of secession during the Portland riots in 2020, and calls to join Idaho have grown louder as the ideological divisions persist. In 2020, Portland was nearly at a standstill during a violent standoff in front of the Mark Hatfield Federal Courthouse that lasted for days. Greater Idaho President Mike McCarter commented on the proposal: 'We are encouraged to see the representatives of Eastern Oregon coming together to advocate for their voters by bringing these bills to the Legislature. The people of Eastern Oregon have made it clear they want to explore moving the border and joining Idaho.' 'This movement has always been about the people of Eastern Oregon getting their voices heard and helping those communities get the kind of state-level governance they actually want.' Although similar calls to secede from one state and join another have rarely been successful, there are other proposals in various parts of the United States. For instance, a number of conservative, rural communities in Illinois are seeking to disassociate themselves from progressive Chicago and join neighboring red state Indiana. For decades, Staten Island has sought to secede from New York City, and despite a 2-to-1 vote by the residents to secede, the measure was quashed by New York State's Democratic Party.

Although Israel informed then-U.S. President Biden about the recordings, the Biden administration still pressured Israel to send hundreds of aid trucks into Gaza daily. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Recordings of conversations between Hamas officials prove that the humanitarian aid entering Gaza in 2024 went directly to Hamas, Channel 12 revealed this week. Although Israel informed then-U.S. President Biden about the recordings, the Biden Administration still pressured Israel to send hundreds of aid trucks into Gaza daily. The recordings also provided further evidence of Hamas' close ties with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). In one recording, a Hamas member said, 'Currently, monitoring is in progress, and we will receive updates. There are confirmed injuries, including some UNRWA employees. Two of the injured are police officers.' In another conversation, junior Hamas members complained they were not receiving aid, and in response, they were told their wives had been attacked in a Rafah mosque. 'They enter the women’s room and beat them,' the Hamas members were heard saying. 'We will redeem our people with our soul and our blood.' One source responded to the incident by stating, 'The leadership is not involved and has been monitoring the situation from the very beginning.' The conversation also revealed anger at senior Hamas officials over their corrupt behavior. A junior Hamas member stated, 'I promise you, we will tear you to pieces. Make sure the leadership in Khan Yunis hears this too. We will tear you apart. You’re only focused on yourselves. There is no real leadership.' He continued, 'All the leaders in Khan Yunis should hang their heads in shame, as they are not men. They invade women's rooms and assault them there. Everyone must understand that our honor is far more valuable than our lives.' Gazan civilians have repeatedly claimed that Hamas steals humanitarian aid and keeps it for themselves or sells it at exorbitant prices. In a recorded conversation, a Palestinian man in Gaza told an IDF soldier that Hamas was stealing UNRWA humanitarian aid. He said, 'The situation is terrible because the people responsible for the humanitarian aid are thieves.' 'Hamas has their hands on UNRWA administration workers and controls UNRWA,' he explained.

Smotrich freezes additional PA funds, will use them to assist ter...	This is the latest in a series of liens that freeze designated PA funds, preventing them from being used to finance terrorism. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich signed an additional lien of 320 million shekels in Palestinian Authority (PA) funds on Monday. This was the latest in a series of liens that freeze designated PA funds to prevent them from being used to finance terrorism. The money will be used instead to compensate victims of terror. Smotrich stated, 'There is no more just and righteous action than stopping the Palestinian Authority from financing terrorism and redirecting its funds to support the families of terror victims. This is a crucial step in our national fight against terrorism and the Palestinian Authority that fosters it.' He continued, 'This action aligns with the Gaza payroll deductions, the halt on payments to terrorists, and numerous other measures I’ve implemented as part of the unwavering policy I've consistently followed since taking office. We are cutting off the sources of funding for terrorism and preventing the Palestinian Authority from using its funds to fuel incitement and violence. I will continue to take decisive action to ensure the security of Israel's citizens.' Last month, Israel recovered funds to cover a decade-old $1.1 billion Palestinian Authority electricity debt by redirecting money from the Norwegian Fund, where PA funds have been deposited since the beginning of the war. The Finance Ministry issued an order to the Norwegian Fund, which had been receiving 275 million shekels monthly, deducted from PA funds. The money from the Norwegian Fund will be used to settle outstanding debts the PA has owed to Israel for over 10 years. Half of the funds will go to companies that provided fuel to the PA; the other half will be directed to Israel’s electric company. Last spring, after Norway announced its recognition of a Palestinian state, Smotrich halted payments to the Norwegian Fund and redirected the funds to a new account. Instead of transferring money to the Palestinian Authority after the war, Israel will now use the funds to pay off the PA’s debts to Israel.

With 21 staff members having lost immediate family members and hundreds serving as reservists, it’s the unseen bravery of these heroes that keeps Gozlan and her team working 500 days later. By Jewish Breaking News Dawn hadn’t yet broken over Jerusalem when the first casualties began arriving at Hadassah’s emergency rooms on October 7, 2023. The hospital staff didn’t know it then, but they were about to treat victims of the deadliest attack on Israeli soil in decades, even as some of their own loved ones were caught in the violence. Lilach Gozlan, head of staff welfare at Hadassah, remWith 21 staff members having lost immediate family members and hundreds serving as reservists, it’s the unseen bravery of these heroes that keeps Gozlan and her team working 500 days later.embers those first days vividly. When she learned that one employee’s family had fallen into financial crisis after losing a relative at Nova, she knew they had to act. 'We couldn’t leave them alone, helpless,' she says. The hospital’s initial response looked a lot like triage. They set up a welfare fund. They mobilized 500 volunteers to call every single employee, paying special attention to the 86 staff members living within range of Gaza. However, money and phone calls were just the beginning. Children were another immediate concern. With schools closed and parents needed at the hospital, Hadassah’s welfare department transformed protected spaces near the hospital into makeshift daycare centers. Pre-army volunteers and professional staff cared for up to 200 kids, from newborns to 12-year-olds, running from early morning until late afternoon. Then came the military call-ups. Over 400 Hadassah employees joined the reserves, along with nearly 500 of their family members. When these workers started returning to their hospital jobs, the cracks began to show. Some of them couldn’t shake what they’d seen. 'In COVID there was a set formula, we’d send food packages to those affected and so on,' Gozlan explains. 'But there were no procedures for October 7 and what’s happened since.' Yet the hospital kept adapting. They brought in experts for webinars on trauma. They trained managers on how to support returning soldiers. They worked to keep peace between Jewish and Arab staff members. They even brought in performers to lift spirits. With 21 staff members having lost immediate family members and hundreds serving as reservists, it’s the unseen bravery of these heroes that keeps Gozlan and her team working 500 days later. They’re still distributing aid packages, still providing counseling, and still making sure no one falls through the cracks.

Hamas expected to return bodies of several hostages on Thursday	Meanwhile, Ynet reported on Monday night that Israel is demanding the freedom of six living hostages instead of the agreed three during the seventh release scheduled for Saturday. By JNS Jerusalem is preparing to receive the bodies of four or five hostages on Thursday who were murdered in captivity in the Gaza Strip, Israel’s Kan News public broadcaster reported on Monday. The ceasefire deal with the Palestinian terrorist group stipulates that the bodies of four hostages will be returned to the Jewish state on the 33rd day of the ceasefire, which went into effect Jan. 19, an Israeli official told Walla news. According to Kan News, Hamas is scheduled to hand over the names of the slain captives on Thursday morning. Israeli military ambulances will collect the bodies at a meeting point, from where they will be brought to the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv for identification. Officials involved in the preparations stressed that the hostages’ families will only be informed after the identification process is completed. Meanwhile, Ynet reported on Monday night that Israel is demanding the freedom of six living hostages during the seventh release scheduled for Saturday. According to the deal, Hamas is required to release three captives. In exchange for releasing the additional hostages, the Israeli government has signaled its willingness to allow the entry of hundreds of additional caravans into the Strip, the report claimed. The three latest returnees from Hamas captivity in Gaza were reunited on Saturday with their families—American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36; Alexander ('Sasha') Troufanov, 29, who has dual Russian-Israeli citizenship; and Argentine-Israeli national Iair Horn, 46. Saturday’s release was the sixth such round under phase one of the ceasefire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump’s leadership and Israel’s coordination with the United States on Saturday, highlighting that the reinforcement of IDF troops around Gaza and the U.S. president’s firm stance led to the release of three hostages despite Hamas’s threats to delay the exchange. Trump on Saturday congratulated the freed hostages but made clear that their release fell short of his call to free all the captives. 'Hamas has just released three Hostages from GAZA, including an American Citizen. They seem to be in good shape! This differs from their [Hamas’s] statement last week that they would not release any Hostages,' he wrote on his Truth Social social media platform. 'Israel will now have to decide what they will do about the 12:00 O’CLOCK, TODAY, DEADLINE imposed on the release of ALL HOSTAGES. The United States will back the decision they make!' he added, apparently referring to U.S. Eastern Time, or 7 p.m. in Israel. Trump’s deadline was a reference to his previous warning that the 'gates of hell' could be unleashed if Hamas did not release all of the hostages. According to official estimates, 73 hostages remain in Hamas captivity in Gaza after 500 days, including 70 abducted during the Hamas-led terrorist attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

500 days in captivity: Knesset hears of released hostages’ ongoin...	These are captivity survivors who have endured life-altering experiences that will leave them with lifelong scars,' said Professor Hagai Levine, who has been actively accompanying the families since the beginning of the war. By Sveta Listratov, TPS As Israelis marked the 500th day of captivity for the hostages in Gaza, lawmakers of the Knesset’s Health Committee gathered on Monday to hear about the medical and psychological state of those who have returned. 'It is crucial to hear the entire truth about the situation of those who have returned from Gaza and their families. The testimonies we have heard here are important,' said MK Tatiana Mazarsky of Yesh Atid, who initiated the committee meeting. 'It is difficult to expose the trauma, and that’s why the world doesn’t care about our suffering. They don’t see our pain. They think we are only attackers. We must not remain silent. We must show what we are going through.' The session included emotional testimony from the families of returnees and the medical professionals involved in the rehabilitation. Shemi Kalderon, whose 54-year-old nephew Ofer was held captive and released a few weeks ago, shared his nephew’s health condition. Ofer was hospitalized for several days after his return due to a severe flu and pneumonia. 'Three months ago, Ofer weighed 25 kilos less than today. He said that in the tunnel where he was held, there was a scale. When they realized he would be among the released hostages, and saw how he looked, he had been fed rotten vegetables. He hadn’t seen daylight for 484 days. He had no access to a shower, maybe once every two or three months, all that aside from the physical injuries he endured,' Kalderon shared. Carmit Palty Katzir insisted to lawmakers that it is impossible for her, her family, and the entire nation to heal the wounds at this time. 'We are still at war; it’s the 500th of October for us today. Until the last hostage returns, we will not heal,' she declared. Her father was murdered at Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7 while her mother Hanna and brother Elad were taken to Gaza. Hanna was released during a temporary ceasefire in November 2023, but died of health complications from her captivity the following year. Soldiers recovered Elad’s body in April 2024. 'It is a disgrace and a shame that we have reached day 500. Everywhere I go, I feel compelled to warn that there are helpless people in captivity we must save,' Palty Katzir said. Families of returning hostages have previously described physical abuse, torture, and psychological pressure their loved ones went through, while images of emaciated returnees shocked Israelis. Professor Hagai Levine, who has been actively accompanying the families since the beginning of the war, described the situation with hostages as unprecedented in Israel. 'These are captivity survivors who have endured life-altering experiences that will leave them with lifelong scars,' he said, calling for comprehensive, systematic research into their condition. Dr. Hagar Mizrahi of the Health Ministry told lawmakers, 'Even if some may look fine on the outside, the hospital tests often reveal hidden damage.' She stressed the need for sustained, individualized care for each returning captive and said the ministry will work 'hand in hand' with the survivors and their families for years to come. Michal Mizrahi from Tel Aviv’s Ichilov Hospital, echoed the need for long-term support, detailing the condition of four hostages the hospital treated, who have been held underground for extended periods. 'They suffered from muscle atrophy, drastic weight loss, and vitamin deficiencies,' she reported, stressing that rehabilitation is focused on restoring physical capabilities, with continuous evaluation and nutritional support. The committee acknowledged significant improvements in the health system work with hostages, but recognized persistent gaps, including the need for better mental health services, long-term financial support, and addressing the needs of secondary victims—children, siblings, and caregivers of the surviving hostages.

IDF nabs terrorists, seizes weapons, cash in Judea and Samaria	During another operation in the Ephraim Brigade area of responsibility, which covers the Tulkarem and Qalqilya sectors in western Samaria, forces arrested a terrorism suspect and seized an M-16 rifle and two handguns. By JNS Israeli security forces arrested Palestinian terrorists while seizing arms and funds during overnight raids throughout Judea and Samaria on Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces said. The IDF, Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) and Israel Police 'continue to operate throughout Judea and Samaria to thwart terrorism in order to maintain the security of the citizens of the State of Israel,' the army said on Monday. In Deir Abu Mash’al, 15 miles west of Ramallah and close to the Samaria security barrier across from Ben-Gurion International Airport, troops detained seven suspects. Meanwhile, in Al-Arroub, near Bethlehem in Judea, two were arrested. At the same time, Israel’s security agencies continue 'Operation Iron Wall' to thwart terror in the northern part of Samaria, the IDF said. 'Overnight, forces located and confiscated a number of weapons in Jenin, and destroyed a number of explosive devices in Tulkarem,' according to the military. During another operation in the Ephraim Brigade area of responsibility, which covers the Tulkarem and Qalqilya sectors in western Samaria, forces arrested a terrorism suspect and seized an M-16 rifle and two handguns. In the Arab village of Osarin, located near Nablus in the IDF’s Samaria Brigade deployment area, one wanted terrorist was arrested. The Israeli government recorded thousands of Palestinian terrorist attacks against Jews in 2024—including many in Judea and Samaria. Earlier this month, the IDF expanded 'Operation Iron Wall,' saying it plans to form a new battalion that will remain in Jenin and Tulkarem after the counter-terrorism operation. In January, an unnamed senior security force told Israel’s Channel 14 News broadcaster that the large-scale campaign against Iranian-backed terrorist organizations in northern Samaria could take several months. 'When it ends, the terror camps will cease to exist. What we did in Gaza, we will do to them as well; we will leave them in ruins,' the source said.

Construction of the outposts has already started and many have already been built. By JNS Israel Defense Forces soldiers will remain deployed at five outposts in Southern Lebanon beyond the Feb. 18 deadline set out in the truce deal with Beirut, the army’s Northern Command confirmed on Monday. Israel’s decision to keep boots on the ground in Lebanon was made in conjunction with the Trump administration. The company-size posts, located within several hundred meters of the border, will be manned by hundreds of IDF soldiers until the political echelon decides otherwise. The five outposts are located at a hill near Labbouneh, opposite the Israeli border town of Shlomi; on the Jabal Blat peak, opposite Moshav Zar’it; on a hill opposite Moshav Avivim and Kibbutz Malkia; on a hill opposite Moshav Margaliot; and on a hill opposite the town of Metula. The IDF is taking into account that Hezbollah terrorists may attempt to damage the outposts—which are all located outside of built-up areas—and is preparing for expected provocations against troops. Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem warned Israel on Sunday that if it does not withdraw its forces by Tuesday, 'we will know how to deal with it. 'Israel must fully withdraw on February 18, it has no excuse,' the top terrorist leader said in a televised speech cited by the France 24 outlet. תום תקופת המבחן בלבנון מחר: בפיקוד הצפון נערכים לסוף תקופת היישום להפסקת האש בלבנון, כולל נסיגה של כוחות צה'ל, מלבד חמישה מוצבים שנבנו בשטח לבנון כפי שפרסמנו בשבוע שעבר במשך חודשיים וחצי, כך אומרים בפיקוד הצפון, לוחמי צה'ל פעלו בדרום לבנון למקסם את ההישג שהגיעו אליהם במהלך… pic.twitter.com/3B6aqR74rv &mdash; איתי בלומנטל Itay Blumental (@ItayBlumental) February 17, 2025 In addition to its continued presence in Lebanon, the IDF is working to build forward operating outposts near every border town. Construction of the outposts has already started and many have already been built. If the relative calm on the border with Lebanon is preserved, residents of evacuated communities in northern Israel will be able to return to their homes on the planned date of March 1, the IDF statement said. The truce with Lebanon, which took effect on Nov. 27, mandated an IDF redeployment within 60 days. However, the U.S.-monitored agreement is expected to continue until Feb. 18, the White House said on Jan. 26. Under the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon, the IDF is to gradually withdraw from Southern Lebanon as the Lebanese Armed Forces and U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon assume responsibility for ensuring Hezbollah remains disarmed in the country’s south. However, there have been growing doubts in Jerusalem that the LAF can fulfill its obligation to clamp down on Hezbollah’s presence. The Israeli army remains engaged in frequent operations in the area. On Sunday, IDF troops destroyed an underground tunnel system near the border that was used by the terrorist group’s elite Radwan Unit and contained 'living quarters and combat equipment,' the military said. In recent weeks, soldiers from the 810th 'Mountain' Brigade, under the command of the 210th 'Bashan' Division, completed dozens of targeted raids in Southern Lebanon’s Mount Dov area to 'remove threats facing the State of Israel and its citizens,' according to the IDF statement.

The eastern part of Oregon is ideologically at odds with the urban and progressive areas of the state, as evidenced by the intensity of anti-police protests in Portland in 2020. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Conservative eastern Oregon has proposed to secede from the state and become part of the neighboring red state of Idaho. The eastern part of Oregon is ideologically at odds with the urban and progressive areas of the state, as evidenced by the intensity of anti-police protests in Portland in 2020. 'The Greater Idaho Movement has always been about the people of Eastern Oregon getting their voices heard and helping those communities get the kind of state-level governance they actually want,' Executive Director Matt McCaw told Fox News Digital. 'If the Oregon Legislature truly believes in democracy, they will honor those voters' wishes and move forward on making a border change happen.' Earlier this month, State Rep. Mark Owens (R-Malheur) introduced HB 3844, a bill that establishes a task force to assess the impact of moving the Idaho border to include approximately 13 eastern Oregon counties. The measure also mandates that a report be submitted to lawmakers in Salem. The Greater Idaho Movement began sponsoring measures in favor of secession during the Portland riots in 2020, and calls to join Idaho have grown louder as the ideological divisions persist. In 2020, Portland was nearly at a standstill during a violent standoff in front of the Mark Hatfield Federal Courthouse that lasted for days. Greater Idaho President Mike McCarter commented on the proposal: 'We are encouraged to see the representatives of Eastern Oregon coming together to advocate for their voters by bringing these bills to the Legislature. The people of Eastern Oregon have made it clear they want to explore moving the border and joining Idaho.' 'This movement has always been about the people of Eastern Oregon getting their voices heard and helping those communities get the kind of state-level governance they actually want.' Although similar calls to secede from one state and join another have rarely been successful, there are other proposals in various parts of the United States. For instance, a number of conservative, rural communities in Illinois are seeking to disassociate themselves from progressive Chicago and join neighboring red state Indiana. For decades, Staten Island has sought to secede from New York City, and despite a 2-to-1 vote by the residents to secede, the measure was quashed by New York State's Democratic Party.

Comedian Dave Chappelle ends show with ‘Free Palestine’ slogan	Comedian and actor Dave Chappelle accuses Saturday Night Live of barring him from talking about the situation in the Gaza Strip, ends stand-up comedy show by declaring 'Give the Jews a break, free Palestine.' By World Israel News Staff Stand-up comedian and actor Dave Chappelle accused the producers of Saturday Night Live of censoring him during his recent appearance on the show, barring him from discussing the situation in the Gaza Strip. During a stand-up comedy show in San Francisco last week, the 51-year-old said that he had been explicitly warned ahead of his January 18th appearance on SNL not to raise either Gaza or transgenderism, SFGate reported. Nevertheless, Chappelle did allude to the former during his monologue on the show. 'Do not forget your humanity, and please have empathy for displaced people whether they’re in the Palisades or Palestine,' Chappelle said. During last week's show in San Francisco, Chappelle made a more explicit political appeal on the issue, ending his show with the declaration: 'Give the Jews a break, free Palestine.' Chappelle, a convert to Islam, has in the past accused Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip. Last May, during the IDF's ground operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, Chappelle had the song 'My Blood is Palestinian' by Mohammed Assaf played during a show in Abu Dhabi. As the audience began to chant 'Free Palestine,' Chappelle responded by calling Israel's war in Gaza an act of 'genocide.' In October 2023, shortly after the Hamas invasion of Israel, a number of audience members jeered Chappelle, with some leaving the event hall, after the comedian accused Israel of war crimes and slammed the Israeli government for initially closing off Israeli-supplied water and electricity to the Gaza Strip.

Elimination of Hamas still 2 years away, Israeli envoy says	Israel's New York consul-general said Israel will never accept a ‘terror state' in Gaza or Judea and Samaria, and knows it has full U.S. backing. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel’s consul-general in New York, Ofir Akunis, said that it will take another year or two to eliminate Hamas, and that the government knows it has full U.S. backing to reject a 'terror state' right on its borders, The New York Post reported Saturday. In an interview last week, the paper said, Akunis had compared the fight against Hamas to World War II. 'It will take time. We can stop [the war] after Hamas is not there — maybe it will take another year or two years. It took six years, six years for the Western world, to defeat Germany,' he observed. Akunis specifically mentioned that there were 'hundreds of miles' of terror tunnels still left under major portions of the Gaza Strip, that needed to be blocked up or destroyed. Leaving the majority in place through lack of choice, the IDF focused on blowing up only the most strategic tunnels while fighting the terrorist forces in the coastal enclave over 15 months of warfare, until a ceasefire went into effect last month. Akunis did not say that Israel would end the ceasefire and go back to fighting to get rid of Hamas, although U.S. President Donald Trump had given Israel the green light to do so last week. He did state that if the war does resume, it would 'look different' than before, without providing details. Israel knows it has full American backing with the current administration to do whatever would be necessary, the consul-general said, while making a point of praising Trump’s revolutionary idea to remove all the Gazans to other countries while the U.S. rebuilds the enclave. 'All of the international community must be open to new ideas,' he said of the reconstruction project, which could take a decade or more. With the exception so far of the UAE, the proposal has been generally rejected by the Arab world as well as several European countries, which have accused Trump of wanting to 'ethnically cleanse' Gaza and keep insisting that it must be part of a future Palestinian state. Israeli officials who enthusiastically support the incipient plan have said that Palestinians would be allowed to return but only if they believed in peaceful coexistence with the Jewish state. Akunis, a member of the Likud party, also made clear that he does not believe in giving the Palestinians a state of their own, especially after what Hamas did as rulers of the Strip over the last two decades. 'Gaza was a Palestinian state,' he noted. 'Do you think that the Israelis should accept the idea of the same terror state in Judea and Samaria and in the Gaza Strip again? The answer is no.'

Two Israeli-Arabs planning attacks for Hamas arrested	Investigators believe the brothers were preparing for a 'military confrontation' against Israel. By Pesach Benson, TPS Two brothers from the Israeli Arab city of Arraba were arrested and indicted for preparing to carry out a terror attack for Hamas, it was cleared for publication on Monday. The suspects, Yusef and Hadi Nasser, are accused of acquiring military equipment and learning to build explosive devices in preparation for a terror attack, the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) said. Investigators believe the brothers were preparing for a 'military confrontation' against Israel. This case is part of a broader effort by security forces to thwart attacks inspired by Hamas since the war began. Multiple investigations have been launched against Israeli citizens suspected of supporting terrorist activities. 'The General Security Service and the Israel Police view with great seriousness any involvement of Israeli citizens in activities that endanger the security of the state, and will continue to take the measures at their disposal to thwart any threat and act to bring all those involved to justice,' the Shin Bet said. The Haifa District Attorney’s Office has now filed indictments against the two for preparation for an act of terrorism, as well as training and instruction for terrorist purposes.

Cannabis brings relief to growing number of trauma victims post O...	Approximately 20,000 Israelis are already using medical cannabis for PTSD, representing 15% of the country’s medical cannabis prescriptions. By Jewish Breaking News As thousands of new PTSD cases emerge in the wake of October 7, promising research on cannabis treatment for trauma survivors has taken on new urgency. Following combat veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD, researchers at Tel Aviv University found significant symptom improvement in patients using medical cannabis, with more than 65% experiencing at least a 20% reduction in their PTSD symptoms. Notably, participants showed marked improvements in sleep quality and duration, along with reductions in intrusive thoughts and hyperarousal symptoms. Research shows that PTSD patients often have lower levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) that help regulate stress and emotional memories. THC, the primary active ingredient in cannabis, helps improve sleep quality, reduce nightmares, and lower anxiety in most cases. CBD, the non-intoxicating compound, reduces anxiety, counters potential negative effects of THC, and has calming properties. Together, they target brain areas involved in fear, memory, and stress response. 'What we’re seeing is particularly relevant given the current crisis,' Dr. Segal of medical cannabis producer Panaxia tells Globes. 'We see that this is a treatment that helps patients escape rather than resolve trauma, but that relief is also very important.' Approximately 20,000 Israelis are already using medical cannabis for PTSD, representing 15% of the country’s medical cannabis prescriptions. While the research shows promise, experts emphasize caution. Dr. Gilad Bodenheimer, head of mental health services at Israel’s Ministry of Health, cautions that it 'has not been proven to be a substance that is effective for PTSD,' adding that careful consideration is needed when prescribing any substance with potential risks. The brutal reality of October 7 has left thousands scarred for life, creating a mental health crisis of historic proportions. While no research can fully address trauma of this magnitude, the study’s findings about cannabis treatment offer at least a glimmer of hope for Israel’s traumatized survivors.

Hamas reportedly willing to hand over Gaza to Palestinian Authori...	Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas meets World Jewish Congress leader, pushing bid for Ramallah to take control over the Gaza Strip after Hamas reportedly agrees to cede the area. By World Israel News Staff The Hamas terror organization has agreed to yield control over the Gaza Strip to the Palestinian Authority, according to unnamed sources cited by Sky News Arabia in a report published Sunday night. The sources claimed that Hamas had told government employees in the Gaza Strip that they will be 're-absorbed into the new administration,' run by the Palestinian Authority, 'or that they would retire, with a guarantee that their salaries be paid.' Hamas is said to have agreed to surrender control over the coastal enclave to Ramallah following intense pressure from Egypt. The Egyptian government is said to have pressed a Hamas delegation during its recent trip to Cairo, in a bid to secure an alternative to President Donald Trump's plan to resettle the entire population in third-party countries, including Egypt and Jordan. The Palestinian Authority is also working to promote its rule of Gaza as an alternative to the Trump plan. On Sunday, Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas met with World Jewish Congress President Ron Lauder in Amman, Jordan. During their meeting, the PA mouthpiece WAFA reported, Abbas reiterated his opposition to the Trump plan, as well as to any possible transfer or mass migration of Arabs out of Judea and Samaria. Instead, Abbas argued, Ramallah should be charged with governing the post-war Gaza Strip, and called for increased international humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, as well as aid to rebuild the coastal enclave. The Gaza Strip was administered by the Palestinian Authority from 1994, after Israel withdrew from parts of the Strip, until Hamas seized the area in 2007, defeating Fatah loyalists.

Eyal Zamir confirmed as Israeli military’s Chief of Staff	The last time chief of staff to leave the post before the end of his term was Lt.-Gen. Dan Halutz, who resigned in 2007 over IDF failures during the Second Lebanon War of 2006. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Israeli government gave its approval for the appointment of Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir as the next Israel Defense Forces chief of staff on Sunday. Zamir will replace Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi, who announced on Jan. 21 he would resign over the military’s October 7 failures. Halevi is due to step down on March 5. Zamir, 59, was born and raised in Eilat. He would become the Chief of Staff to begin his career in the Armored Corps. After joining the army in 1984 he became a tank commander, gradually climbing the ranks. He was eventually appointed as Netanyahu’s military secretary from 2012-2015. From 2018 to 2021, he was deputy chief of staff before becoming a visiting research fellow at the Washington-based Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Zamir was also considered for the Chief of Staff in 2018 and 2022. In 2023, he was appointed Director General of the Defense Ministry. He also has degrees from Tel Aviv and Haifa Universities and is a graduate of Wharton University’s General Management Program. The IDF Chief of Staff serves for three years with the possibility of a one-year extension. The last time chief of staff to leave the post before the end of his term was Lt.-Gen. Dan Halutz, who resigned in 2007 over IDF failures during the Second Lebanon War of 2006. There have been growing calls for the government to appoint an independent commission of inquiry to investigate political and military failures. Such commissions have broader authority to summon witnesses and collect evidence and are headed by a senior Supreme Court justice. They may include personal recommendations about individuals under investigation, though the government is not bound to act on the recommendations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the governing coalition say an independent commission should only be appointed after the war. The last state commission of inquiry, which investigated Israel’s worst civilian disaster — a stampede that killed 45 people at a holy site on Mount Meron — held Netanyahu personally responsible for the tragedy in a report released in April.

Despairing of rescue, hostage prayed girlfriend would move on	Sasha Troufanov, released on Saturday, did not believe he’d survive Hamas captivity. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Sapir Cohen, the partner of Sasha Troufanov who was freed on Saturday, told a press gathering Sunday night at Sheba Hospital that he had he had prayed she’d find someone else as he never expected to survive. 'Sasha told me that he prayed for me, that I would find a man I love, that I would not wait for him,' she relayed, voice shaking. 'He did not want me to wait for a man who would never come home. He did not believe that he would come out alive.' Troufanov spent his entire captivity alone, almost all of it in tunnels under Khan Yunis, where he was sometimes left chained in the dark. He was starved, and abused both physically and mentally. Cohen, whom Hamas terrorists had abducted along with Troufanov and his mother and grandmother from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the October 7, 2023 invasion, said that since that day she has managed to 'fulfill dreams I never thought I’d have – to return alive from captivity in Gaza and to hug Sasha again.' The three women were released in the first hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, some seven weeks into the war, when 82 female and underage Israelis were freed over the course of a week in exchange for a temporary ceasefire, 246 Palestinian prisoners, and humanitarian aid that has flowed into the Strip ever since. Cohen thanked all the troops who fought in Gaza, and the families of the fallen, saying that 'to call you soldiers is to minimize what you do, a thousand-fold. You are role models who show what unity is, what solidarity is. Thank you for showing us that this is possible.' She also expressed special gratitude to everyone who gave strength and hope to the hostages’ families, 'each in their own way,' saying that she 'thanked God every day for the privilege I was given to meet so many good people.' Troufanov’s mother, Yelena, whose husband was murdered by Hamas terrorists on October 7, said, 'I feel like I have received my life, my soul, my heart back' with her son’s return, calling it a 'miracle' that although he’d been shot in both legs when he was abducted, he could stand and walk. Avital Dekel-Chen, wife of Sagui who was freed along with Troufanov, told the gathered journalists that her husband 'did not see daylight since October 7,' and didn’t know what had happened to his family until the day before he was released. He managed to hold on and not give up hope, she said, 'thanks to love.' But it was extremely hard to survive for nearly 17 months, she said, relaying that he had told her, 'It's nice that they write 498 days, but basically it's more correct to say that we've been there for over 43 million seconds of hell.' 'They don't count days or hours, they count seconds,' she emphasized. All the family members who spoke said it was of the utmost importance for all the rest of the hostages to be freed, no matter the cost. Hamas is still holding 73 captives, 35 of whom are known to be dead. Three of them have been held in Gaza for a decade or more: Two mentally ill young men, Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who wandered into the Strip in 2014 and 2015 respectively, and Hadar Goldin, a soldier killed in 2014’s Operation Protective Edge, whose body was stolen. The two who are alive are on the list to be freed in the last part of Phase 1 of the current hostage deal.

Israel hits Hezbollah rocket launchers, weapons in Lebanon	Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri announced on Thursday that Beirut rejects Israel’s plan to maintain a presence in five locations in Southern Lebanon after this Tuesday’s ceasefire expiration date (Feb. 18). By JNS The Israeli Air Force on Sunday evening carried out strikes on multiple Hezbollah sites in Lebanon housing rocket launchers and weapons, according to the Israeli military. The Israel Defense Forces emphasized that the presence of terrorist infrastructure at these locations violated agreements between Jerusalem and Beirut, and stated that Israel remains committed to neutralizing any threats to its security. An IAF strike in Southern Lebanon on Saturday night killed Hezbollah operative Abbas Ahmad Hamoud, who was responsible for overseeing the Iranian-backed terror group’s aerial force. After reports from Lebanese media that Israeli aircraft carried out three airstrikes in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, the Israel Defense Force (IDF) has confirmed that the Israeli Air Force (IAF) carried out strikes on Hezbollah facilities that contained rocket launchers and other… pic.twitter.com/FazPC6CAey &mdash; OSINTdefender (@sentdefender) February 16, 2025 Hamoud was targeted after repeatedly violating the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire, including by launching UAVs toward Israeli territory, according to the IDF. Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri announced on Thursday that Beirut rejects Israel’s plan to maintain a presence in five locations in Southern Lebanon after this Tuesday’s ceasefire expiration date (Feb. 18). According to Berri, the United States, acting as a mediator, informed him that Israel would withdraw from certain villages but intended to remain in five strategic points. Berri, an ally of Hezbollah, stated that he had conveyed Lebanon’s complete rejection of this proposal on behalf of Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam. Under the ceasefire agreement, Israeli forces are to gradually withdraw from Southern Lebanon as the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) assume responsibility for ensuring Hezbollah remains disarmed south of the Litani River. However, there has been growing concern in Jerusalem regarding the LAF’s ability to effectively curb Hezbollah’s presence. In response, the IDF continues frequent border operations to prevent the group from regaining strength, including intelligence gathering, reconnaissance and clearing terrain to disrupt terrorist movements. The ceasefire, which took effect on Nov. 27, mandated an Israeli withdrawal within 60 days. However, the U.S.-monitored arrangement between Lebanon and Israel is set to continue until Feb. 18, according to a White House statement on Jan. 26.

Report: UNRWA illegally operational in Jerusalem	On Oct. 28, the Knesset passed, by large majorities, two laws banning UNRWA following the exposure of UNRWA staff complicity in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, and despite pressure from the United States under former president Joe Biden. By JNS The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) remains operational in eastern Jerusalem despite its outlawing there and throughout Israel last month, an Israeli radio station reported on Sunday. Senior UNRWA staff have left Israel and Judea and Samaria because the outlawing of the agency risked compromising their freedom of movement, Kan 11 reported. The organization’s two headquarters in Jerusalem have also closed down. But schools and other UNRWA facilities in eastern Jerusalem and beyond remain open and operational, according to the report. Laws that ban UNRWA in Israel went into effect on Jan. 30, making it illegal for UNRWA to maintain a presence or activities in Israel and prohibiting Israeli officials from engaging in contact with the agency. 'This is inconceivable,' Shai Glick, CEO of the right-wing human rights group b’Tsalmo wrote on X. 'We will physically come there and close the place down no matter what happens! We will not allow terrorism free range in Jerusalem,' he added. On Oct. 28, the Knesset passed, by large majorities, two laws banning UNRWA following the exposure of UNRWA staff complicity in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, and despite pressure from the United States under former president Joe Biden. The language of the ban was by far the most robust ever used by Israel against the agency, whose largest donors have been the United States and the European Union. UNRWA has for decades been accused of providing cover and income to Palestinian terrorists while undermining peace efforts, including via its schools’ curriculum. According to Israel, hundreds of UNRWA workers have engaged in terrorism in recent years, including the killers of Yonatan Samerano, an Israeli soldier slain on Oct. 7, 2023, whose body was taken to Gaza. Israel identified one of his kidnappers as UNRWA social worker Faisal Ali Mussalem al Naami. On Jan. 20, President Donald Trump temporarily suspended U.S. foreign aid to UNRWA, pending reviews of existing development programs. UNRWA caters to several millions of people it defines as refugees in Judea and Samaria, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. Through UNRWA, the United Nations employs a unique refugee definition for Palestinians. UNRWA defines as refugees not only those who fled the war in 1948 but their descendants in perpetuity until a 'just solution' emerges for their status. The United Nations has a different definition for all other refugees, who cannot give the title to their descendants and often lose it when they are naturalized elsewhere. Critics of the UNRWA definition argue that it’s designed to perpetuate the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

Netanyahu rules out alternatives to Trump’s Gaza plan	Trump has presented 'the only plan that can work,' says Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, emphasizing desire of Palestinian Arabs to leave the Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lobbied on behalf of President Donald Trump's Gaza resettlement plan on Sunday, urging American Jewish leaders to back the proposal to find new homes for the roughly two million Gazans currently living in the coastal enclave. On Sunday evening, Netanyahu addressed the Conference of Major American Jewish Organizations, lauding President Trump's policies vis-a-vis Israel, while touting Israel's accomplishments in the 15-month war on Hamas. Working with the Trump administration, Netanyahu vowed to 'change' the Middle East, continuing the transformation begun after October 7th. 'Within a year and some months, the courage of our soldiers, the stalwart position of our people and the decisions that we made turned things around. We decimated much of Hamas,' Netanyahu said. 'We haven't finished the job, we will. Israel will destroy Hamas' military and governing capabilities; Gaza will look differently.' 'We changed the Middle East,' Netanyahu continued. 'Now comes President Trump, and Secretary Rubio, who's a great friend of Israel as well. I've seen him over the years, and we had a great discussion today. And we talked about how do we complete the change in the Middle East.' 'We have the greatest friend of Israel in the White House now. We have, we see eye to eye on the main tasks that we have to accomplish, and we're in a position to change the Middle East and give Israel the kind of horizon, the kind of hope, the kind of security and the kind of peace that would have been unimaginable, and in fact was unimaginable from the day of the founding of the State of Israel.' The Israeli premier said Israel is on the cusp of 'victories' greater than any before in its history, including the Six Day War. 'We intend to pursue them to the full.' Trump's proposal to resettle the entire population of the Gaza Strip in third-party countries, Netanyahu said, is a 'bold new vision and the only plan that I think can work.' Defending Trump's plan from accusations of ethnic cleansing, Netanyahu argued that most Gazans want to leave the Gaza Strip. 'Why not give Gazans a choice? Everybody said this is the largest open-air prison in the world. Not because of us. We let people leave.' 'In fact, if you want to know, over the last couple of years, two years I think, 150,000 Gazans left. You know how they left? Because they bribed their way out, not through us. They bribed their way out.' 'The rich could leave, but if other people wanted to leave, give them a choice, not forcible eviction, not ethnic cleansing. In a war zone people leave.' 'We tried to get the population to leave, to get them out of harm's way, and Hamas, with rifles, with gunfire, tried to prevent them from leaving. So we moved them around so that they would get out of harm's way. But if people want to leave, if they want to emigrate, it's their choice. And I think President Trump's plan is right on the dot.'

Trump to Netanyahu: ‘Do whatever you want’ in Gaza	After Hamas flouts his ultimatum, releasing just three hostages over the weekend, President Trump says Israel has discretion how to respond. By World Israel News Staff President Donald Trump gave Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a green light to take whatever course of action Israel deems necessary against the Hamas terror organization, after Hamas ignored Trump's ultimatum last week. Speaking at the Daytona 500 on Sunday, the president noted that while Hamas had not released all the remaining hostages on Saturday as he had demanded last week, three hostages - including a dual Israeli-American citizen - were returned to Israel. 'Now, the reason I made that statement was because [Hamas] said they weren't going to deliver, they were not going to deliver the people that they said they were going to deliver, that they agreed to deliver,' Trump explained. 'When I made the statement, they delivered everybody plus an American.' 'Now, the good news is they look like they're in pretty good shape because the people from the week before didn't look like they were in good shape. They looked like Holocaust survivors, frankly. Horrible. Whatever happened to them was horrible.' Last week, after Hamas threatened to delay the release of hostages slated for return to Israel on Saturday, Trump warned that 'all hell is going to break out' if Hamas does not free all remaining hostages by noon on Saturday. Netanyahu threatened to resume the war in the Gaza Strip if Hamas did not release Israeli hostages, but did not specify how many Israel would need to avert a return to the war. In his statement on Sunday, Trump said it would be 'up to Israel' to respond to the limited hostage release, adding that Netanyahu can 'do whatever you want' with regards to the war in Gaza. 'That will be up to Israel, what the next step is - in consultation with me,' Trump said. 'I told Bibi, you do whatever you want because, you know, my statement was they've got to come back.'

‘We won’t fight for surrender deals’ – IDF soldiers slam Gaza tru...	There is no moral justification for sending us to risk our lives on land that will later be handed over to the enemy,' wrote the soldiers. By World Israel News Staff A group of Israeli soldiers blasted the current ceasefire in Gaza, writing in an open letter to IDF leadership that they were demotivated by the decision to pause the fight against the Hamas terror group. The soldiers, reservists from the Northern Command's Carmeli Brigade, which was stationed in Gaza for a significant part of the Israel-Hamas war, wrote of their frustration with the decision to strike a deal with Hams. 'We do not want to be cannon fodder for deals of surrender,' the soldiers wrote, referring to the current ceasefire and hostage exchange agreement, according to a copy of the letter obtained by KAN News. The soldiers also stressed the importance of seizing land from Hamas, including the creation of a permanent buffer zone in Gaza, in order to protect Israeli civilians. 'How can we have the motivation to return, fight, and risk our lives in operational activities on land that will be handed back to our enemy in a few days? We're not ready to go home, either disabled [from battle wounds] or in coffins, when all our efforts will only serve as leverage for deals to release terrorists,' they added. The soldiers said they were proud to go into battle with the mission of securing a decisive victory over Hamas, but warned that they would be far less willing to put their lives on the line if their efforts would only lead to further prisoner exchanges and concessions towards the terror group. 'We are ready to stand and risk our lives again and again if we know for certain that the purpose of our stand is to fight, defeat, and vanquish the enemy,' they wrote. But, they emphasized, 'there is no moral justification for sending us to risk our lives on land that will later be handed over to the enemy.'

Day 500 of the war: IDF casualties by the numbers	Since October 7th, 2023, 894 members of the security forces, including soldiers, police officers, and members of intelligence agencies, have been killed in combat. By World Israel News Staff Thousands of Israeli security personnel are grappling with physical and mental injuries sustained in the ongoing war, according to a new report from Hebrew-language outlet Ma'ariv. The report, which leveraged data obtained from the Israeli army and the Defense Ministry’s Rehabilitation Department, revealed the staggering toll of the fighting, which began with Hamas' October 7th, 2023, terror onslaught. Since that day, 894 members of the security forces, including soldiers, police officers, and members of intelligence agencies, have been killed in combat. Approximately 15,000 have been wounded, with that number including both those physically injured and suffering from debilitating mental issues. According to the report, some 8,600 were wounded physically, and 7,600 are facing psychological challenges, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. The statistics indicated that there is a significant number of security forces who sustained both physical and mental injuries simultaneously. Notably, 66 percent of those wounded in combat are reserve soldiers, compared to 17 percent being combat soldiers performing their mandatory service. 10 percent of those wounded were police officers, many of whom sprang into action on October 7th with little training or arms relevant for the scale of the battles. Half of those wounded were between the ages of 18 to 29, with an additional 30 percent aged between 30 to 39. The remaining 20 percent of casualties were age 40 and older. A recent report from the State Comptroller warned that Israel must do more to support traumatized soldiers and civilians, who are also facing mental health challenges after some 15 months of war. The government 'has not done enough to address the anticipated mental health challenges,' the report states, adding that 'no fewer than 3 million Israelis may develop symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD as a result of the war.'

Teacher tells students: Blame Netanyahu for hostage deal issues	Civics teacher says that Netanyahu, not Hamas, is at fault for missed opportunities to secure a hostage deal. By World Israel News Staff The Education Ministry has opened an investigation into a high school teacher who told her students that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, not Hamas, is at fault for the challenges around the completion of the current ceasefire and hostage exchange deal. In a recording made by a student in the classroom, which was leaked to Channel 14 News, the civics teacher from the central city of Ra'anana - whose name has not been publicly revealed - is heard telling students that they are mistaken if they believe Netanyahu is prioritizing freeing the hostages. When a student said that Netanyahu is attempting to bring back the hostages, the teacher is heard saying, 'Is he really trying?' After the student pushed back and said that the premier is trying to secure the captives' freedom, the teacher replied that 'according to everything we know, he's not trying.' The teacher added that 'as of right now, there was no deal that [Netanyahu] didn't blow up.' Numerous students responded by telling the teacher that it was Hamas, not Netanyahu, who had sabotaged opportunities for a deal. 'You all really believe that it was Hamas?' the teacher is heard asking incredulously, implying that they were naive for believing that the terror group is less trustworthy than the prime minister. In additional recordings, the teacher can be heard falsely claiming that Communications Minister Shloma Karai had called for the murder of Attorney Gali Baharav Miara. While Karai has been critical of Barharav Miara, he has never called for her killing. 'As stated, this is an extremely serious incident. Injecting political propaganda and fostering social divisions in the classroom directly contradicts the ministry's values, procedures, and the minister's directives,' the Education Ministry said in a media statement. 'It is important to note that the teacher denies the allegations, and we have not yet received the recordings documenting the incident. The matter will be thoroughly investigated and addressed significantly, based on the findings.' Several hours later, Education Minister Yoav Kisch made an additional comment to Channel 14 News after listening to the recordings. 'I was shocked by the teacher's remarks,' Kisch said, promising the outlet that his ministry is handling the incident with the utmost seriousness. 'The days of spreading hatred and division under the auspices of the education system are over,' he added.

Trump gives Iran a deadline to close its nuclear program	The United States is actively seeking direct and confidential negotiations with Iran, according to the same diplomatic source. By JBN The clock is ticking for Iran to shut down its nuclear program. 'The Trump administration is trying to reach an agreement with Iran before October. However, if this agreement is not achieved, the region will face a serious crisis,' a European diplomat tells Dubai based Al-Hadath. But behind the scenes, American officials are pushing for a diplomatic solution. The United States is actively seeking direct and confidential negotiations with Iran, according to the same diplomatic source. 'Maybe they are trying to get new defense as we speak but their defense is largely gone… Iran is very nervous. I think they’re scared. I would love to make a deal with them without bombing them,' Trump stated during a recent Fox News appearance. 'Everybody thinks Israel with our help or our approval will go in and bomb the hell out of them,' he said. 'I would prefer that not happen. I’d much rather see a deal with Iran where we can do a deal, supervise, check it, inspect it.' Despite dismissing rumors of joint military action with Israel, Trump is tightening the economic screws. On February 4, he signed an executive order reviving his 'maximum pressure policy' aimed at strangling Iran’s oil exports. Once bolstered by sophisticated Russian air defense systems, Iran now finds itself exposed after Israeli strikes last October reportedly destroyed its remaining S-300 missile installations. Tehran has categorically denied any such reports. 'The reality is that in war, clashes happen. But the idea that our defense system has weakened or, as some ignorant individuals say, has been destroyed, is absolutely false,' said Brigadier General Mahdi Farahi as quoted by Iran International. 'Our defense system, in terms of deployment, diversity, and capabilities, has not only not weakened but has become even stronger since before the Zionist regime’s aggression.' Meanwhile, Iran’s nuclear ambitions are becoming an increasingly open topic of discussion within the country. The shift became apparent in late October 2024 after the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ newspaper made waves by calling for Iran to rethink its nuclear strategy, citing Israel’s use of 'devastating military technology to establish a new order.' The debate spread quickly. A week later, 39 members of parliament sent a letter to the Supreme National Security Council pushing for the same reassessment.

Doctors give Netanyahu a clean bill of health in spite of recent ...	His medical team stressed that there is no indication of prostate cancer and that the tissue removed during the recent surgery in December was benign. By Pesach Benson, TPS A recently published document has provided details on the medical condition of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, following a year of multiple medical procedures. The document marks the first full medical report on the 75-year-old Prime Minister’s health since 2016. The document, which outlines Netanyahu’s medical history and current condition, is not an official government health report but rather a summary compiled by his personal medical team. According to the report signed by the Prime Minister’s private physician, Dr. Zvi Berkowitz along with Prof. Alon Pikarsky and Prof. Ehud Grossman, Netanyahu is in good health. His blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels are within normal ranges, and comprehensive laboratory tests, including kidney and liver function assessments, showed no abnormalities. The report confirmed that Netanyahu has been undergoing routine colonoscopy screenings, with the latest results indicating no abnormalities. His medical team stressed that there is no indication of prostate cancer and that the tissue removed during the recent surgery in December was benign. The procedure led to a two-week pause in Netanyahu’s corruption trial. Despite the ongoing urinary infection, his doctors assert that his overall health remains stable and that he is receiving appropriate treatment. The medical report noted that Netanyahu underwent a pacemaker implantation in July 2023 due to a conduction block. According to Prof. Roy Beinert, director of the Institute for Arrhythmias at Sheba Medical Center, Netanyahu has not shown signs of heart rhythm disturbances since the procedure and is not dependent on the pacemaker. Regular cardiological evaluations have determined that the device is functioning properly and that Netanyahu is stable from a cardiac standpoint, requiring only routine monitoring. In April 2024, Netanyahu underwent surgery to repair a right inguinal hernia. Prior to the procedure, a full-body CT scan revealed an enlarged prostate, small stones in the bladder, and an obstructive bladder disorder. Subsequently, on December 29, 2024, he underwent laser surgery to remove benign prostate tissue. His doctors noted that the surgery went as expected, though he has been dealing with a persistent urinary tract infection since the procedure. He remains on antibiotic treatment, and his doctors have recommended a gradual return to full activity. Following the prostate surgery, Netanyahu made headlines when he left the Hadassah Ein Kerem Medical Center over the objections of his doctors to personally cast his vote over the 'Trapped Profits Law.' It passed by a vote of 59-58. Netanyahu was accompanied by Berkowitz in the Knesset plenum. Itamar Ben-Gvir subsequently apologized to Netanyahu and MK Boaz Bismuth, who was forced to interrupt a week of mourning for his mother to cast his vote. Failure to pass the bill could have jeopardized approval of the state budget later, or potentially create a 10-billion-shekel deficit ($2.74 billion).

The plan provides for reconstruction over three to five years, without the displacement of the Palestinian population and without Hamas control. The Algemeiner and i24 News Arab countries will unveil their plan for the reconstruction of Gaza on February 27 in Cairo. This initiative, developed by the Palestinians and handed over to the Egyptians for implementation, will be presented to the leaders of Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. The plan provides for reconstruction over three to five years, without the displacement of the Palestinian population and without Hamas control. The funding, estimated at several hundred million dollars, will come from Gulf countries. The work will be carried out by Egyptian companies, representing a significant source of income for Egypt, which is strongly opposed to any migration of Palestinians out of Gaza. The workforce will consist mainly of local Palestinians. 'The goal is to marginalize Hamas so that it understands that it has lost control of Gaza, and to completely eliminate the terrorist organization’s grip on the population and the territory within 5 years from the start of reconstruction,' a source involved in the plan said. An independent 'Palestinian administration,' separate from the Palestinian Authority but relying on it, will oversee the reconstruction. This power structure is designed to get the approval of Israel and the United States, who refuse direct management by the Palestinian Authority. Arab countries fear a resurgence of fighting by Israel, which could, in their view, favor US President Donald Trump’s plan to move Palestinians to neighboring countries. The former US president said he wanted to see Jordan, Egypt, and other Arab countries welcome more displaced people from Gaza, so that the war-torn area can be 'cleaned up.' According to analyzed satellite images, approximately 65% of the buildings in Gaza have been destroyed during the war. Experts estimate that reconstruction could take more than a decade and cost several hundred billion dollars.

Vance lambasted European leaders on Friday, accusing them of censoring free speech and criticizing German mainstream parties’ 'firewall' against the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). By Reuters and Algemeiner Staff German Chancellor Olaf Scholz delivered a strong rebuke on Saturday to US Vice President JD Vance’s attack on Europe’s stance toward hate speech and the far right, saying it was not right for others to tell Germany and Europe what to do. Vance lambasted European leaders on Friday, the first day of the Munich Security Conference, accusing them of censoring free speech and criticizing German mainstream parties’ 'firewall' against the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). 'That is not appropriate, especially not among friends and allies. We firmly reject that,' Scholz told the conference on Saturday, adding there were 'good reasons' not to work with the AfD. The anti-immigration party, currently polling at around 20% ahead of Germany’s February 23 national election, has pariah status among other major German parties in a country with a taboo about ultranationalist politics because of its Nazi past. 'Never again fascism, never again racism, never again aggressive war. That is why an overwhelming majority in our country opposes anyone who glorifies or justifies criminal National Socialism,' Scholz said, referring to the ideology of Adolf Hitler’s 1933-45 Nazi regime. Vance met on Friday with the leader of AfD, after endorsing the party as a political partner — a stance Berlin dismissed as unwelcome election interference. Referring more broadly to Vance’s criticism of Europe’s curtailing of hate speech, which he has likened to censorship, Scholz said: 'Today’s democracies in Germany and Europe are founded on the historic awareness and realization that democracies can be destroyed by radical anti-democrats. 'And this is why we’ve created institutions that ensure that our democracies can defend themselves against their enemies, and rules that do not restrict or limit our freedom but protect it.' French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot added his voice to the defense of Europe’s stance on hate speech. 'No one is required to adopt our model but no one can impose theirs on us,' Barrot said on X from Munich. 'Freedom of speech is guaranteed in Europe.' UKRAINE The prospect of talks to end the Ukraine-Russia war had been expected to dominate the annual Munich conference after a phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week, but Vance barely mentioned Russia or Ukraine in his speech to the gathering on Friday. Instead, he said the threat to Europe that worried him most was not Russia or China but what he called a retreat from fundamental values of protecting free speech – as well as immigration, which he said was 'out of control' in Europe. Many conference delegates watched Vance’s speech in stunned silence. There was little applause as he delivered his remarks. Asked by the panel moderator if he thought there was anything in Vance’s speech worth reflecting on, Scholz drew laughter and applause in the crowd when he responded, in a deadpan manner: 'You mean all these very relevant discussions about Ukraine and security in Europe?'

Israel’s UN Ambassador Leiter says Egypt’s military buildup will ...	Egypt has constructed military bases in Sinai 'that can only be used for offensive operations, for offensive weapons—that’s a clear violation,' said Leiter. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Israeli Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter has accused Egypt of 'very serious' violations of its 45-year-old peace treaty with the Jewish state, saying the government in Jerusalem would table Cairo’s military buildup in Sinai 'very soon.' Egypt has constructed military bases in Sinai 'that can only be used for offensive operations, for offensive weapons—that’s a clear violation,' Leiter said in his first meeting with American Jewish organizations on Jan. 28, a recording of which was shared online by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations on Friday. Egypt’s breach 'is an issue that is going to come to the fore because it’s not tolerable,' the Israeli diplomatic envoy explained. 'For a long time, it’s been shunted aside, and this continues. This is going to be an issue that we’re going to put on the table very soon and very emphatically.' Satellite images indicating changes in Egyptian army deployment in the Sinai Peninsula have reportedly led security coordinators in Israeli border towns to paint a worrying picture of recent developments. IDF Lt. Col. (res.) Eliyahu Dekel, who has monitored Cairo’s adherence to the peace deal since it was signed in 1979, told Israel Hayom last week that 'if the latest images are verified, the concern isn’t just about forces in Sinai, the key issue is the type of tanks. The images show Abrams tanks, which are Egypt’s premier battle tanks, reserved for elite units. 'The question arises: What are these special forces doing in Sinai? In recent years, three new airfields have been built in Sinai, and massive tunnels have been dug, blatantly violating the peace treaty. The treaty allows for military camps for 47 battalions; currently, there are camps for 180 battalions, four times the permitted amount.' In recent days, Cairo’s official rhetoric has escalated in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan for relocating Palestinians from Gaza. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has made clear that he will not allow the move to happen, even postponing a planned visit to the White House. In his speech to the Conference of Presidents, Leiter said Sisi 'plays both sides of the equation, but he is threatened by the Muslim Brotherhood.' If the Israeli military decisively defeats the Muslim Brotherhood branch in the Gaza Strip—Hamas—Sisi is 'going to be more open to cooperate with us on the ‘day after’ Hamas,' he argued. The Israeli envoy called it 'unconscionable that Egypt wouldn’t entertain the possibility of at least temporarily housing some of the [Palestinian] refugees, particularly in light of the fact that members of Sisi’s family are running a travel agency in which they take tens of thousands of dollars from Gazans who want to get out of the area.' On Sunday, Sisi told World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder that the establishment of a Palestinian state in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip is 'the only guarantee' for lasting peace in the Middle East. During the meeting with the Jewish leader in Cairo, Sisi called for the reconstruction of the war-torn Strip 'without displacing its residents from their land,' according to a statement published by his office. According to the readout from the Egyptian presidency, Lauder for his part praised Cairo’s 'wise efforts' to restore stability in the Middle East.

Israel in ‘full cooperation’ with Trump, say Netanyahu, Rubio	Netanyahu: 'We have a shared strategy, which cannot always be detailed to the public—including when the gates of hell will open. And they will open if all our hostages are not returned, every last one of them.' By Joshua Marks, JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is working closely with President Donald Trump, according to a joint statement released on Sunday with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. 'Contrary to what is being reported, President Trump and I are working in full cooperation and coordination,' the prime minister told Rubio, according to the statement. 'We have a shared strategy, which cannot always be detailed to the public—including when the gates of hell will open. And they will open if all our hostages are not returned, every last one of them,' it continued. According to a statement from his office on Saturday, Netanyahu will convene the Security Cabinet 'soon' to discuss Jerusalem’s response to Trump’s call for the Hamas terrorist group in Gaza to release all of the hostages it is holding. Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel’s commitment to securing the release of all hostages, dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities and eliminating the threat from Gaza. For his part, the top American diplomat stressed at a press conference alongside the Israeli premier that the Jewish state has had no stronger ally in the White House than Trump. Rubio emphasized that the hostages must be released and reiterated that Hamas cannot continue as a military or governing force in Gaza, saying that the terrorist group 'must be eliminated.' On Syria, he stressed that replacing one destabilizing force with another is not the solution. With regard to Lebanon, he stated that 'we share the same goal: a strong Lebanese state capable of disarming Hezbollah.' Rubio maintained that the ayatollahs’ regime in Tehran is the source of all the instability in the Middle East, saying that this must be addressed and stressing that Iran must never have nuclear weapons. He praised the Jewish state, saying, 'Founded after a horrifying crime against humanity, Israel stands as a beacon to the world. More nations like Israel in the Middle East would make the world safer,' adding that 'Israel seeks peace but won’t be intimidated by its enemies.' Netanyahu offered Rubio a warm welcome, saying it was 'great to welcome you to Jerusalem as secretary of state,' hailing Trump again as 'the greatest friend Israel has ever had at the White House,' and reflecting on his recent visit to Washington. Netanyahu said that he had had a 'very production discussion' with Rubio in a private meeting at his Jerusalem office before participating in an extended diplomatic exchange with their teams. Netanyahu emphasized that Iran was the No. 1 topic of the conversations. 'Israel and America stand shoulder to shoulder in countering the threat of Iran. We agreed that the ayatollahs must not have nuclear weapons,' said Netanyahu. 'We also agreed that Iran’s aggression in the region has to be rolled back,' adding that over the past 16 months, Israel 'has dealt a mighty blow to Iran’s terror axis. 'Under the strong leadership of President Trump and with your unflinching support, I have no doubt that we can and will finish the job,' he added. He thanked Trump for helping to secure the release of three more hostages on Saturday, after Hamas had earlier said they would not be freed on time. 'I also thanked him for America’s unequivocal backing for Israel’s policy in Gaza in moving forward,' said Netanyahu. Netanyahu also said he and Rubio had discussed Trump’s 'bold plan for Gaza' and how to make it a reality. Turning to Lebanon, Netanyahu called the weekend attacks on UNIFIL forces by Hezbollah supporters in Beirut 'concerning,' saying that Hezbollah must be disarmed and that 'Israel will take necessary measures to enforce the ceasefire and ensure its security.' He praised Trump for reinstating his executive order against the International Criminal Court and sanctioning its officials, saying that he discussed with Rubio countering threats from anti-American and anti-Israel international forums. Netanyahu said that he talked with Rubio 'about working together to formulate a common strategy to deal with the threat of lawfare and neutralize this threat once and for all. 'There are significant challenges and opportunities. By working together, America and Israel will overcome obstacles and capitalize on opportunities. The best is yet to come,' Netanyahu said. Rubio touched down in Israel on Saturday night for his first visit to the Jewish state since being confirmed as America’s top diplomat. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar greeted Rubio on the tarmac at Ben-Gurion International Airport. The two counterparts toured the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem on Sunday. Rubio and Sa’ar in their talks discussed strengthening ties with Abraham Accords countries, relocating embassies to Jerusalem, legal challenges to Israel’s self-defense, combating antisemitism, boosting U.S.-Israel economic relations, and implementing Trump’s 'connectivity' vision. They agreed to maintain open dialogue and plan Sa’ar’s visit to Washington soon. The American diplomat also met with other high-ranking officials, including President Isaac Herzog and opposition leader Yair Lapid. 'It’s an honor to be back as the secretary of state, not even four weeks into the job. I wanted this one to be one of our first visits because of the issues before us, and also because of the friendship and solidarity between our two countries,' Rubio said ahead of the meeting with Herzog. 'On behalf of the [U.S.] president, I can tell you he’s strongly and deeply committed to the goal of every single hostage returning home, every single one, and not resting, not being silent, not forgetting, till all of them our home,' according to Washington’s top diplomat. Herzog said, 'Shalom, our dear friend, Secretary of State Marco Rubio. We are honored to have you in our midst, in our country, you have no idea how much it means to us in these challenging days and times that our nation has gone through and endured since October 7, [2023]. 'We are grateful to President Donald Trump for his friendship and solidarity with the people of Israel and the State of Israel, and we are grateful for his direct involvement in bringing back our hostages,' he added. 'Secretary Rubio’s engagements with senior officials will promote U.S. interests in advancing regional cooperation, stability and peace,' State Department Spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a press statement ahead of the visit. 'The trip will center on freeing American and all other hostages from Hamas captivity, advancing to Phase II of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, and countering the destabilizing activities of the Iranian regime and its proxies,' the statement continued. Rubio’s trip follows Trump’s proposal to relocate Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip, after which the coastal area would be turned over to American control for reconstruction. On Thursday, Rubio said in an interview that any plan allowing Hamas to rule Gaza would be unacceptable to Israel and ineffective in resolving the conflict. He added that Trump was willing to take the lead on rebuilding Gaza, as no other viable plans have been proposed. Rubio‘s trip also comes amid Israel’s ceasefire agreement with the Hamas terrorist group and the release of hostages held in the Strip. The truce is 'tenuous' because Hamas is a terrorist organization responsible for violence against civilians, Rubio told journalist Chris Cuomo by phone on NewsNation on Tuesday. The secretary of state on Monday described Hamas as an 'evil' and 'monstrous' organization that must be wiped out. 'This is an evil organization. Hamas is evil. It’s pure evil. These are monsters. These are savages. That’s a group that needs to be eradicated,' he said during an interview on talk radio channel SiriusXM Patriot. Rubio will also travel to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over the next three days.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News US President Donald Trump's plan for the US to take control of Gaza and allow its civilians to leave the area during the rebuilding process is 'absolutely legal,' according to international human rights lawyer Arsen Ostrovsky. In fact, Ostrovsky asserts that those violating international human rights law are the ones insisting that Gazan civilians must remain in Gaza. Speaking to ILTV News, he said, 'Einstein's famous quote is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. And for many, many years, including since October 7, the international community has had the same failing strategy with respect to Gaza, a strategy that essentially allows Hamas to remain in power, which we know is simply unacceptable.' Ostrovsky emphasized that Trump's plan would be legal as long as the transfer of civilians was not done by force, which would violate international law. Instead, Ostrovsky says he understands Trump's proposal as creating 'a set of circumstances and conditions to allow Gazans to voluntarily choose to move to better conditions elsewhere.' He added that those who insist that Gazans must stay in the Gaza Strip are, in fact, advocating for an inhumane and unsustainable situation. 'I would actually go one step further and suggest that those who insist the Gazans stay are perhaps the ones violating international law. By doing so, especially while Hamas remains in power, they're essentially forcing Gazans to stay in an active war zone and allowing them to be used as human shields by Hamas,' Ostrovsky said. During a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Donald Trump unveiled his plan for the US to control Gaza and for the civilian population to relocate to Arab countries. Although the plan was welcomed by Israelis, heads of Arab nations have rejected it. The proposal involves collaborating with Arab states to accept refugees from Gaza while the area is reconstructed, a process that could take up to ten years.

IDF soldiers report that Hamas is planting explosives in the Gaza...	This report follows news from last week that Nukhba terrorists were driving pickup trucks near the buffer zone. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News IDF soldiers stationed in the security zone around Gaza report observing Hamas infrastructure crews working in the area and planting explosives. Israeli journalist Almog Boker interviewed soldiers who said terrorists are taking advantage of their access to the zone to lay explosives intended for Israelis. Upon hearing the report, Defense Minister Israel Katz said, 'The directive to the IDF is clear and unambiguous: Anyone who enters the Gaza buffer zone, whether on foot or in a vehicle, is putting their life at risk – and the IDF must respond accordingly.' 'We have a duty to protect IDF soldiers and the residents of southern Israel from every threat and danger, and we will not compromise on security. We will not return to the pre-October 7th reality,' he continued. This report follows news from last week that Nukhba terrorists were driving pickup trucks near the buffer zone, but the IDF's Southern Command refrained from shooting at them. The decision not to strike was based on the fact that the vehicles were merely approaching the zone, not inside it. In this case, the presence of terrorist vehicles outside the zone did not violate the ceasefire. Israel’s air force conducted an airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip on Sunday morning, despite an ongoing ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas terrorist organization in the coastal enclave. The strike was in response to what appeared to be an immediate threat posed by a group of armed Hamas terrorists spotted approaching an IDF position near the Philadelphi Corridor in southern Gaza, which separates the Gaza Strip from Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula. 'An Israel Air Force aircraft struck a group of armed men earlier today as they moved toward an IDF force in the southern Gaza Strip,' the IDF said Sunday morning. 'Several hits were identified.' The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry claimed that three people were killed in the strike, with two others injured. The Palestinian Authority mouthpiece, WAFA, reported the increase in the death toll from two to three.

IDF airstrike during ceasefire kills 3 Hamas terrorists	Israeli Air Force bombs group of armed Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip as they approached an IDF army unit, leaving at least three terrorists dead, two injured. By World Israel News Staff Israel's air force carried out an airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip Sunday morning, despite an ongoing ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas terror organization in the coastal enclave. The strike was conducted in response to what was potentially an immediate threat posed by a group of armed Hamas terrorists spotted approaching an IDF position close to the Philadelphi Corridor in southern Gaza which separates the Gaza Strip from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. 'An Israel Air Force aircraft struck a group of armed men earlier today as they moved towards an IDF force in the southern Gaza Strip,' the IDF said Sunday morning. 'Several hits were identified.' The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry claimed that three people were killed in the strike, with two more injured, the Palestinian Authority mouthpiece WAFA reported, raising the death toll from two to three. Arabic media outlets in the Gaza Strip claimed that the three men killed were Hamas-affiliated police officers working to secure the flow of humanitarian aid from the Rafah crossing into Gaza. Later on Sunday, an IDF spokesperson announced that the Israeli military had foiled an attempt to smuggle weapons across the Egyptian border. During the incident, the IDF detected a drone aircraft which violated Israeli airspace, crossing over from Egypt in the Paran district. 'The drone aircraft was downed by an IDF force which arrived at the site and located the drone, which was carrying a gun and ammunition,' the IDF spokesperson said. 'The confiscated combat equipment were transferred to security forces for handling.'

Marco Rubio lands in Israel, meets with Netanyahu	US Secretary of State makes his first trip to Israel since taking office, meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as joint efforts to secure second phase of hostage deal continue. By World Israel News Staff United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio landed in Israel late Saturday night, kicking off his first visit to the Jewish state since he took office less than a month ago. Hours after touching down at Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv, Rubio met privately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem. Afterwards, the two leaders held a joint press conference, during which Netanyahu lauded Rubio as a 'champion' of Israel-U.S. relations. 'President Trump is the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House,' Netanyahu said. 'Your visit here reflects it in every way. Throughout your career you have been a great friend of Israel and a champion of the U.S.-Israel alliance. I have no doubt that your unwavering support will continue during your tenure as secretary of state.' Netanyahu also cited the Trump administration's 'unequivocal support' for Israel's policies in Gaza 'moving forward,' alluding to President Donald Trump's call to resettle the coastal enclave's population in third-party countries, and Trump's backing of Israel's right to resume fighting with Hamas forces in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli premier said that he and Rubio discussed, among other things 'Trump's bold vision for Gaza,' the situation in Syria following last year's coup which saw the ouster of President Bashar Assad, and the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants for Netanyahu and a former Israeli defense chief. 'I am absolutely confident that under President Trump's leadership, together with you, Secretary Rubio, the best days of our alliance are still yet to come.' Secretary of State Rubio reiterated the Trump administration's demand that Hamas release all remaining hostages immediately. 'The hostages need to come home,' said Rubio. 'That must happen. It is not optional.' Rubio also lauded Trump's Gaza plan as a 'bold' alternative to the 'tired ideas of the past.' 'The president has also been very bold in his view of what the future should be for the Gaza Strip. Not the same tired ideas of the past; something bold that, frankly, took courage.'

New DNA research could lead to personalized cancer prevention for...	Using advanced genomic tools, the team discovered that DNA’s environment plays a crucial role in determining how much damage occurs and how well cells can repair it. By Pesach Benson, TPS New research about how smoking damages DNA could open new possibilities for targeted cancer prevention. Israeli and US researchers found that the way DNA is organized and chemically modified influences how cigarette smoke affects it. In a study recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, Nucleic Acids Research, the scientists found that some areas of DNA are more open and active, making them more vulnerable to damage but also more efficient at repairing themselves. Other regions are less capable of repair, allowing mutations to develop and potentially lead to cancer. The researchers from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, led by Prof. Sheera Adar and graduate student Elisheva Heilbrun-Katz — collaborated with Prof. Raluca Gordan from Duke University and the University of Massachusetts — also provides new insights into how smoking-related lung cancer develops. Globally, tobacco use is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. In 2019, it was responsible for approximately 2.6 million cancer deaths, accounting for about 25% of all cancer fatalities worldwide, according to the American Cancer Society. Around 8,000 Israelis die from illnesses caused by active or passive smoking, including various cancers, heart attacks, strokes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, according to figures released by the Israeli Health Ministry in January. To examine how DNA structure and chemical modifications affect damage from cigarette smoke and the body’s ability to repair it, the researchers focused on benzo[a]pyrene, a harmful chemical found in cigarette smoke. When processed by the body, it turns into Benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE), a substance that binds to DNA and interferes with its normal function. Using advanced genomic tools, the team discovered that DNA’s environment plays a crucial role in determining how much damage occurs and how well cells can repair it. Open and active regions of DNA experience more damage but are also repaired more efficiently. Transcription factors, proteins that regulate gene activity, can either protect DNA from damage or increase its vulnerability. The study also found that the efficiency of DNA repair is a key factor in whether mutations form, regardless of how much damage initially occurs. The research suggests that the body’s ability to fix DNA damage is more important than the extent of the damage itself in determining cancer risk. Understanding that some DNA regions are more vulnerable to smoking-induced mutations could help identify high-risk individuals based on genetic and epigenetic factors. This could lead to personalized smoking cessation programs or targeted monitoring for early cancer detection. Moreover, if certain transcription factors influence DNA repair efficiency, drugs could be developed to enhance repair in vulnerable regions, potentially reducing the mutation burden and slowing cancer progression. The findings could help identify specific genetic or epigenetic markers that indicate a higher risk of lung cancer, allowing for earlier and more precise screening methods. And in the long-term, modifying DNA repair mechanisms through gene therapy or epigenetic drugs might help protect high-risk individuals from accumulating smoking-related mutations.

Israeli soldiers arrest 20 men crossing into Lebanon to visit Tal...	The police stressed that illegally crossing the Lebanese border is punishable by up to four years in prison. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli soldiers arrested a group of around 20 Orthodox men who illegally crossed into Lebanese territory to reach the grave of a prominent Talmudic rabbi that straddles the border, the Israeli Police said on Sunday. According to the police, the Israel Defense Forces arrested the Haredim after they crossed the border. They were trying to reach the grave of Rav Ashi, a key figure in the compilation and writing of the Babylonian Talmud. Rav Ashi, who died around 427 CE, headed the Sura Academy in Babylonia, in what is now southern Iraq. He is credited with beginning the process of editing and organizing the discussions of previous generations of sages, which ultimately became the Babylonian Talmud. His work, continued after his death by later scholars laid the foundation for Jewish law as it is known today. Rav Ashi was laid to rest in the Upper Galilee near the present site of Kibbutz Manara, though some scholars believe his grave is in Iraq. A shrine marking the burial spot is located inside a compound located between IDF and UNIFIL positions. The police stressed that illegally crossing the Lebanese border is punishable by up to four years in prison. In November, 71-year-old Israeli civilian researcher Zeev Erlich was killed along with Sgt. Gur Kehati in a Hezbollah ambush after illegally entering Lebanon hoping to find the burial site of Simon the Zealot, a lesser-known disciple of Jesus. Erlich had entered Lebanon wearing an army uniform, though he was neither on active or reserve duty. Two other soldiers were injured in the ambush. Under the terms of a two-month ceasefire that went into effect on November 27 and has since been extended, Hezbollah is supposed to withdraw its armed presence from areas of southern Lebanon south of the Litani River. Israeli forces have withdrawn from most of southern Lebanon. Dissatisfied with the Lebanese army’s deployment, Israel is keeping soldiers in five locations with US approval. The 'Blue Line' demarcating the 120 km-long Israeli-Lebanese border was created in 2000 by UN cartographers to verify Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon, which the UN Security Council later certified as complete. The border runs from Rosh HaNikra on the Mediterranean coast to Mount Dov, where the Israeli-Lebanese border converges with Syria.

Israel frees 369 Palestinian terrorists as part of hostage deal	The distribution plan indicated that 334 prisoners were to be taken to Gaza, 24 faced deportation abroad, reportedly to Egypt, 10 were to be transferred to Judea and Samaria and one was to be sent to eastern Jerusalem. By JNS Israel released 369 Palestinian terrorists on Saturday in exchange for three Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The prisoners were freed wearing sweatshirts featuring a Star of David and the phrase 'Never forgive, never forget' in Arabic. Some discarded and burned the clothing.

With two weeks left in the first phase of the truce, a total of 21 hostages and over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners have been released so far. According to the Palestinian Prisoners’ Club, 333 of the released prisoners were from Gaza and were detained after Oct. 7, 2023. The distribution plan indicated that 334 prisoners were to be taken to Gaza, 24 faced deportation abroad, reportedly to Egypt, 10 were to be transferred to Judea and Samaria and one was to be sent to eastern Jerusalem. Thirty-six prisoners serving life sentences were among those released. Among them was Ahmed Barghouti, a close aide of Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti. Ahmed Barghouti was serving 13 life sentences for attacks that killed 12 Israelis during the Second Intifada [2000-2005], including the devastating bombing at Tel Aviv’s Seafood Market restaurant. The release roster also includes Mansour Sharim, a prominent figure in the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades in Tulkarem. Serving 14 life sentences, Sharim orchestrated numerous attacks against Israelis during the Second Intifada. His conviction encompasses intentional causing of death and attempted murder charges. According to Israeli Justice Ministry records, he too was facing deportation. Another significant release involves Mansour Mokdeh, a Fatah member imprisoned since 2002. Serving a 30-year sentence for weapons possession and murder, Mokdeh was slated for permanent deportation. Palestinian media sources also indicated the imminent release of Shadi Abu Shahadam, who played a key role in planning and executing the 2002 Mahane Yehuda suicide bombing that claimed six Israeli lives. The attack was carried out by a woman from Hebron. Abu Shahadam, currently serving a life sentence, was facing permanent deportation. His conviction includes multiple charges: making threats, intentional causing of death, membership in an unauthorized organization, attempted murder and conspiracy to commit a crime. He has remained in custody since 2002. The hostages freed in this exchange were American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, Argentine-Israeli Iair Horn, 46, and Russian-Israeli Alexander Troufanov, 29. Under the first six-week phase of the ceasefire agreement, a total of 33 hostages and 1,900 prisoners are set to be released.

Torture, lice-ridden tunnels, salty water – freed hostages speak ...	Sagui Dekel-Chen, Alexandre (Sasha) Troufanov and Iair Horn suffered unspeakable conditions in Hamas captivity. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Sagui Dekel-Chen, Alexandre (Sasha) Troufanov and Iair Horn, the three hostages freed Saturday, have begun revealing the unspeakable conditions in which they were held during 498 days of Hamas captivity, Channel 12 and Kan News reported Sunday. The trio, who were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz, were held almost the entire time in tunnels under Khan Yunis, only a few miles away from their point of capture. The underground passages were moldy and infested with lice and bedbugs. The hostages were also given practically no food and only salty water to drink, which only increased their thirst. Hamas suspected some of the men of being IDF soldiers, although all three men were over army age. American-Israeli Dekel-Chen (36) underwent frequent interrogations to reveal intelligence that he did not have, and the results of the torture have left scars on his body, Channel 12 reported. He was also shot in his right shoulder when Hamas forces overran Nir Oz and he went to fight the terrorists while leaving his pregnant wife and two young daughters inside their home’s safe room. Dekel-Chen reported that he was completely cut off from all means of communication over these 16 months and lived with the constant thought that his family had been murdered in the kibbutz. He was only informed that they were alive just before his release, including the fact that his wife had given birth to a third daughter some two months after his capture. Russian-Israeli Alexandre (Sasha) Troufanov, 29, was shot in both legs and brutally beaten when captured by the terrorists. Unlike the others, he was held alone his entire time in captivity, and learned to read and write Arabic as a means to keep busy. He was only updated irregularly by his captors as to what was happening in the war but did hear on the radio that his mother and girlfriend, who had been captured along with him but whom he never saw, had been freed in the first deal with Hamas in November 2023. Troufanov’s and Dekel-Chen’s wounds were left untreated the whole time in captivity, and it is likely that they will have to undergo surgery to repair their injuries. Horn (46) lost several dozen kilograms during his time in captivity and did not receive regular medical treatment. He had been kidnapped along with his brother, Eitan (37), who had come to the kibbutz for the Simchat Torah holiday that was being celebrated on October 7. The brothers were at first held together but then were separated, and Horn does not know Eitan’s current condition. The three hostages were exchanged for 369 Palestinian security prisoners, including 36 senior terrorists serving life sentences. While the deal’s parameters were that 30 terrorists would be released for every male civilian, Israel also promised to release 1,000 Palestinians who were detained since the October 7 Hamas-led invasion and did not participate in the day’s massacre of 1,200 people. Some of this cohort are seemingly being freed every week, which is why the number of freed prisoners is so high.

Amazon finally speaks out on employee held hostage in Gaza	For 16 months, the retail giant kept quiet about the Israeli hostage because it said it didn’t want to endanger him. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Amazon headquarters has finally spoken out after its employee, Alexandre (Sasha) Troufanov, was released Saturday as part of the first phase of the Israel-Hamas hostage and ceasefire deal. CEO Andy Jassy wrote an email to the international retail giant’s entire workforce, saying, 'I’m incredibly relieved to share the news that our AWS teammate, Sasha Troufanov, who had been held hostage since the October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel, has been released from captivity.' Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides cloud computing services to its clients, and Troufanov worked for the Annapurna Labs subsidiary in Israel that designed a new chip for the company. When the company held a conference that featured the chip during the week in November 2023 that Israel and Hamas had their first hostage deal, in which Troufanov’s mother, grandmother and girlfriend were released, among others, friends of the captive paid to have trucks with screens bearing Troufanov’s face drive around outside the Las Vegas hall. Amazon itself did not comment on the kidnapping, nor did it condemn Hamas, angering many Jewish employees in various countries, who said that for the first few months they did not even know that their colleague was among those forcibly taken into Gaza. Only the company's Israeli employees were allowed to show Troufanov's picture on their walls and speak about their colleague. In Saturday’s message, Jassy insisted that Amazon had 'had a dedicated team working behind the scenes with experts to support efforts to secure [the Troufanovs’] release and to ensure that we did the right thing for them and their safety.' This included, he added, 'painfully not commenting publicly for fear that we would negatively impact their ability to be released or how they were treated in captivity.' The CEO thanked 'all who tirelessly advocated' for Troufanov’s safe return. One of these was a close friend of the Russian-Israeli engineer, Neta Yesood Alon, who angrily told Globes in May that the company 'had explained to activists and the family that any public activity in Amazon’s name was liable to put Troufanov at risk, and that they didn’t want to turn Sasha into the poster child of the hostages, because that would raise his value.' When Globes contacted Amazon for a comment, it vaguely stated that 'We continue to focus all the time on all the efforts to bring Sasha back home safely,' and said it was 'support[ing] the family at this difficult time.' In the email, Jassy repeated that his company 'will continue to support them and do everything we can to help them heal' now that Troufanov was free. He ended with a general message that his 'heart goes out to everyone impacted by the war' and that he hoped for peace, while still not condemning the terrorists who were the cause of his employee’s horrific ordeal.

IAF kills Hezbollah drone force commander	During the war, Hezbollah’s aerial forces, known as Unit 127, repeatedly fired explosives-laden drones into Israel. By JNS An Israeli Air Force strike in Southern Lebanon on Saturday night killed Hezbollah operative Abbas Ahmad Hamoud, who was responsible for overseeing the Iranian-backed terror group’s aerial force. Hamoud was targeted after repeatedly violating the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire, including by launching UAVs toward Israeli territory, according to the Israel Defense Forces. 'The IDF continues to operate to remove any threat to the State of Israel and will operate to prevent any attempt by the Hezbollah terrorist organization to establish itself, which is contrary to the understandings reached between Israel and Lebanon,' added the statement. During the war, Hezbollah’s aerial forces, known as Unit 127, repeatedly fired explosives-laden drones into Israel. Overnight Thursday, IAF fighter jets attacked Hezbollah targets in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley after the Iranian-backed terrorist organization dispatched a surveillance drone over the Jewish state. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz on Saturday described the launch of the drones at the Jewish state as 'a red line' and 'a blatant violation' of the ceasefire agreement. 'As I warned, if there are drones, there will be no Hezbollah,' said Katz. Also on Thursday, the IAF carried out targeted strikes on Hezbollah military sites in Southern Lebanon that posed a direct threat to Israel’s security, the IDF said. 'Terrorist activity in these sites is a clear violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon,' the military added. The IDF’s 769th 'Hiram' Brigade, operating under the 91st 'Galilee' Division, is continuing to conduct searches in Southern Lebanon as part of operations aligned with the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon, the army stated on Thursday. Troops have discovered weapons depots containing missiles, rockets, mortar shells, grenades, explosives and firearms. In forested areas, they also found concealed multi-barrel launchers aimed at Israeli territory. Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri announced on Thursday that Beirut rejects Israel’s plan to maintain a presence in five locations in Southern Lebanon after the ceasefire’s Feb. 18 expiration date. According to Berri, the United States, acting as a mediator, informed him that Israel would withdraw from certain villages but intended to remain in five strategic points. Berri, an ally of Hezbollah, stated that he had conveyed Lebanon’s complete rejection of this proposal on behalf of Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam. Under the ceasefire agreement, Israeli forces are to gradually withdraw from Southern Lebanon as the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) assume responsibility for ensuring Hezbollah remains disarmed south of the Litani River. However, there has been growing concern in Jerusalem regarding the LAF’s ability to effectively curb Hezbollah’s presence. In response, the IDF continues frequent border operations to prevent the group from regaining strength, including intelligence gathering, reconnaissance and clearing terrain to disrupt terrorist movements. The ceasefire, which took effect on Nov. 27, mandated an Israeli withdrawal within 60 days. However, the U.S.-monitored arrangement between Lebanon and Israel is set to continue until Feb. 18, according to a White House statement on Jan. 26.

Lebanon: 25 UNIFIL attackers arrested, will be punished	The incident raised serious questions as to whether Lebanese security forces are capable of reigning in Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff Lebanese security forces have arrested 25 people who participated in a recent attack on UN peacekeeping forces, according to an official statement. Last Friday, Hezbollah activists waving the terror group's flags attacked a convoy of UNIFIL soldiers near Beirut International Airport. Footage of the attack circulating on social media showed mobs beating UNIFIL soldiers and setting one of their vehicles on fire. Two UN soldiers were wounded in the attack, including Nepalese national Chok Bahadur Dhaka, who is the outgoing deputy force commander of UNIFIL. Dhaka's injuries were serious enough that he required hospitalization. 'More than 25 people have been arrested by Lebanese army intelligence,' Lebanese Interior Minister Ahmad al-Hajjar told reporters during a media conference on Saturday. However, al-Hajjar noted, 'this does not mean these detainees carried out the attack… but the investigations will show who is responsible.' Lebanese President Joseph Aoun pledged in a statement posted to his X account that 'the attackers will receive their punishment.' Aoun added that 'security forces will not be lenient with any party that tries to upset stability and civil peace.' The chaos began with a protest by pro-Hezbollah activists, who were demonstrating against a decision by Lebanese authorities to disallow an Iranian plane from landing. The denial to land occurred after an Israeli warning that Iran was using the airport to smuggle cash to Hezbollah, which would make the transportation hub a potential target for the IDF. Hezbollah activists raged that Lebanon was caving to Israeli and international pressure, and they blocked roads near the airport as an act of protest. UNIFIL was called in to deescalate the situation, but instead, came under attack by Hezbollah activists. The incident raised serious questions as to whether Lebanese security forces are capable of reigning in Hezbollah and its activists. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the violence in a press statement. 'Such attacks are absolutely unacceptable… The safety and security of UN personnel and property must be respected at all times,' Stephane Dujarric, Guterres’s spokesman, said in a media release. 'Attacks against peacekeepers are in breach of international law… and may constitute war crimes,' the statement added. 'UNIFIL must be allowed unrestricted freedom of movement throughout Lebanon.'

After Trump lifts ban, US heavy bombs arrive in Israel	Shipment of MK-84 heavy aerial munitions arrive in Israel over the weekend, after being held up for nearly a year by the Biden administration. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News After close to a year of delays, a shipment of heavy aerial bombs from the United States arrived in Israel over the weekend. Israel's Ministry of Defense announced Sunday morning that a shipment of heavy aerial bombs recently released by the U.S. government was received and unloaded late Saturday night. A shipping vessel carrying an order of 2,000-pound MK-84 munitions docked Saturday night and was unloaded at the Port of Ashdod before dawn Sunday morning. The munitions were loaded onto dozens of trucks from the Transportation Unit of the Ministry’s Logistics and Assets Department and the IDF's Technological and Logistics Directorate and transferred to Israeli Air Force bases. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (Likud) said that the arrival of the heavy bombs serves as 'evidence' of the strong ties between Israel and the U.S. Katz also called the aerial munitions a 'significant asset' for the Israeli military. 'The munitions shipment that arrived in Israel tonight, released by the Trump Administration, represents a significant asset for the Air Force and the IDF and serves as further evidence of the strong alliance between Israel and the United States.' 'In our recent conversation, Secretary of Defense, HON Pete Hegseth reaffirmed America's commitment to continue providing Israel with all necessary tools to ensure its security.' 'I thank President Donald Trump and the U.S. Administration for their unwavering support of the State of Israel. We will continue working together to strengthen our security.'​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ The shipment of MK-84 heavy bombs was held up for nearly a year, after the Biden administration suspended the transfer of some aerial munitions to Israel, amid criticism of the IDF's handling of the war in the Gaza Strip and in protest of Israel's plans in early 2024 to carry out a large-scale ground operation in Rafah. Shortly after taking office, President Donald Trump lifted the Biden-era ban, clearing the way for the shipment of MK-84 bombs to be transferred to Israel.

Russian Ambassador meets newly-freed hostage Sasha Trufanov	The Kremlin does not classify Hamas or Islamic Jihad - the group which held Trufanov - as terror organizations. By World Israel News Staff Russian Ambassador to Israel Anatoly Viktorov met with former Islamic Jihad hostage Alexander 'Sasha' Trufanov just hours after his release from captivity, presenting him with a new Russian passport on Saturday. The ambassador 'sincerely welcomed the release of our compatriot,' the Russian Embassy in Israel wrote on its official X account, alongside images of Viktorov meeting with Trufanov at Sheba Hospital. 'Russian diplomats did not stop their efforts to free Alexander Trufanov for a single day,' the embassy added. 'They were in constant contact with the Israeli and all interested parties in the region on this priority issue for us.' The statement noted that advocacy efforts for Trufanov's release were performed 'on the instruction of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin.' Notably, the Kremlin does not classify Hamas or Islamic Jihad - the group which held Trufanov - as terror organizations. Viktorov gave a new Russian passport to Trufanov, which he had previously applied for but 'for obvious reasons, was unable to receive on time.' Trufanov was kidnapped along with his mother, Yelena, grandmother, Irena, and girlfriend Sapir Cohen from his parent's home in Kibbutz Nahal Oz on October 7th. His father, Vitaly, was murdered by terrorists during the attack. Trufanov's mother and grandmother were released in a November 2023 agreement between the Kremlin and the terror group, which did not require concessions from Russia towards Hamas. Cohen, his girlfriend, was released in an Israeli hostage deal that saw the majority of Israeli female and child captives freed from Gaza. In recent months, Moscow raised concerns around Trufanov's physical health, as he was shot twice during his abduction and was never provided with proper medical care. A Russian government spokesman celebrating Trufanov's release failed to mention that Israel had freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners as part of the deal. 'We thank the Hamas administration for its decision,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News As a form of psychological torture, Hamas terrorists informed Sagui Dekel-Chen about the birth of his daughter, gave him earrings, and instructed him to give them to his wife. Dekel-Chen did not believe the terrorists about the birth of his daughter until the IDF confirmed it was true. He had been injured in the shoulder but told the soldiers to disregard his wounds, saying, 'What’s most important is meeting my family.' Sagui Dekel-Chen, Yair Horn, and Sasha Troufanov were released together on Saturday after 498 days in captivity. Horn and Dekel-Chen were held together, while Troufanov was kept in isolation during his captivity. The three were held captive in Khan Younis, just a few hundred meters from where they were abducted at Kibbutz Nahal Oz on October 7th. Initially, they were confined in tunnels before being moved to apartments. Horn knew that his brother had also been taken hostage, and shortly after his capture, he asked, 'When will they release Eitan?' When the IDF informed Troufanov that his father, Vitaly, had been murdered, he broke down in tears. Although Dekel-Chen, Horn, and Troufanov showed signs of severe weight loss and were weak and pale, they could stand and walk independently. They appeared healthier than the three hostages released the previous week, whose emaciated appearances were compared to Holocaust survivors. Upon their release, the hostages were given small amounts of food, including tea with sugar, applesauce, a few biscuits, and vitamin B1 (thiamine) to prevent refeeding syndrome—a potentially fatal condition that can occur when food is reintroduced too quickly to the body of someone severely malnourished. The hostages had appeared in videos created by Hamas for propaganda purposes and psychological warfare against Israelis. Horn was coerced into mentioning his brother Eitan in one of these videos. Regarding the release of Troufanov, a Russian citizen, Russian press secretary Dmitry Peskov said, 'Moscow praises the release of Alexander Troufanov in Palestine.' Peskov also thanked Hamas for agreeing to release him.

Hamas agrees to relinquish control of Gaza in second phase of hos...	Hamas said it would be prepared to discuss the implementation of Phase Two of the hostage and ceasefire agreement on Monday. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Hamas has reportedly agreed to step down from governing Gaza during the second phase of the ceasefire and hostage exchange agreement. On Thursday, senior official Osama Hamdan told Qatar-based Al Araby TV that Hamas would be prepared to discuss the implementation of Phase Two of the agreement on Monday. Hamdan said the terror group would abide by the agreement; 'If Israel meets its commitments, we will proceed with releasing the hostages as agreed on Saturday or in the coming days.' As part of Phase Two, Hamas agreed it would step away from governing Gaza. The ceasefire agreement seemed to have been at an impasse last Monday when Hamas said it would not return hostages as agreed on Saturday, citing allegations that Israel had violated the agreement. Hamas claimed that Israel was blocking aid and preventing civilians from returning to their homes in northern Gaza. 'Over the past three weeks, the resistance leadership has been observing the enemy's violations and their failure to uphold the terms of the agreement,' Hamas stated. 'The return of displaced people to the northern Gaza Strip is being delayed, while they are being targeted with shelling and gunfire in various parts of Gaza. Additionally, relief supplies of all kinds are being blocked from entering as agreed, even though the resistance has fulfilled all its commitments.' Last Sunday, footage published on social media showed Gazans approaching the border with Israel, violating the ceasefire agreement that requires a 700-meter buffer zone. The video shows Gazan civilians near Kibbutz Nahal Oz, prompting the IDF to fire shots into the crowd. Gazan media reported that three people were killed in the shooting. The IDF stated that it fired warning shots in multiple areas of Gaza. Defense Minister Israel Katz commented on the incident on Sunday night, saying, 'Israel’s security stance on Gaza remains firm: Anyone entering the buffer zone does so at their own risk.' 'There will be no tolerance for those who pose a threat to IDF forces, the border region, or nearby communities. We will not allow a repeat of the events of October 7. 'IDF troops acted appropriately today in identifying and neutralizing the threat, and this approach will continue. The IDF is fully prepared for any scenario and will respond decisively to any danger,' Katz stated. The IDF has cautioned Palestinians against approaching the Israeli border and the buffer zone within Gaza, where its troops are stationed.

369 Palestinian prisoners freed, forced to wear sweatshirts with ...	Of the 369 Palestinian prisoners released Saturday, 36 were serving life sentences for murder. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The 369 Palestinian prisoners released in exchange for three hostages on Saturday were made to wear sweatshirts with a Star of David on the back, alongside the phrase 'We will not forget nor forgive' in Arabic. These prisoners were freed in exchange for Sagui Dekel Chen, Alexander Sasha Troufanov, and Iair Horn, who had been held in Gaza for 498 days. Of the 369 Palestinian prisoners, 36 were serving life sentences for murder. One source criticized Israel's prison service (IPS) to KAN News for making the decision to have the prisoners wear the sweatshirts, pointing out that the political echelon had not been informed, and the action projected a negative image at a time when Israel is condemning Hamas's cynical tactics to cause embarrassment and psychological harm to hostages, such as releasing them with medals, ceremonies, and 'goody bags.' The IPS clarified that the decision was made by IPS Commissioner Kobi Yaakovi, according to KAN. Hamas condemned the shirts, calling the slogans written on them 'racist' and referring to the treatment of prisoners as a violation of humanitarian law, in contrast to the resistance's strong commitment to moral values in the treatment of the enemy's prisoners. Among the prisoners released on Saturday was Ahmed Barghouti, cousin and aide to intifada terrorist Marwan Barghouti, who was directly involved in attacks that killed 12 Israelis. Another released prisoner was Fatah terrorist Mazen al-Qadi, who planned a 2002 attack on a seafood restaurant in Tel Aviv that killed three Israelis. Qadi was also suspected of sexually assaulting five female guards at Ramon Prison in 2023. Mantzur Sharim, serving 14 life sentences plus an additional 50 years, was also released. During the Second Intifada, he attacked a banquet hall in Hadera, killing six Israelis and injuring 26. Sharim also murdered a soldier and a civilian in 2001.

3 released hostages appeared emaciated, pale	Alexander 'Sasha' Troufanov, Sagui Dekel Chen, and Iair Horn, appeared emaciated and pale as they returned to Israel after 498 days in captivity. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The three hostages, Alexander 'Sasha' Troufanov, Sagui Dekel Chen, and Iair Horn, appeared emaciated and pale as they returned to Israel after 498 days in captivity. However, the three were able to stand and walk unaided, and medical professionals determined they did not require hospitalization at either Soroka Medical Center or Barzilai Medical Center in the South. In addition to being checked by medical staff in Re'im, they were accompanied by mental health officers on their way to both Ichilov Hospital and Sheba Medical Center. The freed hostages were given small amounts of food, including tea with sugar, applesauce, a few biscuits, and vitamin B1 (thiamine) to prevent refeeding syndrome, a potentially fatal condition that can occur when food is introduced too suddenly into the system of someone who is severely malnourished. The three were reunited with their families, underwent medical tests, and were transported by Yasur helicopter for further treatment. Medical professionals are concerned that, in addition to the psychological trauma endured by the former hostages, their near-starvation conditions might have caused permanent damage to their hearts and muscles. The families of the hostages expressed joy and relief at the return of their loved ones. The Troufanov family said in a statement: 'We are filled with overwhelming emotion and gratitude as Sasha returns home after 498 long and agonizing days in captivity. On October 7, he was brutally abducted from his home and shot in both legs. Seeing him today is a powerful source of strength, offering us renewed hope for the challenging rehabilitation ahead. This moment brings immense relief to us, his friends, and to everyone who never gave up hope and prayed for his safe return.'

By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon Iran paraded a cache of highly advanced ballistic missiles across Tehran following a series of threats by President Donald Trump to 'bomb the hell' out of the country if it doesn’t roll back its atomic weapons program. As the hardline regime worked to prove its military might, a senior Iranian militaIran unveiled two types of ballistic missiles, the Khorramshahr and Hajj Qassem, as well as a satellite carrier dubbed the 'Omid.'ry commander dared Trump to strike, saying he 'does not have the courage to attack Iran.' The charged rhetoric signals that Tehran is choosing confrontation with the United States after Trump reimposed his 'maximum pressure' sanctions campaign on the country, which specifically aims to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program and deny it intercontinental ballistic missiles—the same ones used to attack Israel twice last year. At the same time, Trump has expressed a willingness to pursue diplomacy with Iran, saying he favors that approach over conflict. But the military demonstrations across Tehran this week, held to celebrate the 46th anniversary of the regime’s 'Islamic revolution,' indicate the president is facing an uphill battle. 'Trump does not have the courage to attack Iran,' General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Aerospace Force, said on the sidelines of Monday’s military display. 'Iran, as a powerful nation, does not bow to coercion.' Iran unveiled two types of ballistic missiles, the Khorramshahr and Hajj Qassem, as well as a satellite carrier dubbed the 'Omid.' The towering ballistic missiles can travel around 1,800 to 2,000 kilometers, putting them well within reach of not only Israel but U.S. military outposts across the region. The Khorramshahr 'can carry multiple warheads,' while the Hajj Qassem is a 'precision strike missile' that can penetrate enemy air defense systems, much like those Israel used last year to fend off a swarm of Iranian missiles, according to the Iran’s state-controlled media. Other missiles in Tehran’s arsenal are nuclear-capable and based on North Korean technology. Iran emphasized that it can now build much of this equipment on its own, without help from allies like Russia and China. For regional observers, Tehran’s military posturing is part of a bid to restore its image in the wake of Israel’s devastating October strike on the country’s air defense systems and key military installations. 'These highly public shows of force are how the regime hopes to repair its battered deterrence after Israel’s successful military pushback against it in 2024,' said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a nonproliferation expert who analyzes Iran’s weapons program for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. As part of this image rehabilitation, Tehran ran additional air defense drills this week and revealed a 'new solid-propellant medium range ballistic missile,' according to Ben Taleblu, who said he expects Iran to continue testing Trump in the coming months. 'While Trump’s new presidential memorandum will be a bright green light to enforce maximum pressure sanctions which long atrophied under Biden, Iran in the short term will continue to ramp up its nuclear capable missile threat,' he said. During a Wednesday public appearance, Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei praised the country’s military establishment for making advances on ballistic missiles and other weapons technology. 'Iran's defense power is known to everyone today,' he said. 'While the friends of the revolution are proud of it and the enemies are afraid of it.' Khamenei’s remarks came after he toured a military facility producing a series of new 'kamikaze' drones, which appear similar to those used by Hezbollah during its siege on Israel’s northern border. Amid this flurry of military activity, Iranian diplomats on Tuesday filed a formal complaint with the United Nations Security Council over Trump’s repeated threats to bomb the country if a diplomatic deal cannot be reached. 'I would like a deal done with Iran on non-nuclear,' Trump told the New York Post on Saturday. 'I would prefer that to bombing the hell out of it.' The president made similar remarks a day later on Fox News. Iran’s ambassador to the U.N., Amir Saeid Iravani, complained that Trump’s 'reckless and inflammatory statements flagrantly violate international and the U.N. charter.' 'The Islamic Republic of Iran firmly rejects and condemns this reckless threat,' Iravani said before the international body. 'The U.N. Security Council must not remain silent in the face of such brazen rhetoric, as normalizing the threat to use force sets a dangerous precedent and must be unequivocally condemned.'

As Kennedy takes over the Department of Health and Human Services, he faces significant challenges, including shaping vaccine policy, managing Medicare and Medicaid, and preparing for future public health crises. By Jewish Breaking News Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been confirmed as Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) in a 52-48 Senate vote, overcoming strong opposition from both Democrats and some Republicans. His confirmation follows a dramatic political evolution, from being a staunch Trump critic to becoming a key figure in the administration. Kennedy, a longtime environmental lawyer and vaccine skeptic, once harshly criticized President Donald Trump, even comparing him to Adolf Hitler. However, during the 2024 election, Kennedy initially launched a Democratic presidential bid before switching to an independent campaign. As his poll numbers declined and financial struggles mounted, he suspended his campaign in August 2024 and endorsed Trump, citing alignment on key issues such as government health mandates and regulatory overreach. Robert Kennedy walks out during a Trump rally. (Twitter Screenshot) Trump rewarded Kennedy’s endorsement by nominating him for HHS Secretary in November 2024, a move that stunned both parties. While conservatives saw it as an unconventional choice, Kennedy’s history of opposing vaccine mandates and public health restrictions resonated with many in Trump’s base. Kennedy’s confirmation process was fiercely contested. Democrats unanimously opposed him due to his decades-long promotion of vaccine conspiracy theories, while some Republicans were wary of his past support for abortion rights and environmental regulations. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor and staunch vaccine advocate, was the only Republican to vote against Kennedy. Leading up to the vote, Senate Democrats staged an all-night protest, warning that Kennedy’s appointment could undermine public health initiatives. However, despite their efforts, Kennedy secured the necessary votes on Thursday morning. As Kennedy takes over the Department of Health and Human Services, he faces significant challenges, including shaping vaccine policy, managing Medicare and Medicaid, and preparing for future public health crises. His critics worry that his leadership could erode trust in scientific institutions, while his supporters argue he will bring much-needed reform to federal health agencies. Kennedy’s appointment marks a major shift in the Trump administration’s approach to public health, setting the stage for contentious policy battles in the months ahead. Whether he moderates his stance or doubles down on his past positions remains to be seen. The post Robert F.

Trump will support ‘any decision Israel makes’ about Hamas, notin...	Trump had warned that the 'gates of hell' could be unleashed on Gaza if Hamas did not release all the hostages by the 12:00 deadline. By World Israel News and JNS Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed gratitude to US President Donald Trump for his leadership and strong stance, which contributed to the hostages' release on Saturday morning, according to a statement issued on Saturday night. 'The combination of the reinforcement of IDF forces around the Gaza Strip and President Trump's firm stance led to the release of three of our hostages today - despite Hamas's earlier refusal to release them,' the statement read. 'The Prime Minister also appreciates the President's full support for Israel's decisions regarding the Gaza Strip going forward.' The U.S. president congratulated the freed hostages, but made clear that their release fell short of his call to free all the captives. 'Hamas has just released three Hostages from GAZA, including an American Citizen. They seem to be in good shape! This differs from their statement last week that they would not release any Hostages,' Trump said on Saturday on his social media platform Truth Social. 'Israel will now have to decide what they will do about the 12:00 O’CLOCK, TODAY, DEADLINE imposed on the release of ALL HOSTAGES. The United States will back the decision they make!' he added, seemingly referring to U.S. Eastern Time, which is 7 p.m. in Israel. The president’s deadline was a reference to his previous warning that the 'gates of hell' could be unleashed on Gaza if Hamas did not release all the hostages. Seventy-three hostages remain inside the Strip, including 70 kidnapped on Oct. 7. Saturday’s exchange of hostages for terrorists was the sixth such round under Phase 1 of the ceasefire that took effect on Jan. 19 and is to end on March 1. The three latest returnees from Hamas captivity in Gaza reunited on Saturday with their families in heartfelt scenes of elation and relief. American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, met with his wife, Avital, and his parents at the IDF’s Re’im camp just outside the Strip before being flown by helicopter to Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer in Ramat Gan. שגיא דקל-חן במפגש הראשון המרגש עם אשתו אביטל והוריו נעומית ויונתן, בנקודת הקליטה הראשונית בישראל. צילומים: דובר צה'ל pic.twitter.com/OWSVIQZeuF &mdash; ראש ממשלת ישראל (@IsraeliPM_heb) February 15, 2025 During the reunion, Avital informed him of their third daughter’s name. She was seven-months’ pregnant when Dekel-Chen was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023. 'Do you remember what you called her? That’s her name, Shahar-Mazal,' she said. 'Perfect,' Dekel-Chen replied. 'You are heroes, you protected me,' Dekel-Chen told his spouse and mother. Embracing his wife in the helicopter, he held a sign addressed to his three daughters that read, 'Daddy is on his way.' שגיא דקל-חן עם בני משפחתו, במסוק בדרכם לבית החולים. שגיא כתב: 'ברי, גלי, שחר - תודה ששמרתן עליי, אבא בדרך' צילומים: דובר צה'ל pic.twitter.com/Vu2PMqwYRM &mdash; ראש ממשלת ישראל (@IsraeliPM_heb) February 15, 2025 The Dekel-Chen family released a statement to the press, saying, 'Our Sagie is home. A friend, a son, a partner, and most of all—a father. And now, he has returned. For almost 500 days, he was so far away, and now, at last, he is on Israeli soil, with us. In the coming hours, he will begin the recovery process, reunite with his daughters, Gali and Bar, and meet his youngest daughter, Shachar, for the first time—she was born while he was in captivity. 'Our hearts ache for all that he missed, but now he is here, unlike so many others,' the statement read. 'There are still many families waiting for their loved ones, many children waiting for their fathers. We will continue to fight until the last hostage is brought home. This is our duty.'

Seeing him today strengthens us and gives us great hope for the long recovery process ahead of him,' his family said in a statement. אלכסנדר (סשה) טרופנוב במפגש הראשון והמרגש עם אמו ילנה ובת זוגו ספיר כהן, בנקודת הקליטה הראשונית בישראל. צילומים: דובר צה'ל pic.twitter.com/4oQJVbyKBg &mdash; ראש ממשלת ישראל (@IsraeliPM_heb) February 15, 2025 Troufanov made aliyah with his family when he was three years old.

'Sasha was abducted along with his mother, grandmother and girlfriend in the October 7, 2023, attacks, during which his father was killed. His mother, grandmother and girlfriend were released in November 2023.

The Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement that Israel is 'fully prepared for the next steps in every respect,' referring to the fragile truce with Hamas and its potential collapse. The PMO welcomed the three men 'with a warm embrace. We have prepared for their return, and together with their families, we will assist in their recovery after the long and harrowing days in captivity.' The statement continued that Hamas again 'attempted to violate the agreement and fabricate a crisis with false claims. Thanks to the concentration of our forces inside and around Gaza, and due to President [Donald] Trump’s clear and unequivocal statement, Hamas backed down, and the hostage releases continued.

Wedding of peace’: Children of Russian and Ukrainian rabbis marry...	At the wedding, Minister of Housing and Construction of the Israeli government, Zeev Elkin, who migrated to Israel from Ukraine in 1990, said a prayer for the return of all the Israeli hostages held in Gaza. By TPS Rivka Lazar, daughter of the Chief Rabbi of Russia Berl Lazar, and Sholom Wolf, son of the Chief Rabbi of Odessa and Southern Ukraine Avraham Wolf, got married yesterday in Jerusalem. Three thousand guests attended the ceremony, where the couple stood beneath the chuppah (traditional Jewish wedding canopy). The wedding host announced that this was going to be 'the chuppah of the piece.' 'The Chassidic world has always transgressed boundaries,' one of the guests of the ceremony who asked not to be identified told TPS-IL. 'It is not really so important that Russia and Ukraine are at war. Jews still remain friends and relatives, and that is how it always has been.' When the marriage was announced last November at the annual Congress of Chabad Ambassadors in New York, the popular joke was that US President Donald Trump had done the ‘shidduch’ (the matchmaking process in Hebrew). At the wedding, Minister of Housing and Construction of the Israeli government, Zeev Elkin, who migrated to Israel from Ukraine in 1990, said a prayer for the return of all the Israeli hostages held in Gaza. The guests were offered a souvenir gift from the wedding – a collection of articles by the late Lubavitcher Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the spiritual leader of the Chabad movement. Berl Lazar has never condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Unlike leaders of other confessions in Russia, including Russian Patriarch Kirill or the Grand Mufti of Russia, Rawil Ğaynetdin, he has not supported it, either.

Azerbaijan becomes first Muslim-majority country to include antis...	The study did not find signs of Islamism or radicalism, instead noting a focus on a secular and inclusive national identity. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner Azerbaijan has become the first Muslim-majority country to include a definition of antisemitism in its textbooks, according to a new report assessing the Azerbaijani educational system. The Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education (IMPACT-se), a nonprofit organization that analyzes schoolbooks and curricula around the world, examined 53 textbooks from Azerbaijan’s national curriculum, identifying significant improvements, such as the removal of anti-Israel narratives and the absence of Islamist rhetoric. As part of a series on Central Asian curricula produced in collaboration with the Ruderman Family Foundation, IMPACT-se is also examining the educational systems of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. The new report released on Thursday not only highlights the inclusion of positive portrayals of Jews and Israel in Azerbaijan’s textbooks but also notes that these textbooks acknowledge the Holocaust as a mass genocide in which six million Jews were murdered. According to the London-based NGO, Azerbaijan’s national curriculum promotes ideals of diversity and tolerance, and offers a balanced view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The study did not find signs of Islamism or radicalism, instead noting a focus on a secular and inclusive national identity. 'Azerbaijan promotes the freedom of religion and tolerance, creating an open environment for all religions to flourish, including Judaism,' the study concluded. 'Students are taught the value of tolerance and harmony in modern society, and examples of Jewish prayer and rituals are incorporated into the curriculum.' The report highlighted 'promising progress and developments' in the revisions made for the 2024-25 school year, with Judaism being 'highly regarded in the textbooks' and some Biblical narratives included in the education system. For example, one key aspect was the inclusion of a definition of antisemitism, making Azerbaijan the first Muslim-majority country to do so and, according to the report, reflecting its commitment to promoting tolerance and fighting racism. In line with these goals, the country’s national curriculum also correctly portrays the Holocaust as a genocide of six million Jews, highlighting antisemitic measures such as arbitrary killings and imprisonment rather than trying to downplay or deny the Nazis’ atrocities. 'Antisemitism and the Holocaust are addressed within the framework of rejecting racism and totalitarian regimes,' the study said. The report also found that these textbooks explain the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in a more balanced way, attributing its origins to Arab rejection of the 1947 UN Partition Plan and using terms like 'taken over' or 'captured' instead of 'occupied' when referring to territories under Israeli control. New revisions removed references to Zionism as racist and reclassified Palestinian violence, once called 'guerrilla warfare,' as terrorism, acknowledging its negative global impact. Additionally, geography textbooks now recognize Israel as a Jewish state. Despite these advancements, IMPACT-se highlighted the lack of Azerbaijani Jewish history and broader Jewish historical narratives, pointing to this as an area for further improvement. However, the findings in 'Israel and Jews in Azerbaijani Education,' the title of the Impact-se report, are the latest signs of the friendly relations between the two countries. Israel is presented as an ally, with references to shared military expertise, and derogatory references to domestic and international policy have been tempered. 'The textbooks demonstrate a clear rejection of the extreme Islamist values promoted by their near-neighbor Iran,' IMPACT–se CEO Marcus Sheff said in a statement. 'Instead, they promote tolerance, diversity, and a heartfelt respect for Jews and Israel, which serves as an important model for many other majority-Muslim states.' Azerbaijan’s ties with Israel have long been significant, with the country serving as the Jewish state’s most vital ally in the Caucasus and Central Asia for more than three decades, fostering a partnership that spans energy security, defense, and intelligence. Last week, Israel and Azerbaijan’s state oil company, SOCAR, struck a major energy deal, marking one of the latest examples of Azerbaijan’s emerging role as a strategic player in the Middle East.

Hostages Alexandre Troufanov, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Yair Horn free...	Since the ceasefire entered into force on Jan. 19, 19 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been released in exchange for 566 Palestinian terrorists held in Israeli prisons. By JNS Three Israeli men regained their freedom on Saturday, after 498 days of captivity in the Gaza Strip. The hostages were handed over to representatives of the Red Cross at a staged event in Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip, shortly after 10 a.m., and to the IDF and the Israeli Security Agency (Shin Bet) at approximately 10:30, and were being escorted to Israeli territory for an initial medical examination. Alexandre ('Sasha') Troufanov, 29, who has dual Russian citizenship, had been held by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist organization, while American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, and Argentinian-Israeli Yair Horn, 46, were captives of Hamas. In return, Israel is to release 369 terrorists later on Saturday—36 serving life sentences, most of who will go to the Gaza Strip or Egypt, and 333 terrorism suspects apprehended inside the Gaza Strip since the Hamas-led invasion of the northwestern Negev on Oct. 7, 2023, according to figures from the Palestinian Authority Prisoners Ministry. All three hostages were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz. Troufanov was abducted along with his mother, Yelena Trufanov; his grandmother Irena Tati; and his girlfriend, Sapir Cohen. His mother and grandmother were freed by Hamas on Nov. 29, 2023, at the request of Russian President Vladimir Putin, while Cohen was released as part of a ceasefire deal that same month. Troufanov’s father, Vitaly, was killed during the Oct. 7 massacre. Sagui Dekel-Chen was also taken from Nir Oz during the terrorist invasion. His mother, Neomit, was taken captive along with neighbors in an electric cart that was headed toward Gaza when an Israeli Air Force helicopter shot at the terrorists and driver. Neomit was wounded and escaped. Dekel-Chen’s third daughter, Shachar, was born two months later. Yair Horn’s brother Eitan, 38, who was visiting from Kfar Saba, was also kidnapped and is still in the Gaza Strip. Since the ceasefire entered into force on Jan. 19, 19 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been released in exchange for 566 Palestinian terrorists held in Israeli prisons. The latter figure is to rise to 935 later on Saturday. During the first six weeks of the ceasefire, a total of 33 hostages are set to be freed in exchange for approximately 1,900 Palestinian terrorists held in Israel. Hamas says eight on the list of 33 captives have died inside the Gaza Strip. Saturday’s exchange of hostages for terrorists was the sixth such round under Phase 1 of the ceasefire that took effect on Jan. 19 and is to end on March 1. Talks are ongoing on Phase 2 and 3. The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Gazan terrorists killed around 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. Seventy-three hostages remain inside the Strip, including 70 kidnapped on Oct. 7.

The Hamas official confirmed to Reuters that Dekel-Chen was among those set to be released from captivity. Separately, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist group said that it would free Russian-Israeli Troufanov as part of the arrangement. Israel has stated it will resume combat in Gaza if three hostages are not freed on time, after Hamas announced it was delaying the releases in response to alleged Israeli ceasefire violations. Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump called for the ceasefire to be abandoned if Hamas did not release all hostages held in Gaza by noon Saturday. Since the ceasefire began on Jan. 19, 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been released in exchange for 566 Palestinian terrorists held in Israeli prisons. This will be the sixth round of hostage releases. During the first six weeks of the ceasefire, a total of 33 hostages are set to be freed in exchange for approximately 1,900 Palestinian terrorists held in Israel. Hamas says eight on the list are dead. The war began with the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, when gunmen killed around 1,200 people and took 251 hostages.

Hamas calls for ‘solidarity marches’ worldwide to protest Trump G...	Trump has suggested that the current population of Gaza would be moved to one large site or various locations. By JNS Hamas called for 'solidarity marches' on Friday, Saturday and Sunday to protest against U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to remove the Gazan population from the Strip in order to rebuild it. 'We … call on the masses of our people, our Arab and Islamic nation, and the free people of the world to go out in massive solidarity marches' to denounce 'the plans to displace our Palestinian people from their land,' the terrorist group said in a statement on Wednesday. Trump said that the United States will 'take over' Gaza, speaking during a press conference at the White House alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Feb. 4. Initially, Trump said Palestinians could return to Gaza, but he reversed himself on Feb. 10, telling Fox News host Bret Baier that Palestinians who leave the Gaza Strip would not return under his plan 'because they’re gonna have much better housing' elsewhere. Trump has suggested that the current population of Gaza would be moved to one large site or various locations. In an unverified report, Israel’s Channel 12 claimed that three areas being considered are Morocco, Somaliland, and Puntland, a region in northeast Somalia that declared itself an autonomous state in 1998. Netanyahu expressed support for the plan and a poll found that most Israeli Jews did so as well. Meanwhile, the ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel struck on Jan. 19 appears to be disintegrating. Mediators Egypt and Qatar are attempting to resuscitate it as a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo for talks, the BBC reported on Thursday. Netanyahu said on Tuesday that unless Hamas returns all Israeli hostages by noon on Saturday, Feb. 15, the ceasefire will expire and the Israel Defense Forces will resume fighting until it totally defeats Hamas. Netanyahu’s ultimatum followed an 'in-depth, four-hour discussion' by the Cabinet. 'We all expressed outrage at the shocking state of our three hostages who were freed last Saturday. We all also welcomed President Trump’s demand for the release of our hostages by noon on Saturday,' the prime minister wrote. Netanyahu has ordered the IDF to amass forces in and around the Gaza Strip 'in light of Hamas’s statement about its decision to violate the [ceasefire] agreement,' Netanyahu said, referring to Hamas’s announcement that it would delay the release of hostages until further notice. The statement by Netanyahu announcing the ultimatum followed remarks by Trump on Feb. 10, who suggested Saturday noon as a deadline after which 'all hell will break loose' unless Hamas frees all hostages.

South Africa says ‘no chance’ it will withdraw genocide case agai...	Trump also accused South Africa in his executive order of working with Iran 'to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.' By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner South Africa has vowed to continue pursuing its case against Israel at Trump also accused South Africa in his executive order of working with Iran 'to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.'the United Nations’ top court accusing the Jewish state of committing genocide in Gaza, saying it will not change course despite strong US opposition. There is 'no chance' of South Africa withdrawing its case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague, Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola told the Financial Times in a new interview. 'Standing by our principles sometimes has consequences, but we remain firm that this is important for the worldLamola, and the rule of law,' he added. The comments from South Africa’s top diplomat came after US President Donald Trump last week signed an executive order to 'halt foreign aid or assistance' to South Africa partly in response to the country’s ICJ case and anti-Israel stance. Trump’s order was also a response to South Africa’s new land expropriation law, which the US argues discriminates against Afrikaners, a minority South African ethnic group of European descent. During the interview, Lamola denied such accusations, stating that the White House’s statements were 'misinformation.' He also argued that the land reform is not 'arbitrary,' but an essential measure to rectify the land ownership inequalities left by apartheid. Trump also accused South Africa in his executive order of working with Iran 'to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.' 'While we do have a good relationship with Iran, we don’t have any nuclear programs with them, nor any trade to speak of,' Lamola said. US intelligence agencies have for years described Iran as the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism, and Iranian leaders routinely declare their intention of destroying Israel. Trump’s executive order puts at risk not only $440 million in aid to South Africa but also tariff-free access to US markets under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, presenting a major challenge for the South African coalition government, which took power last year after the ruling African National Congress (ANC) lost its majority in parliament for the first time in South Africa’s post-apartheid democratic history. The ANC still remained the largest party and retained power at the national level through a coalition. 'We are willing to engage with them to persuade them, if they are willing to be persuaded,' Lamola said. Since December 2023, South Africa has been pursuing its case at the ICJ accusing Israel of committing 'state-led genocide' in its defensive war against the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas in Gaza. Israeli leaders have condemned the case as an 'obscene exploitation' of the Genocide Convention, noting that the Jewish state is targeting terrorists who use civilians as human shields in its military campaign. Meanwhile, South Africa’s Jewish community have lambasted the case as 'grandstanding' rather than actual concern for those killed in the Middle Eastern conflict. Last year, the ICJ ruled there was 'plausibility' to South Africa’s claims that Palestinians had a right to be protected from genocide. However, the top UN court did not make a determination on the merits of South Africa’s allegations, which may take years to go through the judicial process, nor did it call for Israel to halt its military campaign. Instead, the ICJ issued a more general directive that Israel must make sure it prevents acts of genocide. The ruling also called for the release of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the terrorist group’s invasion of and massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Last month, Cuba officially became the latest country to join South Africa’s genocide case against Israel, following Ireland, Nicaragua, Colombia, Mexico, Libya, Bolivia, Turkey, the Maldives, Chile, Spain, and 'Palestine.' Since the Hamas atrocities of Oct. 7, the South African government has been one of the fiercest critics of Israel’s military campaign, which seeks to free the hostages kidnapped by the terrorists and dismantle Hamas’s military and administrative control in Gaza. In late 2023, South Africa temporarily withdrew its diplomats from Israel and shut down its embassy in Tel Aviv, saying the government was 'extremely concerned at the continued killing of children and innocent civilians' in Gaza. Then in December of that year, South Africa hosted two Hamas officials who attended a government-sponsored conference in solidarity with the Palestinians. One of the officials had been sanctioned by the US government for his role with the terrorist organization. Months later, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa led the crowd at an election rally in a chant of 'From the river to the sea, Palestine shall be free' — a popular slogan among anti-Israel activists that has been widely interpreted as a genocidal call for the destruction of the Jewish state, which is located between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.

Iran to build 1,000 nuclear sites if ‘enemy’ destroys 100, presid...	Pezeshkian also criticized the United States for pursuing a 'contradictory' approach to Iran, saying that while President Donald Trump claims he wants to negotiate a nuclear deal, he also imposes harsh sanctions on Tehran. By Ailin Vilches Arguello, The Algemeiner Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Thursday warned that if 'enemies' attack Iran’s nuclear facilities, the country will quickly rebuild and multiply them, seemingly responding to new reports of a possible Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites by the middle of this year. '[Enemies] threaten us that they will hit our nuclear facilities … If you strike a hundred of those, we will build a thousand other ones,' Pezeshkian said during a speech in the southern province of Bushehr, according to Iranian state media. 'You can target the buildings and locations, but you cannot target those who build them,' he said, adding that Iranian 'experts' will continue to expand the country’s nuclear program. Pezeshkian’s comments came after a Washington Post report claimed that Israel may launch a preemptive strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities in Fordow and Natanz by mid-year, citing US intelligence assessments. Such an operation could exploit extensive damage done to Iran’s military capabilities in October, when Israel devastated Iranian air defense systems and ballistic missile production facilities in a coordinated, three-wave strike. The attack was a response to Iran targeting the Israeli homeland with 181 ballistic missiles weeks earlier. During his meeting in Bushehr, Pezeshkian criticized the United States for pursuing a 'contradictory' approach to Iran, saying that while President Donald Trump claims he wants to negotiate a nuclear deal, he also imposes harsh sanctions on Tehran. 'The enemy wants us to be humiliated before them with sanctions and threats, but we will not be subjugated and we will solve our problems by relying on our people,' Pezeshkian said. 'We will run the country by relying on our domestic capabilities.' Last week, Trump signed a presidential memorandum restoring his 'maximum pressure' campaign on Iran that includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero in order to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. However, Trump has also denied that the US and Israel are planning to carry out a military strike on Iran, saying he instead wants to reach a 'nuclear peace agreement' with Tehran. In response to Trump’s comments, Iran’s so-called 'supreme leader,' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the idea of negotiating with Washington, calling the idea 'unwise' and 'dishonorable' days later. In an interview with Fox News, Trump also mentioned the possibility of Israel striking Iran, emphasizing that he would rather reach an agreement with Tehran to stop it from obtaining nuclear weapons. 'Everyone thinks Israel, with our help or our approval, will go in and bomb the hell out of them. I would prefer that not to happen,' Trump said. Amid increasing tensions, the commander of Iran’s conventional air force, Hamid Vahedi, also threatened to retaliate against any attack on Tehran. 'We tell all countries, friends and foes alike, that our country’s doctrine is defensive, but we will respond with force against any enemy attack,' he said. The US, Israel, and other allied countries fear that Iran’s nuclear program is ultimately designed to produce nuclear bombs. Iran has claimed that its nuclear program is for civilian purposes rather than building weapons. However, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), reported in December that Iran had greatly accelerated uranium enrichment to up to 60 percent purity, close to the roughly 90 percent weapons-grade level, at its Fordow site dug into a mountain. The UK, France, and Germany said in a statement at the time that there is no 'credible civilian justification' for Iran’s recent nuclear activity, arguing it 'gives Iran the capability to rapidly produce sufficient fissile material for multiple nuclear weapons.' According to US intelligence reports detailed in The Wall Street Journal, US officials believe that an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities would only delay Tehran’s program for a few weeks or months, yet Israeli officials believe it would have a significant impact. Israel is reportedly considering two potential strike options, both of which would require US support for aerial refueling, intelligence gathering, and surveillance. Of these two options, one is reported to involve Israeli fighter jets launching ballistic missiles from the air without entering Iranian territory, while the other would see aircraft deploying bunker-busting bombs over Iranian nuclear sites. The Trump administration recently approved the sale of training kits for this type of strike. In November, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Iran was 'more vulnerable than ever to attacks on its nuclear facilities.' 'We have the opportunity to achieve our most important goal – to thwart and eliminate the existential threat to the State of Israel,' he said in a post on X. In my first meeting today with the @IDF General Staff Forum, I emphasized: Iran is more exposed than ever to strikes on its nuclear facilities.

ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan officially sanctioned by Trump admin, b...	The ICC responded to Trump with a forceful condemnation, stressing that the court produces 'independent and impartial' work. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner The United States has imposed sanctions on International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Karim Khan in accordance with an executive order signed by President Donald Trump, the US Treasury Department confirmed on Thursday. Khan was sanctioned by the US after spearheading the ICC’s issuing arrest warrants for Israeli leaders over their role in the ongoing war against the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas in Gaza. The White House announced on Monday that Khan would be the first member of the ICC to be issued personal sanctions, and both the White House and Treasury Department noted on Thursday that he has been added to the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. Khan’s assets in the United States are now frozen, and he is banned from entering the country. The announcement came on the heels of Trump’s executive order last week to punish members of the ICC for targeting Israel. Trump’s order lambasted the ICC for its 'illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel.' Trump stated that the ICC 'abused its power' to pursue an unsubstantiated and politically motivated criminal case against Israeli leaders. The ICC responded to Trump with a forceful condemnation, stressing that the court produces 'independent and impartial' work. 'The court stands firmly by its personnel and pledges to continue providing justice and hope to millions of innocent victims of atrocities across the world,' the ICC said. Trump signed the executive order after Senate Democrats blocked legislation to sanction the ICC in January. The bill ultimately failed by a vote of 54-45, with Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) being the sole Democrat to vote in favor of punishing the ICC. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (NY) criticized the bill as 'poorly drafted and deeply problematic.' The House had passed the legislation. In November, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, and now-deceased Hamas terror leader Ibrahim al-Masri (better known as Mohammed Deif) for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict. The ICC said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant were criminally responsible for starvation in Gaza and the persecution of Palestinians — charges vehemently denied by Israel, which has provided significant humanitarian aid into the war-torn enclave throughout the war. US and Israeli officials issued blistering condemnations of the ICC move, decrying the court for drawing a moral equivalence between Israel’s democratically elected leaders and the heads of Hamas, the Palestinian terrorist group that launched the ongoing war in Gaza with its massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The ICC has no jurisdiction over Israel as it is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the court. Other countries including the US have similarly not signed the ICC charter. However, the ICC has asserted jurisdiction by accepting 'Palestine' as a signatory in 2015, despite no such state being recognized under international law.

The visit included a tour, history and a wreath-laying ceremony next to a large metal sculpture of seven contorted bodies labeled '1933-1945,' the years the camp operated, per the pool. By Izzy Salant, JNS U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, met with Abba Naor, a Holocaust survivor, and with Karl Freller, the director of the Bavarian Memorial Foundation, and other officials at Dachau, the site of a former concentration camp in Germany, on Thursday. 'You look better than I do, and I’m 40,' Vance told Naor, per the pool report. The report noted that the two spoke, as it snowed lightly, in front of a gate with the sign 'Arbeit macht frei' and that most of the discussion was inaudible to the pool. Vance’s visit follows Mike Pence’s and Joe Biden’s when they were vice president, per the Associated Press. (Kamala Harris did not appear to visit the site, per public reports.) A guide told the vice president and his wife that prisoners 'had to cede everything they had with them' and showed the two 'a display filled with the effects of a prisoner from Czechoslovakia,' per the pool. Vance 'asked the guide: ‘Do we know what happened to him after the war?’ The guide says he survived but that he wasn’t exactly sure about the details,' it added. 'Mrs. Vance asked if there were any special provisions for survivors after the war. The guide replied that people who returned to Communist countries behind the Iron Curtain weren’t always treated well and that their loyalties were questioned.' Naor showed Vance a card with his prisoner information and said, 'I’m still here,' per the pool. 'Well, we’re very lucky you’re here,' Vance said, putting his hand on Naor’s shoulder. The visit included a tour, history and a wreath-laying ceremony next to a large metal sculpture of seven contorted bodies labeled '1933-1945,' the years the camp operated, per the pool. Vance laid a wreath with a red, white and blue ribbon stenciled with 'We remember' and 'United States of America' in gold lettering, per the AP. Inside the camp, the delegation was shown the intake area of the concentration camp, which also featured a large map of the Nazi concentration camp network per the pool. 'I’ve read a lot about the Holocaust in books, but being here and seeing it up close in person really drives home what unspeakable evil was committed, and why we should be committed to ensuring that it never happens again,' Vance said, per the AP. 'Moving visit to Dachau Memorial underscoring U.S. commitment to Holocaust remembrance and commemorating the 80th anniversary of the camp’s liberation by U.S. forces on April 29, 1945,' stated the U.S. embassy in Berlin. The embassy added that Vance and his wife 'were touched by meeting Abba Noar, one of the last remaining Holocaust survivors.' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was also scheduled to be in Germany on Thursday to take part in the Munich Security Conference and the G7 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, per the U.S. State Department. Rubio is also slated to travel to Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, from Feb. 15 to 18, per the State Department. 'Secretary Rubio’s engagements with senior officials will promote U.S. interests in advancing regional cooperation, stability and peace,' Foggy Bottom added.

Trump announces Israel-India trade route running through Israel	Trump: 'It will run from India to Israel to Italy and onward to the U.S., connecting our partners, roads, railways, and undersea cables.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News During a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, U.S. President Donald Trump declared that a new trade route between the two countries—passing through Israel—will be 'the greatest in history.' 'It will run from India to Israel to Italy and onward to the U.S., connecting our partners, roads, railways, and undersea cables,' Trump said while meeting Modi at the White House. Trump acknowledged that the trade route would be 'costly,' but emphasized that it is crucial for the countries to 'stay advanced and remain the leader.' The President also expressed confidence that the friendship between Israel and India is 'the strongest it has ever been.' He added that they would discuss the long-standing trade disparities between the two countries and expected 'wonderful trade deals' in the future. 'We’ll begin negotiations to address the long-standing disparities that should have been resolved over the past four years,' stated the U.S. President. Additionally, Trump announced that the U.S. would begin selling fighter jets to India. 'Starting this year, we’ll significantly increase military sales to India by billions of dollars. We're also paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 stealth fighters,' Trump said. Minister of Economy and Industry, Nir Barkat, traveled to India with Israel's largest business delegation on Monday. The two-day visit is aimed at strengthening economic relations between Israel and India, expanding trade opportunities, and fostering technological collaboration. The delegation's departure marks a new phase in the growing economic partnership between the two nations. 'The departure of this economic delegation to India represents a critical step in enhancing our ties, boosting Israel’s economy through increased exports, and lowering living costs by expanding imports,' said Barkat. 'At the invitation of Indian Economy Minister Piyush Goyal, we are embarking on a mission to unlock new markets, boost trade, and eliminate barriers.'

US Sec of State Rubio invites Arab States that don’t like Trump G...	All these countries claim to care about Palestinians, but none of them are willing to take any in. None have a history of doing anything for Gaza,' Rubio said. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News U.S. Senator Marco Rubio invited Arab nations to propose a post-war plan for Gaza, especially if they are critical of U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to relocate Gaza's civilian population. Arab nations have expressed disapproval of Trump’s plan, which calls for the U.S. to take control and rebuild Gaza, while relocating its civilian population to neighboring countries. After meeting with President Trump, King Abdullah of Jordan agreed to take in 2,000 sick Gazan children, though he opposed relocating the broader Gaza population. Rubio made these remarks before departing on a trip to the Middle East, where he is set to meet with leaders from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Israel. He stated that the purpose of the trip was to explore potential solutions to the Gaza conflict and its aftermath. Speaking on the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton radio show, Rubio said, 'Hopefully they’ll have a strong plan to present to the president,' referring to Arab nations. 'The only plan right now — which they don’t like — is the Trump plan. So, if they have a better plan, now is the time to present it.' In response to Trump's relocation proposal, Arab officials emphasized their solidarity with the Palestinian people. Rubio argued that if these nations truly care for Palestinians, they should offer a viable solution for post-war Gaza. 'All these countries claim to care about Palestinians, but none of them are willing to take any in. None have a history of doing anything for Gaza,' Rubio added. Rubio also acknowledged that many Arab states are acting in good faith to find solutions, but he emphasized that the future of Gaza cannot include Hamas as a political or military power. 'If the countries in the region can’t address that issue, then Israel will have to step in, and we’ll end up back where we’ve been,' he said. On Tuesday, Egyptian officials announced they were preparing a 'comprehensive proposal' for Gaza that would not involve relocating its civilian population.

And Siblani has gone far beyond simple criticism of the Jewish state. Siblani has for years defended and praised Hamas and Hezbollah, the Iran-backed terrorist groups. At a rally in Dearborn he organized on Sept. 25, Siblani hailed then-Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah as a 'hero.' 'They want us to be afraid of praising our leaders and martyrs, but today we say to them that our martyrs are heroes and our leaders are great, especially the great Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah,' Siblani said of the Hezbollah leader who was assassinated in an Israeli airstrike days later. After chants of 'death to Israel' broke out during Siblani’s speech, Siblani responded, 'Believe me, they will take care of the job,' an apparent reference to Hezbollah, according to the Middle East Media Research Institute. And he issued a message to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Jews: 'We will take you back to Poland.' In 2022, Siblani urged Arabs to 'fight within [their] means' against Israel, whether with 'stones,' 'guns,' or 'their hands.' He has bragged that he refused to condemn Hamas during a conference call with Biden White House officials in 2021. Siblani’s rhetoric should be no secret to Whitmer, who will leave office next year. The Anti-Defamation League and other Jewish groups have condemned Siblani’s remarks over the years and blasted the White House and Biden campaign last year for sending officials to meet with Siblani in Dearborn in hopes of gaining his political support. Whitmer may like to stay in Siblani’s good graces, given his influence within Michigan’s large Arab and Muslim community and her apparent presidential ambitions. Siblani has published Arab American News, the largest Arab-language newspaper in the country, since 1984 and frequently hosts rallies and other events in Dearborn, one of the nation’s largest Muslim-majority cities. Democrats consider Michigan part of their 'Blue Wall' path to winning the Electoral College, making the state’s Arab and Muslim vote key to victory. But Whitmer’s coziness with a terrorist sympathizer may not play well in other battleground states. Whitmer has catered to Siblani throughout her tenure. In 2022, she met with Siblani at his newspaper’s office after he publicly criticized her for visiting Israel. 'Governor Whitmer will hear from us soon on her wrong and offensive trip to Israel as its army brutally killing [sic] innocent Palestinians including children while carpet bombing Gaza,' Siblani said. He published photos after their one-on-one meeting and said Whitmer accepted his invitation to visit Arab countries. It’s unclear who paid for Siblani’s attendance on the trip. Whitmer’s other guests on the Middle Eastern trip include Maj. Gen. Paul D. Rogers, the adjutant general of the Michigan National Guard, and a variety of city and county officials from around Michigan. Several other attendees have been highly critical of Israel, including Wayne County executive Warren Evans and deputy county executive Assad Turfe. Last year, Evans and Turfe were spotted in the front row at anti-Semitic preacher Louis Farrakhan’s speech in Detroit, where the Nation of Islam leader claimed that the United States is 'enslaved' to Jews. Whitmer’s office did not respond to a request for comment. The post He said he'd take Jews 'back to Poland.' Gretchen Whitmer took him on an official state trip to the Middle East. appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/he-said-hed-take-jews-back-to-poland-gretchen-whitmer-took-him-on-an-official-state-trip-to-the-middle-east/	2025-02-14T02:22:02-08:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/whitmer.jpg
‘Students Against Nazi Extremism’ target Tesla cars in California...	In Europe, where Tesla has significant market presence, the response has been particularly fierce. By Jewish Breaking News California Tesla owners have become unwitting targets in the controversy still surrounding Elon Musk’s Nazi-like salute and his mounting influence in Washington. According to an investigative report by The Independent, a fringe group has been leaving notes on Tesla cars in the Bay Area with the words 'No Nazis in America,' with at least one tied to a brick. Calling themselves 'Students Against Nazi Extremism,' the group mailed a manifesto to local news outlet Lost Coast Outpost claiming responsibility for delivering threats to 13 Tesla owners across Arcata and Seaside. The three-page document denounced Musk as an 'overt Nazi with a history of fascist, racist, misogynist and criminal behavior' and outlined plans to vandalize Tesla vehicles in Rohnert Park and Hayward. Meanwhile, the anti-Tesla movement has now spread beyond California, with protesters gathering outside Tesla showrooms and charging stations in Manhattan and Maine, voicing their opposition to what they view as the billionaire overreach into federal government affairs. In Europe, where Tesla has significant market prIn Europe, where Tesla has significant market presence, the response has been particularly fierce.esence, the response has been particularly fierce. Outside Barcelona, French artist James Kina installed a provocative red raised arm at a Tesla charging station. In Germany, an image of Musk’s inauguration day Nazi-like salute was projected onto the exterior wall of a Tesla factory in Berlin, accompanied by the word 'heil.' Musk’s vocal support of the far-right AfD party has already sparked significant backlash from moderate and liberal Germans. For Tesla owners caught in the middle, their vehicles now carry an unintended symbol of fascism in a culture war they never asked to join.

80-year old freed hostage Gadi Moses describes walking 7km, solvi...	At some point, he realized he had to stop expecting immediate rescue and shift his focus to surviving each day. He taught himself to think differently.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Freed hostage, 80-year-old Gadi Moses, kept himself occupied during his captivity by walking seven kilometers a day in his tiny room and solving complex math problems in his head. Moses' nephew, Shai, said in an interview, 'At some point, he realized he had to stop expecting immediate rescue and shift his focus to surviving each day. He taught himself to think differently, to keep pushing forward, and to avoid the crushing disappointment of not being freed the next morning.' Moses had only learned of the murder of his long-term partner, Efrat Katz, 68, during his captivity and discovered that his daughter, Moran, had survived the Hamas invasion on October 7th when he was freed after 483 days. Although Moses was not held in tunnels like other hostages, he was confined in isolation in a tiny, dark, unsanitary room and given very little food. To comfort himself, Moses would have imaginary conversations with his loved ones. He hadn’t had any contact with another Israeli until he was escorted by Arbel Yehoud, 29, amid chaotic and hostile crowds in Gaza prior to their release. Moses talked to his captors and even negotiated access to a television, where he saw Israelis protesting for the release of hostages. This gave him strength and helped him understand that the nation was fighting for their return home. An agronomist and potato expert, Moses told his captors that, when the war ended and if peace were achieved, he would teach them how to farm. He also fearlessly debated the terrorists about the ownership of the land of Israel. The Hamas captors taunted him, asking, 'Where are your parents from? Go back there!' When they asserted that their ancestors lived in the land before the Jews, Moses responded, 'What are you talking about? Our people lived in these places 3,000 years ago!'

Lebanese government prevents Iranian plane with funds for Hezboll...	The Lebanese government is fulfilling a provision in the ceasefire agreement with Israel, which requires it to prevent Iran from transferring funds to Hezbollah. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The Lebanese government is preventing a plane scheduled to fly to Beirut from leaving Tehran's airport due to suspicions that it is being used to transfer funds to Hezbollah, according to reports from Arab media. By stopping the plane from flying to Beirut, the Lebanese government is fulfilling a provision in the ceasefire agreement with Israel, which requires it to prevent Iran from transferring funds to the Lebanese terror group. Passengers at Tehran's airport protested the fact that the plane was prevented from traveling on its scheduled route. Hezbollah supporters gathered outside the airport, waving flags associated with the terror group, protesting the decision by blocking the road and burning tires. IDF Arabic Language Spokesman Avichay Adraee revealed that Hezbollah and the Iranian Quds Force have been using international flights to receive funds from Iran. 'The IDF stays in communication with the ceasefire monitoring mechanism and regularly shares detailed information to disrupt these transfers. Despite these efforts, we believe that some of these money-smuggling attempts have been successful,' Adraee stated. He declared, 'The IDF will prevent Hezbollah from arming itself and will use all available means to enforce the ceasefire agreements, ensuring the security of Israel's citizens.' Iran is attempting to rebuild its weakened proxy group, Hezbollah, by flying millions of dollars to the terror organization through Beirut International Airport, a practice that the IDF has warned must stop immediately. The discovery of Iran transferring funds to terror groups through commercial flights comes just days before the deadline for Israel to withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon. A Trump administration official recently confirmed that Washington expects the IDF to leave the region by February 18. However, reports suggest that Israel is lobbying to extend that deadline. Displaced residents of northern Israel’s border region, who were evacuated from their homes shortly after the October 7, 2023, terror onslaught, have still been unable to return to their communities. The Israeli government set March 1st as the date by which displaced northerners are expected to return home, but that timeframe now appears unlikely.

Burned trees, traumatized animals: Nature is revealing the unseen...	Every winter, around 50,000 common cranes pause their migration to Africa to settle in the Hula Valley, but last year, relentless rocket fire from Lebanon—just 30 kilometers away—caused their numbers to plummet by 70%. By Deborah Danan, JTA The trees abutting the road leading to Biriya Forest, a nature preserve in northern Israel, at first resemble spruces turning autumnal shades of red, a sight reminiscent of landscapes in America or Europe but rare in Israel. A closer look, however, reveals that the trees are only charred remnants — the devastating result of rocket-induced wildfires that destroyed thousands of acres of forest while Israel battled Hezbollah in Lebanon. Fires break out every year in this forest, which like many others across Israel was planted by the Jewish National Fund, known today as KKL-JNF — but they are usually brought under control quickly. This year, with the local population evacuated and weather conditions unusually extreme, things played out differently. Starting around May, as temperatures rose, nearly every rocket fired from Lebanon was likely to ignite a fire. And it wasn’t just the rockets themselves: Israeli interceptors exploded overhead, scattering fragments that ignited at multiple points within the forest. The combination of unusual winds, scorching heat and low humidity created a perfect storm that has disrupted entire ecosystems, affected wildlife habitats and undone years of work by foresters aimed at increasing biodiversity. 'We literally witnessed their life’s work go up in smoke,' said Eli Hafuta, director of the Upper Galilee and Golan Region at KKL-JNF, which was founded in 1901 to cultivate Jewish-owned land in the region and today owns 13% of all land in Israel. 'It’s a devastating sight to watch trees that have stood for 70 or 80 years go up in flames,' Hafuta said. 'Even younger trees, ones my team and I planted just a decade ago, can be reduced to ashes in just 15 minutes.' The scorched earth in Biriya Forest reflects just one of many environmental effects of nearly a year and a half of war for Israel. Less visible than the lives lost, injuries sustained and homes destroyed has been devastation to flora and fauna in both Israel’s north and south. The cascading effects continued this week as the splashy kickoff for a new forest in the western Negev to honor war victims, timed to the Jewish environmental holiday of Tu Bishvat on Thursday, was canceled amid rising security threats in the region. A handful of Israeli officials are instead holding a smaller planting ceremony in the western Negev, at a site named for an officer killed on Oct. 7, 2023. Perhaps nowhere has the war’s effect on Israeli ecosystems been more pronounced than at the Agamon Hula Valley Nature Reserve, famed for its mesmerizing bird migrations. Twice a year, hundreds of millions of birds — including cranes, pelicans, and storks — pass through the valley, in a normal year turning it into a hotspot for ecotourism, with the BBC naming it one of the top 10 birdwatching sites in the world. During the months it was closed — from Oct. 7, 2023, until well after the ceasefire on Israel’s northern border took hold in late November — the Agamon Wildlife Rehabilitation Center on the reserve turned into what staff call the world’s first wartime field hospital for animals. 'We’re the first rehabilitation center in the world with a war protocol,' said Dr. Rona Nadler-Valency, the center’s head veterinarian and director. When rockets pounded the north, Nadler-Valency and her team were evacuated from their communities, forcing the center to operate remotely, with staff caring for injured animals at home when possible. After three months, the team began returning, resuming treatment at the center under a chaotic new normal. 'We would be in the middle of surgery, an animal on the operating table, when the sirens would go off,' Nadler-Valency said. 'We’d have to leave everything and run to the shelter — sometimes dozens of times a day.' At other times, Nadler-Valency and her team were caught outdoors when sirens sounded, forcing them to drop to the ground for cover. 'Those moments felt like pure insanity, but at least we were able to keep doing our work,' she said. With so few civilians remaining in the north, many of the wounded animals were brought to the center by soldiers. In one case, Lilit, a tawny owl brought in after being hit by a military vehicle, suffered a severe head injury that temporarily left her blind and deaf. Lilit was carefully monitored and rehabilitated in a specialized acclimation cage. Treatment was complicated by the ongoing missile fire, requiring the team to carefully time their visits to her, but eventually the team managed to restore her sight, hearing and flight. After a month and a half in the cage, Lilit was released back into the wild with a transmitter on her back, allowing the team to track her recovery and ensure she could hunt and survive, as well as gain insights into how owls adjust to life after similar injuries. 'Cases like Lilit’s,' Nadler-Valency reflected, 'were rays of light amid the madness.' The disruption fueled other changes that scientists are now tracking. Yaron Charka, chief ornithologist at KKL-JNF — which manages the reserve and its reopened visitors’ center — observed an increase in wintering bird species this year. 'I’m seeing a great variety of birds this winter, compared with last winter, where there were few,' he said, but acknowledged that he didn’t fully understand why. Every winter, some 50,000 common cranes settle in the Hula Valley, pausing their southward migration to Africa. But last year, that number dropped by 70% amid constant rocket fire from Lebanon, just 30 kilometers from the valley. Still, Charka cautioned against attributing all of the changes to the cross-border clashes. 'During wartime, birds can change their route and bypass us in isolated instances — we saw this with Ukraine — but it’s not the whole picture,' he said, noting that the ceasefire came at the end of the migratory season and emphasizing that climate change, which is having an outsized effect on Israel, is also causing changes in the cranes’ migration habits. 'In the past two years, the arrival of the crane flocks in the fall to the Hula Valley has been significantly delayed,' he said. 'It is important that we continue to monitor this trend.' The site’s extended closure left the cranes unaccustomed to humans, so camouflaged wagons now help visitors observe them closely while minimizing disturbance. With the return of crane populations comes the resurgence of old problems, particularly the challenge of protecting local crops from the birds. Farmers have long used methods such as gas cannons and mirrors to divert the cranes to designated feeding sites, but these approaches are costly and disruptive — both to wildlife and to tourists. Now, KKL-JNF Jewish National Fund is developing a laser-based system to address the issue more sustainably. The technology, developed in conjunction with an Israeli ecotech company, employs cameras, lasers and artificial intelligence to detect crane presence and direct a laser beam that the birds perceive as chasing them, causing them to relocate. Charka, who used to work in tech, said he hoped to see the system fully operational by the next migration season. According to the reserve’s director, Inbar Shlomit Rubin, far fewer bird nests were observed in the spring — a trend for which she saw two immediate explanations. 'The unrest and insecurity led many birds to migrate further south to quieter areas of Israel,' she said. But mammals and smaller animals had no means of escaping the area. 'The noise of the war caused immense stress,' Rubin said. 'Stress negatively affects fertility.' Since the ceasefire, KKL-JNF has launched an extensive survey of the areas burned over the past year to evaluate their potential for natural regeneration. For now, most of the organization’s efforts are focused on urgent interventions in visitor-accessible areas. While the restoration of the affected areas is expected to be a long-term endeavor, Hafuta expressed optimism, highlighting forests’ remarkable ability to regenerate. He said he estimated that as many as 70% of burned trees would begin to regenerate naturally in the next year and a half. According to Rubin, in recent weeks, wildlife, too, has begun returning to the affected areas. 'We’ve noticed a very subtle, minimal return. While the long-term effects are still uncertain, we remain hopeful that [the war] won’t have a significant impact in the years to come,' Rubin said. 'The trauma the area experienced will take time to heal, but we are on the right path.'

Red Sox sign Jewish All-Star to record breaking $120 million deal	Since 2017, he’s played at least 145 games in every full season except one, missing time only during the pandemic-shortened 2020 schedule. By Jewish Breaking News The Boston Red Sox answered their critics on Wednesday Since 2017, he’s played at least 145 games in every full season except one, missing time only during the pandemic-shortened 2020 schedule.by signing Gold Glove winner Alex Bregman to a whopping 3-year, $120 million deal. It brings one of baseball’s most visible Jewish stars to Fenway Park after eight standout seasons with the Houston Astros. Drafted second overall in 2015, Bregman quickly became a cornerstone of Houston’s dynasty. After his 2016 call-up, he emerged as a consistent force in the lineup as a third baseman, helping power World Series victories in both 2017 and 2022. His Jewish identity took center stage when he drew a Star of David on his cap following the October 7 Hamas massacre. Power and consistency define Bregman’s offensive approach. He’s crossed the 20-homer threshold in each of the past three seasons. Bregman’s 13.6% strikeout rate ranked in the 94th percentile. His ability to square up pitches placed him 10th among 211 qualified hitters. Beyond the numbers, Bregman brings remarkable durability and playoff experience to Boston. Since 2017, he’s played at least 145 games in every full season except one, missing time only during the pandemic-shortened 2020 schedule. According to ESPN insider Jeff Passan, Bregman is expected to shift to second base, a position he’s played just 32 innings in his major league career. With stars Rafael Devers at third base and Triston Casas at first, Red Sox brass is betting big on Bregman’s successful transition to second base will help return Boston to contention after last year’s mediocre 81-81 finish.

Israel launches three new medical schools to address shortage of ...	According to Nadav Davidovich, Chair of the Taub Center Health Policy Program and Director of the School of Public Health at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel currently gets around 1,300 new doctors per year, with a need of around 2,000. By Anna Epshtein, TPS Israel is opening three new medical schools to address the country’s shortage of medical personnel. One, at the private Reichman University in Herzliya, welcomed its first students ten days ago. Two others, at Haifa University and Weizmann Institute of Science, are to open in October 2025. 'The opening of new medical schools is a significant development that will greatly contribute to the future of Israel’s healthcare system. Increasing the number of medical students will help reduce gaps, strengthen public healthcare, and ensure quality and accessible medical service for every citizen,' the Health Ministry said in a statement, praising the Council for Higher Education that approved the move. The School of Medicine at Reichman University, which opened on February 2, 2025, enrolls 88 graduate students who already have a BA degree in a four-year program. Weizmann Institute of Science will accommodate 40 graduate students in the first year of the program. The students will undergo clinical practice in several Israeli hospitals, including Sheba Medical Center, the largest in Israel. They will be eligible for a double degree—Doctor of Medicine and Doctorate in Research (MDPhD). 'The vision is to create a new generation of leading physician-researchers in the field of medicine and biomedical research. These will be professionals capable of identifying urgent clinical challenges, inviting patients to participate in current clinical trials, and planning and conducting innovative studies that will lead to groundbreaking medical solutions, all with the aim of promoting public health,' the Weizmann Institute statement said. The University of Haifa will accommodate 66 students in the first year and plans to increase enrollment to several dozen students in the coming years. Carmel Medical Center in Haifa will serve as its clinical base. The students will also practice at the medical centers of Clalit Health Services, the largest of Israel’s four state-mandated health service organizations. 'We hope the students will stay in the north after the six years of their studies here,' Roni Malkai, the University’s spokesperson, told TPS-IL. The shortage of medical personnel is especially acute in the Israeli periphery. 'In central Israel, the numbers per capita are close to those in OECD countries, but in the south and the north, they are up to two times lower,' Nadav Davidovich, Chair of the Taub Center Health Policy Program and Director of the School of Public Health at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev explained to TPS-IL. According to him, Israel currently gets around 1,300 new doctors per year, with a need of around 2,000. The shortage of medical personnel is a result of several factors, one of which is that thousands of doctors who came to Israel with the wave of immigration from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s have been retiring. 'The problem is not just the numbers but also the quality of education. Only about 40 percent of practicing doctors in Israel got their diploma in the country,' Davidovich explained. 'The rest studied abroad because there are not enough places in Israel, including in countries where education is poor. They often end up in the Israeli periphery, too.' Establishing new schools is not the only way to address the problem. Israel has also opened programs for physician assistants, who take less time than a full MD, and nurse practitioners (NPs). According to a report published in Israel Health Policy Research a year ago, the number of physicians per capita in Israel is lower than in the OECD countries—3.1 versus 3.5 per 1,000 population, respectively. 'There is a decrease in the supply of physicians in Israel resulting from the declining flow of immigrant physicians from the former Soviet Union, a large proportion of whom have reached retirement age in recent years. This problem could become worse because the number of medical students in Israel cannot increase quickly, especially because the number of clinical training sites is inadequate. The rapid population growth and anticipated aging will exacerbate the shortage,' the report said.

Two Arab Israelis arrested on charges of planning Hamas terror at...	According to the investigation, one of the suspects purchased materials to make fire bombs and 'conducted tests' to produce explosive charges with the intent to attack a bus transporting Israeli troops. By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNS Two Arab Israelis have been arrested on suspicion of planning a series of terrorist attacks against security forces and civilians, the Israel Police and Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) revealed in a statement on Thursday. The suspects, aged 18 and 21, from the towns of Qalansawe and Zemer in central Israel, expressed support for the Hamas terror group following its Oct. 7, 2023, massacre, according to the statement. The two had planned several attacks, including 'a shooting at a military facility and a combined ramming and shooting attack targeting IDF soldiers or civilians,' it continued. According to the investigation, one of the suspects purchased materials to make fire bombs and 'conducted tests' to produce explosive charges with the intent to attack a bus transporting Israeli troops. Following the arrests, a court extended the suspects’ detention. Charges were set to be filed against them on Thursday. In November, two minors from Israel’s 'triangle region' were indicted on charges of conspiring to carry out terrorist acts against security forces. The triangle region contains 11 Arab Israeli communities adjacent to the Green Line and the Samaria security barrier, including Qalansawe and Zemer, and is home to approximately 250,000 people. According to the indictment, one of the minors was recruited to a terror cell in August 2023. He allegedly received training in explosives and subsequently acquired chemical materials to conduct experiments. He then recruited three additional members, including the second minor in the indictment. The pair allegedly worked in collaboration with others, attempted to make bombs and demonstrated an intent to cause harm. Since the start of the Iron Swords war 16 months ago, there has been growing radicalization among some segments of the country’s Arab population. A poll conducted in December 2023 by the Israel Democracy Institute’s Center for Democratic Values and Institutions discovered that one-third of Israel’s Arabs disagree with the statement that the Oct. 7 attack 'does not reflect Arab society, the Palestinian people and the Islamic nation.' According to a June poll, some 14.7% of Arab Israelis believe Hamas should govern Gaza after the war. That number represents some 308,700 Israeli citizens out of an Arab Israeli population of around 2.1 million.

Afghan man arrested after running down dozens in Munich	1 dead, dozens more injured after Afghan migrant rams crowd of labor union protesters in Munich, Germany. By World Israel News Staff At least one person was killed and dozens more injured after a car plowed through a crowd in the city of Munich, Germany on Thursday. The incident occurred near Köingsplatz when a Mini Cooper rammed into a group of labor union protesters representing Verdi, Germany's largest public sector union, who had gathered in Munich to demand wage hikes for teachers and hospital workers. Local reports claim that one woman was killed in the incident, while 28 others were injured. Munich police said Thursday that they arrested the driver of the car, a 24-year-old male migrant from Afghanistan. Markus Söder, premier of the State of Bavaria, told reporters that the ramming was 'likely an attack.' 'The attack shows that something has to change in Germany - and quickly.' Police say the suspect has a history of criminal activity including drug-related offenses and theft. Germany's Der Spiegel reported that the suspect has been living in Germany since 2016, despite his asylum request having been rejected. Local media outlets have claimed the suspect posted radical Islamist materials to his social media accounts. The incident comes just ten days before German voters head to the polls, after snap elections were called following the collapse of the Social Democrats-led center-left government. Immigration is expected to play a major role in this month's federal election, with pre-election polling indicating the right-wing Alternative For Germany (AfD) is poised to become the second largest faction in the Bundestag. Alice Weidel, chairwoman of the AfD and the party's candidate for chancellor, said the attack highlighted the need to radically reform Germany's immigration policies. 'The terror driver from Munich was an Afghan asylum seeker known to police,' Weidel tweeted. 'Once again there are many seriously injured, once again women and children among the victims. My deepest sympathy goes out to the victims and their families. Should this continue forever? Migration turnaround now!'

Ex-IDF deputy chief accuses Netanyahu’s office of treason	Yair Golan, who leads the far-left party The Democrats and once served as deputy chief of the IDF, calls for investigation of Prime Minister Netanyahu's office, accusing aides of betraying Israel to Qatar. By World Israel News Staff A former Israeli lawmaker and chief of a far-left party in the Israeli Knesset accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's staff of treason on Thursday, and called for a criminal investigation of the Prime Minister's Office, citing aides' alleged financial ties to Qatar. Yair Golan, a former deputy chief of staff of the Israeli military who served as a deputy minister in the Bennett-Lapid government and became the head of the far-left The Democrats party last year, held a press conference Thursday afternoon accusing Netanyahu's office of betraying the State of Israel and demanding police launch a criminal probe. 'There is a suspicion of betrayal in the Prime Minister's Office that must be investigated,' Golan said. 'The recent revelation is not another failure, it is not another corruption event or political scandal, and it is not a misjudgment – it is allegedly evidence of a business, financial, and personal connection between the Prime Minister's Office and an enemy state before and during the war,' Golan said, noting Qatar's long-standing ties to Hamas. 'Netanyahu's closest advisors – people from the most important office in the State of Israel – allegedly received payments, maintained connections, and did business with the country that funded Hamas, a country whose leader sees Sheikh Qaradawi, a declared antisemite and prominent Israel-hater, as its spiritual teacher.' Golan held the press conference two days after Israel's Channel 12 published a report accusing PMO staffer Eli Feldstein, who worked on Netanyahu's media team, of having worked as part of a public relations team on behalf of Qatar while employed by the PMO. Feldstein is currently under house arrest in connection to the alleged leaking of government documents to the German daily Bild. Three months earlier, a report by Ha'aretz accused two other PMO employees, Yonatan Urich and Srulik Einhorn, of providing public relations services to Qatar prior to the 2022 World Cup, held in Qatar. Under the international soccer league FIFA's rules, Qatar was required to permit Israel's team and Israeli fans to enter the country, despite Doha having no official diplomatic ties to Israel at the time. A temporary Israeli consulate was established in Qatar for the World Cup to provide basic services for visiting Israelis.

Knesset backs bill to deport illegal Eritrean immigrants	Israeli parliament votes unanimously to advance legislation to deport illegal immigrants from Eritrea who express support for their native land's regime. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A bill to deport Eritreans who illegally entered Israel if they support their home government passed a preliminary reading in the Knesset 51-0 Wednesday. Yulia Malinovsky of the Opposition’s Israel Beytenu party, who submitted the proposed law in December, wrote in its explanatory portion that 'an infiltrator who supports the Eritrean regime, from which he fled on the grounds that his life was in danger, is not truly in danger and therefore is not entitled to reside in the State of Israel.' The bill allows the Interior Minister to deport such infiltrators either to their homeland or to a third country after proving that they support the regime, and it supplied several examples of such backing: organizing or participating in an event whose purpose is to show support for the government of President Isaias Afwerki, including events sponsored by the Eritrean embassy, and/or waving a picture of the country’s leader. The bill also gives the minister the right to immediately deport infiltrators if they have been convicted of an offense, whether they have been sentenced to prison time for committing the crime or not. All infiltrators notified of the intent to deport them will have the right to a hearing to present their arguments against such action. According to data from the Population and Immigration Authority, there are currently about 19,000 asylum seekers in Israel from Eritrea, and another 4,000 from Sudan. It is not known exactly how many of the illegal migrants back Afwerki, who has ruled the one-party state since Eritrea declared independence in 1993. However, there have been mass, violent melees between regime supporters and opponents in recent years, especially where the migrant community is concentrated in south Tel Aviv. In September 2023, there was a massive riot in the city in which some 200 brawlers were injured, many storefronts were damaged and widespread looting occurred. Just a few weeks later, two migrants were murdered in separate clashes in Netanya and Tel Aviv, with police in full riot gear needed to break up the violence. South Tel Aviv was the site of yet another deadly riot last May, when 50 police officers and more than 160 Eritreans were injured from being clubbed, knifed or shot. Last month, Ynet reported that the Eritrean government has paid financial guarantees to release supporters arrested in Israel following incidents of violence, theft, vandalism, and other crimes. Residents of southern Tel Aviv have been complaining for well over a decade about their inability to live normal lives among the thousands of mostly young, single illegal migrants who have taken over the streets. They have accused the police of ignoring their plight instead of showing a robust presence and thoroughly investigating all reported crimes, which have included sexual assault and rape, as well as the more common house break-ins and muggings. Malinovsky said that the bill’s preliminary passage was 'the first step in returning safety and quiet to the residents of south Tel Aviv. It is inconceivable that Israeli citizens are too afraid to leave their homes after dark.'

This legal action follows a similar lawsuit against Illinois, signaling the DOJ’s intensified efforts to enforce federal immigration laws. By Jewish Breaking News Attorney General Pam Bondi announces that the Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the State of New York, Governor Kathy Hochul, Attorney General Letitia James, and DMV Commissioner Mark Schroeder. 'This is a new DOJ,' Bondi declared. 'New York has chosen to prioritize illegal aliens over American citizens. It stops. It stops today.' The lawsuit challenges New York’s 'green light law,' which allows illegal immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses and restricts state cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

How USAID laundered money to the Taliban	The money-laundering operation required multiple steps and plausible deniability for USAID, the State Department, and the UN. By Daniel Greenfield, Frontpage Magazine In 2022, the DA Afghanistan Bank showed off photos of $40 million in stacks of hundred dollar bills sitting on the tarmac at Kabul International Airport. The Taliban controlled central bank described this as one of three shipments of 'humanitarian aid' amounting to over $100 million. DAB, Afghanistan’s central bank, was headed by Noor Ahmad Agha, a 'specially designated terrorist' who had been named as the 'financier of bomb-making', including the IEDs which had killed over 1,000 American soldiers, and sending money to a sanctioned figure was illegal. Despite that someone had sent a massive fortune in U.S. cash to the Taliban’s terror bank. While no international organization was willing to admit to the cash-smuggling operation, the ultimate responsibility lay with USAID. The $40 million on the tarmac was part of a much larger scheme under which USAID and the State Department provided over $1.7 billion in funding to the UN which then shipped $2.9 billion in cash to Afghanistan. The cash had to be physically shipped because it was illegal for U.S. banks to provide it to the Taliban. USAID was helping finance an illegal operation to circumvent sanctions on terrorists. Following a series of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, today, December 15, 2021, the fourth shipment of humanitarian aid of USD 19.2 million reached Afghanistan and delivered to the Afghanistan International Bank (AIB). pic.twitter.com/ng3IH3ZhS0 &mdash; Da Afghanistan Bank- Afghanistan (@AFGCentralbank) December 15, 2021 When the State Department and USAID claimed that they 'do not provide assistance to or through the Taliban' but work 'with trusted international partners with extensive experience working in challenging environments like Afghanistan', it was a half-truth at best. The 'trusted international partners' included the UN. USAID funded the UN which used an intermediary to purchase the hundred dollar bills from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where Afghanistan’s wealth, claimed by the Taliban, was being held, then contracted with a company, quite possibly Osama bin Laden’s old airline, to fly it to Afghanistan, deposit it in banks, allocate it to NGOs and then use DAB to convert the dollars into local Afghan currency. This Afghan currency was also provided by the United States which funded the printing of 20 billion in Taliban currency by European companies for which the dollars would be exchanged. 'The United States and our partners have been working hard with international banks to facilitate payment transfers from Afghanistan’s central bank to European printing companies,' State Department spokesman Ned Price had told reporters. 'This will address one of the aspects of Afghanistan’s ongoing liquidity crisis, consistent with U.S. efforts to support basic human needs.' Rather than just the ‘foreign aid’ to Afghanistan in the form of the ‘Afghanis’ that it was already arranging to print for the Taliban, the Biden administration sent dollars to them through the UN. Under the guise of humanitarian needs, $1.7 billion was provided to the UN, which used some of the money to buy dollars to fly into Afghanistan, to trade for Afghan currency, which the U.S. had also arranged to have printed on behalf of the Taliban. The exchange left the Taliban’s DAB terrorist bank with large amounts of U.S. currency that it could auction off to its own allies. The arrangement is even worse than it sounds because DAB artificially set the exchange rate of the Afghani to the dollar at a far higher rate than the black market exchange rate. And the Taliban bank used the auctions of the dollars to artificially prop up that exchange rate. USAID’s money laundering scheme not only used the UN to send a fortune in dollars to the Taliban, it allowed their terrorist bank to run a ‘dollar cartel’, buying dollars from the UN through its NGOs at favorable rates and then covertly reselling the dollars back in Pakistan to its ‘dollar cartel’ at much better rates as its rupee struggles against the dollar. During the intermediate step, DAB held ‘auctions’ of the dollars which elements linked to the Taliban, including the Haqqani network allied with Al Qaeda, reportedly ‘won’. The auctions prop up the Afghani currency and keep the Taliban in power. And the Taliban take their share at each step of the process, taxing all the various intermediaries before finally cashing out the money. Sending dollars to Afghanistan only to exchange them for Afghanis which the United States was also arranging for served absolutely no purpose except to give the Taliban liquid currency, but was justified as a way to prop up the Afghani currency as a 'humanitarian aid' measure. The money-laundering operation required multiple steps and plausible deniability for USAID, the State Department, and the UN which insisted that '[n]one of the cash brought into Afghanistan is deposited in the Central Bank of Afghanistan nor provided to the Taliban de facto authorities by the UN.' To the extent this was true, it was because the money was deposited in a 'private bank', allocated to NGOs funded by the UN which then exchanged it with DBA’s assets. USAID was able to claim plausible deniability because it was putting money into pooled UN accounts, which a report by the SIGAR Afghanistan War government watchdog revealed, 'prevents tying humanitarian assistance expenses—including for the purchase and transport of cash into Afghanistan—to a specific donor’s contribution. Putting the money into UN pooled accounts allowed USAID to claim that they 'do not provide assistance to or through the Taliban', they just put money into 'pooled UN accounts' which they do not control, and 'as a result, State and USAID do not know how much of their total contributions to the UN have been used to purchase cash for use in Afghanistan'. The UN deposits the dollars into its accounts in a conveniently unnamed ‘private bank’ in Afghanistan. Its name is surely known to the Taliban authorities, but continues to be unknown to United States officials. From there the money is distributed to the bank accounts of the NGOs funded by the UN. At that point they are most likely converted into Afghanis with DAB’s aid since the supply of the Taliban currency is controlled by Afghanistan’s central bank. That allows the UN to claim that '[n]one of the cash brought into Afghanistan is deposited in the Central Bank of Afghanistan nor provided to the Taliban de facto authorities by the UN.' The cash is not provided to the Taliban or DAB by the UN, but by the groups funded by the UN. The SIGAR report noted that 'a UN official told us that the UN’s liability ends when the recipient PIO and NGOs have the funds in their accounts.' The UN then disavows any liability for providing the money to the Taliban even as UN officials are well aware that it’s happening. The State Department responded to these revelations by falsely claiming that there are no sanctions on Afghanistan, that banks refuse to carry out wire transfers because of 'the lack of profitability' and that 'to the best of our knowledge, no electronic financial delivery systems are currently scalable to meet the liquidity needs of the UN' requiring it to instead convert billions of dollars into paper notes and ship them by plane. None of this is true or even a plausible lie. USAID declined to reply to the government watchdog’s report. The Taliban money laundering scheme was not an exception, it was how USAID, the State Department and the UN have operated for too long, not only in Afghanistan, but in Syria, Yemen, Gaza and many other terrorist areas around the world, using plausible deniability and chains of organizations to avoid accountability and direct responsibility for aiding terrorists. Americans have become the financiers of their worst enemies. It’s time for that to stop.

Report: Israel to settle for return of 3 hostages in exchange for...	Hamas reportedly willing to free 3 Israeli hostages on Saturday, a step Israel has said to have indicated would be enough to maintain the current ceasefire - despite Trump's ultimatum and mixed messages from Prime Minister Netanyahu. By World Israel News Staff The impending collapse of the Gaza ceasefire may have been averted this week, after Israel and Hamas both reportedly expressed a willingness to return to the original terms of the deal, after the Islamic terror group threatened on Monday to delay the return of three Israeli hostages, scheduled to be released on Saturday. On Wednesday, Israel's Walla outlet reported that Jerusalem has indicated to Hamas, via Egyptian and Qatari mediators, that Israel is willing to continue the Gaza ceasefire if Hamas releases three Israeli hostages on Saturday, as originally planned. Multiple Arabic media reports have stated that Hamas has also signalled its willingness to implement the latest hostage release on schedule. Citing an unnamed source, AFP reported that the Egyptian and Qatari interlocutors have secured Hamas' assurance that the Saturday hostage release of three captives will be carried out as planned. 'Hamas has confirmed to Egyptian officials its commitment… to conducting the sixth exchange of prisoners on time, on Saturday, as soon as Israel honors its commitment,' one source said. Another source told AFP that 'there is progress' towards resolving the crisis, adding that Israel has vowed to 'put in place a humanitarian protocol starting this morning.' 'Prefabricated units, tents, fuel, heavy equipment, medicine, materials for repairing hospitals and everything linked to the humanitarian protocol' will be brought into the Gaza Strip, the source continued. President Donald Trump threatened earlier this week that 'all hell' will break loose if Hamas does not return all the remaining hostages this Saturday by noon. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened a full resumption of war if 'our hostages' were not returned by Saturday at noon, without specifying how many hostages would have to be released to keep the truce in place.

Trump talks with Putin about negotiating end to Ukraine war	Trump's call with Putin, the first-known conversation between the presidents since Trump's return to the White House, comes just ahead of the war's third anniversary. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he directed his national security team to 'start negotiations immediately' to end the war in Ukraine following a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'I have asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of the CIA John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, and Ambassador and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, to lead the negotiations which, I feel strongly, will be successful,' Trump posted on Truth Social. 'Millions of people have died in a War that would not have happened if I were President, but it did happen, so it must end. No more lives should be lost!' The Kremlin on Tuesday released American teacher Marc Fogel, who had been serving a 14-year sentence for possessing medical marijuana. Fogel's release 'serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,' Waltz said. Another American citizen was released Wednesday from a prison in Belarus, a close ally of Russia, according to State Department officials. Trump on the campaign trail pledged to end the war swiftly, criticizing then-president Joe Biden for failing to negotiate a resolution to a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people. Trump's call with Putin, the first-known conversation between the presidents since Trump's return to the White House, comes just ahead of the war's third anniversary. Trump said he will call Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday 'to inform him of the conversation.' The president added that his discussion with Putin covered 'the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects.' Zelensky met the same day with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

Hamas forced hostage to stage her own death, smashed in captive’s...	Daniella Gilboa was forced to stage her own death for a propaganda film; a Thai hostage had his teeth smashed in. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The physical and mental torture that Hamas inflicted on the hostages included forcing one hostage to stage her own death and destroying the teeth of another. Daniella Gilboa had to lie still while covered with white powder and debris as a terrorist filmed her for a propaganda video that would falsely claim she was killed in an IDF airstrike in Gaza, her mother said Wednesday. Her captors came in with a camera and told her 'Today we are filming you dead,' which led her to believe that they were going to kill her, Orly Gilboa said. Terrified, she pleaded with them not to murder her. At the end, they used only a blurred picture of Gilboa’s supposed dead body to accompany a statement in November claiming that 'one of the enemy’s female prisoners was killed in an area that is under Zionist aggression in the northern Gaza Strip.' The picture immediately led to fears of her death because it showed a tattoo on the body just like one that Gilboa has. The fact that this preyed greatly on the young IDF observer’s mind could be surmised by the first thing she told her parents upon her release last month. 'When she saw me and my husband for the first time, she apologized for how she caused us to feel this whole time,' her mother said, even though the fault lay solely with Hamas. Last January, Hamas had forced Gilboa and two other hostages to speak on a video it released as a form of psychological warfare on Israel and the hostages' families. Channel 12 reported Wednesday that one of the five Thai workers that the terrorists released last week from Gaza had had his teeth smashed in by one of his captors, who slammed a rifle butt into his mouth. While he and his friends were beginning their recovery at the Shamir-Assaf Harofeh Medical Center, specialists in the oral and maxillofacial surgery department did extensive repair work on his mouth. Some of the freed Thai hostages also needed treatment for gunshot wounds, and all of them received initial psychological care as well. After spending ten days in the hospital, all five were flown back to their home country. Their physicians have prepared plans for follow-up care to be carried out in Thailand with Israeli funding. This includes continuing to pay for dental treatments for this man until his mouth and teeth are fully rehabilitated. The government has granted the Thais permanent residency rights in Israel in recognition of their horrific treatment at the hands of Israel’s enemies, and they will receive a monthly stipend of NIS9,000 shekels for the rest of their lives as victims of Arab terror. As freedom slowly reinvigorates the hostages Hamas has released in the last month, more stories of the terrorists’ cruelty appear almost every day.
