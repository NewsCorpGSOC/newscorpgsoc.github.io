Columbia University kicks off campus tour of Oct. 7 Hamas sexual ...	The goal is to raise awareness about the Oct. 7 attack and counteract increasing antisemitism on campuses. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner To commemorate the one-year anniversary of the Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Columbia University hosted on Sunday night a screening of 'Screams Before Silence,' a documentary hosted by former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg about sexual violence committed by Hamas terrorists during their onslaught. In the 60-minute documentary, Sandberg interviews eyewitnesses, released hostages, first responders, medical and forensic experts, and survivors of the Hamas terrorist attack about the women and girls who were raped, assaulted, and mutilated by Hamas terrorists, in some cases while being held captive in the Gaza Strip. Sandberg, who is also the founder of LeanIn.org, said in an Instagram post following the screening at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs that 'Screams Before Silence' is going on a college tour this fall and will be screened at more than 100 college and university campuses. The goal is to raise awareness about the Oct. 7 attack and counteract increasing antisemitism on campuses in the US. Sunday night’s screening at Columbia was the official kickoff of the film’s tour across campuses. 'It’s hard to believe that we are here. And it’s more important than ever that students are able to openly discuss the atrocities Hamas committed on Oct. 7 and its aftermath — without fear of intimidation or aggression because of who they are or what they believe,' said Sandberg. 'I hope these screenings continue to be a place for civil and productive discourse.' After the screening at Columbia University, which was coordinated in collaboration with Columbia/Barnard Hillel, Sandberg moderated a panel discussion with Sheila Katz, the CEO of the National Council for Jewish Women, Israeli journalist Nadav Eyal, and professor Magda Schaler-Haynes, who teaches health policy and management at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. 'We talked about the widespread refusal to condemn Hamas;s sexual violence — including a story I heard that students are walking around some campuses with 'rape is resistance' stickers on their laptops,' Sandberg said. 'We also discussed the rise of antisemitic incidents on campuses: 73 percent of Jewish college students experienced or witnessed antisemitism in the last school year. This scary reality hit close to home when I dropped my child at college a couple of months ago and saw a campus stall with a big sign that read ‘Safety and Security for Jewish Students.'' 'All of us have a role to play in making sure that sexual violence is never used as a tool of war,' she added. 'Rape is never resistance.' Watch the trailer for 'Screams Before Silence' below.

Palestinians caught looting Second Temple-era archaeological site	The site includes ancient storage chambers, cisterns, and a ritual purification bath called a mikvah, which was carved into the rock. By Pesach Benson, TPS Five Palestinians were caught red-handed looting a Second Temple-period archaeological site, the Israel Antiquities Authority announced on Thursday. The incident took place at Kherbet Umm A-Ros, an archaeological site located in the Judean Lowlands of central Israel. The site, home to remains of a Jewish community dating from the Second Temple period and the Bar-Kochba revolt. 'In these difficult times, while many of our employees serve in the reserves, the IAA remains committed to safeguarding our national heritage. These robbers sought to exploit the current instability in Israel to steal from our past. Protecting our antiquities is a national mission,' said Antiquities Authority Director Eli Escusido. The looters, described as a squad of 'antique pirates' from the Palestinian village of Zurif, were caught in the act of pillaging the underground system. The system includes ancient storage chambers, cisterns and a ritual purification bath called a mikvah, that was carved into the rock. The robbers were apprehended by police and the Antiquities Authority’s Robbery Prevention Unit. According to the Antiquities Authority, the group of Palestinians were found actively digging at the site, aiming to extract valuable artifacts such as ancient coins. The thieves brought metal detectors and digging tools to assist in their illegal excavation efforts. Four were arrested in one of the underground chambers while a fifth was stationed outside as a lookout. 'Antiquities robbers travel from miles away, entering the country illegally, and then cause irreparable damage to our heritage,' said Dr. Eitan Klein, Deputy Director of the Antiquities Authority’s Robbery Prevention Unit. 'I’m glad we were able to catch these individuals before further harm was done. We will not let anyone steal our history from beneath our feet.'

Made in Iran: Israel displays captured Hezbollah weapons	Some of the weapons seized included anti-tank mines, rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and fake rocks with explosives hidden inside. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel displayed Iranian-made weapons seized from southern Lebanon on Wednesday. 'The weapons you see here have been stored in Hezbollah bunkers on the front line for more than a year. We know about it, we saw it and now we take it and make sure Hezbollah won’t be able to use those arms,' a soldier at the Julis army base explained. Pointing to a weapons barrel, the soldier said it was found pointed at an army outpost. 'The rest of the weaponry was for breaking the fence. Really just a few hundred meters from the fence, posing a real threat, and we erased this threat.' 'Here’s an Iranian-made launcher known as Tosan,' an anti-tank missile with a range of four km. 'Here are its rockets found in a village controlled by Hezbollah. Iranian-made anti-personnel mines 'found in big quantities' inside Lebanon and ready to use. Many of the mines were found in bags with an indicator of humidity. 'Everything was ready at a very very high level.' Other weapons seized included anti-tank mines, rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and fake rocks with explosives hidden inside. Sarit Zahavi, president and founder of the Alma Research Center, told The Press Service of Israel in August that Hezbollah doctrine makes extensive use of civilian homes, where many more weapons, including ballistic missiles, are kept. 'Hezbollah stores their weapons everywhere, both between villages and within the villages themselves,' she said. 'By and large, every third house in the Shi’ite villages of south Lebanon is used in some way by Hezbollah for military purposes, be it weapons storage, the entrance of a tunnel, or a launchpad for shooting rockets at Israel,' she explained. Also on Wednesday, two Israelis were killed in Kiryat Shmona during a Hezbollah rocket barrage. The victims were identified as Dvir Sharvit, 43, and his partner, Revital Yehud, 45. The two were walking their dogs when the warning sirens went off. They and the dogs were killed by falling shrapnel. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, the Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities, killing 51 people. According to figures released by the government on Sept. 29, more than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. Israel’s war goals include securely returning northern residents to their homes. Israeli officials demand Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from southern Lebanon in compliance with UN Security Council resolution 1701 which ended the Second Lebanon War of 2006. This includes all areas south of the Litani River such as the cities of Nabatieh and Tyre, as well as the Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.

Hamas-linked agency predicted to win Nobel Peace Prize, sparking ...	Israeli groups protest nomination of UNRWA, the UN relief agency with members linked to Hamas and Islamic Jihad who took part in the October 7th invasion, for the Nobel Peace Prize. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News A United Nations agency which has been linked to Hamas and other Gaza terrorist organizations is predicted to win the Nobel Peace Prize, drawing protests from Israeli non-governmental organizations. A total of 286 nominations have been submitted to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, including 197 individuals and 89 organizations. The identities of the nominees are not revealed by the committee for 50 years, though some have been publicly identified by those who sponsored their candidacy. It is widely predicted that the committee will highlight the ongoing war in Gaza against the Hamas terror organization with its selection, choosing a candidate it perceives as having benefited the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, or worked to end the war altogether. The front-runner, according to the Norwegian Peace Council, is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA for short, which was nominated early this year, despite revelations of the agency’s links to terrorist groups including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, with a number of UNRWA employees accused of taking part in the atrocities of October 7th. UNRWA’s chief, Philippe Lazzarini could also be included in the prize, which is set to be awarded on Friday. Two Israeli civil organizations, the Regavim Movement and Im Tirtzu, both condemned the committee’s consideration of UNRWA and urged committee members not to vote for the UN agency. 'The nomination of UNRWA to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize is a perversion of the mission and symbolism of the Prize and would represent an ineradicable stain upon its significance,' Im Tirtzu wrote to the committee in an open letter. 'UNRWA has been an active participant and an ally of Hamas in the massacre Hamas inflicted upon innocent Israeli civilians on October 7, 2023.' More than 12,000 Israelis signed onto a petition protesting the nomination of UNRWA, the organization added. 'We call on the prize committee not to stain the Prize with the blood found on the hands of UNRWA employees,' said Im Tirtuz CEO Shai Rosengarten. The Regavim Movement protested UNRWA’s nomination, submitting faux nominations to the Norwegian Nobel Committee for Hamas politburo chief Yahya Sinwar, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram, and internment camps in China used to house members of the Uyghur minority group. 'If UNRWA, with its documented involvement in terrorism, is eligible for a prize meant to honor peace, it's only fair to consider other organizations with similar records,' said Regavim's spokesperson. 'We urge the Norwegian Nobel Committee to reassess its candidate selection, and to issue a clear and unequivocal statement condemning the activities of Hamas and repudiating UNRWA's candidacy for any recognition or accolades - particularly not for a prize celebrating peace and human rights.' Israel’s Knesset is currently considering legislation, backed by both Opposition and Coalition lawmakers, to bar UNRWA from operating in the country. Other leading candidates include the International Court of Justice in The Hague over its rulings against Russia in the Ukraine war and against Israel regarding its operation in Rafah, as well as United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Asle Sveen, a Nobel Prize expert and historian, told Barron’s that the committee could select Guterres as a way of boosting the standing of the United Nations. 'The UN needs all the support and attention the organization can get to survive against the forces which in reality claim might is right,' Sveen said. 'A Peace Prize to Antonio Guterres will give him a unique opportunity to&#8230; warn against the dangers of making the UN and the world order irrelevant.'

Arab-Israeli ISIS terrorists plotted massive bombing of Tel Aviv ...	Israeli security forces foil major plot by domestic ISIS cell to bomb Tel Aviv's iconic Azrieli Mall. By World Israel News Staff A major terrorist plot targeting the Azrieli Mall in Tel Aviv was foiled by Israeli police and security forces recently. The planned bombing was thwarted by a joint operation involving the Israel Police and the Shin Bet internal security agency. The operation culminated in the arrest of five residents of the Arab-Israeli town of Taybeh who are suspected of establishing a terror cell affiliated with the Islamic State in Syria (ISIS) terror group. Criminal charges are slated to be filed soon in the case. The plot was uncovered by Shin Bet and police investigators during a covert month-long probe focusing on five Taybeh residents. The cell was planning a massive car bombing attack on Azrieli Mall as part of ISIS activities. The leaders of the terror cell were identified as Mahmoud Azam and Ibrahim Sheikh Yusuf, both residents of Taybeh. The pair were arrested during the early stages of the investigation. It was revealed that the two had intentions to travel abroad to join ISIS combat zones, and had maintained connections with foreign ISIS operatives. They recruited three additional Taybeh residents—Sajjad Mazarweh, Abdallah Baransi, and Abd Al-Karim Baransi—to support their terrorist activities within Israel. Following meticulous evidence gathering, the police department’s Gideon counter-terror unit, in collaboration with Taybeh station police officers, apprehended the suspects and seized various materials in their possession. During interrogations, the suspects admitted that they had studied online footage of car bomb attacks in Syria and discussed the quantity of explosive material required to carry out a major attack on Azrieli Mall. In response to the investigation's conclusions, the Shin Bet and Israel Police emphasized the severity of this organized and dangerous local threat aligned with ISIS ideology. 'Thanks to the integrated and professional investigation by the police and Shin Bet, a major disaster was averted, and lives were saved,' stated Central District Commander Yair Hatzroni. 'We view any extremist ideological intent to undermine Israeli security with utmost seriousness and will continue to act decisively within our legal authority to preempt any future threats.' Based on the comprehensive evidential basis, a pretrial detention request has been submitted to the courts, with criminal charges expected to follow against the suspects in the coming days.

Biden reassures Iran US will not aid Israeli attack on nuclear si...	The Biden administration reportedly told Iran, via Saudi Arabia, that the US won't help Israel take out Iranian nuclear facilities as retaliation for October 1st ballistic missile attacks. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration has reassured the Iranian government that the U.S. will not target Iran’s nuclear facilities nor aid Israel in striking them in reprisal for the October 1st ballistic missile attacks, France 24 has reported. Last Tuesday, Iran launched roughly 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel, the second large-scale direct attack by Iran on the Jewish state, following a combination ballistic missile and drone attack in April. Senior Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, vowed Israel would 'exact a price' from Iran in response to the attack. Israel’s leadership is reportedly considering a number of Iranian targets, including elements of Iran’s nuclear program, as well as the country’s oil and natural gas extraction and refinement facilities. According to a report this week by Sky News, the Biden administration is pressuring Israel not to attack Iran’s nuclear sites. Now, France 24 reported, the U.S. has promised Iran that it will not enable or aid any Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear program. The reassurance was reportedly conveyed via Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of the oil-rich Sunni kingdom. Bin Salman is said to have passed the Biden White House’s message on to Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s minister of foreign affairs. Earlier this week, The Wall Street Journal reported that President Joe Biden was angered by Israel’s refusal to share its plans for a retaliatory strike on Iran. For its part, Israel has reportedly refused Biden’s demand to take strikes on Iran’s nuclear program off the table. Biden and Netanyahu spoke by phone Wednesday, marking the first conversation between the two leaders in six weeks. Vice President Kamala Harris joined in on the call, which focused on Iran’s ballistic missile attack, Israel’s planned response, the ongoing wars in Lebanon and Gaza, and the administration’s fears of a wider regional conflict.

Brown University rejects pro-Palestinian protesters’ demand to di...	The Ivy League school in Providence, Rhode Island was among the first this past spring to agree to hold a vote on divestment in exchange for a peaceful end to its student encampment. By Andrew Lapin, JTA Brown University’s board of governors has rejected a closely scrutinized, student-led proposal to divest from companies with business in Israel. The rejection allays concerns expressed by some pro-Israel groups that the divestment movement was gaining momentum after the pro-Palestinian student encampments at universities across the country last spring. 'Baruch Hashem,' Rabbi Josh Bolton, executive director of Brown/RISD Hillel, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, using a Hebrew term akin to 'Thank God.' Bolton said the vote 'is a definitive and powerful rejection of divestment on every level.' Coming so soon after the first anniversary of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel was also significant, he said: 'After a year of insanity, antisemitic sloganeering, maligning of Jewish students, this is a day that we can be proud of our institutions.' The vote was in the works and debated for months before taking place on Tuesday, months before it was expected, by secret ballot. The Brown Corporation agreed with an internal committee that had voted 8-2, with one abstention, to recommend rejecting divestment. 'The Corporation reaffirmed that Brown’s mission is to discover, communicate and preserve knowledge. It is not to adjudicate or resolve global conflicts,' the board wrote in a lengthy statement Wednesday explaining its vote. The Ivy League school in Providence, Rhode Island was among the first this past spring to agree to hold a vote on divestment in exchange for a peaceful end to its student encampment. The encampments often pushed for divestment, while Jewish students reported being antagonized by the pro-Palestinian activists. Protesters at Brown were motivated by, among other factors, a Palestinian student who was shot in Vermont in November in an apparent hate crime. After dismantling their encampment, Brown student activist leaders were permitted to make their formal case for divestment to the board; similar deals were also struck at Northwestern University, the University of Minnesota and elsewhere. An internal committee then considered the case but kept its report private until Wednesday, after the formal vote was announced. Leading up to the vote, Brown would only confirm that it was scheduled for October but provided no other details on timing. Among its chief rationales for rejecting divestment, the committee determined that Brown was not heavily nor directly invested in the 10 companies included in the proposal 'and that any indirect exposure for Brown in these companies is so small that it could not be directly responsible for social harm.' Those 10 companies included Boeing, General Electric, Motorola, Volvo and Northrop Grumman, all of which the divestment proposal said 'facilitate the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory.' The school’s leadership declared it was satisfied with the process and the results of the divestment vote. 'Brown’s mission doesn’t encompass influencing or adjudicating global conflict,' Christina Paxson, the school’s Jewish president, and chancellor Brian Moynihan said in a joint statement shared with the school, alumni and press. 'Our greatest contribution to the cause of peace for which so many members of the community have advocated is to continue to educate future leaders and produce scholarship that informs and supports their work. A decision to divest would greatly jeopardize our ability to continue to make this contribution.' Paxson and Moynihan continued, 'If the Corporation were to divest, it would signal to our students and scholars that there are ‘approved’ points of view to which members of the community are expected to conform. This would be wholly inconsistent with the principles of academic freedom and free inquiry, and would undermine our mission of serving the community, the nation and the world.' Some Jews had been angry that the vote was happening at all. One Jewish member of the Brown Corporation resigned in protest over it, saying the school had capitulated to extremists. He was rebuked by Paxson, who has long argued that the vote was happening in accordance with Brown’s usual procedures for considering divestment-related proposals. At least 100 Brown faculty members publicly supported divestment, while the Anti-Defamation League and other Jewish groups have ardently argued against college Israel divestments in general. Dozens of Republican state attorneys general had warned Brown that any move toward divestment could result in pushback from their states. The Rhode Island chapter of the anti-Zionist group Jewish Voice for Peace, which had advocated for divestment alongside other pro-Palestinian groups, did not immediately return a request for comment. The Brown Divest Coalition, together with the national Students for Justice in Palestine movement, posted a profane message on Instagram directed at the Corporation and Paxson, concluding with 'Free Palestine' and, in all caps, 'All settler colonial institutions will fail.' Paxson and Moynihan concluded their communication on the vote with a plea that the university community maintain civility even in disagreement. 'Whether you support, oppose or have no opinion on the decision of the Corporation, we hope you will do so with a commitment to sustaining, nurturing and strengthening the principles that have long been at the core of our teaching and learning community,' they said.

German reporter arrested in Lebanon after appearing on Israeli ne...	Paul Ronzheimer and his team were abducted from their hotel room and released only after the German embassy intervened. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A German reporter was arrested and questioned in Lebanon just a day after he appeared on an Israeli news channel describing what he saw of the IDF assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. Neither the Bild newspaper, nor the Die Welt news channel, who both employ senior war correspondent Paul Ronzheimer, claimed that the arrest was a result of the interview. They both reported Wednesday that Ronzheimer and his team had been abducted from their hotel rooms on September 28, the day after the IDF airstrike. The journalists were handcuffed and blindfolded, then taken to an unknown location and interrogated for hours, 'probably by Lebanese military intelligence,' the Die Welt report said. After some 12 hours, they were then released, thanks to the intervention of the German Embassy in Beirut. Ronzheimer actually continued reporting from the Lebanese capital for several more days before flying home. This accounted for the delay in reporting his abduction, his media colleagues said, as they wanted to make sure he was safe before publicizing what had happened. The Bild report noted that Hezbollah had posted Ronzheimer’s picture on social media the morning of his arrest, along with an accusation that he had violated unspecified 'conditions.' The terror organization, which controls much of Lebanese life both as part of the government and behind the scenes, rarely lets reporters into the country anymore, Bild reported Ronzheimer as noting. The journalist was undeterred by his experience, saying that he would 'of course continue to report on this war,' even though 'it is currently very difficult for many reporters to report on what is happening.' In his interview on Channel 11 on September 27, Ronzheimer said he had just returned to the center of town from the area of the bombing of Nasrallah’s headquarters, which was hidden deep underground in the Dahiyeh neighborhood of Beirut. 'We felt the whole explosion, six times,' he said, 'and it was really, really heavy to feel it here.' He spoke of the then-conflicting reports of whether Nasrallah had been killed in the attack, saying that no journalists were being allowed into the area to investigate the incident or the aftermath for themselves. Ronzheimer is very well known in his home country, thanks to his news reports and his being a regular guest on all major political talk shows on TV.

Walz has made a series of verbal blunders that his campaign has had to clean up, including false claims about being present at the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. By Matthew Xiao, The Washington Free Beacon The Harris campaign walked back Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s Tuesday claim that the Electoral College 'needs to go,' saying that it is not an official campaign position. 'I think all of us know the Electoral College needs to go. We need, we need national popular vote, but that’s not the world we live in,' Walz said at a campaign fundraiser in California. The campaign clarified later that the Harris-Walz ticket is not advocating for eliminating the Electoral College. 'Governor Walz believes that every vote matters in the Electoral College,' a campaign official told CNN, adding that Walz 'was commenting to a crowd of strong supporters about how the campaign is built to win 270 electoral votes.' Walz has made a series of verbal blunders that his campaign has had to clean up, including false claims about being present at the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. During the vice presidential debate on October 1, Walz admitted that he can be 'a knucklehead at times.' During her 2020 presidential campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris said she was 'open to the discussion' of abolishing the Electoral College. 'There’s no question that the popular vote has been diminished in terms of making the final decision about who’s the president of the United States and we need to deal with that, so I’m open to the discussion,' Harris said during a 2019 interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live.

Justice Department charges Afghan citizen with plotting to commit...	The Justice Department report alleges that Tawhedi obtained, viewed, and saved ISIS propaganda on his digital devices. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has issued charges against an Afghan citizen allegedly plotting to execute a terrorist attack during Election Day at the behest of Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, a 27-year old resident of Oklahoma City, schemed to help ISIS commit an act of terrorism on American soil through the acquisition of firearms and ammunition, according to the federal officials. Tawhedi allegedly sold many of his assets and moved several family members out of the United States as part of his preparations for the terrorist attack. 'As charged, the Justice Department foiled the defendant’s plot to acquire semi-automatic weapons and commit a violent attack in the name of ISIS on U.S. soil on Election Day,' said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. 'We will continue to combat the ongoing threat that ISIS and its supporters pose to America’s national security, and we will identify, investigate, and prosecute the individuals who seek to terrorize the American people.' 'This defendant, motivated by ISIS, allegedly conspired to commit a violent attack, on Election Day, here on our homeland,' said FBI Director Christopher Wray. While investigating Tawhedi, the FBI surfaced messages between Tawhedi and an ISIS-connected individual 'who facilitated recruitment, training, and indoctrination of persons who expressed interest in terrorist activity.' In addition, the Justice Department report alleges that Tawhedi obtained, viewed, and saved ISIS propaganda on his digital devices. He also sent messages in a Telegram account affiliated with ISIS and sent money to sham 'charity organizations' which fundraise for the terrorist group. While Tawhedi and an alleged partner, who is a minor, were in the process of selling his assets in advance of the planned terrorist attack, an individual connected with the FBI contacted him under the guise of purchasing a computer. During their communications, the individual informed Tawhedi that they were in the process of launching a new gun business. Tawhedi and his partner eventually met up with the FBI-connected individual in rural Oklahoma on Oct. 7 with the goal of purchasing firearms to carry out the terrorist attack. The duo successfully bought and took possession of 'two AK-47 assault rifles, ten magazines, and 500 rounds of ammunition.' The agency slapped Tawhedi charges of 'conspiring and attempting to provide material support to ISIS,' and 'receiving a firearm to be used to commit a felony or a federal crime of terrorism.' In recent months, the DOJ has been busy holding foreign extremists accountable for planning or committing acts of terrorism on American soil. In September, the agency announced charges against several top leaders of the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas for orchestrating the Oct. 7 massacre across southern Israel. That same month, the agency thwarted a planned shooting against New York Jews by a Pakistani national.

Israeli strike on Iran will be ‘lethal, precise, and surprising’	Defense Minister threatens that Iranian regime 'won't know what hit them' after Israeli retaliatory strike. By World Israel News Staff Defense Minister Yoav Gallant threatened that Israel's expected counter-strike on Iran will include a devastating blow to the Islamic regime. 'Whoever attacks us will be hurt and will pay a price. Our attack will be lethal, precise and above all surprising, they will not understand what happened and how it happened, they will see the results,' Gallant said of the retaliatory strike in a video statement on Wednesday. On October 1st, Iran launched an unprecedented barrage of some 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel. Despite the Iron Dome intercepting most of the projectiles, some of the missiles did impact military bases throughout the country, causing damage to several air force bases. In a statement, the IDF said that the impacts had not hampered the military's operational abilities. Shortly after the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had 'made a big mistake' by launching its second direct attack on Israel within six months, and that it would face serious consequences for the aerial assault. Netanyahu also appeared to hint that assassinating senior Iranian figures, such as the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameinei, was an option being considered by Israel. 'When Iran is finally free — and that moment will come a lot sooner than people think – everything will be different,' Netanyahu said in a video statement addressing Iranians citizens. Israel has yet to respond to the attacks, with U.S. President Joe Biden pressuring Jerusalem to avoid striking Iran's nuclear development sites or oil assets. Biden also urged Israel to respond 'proportionately' to what is believed to be one of the largest ballistic missile attacks in history. Much to the chagrin of the Biden administration, Israel has reportedly refused to share its plans for the attack with Washington.

WH press secretary won’t say if Biden dropped F-bomb on Netanyahu	White House Press Secretary Karein Jean-Pierre 'can't confirm' whether Biden called Israeli Prime Minister a 'f***ing liar' while expressing outrage over Rafah operation, as claimed by new book by Bob Woodward. By World Israel News Staff The White House press secretary was unable to confirm or deny whether President Joe Biden cursed at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a telephone conversation earlier this year, and repeatedly used epithets in conversations with others while describing the Israeli leader. On Tuesday, CNN revealed excerpts from Bob Woodward’s upcoming book, War, focusing on the Biden administration’s handling of the Ukraine war, the war between Israel and Hamas, and Donald Trump’s post-presidency. In the excerpts published by CNN, Biden privately trashed both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, repeatedly cursing the two leaders. 'That f***ing Putin,' Biden was quoted as telling advisers after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Regarding Netanyahu, Biden on multiple occasions cursed Netanyahu, including at least one instance in which the comments were made directly to the Israeli premier during a phone call this July, after the IDF bombed a Hezbollah base in Beirut, killing a number of senior terrorists. 'Bibi, what the f***?' Biden shouted. 'You know the perception of Israel around the world increasingly is that you’re a rogue state, a rogue actor,' Biden continued. Netanyahu defended the strike, noting Israel had killed a top Hezbollah terrorist. 'We saw an opportunity and took it,' Netanyahu said, according to Woodward. In private, Biden made excoriated Netanyahu in the spring 2024, after the Israeli military entered Rafah in southern Gaza,' referring to Netanyahu as a 'son of a bitch.' 'That son of a bitch, Bibi Netanyahu, he’s a bad guy. He’s a bad f***ing guy!' 'He’s a f***ing liar,' Biden was also quoted as saying. The president made similar comments about West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, a former Democrat who left the party to become an independent earlier this year, and former President Donald Trump. A day after the CNN report, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was questioned during a press briefing regarding Biden’s alleged statements. Jean-Pierre did not deny the comments, saying only she was unable to confirm the veracity of Woodward’s claims. 'There’s going to be many books that are written about this administration and many administrations,' Jean-Pierre said. 'Nothing atypical about that.' 'What I can say to that question that you asked me: I cannot confirm. That is not something that I can confirm from here.' The press secretary emphasized that the telephone conversation between Biden and Netanyahu earlier that day – the first between the two leaders in six weeks – was 'direct and very productive.'

Immigrant to Israel and IDF reservist killed in Lebanon	Sgt. Maj. (res.) Ronny Ganizate, who was from France, was on his third round of reserve duty when he fell in battle against Hezbollah forces. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Sgt. Maj. (res.) Ronny Ganizate, an immigrant from France who was on his third round of reserve duty, fell in battle in Lebanon, the IDF announced Wednesday. The 36-year-old father of three was a member of Battalion 5030 in the 228th (Alon) Brigade. Another soldier in the same battalion was severely wounded and flown to the hospital. Ganizate had moved to Israel with his 'out of a strong love for the Land of Israel and a desire to be part of and write the history of the Jewish people here,' wrote Ephraim, a personal friend, on Thursday. 'Ronny symbolizes all the values for which we fight,' he wrote. Another friend, David, described the religious reservist who lived in Givat Shmuel as a 'righteous man' and hoped that he would be remembered 'as a hero of Israel.' Everyone who knew him said Ganizate was always smiling and optimistic. Friends of the family said that he had also always taken his reserve duty seriously, going for his periodic training periods 'with great enthusiasm.' He had already served for nearly seven months in two separate rounds since the war broke out last year, before being called up yet again, this time to fight Hezbollah terrorist forces in southern Lebanon. When he had reached home in the summer, he wrote on Facebook about his dedication to the country’s defense and his gratitude to his wife, Shoshana, who had held down the home front when he was away. 'It's good to come home,' he wrote. 'I have to say a huge, big thank you to my wife who holds down the house, the children, and her job, all by herself. You are a superhero, you deserve a special day! Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity and strength to contribute to our country.' 'We chose to immigrate to Israel, we will not allow anyone to harm it,' he continued. 'We will continue to fight until the elimination of our enemies. And many thanks to everyone who helped at home and in the field (equipment, help, support&#8230;)! Together we will win! The nation of Israel lives!' Taking the war to Hezbollah in Lebanon has been a great success so far, according to Chief of Staff Lieut. Gen. Herzi Halevi. 'Hezbollah is making great efforts to hide the significant damage we have done to the organization in recent weeks,' he said Wednesday. 'They have undergoing command and control difficulties that lead to confusion at the decision-making level and challenges in their ability to execute. Even in Iran they still don't understand the depth of the damage to the front post they built on our northern border. We will continue to attack Hezbollah with force, without allowing it respite and recovery.' Ganizate was the tenth soldier to fall in Lebanon since the IDF began its declared mission to return some 60,000 residents to their homes by destroying Hezbollah’s ability to fire missiles at will at the northern part of Israel, as it has done over 8,000 times over the past year.

US ‘deeply concerned’ by Israel banning UNRWA: UN envoy	U.S. Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield downplays UNRWA's terror links, demands Israel solve humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. By World Israel News Staff The United States Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield blasted Israel during a Security Council meeting on Wednesday, appearing to blame the Jewish State for the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip and expressing Washington's disapproval of Israeli efforts to ban UNRWA from operating on its soil. A number of UNRWA employees were found to have participated in the October 7th massacres, with the Hamas terror group deeply infiltrating the organization. Following revelations about UNRWA's ties to terror, the Israeli Knesset is now advancing legislation to ban the UN body from Israel. Speaking to the UN Security Council, Thomas-Greenfield said that the Biden administration is 'deeply concerned' by proposals to ban UNRWA from Israel. She downplayed UNRWA's links to Hamas and other terror groups, claiming that 'only a small percentage' of staffers and employees were terror-affiliated. Therefore, she argued, the body should be permitted to continue its 'vital humanitarian work' in the Gaza Strip. Thomas-Greenfield also appeared to blame Israel for requiring security inspections of humanitarian goods entering the coastal enclave. 'We are&#8230;concerned by recent actions by the Israeli government to limit the delivery of goods into Gaza,' she said. 'When combined with new bureaucratic limits placed on humanitarian goods arriving from Jordan, and the closure of most border crossings in recent weeks, these restrictions would only have the effect of intensifying suffering in Gaza. Thomas-Greenfield did not acknowledge that the Hamas terror group regularly steals humanitarian aid, stockpiling it in warehouses and selling it to Gazans at inflated prices. The U.S. envoy also failed to mention that a humanitarian worker was recently murdered by Hamas gunmen, likely in order to steal the aid she was distributing to civilians. Referencing 'squalid conditions' in displacement camps for Gazans forced out of their homes by the fighting, Thomas-Greenfield placed the onus of responsibility for their wellbeing on Israel. 'These catastrophic conditions were predicted months ago, and yet, have still not been addressed. That must change, and now. We call on Israel to take urgent steps to do so, and I reiterate the United States’ expectation that Palestinian civilians, including those evacuated from the north be permitted to return to their communities and rebuild,' she added.

Couple walking their dogs ID’d as Hezbollah missile victims	Cancer survivor and pasty chef were killed by Hezbollah missile targeting residential area, along with their three dogs. The two people killed in the northern city of Kiryat Shmona in a Hezbollah missile attack were named by Hebrew-language media on Thursday morning as Revital Yehud, 45, and Dvir Sharvit, 43. The couple were out walking their dogs when an air raid siren sounded, and did not manage to reach a bomb shelter before the missile impacted. The attack by Hezbollah directly targeted a residential neighborhood in Kiryat Shmona. The city was officially evacuated in October 2023, but it's believed that a few hundred or thousand residents - including Yehud and Sharvit - chose not to leave their homes. Yehud, originally from Eilat, had lived in Kiryat Shmona for two years. She recently recovered from cancer, according to Hebrew-language media reports. Her boyfriend, Sharvit, was a professional pasty chef working in the Galilee region. 'We lost an amazing man who was all heart. A man who loved to help others,' said Meir Ben Shitrit, a relative of Sharvit. 'We feel like we are in a bad dream, but unfortunately this is our terrible reality.' 'Our hearts are broken. We can't believe that Revital is no longer with us,' said Yehud's family in a media statement. 'She was a woman full of good intentions.' Her family referenced the upcoming Yom Kippur holiday, which begins this Friday. 'They say that when one's soul returns to the Creator of the World before Yom Kippur, that person is saintly. And Revital was saintly,' the family added. Sharvit will be buried in Kiryat Arba, while Yehud will be buried in Beer Sheva. At around 2:00 p.m. on Wednesday, sirens sounded in Kiryat Shmona. Several minutes later, the Magen David Adom ambulance service received calls from residents reporting that missiles had struck their neighborhood. Emergency paramedics scanned the scenes near the impacts, discovering the bodies of Yehud and Sharvit. The couple's three dogs were also killed in the blast.

‘I’m a Zionist’ – Biden defends Israel record in pre-Yom Kippur c...	Biden reaffirms support for Israel, saying Jews worldwide would be endangered if Israel did not exist. By World Israel News Staff President Joe Biden spoke with American rabbis Wednesday ahead of the Yom Kippur holiday, which begins Friday at sundown. Continuing the tradition of annual High Holiday conference calls with Jewish spiritual leaders, the president defended his record on Israel and reiterated his support for Zionism. 'You’ve heard me say before that I got very badly criticized as a young senator, saying, ‘I’m a Zionist.’ You don’t have to be a Jew to be a Zionist, that’s not necessary, and the idea, I firmly believe, without an Israel, every Jew in the world’s security is less stable – I mean that,' Biden said. 'It doesn’t mean that Jewish leadership doesn’t have to be more progressive than it is, but it does mean it has to exist, and that’s what worries me most about what’s going on now.' 'You’ve heard me say before that my commitment to the safety of the Jewish people and the security of Israel as the right to exist is independent — independent of that — of everything else. The Jewish state has to remain. It has to remain — the ironclad commitment to it,' Biden continued. Biden highlighted last Tuesday’s ballistic missile attack on Israel, in which some 200 missiles were launched, and the role of the American military in aiding the IDF in intercepting the projectiles. 'You know, at my direction, last week, the United States military took unprecedented action again to actively assist the successful defense of Israel.' The president called October 7th a 'second, smaller holocaust,' and recalled his visit to Israel after the Hamas invasion. 'But when I went over shortly after… I saw the remnants of what had happened 10 days earlier. I saw — and the — anyway, you all know; you understand it.' Biden said the White House 'will not rest' until all Israeli hostages taken captive on October 7th are returned. 'My administration is doubling down on our work to secure the release of the remaining hostages, just as we have freed hostages already. And we will not rest until they’re all home.' 'As you saw just last week, the United States fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Iran and all its proxies — Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis. We’re doing everything we can to ease the suffering of all the people from this war against Hamas and that Hamas started.'

Harris joins call as Netanyahu speaks with Biden for first time i...	President Biden discusses Israel’s plans for strike on Iran in retaliation for massive ballistic missile attack. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on the phone Wednesday, the first conversation the two leaders have had in six weeks. Biden and Netanyahu spoke for 50 minutes, with Vice President Kamala Harris joining in on the call. According to a statement by the White House, the call focused on Iran’s October 1st ballistic missile attack on Israel, in which some 200 missiles were launched from Iranian territory – the second such attack by Iran since April. The two leaders also discussed Israel’s plans to retaliate for the missile attack, amid reports Biden has grown increasingly frustrated over Jerusalem’s refusal to fully disclose its plans. Biden has repeatedly called on Israel to avoid striking Iran’s nuclear facilities or oil assets, with Israel’s leadership declining to commit not to hit either target. The White House said that during the telephone call, Biden 'affirmed his ironclad commitment to Israel’s security,' and 'condemned unequivocally Iran’s ballistic missile attack against Israel on October 1st.' The president and the Israeli premier also discussed the war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, with Biden emphasizing 'the need for a diplomatic arrangement to safely return both Lebanese and Israeli civilians to their homes on both sides of the Blue Line.' Biden 'affirmed Israel’s right to protect its citizens from Hezbollah, which has fired thousands of missiles and rockets into Israel over the past year alone, while emphasizing the need to minimize harm to civilians, in particular in the densely populated areas of Beirut.' Regarding the war in Gaza, Biden reiterated his call to renew diplomatic efforts to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas, and also discussed the humanitarian situation in Gaza, while pushing Israel to 'restore access to the north' of Gaza and to expand the aid corridor from Jordan across Israel.

Hamas official calls ceasefire demand to exile Sinwar to Sudan ‘s...	News that Sinwar was alive and in contact with Qatari officials put to rest rumors that he had been killed in an Israeli airstrike. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A member of Hamas's political bureau, Izzat al-Rishq, dismissed a proposal to spare Hamas leader Sinwar's life and allow him to live as an exile in Sudan in exchange for the hostages as 'an Israeli illusion' and 'stupid.' He said, 'Deporting Hamas or its leaders from Gaza is an Israeli dream and illusion that will not come true.' 'The report in one of the enemy's newspapers regarding the deportation of Hamas leaders to Sudan is a stupid statement,' al-Rishq said. 'We said in the past and we repeat and say now, that Hamas is in Palestine, fighting the enemy that is occupying Palestine,' he continued. 'Logic requires that the criminal occupier leave and the original inhabitants of the land remain.' Izzat al-Rishq was responding to a report by Kan Reshet Bet that Israel sent an updated hostage proposal to the United States. The new agreement would demand the return of all remaining hostages in a single phase in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners, the demilitarization of Gaza, and allowing safe passage for Yahya Sinwar out of Gaza to Sudan. News that Sinwar was alive and in contact with Qatari officials put to rest rumors that he had been killed in an Israeli airstrike. The IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate considered the possibility that Sinwar was in fact killed when Israeli warplanes bombed a tunnel where the terrorist leader was suspected to be hiding, Kan, Ma’ariv, Walla, and Ha’aretz all reported. However, on Wednesday, Yahya Sinwar, who was thought to be dead, reemerged and demanded the terror group resume its use of suicide bombings inside Israeli cities, leading some within Hamas to describe Sinwar as a 'megalomaniac,' The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.

Israeli UN Ambassador Danon slams Hezbollah for urging ceasefire ...	Danon said a ceasefire would be contingent on the cessation of Hezbollah's attacks against Israel and a retreat to the north of the Litani River. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon criticized the hypocrisy of Hezbollah's demand for a ceasefire while it continues to target and kill Israeli civilians. On Wednesday, before a UN Security Council meeting, Danon said, 'We have once again been reminded of the relentless terror we face.' He described the terrorist attacks that occurred in Israel on Wednesday, including a stabbing in Hadera that wounded 6 people, 2 critically. Danon added, 'In Kiryat Shmona, Hezbollah's rockets murdered a man and a woman who were simply walking their dog.' This occurred just a day after senior Hezbollah official, Naim Qassem, called for a ceasefire. Danon said, 'And yet, even as Hezbollah continues their murderous campaign, senior Hezbollah officials have the audacity that Israel ceasefire.' 'Let me be clear about that,' he said. 'No one should mistake the arrogance of these terrorists for diplomacy. Hezbollah calls for a ceasefire while simultaneously murdering Israeli civilians with their rockets.' Danon added that if Hezbollah wants a ceasefire they must first stop firing missiles into Israel and to retreat to the area north of the Litani River in accordance with UN Resolution 1701, which was adopted by the UN Security Council in 2006. Danon said, 'Until that happens, Israel will continue our operations to degrade Hezbollah's terror network.' He commented on the weapons, including a 25 meter tunnel close to the border with Israel the IDF discovered destroyed. 'We will do whatever it takes to secure our people and enable the 70,000 displaced Israelis to return home safely.' On Tuesday, Naim Qassem, the most senior Hezbollah leader after the assassination of Nasrallah and his successor Safieddine, called for an unconditional ceasefire, apparently not contingent on a cessation of fighting in Gaza. The former deputy to Hassan Nasrallah and member of Hezbollah’s Jihad Council announced on Tuesday night that the terror group was 'agreeing to a ceasefire without preconditions. First, a ceasefire achieved through diplomatic means, and then we will discuss all the details.'

As Florida braces for Hurricane Milton, this rabbi is defying an ...	The region is home to an estimated 50,000 Jews, according to the Jewish Press of Tampa, and is home to dozens of synagogues and Jewish institutions. By Jackie Hajdenberg, JTA By order of the government of Fort Myers, Florida, Rabbi Yitzchok Minkowicz should have left his home and joined the mass of cars crawling out of the state’s southwest in advance of Hurricane Milton, which is due to make landfall Wednesday afternoon. Instead, Myers is staying put and planning to host Yom Kippur services on Friday night and Saturday. He is also offering his home, which doubles as a synagogue, as a shelter from the storm — estimated to be the most powerful to strike the region in recent history. 'Chabad is in Zone A, which is actually a mandatory evacuation,' Minkowicz told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency on Tuesday. 'So if I was an individual, I probably would leave.' He went on, 'But since I’m a rabbi, and we have a synagogue, and we have people that need help, so there’s no way I can leave. So we’re going to stay here and help people, and God will help us.' By remaining in place, Minkowicz was the exception to the rule — but he was far from the only local Jewish leader trying to negotiate the demands of Judaism’s holiest day with the danger posed by the oncoming storm, which is poised to do massive damage to the Tampa Bay area, including the cities of Tampa, Fort Myers, Sarasota and St. Petersburg. Rabbi Yitzchok Minkowicz of Chabad of Southwest Florida posted a video showing storm preparations as Hurricane Milton bore down on the region, Oct. 8, 2024. (Screenshot from Youtube) Many other Jewish institutions called off ceremonies to commemorate the first anniversary of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel so residents could evacuate in time, and scrapped or rejiggered services planned for Yom Kippur. 'Due to the circumstances surrounding Hurricane Milton, we have made the difficult decision to cancel our Yom Kippur services,' read a message posted on Facebook on Tuesday by Eitz Chaim Congregation Sarasota. Below the announcement, a Yom Kippur graphic was overlaid with a red notice reading, 'Services canceled due to Hurricane Milton.' 'The safety of our community is our top priority during this time,' the synagogue said. 'We encourage everyone to take necessary precautions and stay informed about the storm’s developments. Our prayers and attention are with all those affected by this powerful hurricane.' The region is home to an estimated 50,000 Jews, according to the Jewish Press of Tampa, and is home to dozens of synagogues and Jewish institutions. Congregation Beth Am of Tampa posted late on Tuesday that it still aimed to hold Yom Kippur services but had put in place multiple contingency plans. 'Our hope is to be able to gather in person, as usual. And, if it’s at all possible, that’s what we’ll do,' Rabbi Jason Rosenberg wrote on Facebook. 'If it’s not possible to be in our building, our hope will be to conduct services fully online. While this is never ideal, our experience since the Covid pandemic began has shown us that we can create a meaningful sacred time this way.' Rosenberg added that if Beth Am cannot hold services online, its members were invited to join a congregation in Charlotte, North Carolina, for its online services. He warned that it might not be possible to send email updates in the wake of the storm. Many other rabbis and their congregants in Milton’s path did evacuate over the past days, as warnings about Milton’s potentially unprecedented danger mounted. Some plan to broadcast or join Yom Kippur services from wherever they are; others are headed to local synagogues as guests for the holiday. Countless synagogues outside of the storm’s path offered shelter — and a seat in services — to evacuees looking for a new place to pray on Yom Kippur. Congregation Shaarei Kodesh in Boca Raton, in southeast Florida, was one of several congregations to advertise free seats on Yom Kippur for Jews fleeing the hurricane. 'The High Holy Days are a time for reflection, renewal, and coming together as a people,' the synagogue posted on Facebook, above a map of the hurricane’s path. 'In this moment, we are called to build a Sukkat Shalom — a shelter of peace — for one another. Whether it’s through offering a place to pray, a seat at the table, or simply the comfort of community, we strengthen our bonds and provide safety and support in the face of the storm, we are here for you.' The Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, always overlaps with the Jewish High Holiday season, meaning that disruptions because of major storms have always been a possibility in the region. Fort Myers was battered by Hurricane Helene just two weeks ago, and the storm caused even more destruction inland in western North Carolina, where flooding has crippled the city of Asheville. A synagogue there, Congregation Beth Israel, announced on Monday that it would hold Yom Kippur services now that power had been restored to the building — but not on Kol Nidre because of a curfew that remains in place, and in an abbreviated fashion because there is still no running water in the building. Portable toilets donated by Jewish Federations of North America, the synagogue wrote, 'will enable more of you to feel comfortable coming to services on Yom Kippur and subsequent Shabbats until water is restored.' In the days following Hurricane Helene, Jewish public officials have faced harassment and been the subject of antisemitic conspiracy theories that blamed them for the hurricane or for delays in the rollout of aid. Those theories were surging again on social media in advance of Milton — along with jokes noting that the hurricane’s name is often associated with old Jewish men. There is nothing funny about the situation for those preparing for Milton’s arrival. 'It’s not unlikely that there’s going to be areas that are going to be submerged,' said Joseph Dahan, a cofounder of Hatzalah South Florida, a Jewish-led emergency services organization. ' We hope that the high-water vehicles will be able to help in that situation. And then, if necessary, there may be a need to get into boats as well, depending on where that goes.' Expecting shortages of power and fuel, the group has been mobilizing its equipment and, Dahan said, preparing for the possibility of rescuing people. It is sending crews to areas predicted to be hit by Hurricane Milton, including a team of 15 on two ambulances headed to Orlando, which is not under an evacuation order. Rabbi Mendy Dubrowski of Chabad of South Tampa posted on Facebook that he was accepting requests for post-storm wellness checks and that he was in contact with emergency service providers staging outside the city. He said in a comment that his own family had left the area but remained nearby after a commenter wrote, 'This time you should evacuate. South Tampa is not the place to be.' For Minkowicz, staying at home during a hurricane is turning into something of a High Holiday tradition. In 2022, he and other area religious Jews were not aware of an evacuation order ahead of Hurricane Ian because it was broadcast during Rosh Hashanah, when traditionally observant Jews do not use electronics or communications devices. By the time they learned about the evacuation notice, it was too late to leave the area before the hurricane hit. About half of the 149 deaths attributed to Hurricane Ian took place in Lee County. In the wake of that hurricane, Minkowicz served a barbecue dinner to people who were facing blackouts and said at the time that he hoped to deliver hundreds of Shabbat dinners to local residents. 'Now it’s a matter of helping people get back on their feet, helping them fix up the houses, getting them food, getting them what to drink, getting them supplies,' Minkowicz said in 2022. 'That’s our next big job.' Now, over the past several days, his Chabad of Southwest Florida has been collecting propane, filling sandbags and organizing donations from people in other parts of Florida and beyond. He said that while much of Fort Myers was recently devastated by Hurricane Helene just two weeks ago, the Chabad house managed to withstand the previous storm. He is expecting about 30 to 40 people to shelter there who are unable to evacuate or need to be close to home. 'If you open the shul and the synagogue, so it gives them an opportunity to feel more safe, and they have someone to ride it out with and they can be with their whole family and be with spiritual support,' Minkowicz said.

Pro-Israel congressman’s office vandalized again	Espaillat, known for his vocal support of increased security funding for Jewish institutions and his defense of Jewish students facing harassment on college campuses, believes he was specifically targeted. By Jewish Breaking News Rep. Adriano Espaillat’s pro-Israel stance has made him a marked man in New York City. Early Tuesday morning, Espaillat’s office on West 181st Street was vandalized. According to police and the congressman, as many as four suspects used a hammer to bash the office’s front glass at 3am and scrawl 'FREE GAZA' in black on the sidewalk outside. 'My staff and I walked into a mess this morning,' Espaillat told the NY Post. 'Glass everywhere, paint dripping down the walls. It’s disheartening, to say the least.' Espaillat, known for his vocal support of increased security funding for Jewish institutions and his defense of Jewish students facing harassment on college campuses, believes he was specifically targeted. 'My name was on a flier listing protest sites for yesterday,' he explained. 'But instead of peaceful demonstration, we got this nighttime violence.' Despite the unsettling nature of the attacks, Espaillat remains resolute. 'We’re cleaning up and getting back to work,' he stated. 'Our constituents need us, and we won’t be intimidated.' This marks the second time that Espaillat’s Washington Heights office has been vandalized in less than a month, with the first coming in late September when vandals spray-painted 'F— Israel,' '40k dead,' 'genocide lover' and 'terrorist' in red paint on the windows and entrance. Both incidents are under investigation by the NYPD’s Hate Crime Task Force, but no arrests have been made so far. Meanwhile, a chorus of House representatives have risen to condemn the senseless hatred. Surprisingly, even anti-Israel squad members Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman joined the call. 'Over the past month, the office of Congressman Adriano Espaillat has been attacked and vandalized several times,' they said in a joint statement signed by 12 other Democrats. 'This targeted vandalism puts constituents and congressional staffers alike in harm’s way, disrupting congressional operations and social services that constituents depend on.' New York has seen its fair share of antisemitism post Oct. 7. Just yesterday, seven anti-Israel protesters were arrested at Manhattan demonstrations, including one man accused of kicking an NYPD captain in the chest.'

By Juda Honickman, Word Israel News Sid Rosenberg, the well-known host of *Sid and Friends in the Morning* on WABC in New York City, has returned to Israel for his second-ever visit, this time to commemorate the tragic events of October 7th. As a voice of solidarity for the Jewish state, Sid is not only retracing the steps of Israeli resilience but is also broadcasting his show live from the very locations that have shaped Israel’s modern history. On the first day of the trip, Sid broadcasted live from Sderot, a city on the Gaza border that has borne the brunt of many rocket attacks. In a powerful moment, Sid experienced his first *Red Alert*, the warning system signaling incoming rocket fire, forcing him and his team to take shelter in a bomb shelter. This reality check highlighted the daily threats that residents in southern Israel face. During this broadcast, Sid welcomed a special guest: former U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump spoke with Sid for about 30 minutes, discussing his support for Israel and sharing words of encouragement for the country in these difficult times. The second day of the trip brought Sid to Jerusalem, where he broadcasted live from the JNS Studios. His guest list included influential voices such as Scott Feltman, CEO of One Israel Fund, and David Friedman, former U.S. Ambassador to Israel, along with several other prominent figures. Each shared their insights on Israel’s challenges and the country’s unyielding spirit in the face of adversity. Sid also took time to tour Israel’s historic landscapes. He visited the Jordan Valley, seeing firsthand the Jordan River that is often referenced in the infamous phrase 'from the river to the sea.' On Tuesday, Sid visited Shiloh, the first Jewish capital of Israel, a site rich with the history of the Jewish people. Sid’s broadcasts continue to provide his audience with an intimate and personal glimpse into Israel's resilience and the deep connection between Israel and its supporters abroad. Sid’s trip stands as a reminder of the importance of standing with Israel, especially in the wake of the October 7th tragedy, a date that will forever mark a turning point in the nation's history.

Holocaust survivor Lily Ebert passes at 100	Ebert’s accounts on TikTok and other online platforms promoting Holocaust education have more than two million followers. By JNS Auschwitz survivor turned social media influencer and author Lily Ebert has died in London at the age of 100, her family announced on Wednesday. Ebert 'passed away of old age early this morning, at home surrounded by family,' the family said. She is survived by a daughter and a son, 10 grandchildren, 38 great-grandchildren and one great-great-grandson. Lily Ebert — 1923-2024. A light that shone so brightly has today gone dark. pic.twitter.com/A5bymeiFTG &mdash; Dov Forman (@DovForman) October 9, 2024 In July 1944, Ebert, aged 20, and her entire family were deported from Hungary to the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. Her mother, younger sister and brother were all murdered in the gas chambers. Four months after arriving at Auschwitz, Ebert and two of her sisters were transferred and put to work in a German munitions factory near Leipzig, where they remained until liberation by the U.S. Army in 1945. After World War II, Ebert moved with her surviving two sisters to Switzerland to rebuild her life. In 1953, she was reunited with her older brother, who also survived the Nazi persecution, and the family moved to Israel. In 1967, Lily and her husband immigrated to the United Kingdom. 'Lily’s story has touched hundreds of millions worldwide,' the family said on Wednesday. 'Her life-affirming intergenerational memoir, Lily’s Promise, co-authored with her great-grandson Dov Forman, is a reminder of the resilience of the human spirit and the dangers of unchecked hatred. Lily taught the power of tolerance and faith, the importance of speaking out, and the need to stand against prejudice.' In recent years, Ebert’s accounts on TikTok and other online platforms gained more than two million followers, which she used to educate about the horrors of the Holocaust and speak about her experiences. Scott Saunders, the chairman of March of the Living U.K., who also serves as its global CEO, stated: 'Her remarkable partnership with her great-grandson Dov Forman on social media, especially through their TikTok videos, reached younger generations and educated them about the horrors of Auschwitz and the strength of the human spirit. 'Ebert’s work has left an indelible mark on Holocaust education, and March of the Living will continue to carry her message of resilience and hope, passing the torch of memory and responsibility forward,' he said. In February, Ebert met with Kindertransport survivor Walter Bingham, who was born in Germany and lives in Jerusalem, at her London home on the heels of International Holocaust Remembrance Day. 'We have to live, every day, with the pain of what we went through,' Ebert explained at the time. 'We share that understanding, and it is for that reason that meeting the inspirational Walter was so special.'

Hezbollah rocket attack kills two in Kiryat Shmona	Around an hour earlier, Hezbollah fired some 40 rockets at the Upper Galilee and Haifa region, only some of which were intercepted, according to the Israel Defense Forces. By JNS Two people were killed on Wednesday afternoon when Hezbollah launched 20 rockets from Lebanon at the evacuated Israeli border town of Kiryat Shmona. According to the Magen David Adom emergency service, a man and woman, both around 40, were found in critical condition and unconscious. Both were shortly afterwards declared dead, said MDA CEO Eli Bin.

The Mideast war ‘has got to end,’ declares Kamala Harris	Speaking with comedian Stephen Colbert, Vice President Kamala Harris calls for ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas 'as immediate as possible,' says expanding Middle East conflict must end. By World Israel News Staff Vice President Kamala Harris called for an immediate halt to fighting in the Middle East, even as the war between Israel and Iran’s proxies continues to escalate with an expanding conflict in Lebanon and an anticipated Israeli reprisal against Iran following a recent ballistic missile attack. Speaking with comedian Stephen Colbert Tuesday night, Harris responded to a question regarding the Gaza war and repeated claims since December that a second ceasefire deal and hostage release were in the offing. Harris called for an end to the fighting 'as immediately as possible,' saying that the war between Israel, Hezbollah, Hamas, Iran, and Yemenite Houthis 'has got to end. It’s got to end.' 'We cannot lose some belief in its possibility. Because, to your point, we throw up our hands instead of rolling up our sleeves. But it is complex. It is a conversation that requires probably more time than you and I have right now.' The vice president noted that many of the issues essential to a truce and hostage deal have been worked out in negotiations, while admitting that without a deal such progress 'is meaningless.' 'Close means that a lot of the details have been worked out, but details remained,' Harris said. 'And so there has been some progress. But it is meaningless unless a deal is actually reached. So, I don't want to suggest to you that we should be applauded for getting close at times to a deal. The reality of it is that 1,200 people were massacred. There are still hostages being held in Gaza.' Harris mentioned her meetings with the families of Israeli hostages held captive in the Gaza Strip, and with relatives of Gazans killed in the ongoing war, saying that the U.S. must continue to pursue a permanent ceasefire in the coastal enclave. 'There is pain, pain and suffering that is happening in that region of the world, and we must work, and the United States must work and not lose hope and not throw up our hands around the role we must play in urging and seeking and building toward a resolution.' 'And the first thing that's going to unlock that is that we've got to get a deal done. We're not going to give up.'

6 wounded in Arab-Israeli terrorist rampage in coastal city	Armed civilians help stop terrorist stabbing attack and capture terrorist in Hadera. By World Israel News Staff At least six people were wounded, including two in critical condition, Wednesday morning, when an Israeli Arab terrorist brandishing an axe and a knife stabbed passersby at four different locations in the coastal city of Hadera. The attack took place just after 11:00 a.m. Wednesday when the terrorist wounded three people on Hagitit Street in Hadera, before attacking other passersby at several other locations on Yitzhak Ben Tzvi Street. Three armed civilians and a police officer confronted the terrorist, who attempted to flee the scene on a scooter. After shots were fired at the terrorist wounding him, the police officer, with the help of the armed civilians, managed to tackle and subdue the terrorist. Security personnel were deployed to the area and are conducting searches for any possible accomplices. Emergency first responders from Magen David Adom (MDA) and United Hatzalah were dispatched to the scene to treat the wounded and evacuate them to Hillel Yaffe Medical Center in Hadera. According to MDA, two of the victims, men in their 30s and 50s, are in critical condition, while three others, roughly 55, 60, and 70 respectively, were seriously wounded. The sixth victim is listed in moderate condition. 'We arrived at the scene where there was a seriously injured person with stab wounds in multiple areas of his body and suffered from multisystem trauma,' said MDA first responder Shaked Hajaj. 'He was semi-conscious; we provided lifesaving medical treatment and evacuated him to the hospital. After that, we returned to the scene to continue treating other injured individuals.' The wounded terrorist has been taken into custody and identified as Ahmad Jabareen, 36, an Israeli citizen and resident of the Arab city of Umm al-Fahm. Hadera Mayor Nir Ben Haim said Wednesday afternoon that Jabareen had used his scooter to move from one area to the next during his rampage.

Oct. 7 war ‘most covered event’ in Israeli history	The GPO has also organized almost 100 tours and events since the start of the war, as well as screenings of the film documenting the atrocities committed by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023. By JNS The ongoing Israel Defense Forces campaign against Iranian-backed terrorist organizations on the Jewish state’s southern and northern borders is the country’s most highly-covered war since 1948, the Government Press Office said on Tuesday. Since the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 cross-border massacre, Jerusalem has issued 5,530 press passes to reporters, photographers and other media personnel, the government agency declared in a statement. The GPO pass, much like those in other countries, facilitates journalists’ entry to closed press conferences, courts and other official institutions. 'The leading countries in sending journalists to cover the war are the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany, which together constitute almost 60% of the journalists,' said GPO Director Nitzan Chen. 'There were also countries that cover Israel less frequently, such as Romania, Ukraine, Argentina, Nepal and Singapore, that have sent journalists to Israel,' he added. 'The GPO will continue to be here for every challenge and every mission. We are committed to protecting the truth and telling Israel’s story, in every language, in every place and at any time,' said Chen. Almost a quarter of all reporters who arrived following the outbreak of the war came from the United States, with 1,221 new GPO cards issued, followed by the United Kingdom (985), France (647), Germany (314), Turkey (278), Japan (255), Italy (253), Spain (191), Canada (122) and Switzerland (101). The outlets that sent the most journalists were the British Broadcasting Corporation (425 GPO cards), NBC News (207), CNN (196), CBS (183), Italian broadcaster RAI (162 cards), Sky News (149) and Reuters (130). The GPO has also organized almost 100 tours and events since the start of the war, as well as screenings of the film documenting the atrocities committed by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023. Thousands of foreign journalists participated in the tours, the GPO stated, which mainly encompassed places like Sderot, the kibbutzim of Kfar Aza, Be’eri and Nir Oz, Netiv HaAsara and the site of the Nova festival. The GPO is situated in the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office alongside the country’s National Public Diplomacy Directorate.

Turkey’s president denounces Israel as a ‘Zionist terrorist organ...	Recep Tayyip Erdogan calls the state of Israel a 'terrorist organization,' hints that Turkey could confront the Jewish state, while castigating American lawmakers who applauded Netanyahu during his address to Congress. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Staff Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the State of Israel a terrorist organization Wednesday, and hinting at a possible future confrontation between Turkey and the Jewish state. Addressing a gathering of members of his Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in the Turkish parliament, Erdogan castigated Israel over its attacks on Iranian proxy groups, including the Hezbollah and Hamas terrorist groups. Erdogan warned that Israel's attacks on the two organizations, which began attacking Israel on October 8th and 7th, 2023 respectively, could lead to a wide-spread regional war. Denouncing Israel as a 'Zionist terrorist organization,' Erdogan reiterated his accusations that Jerusalem is plotting territorial encroachments against Turkey, a claim he made to the Turkish parliament Tuesday. 'After Lebanon, the next place on which Israel will set its eyes will be our homeland,' Erdogan told Turkish lawmakers Tuesday. Erdogan doubled down on the claim Wednesday, adding that Turkey was prepared to defend its territory and confront Israel. 'Turkey has the strength to burst their bubble. Israel's promised land delusion' will ultimately lead to great disappointment and defeat.' The Turkish president also condemned Western powers, accusing them of 'hypocrisy' vis-a-vis Israel and the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. Erdogan's government is working on 'exposing the hypocrisy in the West at every turn,' he said, taking aim in particular at American lawmakers who welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to a joint session of Congress in July. History 'never forgive those who applauded Netanyahu who has the blood of tens of thousands on his hands,' Erdogan said. Erdogan defended Palestinian terrorist groups including Hamas, calling its members 'freedom fighters' who are 'fighting for the honor of the Muslim world.'

Yazidi woman held in Gaza escapes – with Israel’s help	Fawzia Amin Sido had been sold by ISIS to a Hamas member who fought alongside them in Iraq and Syria. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News An Iraqi Yazidi woman held against her will in Gaza for four years escaped last week and is now home thanks to the efforts of a Canadian Jew who is known for rescuing Yazidis and the fact that IDF forces killed one of her captors. At age 11, Sido had been kidnapped and enslaved among thousands of other women and girls of her religio-ethnic minority by the Muslim extremist group ISIS when it took over the Sinjar region of Iraq in 2014. She spent several years of her captivity in Syria, she told CNN in an interview last week. That was where she was bought by a Hamas member who had fought alongside his fellow terrorists in their drive to establish a brutal caliphate throughout the Middle East. In 2020 he brought her to Gaza through Egypt using a fake Arab ID for his victim, who had been forced to have his children. Her family became aware that she was still alive in November when they saw a clip of her on TikTok that Kurdish news network Rudaw publicized. They contacted Steve Maman, who has become known in their persecuted community as the 'Jewish Schindler' for having managed to free some 140 Yazidis from captivity due to his contacts around the world. In an interview with i24News, Maman said that Sido had 'gathered her courage' to make and upload the video appealing for help after the brother of her 'owner' was killed in a battle with the IDF, and she wasn’t being watched so carefully. 'She was brutally beaten' after her captors’ family saw the news show, he said. In a separate interview, Maman told Ynet that it took months of work on two separate levels for the operation to succeed. First, there were months of behind-the-scenes political and diplomatic maneuvering with Iraqi, Israeli and American officials, although Iraq refused to work with Israel directly. For one, Maman said it took some hard work by both American and Israeli officials to obtain a temporary travel document for the Iraqi woman in lieu of a passport so that she could at the end enter Jordan through the Allenby crossing. They also worked with Sido herself. Maman said that for months his group 'trained her to make contact with the IDF, identify fences, and spot potential crossings.' At one point, he noted, his team made a direct attempt to extract her through a tunnel from Rafah into Egypt. Intermediaries offered to pay Hamas the $5,000 smuggling fee, he said, but 'just as we were close to executing the plan, Egypt tightened its border control with Gaza, making it very difficult to cross. The fighting intensified, and Israel moved into the area.' In commenting on the incident Thursday, the IDF stated, 'In a complex operation coordinated between Israel, the United States, and other international actors, [Sido] was recently rescued in a secret mission from the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom Crossing.' The Iraqis acknowledged the release without mentioning either Maman, Israel or even where Sido had been held, saying it had been accomplished 'via a joint effort with the international intelligence service.' 'It was the hardest rescue operation I’ve ever done,' Maman said, due to all the actors that needed to be involved. The businessman-cum-philanthropist also noted to i24 News that according to his sources, there are at least a few other Yazidi women in Gaza whom Hamas fighters and their families are holding against their will.

Israel’s soccer association responds to FIFA’s decision not to su...	The PFA submitted a proposal in May to sanction Israel and ban Israeli teams from all international soccer competitions due to the war in Gaza. By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner The Israel Football Association (IFA) has reacted to FIFA’s recent decision not to suspend the Israeli club and instead investigate the IFA over allegations of discrimination by the Palestinian Football Association (PFA), which is also calling for Israel’s suspension from international soccer matches. 'Whoever fantasized about the suspension of Israeli football from the international arena or sanctions through lies and false accusations, has suffered a defeat,' read a statement given to Fox News Digital by IFA head of communications Shlomi Barzell over the weekend. 'Again, we have acted over time in different channels, in a calculated and proactive manner in the face of the challenge of the Palestinian Association and its leader to distort reality, and the result today leaves no room for doubt.' 'We respect the authors of the report submitted to the council members and the decision of the council members to consider transferring two issues to a legal examination, as long as there is any factual justification for it,' the statement further noted. 'Thanks to values that represent a glorious democracy and an independent and determined legal system of the Football Association, we have never violated and will not violate any of the FIFA/UEFA rules.' FIFA, the world’s governing body for soccer, announced on Oct. 3 that its disciplinary committee will launch an investigation into claims by the PFA that the IFA is complicit in the Israeli government’s alleged violation of international law during the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The PFA also accused the IFA of discriminating against Arab players and including teams located in Palestinian territory in its leagues. 'The FIFA Disciplinary Committee will be mandated to initiate an investigation into the alleged offense of discrimination raised by the Palestine Football Association,' FIFA said in a statement. *'FIFA’s Governance, Audit, and Compliance Committee will be entrusted with the mission to investigate — and subsequently advise the FIFA Council on — the participation in Israeli competitions of Israeli football teams allegedly based in the territory of Palestine.' FIFA gave no timetable for when results of the investigation will be announced. 'The FIFA Council has implemented due diligence on this very sensitive matter and, based on a thorough assessment, we have followed the advice of the independent experts,' added FIFA President Gianni Infantino. 'The ongoing violence in the region confirms that, above all considerations, and as stated at the 74th FIFA Congress, we need peace. As we remain extremely shocked by what is happening, and our thoughts are with those who are suffering, we urge all parties to restore peace to the region with immediate effect.' The PFA submitted a proposal in May to sanction Israel and ban Israeli teams from all international soccer competitions due to the war in Gaza. The proposal cited 'international law violations committed by the Israeli occupation in Palestine, particularly in Gaza' and referenced FIFA statutory commitments on human rights and against discrimination. The proposal also accused the Israel Football Association (IFA) of 'providing moral, economic, and practical support to the occupation' of Palestinian territories. FIFA has repeatedly delayed making its final decision about the PFA proposal.

‘Not a thing that comes to mind’: Vowing new way forward, Harris ...	The co-hosts requested and received an extended explanation of what Harris was doing when Biden called her to tell her he was dropping out of the race. By Andrew Stiles and Thaleigha Rampersad, The Washington Free Beacon Vice President Kamala Harris continued her October media blitz on Tuesday, sitting down for a friendly chat with the ladies of The View. CNN media expert Brian Stelter predicted the female co-hosts would ask 'sharp questions.' They did not, obviously, but the softball nature of the interview did not stop Harris from providing a flawless soundbite for a future Donald Trump campaign ad. Having spent the last several months promising 'a new way forward' while pretending the Biden-Harris administration was not currently in power, Harris failed to identify a single thing she would have done differently compared to President Joe Biden. 'There is not a thing that comes to mind,' she said. 'And I've been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact.' That was Harris's second attempt at a response to co-host Sunny Hostin, who asked what the 'biggest specific difference' would be between a Biden presidency and a Harris presidency. Her initial answer was an inscrutable word salad about small businesses. 'Well, [Biden and I are] obviously two different people, and we have a lot of shared life experiences. For example, the way we feel about family and our parents and so on, but we're also different people, and I will bring those sensibilities to how I lead,' Harris said. 'I love our small businesses. My mother raised my sister and me predominantly, but we had what we called a second mother who lived two houses down who helped my mother raise us. She was a small business owner. I love our small businesses. And, um, and so the influence of a personal experience will have its impact on a presidency.' Later on in the interview, Harris offered a third response. 'You ask me what's the biggest difference between Biden and me? I'm going to have a Republican in my cabinet,' she said. Given the vice president's limited ability to speak without a script, perhaps the 'biggest difference' question could be considered a 'sharp' one. The other questions? Not so much. 'I personally cannot understand why anyone would vote for [Trump],' said Joy Behar, 82. 'A lot of it is, I think, is getting bad information—people are getting bad information from other channels. But do you have an explanation for this at all?' Harris proceeded to explain why Trump is bad. This elicited a series of cackles, affirmative grunts, and cheers from the audience, which pretty much sums up how the interview went. 'If, no, when you become president will you come back on The View?' Ana Navarro asked. (Of course she would.) The co-hosts requested and received an extended explanation of what Harris was doing when Biden called her to tell her he was dropping out of the race. 'I needed to talk to God,' she said. Harris was referring to her chat with longtime pastor Amos Brown, who in 2001 implied the United States brought the 9/11 terrorist attacks on itself by, among other things, declining to participate in a United Nations conference on racism. Politico previewed Harris's appearance on The View by noting it would be aimed at the 'sandwich generation' of middle-aged Americans struggling to support young children as well as aging parents. Hostin used this exact phrasing while prompting Harris to discuss her new policy proposal for a new taxpayer-funded health care benefit. It was almost as if the Harris campaign had scripted the entire exchange. Whoopi Goldberg signed on behalf of her fellow co-hosts and Harris supporters, telling the vice president: 'We're honored and proud to have you at this table.'

Eden Golan performs ‘October Rain’ in front of thousands at Oct. ...	After her two performances on Monday, Golan wrote about commemorating the Hamas terrorist attack in an Instagram post, saying, '10.7 will be a day we will never forget.' By Shiryn Ghermezian, The Algemeiner Eden Golan, Israel’s representative to the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest, performed her original song 'October Rain' at the United Nations headquarters and in New York City’s Central Park on Monday in two separate events commemorating the one-year anniversary of the deadly Hamas terrorist attacks in southern Israel that took place on Oct. 7, 2023. The song Golan performed at the UN memorial event and later at Central Park’s Summer Stage was initially written for this year’s Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo, Sweden. However, it was rejected by the European Broadcasting Union, which organizes the contest, for being too political since it references the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre. Golan instead competed in the Eurovision with a reworded version of the song, titled 'Hurricane,' and finished in fifth place in the international competition. Golan also performed Israel’s national anthem 'Hatikvah' at the UN memorial event, which was attended by hundreds of ambassadors, diplomats, pro-Israel activists, and family members of Hamas hostages as well as those murdered in the Hamas massacre on Oct. 7. The event was organized by the Israeli Mission to the UN in collaboration with Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which live streamed the event on social media. The ceremony’s speakers included US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Rabbi Doron Perez, whose son Daniel was murdered in the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas terrorists who still hold his body captive in the Gaza Strip, and Sigal Mansouri, whose daughters, Roya and Norel, were murdered at the Nova music festival. 'Our heart breaks for the victims, for the brave soldiers who gave their lives to defend us, for the families who have been torn apart and for the 101 innocent souls still held in the terror tunnels of Gaza,' said Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon. 'To the hostages and their families we say this: you are not forgotten. Every day, every moment, we carry you with us. We will never stop fighting for you until every last one of you is back home. Your names, your faces, your stories are forever etched into our hearts and we will make sure the world cannot look away.' The UJA-Federation of New York, Jewish Community Relations Council, and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum organized the community-wide gathering in Central Park on Monday night. The memorial ceremony was attended by hundreds of pro-Israel supporters and also elected officials from New York, including Gov. Kathy Hochul, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, US House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, US Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, state Attorney General Letitia James, and state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli. The event additionally featured a musical performance by Israeli singer-songwriter David Broza and student choirs, speeches by survivors of the Oct. 7 attacks, and a candle-lighting ceremony. After her two performances on Monday, Golan wrote about commemorating the Hamas terrorist attack in an Instagram post, saying, '10.7 will be a day we will never forget.' 'Yesterday, I [sic] had the honor to perform at the UN and later on at central park to share the pain we’ve experienced and continue to feel,' she wrote. 'Being a free nation has a stronger meaning today than ever, and I’m proud to stand in this room and in front of this crowd to sing my country’s national anthem.'

Syria: Seven killed in Israeli strike in Damascus	The upscale neighborhood where the attack occurred is home to the Iranian embassy, which tweeted that no Iranian citizens were killed in the strike. By JNS Syrian state media reported on Tuesday that an Israeli airstrike targeted a residential building in Damascus, killing seven people and wounding 11 others. The strike, in the Mazzeh district of the Syrian capital, also caused significant material damage, according to the Syrian Arab News Agency. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an organization associated with the Syrian opposition, reported that nine people were killed, including two non-Syrians. According to Ynet, the target of the strike was Haj Samer, a senior official in Hezbollah’s Unit 4400, responsible for transferring weapons to the terrorist group from Iran and its proxies. According to the Saudi state-owned Al Arabiya TV channel, the building that was struck was frequented by Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah officials. The upscale neighborhood where the attack occurred is home to the Iranian embassy, which tweeted that no Iranian citizens were killed in the strike. On April 1, Brig. Gen. Mohammad Zahedi, a top commander in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps’ Quds Force responsible for Syria and Lebanon, was killed in an alleged Israeli strike on a building adjacent to the Iranian embassy in Damascus. That attack prompted Iran’s first-ever direct strike on Israel a couple of weeks later. On Sept. 30, Syrian media reported that three people had been killed and nine wounded in Israeli airstrikes in Damascus. One of those killed was well-known Syrian TV journalist Safaa Ahmed, according to Syrian state television. Israel rarely admits to attacks on Syrian territory, although in February Jerusalem revealed that it had attacked more than 50 targets belonging to Hezbollah and other Iran-backed terror groups in Syria since Oct. 7.

‘Megalomaniac’ Sinwar demanding renewed suicide bombings of Israe...	After replacing Ismail Haniyeh as head of Hamas' politburo, Yahya Sinwar has reportedly demanded the terror group resume suicide bombings in Israeli cities, leading some in Hamas to denounce Sinwar as a 'megalomaniac.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Staff Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar has demanded the terror group resume its use of suicide bombings inside Israeli cities, leading some within Hamas to describe Sinwar as a 'megalomaniac,' The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. Sinwar, who has commanded Hamas forces in the Gaza Strip since 2017, also took control over the terrorist organization's politburo in August, following the assassination of his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, in a bombing in Tehran. According to Wednesday's report, immediately upon taking control of the politburo, Sinwar pushed for the resumption of large-scale suicide bombing attacks against Israeli cities, a tactic which fell into decline at the end of the Second Intifada in the mid 2000s. Days later, a Hamas terrorist died when a bomb he was carrying detonated prematurely in Tel Aviv. Citing a handwritten letter from last month attributed to Sinwar, the Journal wrote that the de facto Gaza ruler has prepared for a lengthy terror campaign to 'break Israel's will,' and ultimately destroy the Jewish state. Sinwar's behavior has led to concerns among other senior Hamas leaders, who reportedly have described him as a 'megalomaniac' who is too radical even for some in the fanatical Islamist Hamas. Arab intelligence officials who claim to be communicate 'regularly' with Sinwar told The Wall Street Journal that while prominent figures within Hamas fear Sinwar's plan may be too 'grandiose,' thus far none have openly defied his call for a new campaign of suicide bombings. According to Washington Institute senior fellow Matthew Levitt, who spoke with the Journal, Sinwar's ascension will likely mark a further radicalization of Hamas. 'Under Sinwar, Hamas can be expected to be a much clearer-cut, hard-line fundamentalist organization.'

Archeological find in Jerusalem sheds light on ancient Kingdom of...	2,700-year-old administrative center used by the Kingdom of Judah unearthed in Jerusalem, highlighting impact the Assyrian invasion had on the southern Jewish kingdom. By World Israel News Staff For the first time in Jerusalem, archeological excavation have found evidence showing the impact of the Biblical-era Assyrian king Sennacherib's military campaign on the economy of the Kingdom of Judah. During Israel Antiquities Authority excavations funded by the Israel Land Authority prior to the construction of the new Mordot Arnona neighborhood in the capital, revealed changes in the Judahite administration from the days of King Hezekiah in wake of the Assyrian military campaign and aftermath. Until now, evidence of the campaign which followed Judah's rebellion was known from the Judean Lowlands (Judean Shephelah). From the recent excavations, a picture emerges indicating that the original Judahite administrative structure that existed on this site was completely destroyed. 'We discovered remains of a significant royal administrative center from the days of King Hezekiah, and perhaps even from the reign of his father, King Ahaz,' say Neria Sapir, Natan Ben-Ari and Benyamin Storchan, excavation directors on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority. 'The center functioned in the last third of the 8th century BCE but was destroyed down to its foundations and buried under a massive heap of stones.' 'The stone pile formed a platform upon which subsequent structure was erected, holding a commanding view of all the agricultural areas to the east of the Armon Ha-Natziv – Ramat Raḥel ridge, and could be seen from afar. Large building stones originating from the early structure were deliberately incorporated into the heap.' 'We interpret these dramatic changes as a statement by the Assyrian imperial government, intended to convey a political-diplomatic message to the surrounding region and make it clear ‘who is really in charge’ by overhauling the administrative structure and its function.' 'As the Assyrians were still interested in the agricultural produce and taxes Judah could provide, they did allow for the existence of an independent Judahite administration, buy rather intensified its heavy economic demands.' The administrative activity of Judah included the concentration and management of the agricultural produce farmers used to pay taxes to the kingdom. The produce was transported and delivered in large ceramic storage jars – perhaps also stored here as a reserve for times of scarcity. In addition, wine, and possibly olive oil, were produced here in the Morodot Arnona neighborhood. Evidence of the changes in the Judahite administration after Sennacherib's military campaign found in Morodot Arnona include the discovery of an array of stamp impression jar handles. The long chronology of the seal assemblage portray Mordot Arnona's significance and continuity across changing administrative stages. Dating from the 8th century BCE onwards, dozens of 'lmlk' – '(belonging) to the king' stamp impressions were discovered here, as well as 17 handles with 'private' names written in Hebrew script. Among the names on the ‘private’ jar-handle stamps are Menachem Yubna (lmnḥm/ywbnh), Peqach Tavra (lṗqḥ/tbr’), Tzophen Azaryahu (ṣpn.ʿ/zryhw), and others. Who were these people? Were they the elite estate land owners who were the drivers of the kingdom's economy; or, were perhaps senior Judahite officials? The findings from Arnona, which will be published together with a team of researchers from Tel Aviv University led by Prof. Oded Lipschits, strengthen the hypothesis that the ‘private’ stamp impressions are part of a short-lived administrative system, operating prior to Sennacherib's military campaign – as part of the Kingdom of Judah’s preparations, led by King Hezekiah, to rebel against Assyria, at which time taxation to the Assyrian Empire ceased. From the beginning of the 7th century BCE onward, the lmlk stamp impressions differ from the earlier types and mark the return of Assyrian taxation in the aftermath of Sennaherib's campaign. According to the Minister of Heritage, Rabbi Amichai Eliyahu, 'It is very moving to encounter messages from high-ranking officials in the Judahite administration from some 2,700 years ago. The fascinating discovery by the Israel Antiquities Authority tells the millennia-long story of the Jewish people, who—despite crises and very difficult periods—have always known how to rise again, rebuild, and thrive.'

Israel hiding Iran retaliation plans, angering Biden: Report	Israel no longer seeking American permission ahead of significant war moves, as the Biden administration seeks regional calm ahead of the November presidential election. By World Israel News Staff Israel has yet to disclose its plans to retaliate for Iran's massive ballistic missile barrage last week, angering Biden administration officials who are desperate for regional calm ahead of the U.S. presidential elections next month, according to a Wall Street Journal report. President Joe Biden has repeatedly called on Israel to avoid striking Iran's nuclear facilities or oil assets, moves which would likely spark a serious counter-attack from Iran. However, Israel will not commit to refraining from hitting those targets, the Journal reported. In recent months, Israel made several significant military decisions, including assassinating Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, without seeking American permission beforehand. The report described a terse interaction between Defense Minister Yoav Gallant informed his American counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, after the Nasrallah strike. 'Excuse me, what did you say?' Austin reportedly said, following Gallant relaying that the Israeli Air Force had bombed Nasrallah's Beirut compound. Later, Austin asked Gallant if Jerusalem was prepared to defend itself 'alone,' as the U.S. was not informed in time to prepare defenses for Israel. On Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was said to have delayed Gallant's trip to Washington, where he was set to discuss Iran attack plans with Austin. Netanyahu is expected to speak directly with Biden on Wednesday, after weeks of silence between the two, a source told Reuters. 'We want to use the call to try and shape the limitations of the Israeli retaliation,' a U.S. official told Axios. According to the Axios report, the U.S. 'wants to make sure Israel attacks targets in Iran that are significant without being disproportionate.' Last week, Iran launched some 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, in what is believed to be one of the largest barrages of its kind in history. At least 25 of those missiles impacted in Israel, both in open areas and causing damage to some Israeli air force bases, an army spokesman said.

US secretly negotiating Israeli ceasefire with Iran: Report	The Biden administration and Arab countries are asking Iran to rein in its proxies, who are attacking Israel on multiple fronts. By World Israel News Staff The Biden administration and several Arab countries are currently engaged in talks with Iran, asking Tehran to rein in its proxy groups' multi-front attacks against Israel in exchange for a ceasefire agreement, according to a Channel 12 News report. The talks are aimed at seeing a ceasefire across multiple fronts, including Gaza and Lebanon, and for other Iranian-backed terror groups in the region, such as the Houthis in Yemen, to refrain from attacking Israel. Notably, Israel is not a party to the talks, though it has been made aware of the existence of the negotiations. An Israeli official told Channel 12 News that Jerusalem has yet to inform Washington regarding its stance on the discussions. 'We are currently in a position of power, a ceasefire will be on our terms, including a [Hezbollah] withdrawal beyond the Litani [River] and the dismantling of all military Hezbollah sites in areas near the border,' a senior Israeli official told the network. The report comes after prominent Hezbollah officials walked back their previous position that a ceasefire with Israel would require the withdrawal of IDF troops from the Gaza Strip. The terror group is now publicly expressing interest in a ceasefire that does not take Israeli military activity in the Strip into account, but is purely focused on Lebanon. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller noted in a press conference that Hezbollah's newfound openness to a ceasefire proposal demonstrated that the terror group had sustained serious damage. For a year, you had the world calling for this ceasefire, you had Hezbollah refusing to agree to one, and now that Hezbollah is on the back foot and is getting battered, suddenly they’ve changed their tune and want a ceasefire,' Miller said. However, Miller stressed that the Biden Administration 'ultimately wants a diplomatic solution to this conflict.'

Trump on hostage families: ‘Whatever I can do, I’ll do for them’	The former President was harshly critical of US President Joe Biden's policy on Iran, including the offer of $6 billion to the Islamic State as part of a prisoner swap. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Speaking to Ben Shapiro on his podcast at the Daily Wire, Donald Trump recounted meeting hostage families and saying, 'Whatever I can do, I'll do for them.' Trump recounted meeting the family of hostage Idan Alexander, an American citizen, during a ceremony commemorating the Hamas massacre on October 7th, a year on. 'They really don't know [if he is alive],' Trump said. 'It must be almost harder when they don't know; they're not sure whether or not he's alive or not alive. They think he is. But, you know, being alive over there is rough stuff. Before, it was rough, but now it's probably even rougher.' 'Whatever I can do, and you know this, whatever I can do, I'll do for them. Let's see what happens. Maybe I'll be able to help them. Hopefully, it's resolved long before that. But I can see the family is just going through hell. It is very, very sad to see,' Trump said. Regarding the Middle East in general, Trump discussed the success of the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and the UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, and Sudan. 'I did the Abraham Accords, which should have been filled in' with more Muslim countries, 'I would have had every one of the slots filled in. Biden got none. We had the four countries - four very good ones and four tough ones. The rest was just a fill-in job. We would have had total peace.' The former President was harshly critical of US President Joe Biden's policy on Iran, including the offer of $6 billion to the Islamic State as part of a prisoner swap. 'Iran was broke. We had no terrorism, we had no attacks, we had no Hamas problems, no Hezbollah problems. We had nothing, because Iran didn't have the money to give to them because I put sanctions on [Iran] and I dealt directly.' By the end of his term, Trump said Iran was 'Iran was ready to make a deal' by the end of his term,' Trump said. 'Biden should have made a deal. Iran was in a position [of weakness]. Instead, he gave them billions and billions of dollars. He took off the sanctions that I had. He took off everything, China started buying more oil than they ever bought before, and today Iran has $300 billion.' Following the October 7th terror attack, Biden faced strong criticism for the prisoner deal with Iran and the US agreed with Qatar not to release the $6 billion to Iran.

Hezbollah requests unconditional ceasefire	Qassem's statement implies that Hezbollah may be surrendering the demand for a ceasefire in Gaza as a precondition for a truce between Hezbollah and Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Naim Qassem, the most senior Hezbollah leader after the assassination of Nasrallah and his successor Safieddine, has called for an unconditional ceasefire, apparently not contingent on a cessation of fighting in Gaza. The former deputy to Hassan Nasrallah and member of Hezbollah's Jihad Council announced on Tuesday night that the terror group was 'agreeing to a ceasefire without preconditions. First, a ceasefire achieved through diplomatic means, and then we will discuss all the details.' Experts believe that the announcement was issued at the behest of Iran and was prompted by the terror proxy's military weakness after repeated Israeli strikes and assassinations of its leaders. Given that Qassem is the highest-ranking Hezbollah official remaining alive, the request for a ceasefire is apparently an official statement from the terror group. The request would entail both sides stopping the fighting before an agreement is mediated, most likely through the United Nations. Qassem added, 'If the enemy [Israel] continues its war, then the battlefield will decide.' He added that he relied on Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri to restore calm. 'We support the political activity being led by Berri under the title of a ceasefire,' Qassem said. The statement signals a change in position for Hezbollah since the terror group had indicated, since it began firing missiles into Israel on October 8th, that it would not stop hostilities until Israel submitted to a ceasefire agreement with Hamas in Gaza. Qassem's statement implies that Hezbollah may be surrendering the demand for a ceasefire in Gaza as a precondition for a truce between Hezbollah and Israel. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller explained that Israel has not yet accepted the ceasefire and that there is reason to distrust the request for a ceasefire from Hezbollah, particularly if the terror group refuses to retreat from Israel's northern border back to the Litani River, as it was supposed to do after the Second Lebanon War according to the terms of Resolution 1701. 'Obviously, we don't trust Hezbollah,' Miller said. 'But you look at what Hezbollah said in 2006 when the UN Security Council adopted 1701&#8230; that they would implement 1701 – and they blew through all of their commitments.' 'So there is an obvious lack of faith in Hezbollah's ability to do what it said in 2006 and do what it's saying it would do now, which is agree to an actual ceasefire that would allow Israeli civilians to return home and allow Lebanese civilians to return home,' the State Department spokesperson said. However, Miller said it was hopeful that Hezbollah had not spoken of a ceasefire in the 12 months of fighting and it was mentioning it now that the terror group is 'getting battered, suddenly they've changed their tune and want a ceasefire. I think it's not surprising given the situation they find themselves in,' he said.

Israeli strikes eliminated 6 Hezbollah commanders, 50 other terro...	During their operations in Lebanon, the IDF uncovered Hezbollah's plans to carry out an October 7th-style invasion of the northern border of Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel's military eliminated six senior Hezbollah commanders and 50 other terrorists through targeted strikes in Southern Lebanon on Monday. Israel's Air Force (IAF) was focused on targeting Hezbollah's southern Front, consisting of the Nasser Unit, Bader Unit, Aziz Unit, and the Radwan Forces. The Iran-backed terror group's strategy was to establish a Southern Front that would attack Israel above and underground. During their operations in Lebanon, the IDF uncovered Hezbollah's plans to carry out an October 7th-style invasion of the northern border of Israel. Monday's strikes were crucial in Israel's efforts to destroy this terrorist infrastructure and secure the border. The IAF carried out the strikes with precise guidance from the Intelligence Directorate in coordination with the Northern Command and Operations Directorate. In addition to eliminating terrorists, Israel's military destroyed a 25-meter tunnel that extended into Israel's territory. The six Hezbollah commanders who were killed in the strikes were identified as: Ahmad Hassan Nazal, head of the attack sector in Bint Jbeil for the Radwan Forces, Hussein Talal Kamal, head of the Ghajar sector, Musa Diab Barakat, outgoing head of the Ghajar sector, Mahmoud Mus Karnib, operations chief for the Ghajar sector, Ali Ahmad Ismail, artillery commander for the Bint Jbeil sector, and Abdullah Ali Dakik artillery commander for the Ghajar sector. Along with these 6 Hezbollah commanders, 44 other terrorists were eliminated. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed on Tuesday night that Israeli airstrikes killed Nasrallah's successor to head Hezbollah, Hashem Safieddine, who had been missing since October 3rd. During the address, Netanyahu urged Lebanese civilians to push out the Iran-controlled terror organization, Hezbollah, and to break their reins of control over Lebanon. 'We have degraded Hezbollah's capabilities; we took out thousands of terrorists, including [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah himself, and Nasrallah's replacement, and the replacement of his replacement,' Netanyahu stated. Safieddine, a maternal cousin of Nasrallah, was a cleric who wore a black turban, indicating direct descent from Mohammed. After a strike on Friday in Southern Beirut, Safieddine was assumed to have been severely injured in an area underground where it would have been difficult to escape alive. A Lebanese security official told Sky News Arabic that the chances of surviving such a strike were 'almost zero' and that Safieddine had been 'unreachable' since Friday.

Sid Rosenberg: ‘We’re going to win, because we just win’	The previous day, on the first anniversary itself, Rosenberg toured the communities in the southwestern Negev and visited the site of the Nova Music Festival. By John Hasten, JNS New York conservative talk-radio show host Sid Rosenberg is back in Israel this week—to show his solidarity on the first anniversary of Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 massacre. Before broadcasting his four-hour, top-rated show, 'Sid & Friends in the Morning,' to his 77 WABC audience, live from the Jerusalem studios of JNS, he reflected on the atrocities that sparked the Swords of Iron war against Hamas in Gaza. 'A year later, it still feels like yesterday,' he told JNS on Tuesday. 'What’s tough here is that the war is still going on. In fact, now, with the war raging in the north, and the situation in Judea and Samaria, it’s a lot worse than we thought. That being said, there is hope.' The previous day, on the one-year anniversary itself, Rosenberg toured the communities in the southwestern Negev, and visited the site of the Nova Music Festival where some 400 Israelis were murdered. He then traveled to Sderot to record his program, but minutes before the show was to air, his crew had to seek shelter from an incoming barrage of Hamas rockets. 'Driving south was intense yesterday,' he recounted. 'Passing kibbutzim and the site of the Nova festival, and seeing people crying on the side of the roads, probably the relatives of those killed on Oct. 7. And then we get to Sderot, and end up in a bomb shelter, and immediately experience the reality of what it’s like living here. And that was just the first two hours of our trip.' The show proceeded smoothly, however, with Rosenberg hosting his good friend, former President (and current presidential candidate) Donald Trump over the phone. 'President Trump was quick to remind everybody how much he did for the State of Israel,' Rosenberg said. 'No president did what he did. He moved the U.S. embassy [to Jerusalem], which is what Israelis wanted; recognized the Golan Heights as part of Israel; put together the Abraham Accords; and stopped delivering palates of cash to the Palestinians, which ended up in the hands of Hamas. When he was president, he got along great with [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu. They’re both strong leaders and they’ll get along great again. So, if I’m living in Israel, I almost want Trump to win as much as I do living in Queens, New York.' When asked about the anti-Israel protests that have taken place throughout the U.S., especially on college campuses, since the beginning of the war, Rosenberg said that while they are disturbing, he still believes the American people stand with Israel. 'It is disheartening that there are thousands of people who side with a group [Hamas] that commits rape, murder, torture,' he said. 'But I still believe in my heart of hearts that the majority of people in the U.S. stand with Israel.' Rosenberg added, 'I don’t believe we are losing that war in terms of sheer numbers. They are a very loud minority; that’s the problem. And the media love to cover them, so it seems that everybody in the U.S. is pro-Hamas. That’s not the case, but there is work to be done.' Rosenberg is adamant that the Israeli hostages still held by Hamas be freed or rescued, but he’s outraged at those screaming at the Israeli government to 'bring them home,' rather than demanding that Hamas 'let them go.' 'That’s complete nonsense,' said Rosenberg. 'If Bibi [Netanyahu] had the choice to bring them home, he would bring them home. He doesn’t have that choice. He doesn’t have the hostages; [Yahya] Sinwar and Hamas do. So, what should be said is ‘let them go,’ not ‘bring them home,’ which puts the onus on Bibi.' Rosenberg is confident that Israel will achieve victory on all fronts in the war. 'We’re going to win, because we just win,' he asserts. 'We’re like the [Miami] Dolphins in 1973; they never lost a football game that year. That’s the last undefeated team.' He added, 'Look what happened just a few weeks ago. What other country or military can figure out sending beepers and walkie-talkies [to Hezbollah] and blowing off their fingers and making them blind.' He elaborated, 'Our intelligence here in Israel is so far and away the best in the world. I understand we got caught flat-footed on Oct. 7, and maybe one day Bibi will pay a price for that, but since the war has started, there is nobody better. And even though we are outnumbered, we have the intelligence, the weaponry, the capability. We will win all these wars on all these fronts, I promise you that.' When asked to share a few last thoughts before sitting in the broadcaster’s chair, Rosenberg said, 'I had never been to Israel in 57 years, and now I’m back here for the second time in a matter of months thanks to the One Israel Fund [a pro-Israel non-profit organization that sponsored his trip], and I love it here. There is a spirit from the people that you just don’t find any place else. There is nothing like this country.' He concluded, 'Even what these people have gone through, they are going to smile the next day; they are going to be sincere and proud to be Jewish, alive and well. I really believe these are the best people in the world, here in Israel.'

Artless dodger: Harris flustered in substance-free 60 minutes int...	There's no telling how confounding Harris's answers must have been in real time. By Andrew Stiles and Thaleigha Rampersad, The Washington Free Beacon Vice President Kamala Harris went on 60 Minutes and attempted to answer some of the toughest questions she's faced—a low bar—since taking over the Democratic nomination from 81-year-old Joe Biden, who is technically still the president. She was meandering and evasive throughout the interview with Bill Whitaker of CBS News, who had to politely repeat the question on several occasions. There's no telling how confounding Harris's answers must have been in real time. The network's producers saw fit to liberally (and sloppily) edit the conversation. They included a considerable amount of overdubbed editorializing from Whitaker, as if he were translating Harris's remarks into basic English. They made clear at the outset that Harris's opponent, Donald Trump, declined to participate. 'Harris says she’ll press Congress to pass a federal ban on price-gouging for food and groceries, but details are yet to be defined,' Whitaker said in post-production remarks as Harris continued to ramble on screen at a low volume. He was attempting to translate Harris's answer to his question about rampant inflation during the Biden-Harris administration. 'We now have an economy that is thriving by all macroeconomic measures,' Harris bragged before struggling to articulate a plan that would help normal Americans who don't follow macroeconomic trends. 'Prices are still too high, and I know that. And we need to deal with it, which is why part of my plan—you mentioned groceries—part of my plan is what we must do to bring down the price of groceries.' Got that? At one point Whitaker interrupted Harris's talking points about how 'small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy' to insist she explain how she would pay for all her spending proposals. She said it could all be paid for by raising taxes on rich people and rejected Whitaker's suggestion that Congress was unlikely to approve new tax hikes. 'You know, when you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about because their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about,' the vice president alleged. 'I am a devout public servant, you know that. But I am also a capitalist.' Harris is also an alleged gun owner. 'I have a Glock, and I've had it for quite some time,' she told Whitaker. 'And, I mean, look. My background is in law enforcement, and, so there you go.' Of course she has fired it, the VP cackled, at a shooting range. Whitaker asked Harris a question many so-called journalists have had the opportunity to ask but for some reason have not: How does she explain her numerous reversals on the (radical left-wing) policy positions she espoused as a candidate in 2019? What was her message to critics who argued that 'people don't truly know' where she stands? Her answer failed to include an explanation or message beyond a saccharine appeal to common sense. 'I have been traveling our country, and I have been listening to folks, and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground,' Harris said before producers cut to a different clip, presumably out of mercy. 'I believe in building consensus. We are a diverse people, geographically, regionally, in terms of where we are in our backgrounds, and what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus, where we can figure out compromise, and understand it's not a bad thing, as long as you don't compromise your values, to find common sense solutions. And that has been my approach.' Alas, Whitaker declined to intervene or ask Harris what the hell she was talking about. 'I believe in my soul and heart, the American people are ready to turn the page,' said Harris, who has served as vice president since January 2021. Whitaker pointed this out while attempting to get Harris to explain why illegal immigration surged on her watch. 'Solutions are at hand,' she alleged. 'The policies that we have been proposing have been about fixing a problem not about promoting a problem, OK?' Harris was equally out of her depth when trying to discuss America's relationship with Israel and the threat of regional war in the Middle East. 'The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,' she said. 'The work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of, many things including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.' Harris was less artful when dodging Whitaker's question about whether as president she would support NATO membership for Ukraine. That was one of the 'issues that we will deal with.' Harris's befuddled running mate, Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, also took questions, including one about the criticism he's received for 'embellishing and telling outright falsehoods' about his military service and other aspects of his resume, including his whopper about being in China during the Tiananmen Square uprising in 1989. Walz's answer was only slightly better than the atrocious word salad he unleashed during last week's vice presidential debate against Republican J.D. Vance. 'I think folks know who I am, and I think they know the difference between someone expressing emotion, telling a story, getting a date wrong by a—rather than a pathological liar like Donald Trump,' Walz said. But could he be trusted to tell the truth? 'Yeah, well, I can. I think I can,' the governor shrugged. 'I will own up to being a knucklehead at times.' It's not yet known how many Americans tuned in to watch the interview. CBS News, by far the lowest-rated network in evening news, is still reeling from the backlash surrounding the VP debate, when moderators Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell pestered Vance with dubious 'fact checks.' On Tuesday, the network is holding an all-staff trauma training session with Dr. Donald Grant, a diversity and mental health consultant, after CBS executives denounced their own anchor, Tony Dokoupil, for challenging author Ta-Nehisi Coates's one-sided account of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Dr. Grant's social media posts include a blatantly racist image of Sen. Tim Scott (R., S.C.) alongside the caption 'Uncle Tim's Cabin,' a racially-charged term of disparagement.

US Treasury Department targets international charities, individua...	OFAC levied sanctions on the implicated actors, banning their organizations and transactions from operating in the United States and mandating their reporting to the agency. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner The US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has identified three individuals and one charity as having significant financial ties to the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. In a statement released on Monday, the one-year anniversary of Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre across southern Israel, OFAC announced new sanctions against the entities spotlighted by its investigation and noted they play integral roles in funding Hamas’s terrorism ventures under the guise of 'charitable work.' The department said that the investigation was part of its efforts to surface abuses by self-described 'charity organizations' really working to financially support terrorist groups. 'As we mark one year since Hamas’s brutal terrorist attack, Treasury will continue relentlessly degrading the ability of Hamas and other destabilizing Iranian proxies to finance their operations and carry out additional violent acts,' US Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said in a statement. 'The Treasury Department will use all available tools at our disposal to hold Hamas and its enablers accountable, including those who seek to exploit the situation to secure additional sources of revenue.' 'Treasury is committed to exposing terrorists and terrorist organizations that abuse the NPO sector. By publicly identifying a sham charity, this action reduces the overall risk of the NPO sector and helps preserve access by legitimate humanitarian organizations to financial services,' OFAC added in a statement. The Treasury Department identified Hamid Abdullah Hussein al Ahmar (al Ahmar), a Yemeni national living in Turkey, as an influential and prolific financier of Hamas. According the US government announcement, al Ahmar has served as the chairman of the Al-Quds International Foundation, a charity organization controlled by Hamas. In addition, OFAC identified nine entities controlled by Ahmar — Al Ahmar Trading Group, Al Ahmar Oils Supply and Distribution, Sama International Media, Al Salam Trading and Agencies General Establishment, Saba, Trade & Investment S.R.O, Sabafon International SAL, Sabaturk Dis Ticaret Anonim Sirketi, Vivid Enerji Yatirimlari Anonim Sirketi, Investrade Portfoy Yonetimi Anonim Sirketi — as potentially having ties to Hamas’s operations. The agency also flagged a cohort of Hamas funders based in European countries. Italy-based Hamas member Mohammad Hannoun runs the 'Charity Association of Solidarity with the Palestinian People,' according to OFAC, which said the so-called 'charity' actually operates as a fundraising effort for Hamas’s military wing. Hannoun has been designated by OFAC for 'having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services in support of, Hamas.' Germany-based Hamas member Majed al-Zeer helps spearhead the terrorist group’s European fundraising initiatives, OFAC claimed, adding that he has 'appeared publicly with other senior Hamas members in order to generate funding and other support for Hamas.' Adel Doughman leads Hamas’s Austrian activities and is 'one of the most prominent Hamas representatives in Europe,' according to OFAC. Doughman has also maintained high-ranking positions in Europe-based organizations that have allegedly funneled money to the terrorist group. Both Al-Zeer and Doughman 'are being designated for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Hamas,' OFAC wrote. OFAC also highlighted Hamas’s use of 'unlicenced' financial institutions such as Al-Intaj Bank to help facilitate their activities. The Hamas government in Gaza granted the alleged terrorist-supporting bank a 'permit' to operate in the Palestinian enclave. The bank 'provides financial services for Hamas despite not being connected to international banks,' OFAC said. OFAC levied sanctions on the implicated actors, banning their organizations and transactions from operating in the United States and mandating their reporting to the agency. 'As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above, and of any entities that are owned directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by them, individually, or with other blocked persons, that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC,' the agency wrote. In the year following Hamas’s Oct. 7 slaughter of 1,200 individuals in southern Israel, US federal agencies have identified a flood of terrorist-tied fundraising and information efforts on American soil. In July, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines warned that 'actors tied to Iran’s government' have encouraged and provided financial support to rampant protests opposing Israel’s war against Hamas. Iran has for years provided Hamas with weapons, funding, and training.

Three Hamas Oct. 7 perpetrators killed in Israeli strikes	The two operations were a joint effort of the Israel Defense Forces and Israel Security Agency and were carried out by the Israeli Air Force. By JNS Israel revealed on Tuesday that last week three Hamas terrorists who participated in the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre were killed in two separate airstrikes in the Gaza Strip. Mhuammad Rafa’i, a terrorist from Hamas’s Gaza Brigade who took part in the Oct. 7 attack in the areas of Kfar Aza and Nahal Oz, was killed in an attack on a Hamas command and control center embedded inside the Shuja’iyya school in Gaza City’s Daraj Tuffah district. Additionally, Rafa’i was involved in terror activities against IDF troops and Israeli civilians. Another strike, in Rafah on Oct. 1, killed Hamas terrorists Muhammad Zinon and Basel Ahras, who participated in the Oct. 7 massacre and plotted terror attacks against Israeli civilians. The two operations were a joint effort of the Israel Defense Forces and Israel Security Agency and were carried out by the Israeli Air Force. 'The IDF and the ISA will continue to operate against Hamas terrorists involved in the deadly Oct. 7 massacre,' the statement said. Twenty terrorists killed in Jabaliya area Meanwhile, Israeli forces continue to operate in Jabaliya in northern Gaza to root out a Hamas resurgence there, killing 20 terrorists over the past 24 hours. Troops also located a weapons storage facility and found weapons, including grenades and AK-47 rifles. במהלך היממה האחרונה כוחות אוגדה 162 חיסלו כ-20 מחבלים מהאוויר ובקרבות פנים אל פנים במרחב ג'באליה.כוחות צוות הקרב של חטיבה 401 השמידו מחסן אמצעי לחימה, ואיתרו אמצעי לחימה רבים ביניהם רימונים ונשקים מסוג 'קלאצ'ניקוב'>> pic.twitter.com/WTMfJPAXyC &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) October 8, 2024 In central Gaza, troops continued to dismantle terrorist infrastructure sites and eliminate terrorists in targeted raids.

Hezbollah launches over 100 rockets at Haifa as terror chief says...	Lebanese terrorists launch largest-yet barrage on northern Israeli city of Haifa, as Hezbollah's deputy chief declares the group remains combat effective despite major Israeli attacks on its leadership. By World Israel News Staff Hezbollah terrorists operating out of southern Lebanon launched over 100 rockets at the northern Israeli city of Haifa and its environs Tuesday afternoon in a pair of barrages, marking the largest attack on the city since October 7th, 2023. Sirens were sounded across the Haifa Bay area, Akko, and surrounding towns beginning at 12:11 p.m., with a second barrage detected at 12:43/ Most of the incoming projectiles were either intercepted by Israel's missile defense networks or landed in open spaces, the IDF said, though at least one rocket struck homes in Haifa, along with some damage reported in Kiryat Yam and Kiryat Motzkin outside of Haifa. One person, a woman in her 70s, was injured in Haifa after being struck by shrapnel, the Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency first responder organization said. The woman is listed in light-to-moderate condition. Amid the attacks Tuesday, Naim Qassem, the deputy chief of Hezbollah and de facto leader following the assassination of Hezbollah executive council chief Hassan Nasrallah last month and the apparent killing of his successor, Hashem Safieddine in an airstrike last Thursday, denied that the terror group's capabilities had been curtailed by Israel's attacks. 'You see that our daily accomplishments are great,' Qassem said on Iranian television. 'Hundreds of rockets and dozens of [drone attacks], a great number of [Israeli] settlements and cities have come under rocket fire.' 'I would like to reassure you that our capabilities are fine.' Despite the elimination of Hezbollah's chief and the disappearance and apparent killing of his successor, Qassem said the group had 'no vacant posts.' In an apparent nod to Safieddine's disappearance following an October 3rd Israeli airstrike in Beirut, Qassem said Hezbollah would soon appoint a new leader.

Nova survivor reveals she witnessed rape on Oct. 7 at Tel Aviv me...	We saw murder, kidnappings, but the hardest of them all was rape,' she said. 'I have never heard screams for help like the ones I heard from that woman.' By Deborah Danan, JTA As the sun dipped over Tel Aviv’s Yarkon Park and families of Hamas’ victims and hostages began trickling in for an Oct. 7 memorial, a siren blared, warning of a missile fired from Yemen that forced everyone to the ground, their hands shielding their heads. It was a stark reminder that the war begun a year ago was far from over. The event — organized as a counterpoint to the official state-led ceremony, which many of the grieving families boycotted — was supposed to be much larger. The 50,000 tickets allotted for the event were reserved within hours of their release, but due to wartime restrictions on large gatherings, attendance was limited to press and victims’ families. The scaled-back audience — and a larger crowd viewing from all over the world by livestream — heard musical performances from a host of celebrities, political outrage from families who feel abandoned by Israel’s government and chilling testimony from Oct. 7 survivors. In a video broadcast at the event, Yuval Sharvit Trabelsi, who survived the Nova massacre but lost her husband Mor there, revealed for the the first time that she witnessed rape while trying to evade Hamas terrorists. 'We saw murder, kidnappings, but the hardest of them all was rape,' she said. 'I have never heard screams for help like the ones I heard from that woman.' She went on to recount how she smeared herself with her husband’s blood so that the terrorists would think she was dead. In all, more than 360 people were killed at the Nova festival. As on Oct. 7 last year, a Hamas-fired rocket had triggered sirens in Tel Aviv earlier in the day, a sign that the terror group still poses a danger after a yearlong campaign by the Israeli military to eliminate it. But Linda Trabelsi, Mor’s mother, said the threat of rockets didn’t deter her from attending the memorial service. 'Not coming wasn’t an option,' she told JTA. But she said the anniversary was not her hardest day. 'No, Oct. 7, 2023, was the hardest day,' she said. 'And after that? Every day since.' But she noted that September had been especially difficult, as it included both Mor’s birthday and what would have been his first wedding anniversary. Many families of victims and hostages blame the government for failing to prevent the Hamas attack, when thousands of terrorists stormed Israel’s southern border en masse, killing some 1,200 people, abducting more than 250 to Gaza and perpetrating the worst one-day attack in Israel’s history. And in the year since the attack, many hostage families say the government could have — and should have — done more to secure their freedom. 'Instead of standing here in multitudes as a united people of Israel, we wait for the next siren,' said co-organizer Yonatan Shamriz, the brother of Alon Shamriz, who was taken captive and later killed by Israeli soldiers in a case of mistaken identity. 'Instead of a state investigative commission being formed to investigate this colossal failure, we are left asking the questions ourselves, without getting any answers,' he said. 'There is no personal example, no vision, no leadership, no accountability.' Shamriz’s anger was reflected in the split-screen reality of the day: In contrast to the Tel Aviv event, the official state ceremony was prerecorded weeks ago and featured speeches by the leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom the hostage families blame for not rescuing their loved ones from the tunnels of Gaza. There is broad Israeli support for an intensified effort to release the hostages. A survey released on Monday by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 62% of Israelis said freeing the captives should be the main goal of the war, and most said the war in Gaza should be ended, in part to avoid endangering the hostages’ lives. But Netanyahu focused his speech on defeating Hamas, which he listed first among the war’s aims, and vowed to continue the fight. 'We mustn’t stop the war prematurely,' he said. 'As long as the enemy threatens our existence and the peace of our country, we will continue to fight. As long as our hostages are still in Gaza, we will continue to fight. We will not forsake any of them. I will not give up. As long as our citizens have not returned to their homes safely, we will continue to fight.' Doron Weiss, who attended the Tel Aviv memorial in honor of his nephew, captive soldier Matan Angrest, also voiced anger at Israel’s leadership. Last month, his sister, Anat Angrest, played a recently unearthed audio clip of her son speaking from Gaza — the first sign of life since his abduction. 'I’m finished with tears. We’ve been living this hell for a year. We know our leaders are not doing everything they can to release them, and it stings,' Weiss told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. Several Jewish communal leaders also attended the Tel Aviv event, including William Daroff, CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, and Eric Fingerhut, president and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America. Daroff, who was leading a solidarity mission, focused his rebuke not on Netanyahu but on Israel’s allies in the wake of the attack. 'Our allies weren’t there standing with us at the end of the day. As Jews we can only really count on Jews,' he said. 'When Israel bleeds, American Jews bleed and when Israel cries American Jews cry. That’s become a standard since Oct. 7.' British-Israeli Gaby Young Shalev, whose brother Nathanel Young, a soldier, was killed in action on Oct. 7, said today was the 'first day it really hit' her. She described the months following her brother’s murder as a whirlwind of otherwise happy life events, including her parents’ aliyah, two of her siblings giving birth, and the arrival of her own twins. 'And even though we speak about Nat every day, talking about projects and ways we can commemorate him, it’s almost like a distraction from the truth,' she said. 'Then, at these kinds of events, when people send messages and send their support, you kind of realize this is actually real. It makes you realize the extent of it, and the fact that there are thousands of other families going through the same thing is just even more tragic.' She added, 'Every time I see another fallen soldier’s name, it’s hard, knowing more families are going to go through the same cycle. Especially when they’ve served quietly in Gaza for months, only to fall after all that.' Yigal Cohen took to the stage and recounted how his daughter, a surveillance soldier at the Nahal Oz base, was 'murdered barefoot, in her pajamas.' 'The blood of our daughters cries out to us from the earth. We cannot be silent. We will not leave, we will not forget, and we will not grow weary,' he said. At the conclusion of his speech, in a symbolic gesture calling for the release of the five surveillance soldiers still held captive in Gaza, he released five yellow balloons into the air. A common refrain from Israelis — and especially hostage families — is that they are still living the hell of last Oct. 7. One year later, that anguish that was evident at the ceremony in Tel Aviv. 'Tal’s children, Neve and Yahel, keep asking: Where’s Dad? When will he come back? When Dad comes back, will he be very old?' said Nitza Korngold, mother of hostage Tal Shoham. 'In which country are these the questions a 9-year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl ask?'

Britain’s prime minister rejects call for broad arms embargo on I...	A wrong position' - PM Keir Starmer shoots down proposed ban on all arms sales to Israel, even after his government suspended dozens of contracts with Israel. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The United Kingdom will not impose a sweeping arms embargo on Israel, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer declared Monday on the first anniversary of the Hamas invasion of Israel. After addressing Members of Parliament on Monday, Starmer fielded questions from lawmakers, including one posed by Coventry South's representative, MP Zarah Sultana. Sultana, a member of the Labour Party who is in the midst of a six-month suspension, claimed that over 118,000 people have died in the Gaza war thus far - nearly triple the figure claimed by Hamas' own health ministry - and asked Starmer whether he would back a comprehensive ban on arms sales to Israel. 'In light of Israel's genocidal assault in Gaza, the violence in the West Bank, and the invasion of Lebanon, I ask the prime minister if he believes Israel's right to self-defense justifies a death toll - which according to research by medical professionals in the U.S. who have worked in Gaza has now surpassed 118,000 as well as the 2,000 people killed in Lebanon - will he do what is morally and legally right and end the government's complicity in war crimes by banning arms sales to Israel, including F-35 fighter jets, not just 30 licenses, yes or no?' Starmer's government has already suspended 30 arms contracts with Israel, Foreign Secretary David Lammy revealed last month, while some 320 contracts remain in place. Responding to Sultana's question, Starmer said: 'No.' 'But it is a really serious point. Banning all sales would mean none for defensive purposes.' 'None for defensive purposes on the anniversary of October 7 and days after a huge attack by Iran into Israel would be a wrong position for this government and I will not take it,' Starmer continued.

Israel has ‘one-time opportunity’ to smash Iran’s nuclear sites	Former prime minister Naftali Bennett says Israel must act now and strike Iran's nuclear facilities. By World Israel News Staff Former prime minister Naftali Bennett urged the Israeli government to defy pressure from the Biden Administration and launch a devasting attack on Iran's nuclear assets. Israel has yet to respond to a direct attack from Iran last week, which saw the Islamic Republic launch some 200 ballistic missiles targeting sites in Israel in what is believed to be one of the largest attacks of its kind in history. 'President Biden has said that Israel can retaliate against Iran, but must keep the response 'proportionate'. The president also urged Israel not to attack Iran’s nuclear program,' Bennett wrote on social media platform X. 'Now that the main proxies of Iran's terror, Hezbollah and Hamas, are weakened Israel finally has an opportunity to strike Iran's nuclear program,' Bennet said. 'This is a one-time opportunity, and we cannot miss it,' he continued. 'This will take some time, but this week’s response must start this process,' he added. 'If we don’t take out the nuclear program now, I don’t know we’ll ever do it. The mullah regime has acquired SQ10, which means enough high grade uranium to produce 10 nuclear bombs. The regime is racing towards producing the detonator device itself, while the world can no longer really track this,' he warned. In recent years, Iran has barred international inspectors from its nuclear sites. Although the Iranian government claims its nuclear program is strictly for civilian purposes, it has begun stepping up enrichment of uranium. Watchdog groups have warned that Iran likely has the capabilities to create enough enriched uranium for at least one nuclear-grade weapon within a week's time. 'We might wake up to a test bomb exploding in Iran’s desert. At that moment the Middle East will become a nuclear nightmare. We have the justification and the ability. It’s time to act now,' Bennett added.

Hezbollah’s logistics chief killed in Israeli airstrike	The logistics headquarters which Husseini led was in charge of the terror group’s budgeting and management of various units. By Pesach Benson, TPS Hezbollah’s logistics chief, Suhail Hussein Husseini, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in the Beirut area, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed on Tuesday morning. 'Husseini played a crucial role in weapon transfers between Iran and Hezbollah and was responsible for distributing the advanced weaponry among Hezbollah’s units, overseeing both the transportation and allocation of these arms. Additionally, he was a member of the Jihad council, Hezbollah’s senior military leadership council,' the IDF said. The logistics headquarters which Husseini led was in charge of the terror group’s budgeting and management of various units. The headquarters also included Hezbollah’s Research and Development Unit, which is responsible for manufacturing precision-guided missiles and managing the storage and transportation of weapons in Lebanon. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, the Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities, killing 49 people. According to figures released by the government on Sept. 29, more than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. Israel’s war goals include securely returning northern residents to their homes. Israeli officials demand Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from southern Lebanon in compliance with UN Security Council resolution 1701 which ended the Second Lebanon War of 2006. This includes all areas south of the Litani River such as the cities of Nabatieh and Tyre, as well as the Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.

‘They can never defeat us’: Jewish students commemorate Oct. 7 vi...	It still feels like Oct. 8, because we’re still missing our loved ones,' GW Chabad president Sabrina Soffer said during an interview on Monday. By Dion J. Pierre, The Algemeiner Jewish students at George Washington University in Washington, DC came together on Saturday to commemorate the lives of the kidnapped and deceased ahead of the one-year anniversary of Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre across southern Israel, a tragedy which claimed more Jewish lives in one day than any since the Holocaust. Organized by Chabad GW, the event — titled 'Remember, Resolve, Rededicate' — was held at Kogan Plaza, a section of campus that has seen both memorials to the victims of Hamas’s barbarism and celebrations of their afflictions led by pro-Hamas activists. On Saturday, however, a generation of Jewish students whose lives and conceptions of self have been upended by the events of the past year claimed the space as exclusively theirs, transforming it into a realm of healing and perseverance. Speaking to The Algemeiner on Monday, several students who attended the gathering remarked on the swiftness of the passage of time and why, one year removed from Oct. 7, it still feels like only the day after. 'It still feels like Oct. 8, because we’re still missing our loves ones,' GW Chabad president Sabrina Soffer said during an interview on Monday. 'Israel is such a small country, and there, everyone is like family. We’re still missing over 100 people; we’ve lost so many, people are displaced from their homes — and the war is still ongoing and only escalating from here. I just hope that Israel will achieve victory. I want the war to end, but Israel must win.' The presence at the vigil of those seemingly hostile to those gathered in support of Israel and the Jewish community also shrunk the distance between one year ago and now. At one point, a young woman wearing a keffiyeh roamed through the crowd, taking pictures of the students as they listened to speeches and comforted one another. She did not disclose what the pictures were for nor which media outlet she represented. 'It was an amazing visualization, the more I think about it,' freshman Nate Neutstadt told The Algemeiner. 'We’re here together as a community celebrating life, celebrating love, and on the other hand, there were people coming up to us trying to fuel the fire and spread hate.' A native of San Diego, California, Neutstadt chose to attend GW — which he described as his 'dream school' for its highly reputed school of international affairs — fully aware that every day on campus would see his Jewish identity scrutinized and maligned. Resisting any notion that Jewish identity can be driven underground, he accepted the challenge. The unknown woman was one of many obstacles against which he, as well as other first-year Jewish students, had steeled themselves long ago. Soon, she became an afterthought. No one photographed her in return. 'We were all just here in the moment, celebrating. And I think all of our mindsets at this point is that they’re going to do what they’re going to do and we’re going to be here celebrating life and love,' he added, explaining that he intends to fight hatred with Jewish pride. 'There’s so much hate going around towards Jews just over our existing, and I think the best way to fight against it is to be a proud Jew, to live Jewish life in the face of hate. Because no matter what these antisemites try to do, chanting in the streets ‘intifada, intifada,’ they can never defeat us.' Others, such as senior Ari Shapiro, have experienced an awakening of Jewish identity in the post-Oct 7. world. Throughout most of his life, Shapiro explained, Jewishness was an overlooked component of his identity, a detail of his biography which entitled him to a bar mitzvah but was attenuated by the comfort and banality of suburbia. 'I’m in a different boat than some of the others Jewish students you’ll talk to,' he said. 'Before Oct. 7, 2023, I had never really considered what it meant to be Jewish. I never really felt an attachment to the identity or had even considered it to be a barrier between me and anyone else who wasn’t Jewish. That’s ironic, I know, given my name, which doesn’t get more Jewish than that. But seeing how Hamas butchered and slaughtered thousands of people, many of whom were part of the kibbutzim, which is usually the farther left group in Israel; and then seeing people on this campus demonstrate in support of their killers — that forced me to realize that no matter how much I made being Jewish as part of my identity, I would still share in the fate of others whose Judaism and Jewishness is the basis of how they are perceived by the world.' For Natasha Halbfinger, who lived in Israel for four years during adolescence, Oct. 7 affirmed values in which she has always believed. 'We, as the Jewish people, will continue to be proud of our identities,' she proclaimed during a speech delivered on Saturday night. 'We will not be Jews with trembling knees. We will continue to turn horror into beautiful celebrations of life — because Am Israel Chai.

CIA head: Israel’s ‘misjudgment’ could spark regional war	CIA director appears to claim that Israel responding to Iranian attack could trigger widespread escalation in the ongoing Middle East conflict. By World Israel News Staff The head of the Central Intelligence Agency said that despite an international push for calm, the prospect of a widespread regional war in the Middle East remains a looming threat. CIA director Bill Burns appeared to shift the onus of responsibility for the potential worsening of the war on Israel, saying that Jerusalem must respond cautiously to Iran's recent ballistic missile attack. 'We face the very real danger of a further regional escalation of conflict,' Burns said at the Cipher Brief Annual Threat Conference in Georgia on Monday. 'The Middle East is a place where complicated stuff happens all the time,' he continued. Burns said he believed that Israel's leadership was 'weighing very carefully' potential responses to Iran's unprecedented attack, which marked the second time in 2024 that Tehran directly attacked the Jewish State. But, Burns said, 'misjudgments' on the part of Israel could trigger an escalation of the conference. During his remarks, Burns did not include the context that Iranian proxy groups, including the Lebanon-based Hezbollah terror group and the Houthis in Yemen, have repeatedly attacked Israel across multiple fronts in the past year. The CIA head also downplayed the Iranian nuclear threat, claiming that 'we do not see evidence today that the Supreme Leader has reversed the decision that he took at the end of 2003 to suspend the weaponization program.' Burns then admitted that Iran had stepped up is uranium enrichment, and could potentially create enough of the material for a nuclear bomb within a week's time. In recent months, the Biden administration has attempted to rein in Israel's military campaign against Hezbollah and other terror groups, likely due to concerns of the war escalating before the November presidential elections in the U.S. Analysts have noted that Washington appears to have waning influence on Jerusalem, as decisions such as the assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah were made without the U.S. being informed prior to the strike.

Freed by US, Russian arms dealer selling guns to Houthis	The Biden administration is concerned Moscow might arm the Houthis with such weapons in retaliation for U.S. support for Ukraine. By JNS Viktor Bout, aka the 'Merchant of Death,' a Russian arms dealer who spent 12 years in a U.S. prison before his release almost two years ago, is back brokering weapons sales, this time to Yemen’s Houthis. Bout, who reportedly inspired the 2005 Hollywood movie, 'Lord of War,' starring Nicolas Cage, was released 13 years short of his 25-year sentence for conspiracy to kill American citizens and officials, delivery of anti-aircraft missiles, and providing aid to a terrorist organization, in a one-to-one prisoner exchange for Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) star Brittney Griner on Dec. 8, 2022. After his release, Bout, 57, known for his distinctive moustache, won a local seat in a regional parliament for a pro-Kremlin, far-right party in 2023, suggesting a new career path in politics. But when Houthi emissaries came to Moscow in August to purchase $10 million in small arms, it was Bout sitting across the table, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing a European security official and others. The Houthis came under the pretense of buying pesticides and vehicles, visiting a factory of Lada, a state-owned manufacturer of small vehicles, sources said. On Jan. 17, the U.S. announced it would redesignate the Houthis a terrorist group after having lifted the Iranian proxy’s terrorist designation on Feb. 16, 2021. The Houthis have wreaked havoc with international shipping, targeting vessels passing off Yemen’s Red Sea coast. They have also joined the battle against Israel, firing drones and missiles at the Jewish state. Israel has twice retaliated. An escalation for Russia Sources who spoke to the paper didn’t know if the deal came at the Kremlin’s request or simply with its tacit approval. 'The first two deliveries will be mostly AK-74s, an upgraded version of the AK-47 assault rifle,' the Journal reported. The small arms have not yet been delivered, and while they fall short of the more advanced anti-ship or anti-aircraft missiles that could threaten the U.S. military, the sales would 'mark an escalation' for Russia, the paper noted. The Biden administration is concerned Moscow might arm the Houthis with such weapons in retaliation for U.S. support for Ukraine. According to sources, 'during the trip, Houthi representatives also discussed other weapons the Russian side might potentially sell, including Kornet antitank missiles and antiaircraft weapons.' Steve Zissou, the U.S. attorney who represented Bout, said that 'if the Russian government authorized him to facilitate the transfer of arms to one of America’s adversaries, it would be no different than the U.S. government sending arms and weapons of mass destruction to one of Russia’s adversaries as it has sent to Ukraine.' After the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991, Bout bought Russian military cargo planes and transported U.N. peacekeepers in Africa. But in 2005, the U.S. sanctioned him for trading weapons for diamonds with former Liberian president Charles Taylor. The U.N. accused Bout of 'violating international arms embargoes on Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo,' the Journal reported. U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents posing as Colombian leftist rebels arrested Bout in Thailand in 2008. He was sentenced in 2011 for conspiring to kill Americans and trying to sell arms to Colombian rebels. When Bout was released in the prisoner swap, the White House said it was the only way to get Griner out of a Russian penal colony. At the time of his release, National Security advisor Jake Sullivan said the U.S. government concluded that the risks associated with Bout’s release were acceptable. 'We believe we can manage those challenges, but we will remain constantly vigilant against any threat that Viktor Bout may pose to Americans, to the United States going forward,' Sullivan said. 'I would just point out that there is no shortage of arms traffickers and mercenaries in Russia,' he said.

Israel won’t hit Iranian nuclear facilities – report	Israeli officials told The New York Times that retaliation for last week’s missile attack may target military, intelligence or leadership sites. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel is not expected to hit Iranian nuclear facilities in retaliation for last week’s attack in which Tehran fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles at the Jewish state with negligible results, The New York Times reported Monday. Citing unnamed 'former and current senior Israeli officials,' the paper said it is 'likely' that Israel would instead go for military, intelligence or leadership sites. The most strategic targets, Iran’s nuclear production plants, which experts agree are only weeks away from manufacturing a bomb if the order to do so is given, 'seem to have been reserved for later,' the paper said, if the mullahs decide to escalate after the upcoming Israeli response plays out. The Israeli officials also expressed doubt over whether Israel could seriously damage such crucial locations as the centrifuge plants that have been enriching uranium to near weapons-level in recent years. These are dug deep into mountains or underground and the U.S. has consistently refused to sell Jerusalem its heaviest bombs, which are the only weapons considered capable of destroying such reinforced sites. Israeli right-wingers have called Iran’s direct attack, which theoretically could have killed thousands and caused immense damage, an act of war that demands serious action. Former prime minister Naftali Bennett wrote on X immediately after the missile strike, 'Israel has now its greatest opportunity in 50 years, to change the face of the Middle East&#8230;.We must act *now* to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, its central energy facilities, and to fatally cripple this terrorist regime&#8230;. We must remove this terrible threat to our children's future.' Israel’s allies, however, are not on board, fearing that such a move would lead to an explosion in the region that could drag them in as well. Speaking after a virtual meeting with representatives of the other G7 countries U.S. President Joe Biden had said Wednesday in response to a question on the subject that he would not support such a strike. 'The answer is no,' the president said. 'All seven of us agree that [Israelis] have a right to respond, but they should respond in proportion.' The White House statement following the meeting said the seven economic leaders of the world had condemned the Iranian ballistic missile attack as 'unacceptable' and that they would coordinate a response 'including new sanctions.' Stricter implementation of existing sanctions was also something 'we are looking at right now,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a subsequent briefing. Iran’s oil facilities, which are also a high-potential target for an Israeli airstrike, being Tehran’s main economic lifeline, could be hit this way instead. While much of Iran’s oil sales go to China, which is not tied to the American financial system that bars the Islamic Republic from using it, independent research firm ClearView Energy Partners said in an October 1 note that about a quarter of Iran’s crude production could potentially be choked off by more vigorous sanctions enforcement.

Trump visits Lubavitcher rebbe’s grave, vows to make Israel ‘very...	Speaking at memorial marking anniversary of October 7th atrocities, former President Donald Trump says next month's presidential election will be the 'most important day in Israel's history.' By David Rosenberg, World Israel News This November's American presidential election will have a massive impact in determining Israel's future, former President and 2024 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Monday. Speaking at a memorial marking the first anniversary of the October 7th invasion, Trump said election day next month would be 'most important day' ever in the history of the State of Israel. 'You know, I say that November 5 will be the most important day in the history of our country,' the former president said. 'I think it will also be the most important day in the history of Israel. If you want to know the truth, I believe that. I think you believe that, too.' Held at the Trump National Doral Miami, the event came on the heels of the former president's visit to Queens, New York, during which Trump prayed at the resting place of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe. Rabbi Abba Refson, administrator of the site, hosted Trump, who prayed at the grave before flying to Miami for Monday evening's memorial event. Trump was joined at the Rebbe's grave by Yael, Adi, and Roy Alexander, the parents and brother of Gaza hostage Edan Alexander, along with Auschwitz survivor Jerry Wartski. Businesswoman and Republican donor Miriam Adelson introduced Trump at the Miami gathering, telling attendees that the October 7th invasion and subsequent attacks by other Iranian proxies would not have occurred had Trump been in office last year. 'Hamas would not have dared, Hezbollah would not have dared, the Houthis would not have dared, and yes, the Ayatollah of Iran would never have dared because even they understand when they are faced with real courage, they can spot a strong leader who will make their lives hell if they get out of line.' Trump said that if elected, he would ensure the U.S.-Israel alliance would be 'stronger and closer than it ever was before,' and vowed to bring peace to the Middle East. 'We were strong, we were powerful. We were respected like this country has not been respected in many, many decades, just four years ago. That's what I intend to deliver as the 47th president of the United States. We're going to deliver everything that we want.' 'And we will have peace in the Middle East. We will have strength and resilience, and we will have a very powerful and strong Israel. And I will be with you all the way.' Lamenting the rise in antisemitism on the progressive left-wing of the Democratic party, Trump claimed the Republican party remains untainted by the 'horrible disease' of antisemitism. In a statement released Monday, the Trump campaign blamed the Biden administration's 'incompetence and weak policies' for the October 7th attacks, while arguing that if returned to office, Trump would 'end the bloodshed caused by an emboldened Iranian terrorist regime.'

Sinwar’s former interrogator says, ‘He is a danger to the world …...	Regarding the exchange for Sinwar along with 999 other prisoners for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, Koubi said, 'I warned them that if he were ever released, Gaza would become a state of terror.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Shin Bet agent Michael Koubi, who interrogated Yahya Sinwar for 180 hours, said the Hamas leader would never make peace with Israel and 'the only solution is to kill him.' Koubi recalled his first impression of the October 7th mastermind who was imprisoned in 1989 for torturing and killing Palestinians on suspicion of collaborating with Israel's military. 'I saw a man with murderous eyes, filled with nothing but hate,' Koubi said. Although the US and other countries urge Israel to accept a ceasefire with Hamas that will necessitate the release of many Palestinian prisoners in exchange for hostages, Koubi insists that there can never be peace with Sinwar in control. 'Sinwar will never, never, never accept peace,' Koubi said. 'As long as he is alive, he will carry out another massacre. He must be killed.' In 2011, when Israel announced that the terror leader known as 'The Butcher of Khan Younis' would be one of 1,000 Palestinian prisoners released in exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, Koubi tried to warn officials that Sinwar should not be on the list. 'I warned them that if he were ever released, Gaza would become a state of terror,' Koubi recalled. Following the release of Sinwar, he was given a hero's welcome in Gaza, was elevated to power, and planned the October 7th massacre, which left 1,200 people dead and 251 taken hostage. While being interrogated by Koubi, Sinwar boasted of torturing and killing his own people if he suspected they had any connection with Israel. 'He talked about beheading one suspect,' Koubi recalled. 'He talked about another victim who he took, had them dig a grave, and then buried him alive .' 'Even after all I've heard in my career, I was shocked at what he was telling me,' he added. 'How can someone be so gruesome? How can a man be this cruel?' Sinwar also boasted about training children to hate Jews and become terrorists. He discussed separating Palestinian schoolchildren into two groups: Jews and Arabs. 'He spoke one time about giving rubber knives to the kids and made a game of who could kill the most Jews,' Koubi said. 'I know him better than anyone, and he is a danger to the world,' he said. 'The only solution is to kill him.'

Qatari officials claim Sinwar is still alive and is in contact wi...	This claim is at odds with a recent report that a senior Qatari official said Sinwar never had direct contact with Qatari mediators. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Several media sources, including Al-Arabiya and the Daily Mail, claim that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is alive and has renewed communication with Qatari mediators. This claim is at odds with a recent Jerusalem Post report that a senior Qatari official said Sinwar never had direct communication with Qatari mediators, and that hostage deal and ceasefire negotiations were through senior Hamas political figure Khalil al-Hayah, not Sinwar. There was also recent speculation that Sinwar had been killed because he had not been in communication with his usual contacts for some time. Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind behind the October 7th terror attacks who took control of Hamas after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, was last seen in grainy footage lurking in a Khan Younis tunnel. There are reports that he surrounds himself with hostages as human shields to avoid assassination. Kobi Michael, Sinwar's former Shin Bet interrogator, told the Daily Mail that he carries 'about 25kg of dynamite. Around him are at least 20 hostages.' 'A few times, we have had the chance to kill him, but if we do, he will kill all the hostages around him,' Michael said. 'Yahya Sinwar will never surrender,' Michael told The London Times. 'He's dreaming about staying on as the leader of Hamas in Gaza. He's thinking now about the next massacre. That man must be killed.' Sinwar is said to avoid communicating through electronics, making him vulnerable to Israeli detection. Instead, he relies on couriers to deliver messages for him, and often, it takes days for people to hear back from him. Last month, rumors circulated that Sinwar had been killed in an Israeli airstrike, but these speculations are not new and may once again be false. Israeli journalist Ben Caspit quoted sources as saying: 'There have also been times in the past when he disappeared and we thought he was dead, but then he reappeared.'

How a farmer’s courage saved 120 lives on Oct 7	Davidian’s heroic efforts involved some 20 perilous trips spanning 15 to 17 kilometers between the festival grounds and nearby communities. By Jewish Breaking News As Israel solemnly marks one year since the devastating Hamas-led October 7 attacks, stories of extraordinary bravery continue to emerge. One such account, initially reported by the Times of Israel, stands out as a testament to the indomitable human spirit in the face of unimaginable horror. Oz Davidian, a farmer from Maslul near the Gaza border, became an unexpected hero on that fateful day. As Hamas terrorists unleashed chaos at the Nova music festival in Re’im, Davidian transformed his truck into a lifeline, rescuing approximately 120 young people from certain death. Chilling dashboard footage from Davidian’s vehicle, released months after the attack, provides a harrowing glimpse into the terror that unfolded. It shows Davidian navigating through a landscape of destruction, dodging gunfire, and maneuvering off-road to evade being killed. His voice can be heard warning passengers, 'Terrorists! Watch out!' as he swerves to safety. Davidian’s heroic efforts involved some 20 perilous trips between the festival grounds and nearby communities. Each journey spanned 15 to 17 kilometers, with Davidian ingeniously altering his route each time to outmaneuver the terrorists. All the while, his own family sheltered in their home’s shelter, their fate uncertain. The footage and subsequent interviews reveal the extent of the horror Davidian witnessed. He described scenes of unimaginable brutality, such as hundreds of corpses strewn across roads and fields, burning vehicles, and acts of violence too graphic to recount in detail. In one heart-stopping moment, Davidian found himself face-to-face with terrorists. Quick thinking and his knowledge of Arabic allowed him to escape, though not without coming under fire. 'By some miracle, none of them hit the car,' he later recalled. Davidian’s actions that day went beyond mere transportation. He became a beacon of hope for the terrified survivors, many of whom had been hiding for hours, convinced they had been abandoned. One rescued girl even mistook him for a special forces operative, unable to believe that a civilian would risk everything to save them.

A year later, Kibbutz Nir Oz still fighting to tell the real stor...	In the year since she survived the Hamas-led Oct. 7 massacre in her kibbutz, Nir Oz, Lahav has struggled to explain to international media what happened that day. By Andrew Tobin, The Washington Free Beacon Irit Lahav, a 58-year-old professional tour guide, knows how to walk clueless foreigners through unfamiliar terrain. But in the year since she survived the Hamas-led Oct. 7 massacre in her kibbutz, Nir Oz, Lahav has struggled to explain to international media what happened that day. No matter how many interviews she arranges with her traumatized neighbors or tours she gives of their burned-out homes, many journalists have continued to tell the story of the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust as another chapter in Israel’s supposed persecution of the Palestinians. 'People are saying Israel is bad,' Lahav, a former peace activist, told the Washington Free Beacon last week during a visit to Nir Oz, about a mile and a half from Israel’s border with southern Gaza. 'What? The Palestinians are holding our hostages &#8230; How would one feel if it was their daughter, their grandfather, their father, their 2 -year-old children, baby Kfir [Bibas in Hamas captivity in Gaza]?' 'The Palestinians are very good at PR, they've done a very good job, and Israeli people say, 'We don't need to explain ourselves because we know that we are moral people,'' she added. 'But at the end of the day, people only see what the media shows.' Once a leafy paradise, Nir Oz was one of the first Israeli communities to be overrun on Oct. 7, and it was among the hardest hit. About 120 Hamas and Hamas-affiliated terrorists followed by a mob of some 800 Gazans, including women and children, poured into the kibbutz over the course of the daylong pogrom, which overwhelmed unprepared Israeli security forces. The terrorists killed 41 people and abducted 76 others, according to the Nir Oz community. Most of the modest one-story houses and other buildings were destroyed by arson, gunfire, grenades, and looting. Israel responded with an ongoing war to destroy Hamas, the Iran-backed Palestinian terrorist group that governed Gaza, and return the hostages. Iran and its other terrorist affiliates, from Hezbollah in Lebanon to the Houthis in Yemen, have joined the multifront battle, which has threaten to expand into all-out regional war. A number of leading English-language news outlets have faced scrutiny for apparent anti-Israel bias in their coverage of the Gaza war and among staffers. The Washington Post has stood out from the crowd with repeated factual errors at Israel's expense and a foreign desk packed with former employees of Al Jazeera, a Qatari network that the Jewish state recently banned from operating in the country, citing alleged ties to Hamas. Lahav recalled with anger how the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported on the August funeral of Avraham Munder, 79, who was abducted from his home in Nir Oz on Oct. 7 along with his wife, daughter, and only grandson. The terrorists killed Munder's son during the attack. Munder 'suffered bodily and mental torture for months' in Hamas captivity before he was killed, according to the Nir Oz community. The CBC report, which aired on the state broadcaster’s flagship nightly news program, made no mention of the Oct. 7 attack or what happened to Munder or his family other than to question 'whether it was Hamas or Israel's attacks [on Hamas] that killed' him. Interviews with mourners focused solely on their complaints that the Israeli government had failed to secure the return of the abductees who remained in Gaza. The second half of the two-minute segment was dedicated to displaced and injured Palestinians in Gaza, especially children. 'Some of their gruesome injuries, including small headless bodies, are just too horrendous to show,' a voiceover intoned. Lahav accused the CBC of having 'completely erased' Hamas's atrocities in Nir On on Oct. 7. CBC did not respond to a request for comment. Most of the former residents of Nir Oz, including Lahav, have temporarily relocated to government-provided apartment towers in Kiryat Gat, a city in southern Israel. Locals fully furnished and equipped the apartments, even providing clothing, toothbrushes, and artwork. Every Friday, members of a different Israel community have brought the evacuees sweets. 'It's a very nice gesture,' Lahav said as people gathered to collect the sweets last week. 'Some of the people here who are receiving cakes and fruits are people who lost their loved ones or [whose loved ones] are still hostages in the hands of the Palestinians. You look at them, you would not even imagine that they're going through this emotional stress right now. But these are the people.' Forty women and children who were abducted from Nir Oz on Oct. 7 were returned in a November ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel, and another 16 have been confirmed dead, according to the Nir Oz community. Twenty have remained in Gaza, potentially alive. Negotiations for another hostage-ceasefire deal have gone nowhere. The former Nir Oz residents have begun planning to rebuild the kibbutz, but the process is expected to take at least three years, and they disagree about how to do so in a way that honors their dead and missing, Lahav said. Some of the former residents, especially those with young children, are not sure they will ever feel safe enough to go home. Meanwhile, Lahav has continued to drive an hour each way to Niz Oz once a week to give journalists tours of the kibbutz. She said she keeps fighting to tell the real story of Oct. 7 in hopes that the world will step up pressure on Hamas. 'My friends who are there [in Gaza, like] Oded Lifshitz, who was like my second father, how would he feel if I would just be sitting around doing nothing?' she said. 'I think they expect us, they expect the whole world to turn every stone and say, 'No.' They wait for us. They wait for us to rescue them, and 'us' is the whole world, the whole [of] humanity.'

IDF shoots down missile fired from Yemen at Tel Aviv	Take-offs and landings were briefly suspended at Tel Aviv’s Ben-Gurion International Airport due to the Yemeni threat. By JNS Millions of Israelis were sent running for shelters on Monday evening as Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists fired a missile at the densely populated Tel Aviv region, the Israel Defense Forces said. 'Following alerts that were activated in several areas in the center of the country, the Air Force successfully intercepted a surface-to-surface missile launched from Yemen,' the IDF posted on X. The missile was intercepted outside of Israel’s borders. Take-offs and landings were briefly suspended at Tel Aviv’s Ben-Gurion International Airport due to the Yemeni threat. The missile attack came as the Jewish state marked one year since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 cross-border massacre in which some 1,200 people, primarily Jewish civilians, were murdered, thousands were wounded and 251 were taken hostage to the Gaza Strip. On Sunday, Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi in a televised address said that the Iranian-backed terrorist proxies throughout the region have 'reached a point of inevitable confrontation' with Israel. 'Despite the scale of Israeli aggression, the inevitability of the enemy’s downfall is a certainty, grounded in religious and historical principles that must eventually be fulfilled,' the Yemeni terrorist claimed, according to a translation by Lebanon’s Al Mayadeen TV channel.

Some 80% of Gaza fatalities are Hamas or family members – report	According to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war. By JNS Hamas is privately admitting that 80% of the Palestinians killed during the year-long war in Gaza are Hamas members or their families, Israel’s Channel 12 reported on Sunday. The report comes as most of the international media continue to use unverified Hamas casualty figures, which do not differentiate between combatants and civilians and which statisticians have previously called into question. According to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, which was sparked by the terrorist group’s Oct. 7 massacre one year ago today. Israel has previously estimated that 17,000 combatants have been killed in Gaza. A report issued by the United Nations last month using the unverified Gaza Health Ministry data concluded that 51.3% of the total fatalities in Gaza were women and children. Earlier this year, a statistics expert said the Hamas claim that 70% of the casualties were women and children was 'statistically impossible' and 'not reliable at all.'

‘Zionist regime set back 70 years’ – Iran’s supreme leader celebr...	Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatens additional missile attacks on Israel, calls for Muslim nations to unify and defy 'the world's aggressors and arrogant powers,' calling Israel the 'rabid dog of the US.' By World Israel News Staff Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, marked the anniversary of October 7th Monday with a tweet celebrating last year's invasion of Israel, claiming the attacks and massacres set Israel back 70 years. Writing in Hebrew, the 85-year-old Shi'ite leader tweeted Monday morning that 'Operation Al Aqsa Flood set the Zionist regime back 70 years,' referring to the October 7th atrocities by the codename used by Hamas ahead of the invasion. The post was uploaded to X/Twitter at 6:29 a.m. Israel-time, coinciding with the timing of last year's invasion, and the beginning of Israeli President Isaac Herzog's memorial visit to Gaza border towns. A day earlier, Khamenei posted a series of messages to X/Twitter in English, defending last Tuesday's massive ballistic missile attack on Israel, which included the launching of some 200 missiles. 'The brilliant Operation True Promise 2 of our armed forces was completely legal and legitimate. And if necessary, this will be done again in the future,' wrote Khamenei,' calling Israel the 'rabid dog' of the United States. 'What our armed forces did was to inflict the minimum punishment on that usurping Zionist regime in response to its appalling crimes. It’s a bloodthirsty regime, a wolf-like regime, and the US’s rabid dog in the region.' Khamenei also called for Muslim unity against the West, apparently ignoring centuries-old tensions between Sunnis and Shi'ites. 'We must fortify our defenses and firmly protect our independence and dignity – from #Afghanistan to #Yemen, from #Iran to #Gaza and #Lebanon, in all Islamic countries and nations.' Iran's octogenarian spiritual leader also appeared to defend Hamas attacks on October 7th. 'Every nation has the right to defend its land against aggressors. It means that the Palestinian people have the right to stand against an enemy that has seized their land. The Palestinian nation has this right . This is a strong logic that international laws affirm today too.'

‘Put a sock in it’ – Bolton blasts Biden’s suggestion to Israel	Just incompetence' - Former US National Security Advisor John Bolton excoriates President Biden for urging Israel not to strike Iran's oil facilities. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Former U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton, who also served as America's ambassador to the United Nations, excoriated President Joe Biden over the weekend, after Biden publicly urged Israel to limit its response to a massive ballistic missile attack last week. On Tuesday, Iran launched roughly 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel, the Islamic republic's second large-scale ballistic missile attack on the Jewish state this year. Israel's prime minister and defense minister vowed the IDF carry out a major reprisal, and are reportedly considering striking either Iran's nuclear program, or its oil facilities. Biden suggested Friday that Israel refrain from attacking Iran's oil industry. 'If I were in their shoes, I’d be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.' Hours later, Bolton told CNN that Biden was 'making a huge mistake talking about any of Israel's possible options,' saying the president should 'put a sock in it.' 'Iran is an enemy of the United States. It has been a state sponsor of terrorism since the Reagan administration.' 'What the president is doing is publicly telling an enemy what he thinks an ally should do. He should put a sock in it and stop talking about it.' Bolton accused Biden of trying 'to put pressure on Israel' by going public with his position, rather than speaking privately to Israeli leaders. On Sunday, Bolton doubled down on his criticism of Biden, telling NewsNation he attributed the president's comments to cognitive decline. 'My first reaction was, it was just incompetence, or maybe it was mental capacity, or lack thereof.' 'I just think it’s wrong for an American president to speak publicly about what an American ally might do to an American enemy.' Bolton, a Republican who served in the George W. Bush and Trump administrations, publicly repudiated President Donald Trump after leaving the administration in 2019. In 2020, he refused to endorse either Trump or Biden, instead casting a write-in ballot for former Vice President Dick Cheney.

How blunders at an IDF base led to disaster October 7 – report	The army’s arrogance, unpreparedness and neglect to arm soldiers were some of the failures noted in a BBC report. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News There were multiple failures at the Nahal Oz army base attacked by Hamas forces on October 7, many of which could have been forestalled had the IDF acted differently, the BBC reported Friday. In anticipation of the anniversary Monday of Hamas’ surprise invasion that set off the ongoing war in Gaza, the global news service built a picture of what occurred at the base by, among other things, speaking to soldiers who had survived and families of the slain, and interviewing a former senior IDF commander. For starters, most of the soldiers on the base were unarmed, the report said, citing information slain soldiers’ families had received from the IDF. It had been revealed early on in the war that the mostly female soldiers who manned the screens linked to border cameras had warned their superiors multiple times for months about openly-practiced Hamas military exercises of take-overs of Israeli communities, which were ignored. But, the report said, it was not only observers at the Nahal Oz base on the Gazan border who knew that Hamas was planning some kind of attack. Other soldiers were also suspicious and fearful, especially when all activity stopped on the enemy side a few days prior. 'There was nothing and that was frightening us,' one infantry soldier told the British broadcaster. 'Everybody felt that something was strange. It didn’t make sense.' But at 6:20, an unending rocket barrage began, and at 6:30 the observers began reporting multiple breaches of the border fence by Hamas fighters. The early warning system steadily collapsed as one surveillance camera after another was destroyed by enemy gunfire. In addition, three observation balloons out of the five that were always supposed to be operational to see further into Gaza all along the Strip, were not working, including the one at Nahal Oz. 'No-one was stressed' about this, the father of a soldier who worked with the balloon, said. 'They were told it would be fixed on Sunday. There was an atmosphere like: ‘Hamas is deterred, even if something happens it's a terrorist infiltration or at most a terrorist squad.’' As the IDF has documented since, some 6,000 terrorists entered Israel that Sabbath, breaking through the border fence in 119 places in all. At Nahal Oz, at first dozens of Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters penetrated the base, joined in the following hours by hundreds more. The few armed soldiers fought back bravely, while those not armed crowded into locked areas, such as the observers’ war room. When the terrorists managed to shut down the electricity, the doors automatically unlocked, and the inside protective force was overwhelmed. Some 60 soldiers were killed in Nahal Oz, several of the dead as well as live observers were taken hostage, and the post was partially burned to the ground. In responding to all these incidents, Gen. (ret.) Israel Ziv, a former head of the Gaza Division and IDF Operations Division, told the BBC that the army did not understand the situation due to 'a lot of arrogance,' in which the predominant thought was that 'Hamas wouldn’t attack, wouldn’t dare, and that even if so, they are not capable.' He praised the observers, saying, that they 'were amazing - the mistake was the system, the commanders, not them,' and criticized the decision to have so many soldiers go about unarmed, saying, 'It doesn’t make sense… The soldier is about the weapon.' If they were depending on door locks instead, he added later in the interview, the IDF system had 'already failed.' Another IDF failure, he said, was not training for a possible base infiltration. 'That was part of the whole mess because once the enemy surprised them and went into the base they were not ready. The whole thing collapsed,' he noted. Soldiers described to the BBC how they did not understand what was going on for the longest time, an incomprehension that was reflected in the upper echelons as well, which left the Nahal Oz troops, as well as so many others in communities along the border, fighting on their own for many hours. Ziv described October 7 in general as 'a perfect storm,' and that 'We went to sleep on the 6th thinking there’s a cat over there and we woke up on the 7th and there’s a tiger.'

After a year of war, wounded Israeli reservists face long road to...	As of September, more than 10,000 wounded soldiers have been treated by the Rehabilitation Department of the Ministry of Defense. By Reuters and The Algemeiner Ten months after he was shot in the leg by a sniper in Gaza, Israeli reservist Aaron Bours is walking on crutches and hoping to make a full recovery from the wound he sustained trying to rescue his officer in an ambush. 'There were bullets all around me,' Bours said. Three hours after he was shot, he was in surgery at Sheba Medical center near Tel Aviv where doctors were able to save his leg. Long months of intense rehabilitation followed. Some 300,000 reservists were called up at the beginning of the war and many have served for months on multiple tours. Their experience, and the experience of the families they left, will color attitudes in Israel for years to come. As of September, more than 10,000 wounded soldiers have been treated by the Rehabilitation Department of the Ministry of Defense since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7 that triggered Israel’s invasion of the Gaza Strip. More than two thirds of those treated have been reservists who returned to their military units from civilian life. Just over a third are dealing with limb injuries, with the rest dealing with a variety of internal and spinal injuries, as well as eye, ear and head wounds that underscore the intense combat in the ruins of Gaza. Israel Dudkiewicz, the doctor who runs the rehabilitation center at Sheba Medical Center, said the hospital understood on Oct. 7 that they would need to expand to receive an influx of wounded patients. With around a quarter of its staff called as reserves themselves, the hospital added beds and opened three new wings to treat the injured. 'I can’t say it wasn’t challenging,' said Dudkiewicz. 'But in the end we were able to provide service.' But the impact of serious injuries on reservists, who will return to civilian life when the fighting is over, will be felt for many years. Yosi Sochr, 34, was severely wounded when an explosive device was detonated remotely. Doctors are still not sure if he will ever regain full use of his left arm and shoulder, which were hit by a piece of shrapnel. So far he can move his hand but not the rest of his arm. 'It was hard,' said the reservist in the hospital bed next to his wife. 'I’m not a 20-year-old kid. I have a whole world around me – when I just disappear, it’s felt.'

Bereaved families mark Oct. 7 at Nova massacre site	On Oct. 7, Hamas massacred 364 of the approximately 3,500 participants and staff at the festival, with terrorists raping, burning alive, and mutilating their victims. By Amelie Botbol, JNS Families of the 364 people murdered by Hamas at the Supernova music festival on Oct. 7, 2023, gathered on Monday at the site near Kibbutz Re’im in southern Israel to honor their loved ones on the one-year anniversary of the massacre. Families arrived at the site at 6. a.m.; at 6:29 a.m., the exact time at which Hamas terrorists launched their assault, music that had been playing was stopped and a commemorative siren sounded. document.createElement('video'); The siren was followed by a minute of silence, during which the Israeli flag was lowered to half-mast. The song 'The Children of Winter 2023' was played, and then the 'Yizkor' prayer was recited. Bereaved families recited the kaddish mourning prayer. 'Shani saved many people on Oct. 7, she saw terrorists arriving and blocked them with her car,' Yaakov Gabay, whose daughter Shani was killed while trying to escape the festival, told JNS at Monday’s ceremony. 'It’s even harder a year later. I come here a lot. I was here last Oct. 7 to look for Shani and I saved many people. I didn’t manage to save her, but it’s essential for me to be here because I know what happened,' he added. Adi Yehudai, whose brother Ron was killed on Oct. 7, told JNS: 'This is the place where they were murdered, so being here was the most appropriate thing to do, especially on the first-year anniversary. 'We wanted to keep this as authentic as possible and not political. We wanted to connect to the land that is soaked with their blood. 'I was here a lot over the year, but today it’s a little more emotional. We have another ceremony at 11:47 near the yellow garbage container he hid in,' he continued. 'I will use Ron’s motto; We only live once, so we need to live. I believe if he were here he would tell me to smile and enjoy every second, because that’s how he lived,' he said. On Oct. 7, Hamas massacred 364 of the approximately 3,500 participants and staff at the festival, with terrorists raping, burning alive and mutilating their victims. Hamas terrorists kidnapped 43 people to Gaza, five of whom were released in November as part of a weeklong ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. On Jun. 8, Nova attendees Noa Argamani, 26, Almog Meir Jan, 21, Andrey Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 40, were freed by the Israel Defense Forces during a daring daylight raid in the heart of a crowded residential neighborhood in Gaza. On Aug. 31, Israeli forces recovered the bodies of six hostages from an underground tunnel in Rafah in southern Gaza. Five of them—Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, Eden Yerushalmi, 24, Almog Sarusi, 25, Alexander Lobanov, 32, and Master Sgt. Ori Danino, 25—had been kidnapped from the festival. The IDF has rescued the bodies of seven additional hostages from the Palestinian enclave. Twenty-one Nova attendees remain in Gaza, with 17 presumed to be alive. Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Monday began a memorial journey through Gaza border communities at the festival site, where he laid a wreath and lit candles in honor of the victims. 'Oct. 7, 2023, is a day that should be remembered in infamy, when thousands of cruel terrorists broke into our homes, violated our families, burned, chopped, raped and hijacked and abducted our citizens, our brothers and sisters, and with them, people from 36 different nationalities,' said Herzog. 'This is a scar on humanity. This is a scar on the face of the Earth. 'We have to do whatever we can by all ways and means possible to bring back our hostages who are there in the tunnels and dungeons of Gaza. And the world has to realize and understand that in order to change the course of history and bring peace, a better future to the region, it must support Israel in its battle against its enemies,' continued the president. 'Blessed be those who fell, who were murdered and killed here. Young people who came to celebrate and enjoy dance and music – to live a real life of young people as any young person should be entitled to. Let us remember them forever. Let us pray, with remorse, pain, bereavement, and condolences to their families,' added Herzog. Ori Ohayon, who lost his sister Eden in the Nova massacre, told JNS that he remains deeply affected by the trauma. 'We are triplets, it’s like something happened to our body that day for me and my brother,' Ohayon said on Monday. 'We had lost contact for three days, we looked for my sister and my cousin and didn’t find anything. Then my mother received the news. 'We must commemorate them and remember them always. Grief and sadness will be part of everything I do in my life. Eden will accompany me everywhere,' he added.

‘A scar on humanity’ – Israeli, French, and British leaders mark ...	A day that will live in infamy' - British Prime Minister and French and Israeli presidents mark first anniversary of October 7th invasion. By World Israel News Staff The Prime Minister of Britain and the President of France issued statements Monday marking the first anniversary of the October 7th invasion of southwestern Israel and subsequent massacres, while Israel's president began a memorial tour of the border communities devastated in last year's attacks. At 6:29 a.m. Monday, Israeli President Isaac Herzog began the memorial tour at the site of the Nova music festival outside of Kibbutz Re'im near the Gaza frontier, the scene of one of the largest massacres on October 7th, during which over 360 people were killed, dozens taken hostage, and hundreds wounded. The memorial tour began with a moment of silence, after which Herzog laid a wreath and lit memorial candles in honor of the victims, accompanied by their bereaved families. 'October 7, 2023, is a day that should be remembered in infamy, when thousands of cruel terrorists broke into our homes, violated our families, burned, chopped, raped, and hijacked and abducted our citizens, our brothers and sisters, and with them, people from 36 different nationalities,' said Herzog. 'This is a scar on humanity. This is a scar on the face of the Earth.' 'The world has to realize and understand that in order to change the course of history and bring peace, a better future to the region, it must support Israel in its battle against its enemies. We are fighting the battle of the free world.' Herzog's French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, marked the first anniversary of October 7th with tweets in French, Hebrew, and English, saying France identified with 'the pain of the Israeli people.' 'October 7. The pain remains, as vivid as it was a year ago. The pain of the Israeli people. Ours. The pain of wounded humanity.' 'We do not forget the victims, the hostages, or the families with broken hearts from absence or waiting. I send them our fraternal thoughts.' Macron, who on Saturday vowed to impose an arms embargo on Israel, spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone over the weekend regarding Macron's statement and Netanyahu's subsequent public criticism. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whose government has already imposed a partial arms embargo on Israel, tweeted that his government would 'stand with the Jewish community' and work to 'secure a better future for the Middle East.' '7 October 2023 was the darkest day in Jewish history since the Holocaust.' 'One year on from these horrific attacks we must unequivocally stand with the Jewish community and unite as a country.' 'We will not falter in our pursuit of peace and on this day of pain and sorrow, we honour those we lost, and continue in our determination to return those still held hostage, help those who are suffering, and secure a better future for the Middle East.'

‘Only strengthens Iran’ – In phone call with Macron, Netanyahu ri...	Prime Minister Netanyahu presses Macron to drop his push to impose an arms embargo on Israel, saying such 'restrictions' would only benefit Iran and its proxies. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on the phone Sunday with French President Emmanuel Macron, a day after Macron announced his plans to impose sweeping restrictions on weapons sales to Israel. According to a statement released by the Prime Minister's Office, during the call, Netanyahu emphasized that Israel 'expects its friends to stand behind it,' adding that imposing sanctions now against Israel will only strengthen the 'Iranian axis of evil.' Netanyahu also argued that Israel's recent attacks against Hezbollah have created an opportunity to change the reality in Lebanon in favor of stability, security and peace in the entire region. The two leaders agreed to advance dialogue on the issue during the visit of the French Foreign Minister, who is scheduled to visit Israel on Monday. Macron, for his part, vowed to uphold his nation's 'unwavering commitment' to Israeli security, according to a statement by his office, but fell short of agreeing to walk back his call for an arms embargo. 'On the eve of the first anniversary of Hamas' terrorist offensive against Israel' on October 7, 2023, Macron 'expressed the solidarity of the French people with the Israeli people.' 'The President of the Republic reiterated to the Israeli Prime Minister that France's commitment to Israel's security is unwavering and reminded him of the mobilisation of French military resources to defend it during the attacks carried out by Iran in recent months.' During their conversation, the French president reiterated his call for a ceasefire in Gaza, expressing 'his conviction that the time for a ceasefire has now come.'

A year later: Hostage’s family told he was murdered on Oct. 7th	We waited 12 months for nothing,' says murdered hostage's father. By World Israel News Staff A young man kidnapped from the Nova Festival, who was presumed for the last year to be a living hostage, was murdered on October 7th, 2023 during the massacre. His body is still being held in the Gaza Strip by the Hamas terror group, Hebrew-language media reported on Monday morning. Idan Shtivi, 28, was initially reported missing following the festival. He had called his girlfriend around 7 A.M., telling her he was leaving the event due to rocket fire. Investigators determined that while driving away from the festival, terrorists had sprayed a volley of bullets at Shtivi's car. He apparently lost control of his vehicle, crashing and hitting a tree. The bodies of two of Shtivi's friends, who were shot to death, were discovered in his bullet-ridden vehicle several days later. For several months, Shtivi's fate was unknown, as Israeli forensic services struggled to identify dozens of victims from the festival who had been burned or mutilated beyond recognition. In January 2024, Shtivi's family was officially informed by the Israeli government that he was classified as a hostage. They were told had been kidnapped from southern Israel by terrorists during the Hamas onslaught and that he was taken back to the Gaza Strip. Shtivi's father, Eli, has emerged as one of the most prominent public faces representing the hostages' families and their struggle for their loved ones' release. Along with freed hostage Noa Argamani and her father, Eli Shtivi accompanied Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Washington D.C. for his July speech to Congress. But exactly year after the bloodiest day in Israel's history, the Israeli government informed the Shtivi family that their son was actually murdered on October 7th. 'We waited 12 months for nothing,' Eli Shtivi said in a brief statement to the media. 'We share in the family's deep sorrow,' the Missing and Hostage Families Forum said in a statement. 'Idan Shtivi loved nature and photography. He was very attached to dogs and animals and was supposed to start his second year studying sustainability and governance at Reichman University. Idan always thought of others and sacrificed himself for the good of those around him.

Kamala Harris refuses to call Netanyahu an ‘ally’ of America	Vice President Kamala Harris says Biden administration 'putting pressure on Israel' to reach ceasefire with Hamas, dodges question on whether Netanyahu is a close ally of the US. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Vice President Kamala Harris refused to answer whether she considers Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a 'close ally' of the United States, dodging a direct question during a recent interview with CBS' '60 Minutes.' During the interview, which is slated to air Monday night with a teaser released on Sunday, the vice president was pressed on American aid to Israel, and questioned over the alleged inability of the Biden administration to rein in the Israeli government vis-a-vis the war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the IDF's incursion into southern Lebanon, and the possibility of a major Israeli reprisal against Iran following a massive ballistic missile attack last week. Harris defended American aid to the Jewish state, calling it 'imperative' to enable Israel to 'defend itself from those kinds of attacks' launched by 'Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran.' 'The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel.' At the same time, Harris emphasized that the White House is applying 'pressure on Israel' to reach a ceasefire with Hamas and to ensure the flow of aid to the Gaza Strip. 'The work we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done that would release the hostages and create a cease-fire.' 'We're not going to stop putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders.' When asked whether Netanyahu is a 'real close ally' of the United States, and why the Israeli government appears to defy the Biden administration on major issues, Harris avoided giving direct responses. 'I think, with all due respect, the better question is, do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? The answer to that question is yes.'

Despite US pressure, ‘all options on the table’ for Iran strike	The 'door to change in the entire Middle East' is now open, says Defense Minister. By World Israel News Staff Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said that Israel is considering a wide range of options for a retaliatory strike against Iran, following an unprecedented attack last week in which the Islamic Republic launched some 200 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State. 'Israel has capabilities to hit targets near and far — we have proved it. We will respond to the Iranian attack appropriately. We will not stand by and neither should the international community,' Gallant told CNN. When asked about specific sites that Israel may target, Gallant said that 'everything is on the table.' He stressed the importance of Israel's intensive campaign against Hezbollah, which saw the assassination of its leader Hassan Nasrallah and the crippling of the group's military capabilities. Weakening Hezbollah 'has made a crack that now opens the door to change not just in Lebanon, but in the entire Middle East,' Gallant said. The U.S. recently announced that Gallant is set to visit Washington meet with his American counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, presumably to coordinate regarding Israel's response to the Iranian attack. While Washington initially said it would help Israel exact 'serious consequences' against Iran for the missile barrage, President Joe Biden has made a number of statements in recent days apparently walking back that commitment. Biden told a reporter that 'the answer is no' when asked if he supported a potential Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear development sites. Additionally, Biden stressed that he was opposed to an Israeli attack on Iran's oil assets, which would punish the Islamic regime economically. 'If I were in [Israel's] shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oilfields,' Biden said, without offering other potential targets. Biden also claimed that Israel is obligated to respond 'proportionately' to the attack, which is believed to be one of the largest ballistic missile barrages in history.

Hamas terrorists murder Gazan woman for refusing to hand over cha...	She was on her way to deliver funds and visit patients in a hospital in Khan Younis when she was confronted by Hamas terrorists who demanded that she hand over her funds to them. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A Gazan woman, Islam Hijazi, was gunned down in her car in Khan Younis by Hamas for refusing to hand over funds raised for Gazan civilians by her organization. Islam Hijazi, a mother of two young children, was head of HEAL Palestine, an NGO that funds healthcare and humanitarian aid to Gazan civilians. She was on her way to deliver funds and visit patients in a hospital in Khan Younis when she was confronted by Hamas terrorists who demanded that she hand over her funds to them. When Hijazi refused, terrorists opened fire on her, and 90 bullets entered her body. 'Islam was a mother of two young children, a humane woman with the highest ethics and professionalism. She stayed in Gaza intentionally to help others. She always said, 'I'm staying here to help our people,'' The NGO said in a statement following the murder. Iyad Khader, a Gaza resident, posted on social media, writing, 'A mafia has recently been established in the southern part of the Strip to loot, kill, steal and terrorize the residents. War must declare war on them immediately.' A political researcher from Gaza, Hussein Jamal said, 'This isn't the first of such a case. The truth is that civilians are murdered daily and no one talks about it. Hijazi was unfortunately well-known; otherwise, no one would have known the circumstances or details of her death.' In December, a Palestinian man in Gaza told an IDF soldier during a recorded conversation that Hamas is stealing UNWRA humanitarian aid, according to a report Monday by the New York Post. When the soldier was telling Gazan civilians where to evacuate and seek supplies during the military campaign, a Palestinian man voluntarily came up. He told him the true situation of the UNWRA (The United Nations Relief and Works Agency)–that it is under the direct control of Hamas which is stealing the humanitarian aid. He said in a recording, 'The situation is terrible because the humanitarian people, those responsible for the humanitarian aid, are thieves.' 'Hamas has their hands on UNRWA administration workers, and it manages UNRWA,' he explained. 'From the day they [Hamas] rose to power, they took control of everything.' He also described how Hamas kept the lion's share of the humanitarian aid for their own terrorist leaders and forces when they were supposed to distribute the supplies to civilians.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Israel's National Insurance Institute has released shocking statistics on the toll the year-long war has taken on Israel's civilian population, Ynet reports. The statistics do not include military personnel and soldiers, which the Defense Ministry updates. Since October 7th, 2023, 885 civilians were killed, including 581 men and 304 women; 72 were foreign nationals, and 53 were minors. Of the children who were killed, four were age 0-3, two were 3-5, three were 5-8, nine were 8-12, eight were 12-14 and 27 were age 14-18. A total of 921 became orphans as a result of the war, including 291 minors. In addition, 226 people were widowed, including 47 men and 179 women. Parents who became bereaved totaled 1,078, 581 of them mothers and 498 fathers. Of these bereaved parents, 120 lost all of their children. The number of those who have lost siblings is 1,880, including 998 men and 882 women.

Iran cancels all overnight flights as it braces for a retaliation...	An Iranian state-run outlet, cited 'operational restrictions' for the cancellations, as the government braces for an expected Israeli response to the launch of 200 missiles last Tuesday. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News All flights from Iranian airports scheduled between 9pm on Sunday until 6am on Monday have been canceled in anticipation of an expected Israeli retaliation for the Iranian attack last week. The cancellations were confirmed by Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization. Iranian authorities sent out the notice to pilots or NOTAM with exceptions for 'emergency flight, ferry flights and state aircraft.' IRNA, an Iranian state-run outlet, cited 'operational restrictions' for the cancellations, as the government braces for an expected Israeli response to the launch of 200 missiles last Tuesday. Following last week’s unprecedented direct attack by Iran, Israeli security officials are weighing possible options for a retaliatory strike against the Islamic Republic. The Israeli military recently admitted that Iranian missiles struck several air forces bases, though the IDF spokesman stressed that the impacts had not affected operations, nor had aircraft sustained damage. Immediately following the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised speech that Iran had 'made a big mistake' by attacking, and that Tehran 'would pay' for sending some 9 million Israelis into bomb shelters. In a subsequent speech, Netanyahu hinted that Israel may assassinate top Iranian leaders, such as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameinei, as part of its retaliatory attack. 'When Iran is finally free — and that moment will come a lot sooner than people think – everything will be different,' Netanyahu said. The headquarters of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps or its presidential palace are also potential symbolic targets that could serve as a blow to the morale of the regime. Beyond killing Iranian government officials, there are a number of different targets that Israel could choose to restore its deterrence against Iran. According to a Ma’ariv report, the Israeli military is considering striking Iranian military assets, such as the sites from which the ballistic missiles were launched. An attack targeting Iran’s oil production facilities and fields could also levy a defeating economic blow against Tehran. Israel could also leverage the momentum of the current moment to finally strike Iran’s nuclear development sites. The Jewish State has been seeking international legitimacy for such a move for years.

Former hostage’s joyful news touches Israeli hearts	Taking to Instagram over the weekend, Doron announced that she is expecting her third child with her husband Yoni. By Jewish Breaking News While much of the news surrounding Israel’s darkest day on October 7 remains somber, occasionally a story emerges that offers a ray of hope. One such story is that of Doron Katz-Asher, who was taken hostage by Hamas terrorists while visiting family in Kibbutz Nir Oz on that fateful day. Along with her daughters Raz (4) and Aviv (2), Doron endured 49 days of captivity in the hell pits of Gaza before being released in a temporary truce deal. Despite losing her mother in the attack and some family members still missing, Doron has found the strength to embrace new beginnings and hope for the future. Taking to Instagram over the weekend, Doron announced that she is expecting her third child with her husband Yoni. ‘Bringing life into the world, a year after I almost lost my own, is the greatest gift we could ask for in the new year. My ray of light in the darkness,’ Doron wrote.

IDF troops seized 70k Hamas assets since war’s start	Some of the Hamas terrorist assets retrieved by Israeli soldiers will be put on display this week for diplomats, visiting researchers and the foreign press. By JNS Israel Defense Forces troops confiscated some 70,000 terrorist assets from the Gaza Strip and the border region since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led massacre almost one year ago, the military revealed on Sunday. Among the assets seized, the Military Intelligence Directorate’s Intelligence and Technical Haul Collection Unit confiscated some 1,250 ammunition rounds and anti-tank missiles, as well as 4,500 explosive charges. Some of the Hamas terrorist assets retrieved by Israeli soldiers will be put on display this week for diplomats, visiting researchers and the foreign press at the IDF Technological and Logistics Directorate base in Tzrifin, near Rishon LeZion in central Israel. The exhibition includes vehicles and equipment with which the terrorists infiltrated the Jewish state on Oct. 7, among them trucks, motorcycles and tractors. Also on display are Hamas terrorist uniforms, intelligence documents, rockets, missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. The exhibit, which will run at least until the end of the week, was established to mark the 'anniversary of the murderous massacre on October 7 … with the aim of exposing it to the world,' the IDF stated. Israeli forces are on high alert ahead of Oct. 7, with military intelligence indicating the possibility of rocket fire, including towards Tel Aviv and the central region, Israel’s Kan News broadcaster reported on Sunday. Alongside increased counter-terror operations in the Gaza Strip, the IDF’s Southern Command reinforced troops on the border with the enclave, the military said on Sunday. IDF units are 'prepared in defense and attack for several scenarios during the coming month, along with the safe facilitation of memorial events' in border towns. 'The fighters are ready to defend the area in cooperation with local security forces, police and Magen David Adom to provide a complete response to various incidents in the sector,' the IDF said.

‘UNRWA is out’: Knesset committee moves to curb UNRWA activities ...	The open sessions included testimonies from social organizations, researchers, and families of victims, some of whom were reportedly harmed by individuals associated with UNRWA in Gaza. By Sveta Listratov, TPS The Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee unanimously approved two legislative proposals on Sunday aimed at curbing the activities of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) within Israel. The committee’s decision marks a significant step in the ongoing discourse surrounding UNRWA’s role and operations. 'UNRWA is out!' Committee Chairman MK Yuli Edelstein declared at the end of the vote. 'The problem of UNRWA did not begin on October 7; it has long been a concern that has surfaced in all its malignancy. For many years, lawmakers from across the political spectrum have raised the issue and advanced legislative proposals.' The first proposal approved by the Committee, introduced by MK Boaz Bismuth from Likud and merged with an initiative from MK Sharren Haskel from the Yamin Mamlakhti party, stipulates that UNRWA will not operate any representation, provide services, or conduct any activities—directly or indirectly—within the sovereign territory of Israel. The second proposal consolidates three initiatives submitted by a group of other lawmakers and states that the invitation for UNRWA, based on correspondence exchanged between Israel and the agency dating back to June 14, 1967, concerning Israel’s facilitation of UNRWA’s operations, will expire on October 7, 2024, or upon final approval of the law in the Knesset. Furthermore, the proposal mandates that no state authority, including public officials and bodies, may engage with UNRWA or its representatives. Following extensive discussions, some of which were open to the public and others classified, the proposals were passed unanimously by the committee. The open sessions included testimonies from social organizations, researchers, and families of victims, some of whom were reportedly harmed by individuals associated with UNRWA in Gaza. During confidential sessions, the committee, alongside the Foreign, Defense, Justice, and Treasury ministries, examined the far-reaching implications of the proposals across diplomatic, legal, security, and economic domains. Numerous meetings took place between professional bodies and the legal advisory team to ensure the drafts addressed a wide array of concerns raised during the discussions. Chairman Edelstein emphasized the urgency of the legislation, criticizing UNRWA’s actions during the recent war and highlighting that, 'We know that some of the hostages were held by individuals working for the organization.' The scrutiny of UNRWA intensified following revelations that members of its staff allegedly participated in the October 7 attacks, which resulted in the deaths of at least 1,200 people and the abduction of 252 Israelis and foreigners. The Israeli government has increasingly demanded that UNRWA be stripped of its authority in Gaza, further asserting that humanitarian aid should bypass the agency. Recently, the UN announced the firing of nine UNRWA staff members for their involvement in the October 7 assaults, but this has been met with outrage in Israel, where officials claim the UN’s internal investigations failed to address the involvement of approximately 100 other personnel. 'The UN investigation, which focused exclusively on 19 UNRWA workers, is a disgrace! Too little and too late,' tweeted former Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan, emphasizing that Israel had provided the UN with detailed information about over a hundred UNRWA employees with ties to Hamas. UNRWA has faced scrutiny not only for its alleged role in the October 7 attacks but also for ongoing accusations of facilitating Hamas operations within its facilities. For instance, Israeli forces discovered a Hamas complex beneath UNRWA’s Gaza City headquarters earlier this year. Furthermore, more than 100 survivors of the October 7 attacks have filed a $1 billion lawsuit against UNRWA, alleging the agency 'aided and abetted' Hamas. With the proposals set to take effect 90 days after their final approval, the committee has mandated regular reporting from the National Security Headquarters to oversee the implementation of the law. With the Knesset poised to finalize the legislation, the implications for UNRWA’s future operations and funding remain uncertain. Israeli officials are advocating for a restructuring of refugee aid, calling for Palestinian refugees to fall under the mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, as they assert that the current setup is unsustainable and detrimental to Israeli security.

In a powerful gesture of solidarity, Sid Rosenberg, the #1 rated talk show host in New York City, has returned to Israel to broadcast live from Israel. By Juda Honickman, World Israel News As we approach the one-year anniversary of October 7th, we find ourselves reflecting on a day that left an indelible mark on our nation. It was a day filled with tragedy, loss, and fear — a stark reminder of the challenges that Israel faces daily. Yet, in the year since, we have witnessed remarkable resilience and unity. The events of that day ignited a renewed commitment among supporters of Israel to stand together in the face of adversity. In a powerful gesture of solidarity, Sid Rosenberg, the #1 rated talk show host in New York City, has returned to Israel to broadcast 'Sid and Friends in the Morning' on WABC live from Israel this week.

To mark the anniversary of October 7th, Sid will broadcast from Sderot, a city that embodies the spirit of resilience and courage in the face of ongoing challenges. Sderot's residents have faced the trials of conflict and insecurity, yet they remain steadfast in their determination to build a future of hope and peace. Through Sid's broadcasts, listeners will gain a firsthand perspective on the realities of life in this remarkable community. While is Sderot, Sid will be joined on the air with a special guest - former U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump’s strong support for Israel significantly impacted the global stage, by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and relocating US embassy there, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, exiting the nuclear deal with Iran and imposing harsh sanctions the Islamic regime, and fostering peace in the region through the Abraham Accords. His participation in Sid’s broadcast underscores the vital importance of American support for Israel, especially during times of crisis. Together, they will engage in meaningful discussions about the challenges Israel faces today and why it is crucial for our allies to remain steadfast in their support. World Israel News encourages everyone to tune in to Sid’s broadcasts throughout the week, especially on October 7th from Sderot. Listen to the voices of the people living through these realities and hear the important discussions that will take place.

‘Iran hasn’t touched a single IDF aircraft or runway,’ boasts Isr...	Despite extensive air campaign against Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed forces, and terrorist missile attacks on Israeli airbases, Israel's air force remains 'untouched' by Iran, says Defense Minister. By World Israel News Staff Israel's air force has emerged from the ongoing conflicts against Hamas, Hezbollah, Yemenite Houthi rebels, and other Iranian proxies in the Middle East completely unscathed, Israel's defense minister said Sunday. On Sunday, Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant visited the Nevatim Air Force base outside of Beersheba in southern Israel. During his visit, Gallant was briefed by the Commander of Nevatim Airbase, Brig. Gen. Yotam Sigler, on the squadrons’ operations in the various arenas. The Minister spoke with pilots and air and ground crews, and expressed his appreciation for their service over the past year. After speaking with Sigler, Gallant boasted that despite the Israel Air Force's extensive operations on multiple fronts since October 7th, 2023, the IAF has not suffered a single loss or even damaged aircraft. 'The IAF’s operations – both defensive and offensive, ensures the security of the citizens of Israel,' Gallant said. 'The Iranians have not even ‘touched’ the IAF’s capabilities- not a single squadron has been damaged, not a single aircraft has been damaged, there is not a single runway that is out of order and there is no disruption in our operations.' 'Whoever thinks that by attempting to harm Israel they will deter us from taking action, should take a look at [Israel's military operations] in Gaza and in Beirut.' 'We are powerful in both defense and offense, and this will be reflected in the manner of our choosing, at the time and place of our choosing. You know what to do, we know what to do and at the end of this, we will ensure that we win this war, bring home the hostages, and ensure the return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes, while Israel deters its enemies.' Hezbollah and other Iranian proxy forces operating out of Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq have targeted Israeli airbases repeatedly over the past year. Iran itself has attempted to strike Israeli Air Force bases in its ballistic missile attacks in April and October.

One dead, 9 wounded in terrorist shooting attack at bus station i...	At least six people wounded, including one in critical condition, after terrorist opens fire at McDonald's restaurant outside of bus station in Beersheba. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News At least one person was killed and eight others were wounded Sunday afternoon, when a terrorist gunman opened fire at two separate locations in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba. The shootings took place at two locations adjacent to the Beersheba Central Bus Station, including at a McDonald's restaurant, following by a shooting on a nearby street. Eyewitnesses say the terrorist was wearing a bulletproof vest during the attack. Police and security personnel have been deployed to the area and the terrorist gunman has been killed, authorities say. Emergency first responders from Magen David Adom (MDA) and United Hatzalah were dispatched to the scene to treat the wounded and evacuate them to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba. One victim, a woman in her 20s, was critically wounded in the attack, and later succumbed to her wounds. A second victim, a man, is listed in moderate-to-serious condition, while four others are in moderate condition, and the remainder are listed in light condition. Three of the first responders who arrived after the shooting, United Hatzalah volunteer EMTs Eliyah Tubul, Yosefi Asor and Daniel Levy, reported from the scene: 'We provided initial treatment at the scene to a young woman who was seriously injured and was later transported to the hospital, to another woman who was in critical condition and to four people who were moderately and lightly to moderately injured.' 'In addition, we provided assistance at the scene to a number of people who suffered from emotional shock due to the nature of the incident.' Last week, seven people were murdered when two terrorists, both Palestinian Arabs from the city of Hebron, opened fire on pedestrians in Jaffa, south of Tel Aviv.

Commander of Iran’s Quds Force missing after IDF airstrike	Esmail Qaani, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' overseas operations, reportedly incommunicado for days following Israeli airstrike that killed new Hezbollah chief. By World Israel News Staff The commander of the force responsible for the overseas operations of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps may have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on Thursday, The New York Times reported over the weekend. Citing reports by Iranian media outlets, the Times claimed that Brigadier General Esmail Qaani, commander of the IRCG's Quds Force, was likely either injured or killed in the October 3rd bombing of a Hezbollah position in Beirut, during which Hashem Safieddine is believed to have died. Safieddine, the cousin of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, replaced Nasrallah as commander of the Lebanese Shi'ite terror group after Nasrallah was killed in an IDF bombing on September 27th. According to Iranian officials cited by Persian media outlets, Tehran has not been in contact with Qaani since the October 3rd bombing, and Iran's leadership itself is unsure of his condition. One member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said that the silence from Iran's leadership regarding the sudden disappearance of the senior Quds Force officer was fomenting panic within the IRGC. Qaani was conspicuously absent from a memorial service hosted in Tehran by Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, honoring Nasrallah. The 67-year-old officer was tapped to head the Quds Force in 2020, after an American drone strike killed his predecessor, Brigadier General Qasem Soleimani. Three Iranian officials cited in the Times report claimed that Qaani was in Beirut last week to help Hezbollah's leadership regroup following a string of deadly attacks targeting its top echelon, including the killing of Nasrallah, the elimination of top leaders of the terror group's elite Radwan Force in September, and a string of pager and radio bombings that killed dozens of operatives and injured thousands.

Vice President Kamala Harris meets with Arab American activists in Michigan, reportedly pledging to do 'everything' in her power to end the war against Hamas. By World Israel News Staff Vice President Kamala Harris met with Arab American and Muslim activists in Michigan on Friday, in a bid to bolster support from the state's significant Arab and Muslim communities amid ongoing criticism over the Biden administration's handling of Israel's war against Hamas. According to a report by CNN, Harris had been scheduled to meet with the activists for 10 minutes Friday, but ended up speaking with them for 20 minutes, Wa'el Alzayat, CEO of the Muslim voter turnout group Emgage Action said. 'She pledged to work with our community, include our community, and that she completely understands what we’re saying. She is hopeful that if she wins, she’ll be able to deliver on all of this once she’s president.' Harris was quoted by Yedioth Aharonoth as saying that she remains 'interested in ending the war and will do everything in her power to achieve that.' Activists reportedly urged the vice president to 'distance herself from the Biden administration's pro-Israel policy and increase pressure to end the war in Gaza.' The Harris campaign is increasingly concerned that Muslim and Arab voters, traditionally strong backers of the Democratic party, could abandon the ticket in this November's election, in part due to frustration over the war in Gaza. The Uncommitted National Movement - an alliance of Arab, Muslim, and progressive voters - has threatened to back an alternative candidate in place of Harris, possibly Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Some in the battleground state of Michigan have even suggested backing Trump, arguing that a Trump victory would likely lead to a swift resolution of the Gaza war, rather than its protraction. Last month, Amer Ghalib, mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan, the only Muslim-majority city in America, called on locals to back former President Donald Trump. 'I believe he is the right choice for this critical time,' Ghalib said of Trump, praising him as a 'man of principles.'

Hamas chief has disappeared, claims Qatar	The Hamas leader has surrounded himself with hostages and communicates only by pen and paper in fear of an Israeli attack, they said. By World Israel News Staff Qatari officials who met with representatives of families whose loved ones are still being held hostage in Gaza told them that Hamas head Yahya Sinwar has gone silent and disappeared, Channel 12 reported Sunday evening. According to the report, Sharon Sharabi, who has two captive brothers, one known dead and one hopefully still alive, asked the Qatari officials what is the status of the negotiations and what has happened to Sinwar. Rumors of the arch-terrorist’s possible death have been circulating recently in the media, with nothing heard of him in several weeks. 'Right now, Sinwar isn’t communicating with us,' they answered, according to the report. 'He has disappeared from us as well, and has not made contact. He stopped using phones because of the assassinations, and is now communicating through pen and paper. It’s making things very difficult.' They added that they have no evidence that points to his death and believe Sinwar is surrounding himself with hostages to add another layer of protection to himself. A week ago, Channel 12 reported that at some point in the ongoing war, Israel had received 'gold-plated' intelligence information as to the whereabouts of the Hamas chief but did not make the attempt to assassinate him due to their concern that they also would accidentally kill hostages that he had around him. The Qataris blamed Israel for the breakdown in negotiations. They told the families, 'Israel instituted this policy of assassinations and it soured the deal. We used to have [Hamas political chief Ismail] Haniyeh, and he was eliminated. Now there’s Khaled Mashaal, and he is a lot tougher than Haniyeh.' The report noted that the families understand that they 'have to take the Qatari claims with a large grain of salt, due to the close ties' between Hamas and the oil-rich nation that has provided the Gazan terrorists with billions of dollars in support over the last decade and more. Despite the major ground operation the IDF began in Lebanon last week against Hezbollah, Israeli forces are still keeping up the military pressure against Hamas. Over the last 24 hours, the IAF hit a major command and control center in a former UNRWA site in Jabalya in the northern Gaza Strip, using the humanitarian center as cover for their military operations in contravention of international law. The IDF then announced Sunday that it surrounded Jabalya overnight due to 'intelligence information and &#8230; field operations that attested to the presence of terrorists and terrorist infrastructure in the area, as well as [Hamas] attempts to rebuild' there. IAF aircraft, it said, 'attacked dozens of military targets&#8230;including weapons storage sites, underground infrastructure, terrorist squads and other military infrastructure. The operation will continue as long as necessary, systematically hitting and destroying the terrorist infrastructure in the area.' The IDF had first called on civilians to flee the upcoming battle zone for their own safety. Hamas responded by commanding the residents not to comply with the demands of the IDF and leave for the humanitarian area of Al-Mawasi in the south. 'Do not respond to the occupation's threats to evacuate your homes,' the terrorist organization said.

Explainer: Why southern Lebanon is key to the Israel-Hezbollah co...	The key features of southern Lebanon are the Litani River and Beqaa Valley. By Pesach Benson, TPS The volatile region of southern Lebanon has long been a focal point in the ongoing Israel-Hezbollah conflict. Its proximity to northern Israel combined with terrain that is favorable for guerrilla warfare make the region a strategic asset for Hezbollah. From southern Lebanon, Israeli cities such as Haifa, Safed and Nahariya are well within range of Hezbollah rockets, while terrorists firing smaller anti-tank rockets strike fear in smaller communities near the border. Hezbollah maintains weapons storage sites, launchers, munitions factories, command centers and a network of tunnels throughout southern Lebanon. These are the Hezbollah assets Israel’s ground operation aims to remove while setting up a security zone. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, the Iran-backed terror group began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities, killing 49 people. According to figures released by the government on Sept. 29, more than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. To secure the return of the Israelis to their homes, officials have floated the idea of setting up a security zone in southern Lebanon. The Litani River and Beqaa Valley The key features of southern Lebanon are the Litani River and Beqaa Valley. 'The Litani River is a natural border,' Prof. Eyal Zisser, a vice-rector of Tel Aviv University and a senior research fellow at Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern Studies told The Press Service of Israel. The Litani, 140 km long, is Lebanon’s longest river, originating in eastern Lebanon near the city of Baalbek. The river follows the Beqaa Valley south before turning west and eventually reaching the Mediterranean near the city of Tyre. According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Hezbollah is forbidden from operating south of the Litani. Since the start of the ground war, the Israel Defense Forces has warned Lebanese not to drive south of the Litani River until further notice. 'There is intense fighting in southern Lebanon, in which Hezbollah operatives are using the civilian environment and you as a human shield to organize to carry out attacks,' tweeted Col. Avichay Adraee, the army’s Arabic-language spokesman, on Tuesday. 'For your safety, we ask you to avoid movement in vehicles from the north to the south of the Litani River.' The Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon lies between the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountain ranges. About 120 kilometers in length, the valley provides Hezbollah with easy access to Syria, and is a key land route for Iranian weapons smuggling. Israeli officials have indicated that cutting off Hezbollah’s arms supply would require entering Beqaa. The valley’s relatively flat terrain makes it an ideal area for Hezbollah to store heavy weaponry and maintain logistical hubs farther away from the Israeli border. At the same time, its agricultural productivity provides food and resources to Hezbollah. A Hezbollah Stronghold Since its founding in the early 1980s, Hezbollah has cultivated a strong base in the predominantly Shiite regions of southern Lebanon. The group has embedded itself within local communities, offering social services, building infrastructure, and providing security — instead of the Lebanese government. Moreover, TPS-IL has learned that Hezbollah has adopted what Christians describe as 'mafia tactics,' embedding its forces in Christian communities, stealing property and extorting business owners. 'For almost 20 years, Hezbollah groups have been systematically oppressing Christians in southern Lebanon, seizing homes and factories for use by Hezbollah members,' one southern Lebanese Christian told TPS-IL after evacuating to Beirut. Elias Zarina, a Jerusalem-based researcher and specialist in the Middle East’s Christian and other minority communities told TPS-IL, 'Hezbollah has been trying to take over the houses, forcing them to leave. Hezbollah’s goal is to take control of all of south Lebanon and store missiles inside private homes. The more property they control, the safer it is for Hezbollah figures to operate.' Regarding rocket launchers, Zarina — who is also the co-founder and community manager of the Jerusalemite Initiative, a Jerusalem-based non-profit that encourages Arab-speaking integration into Israeli society — explained, 'Hezbollah stores the trucks and launchers at a facility in, say Nabatieh. When they’re ready to fire, they show up in the village and choose a time to launch it.' Following its invasion of Lebanon in 1982, Israel maintained a security zone in southern Lebanon for nearly 20 years. Israeli forces abruptly withdrew in 2000 while Hezbollah remained. The Second War in Lebanon broke out in 2006 when Hezbollah killed eight soldiers and abducted two. UNSC Resolution 1701 That war ended when Israel and Hezbollah accepted UN Security Council resolution 1701. The resolution called for 'the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon' and stressed that southern Lebanon was to be demilitarized, the exception only Lebanese government forces and UNIFIL peacekeepers. No foreign force would operate in Lebanon without the government’s consent. But Hezbollah never disarmed or withdrew from 'the Blue Line,' as the Israel-Lebanon border is often called. The Lebanese government never extended its control over southern Lebanon. And Hezbollah’s foreign allies such as Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp and Hamas have openly operated there. Most of analysts TPS-IL talked to agreed that it would take anywhere from three weeks to three months for Israel to create a security zone in southern Lebanon to enable norther residents to return home. Professor Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies, told TPS-IL, 'We can’t allow another 11 months to deal with Hezbollah in the north,' Michael stressed. 'It needs to be done quicker.'

Pagers sold to Hezbollah were unknowingly booby-trapped in Israel...	Some 5,000 devices were set to explode by remote control or when two buttons were pressed, using both hands, to receive an encrypted message. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News The September 17 and 18 pagers explosions that maimed some 3,000 Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon and killed a few dozen was almost two years in the making, The Washington Post reported Sunday in an exclusive report. Citing unnamed American, Israeli and Lebanese security and other sources, the paper reported that in February 2023, a marketing agent who used to work for the Gold Apollo pagers company in the Middle East and then formed her own company to sell them and other beepers, convinced Hezbollah officials to make a bulk purchase of 5,000 devices. 'She was the one in touch with Hezbollah, and explained to them why the bigger pager with the larger battery was better than the original model,' said an Israeli official. Two major selling points of the AR924 model were their hard cases and their extra-long battery life, making them particularly suitable for months-long use in rugged conditions. Neither the Apollo company nor the unnamed marketing agent knew anything about the secret Israeli plan to assemble the devices themselves, inserting a battery pack with a tiny but powerful bomb inside and then slipping them into the shipment. The explosive was so well hidden that even if suspicious terrorists would take the devices apart – which Israeli officials believe at least some of them did, even perhaps X-raying them – it wouldn’t be found. The report quoted an Israeli official who explained that the pagers were rigged to explode when someone received a special, encrypted message that required him to press two buttons simultaneously, necessitating the use of two hands. The blast would then injure both, rendering the terrorist 'incapable' of fighting, the official said. Reports out of Lebanon at the time also said an unknown number of terrorists were blinded or killed as they held the pagers up to their faces to read the message they were supposedly about to receive. The pagers could also be set off remotely, which the Mossad did 'less than a minute' after the encrypted message enticed the first massive group to hold the devices, the report said. Some 2,000 others then exploded. Video clips uploaded to social media showed men being rushed to hospitals with injuries in the hip and stomach areas, consistent with the location such devices are usually carried about. The report noted that the hundreds of Hezbollah walkie talkies that exploded the next day, injuring many more terrorists, were actually booby-trapped by Israel and sold to the terrorists much earlier, in 2015. These specially-made two-way radios had a dual purpose. The first, which was how it was used for nine years, was its ability to let Israeli intelligence listen in on everything being said on the old-fashioned communication devices, giving the Mossad invaluable information on the most formidable enemy Israel had on its border. The second, like the pagers, was as an offensive weapon, as they, too, contained a small explosive hidden inside. Once the pagers were blown up, it was almost a given that the walkie talkies had to be detonated as well, since the Israelis would expect Hezbollah to make the logical move of ordering that its operatives should get rid of all their communication devices at least temporarily, as a precautionary move.

How will Israel respond to Iran ballistic missile attack?	Israel could target Iranian nuclear, oil assets; assassinating senior leaders also an option, according to reports. By World Israel News Staff Following last week's unprecedented direct attack by Iran, Israeli security officials are weighing possible options for a retaliatory strike against the Islamic Republic. Tehran launched some 200 ballistic missiles at military and intelligence bases in Israel, with some 25 of those projectiles failing to be intercepted by the Iron Dome air defense system. The Israeli military recently admitted that Iranian missiles struck several air forces bases, though the IDF spokesman stressed that the impacts had not affected operations, nor had aircraft sustained damage. Immediately following the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised speech that Iran had 'made a big mistake' by attacking, and that Tehran 'would pay' for sending some 9 million Israelis into bomb shelters. In a subsequent speech, Netanyahu hinted that Israel may assassinate top Iranian leaders, such as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameinei, as part of its retaliatory attack. 'When Iran is finally free — and that moment will come a lot sooner than people think – everything will be different,' Netanyahu said. The headquarters of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps or its presidential palace are also potential symbolic targets that could serve as a blow to the morale of the regime. Beyond killing Iranian government officials, there are a number of different targets that Israel could choose to restore its deterrence against Iran. According to a Ma'ariv report, the Israeli military is considering striking Iranian military assets, such as the sites from which the ballistic missiles were launched. An attack targeting Iran's oil production facilities and fields could also levy a defeating economic blow against Tehran. Israel could also leverage the momentum of the current moment to finally strike Iran's nuclear development sites. The Jewish State has been seeking international legitimacy for such a move for years. Washington has sent mixed messages regarding its support for an Israeli retaliatory strike on Iran. President Joe Biden recently said that Israel should avoid hitting Iran's oil or nuclear sites. He then urged Jerusalem to respond 'proportionately' to what is believed to be one of the largest ballistic missile attacks in history. Other White House officials have signaled that the U.S. would help Israel exact 'severe consequences' against Iran for the attack.

Report: Trump to visit Lubavitcher rebbe’s grave, join October 7t...	Former President Donald Trump reportedly planning to visit the grave of the Lubavitcher Rebbe on October 7th, before flying to Miami to address a memorial marking anniversary of the Hamas invasion. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Former President Donald Trump will address a gathering in Miami Monday, held in honor of the victims killed, wounded, or taken hostage during the Hamas invasion of southwestern Israel on October 7th, 2023, the Trump campaign has announced. The event, which also serves as a memorial to victims of antisemitic violence worldwide, is slated to be held at a hotel and golf club owned by the 45th president - the Trump National Doral Miami. In a statement released to the press, the Trump campaign said Israel's war against Hamas was part of a 'battle between the forces of good versus evil,' and railed against the ' inept and failed policies of the Harris-Biden Administration,' which the statement claimed 'enabled the Iranian-backed proxies that have sewn a path of death and destruction.' 'Since taking office, the Harris-Biden administration has enriched Iran, enabled the enemies of the United States, and compromised the security of our country.' The campaign also blamed the Biden White House for the surge in antisemitic incidents on college campuses across the country. 'Radical leftist antisemitism has spread across our city streets and college campuses, while the dangerously liberal Harris-Biden administration has willfully neglected this dire situation.' According to reports by ultra-Orthodox Jewish media outlets, former President Trump is also slated to visit the grave of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, better known as the Lubavitcher Rebbe. The COLlive website, which focuses on the Chabad - Lubavitch movement, cited a source claiming that the former president was considering such a visit Monday, on the anniversary of October 7th. A second outlet, Yeshiva World News, said that multiple sources had confirmed that Trump will in fact visit the rabbi's resting place in Queens, New York Monday, before flying to Miami for the October 7th memorial service. The report claimed that David Friedman, an attorney for Trump who later served as his Ambassador to Israel, had facilitated the visit. Secret Service agents have reportedly begun preparing for the visit, inspecting the grave site and the surrounding area. Last month, Argentinian President Javier Milei and Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama visited the grave. In 2020, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Trump's daughter and son-in-law, visited the grave ahead of the presidential election.

Lying EU official says ‘Israel is starving Gazans, blocking aid’	EU Foreign Policy head claims Netanyahu wants war with Iran, repeats debunked claims around starvation in Gaza. By World Israel News Staff An outgoing European Union official repeated false claims about the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, alleging that Israel prevents the entry of aid into the coastal enclave during an interview on Friday. Josep Borrell, the EU's High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, has repeatedly attack Israel since the October 7th Hamas massacres. 'I have seen warehouses and warehouses of humanitarian aid piled up, rotting, that cannot enter when on the other side of the fence there are two million people who are dying of hunger or diseases,' Borrell claimed to Spanish outlet Onda Cero. Borrell did not acknowledge the fact that Israel has permitted massive amounts of aid to enter the Strip since the beginning of the conflict, nor that much of the aid is stolen by Hamas terrorists and then sold for profit to Gazans. The politician also failed to acknowledge last week's murder of a humanitarian aid worker by Hamas terrorists. Prime Minister Benjamin 'Netanyahu should not go to the UN saying that [the IDF] is the most moral army in the world' when Gazans are struggling with food insecurity, Borrell added. Borrell maintained that Israel should not respond to last Tuesday's Iranian attack, which saw Tehran fire some 200 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State. 'Netanyahu wants a conflict, and he wants to start it from a position of strength,' Borrell declared, ignoring Iran's non-stop attacks on Israel via its proxy groups since October 7th. He also ignored Iran's previous attack on Israel in April, to which Jerusalem did not retaliate. 'This cycle of attacks risks [risks] fueling an uncontrollable regional escalation,' Borrell tweeted shortly after the missile barrage, which sent some 9 million Israelis into bomb shelters. 'We call on all parties to exert maximum restraint,' he added.

Defiant Khamenei says Israel ‘won’t last long’	Iran's Supreme Leader praises October 7th massacres, claims Israel will be destroyed soon. By World Israel News Staff Following Iran's unprecedented direct attack on Israel, which saw the launch of some 200 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei gave a speech on Friday striking a defiant tone. Khamenei began his first public speech in five years by praising the October 7th Hamas massacres, which included acts of brutality including the murder of babies and the elderly and the mass rape of women. The onslaught was 'logical and legal,' Khamenei contended, praising the anti-Israel 'axis of resistance,' which includes Hamas and the Lebanon-based Iranian proxy group Hezbollah. 'The resistance in the region will not back down with these martyrdoms, and will win,' Khamenei said, acknowledging the recent assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. 'Israel will never defeat Hamas and Hezbollah,' he said. Speaking about the missile attack against Israel on Tuesday night, Khamenei claimed that what Iran 'did was the minimum punishment for the crimes of the usurping Zionist regime.' The 85-year-old added that Israel is a 'malicious regime' which has 'only kept itself standing by the injection of American support.' The Islamic leader pledged that Israel 'will not last long.' In a speech last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the Iranian people, saying that the Israeli government's conflict was with the Iranian regime, rather than its citizens. One remark by Netanyahu triggered speculation that Israel may be planning to assassinate Khamenei and other senior leaders. 'When Iran is finally free — and that moment will come a lot sooner than people think – everything will be different,' Netanyahu said. 'Our two ancient peoples, the Jewish people and the Persian people, will finally be at peace. Our two countries, Israel and Iran, will be at peace. Israel has vowed to respond 'forcefully' to the Iranian attack, which marked the second time that Iran has directly attacked Israel this year.

Trump says Israel should hit Iran’s nuclear facility first ‘and w...	When asked if Israel should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, Biden answered, 'No.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Criticizing US President Biden's statements at the G7 conference that Israel should refrain from striking Iran's nuclear facilities, former President and Republican candidate Donald Trump said Israel should 'hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later.' At a campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, Trump ridiculed Biden's earlier remarks by saying,' 'As long as they don't hit the nuclear stuff.' That's the thing you wanna hit, right? I said, 'I think he's got that one wrong. Isn't that what you're supposed to hit?'' He added that nuclear weapons are 'the biggest threat we have.' Trump said, 'His answer should have been 'Hit the nuclear first, worry about the rest later.'' On Wednesday, Biden was attending the G7 conference, joining leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom, and was asked about how Israel should respond to Iran's launch of 200 missiles into Israel on Tuesday. When asked if Israel should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, Biden answered, 'No.' The US President said he was talking to Israeli officials about a response and would soon speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One, 'Biden expressed the United States's full solidarity and support to Israel and its people and reaffirmed the United States's commitment to Israel's security,' she said. Speaking to Fox News on Thursday, Trump said Biden's response regarding Israel refraining from bombing Iran's nuclear facilities as the 'craziest thing I've ever heard. That's the biggest risk we have. The biggest risk we have is nuclear.' He continued, 'I mean, to make the statement, 'Please leave their nuclear alone.' I would tell you that that's not the right answer. That was the craziest answer because you know what? Soon, they're going to have nuclear weapons. And then you're going to have problems.'

8 Israeli troops killed in Lebanon in first Israeli casualties of...	The army has said that its incursion is meant to be limited. The ground troops’ mission is to destroy Hezbollah arms depots close to the border along with its tunnel systems. By Ron Kampeas, JTA In the first casualties in Lebanon since Israel launched a ground incursion this week, eight Israeli soldiers were killed in clashes with Hezbollah fighters. The army said Wednesday that six soldiers were killed in one clash and that two were killed in another. Israeli sent ground troops into Lebanon on Monday night for the first time since 2006, in a bid to further degrade Hezbollah and distance it from the border following a year of cross-border missile fire that the terror group started on Oct. 8 of last year, following Hamas’ attack the previous day. In recent weeks Israel has destroyed much of Hezbollah’s infrastructure and killed its top leadership, including its longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, in air strikes. More than 1,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in the strikes. The army has said that its incursion is meant to be limited. The ground troops’ mission is to destroy Hezbollah arms depots close to the border along with its tunnel systems. Israel’s 1982-2000 occupation of southern Lebanon, meant to deter attacks on northern Israel became massively unpopular, spurred the rise of Hezbollah, and cost hundreds of Israeli lives. Israel fought another war against Hezbollah in 2006 after the group kidnapped two Israeli soldiers. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently added to Israel’s war aims the return of civilians to their homes on the northern border. The other war aims are the destruction of Hamas in Gaza and the return of the hostages that terrorist group still holds captive there. The conflict on the northern front kept to a simmer for months after last October, although it led to the evacuation of tens of thousands of Israeli and Lebanese civilians living along the border, and killed dozens of civilians in both countries. Hundreds of Hezbollah operatives and approximately 20 Israeli soldiers were also killed before the conflict escalated in recent weeks.

Khamenei urged Nasrallah to flee days before he was assassinated	Iranian sources said the confusion within the ranks of Hezbollah, IRGC, and the Iranian government due to alleged Israeli infiltration is interfering with the functioning of Iran's Axis of Resistance. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned the late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah about Israeli infiltration within Hezbollah and urged him to flee to Iran to evade assassination, Reuters reports. This warning was issued days before Nasrallah was killed in a strike in Beirut and was conveyed through a messenger, senior Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) commander, Brigadier General Abbas Nilforoushan, who was killed along with Nasrallah in the September 27th strike. Three Iranian sources reported that Khamenei warned that Israeli operatives within Hezbollah were plotting to kill Nasrallah and that he also expressed concerns about possible Israeli infiltration within government ranks in Tehran. Khamenei, who remains in a secure location, ordered the launch of 200 missiles into Israel on Thursday as retaliation for the death of Nasrallah and Nilforoushan and additionally for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. However, Israel has not claimed responsibility for the latter strike. Reuters reported that 10 Iranian sources confirmed the confusion and loss of trust within the ranks of Hezbollah, IRGC, and the Iranian government due to fears of Israeli infiltration within their ranks and said the situation is interfering with the functioning of Iran's Axis of Resistance. The strike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah required long-term planning and coordination of 'precise intelligence,' according to the IDF. The afternoon operation was carried out by fighter jets that targeted Hezbollah's 'central headquarters,' which were 'embedded under a residential building' in a suburb of Beirut. This area has long been a stronghold of the Lebanese terror group. Nasrallah assumed the leadership of Hezbollah 30 years ago. He was responsible, with the help of Iran, for the growth of the terror group to one of the largest non-state militaries in the region. . In a statement Saturday, Israeli Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said Nasrallah's killing proved that 'anyone who threatens the citizens of Israel — we will know how to reach them.' Brig.-Gen. Amichai Levine, the newly appointed commander of Hatzerim Airbase, said the mission to eliminate Nasrallah required the Israeli Air Force's unique, world-class capabilities.

Nasrallah’s successor presumed dead	A Lebanese security said the chances of surviving such a strike were 'almost zero' and that Safieddine had been 'unreachable' since Friday. An Israeli security source on Saturday told Sky News Arabic that Hashem Safieddine, the successor and cousin of dead Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, is presumed dead along with other terrorists following a strike on Friday night. After a strike in Southern Beirut, Safieddine was assumed to have been severely injured in an area underground where it would have been difficult to escape alive. A Lebanese security official told Sky News Arabic that the chances of surviving such a strike were 'almost zero' and that Safieddine had been 'unreachable' since Friday. The Saudi news organization Al Hadath reported that Safieddine was dead on Saturday morning, but other media outlets have not yet confirmed the report. It has been reported that the strikes were intended to target a meeting between Safieddine and other Hezbollah terrorists. The repeated strikes in the Dahiyeh suburb of Beirut have prevented rescue workers from examining the area and determining whether or not Safieddine has been killed. Safieddine, a maternal cousin of Nasrallah, was a cleric who wore a black turban, indicating direct descent from Mohammed. As head of the executive council, Safieddine was in charge of the political affairs of the terror group. He also had a seat on the Judicial Council, which controls military operations. The U.S. State Department designated Hashem Safieddine as a terrorist in 2017. He had strong ties with Iran and completed religious studies in Qom. Safieddine's son is married to the daughter of IRGC General Qasem Soleimani, who was killed in a 2020 airstrike in Iraq. At the funeral of a Hezbollah commander, Safieddine threatened Israel when he exclaimed, 'Let [the enemy] prepare himself to cry and wail.' He has expressed strong solidarity with the Palestinian cause and its struggle with Israel. At an event in Dahiyeh in Beirut, he said, 'Our history, guns, and rockets are with you.' In a speech in Beirut in July, Safieddine discussed Hezbollah'sHezbollah's view of succession when he said, 'In our resistance… when any leader is martyred, another takes up the flag and goes on with new, certain, strong determination.'

IDF destroys Hezbollah terror assets as Lebanon ground op ramps u...	The military has killed some 400 terrorists since officially launching the ground operation in Southern Lebanon on Monday. By JNS Israel Defense Forces ground troops on Saturday continued to press forward with operations in Southern Lebanon, destroying Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure including observation posts, underground weapons caches and rocket launching sites. IDF commandos and soldiers from the Combat Engineering Corp’s Yahalom special operations unit also destroyed Hezbollah tunnel shafts used by terrorists to approach the Israeli border. The military has killed some 400 terrorists since officially launching the ground operation in Southern Lebanon on Monday. Meanwhile, IDF air defenses on Saturday downed a suspected drone fired from Lebanon towards the Western Galilee border kibbutz of Adamit, triggering sirens in the area. Earlier, Hezbollah claimed to have fired Fadi-1 rockets at the IDF’s Ramat David Airbase near Haifa. The projectiles were either intercepted or hit in open areas, the military said. The Iranian terrorist proxy also fired a barrage of five rockets at northern Israel, setting off air-raid sirens across the Jezreel Valley, including in Nazareth, and the Wadi Ara area. There were no immediate reports of injuries. לוחמי צוות הקרב של עוצבת הקומנדו ממשיכים לפעול בדרום לבנון במסגרת פעילות קרקעית ממוקדת בכפר שחלקים נרחבים מתשתיותיו הוסבו למטרות טרור של ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה>> pic.twitter.com/nraEdbBbop &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) October 5, 2024 Overnight Friday, the IDF conducted a 'precise' strike on a Hezbollah command center located in a mosque in Bint Jbeil, within a larger hospital compound. Hezbollah was using the site 'to plan and carry out terrorist acts against IDF troops and the State of Israel,' said the military. pic.twitter.com/JWivlR5Z9w &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) October 4, 2024 Before the strike, the IDF sent text messages to local residents and called Lebanese officials, 'demanding that all acts of terror carried out at the hospital cease immediately.' 'The IDF has made great efforts to prevent harming uninvolved civilians, despite the cynical use by the Hezbollah terrorist organization of civilian infrastructure, including essential buildings, for perpetrating terrorism,' added the IDF. כלי טיס של חיל האוויר תקפו במהלך הלילה, באופן ממוקד ובהכוונה מודיעינית של אמ'ן ופיקוד הצפון, פעילים של ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה שפעלו במפקדה שהוקמה במסגד סמוך לבית חולים 'צלאח ע'נדור' שבדרום לבנון>> pic.twitter.com/T7lVo7XvFw &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) October 5, 2024 Also overnight, Saeed Atallah, a leader of Hamas’s terrorist army, the al-Qassam Brigades, was killed in an Israeli strike on a Palestinian camp in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli, Reuters reported, citing Hamas-linked media. On Thursday, the IDF confirmed that an Israeli Air Force strike three months ago killed Hamas’s de facto prime minister in the Gaza Strip. Rawhi Mushtaha was targeted along with senior terrorists Sameh al-Siraj and Sami Odeh, who both held security portfolios in Hamas’s 'political' bureau, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Also on Thursday, an IAF strike in Beirut targeted an underground bunker where Hashem Safieddine and other top Hezbollah terrorists were meeting. The fate of Safieddine, a maternal cousin of slain terror master Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah’s Executive Council and a leading candidate to replace Nasrallah, is not yet clear. The IDF announced on Wednesday that the 36th Division was joining the 98th Paratrooper Division in the fight against Hezbollah in Lebanon. 'The 36th Division, including soldiers of the Golani Brigade, 188th Armored Brigade, 6th Infantry Brigade and additional forces are joining the limited, localized, targeted raids on Hezbollah terror targets and terrorist infrastructure in Southern Lebanon that began on Monday,' the army said. Jerusalem has escalated its offensive on Hezbollah since adding the return of evacuated Israeli civilians to the north as an official war goal on Sept. 17. Hezbollah has attacked Israel nearly daily since Oct. 8, 2023, firing some 10,000 rockets, missiles and drones. The attacks have killed more than 40 people and caused widespread damage. Tens of thousands of Israeli civilians remain internally displaced due to the ongoing violence.

Names released of 5 people killed by terrorist shooting at Yaffa ...	The victims named are 42-year-old Ilya Nozadze, 24-year-old Revital Bronstein, 33-year-old Inbar Segev Vigdar, 40-year-old Nadia Sokolenko and 30-year-old Shahar Goldman. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The names of five of the seven people killed by terrorist shooters at the Yaffa rail station on Tuesday night were released. The victims named are 42-year-old Ilya Nozadze, 24-year-old Revital Bronstein, 33-year-old Inbar Segev Vigdar, 40-year-old Nadia Sokolenko and 30-year-old Shahar Goldman. Two terrorist shooters attacked passengers, killing seven and wounding dozens. Two of the five murdered in the attack have not been named, and an additional three are in serious condition. Inbar Segev Vigdar, who owned a Pilates and fitness studio in Tel Aviv, was at the train station with her 9-month-old infant, who was unharmed and taken to safety. Witnesses reported that Vigdar shielded the baby with her body, saving his life. Eric Marchenkov, who was wounded in the attack, said, 'The mother hugged her baby. This was the most powerful picture of a mother hugging her baby covered in blood. It is a miracle that the baby is alive from all the bullets that were flying there. The mother was hit, but he survived.' A passenger told Ynet, '[Segev Vigdar] went to get off the train and was shot. We heard the baby screaming. We pulled him out of the carrier. One of the policemen took me and the baby in a van to Wolfson [Hospital].' Inbar Segev Vigdar is survived also by her husband Yaari Vigdar, who fought in the reserves in Gaza and the north. Yaari Vigdar said that when his wife did not answer, he rode his bicycle to the station. 'After a thorough search, I found our dog shot while passers-by were taking care of her. I looked for Inbar in the whole neighborhood and realized that I had to go to the hospital because I didn't get a response from anywhere.' He went to the hospital and saw his 9-month-old son in the arms of a doctor. Shahar Goldman was from Lod and is survived by her husband, Tai, her sisters Astar, Dikla, and Merav, and her parents, Avraham and Ruth Goldman. Revital Bronstein was from Bat Yam, was working on her master's degree in computer science and won awards for her work in artificial intelligence. Nadia Sokalenko was a stylist from Tel Aviv and is survived by her husband Vadim a six-year-old daughter named Maya. She also has relatives living in Moldova and Denmark. Ilya Nozadze was a truck driver from Georgia and was taken to the hospital with three bullets in his chest. His wife and two children, 17 and 14, live in Georgia. The two terrorist shooters were identified as Mohammed Ragev and Hassin Tamimi, two illegal residents from Hebron. One of the terrorists was armed with an M-16 and the other with a knife, and they began attacking people on the light rail.

On same day Iran fires 200 ballistic missiles at Jewish state, US...	Hashomer Yosh, a nonprofit, has said that it does not engage in violence and that the U.S. sanctions are based on false information. By JNS On the same day that Iran fired some 200 ballistic missiles at the Jewish state and two Palestinian terrorists killed seven people in Tel Aviv-Jaffa, the U.S. State Department announced sanctions against two Israelis in Judea and Samaria whom Foggy Bottom accused of 'undermining peace, security and stability in the West Bank.' The State Department said the two are 'a violent Israeli settler and the CEO and director of U.S.-designated Hashomer Yosh.' 'The actions of these individuals have contributed to creating an environment where violence and instability thrive,' Foggy Bottom stated. 'Their actions, collectively and individually, undermine peace, security and stability in the West Bank.' (The Biden administration refers to part of Judea and Samaria as the 'West Bank.') Hashomer Yosh, a nonprofit, has said that it does not engage in violence and that the U.S. sanctions are based on false information. The U.S. Treasury Department identified the two Israelis as Eitan Yardeni and Avichai Suissa. It also designated Hilltop Youth, which the State Department said is 'a violent extremist group that has rampaged through Palestinian communities in the West Bank.' 'It has carried out killings, mass arson and other so-called ‘price tag’ attacks to exact revenge and intimidate Palestinian civilians,' the State Department said. 'Hilltop Youth has repeatedly clashed with the Israeli military when it tries to counter Hilltop Youth’s destructive activities.' The Biden administration called on the Israeli government to 'take action and hold violent actors, like those designated today, accountable.' It added that 'we will continue to use our tools to promote accountability for violence that threatens peace and stability in the region, no matter the national origin, ethnicity, race or religion of the perpetrators of such violence.' 'The worsening violence and instability in the West Bank are detrimental to the long-term interests of Israelis and Palestinians, and the actions of violent organizations like Hilltop Youth only exacerbate the crisis,' stated Bradley Smith, acting under secretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence. 'The United States will continue to hold accountable the individuals, groups and organizations that facilitate these hateful and destabilizing acts,' Smith stated. The State Department sent a fact sheet and press release on the sanctions to reporters hours after every civilian in Israel sheltered as the Islamic Republic bombed the Jewish state, the Israeli military said. David Milstein, who advised Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s presidential campaign and worked for David Friedman, then-U.S. ambassador to Israel, wrote when the Treasury Department first announced the sanctions that they came 'as Israel is fighting a war of survival against Iran and its terror proxies on seven fronts, and on the same day Iran is poised to launch another major escalatory attack from Iranian soil.' 'The Biden-Harris administration has shamefully abused sanctions authority to impose more illegitimate sanctions on Israeli organizations,' he wrote. 'This is truly reprehensible.'

Only fatality from mass Iranian missile attack is Palestinian man...	In April, during Iran’s first direct missile attack on the Jewish state, Amina Alhasoni, a seven-year-old girl from a Bedouin village in the Negev, was the one wounded by an Iranian missile. By The Algemeiner A Palestinian man in the West Bank village of Nu’eima, near Jericho was killed by falling fuselage from an intercepted missile during a massive Iranian missile attack against Israel, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The man, Sameh Asli, 37, a Palestinian from Jabalia in Gaza, is currently the only reported death from the Iranian attack against Israel. Israeli rescue services said that only two people were lightly wounded by shrapnel in Tel Aviv amid the Iranian missile attack, while several others were treated for minor injuries after falling over while running or for acute anxiety. In April, during Iran’s first direct missile attack on the Jewish state, Amina Alhasoni, a seven-year-old girl from a Bedouin village in the Negev, was critically wounded by an Iranian missile. In July, she was released from Soroka Medical Center in Beersheva. Alhasoni was the only severely injured Israeli in the April barrage. Iran fired a salvo of ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday, forcing the Jewish state’s entire civilian population to take cover in bomb shelters. 'A short time ago missiles were launched from Iran into the territory of the State of Israel,' a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. 'You are asked to be vigilant and act exactly according to the instructions of the Home Front Command. The IDF is doing and will do everything necessary to protect the citizens of the State of Israel.' The IDF posted on X/Twitter that 'all Israeli civilians' were sheltering from the Iranian attack. Alarms sounded across Israel and explosions could be heard in Jerusalem and the Jordan River valley. Reuters journalists reported seeing missiles being intercepted in the airspace of neighboring Jordan. According to Israeli authorities, more than 180 missiles had been launched into Israel from Iran. 'The air-defense system is fully operational, detecting and intercepting threats wherever necessary, even at this moment,' said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the IDF spokesman. 'However, the defense is not hermetic.' Israel’s military later said Israelis were free to leave their shelters. 'Following the situational assessment, it was decided that it is now permitted to leave protected spaces in all areas across the country,' the military said. Iran had initially vowed to retaliate for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in late July. The Israeli government has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the assassination, although the Iranian regime blamed Jerusalem. It was widely expected that Iran would launch a direct attack on Israel; however, no such attack ever came. Then Iran said it would retaliate following Israeli airstrikes over the last two weeks that killed the top leaders of its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon, including longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Iranian commander Abbas Nilforoushan was also killed in the same strike as Nasrallah.

Israel preparing ‘powerful’ response to Iran’s attack – report	One senior official said Israel has 'full legitimacy for an unprecedented strike on Iranian soil.' By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel is preparing a 'powerful' response to the direct attack Tuesday night in which Iran launched more than 180 ballistic missiles at the Jewish state, government and IDF officials said after the attack was successfully thwarted. The IDF said Tuesday night that it would carry out 'powerful airstrikes throughout the Middle East' after Chief of Staff Maj.Gen. Herzi Halevi had said more vaguely, 'We will choose when to exact the price and prove our precise and unexpected attack capabilities.' The threat could be read in several ways. According to a Tuesday report in The Wall Street Journal, Tehran had warned Jerusalem in advance via Arab intermediaries what its attack would be, and Jerusalem had responded with the message that it would react with a 'direct hit' on such strategic assets in Iran as its nuclear or gas facilities for the smallest damage caused by the missiles. Two people were lightly hurt by falling shrapnel, several others were injured while running to safe areas, and damage was recorded in several locations, including about a hundred homes that were damaged in Hod Hasharon by the missiles. Unnamed Israeli officials are talking tough, with one saying 'Israel has full legitimacy for an unprecedented strike on Iranian soil—this is the time to strike at the head of the Iranian snake.' Ynet reported that the possibility of striking Iran’s nuclear facilities is 'now on the table of the decision-makers more than at any other point in the last decade.' It can be assumed, however, that the Americans would be completely against such a move, deeming it too much of an escalation that would cause an all-out war with Iran, something that they have repeatedly warned against. Hitting Iran’s oil and gas industry, whose products are the only export that is keeping the Islamic Republic’s economy afloat, would also fit the definition of the 'severe response' an Israeli defense official said was in the works. A limited versus an overwhelming strike may get the green light from the Biden administration, which has promised to cooperate with Israel on some kind of retaliation after the president and vice-president 'unequivocally condemned' Iran for the attack. Remaining vague, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told a press briefing after the missile strike that 'We have made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case.' Haaretz reported Wednesday that while a political decision has yet to be made as to any military response due to the need to coordinate with the U.S., Israel will be demanding that the global community immediately deepen Iran's international isolation, declare the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist organization and impose crippling economic sanctions on the country.

Iran’s Ayatollah and Dutch lawmaker spar – in Hebrew	Leader of the Netherlands' largest political party excoriates Iran's supreme leader in a Hebrew tweet, after Iran launches massive ballistic missile barrage at Israel. By World Israel News Staff A senior Dutch lawmaker ripped Iran's supreme leader Tuesday in Hebrew, hours after the Shi'ite cleric posted his own message in Hebrew, following the Islamic republic's massive ballistic missile attack on Israel. Geert Wilders, founder of the Party for Freedom (PVV) and leader of the party's delegation in the Dutch House of Representatives, took aim at Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Tuesday night, penning a riposte in Hebrew via X/Twitter, after Khamenei published a message lauding terror attacks against Israel. On Tuesday, Iranian forces launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel, the second major direct strike by Iran on the Jewish state, following a combination ballistic missile and drone attack in April. A majority of the incoming missiles were either shot down or landed in open areas, with the single fatality, a Palestinian construction worker, occuring in the Palestinian Authority city of Jericho. Shortly after the attack, Khamenei, the 85-year-old spiritual leader and head of state of Iran, published a comment on his X/Twitter account in Hebrew. 'With God's help,' Khamenei wrote, 'the blows of the uprising front will become stronger and more painful on the worn and rotting body of the Zionist regime.' An hour later, Wilders responded in kind, penning a Hebrew retort on X/Twitter. 'You are a psychopath, a dangerous maniac, a sick person who will lose because logic, democracy and freedom will win and we will always support Israel.' Wilders, a long-time critic of multiculturalism and large-scale Islamic immigration to the Netherlands, has long expressed support of Israel, having visited the country dozens of times and living in the Jewish state for several years in his youth.

Survey: Strong US backing for Israeli military action against Ira...	A total of 56% want to maintain U.S. military action at the same level, while 27% want to increase it and 17% want to decrease American military action. By JNS Three-quarters of Americans want to maintain or strengthen U.S. support for Israel’s military actions against Iran’s proxies, even as the U.S. administration pushes a ceasefire, according to a survey released on Monday. The polling comes as Israel’s war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon, triggered by Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre, approaches its one-year mark. Some 50% of Americans want to keep support for Israel’s military efforts against Iranian proxies at about the same level, while 25% each want to either increase or decrease the backing, according to the survey, commissioned by the non-partisan New York-based Council for a Secure America. Fifty-four percent of Americans agree that Iran and its allies, including Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen pose a direct threat to the United States and its Western allies, while 36% neither agree or disagree, and 10% disagree, the survey found. At the same time, most Americans want to maintain the current level of U.S. military action against both Iran and its proxies, which has been primarily defensive, the poll found. A total of 56% want to maintain U.S. military action at the same level, while 27% want to increase it and 17% want to decrease American military action. Overall, 62% of Americans feel that the United States’ relationship with Israel is important, with the highest support being found among older Americans and the lowest among 'Generation Z'; only 9% felt that the ties between the two countries are not important, the survey showed. 'As we approach the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 massacre and the ensuing war with Iran’s proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah, American support for Israel’s military actions remains strong,' said CSA executive director Jennifer Sutton. 'A majority of American voters feel that both Israel and the United States should continue their military efforts, and that Iran and its proxies pose a direct threat to the U.S. and our allies in the region,' the statement continued. The survey was conducted from Sept. 18 through Sept. 20 by Morning Consult, after the pager and walkie-talkie attacks against Hezbollah attributed to Israel but before the Israeli assassination of Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah. It cited a margin of error of 2%.

Iran’s attack on Israel tops Walz-Vance vice presidential debate	You can't ignore October 7th' - Tim Walz warns 'fickle' Trump not capable of demonstrating the 'stability' needed to deal with Iranian threat, as JD Vance blasts Biden administration for unfreezing billions in Iranian assets. By World Israel News Staff Democratic Vice Presidential nominee and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz wrangled over Middle Eastern foreign policy with his Republican counterpart, Ohio Senator and 2024 Vice Presidential hopeful J.D. Vance, in a debate hosted by CBS News in New York City Tuesday night. Coming just hours after Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israel Tuesday, the vice presidential debate opened with questions regarding America's position vis-a-vis an Israeli strike on Iran. Both Walz and Vance highlighted October 7th in the opening of their responses, with Walz emphasizing the need for the U.S. to maintain 'steady leadership' in the region and to work with 'our Israeli partners and our coalition.' Trump, Walz accused, is temperamentally unfit to hold 'the coalitions together,' while lauding the Biden administration, crediting its support for Israel in the downing of many of the ballistic missiles launched Tuesday, saying the U.S.-aligned coalition was 'able to stop the incoming attack.' 'When our allies see Donald Trump turn towards Vladimir Putin, turn towards North Korea, when we start to see that type of fickleness around holding the coalitions together, we will stay committed?' Vance, in turn, appeared to blame the Biden administration for both the October 7th invasion of Israel and Tuesday's ballistic missile strikes, linking them to sanctions waivers granted by President Joe Biden and to billions of Iranian assets unfrozen by the White House. 'Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration,' Vance said. 'What do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies and, God forbid, potentially launching against the United States as well.' 'You can't ignore October the 7th, which I appreciate Governor Walz bringing up. But when did Iran and Hamas and their proxies attack Israel? It was during the administration of Kamala Harris.'

‘World War 3’ – Trump blames Iran attacks on Biden, Harris	Former President Donald Trump says White House 'enriched, empowered' Tehran, 'enabling Iran and its terror proxies' to carry out attacks on Israel and US targets. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Former President Donald Trump blamed the Biden administration Tuesday for a massive Iranian missile attack at Israel, accusing the White House of 'enabling' Tehran and its terrorist proxies. On Tuesday, nearly 200 ballistic missiles were launched from Iran towards Israel, forcing millions of Israelis into bomb shelters. While the attacks caused some damage across the country, only one fatality, an Arab construction worker in the Palestinian Authority city of Jericho, was reported, with two Israelis and two Jordanians injured by shrapnel. Shortly after the attacks, Trump spoke at a campaign rally in Wisconsin, blaming the Biden administration and its handling of Middle Eastern foreign policy for the attacks. 'Iran just launched 181 missiles at Israel, and I've been talking about World War III for a long time,' Trump said. 'The world right now is spiraling out of control. A short time ago, Iran launched over 200 ballistic missiles at Israel and we are closer than ever to global catastrophe.' 'We have a non-existent president and our Vice President, who should be in charge, is going to fundraisers in San Francisco and staging fake photo ops using phones that are not even connected. No one is in charge and it’s not even clear who is more confused: Biden or Kamala.' 'Neither has any idea what is going on.' Later on Tuesday, Trump issued a statement condemning President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for the sanctions waivers granted to Iran, linking them to Tuesday's attack. 'When I was President, Iran was in total check,' said Trump. 'They were starved for cash, fully contained, and desperate to make a deal. Kamala flooded them with American cash and, ever since, they’ve been exporting terror all over, and unraveling the Middle East.' 'Under 'President Trump,' we had NO WAR in the Middle East, NO WAR in Europe, and Harmony in Asia, No Inflation, No Afghanistan Catastrophe. Instead, we had PEACE.' 'Now, War or the threat of War, is raging everywhere, and the two Incompetents running this Country are leading us to the brink of World War III. You wouldn’t trust Joe or Kamala to run a lemonade stand, let alone lead the Free World.'

US National Security Adviser calls Iran’s attack against Israel ‘...	Sullivan: 'We have made clear that there will be severe consequences for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Following Iran's launch of 200 missiles into Israel on Tuesday, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan called the attack a 'significant escalation.' He added, 'We have made clear that there will be consequences, severe consequences, for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case,' said Sullivan. As sirens were sounded off all over the country and Israeli residents were told to shelter in place, there were no reported casualties from the massive attack. Sullivan characterized Iran's offensive as 'defeated and ineffective.' Sullivan reported that 'US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defense units in firing interceptors to shoot down' some 200 'inbound missiles.' The previous Iranian attack against Israel was in April, just a few days before Passover. Iran vowed to strike Israel again and threatened that if the US defended Israel, They would target American military bases. Iran's mission to the United Nations wrote on X, 'Should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue.' Iranian officials said that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered the attacks against Israel in retaliation for the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and other key terrorists in an airstrike in Beirut last Friday, as well as the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July. However, Israel has not claimed responsibility for the killing of Haniyeh. Khamenei deviated from this usual protocol and issued a direct threat against the Jewish State on his X account, vowing that there would be additional attacks and each 'will become stronger and more painful on the worn and rotting body of the Zionist regime.' On Monday night, the IDF entered southern Lebanon for the first time since the 2006 Lebanon War. As Iran attacked Israel on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden reported that he 'convened our national security team to discuss' the situation. Sullivan reported that Biden and Harris 'monitored the attack and the response from the White House Situation Room.'

IDF raids foiled Hezbollah plot for an Oct 7th-style invasion of ...	The IDF discovered maps Hezbollah provided to its terrorists as part of a plan to occupy Galilee. By David Isaac, JNS The Israel Defense Forces revealed on Tuesday that it had carried out dozens of secret ground operations into Southern Lebanon over the past year to reduce Hezbollah’s war-making capability, destroying the terror group’s tunnels and hidden weapons caches. The raids were part of an effort to prepare for the larger ground operation, which got underway this morning. The goal was to cripple Hezbollah’s ability to invade Israel. IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told press that IDF forces discovered more details of Hezbollah’s plan to invade northern Israel, which was to be spearheaded by the group’s Radwan Force. Israel killed Ibrahim Aqil, the head of the terror group’s special operations unit, on Sept. 20. Holding up a map, Hagari said: 'We found this map inside one of the compounds that our fighters raided. It is a map that Hezbollah planned to give to its terrorists during a broad infiltration into the territory of the State of Israel as part of the ‘Plan to occupy the Galilee.’ ' 'As you can see, it has a legend marking Israeli settlements, IDF posts, access roads and attack targets that Hezbollah planned to conquer. This map was supposed to be used by thousands of Hezbollah terrorists on the day of the order to raid the territory of the State of Israel, as Hamas did on Oct. 7,' he said. Hagari also detailed three IDF raids into Southern Lebanon, including the villages of Meiss El Jabal, Kfarkela and Ayta ash Shab. In Ayta ash Shab, soldiers found dozens of underground shafts and tunnels to a depth of 20 to 25 meters (65 to 83 feet), rocket launchers and more than 10 ammunition stores. In Meiss El Jabal, soldiers entered the houses of the village, where they found an ammunition depot for an entire company of Radwan terrorists in a 12-meter-deep shaft just 30 meters (98 feet) from the border with Israel. Weapons stores were meant for future use in the planned invasion of Northern Israel, Hagari said. Terrorist infrastructure was destroyed by a combination of ground demolitions and air attacks. Some of the raids took Israeli forces 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) into Lebanon, but most were a distance of two to three kilometers (1.2 to 1.8 miles) from Israel’s border. Israeli forces would sometimes spend a few days in enemy territory. But their work was carried out in secret, unchallenged by Hezbollah terrorists, according to the IDF.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Following Iran's launch of 181 missiles throughout Israel on Tuesday, Israeli officials said that the Islamic State will pay a steep price for the escalation. Israel's Military Chief of Staff, Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi issued a statement after a security assessment of the situation. 'We proved our capability to prevent the enemy from succeeding by combining exemplary civil behavior and a powerful air defense system,' he said. 'We will choose when to exact the price and prove our precise and unexpected attack capabilities in accordance with the will of the political sphere,' Halevi added. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said, 'This attack will have consequences. We have plans. We will act where and when we decide. We are in a high state of readiness for defense and offense - we will defend the citizens of the State of Israel.' Despite sirens sounding off all over the country, there were no reported casualties 'thanks to the responsible conduct of the public,' Hagari said. 'We ask not to give information to the enemy and not to publish footage from areas struck by missiles,' he added. Following the attack, Cultural and Sports Minister Miki Zohar said that 'the foolish Iranian leader who made the worst decision in its history will pay a very heavy price. This is the beginning of the end of the cursed Iranian regime.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich added, 'Like Gaza, Hezbollah, and the state of Lebanon, Iran will regret this moment.' National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir called for 13,000 emergency squad volunteers be deployed throughout the country. A US official told Kan News, 'A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will result in severe consequences for Iran.' 'We are in the midst of a campaign against the axis of evil of Iran. These are days of great achievements and great challenges,' they continued.

By Pesach Benson, TPS Two Palestinian terrorists were killed in a shootout during a counterterror operation in the Balata refugee camp in Shechem (Nablus), the Israel Defense Forces said on Tuesday. The army identified one as Abed Shaheen, who promoted and carried out acts of terror, including shooting attacks on Israeli soldiers in Judea and Samaria. He was most recently working to recruit a terror squad to carry out additional attacks in the area of Shechem. The army said one soldier was seriously injured and three others moderately injured during the shootout and hospitalized. Soldiers searching the building found explosive charges, a gun, ammunition and weapons parts. In other counterterror raids, wanted Palestinians were arrested in the villages of Silwad, Dayr Ibzi, Kafr Ni’ma and Bani Naim. Since October 7, Israeli security forces have arrested more than 5,250 wanted Palestinians, of whom over 2,050 are associated with Hamas.

Iran launches massive missile barrage at Israel	The extent of the attack is not yet known. Hebrew-language media reports that Iran has fired more than 100 missiles. By JNS Iran has fired a barrage of missiles at Israel forcing the entire civilian population of the country to be ordered into bomb shelters, the Israel Defense Forces said Tuesday. 'A short while ago, missiles were launched from Iran towards the State of Israel,' the IDF stated. 'You are instructed to remain alert and precisely follow the Home Front Command’s instructions.' The IDF wrote on X/Twitter that 'all Israeli civilians' are sheltering from the attack. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the IDF spokesman, asked Israelis to remain vigilant. 'The air-defense system is fully operational, detecting and intercepting threats wherever necessary, even at this moment,' he said. 'However, the defense is not hermetic.' The extent of the attack is not yet known. Hebrew-language media reports that Iran has fired more than 100 missiles. Three Israeli officials told The New York Times that the feared assault could involve suicide drones and missiles fired towards the Jewish state. One U.S. official told the Times it would involve ballistic missiles, while another said that it was unclear what kind of attack would be launched. The targets of the Iranian attack are believed to be three Israeli Air Force bases, as well as an IDF military intelligence headquarters just north of Tel Aviv, which was reportedly evacuated on Tuesday afternoon. Israel informed Washington that an attack from Iran was imminent earlier on Tuesday. A direct Iranian attack on Israel will carry 'severe consequences' for the Islamic Republic, a senior White House official told JNS. 'A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran,' the White House official added. In April, Iran conducted its first-ever direct attack on Israeli territory, launching some 300 missiles and drones, the vast majority of which were shot down in a multinational effort. It said it attacked in retaliation for an April 1 strike that killed a top Iranian general in Damascus. In recent months, Iran and its allies have vowed to avenge the alleged Israeli killing of Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s 'political' bureau, and Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah, assassinated by Israel on Sept. 27. The United States Embassy in Jerusalem reportedly sent its employees home on Tuesday afternoon and told them to be prepared to enter bomb shelters, the first such order given since the April attack.

Mexico’s Sheinbaum takes office, making history as first Jewish w...	Sheinbaum’s inauguration caps an unlikely four-decade climb that has taken the daughter of activist academics to the presidential palace. By The Algemeiner and Reuters When Claudia Sheinbaum takes her oath of office on Tuesday, formally becoming Mexico’s first Jewish woman president, she will adopt a new government logo that nods to the aspirations of young girls. 'A young Mexican woman will be the emblem of Mexico’s government,' Sheinbaum wrote a day earlier in a post on social media, unveiling the logo showing a young woman in profile hoisting a Mexican flag, her hair pulled back into a ponytail not unlike the incoming president’s signature look. Sheinbaum has embraced her historic feat in one of Latin America’s more socially conservative countries, which until now has been ruled by a series of 65 men since winning its independence from Spain two centuries ago. The former mayor of the sprawling Mexican capital, Sheinbaum has been bolstered by the popularity of outgoing leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, her political benefactor going back nearly a quarter century. But as the former climate scientist steps out of her predecessor’s shadow to lead the world’s largest Spanish-speaking nation, Sheinbaum will also face doubts and opposition from critics alarmed by the outgoing president’s 11th-hour reform drive. Enacted last month, the reforms included a judicial overhaul that will over the next three years replace all of the country’s judges with new jurists elected by popular vote. 'Our hard-won democracy will be transformed, for all practical purposes, into a one-party autocracy,' wrote former President Ernesto Zedillo in a Sunday guest essay for Britain’s Economist Magazine. Critics of Lopez Obrador and Sheinbaum fear their ruling Morena party has too much power, and that democratic checks on executive power will be undermined. The judicial overhaul’s implementation will fall to Sheinbaum, who will also face a widening government budget deficit that could crimp popular welfare spending and costly crime-fighting initiatives at a time when the economy is only expected to grow modestly. The 62-year-old Sheinbaum promised continuity on the campaign trail, and now faces the balancing act of advancing Lopez Obrador’s state-centric economic polices, especially over natural resources such as oil and minerals, while also making progress on issues seen as his weak points like the environment and security. She also makes history as the first president of Jewish heritage in the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country. A BIGGER LANDSLIDE Sheinbaum’s inauguration caps an unlikely four-decade climb that has taken the daughter of activist academics to the presidential palace. Six years ago, she made history as Mexico City’s first elected woman mayor. Until she stepped down last year to run for president, Sheinbaum was known as a data-driven manager, winning plaudits for reducing the megacity’s homicide rate by half, by boosting security spending on an expanded police force with higher salaries. She has pledged to replicate the strategy across Mexico, where drug cartels exert widespread influence. Sheinbaum has also promised to continue generous social spending on old-age pensions and youth scholarships, even though the government’s 2024 fiscal deficit is estimated at nearly 6 percent of gross domestic product. While she has expressed interest growing renewable energy projects, she has also said she will ensure the dominance of Mexico’s state-owned oil and power companies while opposing any privatizations. In 1995, Sheinbaum earned her doctorate in energy engineering from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and then pursued an academic career, including a stint on the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which later shared a Nobel Peace Prize with former US Vice President Al Gore. She launched her political career in 2000, when Lopez Obrador, then-Mexico City’s newly elected mayor, tapped her to be his environmental chief, tasked with improving the smoggy capital’s air quality, highways and public transport. Sheinbaum served as the chief spokesperson for Lopez Obrador’s first campaign for president in 2006, which he narrowly lost. In 2015, she was elected to run Mexico City’s largest borough, Tlalpan, and became the capital’s mayor three years later. That was the same year that Lopez Obrador’s third bid for the presidency ended in his own triumph, winning by a margin of more than 17 million votes. Last June, Sheinbaum bested her mentor’s margin of victory, polling more than 19 million votes ahead of her closest competitor, who was also a woman.

Report: Biden administration leaked details of Israeli operation ...	Biden White House attempted to pressure Israel into limiting scope of Lebanon ground operation by leaking details of the incursion, senior Israeli official claims. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News The Biden administration leaked details of Israel's ground operation in southern Lebanon in a bid to pressure Jerusalem into limiting the scope and duration of the incursion, a senior Israeli official has claimed. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official told Israel's Kan News Tuesday morning that while the U.S. has given its blessing for a limited ground operation in southern Lebanon to root out Hezbollah forces and to secure Israel's northern border, the Biden administration is pressuring Israel to 'limit' the operation. According to the official, the White House leaked information regarding the operation itself, a 'dangerous' move which he said endangered Israeli troops. 'We didn't like that. It's clear to us that the U.S. is concerned — which is why they have 'tricks' to try and limit this matter,' the official said. The leak allegations may refer to comments by a senior American official who told media outlets Monday that Israel was preparing for an operation in Lebanon, emphasizing that the incursion would be 'limited.' Earlier on Tuesday, IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told foreign media outlets that the IDF is in the midst of a series of 'limited and targeted raids' along the Israel-Lebanon border, targeting Hezbollah positions. 'These localized ground raids will target Hezbollah strongholds that threaten Israeli towns, kibbutzim, and communities along our border.' Hagari added that the Israeli operation was planned in response to intelligence suggesting Hezbollah was preparing an invasion of northern Israel mirroring Hamas' invasion on October 7th. 'Hezbollah turned Lebanese villages near the Israeli border into military bases, all ready for an attack on Israel.' 'Hezbollah had prepared to use those villages as a staging ground for an October 7th-style invasion of Israeli homes.' The IDF last month said that it had killed members of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force allegedly responsible for the planned invasion of northern Israel.

Denouncing IDF ground operation in southern Lebanon as 'unlawful invasion,' Ankara demands United Nations Security Council intervene and 'take necessary measures' against Israeli 'occupation' of Lebanon. By World Israel News Staff The Turkish government called Tuesday for the United Nations Security Council to force Israel to halt its ground operation in southern Lebanon, denouncing the counter-terror action as an 'unlawful invasion.' On Monday, Israeli forces crossed the Blue Line into Lebanese territory, launching what the IDF on Tuesday called a 'limited' operation in southern Lebanon. The incursion is aimed at pushing back Hezbollah forces from the Israeli border and preventing future attacks on northern Israeli towns, which have been evacuated since last October. In response, the Turkish foreign ministry released a statement castigating the Israeli operation, dubbing it an 'illegal invasion attempt' and calling on the United Nations to intervene to force Israel to withdraw its forces. 'Israel's violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon by launching a ground attack is an illegal invasion attempt. This attack must come to an end immediately, and Israeli troops must withdraw from Lebanese territory,' the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Ankara warned that if continued, the Israeli ground operation in Lebanon would spark a destabilizing wave of mass migration which would empower 'extremists all around the world.' 'This attack targets the security and stability of the region and beyond. This dangerous invasion attempt is likely to spark a new wave of migration and to give ground to extremists all around the world. These developments will also affect the countries that provide political support and arms to Israel.' 'The UN Security Council must uphold international law and take the necessary measures against this attack that aims the occupation of Lebanon. Every crime committed by Israel is also a blow to international law and the UN Charter.' Turkey also reiterated its call for the United Nations to force a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and to prevent Israel from continuing its operations against Hamas. 'The main step that must be taken to restore peace in the region is to achieve immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. Bringing peace to Gaza is the responsibility of the entire humanity.'

Three injured as Hezbollah missiles pound central Israel in attac...	The Lebanese terror group launches missile barrage targeting Mossad headquarters in central Israel, hitting a freeway and injuring three people. By World Israel News Staff At least three people were injured Tuesday morning, after Hezbollah terrorists operating out of Lebanon launched a barrage of missiles and rockets at central Israel. At least five projectiles were launched towards Israel Tuesday morning, including a number of Fadi-4 missiles, one of the longer-ranged weapons in Hezbollah's arsenal. The terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it had targeted the headquarters of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency in Glilot, near Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv. Debris from an intercepted missile and the interceptor missile itself were reported in the central Israeli city of Kfar Saba, one missile launched Tuesday morning scored a direct hit on Highway 6, near Route 444, close to the city of Kfar Qassem. One man was struck by shrapnel from the missile impact, leaving him in moderate condition. The victim has been identified as a 54-year-old bus driver. He is said to have sustained shrapnel wounds to his head. A second driver was lightly injured as a result of being forced to abruptly stopping on the road to avoid the missile impact, while a police officer was lightly injured while assisting the first victim. Emergency first responders from Magen David Adom (MDA) and United Hatzalah were dispatched to the scene to treat the victims and to evacuate the bus driver to Beilinson Medical Center in Petah Tikva. Moshe Saadon, the head of United Hatzalah’s Elad branch, reported from the scene: 'We are providing initial medical aid to a man, approximately 50 years old, who sustained a head injury due to shrapnel.' 'At this stage, his condition is defined as moderate and stable. Fire department teams are operating at the scene due to the nature of the incident.' In addition to the missile attacks on central Israel, Hezbollah terrorists fired at least 30 rockets at northern Israel Tuesday, including at least 15 launched at the Western Galilee. The IDF responded to the attacks with airstrikes on Hezbollah weapon caches in Lebanon. Israeli ground forces entered southern Lebanon Monday night, the IDF announced Tuesday, as part of a 'limited' operation to clear Hezbollah threats from the Israeli frontier.

Greg Abbott plans to hold a state-wide moment of silence at 7 a.m. on Oct. 7 to mark the one-year anniversary of Hamas’s invasion of southern Israel. The governor, a pro-Israel Republican, also announced that state and U.S. flags will be at half-staff in Texas that day. 'I ask all Texans to join me in a moment of silence to remember the men, women and children who were brutally murdered or injured during acts of war committed by Hamas and for the seven Americans still held hostage,' Abbott stated. 'Texas will always stand with the State of Israel and the Israeli people as they continue to defend their freedoms in the face of pure evil,' he added. 'Cecilia and I continue to pray that this war will be brought to a swift, victorious conclusion for the Jewish community and the State of Israel.' Abbott added in a proclamation that he saw the 'carnage caused by Hamas' firsthand when he visited Israel in November. 'Meeting with displaced Israelis, including many families, and visiting with victims recovering in a hospital in Tel Aviv, it was sheer evil and savagery unmatched by anything I’ve ever seen,' he stated. 'What we have seen is gut-wrenching acts of war committed by Hamas.' 'The State of Israel is right and, moreover, righteous in pursuing the elimination of Hamas, and the State of Texas will do everything in our power to support the Jewish people here in Texas and in their defense of their homeland,' he added.' October 7, 2023 was a day of unimaginable horrors for Israel. In observance of the one-year anniversary, I ask my fellow Texans to join me in a moment of silence for the people of Israel and the seven Americans still held hostage. Texas will always stand with Israel. pic.twitter.com/mAHWl3aB7H &mdash; Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) September 30, 2024 The post Texas to mark Oct. 7 anniversary with moment of silence, lowered flags appeared first on World Israel News.	https://worldisraelnews.com/texas-to-mark-oct-7-anniversary-with-moment-of-silence-lowered-flags/	2024-10-01T03:41:12-07:00	https://worldisraelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/shutterstock_2188817463-scaled.jpg
Trump’s would-be killer pleads not guilty to attempted assassinat...	Routh hid outside a fence overlooking the sixth hole of the course, where authorities found an AK-47-style rifle. By Reuters and The Washington Free Beacon The man charged with attempting to assassinate Donald Trump after allegedly positioning himself with a rifle outside one of the former president's Florida golf courses on Sept. 15 pleaded not guilty on Monday to five federal charges. Ryan Routh, 58, entered the plea to charges that include attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate during a hearing in federal court. He has already been ordered to remain in jail to await a trial. Prosecutors have said Routh intended to kill Trump as he golfed at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. Routh condemned the Republican presidential candidate in a self-published book and dropped off a letter left months earlier with an associate referencing an attempted assassination on Trump, according to prosecutors. 'This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you,' the suspect wrote, according to a court filing by prosecutors. Lawyers for Routh suggested at a Sept. 23 court hearing that the letter may have been an attempt by their client at gaining publicity and highlighted what they called Routh's efforts to promote democracy in Ukraine and Taiwan. Routh hid outside a fence overlooking the sixth hole of the course, where authorities found an AK-47-style rifle, a bag of snacks, a digital camera, and bags containing metal plates meant to withstand return fire by the U.S. Secret Service, according to prosecutors. A Secret Service agent patrolling the course ahead of Trump spotted Routh and opened fire after noticing the rifle sticking through a fence. Routh fled and was later arrested along a Florida highway, prosecutors said. Routh was initially charged with gun-related offenses. An indictment last week added the attempted assassination charge along with assault on a federal officer and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence. The Florida incident was the second apparent assassination attempt on Trump in a roughly two-month span, raising questions about protection of the candidate ahead of the Nov. 5 election. A gunman wounded Trump's right ear and killed an attendee at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 before being killed by a Secret Service sniper.

Biden Defense Secretary speaks with Israeli defense chief as IDF ...	Israeli defense minister discusses scope of new ground war in Lebanon, as well as Israel's goals after IDF ground forces enter southern Lebanon. By World Israel News Staff Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant (Likud) spoke by phone with U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin overnight, the Israeli Defense Ministry announced Tuesday morning. The two spoke shortly after Israeli ground forces entered Lebanon, launching the IDF's much-anticipated ground campaign against Hezbollah. During their conversation, Gallant discussed the scope of the new ground operation and its goals, emphasizing the centrality of ensuring the safe return of Israel’s citizens to their homes in the north. Gallant also briefed the Defense Secretary on the operational and strategic measures required to achieve this objective. The Israeli Defense Minister and Austin agreed on the importance of dismantling the terrorist infrastructure along Israel's northern border to prevent attacks by Hezbollah against Israeli citizens. To this end, Gallant discussed the localized and targeted raids that the IDF launched overnight, against Hezbollah terror targets in the border area of southern Lebanon. These ground operations, he said, build on the recent and ongoing measures taken to eliminate senior Hezbollah leadership and to degrade Hezbollah’s offensive capabilities, including Friday's killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, and the pager and radio bombings earlier this month which killed dozens of Hezbollah operatives and injured thousands more. Minister Gallant and Secretary Austin also discussed ongoing threats posed by Iran and its proxies in the region, including Iranian proxies and militias in Iraq, Yemen and Syria. They discussed the importance of U.S. force posture and the interoperability of U.S. and Israeli defensive capabilities. Austin and Gallant also discussed ongoing military efforts in the southern arena. The Israeli defense chief reiterated his determination to achieve a framework that will enable the return of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, and highlighted the critical timing and current window of opportunity to advance this issue.

New evidence Hamas burned children to death on October 7th	Video and forensic evidence gathered over months shows the Islamists burned and shot 27 minors to death, including infants. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News After eleven months of painstaking investigation, the Israel Police reported Thursday that it had proof of Hamas terrorists’ massacre of fully 27 children during their October 7 invasion of Israel. 'We collected 11,666 videos that provide a comprehensive evidentiary basis gathered from various sources from just one kibbutz, which will enable us to file some of the most severe indictments against the perpetrators of these brutal terror acts,' said Superintendent Reut Anoim, head of Lahav 433’ cyber investigation division that led the meticulous effort. Video evidence was collected from victims’ phones, home surveillance and street cameras in the entire Gaza envelope, as well as the GoPro cameras that the terrorists themselves wore to record their atrocities and the clips they posted to social media glorifying their war crimes. Eyewitness testimony by survivors, evidence gathered by those finding the dead in the aftermath, such as volunteers of the ZAKA Search and Rescue units, together with the thorough work of forensic specialists examining the remains, were also used to prove conclusively that despite Hamas denials, its men murdered minors from infanthood to age 17 in horrific ways. 'That children were burned, shot and murdered alongside their parents is a proven fact,' said Dudi Katz, the head of the 433 cyber unit. 'Children witnessed their parents being murdered and we found a scene with a pile of bodies from the same family more than once.' In one case, Katz said, there was evidence that a young child of six or seven had been burned alive. 'His glazed expression indicated that he had been burned alive.' The police were determined to build an airtight legal case against the perpetrators, ultimately going through over 200,000 video clips, some of which were found to be bogus. 'We worked hard to maintain the highest standards of verification and cross-referencing, compared to the fake materials circulating on social media,' Anoim said. The question now is when will justice be served. The IDF has captured thousands of Hamas terrorists since taking the war into Gaza, an unknown number of whom took part in the surprise attack in which 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals were massacred overall and 251 taken hostage. The army’s Unit 504, Shabak and police investigators have all participated in interrogating prisoners, with authorities even publicizing clips of some terrorists confessing the crimes they committed in Gaza envelope communities on the day Israel calls 'the black Sabbath.' Yet to date, no indictments have been filed against any terrorist. Israel has yet to decide whether to try them in a standard court, as if the Islamic extremists were regular, though heinous, criminals, in a military court as they acted as an organized, if illegal, fighting force, or in a special court, as terrorists are not legally defined as military personnel. According to a Walla report last month, some people in the state prosecutor’s office want to delay bringing charges because of the possibility that captured terrorists may still shed light on additional murders their compatriots in prison have committed. The police reacted to the report by saying that the arrest of Hamas fighters in Gaza is ongoing and will probably last a long time, and it is time to start using the mountains of evidence they have collected against specific terrorists.

‘Mafia tactics’: How Hezbollah intimidates Christians, steals sou...	We’re talking about extortion, forcing Christians to pay protection money, burning houses and cars and kidnapping businessmen,' said Elias Zarina, co-founder and community manager of the Jerusalemite Initiative. By Pesach Benson, TPS The phone rests on the car’s dashboard filming nothing out of the ordinary as it passes the green pasture of the southern Lebanese village of Aanquon. The driver carefully lifts the phone, as if to take a selfie, but there’s no cheerful smile on his face. In the background over his shoulder — on the other side of the street in front of a small house — is a rocket launcher attached to a truck. It passes out of view as the car drives past. But it is unmistakable. The video, shared with The Press Service of Israel, is a symbol of the 'mafia tactics' Hezbollah has adopted in southern Lebanon, embedding its forces in Christian communities, stealing property and extorting business owners. 'For almost 20 years, Hezbollah groups have been systematically oppressing Christians in southern Lebanon, seizing homes and factories for use by Hezbollah members,' one southern Lebanese Christian told TPS-IL after evacuating to Beirut. He works in health care in the town of Marjayoun, but otherwise insists on anonymity. 'I will be killed along with my family members on charges of collaborating with Israel, without trial or justice, [but with] executions in public squares.' Elias Zarina, co-founder and community manager of the Jerusalemite Initiative, a Jerusalem-based non-profit that encourages Arab-speaking integration into Israeli society has been hearing similar stories from his contacts in Lebanon. Zarina is also a researcher and specialist in the Middle East’s Christian and other minority communities. 'Hezbollah uses mafia tactics in south Lebanon,' he tells TPS-IL. 'We’re talking about extortion, forcing Christians to pay protection money, burning houses and cars and kidnapping businessmen. Those are the tactics they use. The Lebanese government doesn’t do anything. It’s dominated by Hezbollah.' Lebanon’s 2.24 million Christians make up one-third of the country’s population. 'The Lebanese avoid sharing these stories because they’re afraid. If there’s an attack from Israel, if Hezbollah sees you filming, they take your phone or camera and break it. Not just Christians, but Muslims too. They’ll be in trouble. Everyone’s afraid,' Zarina said. ‘They Show Up in the Village’ Explaining the video, Zarina told TPS-IL, 'Hezbollah stores the trucks and launchers at a facility in, say Nabatieh. When they’re ready to fire, they show up in the village and choose a time to launch it.' The home beside the launcher is Christian, he added. 'Radical Islamic terrorists all have the same strategy,' Zarina explained. They always want to pressure Christians to force the Western countries to go against Israel. They want to put Christians between them and Israel to portray Israelis as Nazis.' Aanquon is a microcosm of what Hezbollah is trying to achieve. 'In 2000, before Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon, Aanquoun was about two-thirds Christian,' said Zarina. 'Today, Christians are about 18%. From 2000 to today, the Christian population shrunk. Hezbollah has been trying to take over the houses, forcing them to leave. Hezbollah’s goal is to take control of all of south Lebanon and store missiles inside private homes. The more property they control, the safer it is for Hezbollah figures to operate.' Said the anonymous health care worker to TPS-IL, 'The Christian world must understand that Christians in Lebanon in general – and in the south in particular – have become an ethnic minority after they were masters of this country. Iran occupied Lebanon through its arm,' referring to Hezbollah. The evacuation from southern Lebanon has exacerbated those tensions. A well-respected southern Lebanese Christian who tweets anonymously under the name Sobalaan, wrote on Friday, 'They monitor empty apartments and expatriate homes, and there may be subsequent attempts to break into them.' Zarina adds that his contacts have shared reports of empty Christian homes being looted by Hezbollah. When Israeli forces abruptly withdrew from southern Lebanon in May 2000, members of the Southern Lebanese Army, a Christian militia that worked with Israel fled, mostly to Israel or North America. But the Christians who were not associated with the SLA stayed because 'They thought they were safe,' Zarina said. 'But they’re the ones being pressured to sell their property to Hezbollah.' Asked if he has any message for the Israelis, the resident told TPS-IL, 'We trusted them [Israelis] and fought together against the terrorists, and in the end, they betrayed the covenant and gave southern Lebanon to the Shi’ites,' without elaborating. After the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, the Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing rockets and launching drones at northern Israel communities, killing 49 people. According to figures released by the government on Sept. 29, more than 68,000 residents of northern Israel are displaced from their homes. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they would continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. Israel’s war goals include securely returning northern residents to their homes. Israeli officials demand that Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from southern Lebanon in compliance with UN Security Council resolution 1701 which ended the Second Lebanon War of 2006. This includes all areas south of the Litani River such as the cities of Nabatieh and Tyre, as well as the Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.

‘The worst Democratic performance in a generation’: CNN sounds al...	Earlier this month, Harris became the first Democratic presidential nominee not to receive the Teamsters endorsement in nearly 30 years. By Blake Mauro, The Washington Free Beacon CNN data reporter Harry Enten admitted that Vice President Kamala Harris has the 'worst' support among union households for a Democratic presidential candidate 'in a generation,' while Donald Trump is 'doing very, very well' with the historically Democratic voting block. 'You know, you go back to 1992, Bill Clinton won that union vote by 30 points, and Hillary Clinton only won it by 12 points back in 2016,' Enten told CNN host Sara Sidner on Monday. 'But look at where Kamala Harris is today. She’s only leading by 9 points. That would be the worst Democratic performance in a generation, 10 points off the mark of Joe Biden.' The polling comes just one day before the International Longshoremen’s Association union is set to strike across all Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports from Maine to Texas. Port and business leaders blamed the Biden-Harris administration’s lack of leadership for the strike, which is expected to have detrimental effects on America’s supply chain and cost the economy about $5 billion a day, according to a JP Morgan analysis. Former president Trump is 'doing very, very well' among working-class voters as well as with other demographics that have previously voted for Democratic presidents, Enten said. 'And this is part of a larger trend that we’re seeing throughout our politics in which Republicans, specifically Donald Trump, is doing very, very well among working-class voters, whether they were in unions, whether they went to trade school, or whether they’re voters of color,' Enten added. Trump has more working class support than any GOP presidential candidate in a generation. He's on track for the best performance among union voters in 40 years. He's up 31 points among trade school grads. He's doing 17 pts better among nonwhite non-college voters than in 2020. pic.twitter.com/0ObrWWNzYf &mdash; (((Harry Enten))) (@ForecasterEnten) September 30, 2024 Earlier this month, Harris became the first Democratic presidential nominee not to receive the Teamsters endorsement in nearly 30 years. The union declined to back a candidate after a strong majority—59.6 to 34 percent—of its rank-and-file members voted to endorse Trump. The Teamsters, one of the country's largest unions, has historically supported Democratic candidates for president. Trump holds a 31-point advantage over Harris among vocational and trade school graduates. In 1992 pre-election polling, Bill Clinton led that vote over George H.W. Bush by 7 points. 'That has moved from being a core Democratic group to now being a core group of Donald Trump’s massive amount of support among the working class,' the CNN reporter noted. Harris has also been polling worse among 'non-college voters of color' than Democrats have in previous elections, while Trump has gained support within that demographic, according to CNN. 'Joe Biden won that group by 45 points. Look at where Kamala Harris’s support is today. She’s still leading amongst that group, but that lead is down &#8230; to just 28 points,' Enten said. 'The fact is Donald Trump seems to have gone into a hotbed of traditional Democratic support and made a lot of movement in ways I don’t think a lot of people would have thought when he went down that escalator just back in 2015.'

IDF to Lebanese: ‘Don’t go south of the Litani’	Hezbollah is using civilians as human shields to carry out attacks against Israel,' warns IDF spokesman. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli military warned Lebanese citizens not to travel south of the Litani River in an Arabic-language message on Tuesday morning, hours after Israeli soldiers began a late-night invasion of the region. 'There is intense fighting in southern Lebanon, in which Hezbollah operatives are using the civilian environment and you as a human shield to organize to carry out attacks,' Col. Avichay Adraee, the IDF’s Arabic-language spokesman, said in a recorded video statement published on social media platform X. 'For the benefit of your personal safety, we ask you to avoid traveling in vehicles&#8230;south of the Litani River. This warning is in effect until further notice.' The vast majority of civilians had already evacuated from their villages in southern Lebanon prior to the escalation between Israel and Hezbollah, which began about two weeks ago. Days before the beeper explosions served as an opening salvo to an intensive bombing and assassination campaign, it was believed that just 20 percent of southern Lebanon's residents had remained in their homes. The invasion comes after Israel assassinated Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, along with the entirety of the terror organization's senior leadership. Some one million Lebanese have been displaced by the ongoing fighting between Hezbollah and Israel, with tens of thousands said to have crossed the border into neighboring Syria. 'Lebanon is facing one of the most dangerous stages in its history,' Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati told representatives from UN aid organizations and international ambassadors on Tuesday. The decision to invade Lebanon is 'important, correct and necessary,' Public Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said in a statement on Tuesday. 'At the same time, this is the time not to stop, [we must] continue doing everything to crush Hezbollah, with all our might,' he continued. 'I pray for the success of the IDF soldiers who are currently fighting in difficult conditions in southern Lebanon; the people of Israel stand behind them.'

22 dead in Israeli airstrikes in Syria as IDF enters southern Leb...	Israeli warplanes bomb Iranian base in eastern Syria and regime positions in Damascus, killing at least 22, as IDF ground forces enter southern Lebanon. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Israeli airstrikes killed at least 22 people in two separate attacks in Syria overnight, according to a state media outlet and an opposition observer organization. According to a report by SANA, the Syrian state-controlled broadcaster, Israeli warplanes and unmanned aircraft struck Damascus at 2:05 a.m. Tuesday, approaching the Syrian capital from the direction of the Golan Heights. Three people were killed in the attack, SANA claimed, including television news anchor Safaa Ahmed. Nine others were injured in the strikes, SANA reported. In a separate attack overnight, Israeli fighter jets hit an Iranian base in eastern Syria, and a number of weapons caches and warehouses. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a group opposed to the Assad regime, reported that 19 members of pro-Iranian militias were killed in the strikes, with 18 more injured in the attacks. The dead included seven Syrian nationals, nine Iraqis, and three'non-Syrians' whose nationality was not reported. The strikes reportedly targeted Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps positions in Deir Ezzor, 56 miles (90 kilometers) from the Iraqi border, and outside of Al Bukamal. The targets included an Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps guesthouse in the village of Al-Heri, two weapons caches in Al-Hizzam, a warehouse in Al-Suwaiyah, the IRGC regional headquarters in Deir Ezzor, and a radar facility. The airstrikes came just hours after IDF ground forces entered southern Lebanon. On Tuesday, the IDF confirmed that a limit ground operation in Lebanon had begun. 'The IDF is operating according to a methodical plan set out by the General Staff and the Northern Command which IDF soldiers have trained and prepared for in recent months,' the Israeli military said. 'The Israeli Air Force and IDF Artillery are supporting the ground forces with precise strikes on military targets in the area.'

Biden admin offers cautious support for Lebanon invasion	Washington reiterates it supports Israel's right to defend itself, but urge ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff Several prominent Biden administration officials offered cautious support for the Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon which began late Monday evening, though many continued calling for a ceasefire between Israel and the Hezbollah terror group. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin wrote on social media platform X that he had spoken to his Israeli counterpart, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and expressed his support for an Israeli incursion limited to areas directly adjacent to the border. 'I made it clear that the United States supports Israel’s right to defend itself. We agreed on the necessity of dismantling attack infrastructure along the border to ensure that Lebanese Hezbollah cannot conduct October 7-style attacks on Israel’s northern communities,' Austin said. But, he continued, 'a diplomatic resolution is required to ensure that civilians can return safely to their homes on both sides of the border.' Austin did not reference nearly a year of failed talks aimed at achieving such a diplomatic solution. 'I reiterated the serious consequences for Iran in the event Iran chooses to launch a direct military attack against Israel,' he added. 'Israel has a right to defend itself against Hezbollah. If you look at how this conflict across Israel’s northern border started, it was Hezbollah that started launching attacks on Israel on October 8th. And those attacks continued and have continued and are continuing,' U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Tuesday morning. 'If you look at what the acting leader of Hezbollah said just today, it’s that their attacks on Israel will continue. So Israel has a right to defend itself against those attacks. That includes in targeting terrorist infrastructure inside Lebanon.' Miller concluded by stressing that Washington 'ultimately want to see a diplomatic resolution to conflict in the Middle East that provides long-term security for the people of Israel, the people of Lebanon, and the Palestinian people.' When asked by a reporter if he was aware that Israel had begun its ground invasion of Lebanon, Biden responded that 'I'm more aware than you might know, and I'm comfortable with them stopping. We should have a cease-fire now.'

By World Israel News Staff An Iranian elite intelligence unit aimed at thwarting Mossad activity was thoroughly infiltrated by the Mossad, said former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in a bombshell interview with CNN Turkey on Monday. 'Israel can even threaten the safety of the [Supreme Leader Ali] Khamenei with its intelligence network operating in Iran through the Mossad. Let me give an example from eight years ago to understand the kind of power Israel has achieved within Iran through the Mossad,' Ahmadinejad said. 'Israel organizes complex operations inside Iran,' he continued. 'They can easily obtain very important information. Iranian authorities are still silent about this situation. Mossad had such a large network of agents in Iran, both on the streets and within the government, that they could have assassinated anyone they wanted to.' Ahmadinejad added that the Iranian in charge of the country's anti-Mossad unit 'was an Israeli agent.' The former president also said that this individual, along with 20 others in the unit, were responsible for the theft of classified documents regarding Iran's nuclear program, which were presented to the United Nations by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2018. Those double agents also were responsible for the assassination of several Iranian nuclear scientists, then fled the country. 'The Mossad has infiltrated various state units in Iran over the past ten years. All government officials now need to fear for their lives,' former Iranian foreign minister Ali Younesi said in a 2022 interview. 'Things have gotten to a point where they have started openly threatening government officials. As someone who worked in the intelligence ministry, the situation pains me.' According to recent reports, the Mossad has foiled some 50 terror attacks since the October 7th massacres. A recent failed suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is thought to have been planned by Iran.

Israeli tanks cross into Lebanon for the first time since 2006 – ...	Areas in northern Israel, including Metula, Misgav Am, and Kfar Gilad, were declared a closed military zone, and entry was prohibited. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News As of 10:30 on Monday night, Al-Arabiya reports that Israeli tanks crossed the border into southern Lebanon. The Lebanese army withdrew from areas in southern Lebanon, and IDF began to open fire. Areas in northern Israel, including Metula, Misgav Am, and Kfar Gilad, were declared a closed military zone, and entry was prohibited. Earlier on Monday, Israel intercepted missiles coming from Lebanon targeting Central Galilee and Haifa Bay. This occurred after the IAF destroyed a storage area for missile launchers close to the Beirut airport. In addition, Israel destroyed dozens of terror targets in Lebanon, including command centers, weapons storage facilities, terrorist cells, launchers, and additional terror infrastructure sites. The Wall Street Journal reported early on Monday that Elite units have been making short intelligence raids for weeks and even months in anticipation of acting on the necessity of permanently removing the Hezbollah terrorist organization from the border via a ground invasion. Their probes have included terror tunnels built by Hezbollah right up to Israel’s northern border, dug to enable its specialized Radwan force to invade the Galilee much as Hamas did on October 7, which sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. The fear of such a future invasion has led some 60,000 residents of the north to say that they will refuse to return home until the threat is nullified. A senior US official told Fox News on Monday that Israel is preparing to launch a 'limited' ground war in Lebanon. The war with Lebanon is expected to be smaller and shorter in duration than in 2006. Despite US President Joe Biden’s insistence on Sunday that the US would not send more troops into Lebanon, the Pentagon said it would deploy a few thousand soldiers to supplement the US forces already in the region. The purpose of the deployment is to protect US troops already there and, if necessary, to defend Israel.

Israeli tanks cross border into Lebanon – report	Israel destroyed dozens of terror targets in Lebanon, including command centers, weapons storage facilities, terrorist cells, launchers, and additional terror infrastructure sites. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News As of 10:30 on Monday night, Al-Arabiya reports that Israeli tanks crossed the border into southern Lebanon. The Lebanese army withdrew from areas in southern Lebanon, and IDF began to open fire. Areas in northern Israel, including Metula, Misgav Am, and Kfar Gilad, were declared a closed military zone, and entry was prohibited. Earlier on Monday, Israel intercepted missiles coming from Lebanon targeting Central Galilee and Haifa Bay. This occurred after the IAF destroyed a storage area for missile launchers close to the Beirut airport. In addition, Israel destroyed dozens of terror targets in Lebanon, including command centers, weapons storage facilities, terrorist cells, launchers, and additional terror infrastructure sites.

Israeli security forces warn Iran is recruiting Israelis for assa...	Iranians using false identities on the internet are contacting Israelis and paying them to carry out random, even seemingly innocent tasks. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Shin Bet, Israel's security agency, is warning the public to be vigilant that Iranians are recruiting Israelis to carry out assassination plots. The security agency has had to take measures to quell such attempts, several of which were in advanced stages. Iranians using false identities on the internet are contacting Israelis and paying them to carry out random, even seemingly innocent tasks. They are attempting to contact Israelis through digital currency sites, job platforms, and Israeli finance sites. The agents persuade their contacts to do simple tasks, such as burying devices and money or distributing flyers for large amounts of money. The requests often escalate to writing graffiti, setting vehicles on fire, and, in some cases, physically harming people. Shin Bet has asked the Israeli public to be on guard against being contacted by strangers who ask them to carry out errands and simple tasks for large amounts of money. Earlier in the month, The Shin Bet foiled an Iranian plot to assassinate high-profile figures in Israel, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. After Hamas politburo head Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran – an act which was widely attributed to Israel, but for which Jerusalem has not officially claimed responsibility – Iran sought to kill an Israeli leader in retaliation. Iranian intelligence also considered killing Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar, and former prime minister Naftali Bennett, the Shin Bet said. Iran recruited a Jewish-Israeli businessman living in Turkey as part of their plot, smuggling him twice into Iran to discuss carrying out missions for the Islamic regime in exchange for payment. The Israeli businessman, 73, had lived in Turkey for long periods of time. Tehran was said to have made contact with the man via Turkish businesspeople. The Israeli, who has not been publicly named, was arrested last month. A gag order on reporting about the pending criminal case against him was recently lifted. During his visits to Iran, which occurred in April and August 2024, the Israeli met with high-level Iranian intelligence officials. He was asked to engage in surveillance activities, such as photographing public places in Israel. The Israeli knew that the discussions' goal was to 'advance assassination attacks' on Israeli officials, the Shin Bet said.

By World Israel News Staff A senior US official told Fox News on Monday that Israel is preparing to launch a 'limited' ground war in Lebanon. The war with Lebanon is expected to be smaller and shorter in duration than the one in 2006. Despite US President Joe Biden's insistence on Sunday that the US would not send more troops into Lebanon, the Pentagon said it would deploy a few thousand soldiers to supplement the US forces already in the region. The purpose of the deployment is to protect US troops already there and, if necessary, to defend Israel. Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters that the US will also increase the number of fighter jets in the area, including squadrons of F-15 Strike Eagles, F-16, A-10, and F-22 fighter jets. On Monday, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant spoke to IDF soldiers about deployment to Lebanon and said, 'To ensure the return of Israel's northern communities, we will employ all of our capabilities, and this includes you &#8230; We trust you to accomplish every mission at hand,' Gallant added.

Houthis are causing a shofar shortage ahead of Rosh Hashana celeb...	The Houthis, an Iran-backed Yemenite terror group, are interfering with deliveries. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News As Rosh Hashana approaches, the nearly year-long war is causing a shortage of shofars, the traditional ram's horn instrument that makes a plaintive cry during the Jewish New Year prayer service. Many of these instruments arrive in Israel through the port of Eilat, and the Houthis, a Yemenite Iran-backed terror group, are interfering with deliveries. Shippers have re-routed shofar deliveries, causing delays and fewer shofars delivered to Israel. Jan-Elazar Refoua, who sells Judaica and gifts in downtown Jerusalem and specializes in shofars, reported that he usually sells six shofars a day in the period leading up to Rosh Hashana, but this year, he often sells just one daily. Refoua spoke with Jerusalem Post about the difficulties leading up to Rosh Hashana, 'I went to order merchandise, and they would say, 'OK, it will be another week, or another two weeks,'' he explained. The prices were 15% to 20% higher when the shofars were finally available. The shortage has not created the problem of scarcity since tourism has also declined dramatically during the war, and therefore, fewer people are buying them. However, despite the hardship created by the war, Refoua still hopes his business will survive and even thrive after the war. 'I have been here in this store for 42 years. We got through all the terror attacks and coronavirus,' he added that his wife was injured in a terror attack. Refoua, who has three sons in reserves in Gaza, said, 'The main thing is that there should be more quiet and peace and that the soldiers will return in peace; that is what really matters.' 'We are like a sword – it gets stronger from being in the flame – heated and cooled,' he added. 'Shofar is godly music,' he said. 'Sometimes you don't hear it with your ears; you hear it with your heart. It's a different feeling.'

Do most Israelis think now is the time to attack Iran’s nuclear f...	The Israeli public was asked whether Israel should now seize the momentum it has gained through its recent strikes on Hezbollah to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. By Caroline B. Glick, JNS Israelis are almost unanimous in their support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision not to coordinate the airstrike that targeted Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah with the Biden administration in advance of its commission, a new JNS poll conducted by Direct Polls show. 'According to reports, Israel did not coordinate with the United States in advance of it carrying out its operation to assassinate Hassan Nasrallah. Do you think it was the right decision or the wrong decision? Eighty-three percent of respondents responded that it was the right decision. Nine percent felt it was the wrong decision. Eight percent did not know. For the past several decades, Hezbollah ground forces and missile arsenal in Lebanon have deterred Israel from attacking Iran. Fearing that Iran would order Hezbollah to attack Israel with daily barrages of thousands of missiles and order its ground forces to invade the Galilee, Israel delayed acting directly against Iran’s nuclear and missile installations. The public was asked whether Israel should now seize the momentum it has gained through its recent strikes on Hezbollah to attack Iran's nuclear facilities before the U.S. elections. Sixty-two percent of the public answered affirmatively. Twenty-six percent said that Israel should abstain from using its momentum to attack Iran’s nuclear facilities ahead of the U.S. elections. Twelve percent said they did not know. Finally, JNS asked which candidate for U.S. president Israelis believe will be more sympathetic to Israel’s interests. Sixty-five percent of respondents said Republican candidate Donald Trump would be more sympathetic to Israel’s interests. Just 13% of Israelis believe that Democratic candidate Kamala Harris would be more supportive of Israel. Fifteen percent of respondents said that both would be equally sympathetic to Israeli interests and 7% said neither would be sympathetic to Israel’s interests. The results of the JNS poll align with results of one commissioned by Channel 14 and conducted last week by Direct Polls. That survey, carried out the day before Israel’s elimination of Nasrallah, asked the public whether they believed that the U.S. has weakened or strengthened Israel in its struggle to remove military threats to its national security from the south and the north of the country. Fifty-seven percent of respondents said the U.S. has weakened Israel. Thirty-five percent responded that the U.S. has strengthened Israel. Eight percent didn’t know. The thrust of both polls indicate that Israelis believe that the Biden administration does not share or support Israel’s war goals and are concerned that the administration will use the lame-duck period between the Nov. 5 presidential election and the inauguration of the next president on Jan. 20, 2025, to undermine Israel’s capacity to win the war. Direct Polls questioned a sample of 520 adults (aged 18 and older) representing Israel’s general population.

State of Israeli tourism after a year of war	Most of the visitors to Israel over the past year have been Jewish (62%) with 29% being Christian (Catholic and evangelical). By JNS On the eve of Jewish year 5785, the Israeli Tourism Ministry has published an overview of the state of the country’s tourism industry after a year of war, and its efforts to handle Israel’s tens of thousands of internal evacuees, many of whom have been placed in hotels. Israel suffered a loss of about 18.7 billion shekels ($5 billion) from incoming tourism and 756 million shekels ($203 million) from domestic tourism, according to the ministry. Since the outbreak of war, around 853,000 tourist entries have been registered, mainly from (in descending order): the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Russia and the Philippines. The Swords of Iron War disrupted the tourism industry’s recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. Based on the pace of tourist arrivals until the war, a new incoming tourism record appeared in the offing, surpassing 2019’s 4.5 million entries. But in 2023, only 3 million tourist entries were recorded. And in 2024 only 1 million arrivals are expected. Most of the visitors to Israel over the past year have been Jewish (62%) with 29% being Christian (Catholic and evangelical). About 44% came to visit friends and family, 28% gave classic tourism as the reason for their visit and 13% came for business. Seventy-three percent of tourists had previously visited Israel. Of the evacuees, 68,712 have not yet returned home, most of them from northern communities. Of those, 53,113 are staying within the community, while 15,599 are being hosted in hotels. Shortly after the war’s start, Tourism Minister Haim Katz requested and received authority to manage the evacuation of residents living along the conflict line. The ministry’s involvement in managing the evacuation has saved the state about 5.2 billion shekels ($1.4 billion) by eliminating agent commissions for hotel placements and due to the difference between hotel rates and grants for evacuees choosing other accommodation options. 'Our individualized and sensitive treatment of evacuees helped strengthen the home front’s resilience during Israel’s prolonged campaign,' said Katz. To date, the evacuation has cost 8.6 billion shekels ($2.3 billion), including 5.5 billion shekels ($1.5 billion) paid to hotels. The ministry booked approximately four million rooms and 13.5 million overnight stays. An additional 3.2 billion shekels (860 million) was paid in accommodation grants. 'We worked to preserve the infrastructure needed for the tourism industry for the day after and we continue our efforts to encourage tourism even during these challenging times,' said Katz. Despite the tourism crisis, the ministry continues to receive many grant requests for hotel construction and expansion. In 2023, grants were approved for the construction of 2,122 hotel rooms. Since the start of the war, seven hotels have opened with the assistance of the ministry, adding 765 rooms.

‘We refuse to be silent’ – First European memorial for October 7t...	Sweden hosts the first-ever memorial in Europe to the victims of the October 7th massacres. By World Israel News Staff The first European memorial event for the victims of October 7th was recently held in Sweden, marking a moment of solidarity against rising anti-Semitism and violence. Hundreds gathered at the Kristet Center in Örebro, Sweden, in a powerful display of support for the State of Israel and the Jewish people. The event featured a heartfelt address from the President of Israel, Isaac Herzog, who sent his message from Jerusalem. 'Today, we mark one year since the terrible force of hatred was unleashed against our people in our own land,' President Herzog said. 'One year since our women and our children, our people, were hunted down in their beds, burned to death, beheaded, raped, and shot. One year since hundreds of our people were dragged into captivity, dead or alive.' Herzog’s words brought a somber reality to the forefront – that these acts of terror were not just against Israel, but against humanity itself. Quoting the Book of Lamentations, he said, 'O wall of the daughter of Zion, let terror run down like a river, day and night. Give thyself no rest.' He emphasized that these were not only Israel's tears but also the tears of all who stand against hatred and injustice. In the face of continued anti-Semitism and hostility towards Israel, President Herzog praised the unwavering support of the Christian community in Sweden, declaring: 'When the arrows of hatred and anti-Semitism are still turned on Israel and the Jewish people, you do not rest either. When hostages are still being held in the dungeons of Gaza, you, friends, are not silent, not in your hearts and not in your deeds.' Pastor Per-Åke Eliasson, the Senior Pastor of Kristet Center Örebro, expressed his congregation’s deep commitment to standing with Israel. 'We refuse to be silent in the face of such evil,' he declared. 'Our support for Israel is rooted in love, in faith, and in the belief that we must stand up against hatred wherever it exists. This is not just Israel's fight – it is a fight for humanity, for decency, and for the right to live in peace.' 'We stand with Israel not just in times of celebration, but especially in times of suffering. Our voices will rise against injustice, and our prayers will strengthen those who fight for freedom and peace.' As the event drew to a close, President Herzog’s final words echoed through the hall: 'Let us continue to hold the faith in our hearts that love will overcome hatred, that our hostages will come back home soon and make us whole again, and that we will live to see prosperity and peace in our region.'

Netanyahu to Iranian people: ‘You deserve better’	Tehran's 'puppets are eliminated,' Netanyahu says in statement to Iranian people, calling for overthrow of 'Iran's tyrants.' By World Israel News Staff Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a video statement Monday directed at the people of Iran, urging them to defy their government, warning that it is pushing Iran 'closer to the abyss,' adding that Tehran’s proxy war against Israel was a losing battle. 'I speak a lot about the leaders of Iran,' Netanyahu said. 'Yet at this pivotal moment, I want to address you – the people of Iran. I want to do so directly, without filters, without middlemen.' 'Every day, you see a regime that subjugates you, makes fiery speeches about defending Lebanon, defending Gaza. Yet every day, that regime plunges our region deeper into darkness and deeper into war.' Referencing the targeted killings of Hamas’ military commander in the Gaza Strip, Mohammed Deif, and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Netanyahu boasted that the IDF was rapidly destroying the leadership of two of Iran’s largest proxy forces. 'Every day, their puppets are eliminated. Ask Mohammed Deif. Ask Nasrallah. There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach. There is nowhere we will not go to protect our people and protect our country.' 'With every passing moment, the regime is bringing you — the noble Persian people — closer to the abyss.' 'The vast majority of Iranians know their regime doesn't care a whit about them. If it did care, if it cared about you, it would stop wasting billions of dollars on futile wars across the Middle East. It would start improving your lives.' Offering a vision of globalized trade and investment, Netanyahu said that a post-Islamist Iran would 'finally be at peace' – including with Israel. 'When Iran is finally free and that moment will come a lot sooner than people think – everything will be different. Our two ancient peoples, the Jewish people and the Persian people, will finally be at peace. Our two countries, Israel and Iran, will be at peace.' 'Don't let a small group of fanatic theocrats crush your hopes and your dreams,' Netanyahu continued. 'I know you don’t support the rapists and murderers of Hamas and Hezbollah, but your leaders do. You deserve more. The people of Iran should know – Israel stands with you.'

How a handshake led to Hezbollah chief’s assassination	The IDF has managed to infiltrate Hezbollah by all intelligence means, which has led to the almost complete decapitation of the terrorist group. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News Israel succeeded in assassinating Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah Friday because someone shook his hand in greeting, Saudi Arabian station Al Hadath reported Sunday. Quoting anonymous sources, the station said, 'A person met with Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, shook his hand, and then smeared his hand with a substance that allowed Israel to track him.' The only identifier posited for that person was that he was from Iran. Whether true or not, it points to the undeniable fact that Israel’s intelligence that led to this strategic blow to the country’s most immediate and formidable military foe has recently revealed itself to be extraordinary. According to a Sunday report in the Financial Times (FT), over the last 18 years, Israel has managed to thoroughly infiltrate Hezbollah by any and all means, both human and electronic. Citing former Israeli intelligence officials and Lebanese politicians, the paper said that the breakthrough came in 2012, when Hezbollah leaped to aid Syrian leader Bashar al Assad put down an internal rebellion. They started publicly revealing information on their men that used to be top secret, said Yezid Sayigh, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center, becoming 'complacen[t]' and 'flabby.' Israel took the free information and then expanded their files on the senior members by old-fashioned methods such as having them followed, and newer means, like hacking their phones and breaking into Lebanese surveillance cameras. Israeli officials told FT that the IDF figured out that whenever the terrorists’ practices strayed from their ordinary routines, that meant they were expecting to attack Israel. This is what occurred on Friday, when military intelligence learned that Nasrallah was on his way to his fortified bunker, buried 60 feet under a civilian apartment building in Beirut that he used as his human shield – and the order was given to blast it with 80 tons of bombs. Nasrallah’s assassination perhaps put an exclamation point on the fact that due to its intelligence successes, over the last several weeks, Israel has almost completely decapitated the terrorist organization, seriously damaging its entire command structure. Twenty other senior terrorists were killed along with the Hezbollah chief in his bunker, while dozens of the highest-ranking commanders of Hezbollah’s most important units and sectors along Israel’s border have been eliminated by precision IAF airstrikes. This is besides some 3,000 mid-level Hezbollah fighters being injured and over two dozen killed by their exploding pagers and walkie talkies in an attack for which Israel has not claimed formal responsibility. Through years of painstaking aerial surveillance and work on the ground, the IDF has also built up a huge pool of worthy Hezbollah targets to hit. This has been on display throughout the last 11 months of war, as the air force and artillery have responded to the nearly 10,000 aerial attacks Hezbollah has launched since the Israel-Hamas war began, by striking terrorist military targets across Lebanon that have resulted in about 500 more terrorist deaths.

IDF special forces already operating in Lebanon – report	Elite units are making short intelligence raids in preparation for a ground invasion, says The Wall Street Journal. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News IDF forces are already secretly in Lebanon, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Elite units have been making short intelligence raids for weeks and even months, the paper said, in anticipation of acting on the necessity of permanently removing the Hezbollah terrorist organization from the border via a ground invasion. Their probes have included terror tunnels built by Hezbollah right up to Israel’s northern border, dug to enable its specialized Radwan force to invade the Galilee much as Hamas did on October 7, which sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. It is the fear of such a future invasion that has led some 60,000 residents of the north to say that they will refuse to return home until the threat is nullified. They have been internal refugees for nearly a year, with their lives in limbo ever since they were evacuated from their homes after Hezbollah immediately began launching thousands of rockets, missiles, and UAVs over the border to support Hamas. 'The IDF has made a lot of preparations for a ground incursion,' former senior military official Amir Avivi told the paper. 'Overall, this always includes special operations. This is part of the process.' It is still not certain when, and even if, the ground operation will commence, as the U.S. is putting heavy pressure on Israel not to enter full force. The Biden administration has been very forthright about its fear that this could lead to a regional war that included Iran, since Hezbollah is its most important terror proxy and Tehran has promised to help defend it from Israel. Various American government spokesmen have stated for weeks that the U.S. believes diplomacy can still work to de-escalate the volatile situation, even as Israel has ramped up its bombing of Hezbollah sites and senior personnel, including the assassination Friday of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. President Joe Biden said Sunday that he would soon be speaking to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu because 'we really have to avoid' what he called 'an all-out war' in the Middle East. 'We’re working like hell with the French and many others to avoid [more] war,' he told reporters. Most of Israel’s government and legislators, including from the Opposition, believe that now is the time to deal a very heavy, if not fatal blow to the terrorist group, up to and including holding onto a strip of Lebanese territory to ensure that Hezbollah cannot threaten the north as it as done for decades. The IDF has had immense success in recent weeks in decapitating Hezbollah’s military and political leadership, seriously damaging its communication network, and destroying thousands of missile launchers and tens of thousands of rockets. Last week alone, the air force hit over 2,000 targets in Lebanon, keeping up the relentless pressure. It came along with a clear threat to invade, as Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Herzi Halevi told some of the thousands of troops that Israel has brought northward in the last several days, who are now training for this scenario. 'We are preparing the process of a maneuver, which means your military boots, your maneuvering boots, will enter enemy territory,' he said.

‘Nasrallah assassination not the final step’ – Israel’s defense m...	If someone on the other side didn't understand what are capabilities entail, we mean all capabilities,' says Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. 'Eliminating Nasrallah was not the final step.' By World Israel News Staff Israel's Defense Minister hinted Monday at additional 'steps' against the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah, days after a massive airstrike on the organization's Beirut headquarters left its chief, Hassan Nasrallah, and nearly two dozen other operatives dead in the worst blow to the Iranian proxy in decades. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (Likud) visited Israel’s northern border on Monday, where he met with troops serving in the IDF's Brigade 188 and the Golani Brigade. Minister Gallant was briefed by commanders on the ground regarding the readiness of troops for the possibility of expanding activities in the northern arena. The Defense Minister also spoke to battalion and company commanders, who discussed their activities in Gaza and their deployment to the northern front. During his visit, Gallant alluded to new strikes against Hezbollah calling Friday's airstrike killing Nasrallah a 'very important step,' adding that it is 'not the final one.' 'The elimination of Nasrallah is a very important step, but it is not the final one,' said Gallant. 'We will employ all the capabilities at our disposal, and if someone on the other side did not understand what those capabilities entail, we mean all capabilities, and you are part of this effort. We trust you to accomplish every mission at hand.' 'Our goal is to ensure the [safe] return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes. We are prepared to make every effort necessary to accomplish this mission. We will use all the means that may be required – your forces, other forces, from the air, from the sea, and on land.'

Israel selects one Chief Rabbi but remains deadlocked on second	Halevi and Bar, both vying to replace Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi David Lau, currently serve as the Chief Ashkenazi Rabbis of Petah Tikva and Netanya respectively. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israel selected a Sephardi Chief Rabbis on Sunday night, ending a nearly three-month vacancy in the position, but failed to elect an Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi. The members of an assembly of 150 rabbinical figures, Knesset members, and local officials meeting in Jerusalem voted for Rabbi David Yosef, who teaches in Jerusalem, to succeed his brother, Rabbi David Yosef. Their faher, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, held the same position from 1973-1983. However, the assembly was unable to elect a Chief Ashkenazi Rabbi. From a field of five candidates, Rabbis Micha Halevi and Kalman Bar both secured 40 votes each, forcing a run-off vote. Halevi and Bar, both vying to replace Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi David Lau, currently serve as the Chief Ashkenazi Rabbis of Petah Tikva and Netanya respectively. It wasn’t immediately clear why the run-off could not be held immediately. No date was set for the second round of voting, but it is widely believed the run-off will take place about one week after Rosh HaShanah, the Jewish New Year. The holiday begins on Wednesday at sundown. The former Chief Rabbis stepped down from their positions on July 1 when their 10-year terms expired. It was the first time the positions were vacant. The Chief Rabbinate has jurisdiction over issues of personal status, such as marriage, divorce, conversions, as well as burials, kosher certification, holy sites, rabbinical courts, religious seminaries and ritual baths. The Chief Rabbis often represent Israel abroad. Religious affairs and issues of personal status such as marriage, divorce and conversion are determined by leaders of Israel’s recognized religious communities — Jewish, Muslim and Druze, as well as 10 Christian denominations. By law, elections for Chief Rabbis are supposed to be elected at least 21 days before the end of the previous rabbis’ term. A vote was originally supposed to be held in August 2023. But the Knesset postponed the vote, at the request of Religious Affairs Minister Michael Malkieli who argued that the timing would interfere with municipal elections scheduled for October 31. Critics accused Malkieli of trying to get individuals onto the assembly with more favorable views for certain candidates. But municipal elections were postponed to February when war with Hamas broke out. In August, the High Court of Justice ordered the assembly to meet by the end of September. Ten of the assembly’s 150 members were barred from voting because they were related to candidates, raising concerns for nepotism. Israel has two chief rabbis because Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews have distinct customs and interpretations of Jewish law. Ashkenazi Jews are primarily from Eastern and Central Europe while Sephardi Jews trace their roots to Spain, Portugal, North Africa, and the Middle East.

Air Haifa takes off—just not from the north, for now	The new Haifa-based airline will operate three fuel-efficient ATR 72-600 propeller planes to service the small Haifa runway. By Etgar Lefkovits, JNS It’s wheels up for Israel’s fourth airline. Air Haifa is scheduled to launch operations on Monday, though currently not out of its base in the northern Israeli port city due to the war against Hezbollah in Lebanon. The airline’s inauguration comes at a turbulent time for the Israeli aviation industry amid nearly a year of war, with many foreign carriers, including all three U.S. legacy airlines, still not flying to and from Tel Aviv, and many major European carriers who had resumed flights halting service anew this month due to the escalating security situation in the north. The new, low-cost airline, Israel’s first since the 1990s, will start service Monday morning with two daily domestic flights from Israel’s main airport near Tel Aviv to the southern Red Sea resort city of Eilat for 99 shekels ($27) each way until Oct. 11. Subject to the security situation, Air Haifa said it plans to begin operating the first flight from Haifa International Airport to Eilat after Yom Kippur on Oct. 13, and on Oct. 14 from Haifa to Cyprus. A one-way flight from Haifa to Eilat currently sells for 139 shekels, or about $38, while a ticket from Haifa to Larnaca is going for 239 shekels, or $65. The airline, which received final approval to fly this month and had its three airplanes and crew ready to go, decided not to delay its launch despite the flare-up in Lebanon making its planned flights out of Haifa temporarily impossible. Hezbollah has rained nearly 10,000 rockets on northern Israel since Oct. 8. 'When the war in Lebanon ends, servicing the north could be economically viable, but for now and in the short term there is no market for them,' Mark Feldman, Jerusalem director at Diesenhaus Tours, told JNS on Sunday. Last weekend, the European Commission and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) recommended airlines not fly to Israel and Lebanon through the end of October, prompting a new wave of airline cancellations ahead of the Jewish High holidays, in a move criticized as politically-motivated by Israeli aviation officials. Northern carrier The small Haifa airport, which is located at the eastern entrance to the city, was established by the British in 1934. It was the first international airport in Israel before the construction of Ben-Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv that same year. With a runway only 4,324 feet long, limiting plane size and range of destinations, the Haifa airport—even before the war began last year—has had very minimal service. The new Haifa-based airline will operate three fuel-efficient ATR 72-600 propeller planes to service the small Haifa runway. Air Haifa was founded last year by a team of entrepreneurial Israeli aviation professionals, led by the American-Israeli founder of cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks, Nir Zuk, together with former senior executives of the Jewish state’s flagship carrier, El Al Israel Airlines.

IDF intercepts explosive drone headed for offshore oil rig	Explosive drone launched likely launched by Hezbollah waws targeting Karish gas field, near Israel-Lebanon maritime border. By World Israel News Staff The IDF announced on Monday that it successfully intercepted an explosive drone off Israel’s territorial waters, which was likely en route to the Karish offshore gas rig. In a clip released by the military, an Israeli Navy missile boat is seen firing on the UAV, which was probably fired from Lebanon. Hezbollah has repeatedly threatened to target one of Israel’s most important sites for natural gas drilling, which is located in the Mediterranean Sea, near the maritime border with Lebanon. Following Israel’s retaliatory bombings of the Hudaydah Port in Yemen after numerous unprovoked attacks on Israel, the Houthis have pledged to target the Karish gas field. In July 2024, the Israeli Navy shot down a drone nearing the oil rig, though it was unclear if the UAV was explosive or being used for reconnaissance purposes. Throughout the ongoing war, various Iranian proxy groups - including Shia militias in Iraq and Syria, along with the Houthis - have attempted to attack Israel’s maritime assets. Several explosive drones have struck the Port of Eilat during the course of the conflict, most recently last week. The terror groups have also made multiple attempts to strike the ports of Haifa and Ashkelon. In July 2022, Hezbollah launched three attack drones at the Karish gas field, all of which were intercepted by the Israeli Navy. 'The message was delivered,' Hezbollah said at the time. In October 2022, the Israeli government led by then-Prime Minister Yair Lapid signed a contentious U.S.-brokered deal regarding the Karish gas field. The gas field had been claimed by both Lebanon and Israel, and the legal dispute over ownership meant that extracting gas from the resource was delayed. The deal, which some have argued Lapid did not have the legal authority to sign, saw profits from the field distributed between Israel and Lebanon.

Hamas commander in Lebanon killed in airstrike also worked for UN...	More than 100 survivors of Hamas’s October 7 attacks filed a $1 billion lawsuit against UNRWA in June, accusing the agency of 'aiding and abetting' the terror group. By Pesach Benson, TPS Hamas said on Monday that the commander of its forces in Lebanon, Fateh Sherif, was killed in an Israeli strike in the southern Lebanese city of Tyre. He was also an employee of the embattled United Nations Relief and Works Agency. Sherif was the principal of UNRWA’s Deir Yassin School in Tyre and also headed the UNRWA teacher’s union in Lebanon. UNRWA placed Sherif on administrative leave in March without publicly specifying why. Thousands of Palestinian students in Lebanese UNRWA schools went on strike and held sit-ins in protest. Israeli officials have yet to comment. UNRWA, which supports Palestinian refugees, has been under fire for months, with Israeli officials demanding the agency be stripped of its authority in Gaza and defunded amid revelations that members of the agency’s staff participated in Hamas’s October 7 attacks. The Israeli government is bypassing UNRWA in distributing humanitarian aid and advancing legislation to label the agency as a terror organization and remove its diplomatic immunity, tax-exempt status and other legal benefits. More than 100 survivors of Hamas’s October 7 attacks filed a $1 billion lawsuit against UNRWA in June, accusing the agency of 'aiding and abetting' the terror group. According to the suit, the lead plaintiff, 84-year-old Ditza Heiman of Kibbutz Nir Oz, was held captive for seven weeks in the home of a Palestinian man who said he was a UNRWA teacher at a boy’s school. Israel’s largest bank froze UNRWA’s account in February over suspicious financial transfers that the agency failed to adequately explain. That same month, Israeli forces discovered a Hamas complex located directly under the UNRWA’s Gaza City headquarters and connected directly to the agency’s electricity system. The facility included numerous computer servers belonging to the terror group. Palestinian refugees are the only refugee population with its own dedicated.UN agency. The rest of the world’s refugees fall under the mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Israeli officials have called for UNRWA to be closed and for Palestinian refugees to be brought under the responsibility of the UNHCR. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 97 remaining hostages, more than 30 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.

Report: US working with Israel to prepare for major Iranian repri...	The Biden administration fears Iran poised for major retaliatory strike on Israel following killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, and is working to prepare defenses in the region. By World Israel News Staff The U.S. is gearing up for a possible Iranian strike on Israel, CNN reported Sunday night, in response to the assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah on Friday. Nasrallah, who headed Hezbollah for the past 32 years, was killed, along with 20 other Hezbollah terrorists, when a squadron of Israeli F-16I fighter jets struck Hezbollah’s underground headquarters in Beirut, dropping over 80 heavy bombs on the complex. Citing a U.S. official, CNN reported that the Biden White House fears that Iran could attempt a major strike on Israel in retaliation for the killing of Tehran’s senior ally – and a close friend of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The U.S. is working jointly with Israel to prepare for a possible attack, the official said, while declining to specify what kinds of threats are considered realistic, and what preparations are being made. Over the weekend, the Pentagon dispatched American troops to Cyprus to assist with the evacuation of American citizens from the region should a full-scale war erupt between Israel and Hezbollah – or Iran. The U.S.S. Wasp, carrying F-35 stealth fighters, and its amphibious ready group, is deployed in the Eastern Mediterranean, ready to respond should a wider conflict break out. In addition, the Navy has dispatched the U.S.S. Harry S. Truman, a Nimitz-class nuclear-powered super carrier, to bolster American assets in the area. Last week, the U.S. and France pushed a proposed 21-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, amid reports citing U.S. officials that such a truce was on the verge of going into effect following a breakthrough in talks. One official told CNN last Wednesday that approved a statement which said a ceasefire was in the offing. However, Israeli officials said there was an 'honest misunderstanding,' that Jerusalem had understood the French-American effort as the 'start of a process,' not the signaling an agreement was in the immediate future.

‘We can’t go back to pre-October 7th reality’ – Northerners	Residents of Kiryat Shmona wary about casualties from potential ground invasion, but urge decisive military victory over Hezbollah. By World Israel News Staff IDF soldiers and residents of Israel's north are gearing up for a ground invasion of Lebanon, expressing that the move is critical for a decisive military victory over Hezbollah that would facilitate the return of the some 60,000 displaced and rehabilitation of the region. Kiryat Shmona, the northernmost city in Israel, was evacuated shortly after the October 7th Hamas massacres. Since then, the city has endured near-daily missile, rocket, and explosive drone attacks that have damaged hundreds of homes and businesses. Though Kiryat Shmona was officially evacuated, a small number of residents chose to remain. IDF Major A, who was identified only by his first initial, stayed in Kiryat Shmona to guard the city as part of his reserve duty. His family relocated to Gush Etzion, near Jerusalem. 'It's strange to drive along these roads, the way I used to take my kids to school and after-school activities, and see all these Shi'ite villages in the distance where they are shooting anti-tank misiles at us,' A told Ynet. 'We can't go back to the reality where we're constantly wondering if we're under threat' from Lebanese villages directly adjacent to the border, he added. Lilach Saadia, the manger of Nehamiah Mall who did not leave the city, told Ynet that arriving at the shopping center each morning 'is like a punch to the stomach all over again.' Saadia explained that all of the mall's business, save for the Super-Pharm drugstore, have been shuttered for nearly a year. 'Seeing the display windows with last year's Rosh HaShana specials' is a stark reminder that Kiryat Shmona has become a ghost town, she said. Unlike many other residents of the north, Saadia is wary of a potential ground invasion of Lebanon. 'If there's one thing I don't want, it's that,' she said. Her nephew, IDF soldier Liran Saadia, was killed as he participated in a ground incursion during the Second Lebanon War in 2006. 'Every time I hear calls for a ground invasion, I think about the price that comes with that.'

IDF turned down opportunity to kill Hamas chief – report	Israel's military reportedly had a clear shot at assassinating Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, but declined to take advantage of it, fearing it would lead to deaths of Israeli hostages used as human shields. By World Israel News Staff The Israeli military had a clear shot at eliminating the chief of Hamas forces in the Gaza Strip, but turned down the opportunity amid fears an assassination would risk the lives of Israeli hostages being used as human shields, a Hebrew-language report published Sunday claimed. On Sunday night, Israel's Channel 12 published an exclusive report claiming that the IDF had received intelligence which placed it in the position to carry out an operation to kill Yahya Sinwar, the 61-year-old commander of Hamas' Gaza forces and since August, chairman of the terror group's politburo. Sinwar, who went into hiding early on in the current war, is believed to be living in Hamas' massive underground terror tunnel network beneath the Gaza Strip, moving from one makeshift subterranean saferoom to another to avoid capture by the IDF. The terror chief is also reportedly keeping a number of Israeli captives in his immediate proximity at all times, using them as human shields to discourage the IDF from attempting to assassinate him. Last week, multiple Hebrew media outlets reported that the IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate is unsure whether Sinwar is still alive, with some within the MID arguing that the Hamas leader died in an airstrike several months ago. While some within the Directorate have questioned this view, advocates say the lack Sinwar's months-long silence and indications messages written in his name were penned by others indicate he was likely killed. Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency has reportedly criticized this assessment, with the agency believing Sinwar to be still be alive and operating out of the Gaza Strip. Senior IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said last Monday that he had no clear information to confirm either that Sinwar was killed or is still alive. 'I cannot confirm, and cannot deny' said Hagari. 'I do not have information that he is dead.'

‘An extraordinary leader’ – Ex-MK mourns Nasrallah	Former Israeli MK offers tribute to slain Hezbollah chief on Facebook, calling him a 'champion for the oppressed.' By World Israel News Staff A former member of the Israeli parliament released a statement praising slain Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, calling the arch-terrorist 'a hero for the oppressed.' EX-MK Issam Makhoul, who served iFn the Knesset from 1999-2006 as part of the Arab-Jewish communist Hadash party, penned an ode to Nasrallah on Facebook after news of his killing. Referring to him by the Islamic honorific 'Sayyed,' Mahoul posted that Nasrallah was an 'extraordinary leader' and 'hero to the oppressed.' Makhoul said Nasrallah had been a champion for those 'struggling for national and social liberation.' Nasrallah's legacy will be superior to that of 'his assassins, the petty politicians and military men obsessed with war and war crimes,' Makhoul added. Since leaving politics, Makhoul has worked as an intermediary between communist groups in Israel and the Chinese Communist Party. In 2011, Mahoul's brother Ameer was convicted of spying on behalf of Hezbollah. He served nine years in prison and was released in 2019. When Hebrew-language news outlet Walla asked asked Makhoul for comment on an article about the post, the former politician stood by his words. The Facebook post 'was an analysis of the event, the person, its impact, its importance, its nature and the meaning of the' assassination, Makhoul told Walla. 'I don't think it's possible to disagree on&#8230;Nasrallah's credibility, which surpasses Netanyahu's credibility in the eyes of the Israelis themselves.' Lina Makhoul, a popular Arab-Israeli singer, also triggered backlash with her social media posts around Nasrallah's assassination. In recent years, Makhoul has leveraged her platform to promote pro-Hamas rhetoric, leading to her becoming increasingly isolated from the mainstream Israeli pop world. When Nasrallah's fate after the bombing was still unknown, Makhoul posted 'May Allah protect him' on her Instagram account. Despite being an Israeli citizen, Makhoul describes herself in her Instagram bio as being '100 percent Palestinian.'

Sa’ar to re-enter Israel’s Netanyahu-led government	Sa’ar’s entry into the coalition as minister-without-portfolio was unanimously approved by government ministers, By JNS New Hope Party leader Gideon Sa’ar will re-enter the Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the two announced in a joint press statement on Sunday night. 'When war broke out, I immediately set about establishing a broad and stable government. I greatly appreciated it when Benny Gantz and Gideon Sa’ar joined the government and I regretted it when they left,' Netanyahu said of the wartime coalition formed on Oct. 11, 2023, in the aftermath of Hamas’s massacre in southern Israel. 'For this reason, I appreciate it that Gideon Sa’ar acceded to my request and agreed to return to the government today,' the premier added. 'This move contributes to unity among us, and unity against our enemies.' Sa’ar, who will join as a member of the Security Cabinet, noted his up-and-down ties with the premier, marked by periods in which the two maintained 'a close and very good working relationship,' but also years of 'political and personal rift.' 'Believe me, beloved citizens of Israel, since the morning of Saturday, October 7, this is meaningless to me,' said Sa’ar in reference to the Hamas invasion. 'In light of the current situation, and after consideration, I concluded that there is no point in me continuing to sit in the opposition, where the positions of most of its members on the subject of the war are different and even far removed from mine,' said Sa’ar. Sa’ar’s entry into the coalition as minister-without-portfolio was unanimously approved by government ministers, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said following the official announcement. Once a member of Netanyahu’s Likud Party, Sa’ar launched New Hope in 2020, ahead of Israel’s fourth of five election rounds between 2019 and 2022. He then served as justice minister in the government led by Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett. In the November 2022 general election, the shared Gantz and Sa’ar slate received 432,482 votes, resulting in 12 Knesset seats. Until two weeks ago, Sa’ar appeared set to replace Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, whom Netanyahu reportedly wanted to fire due to their differences on how to prosecute the war against Hamas and Hezbollah. Sa’ar announced his decision to quit the previous unity government on March 25, two weeks after breaking up his political alliance with Gantz’s National Unity Party. At the time, Sa’ar blamed the government for what he described as a failure to accomplish its war goals and said the military campaign against Hamas had been managed 'contrary to the national interest.' When Gantz left the unity government, Netanyahu made clear that his door would 'remain open to any Zionist party willing to shoulder the burden and help attain victory over our enemies and ensure the safety of our citizens.'

Israeli opposition party leaders push for ground invasion of Leba...	Gantz: 'An army of terror will not be deployed on our borders and threaten our citizens.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Following the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday, members of Israel's Opposition parties are encouraging a ground invasion of Lebanon to secure the border with Israel and to ensure the safe return of evacuees to their homes in the north. During a visit to kibbutz Kfar Giladi on the border with Lebanon, Democrats Party chairman Yair Golan said Israel should take control of the Lebanese village opposite so residents of the community 'would not be in the line of fire.' Golan said in an interview that evacuees will 'not be able to return to their homes if the terrorists are so close.' 'A ground invasion of Lebanon is necessary in order to ensure that there is no Hezbollah presence south of the Litani River,' Golan said. MK Avigdor Liberman, head of Yisrael Beytenu, said the Lebanese towns should be 'flattened' prior to an IDF invasion, and mines and tunnels should be neutralized. Regarding the civilians in these Lebanese communities, Liberman said there were 'no uninvolved people' and 'whoever remained there were Hezbollah members.' National Unity chairman MK Benny Gantz said that if diplomacy doesn't work and if a solid deal isn't possible, Israel's military should begin an invasion of Lebanon so that 'an army of terror will not be deployed on our borders and threaten our citizens.' Gantz added, 'The attack needs to be continuous, and the operation should be carried out speedily, continuously, and in a way that is lethal for Hezbollah.' Yesh Atid chairman MK Yair Lapid emphasized diplomacy, although he did not rule out a military solution. He said, 'In parallel to the operational activity, now is the right time to take a diplomatic step, when we have an advantage, when we are winning,' Lapid said. 'Our goal is a hostage deal in the South and a diplomatic agreement that will distance Hezbollah from the northern border,' he said. Lapid criticized the strategy in the Gaza war as a 'ground war without a diplomatic goal' and said Israel should 'get the Americans on board without quarreling with them.

Nasrallah died by suffocation – report	Gases released by the intensive bombing and poor ventilation might have combined to cause his death. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News According to a report by Channel 12 news, Hassan Nasrallah likely died of suffocation during an Israeli strike in Beirut on Friday. The notion that Nasrallah died from suffocation is deduced by the fact that his corpse was whole when it was exhumed rather than showing signs of fatal trauma from the airstrike. The report also speculated that the gases released by the intensive bombing and the poor ventilation in the underground area where Nasrallah was staying might have combined to cause his death. In addition to Hassan Nasrallah, 20 other Hezbollah terrorists were killed in the Israeli strike. Some of these terrorists included Ibrahim Hussein Jazini, the head of Nasrallah's Security Unit; Samir Tawfiq Dib, Nasrallah's long-time confidant and advisor on terrorist activities; Abed al-Amir Muhammad Sablini, Head of Hezbollah's Force-Build Up and Ali Naaf Ayoub - responsible for coordinating Hezbollah's firepower. Following the successful operation, the IDF released a statement: 'In a precise airstrike carried out by the Israeli Air Force, directed by the Intelligence Directorate, fighter jets struck and eliminated Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Hezbollah terrorist organization, and Ali Karaki, the Commander of Hezbollah's Southern Front, who was one of the remaining senior commanders in the organization before the strike.' A senior Hezbollah official, Nabil Qaouk, was killed in an IDF airstrike on Saturday in the Dahiyeh suburb of Beirut, the IDF announced on Sunday. Qaouk held a significant role within Hezbollah as the commander of its 'preventive security unit' and was a senior figure on the group's central council. The IDF spokesperson's division said that Qaouk was closely aligned with Hezbollah's leadership and had recently played a key role in planning attacks against Israel and its citizens. Also on Sunday, Hezbollah confirmed the death of Ali Karaki, the commander of the Southern Front, which oversees the group's military operations in southern Lebanon along the Israeli border. Karaki was killed, along with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, in a large-scale Israeli airstrike on Beirut on Friday. Karaki had survived an earlier Israeli assassination attempt earlier that week.

Former British Commander: ‘No Western military has achieved what ...	Kemp said the elimination of Hezbollah's command structure has 'undermined the capability to launch large-scale coordinated attacks.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Former Commander of the British forces in Afghanistan, Col. Richard Kemp, said no Western country's military has achieved 'anything even remotely close' to the progress Israel has made against Hezbollah in Lebanon the last two weeks. Speaking to Arutz Sheva following the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Kemp said, 'Israel's rapid attrition against Hezbollah in the last two weeks is unprecedented in any military campaign that I know of.' He continued,'Certainly, no other Western country has achieved anything even remotely close in any modern war.' He added, 'The damage done to Hezbollah's leadership by precision airstrikes as well as the pager attacks must be added to repeated strikes by the IDF since Hezbollah began its unprovoked war of aggression nearly a year ago.' 'Key leaders have been progressively eliminated throughout that time as well as the destruction of significant quantities of Hezbollah's weapons capability,' Kemp explained. Although Hezbollah may have a large number of missiles and drones as well as terrorists who are still fighting for Hezbollah and can be replaced, the extensive losses to Hezbollah's chain of command have caused irreparable damage to the terror organization' ability to function. Kemp explained, 'Any military or terrorist organization does depend heavily on a command structure, and the elimination of so much of that will have seriously undermined the capability to launch large-scale coordinated attacks.' Even though Nasrallah has been replaced by his cousin, Hashem Safieddine, who has extensive experience with the terror organization, Kemp said it would be hard to replace a leader like Nasrallah, who has headed Hezbollah for over three decades. In addition, given the losses to Hezbollah's command structure and the psychological blow dealt the terror organization by the beeper incident that wounded thousands, Hezbollah's ability to recruit new members may have been hampered. Kemp said, 'There is also a psychological element for those who might be thinking of stepping up. They were stunned by the pagers episode and are reeling daily from what is befalling their bosses. How many will want to step up to the plate against the fear that they will be next.'

Republican attorneys general back lawsuit charging Americans for ...	The suit seeks to hold the anti-Israel groups accountable under the Anti-Terrorism Act for allegedly 'providing material support to Hamas,' according to the AGs' brief. By Jessica Costescu, The Washington Free Beacon A group of Republican attorneys general has filed an amicus brief backing a lawsuit against American Muslims for Palestine and National Students for Justice in Palestine, the anti-Israel groups accused of providing material support to Hamas. The coalition of 22 attorneys general, led by Virginia's Jason Miyares and Iowa's Brenna Bird, filed the brief late last week, urging the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to 'decline to dismiss' a lawsuit brought on by survivors and family members of those killed by Hamas on Oct. 7. The defendants stand accused of serving as 'the propaganda and recruiting wing of a Foreign Terrorist Organization in the United States.' American Muslims for Palestine and National Students for Justice in Palestine have galvanized anti-Israel and anti-Semitic activists across the country in the wake of Oct. 7, calling for a 'Unity Intifada' against the Jewish state and vowing to 'contribute to the fight for Palestinian liberation.' The suit seeks to hold the anti-Israel groups accountable under the Anti-Terrorism Act for allegedly 'providing material support to Hamas,' according to the AGs' brief. 'Attorneys General, as their States' chief law enforcement officers, have a deep interest in holding terrorists and their supporters accountable,' says the brief. 'That accountability helps ensure that citizens of their States receive financial compensation from the individuals and organizations who supported the terrorists that engaged in the horrific attacks that harmed family members and loved ones—fully acknowledging that no amount of financial compensation can ever make up for the tragic losses these citizens have experienced.' Miyares and Bird told the Washington Free Beacon that organizations that abuse their 'nonprofit' status to promote terrorism must be held accountable. 'Sunlight is the best disinfectant and we are working to get to the truth. Groups such as AMP and NSJP are alleged to have abused their nonprofit status in order to promote Hamas' dangerous ideological campaign of hatred,' Miyares said. 'Their inconsistent financial reporting, particularly in Virginia, raises serious concerns about whether donations to these organizations are in fact being funneled to support activities far from their publicly stated mission.' 'It is not only despicable but illegal for any person or group to provide support to terrorists. I stand with the victims and families whose loved ones were murdered on October 7,' Bird added. 'They deserve the chance to take their fight against terrorism to court and to hold accountable any group that leverages its 'nonprofit' status to act as Hamas foot soldiers and promote terrorism.' In Virginia, where American Muslims for Palestine is based, Miyares opened a separate investigation in October probing allegations that the organization maintains fundraising ties to Hamas. Salah Sarsour, one of the group's board members, is alleged to have played a direct role in raising funds for a Hamas front group in the late 1990s, according to an FBI memorandum. A judge ordered the group in July to disclose its funding channels. Virginia and Iowa are joined by attorneys general from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia. American Muslims for Palestine and National Students for Justice in Palestine did not respond to requests for comment.

Game-changing 3D-printed virus detector promises quicker diagnosi...	This technological advance promises to change how viruses are monitored and managed in healthcare settings, providing a rapid, accurate, and portable tool for health professionals. By Pesach Benson, TPS Israeli and German researchers unveiled a groundbreaking new method for detecting viruses and nanoparticles that offers faster, more accurate results at a fraction of the cost of traditional techniques. The method combines advanced microscopy techniques with a 3D-printed setup. Its portable nature means it can be deployed in hospitals, clinics, and even mobile units in remote or underserved areas, making virus detection accessible in places where advanced lab facilities might not be available. This innovative approach, led by Prof. Dr. Eitan Lerner of the Hebrew University, PhD candidate Mrs. Paz Drori, and colleagues from Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich and the Technical University of Dortmund, combines advanced microscopy techniques with a 3D-printed setup. Traditionally, virus detection relies heavily on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods, which, while highly accurate, can be time-consuming and require specialized lab equipment. In contrast, antigen-based tests, though quicker, tend to lack the precision and sensitivity needed to reliably detect small quantities of virus. The new method developed by Lerner’s team addresses these shortcomings by offering a faster, more cost-effective alternative capable of identifying single virus particles with great accuracy. The team’s approach merges confocal fluorescence microscopy with microfluidic laminar flow, an innovative technique allowing researchers to examine nanoparticles and viruses in real time. This combination of technologies is further enhanced by a 3D-printed microscopy device, known as Brick-MIC, which offers a portable and affordable solution for virus detection. Brick-MIC uses laminar flow within a microfluidic channel to direct the movement of viruses or nanoparticles, while fluorescent dyes and labeled antibodies help distinguish specific virus particles with unparalleled sensitivity. The development of this method also saw collaboration with Prof. Dr. Thorben Cordes’ group from Ludwig-Maximilians University and the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR). Together, the teams were able to test the technology on both fluorescent beads and real viruses, including those carrying the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. These trials demonstrated the system’s high level of accuracy and specificity in detecting clinically relevant virus concentrations. One of the critical innovations of this method is its hydrodynamic focusing capability, which significantly boosts sensitivity and allows for the detection of viruses at low concentrations—something crucial for clinical and diagnostic applications. This technological advance promises to change how viruses are monitored and managed in healthcare settings, providing a rapid, accurate, and portable tool for health professionals. During viral outbreaks or pandemics, the technology could be used for mass screening in airports, schools, or workplaces. It could also be integrated into public health infrastructure for continuous monitoring of viral outbreaks in real time, allowing for faster responses and better containment strategies. In addition, the ability to detect specific virus strains at a nanoparticle level would allow for more personalized healthcare interventions. For example, doctors could use this technology to better understand the virus type affecting an individual, allowing for more precise and effective treatments, such as antiviral drugs or vaccines suited to the specific pathogen. Patients with chronic conditions or weakened immune systems could benefit from regular health monitoring using this rapid detection system, enabling early intervention before infections worsen. The system could be used to regularly screen for viruses in high-risk environments like hospitals, especially in ICU wards, to prevent hospital-acquired infections. It would help in quickly identifying viral threats and isolating infected patients to protect vulnerable populations. Routine use of the technology could also ensure that healthcare workers are not unknowingly carrying viruses. Studies on this new approach to detecting viruses were recently published in the peer-reviewed iScience and Science Advances journals.

Israeli fighter jets strike Houthi terror assets in Yemen	The purpose of the attack is to exact a heavy price for the attacks by the Houthis. If they continue to attack Israel, the attacks will increase,' an Israeli official said. By JNS Israeli Air Force fighter jets carried out dozens of airstrikes on Houthi terrorist targets in Yemen’s port city of Hodeidah on Sunday afternoon, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed in a statement. 'In a large-scale operation, dozens of Air Force aircraft, including fighter jets, refueling and intelligence planes, under the direction of the Military Intelligence Directorate, attacked military targets of the Houthi terrorist regime in the areas of Ras Issa and Hodeidah in Yemen,' the IDF said. 'The IDF attacked power plants and a seaport, which are used to import oil,' according to the military statement. 'The attack was carried out in response to the latest attacks carried out by the Houthi regime against the State of Israel,' it added. 'The Houthi terrorist regime has been operating under the direction and funding of Iran and in cooperation with Iraqi militias, in order to harm the State of Israel, undermine regional order, and disrupt freedom of navigation.' #BREAKING: Reports that #Israel conducted another strike on the Port of Hodeidah in #Yemen which is used by #IRGCterrorists and the #Houthis for weapons smuggling. Follows a previous strike there and a couple of Houthi attacks targeting Tel Aviv and Ben Gurion Airport. pic.twitter.com/MrSaq3Cq5i &mdash; Jason Brodsky (@JasonMBrodsky) September 29, 2024 Unnamed senior officials in Jerusalem told Israel’s Channel 12 that the damage following the airstrikes was 'enormous,' adding that it will take the Houthis 'a long time' to recover from the unprecedented attack. 'The purpose of the attack is to exact a heavy price for the attacks by the Houthis. If they continue to attack Israel, the attacks will increase,' an Israeli official told the country’s Ynet outlet. 'The message to Iran is that Israel can attack with tremendous power even at a distance of 2,000 kilometers [≈1,200 miles]. It can do it simultaneously in several arenas. 'Today, we attacked in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen,' the official said. The leader of the Houthis, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, on Saturday night claimed that a surface-to-surface missile it had launched at central Israel hours earlier was timed to coincide with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s return to the Jewish state from the United States. The IDF announced that the military’s aerial defense array had downed the Houthi terrorist missile 'outside of the country’s borders.' In a televised speech, the Houthi leader also vowed that the targeted killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut on Friday would 'not be in vain.' Yemen’s Houthi militia, an Iranian proxy force, have launched multiple attacks on the Jewish state in support of Hamas in the wake of the Gaza terror group’s Oct. 7 invasion of southern Israel. Israel’s 'Arrow' defense system intercepted a surface-to-surface ballistic missile fired at the Jewish state from Yemen on Friday, according to the Israel Defense Forces. On Sept. 15, Israeli air defenses intercepted fragments of a surface-to-surface missile launched from Yemen that exploded over central Israel. In July, a Houthi suicide drone killed an Israeli civilian in central Tel Aviv, in response to which Israel struck Hodeidah port in a major attack.

Top Hezbollah commander killed in latest IDF airstrike, 20 others...	Sheik Nabil Qaouk, commander of Hezbollah's security unit, killed in additional round of IDF airstrikes on Hezbollah positions in Beirut. By World Israel News Staff A senior Hezbollah official, Nabil Qaouk, was killed in an IDF airstrike on Saturday in the Dahiyeh suburb of Beirut, the IDF announced on Sunday The strike is part of Israel’s ongoing military offensive against the Iranian-backed Hezbollah terror group. Qaouk held a significant role within Hezbollah as the commander of its 'preventive security unit' and was a senior figure on the group’s central council. The IDF spokesperson’s division said that Qaouk was closely aligned with Hezbollah’s leadership and had recently played a key role in planning attacks against Israel and its citizens. Qaouk's involvement with Hezbollah dates back to the 1980s. The 60-year-old cleric and Hezbollah commander had previously served as the deputy head and later the chief of the southern Lebanon region on Hezbollah’s executive council, along with holding the position of deputy head of the same council. Also on Sunday, Hezbollah confirmed the death of Ali Karaki, the commander of the Southern Front, which oversees the group’s military operations in southern Lebanon along the Israeli border. Karaki was killed, along with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, in a large-scale Israeli airstrike on Beirut on Friday. Karaki had survived an earlier Israeli assassination attempt earlier that week. Both Nasrallah and Karaki were killed Friday when a squadron of Israeli F-16I fighter jets dropped over 80 bombs, including heavy bunker busters, onto Hezbollah headquarters in Beirut, demolishing the complex’s subterranean fortifications. More than 20 other terrorists were killed in Friday's strike, the IDF said, identifying a number of prominent Hezbollah operatives eliminated in the attack, including Nasrallah confidants Ibrahim Hussein Jazini and Samir Tawfiq Dib, as well as other senior Hezbollah officials including Abed al-Amir Muhammad Sablini and Ali Naaf Ayoub. Meanwhile, the IDF reported that Israeli fighter jets conducted airstrikes late Saturday night and early Sunday morning on multiple Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, including rocket launchers aimed at Israel and buildings used to store weapons. Hezbollah terrorists operating out of southern Lebanon launched a barrage of rockets on northern Israel Sunday morning, targeting the Galilee, including the city of Tiberias.

Biden’s defense secretary outraged after Israel gave minimal noti...	Secretary of State Lloyd Austin reportedly fuming after Israel only informed US of impending airstrike against Hezbollah headquarters after the jets were already airborne. By World Israel News Staff U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was outraged with his Israeli counterpart over the weekend, according to a report by The Jerusalem Post, after Israel gave the Biden administration only minimal prior notice before the airstrike that killed Hezbollah chairman Hassan Nasrallah Friday. A squadron of Israeli F-16I fighter jets pounded Hezbollah headquarters in Beirut on Friday, dropping over 80 bombs, including heavy bunker busters, on the complex's fortified subterranean saferooms. While Israel did inform the U.S. prior to the strike itself, the notice was reportedly given only minutes before the bombings began and after the fighter planes were already airborne and en route to their target. While Israeli Defense Minister Gallant has since October 7th consistently kept Austin updated on major military actions, recently, Israel has at times declined to inform the Biden administration of impending actions, including a string of pager and radio bombings earlier this month targeting thousands of Hezbollah operatives. According to senior American officials, the Biden administration had no foreknowledge of the attacks. Nevertheless, Gallant and Austin have met more frequently than some of their predecessors due to the continuous crises brought on by the war, and they have maintained an exceptionally high level of communication, speaking by phone over 125 times, sometimes multiple times a day. Despite the strong rapport that has developed between them, Austin was reportedly incensed by the last-minute notice of the Nasrallah operation. The core issue for Austin and the Biden administration throughout the conflict has been preventing a wider regional war, particularly one involving Hezbollah. Washington has repeatedly urged Israel to exercise restraint to avoid escalating tensions into a larger confrontation. In this instance, it appears Israel intentionally delayed informing the U.S. to avoid diplomatic pushback that might have pressured them to reconsider the operation. The decision to proceed without early coordination, especially given the expected U.S. opposition to such a high-risk move, further fueled Austin's personal frustration with Gallant, even though he generally views Gallant as one of the more pragmatic and reliable figures in Netanyahu's government, known for respecting U.S. counsel more than others.

Top Turkish newspaper calls for annihilation of Israel	Newspaper aligned with ruling Turkish party runs front page article advocating for the destruction of Israel, after President Erdogan called Israeli premier 'Hitler' from the podium of the UN. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A Turkish paper considered close to the regime of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan plastered a headline across its front page Sunday that said 'The world will not be safe until Israel is destroyed.' The article in Yeni Safak came as a direct response to the IDF assassination Friday night of Hezbollah terrorist leader Hassan Nasrallah in his bunker in Beirut. The paper claimed that 'images of the moment and aftermath of the attack revealed that Israel does not care about any moral code' accusing it of committing a 'massacre' as 'dozens of civilians' allegedly lost their lives in the airstrike. Israel has not commented on any civilian casualties who might have been caught in the bombing. The Jewish state had warned Lebanese citizens days ago to leave areas where Hezbollah terrorists were located, for their own safety. The IDF did say that several other terrorists were caught in the airstrike, which reportedly used some 80 one-ton bombs, including a few senior members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, Hezbollah’s chief backer and paymaster. The paper went on to list many of the senior Hezbollah, Hamas and Iranian military commanders that the IDF has recently eliminated, castigating the world for remaining silent over 'all these acts of terror.' It did not mention that the reason for Israel’s actions was the Hamas’ invasion of Israel and massacre of 1,200 people on October 7 that sparked the ongoing war in Gaza, and that Hezbollah has rained some 10,000 missiles, rockets and UAVs on the Jewish state since October 8 to support Hamas, acting as if Israel had decided out of the blue to attack its neighbors. Yeni Safak’s unfounded charges against Israel also included that it was committing 'genocide in Gaza,' that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now intends to 'start a major regional war,' and that Nasrallah had been assassinated 'under the name of the ‘New Order,’ with the 'goal of [re]designing the region.' The phrase 'New Order' cannot help but remind the world of Adolf Hitler’s use of the slogan for Nazi Germany. Turkish President Recep Erdogan often called Netanyahu 'Hitler,' even before the Israel-Hamas war began, but revved up his use of the epithet in recent months as his government’s strident pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel rhetoric has increased over the course of the war. On Wednesday, during his speech to the UN at the opening of the General Assembly, he again made the odious comparison when claiming that Israel was committing 'massacres' in Gaza. 'Just as Hitler was stopped by an alliance of humanity seventy years ago, Netanyahu and his murder network must be stopped by an alliance of humanity,' he said. The media in Turkey is almost completely under the thumb of the government. Turkey is among the world’s worst offenders in imprisoning journalists who don’t toe its political line, according to Reporters Without Border, with nearly 50 detained over the course of 2023.

Houthi terrorists launch ballistic missile at Israeli airport dur...	Pro-Iranian Yemenite terrorists claim ballistic missile attack on central Israel targeted Prime Minister Netanyahu's plane as it arrived at Ben Gurion Airport. By World Israel News Staff Iranian-backed Houthi rebels operating out of Yemen launched a ballistic missile towards Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plane as he returned to Israel from New York, a spokesman for the terrorist group claimed Saturday. A surface-to-surface ballistic missile launch from Yemen towards Israel was detected Saturday, the Israeli military announced. The missile was intercepted and destroyed before it reached Israeli airspace, an IDF spokesperson said, though a piece of the projectile landed on a road outside of Jerusalem, near the town of Tzur Hadassah, causing minor damage. The attack came just 35 minutes after the prime minister's state aircraft, a Boeing 767 dubbed the 'Wing of Zion', touched down at Ben Gurion International Airport. Shortly after the attack, Ameen Hayyan, a spokesman for the Houthi rebels, issued a statement saying that missile attack had directly targeted Netanyahu. 'The missile force in the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out an operation targeting what is [sic] Israeli called 'Ben Gurion,' Jaffa Airport, during the arrival of the criminal Benjamin Netanyahu,' Hayyan wrote. 'The operation was carried out with a Palestine 2 ballistic missile. The Yemeni Armed Forces, alongside all of the honorable and free people of the nation, continue to respond to the crimes of the Israeli enemy and will not hesitate to upraise the level of escalation in response to the requirements of the ongoing stage and to participate in defending Gaza and Lebanon.' 'These operations will not stop until the aggression on Gaza and Lebanon stops.' Like Hezbollah and Hamas, the Houthis are armed and supported financially by Tehran. Saturday's attack marks the third time in September that Houthi forces have launched ballistic missiles towards central Israel.

Iran ‘checkmated’ by Nasrallah killing, split over potential resp...	Iran's Supreme Leader releases cautious statement standing by Hezbollah, but refuses to commit to rescuing the terror group. By World Israel News Staff Iran’s senior leadership is currently roiled by internal debate on the country’s response to the assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. Over the past three decades, Tehran is believed to have invested billions of dollars in training and arming Hezbollah, making it the largest Iranian proxy group threatening Israel in the region. The Israeli Air Force airstrikes that killed Nasrallah last Friday night come days after beeper explosions - widely attributed to Israel - and intensive bombing campaigns throughout Lebanon seriously crippled Hezbollah’s military capabilities. According to a New York Times report, Iranian officials’ opinions are split as to how Tehran should proceed, following Nasrallah’s slaying. If Iran was to directly attack Israel, that would grant the Jewish State casus belli to strike sensitive sites inside of Iran, such as its nuclear development centers and oil fields. But failing to respond to Nasrallah's killing would make Iran appear weak in the eyes of its proxies and the Muslim world. Iran is 'completely checkmated by Israel at this moment,' Sanam Vakil, the director for Middle East at Chatham House, told the Times. Moderates, such as recently-elected President Masoud Pezeshkian, have signaled that they are in favor of a 'limited' response to the strike. Conversely, conservatives are urging Iran to assume a 'forceful' retaliatory posture. 'Israel has attacked the nucleus cell of the resistance and thus we cannot be indifferent,' said an influential cleric, Ayatollah Mohammad Hassan Akhtari. Ultimately, all decisions are made by Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei. 'All of the forces in the resistance stand by Hezbollah,' Khamenei said in a recent public statement. 'It will be Hezbollah, at the helm of the resistance forces, that will determine the fate of the region.' Those remarks are notable, as they could indicate that Iran is unwilling to intervene in order to save Hezbollah, as the terror group endures ongoing blows from Israel. 'Khamenei’s statement is indicative of the gravity of the moment and the caution,' Vakil said. 'He is not publicly committing to anything that he can’t deliver.' According to the Times report, Iranian dissidents and others who have suffered at the hands of the Islamic Regime quietly celebrated Nasrallah's killing. In some cities, sweets were distributed in celebration of the Hezbollah chief's assassination.

‘Genocide Lover’ – Anti-Israel vandals trash NY congressman’s off...	The epithets accused Rep. Adriano Espaillat of being a 'genocide lover' and had a Hamas’ inverted 'targeting' triangle painted on the window. By Batya Jerenberg, World Israel News A New York congressman’s office was covered in anti-Israel graffiti Thursday night, with police immediately opening an investigation to find the culprits. Democrat Adriano Espaillat, who represents the heavily-Jewish neighborhood of Washington Heights in the northern part of the New York City, is a strong Israel supporter. He has had the posters of many hostages hanging prominently in his office-front window for many months. Small groups of Hamas supporters have regularly picketed the place. According to surveillance videos the police examined, the crime was committed around 11 pm. The words 'Terrorist,' 'F*** Israel,' 'genocide lover' and '40K dead' were spraypainted in red across the window and glass door, along with an inverted triangle that Hamas has used in its propaganda to denote that it is targeting the building or person it pictures. Down the same street and a nearby subway entrance, the vandals had also sprayed the red triangle, 'Free Gaza,' 'F*** Israel NYPD Cop City,' and 'A terrorist in uniform is still a terrorist.' The protective metal shutter that usually covers the entrance to Espaillat’s district office had been vandalized in November as well, soon after the posters had been hung. The graffiti there had read in black paint, 'Espaillat is complicit in genocide,' 'No more aid to Israel!' and 'Free Palestine!' The vandalism was committed just hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had addressed the opening of the General Assembly of the UN and defended Israel’s right to destroy both the Hamas and Hezbollah terrorist groups that have been attacking the Jewish state since October 7, 2023. A group of anti-Israel organizations had held a joint protest before his speech near the United Nations building, carrying signs with such slogans as 'End the War Now,' and an effigy of the prime minister with handcuffed, 'bloody' red hands. Espaillat is not the only New York congressman to be targeted in this way. Also in November, Brooklyn Rep. Dan Goldman’s office was defaced with slogans such as 'Blood on ur [sic] hands' and 'Let Gaza live.' On Christmas, employees in the South Bronx office of outspoken Israel defender Rep. Ritchie Torres found a doll outside the door covered with red paint that was called 'a Palestinian child messiah.' Torres immediately called it out on X as an attempt by anti-Israel extremists to scare him off, but said, 'I, for one, will not be intimidated.' That same week, GOP Rep.

Lebanon declares three days of mourning for ‘great martyr’ Nasral...	The funeral of the great martyr will be a day of work stoppage in all public administrations, municipalities, and public and private institutions,' according to a government statement. By JNS The Lebanese government has declared a three-day mourning period for Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, CNN Arabic reported on Saturday. Nasrallah was killed in an Israel Defense Forces strike on Hezbollah’s headquarters in Beirut on Friday evening. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati announced that the government would observe an official mourning period from Monday through Wednesday, which would include the lowering of flags to half-mast. 'The funeral of the great martyr will be a day of work stoppage in all public administrations, municipalities, and public and private institutions,' according to a government statement. At the start of Saturday’s government meeting, Mikati called on lawmakers to 'observe a moment of silence.' He said that his government 'is doing everything in its power to confront this destructive, hateful war waged by Israel.' 'The law of the jungle that rules the world has made the Israeli enemy thwart all ceasefire efforts and continue its war against Lebanon,' Mikati said.

‘Father figure’: Mainstream media eulogize Hezbollah butcher Nasr...	Many in the Middle East had a different reaction. By Adam Kredo, The Washington Free Beacon Following Hassan Nasrallah's death at the hands of an Israeli airstrike, mainstream media outlets portrayed the now-former Hezbollah leader as an erudite 'father figure,' a 'moral compass,' a 'savior,' and a 'roly-poly figure' who 'empowered' Lebanon's 'downtrodden.' The vast majority failed to mention that he was a brutal terrorist leader who killed scores of Americans, Israelis, and innocent civilians across the Middle East. Nasrallah rose to the top of the terror organization in February 1992. A month later, Hezbollah operatives killed 29 people in a suicide bombing attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires. The terror group's subsequent 1994 attack on the AMIA Jewish community center in Buenos Aires killed 85. The aftermath of the 1994 Jewish center bombing in Buenos Aires. (Ali Burafi/Agence France-Presse—Getty Images) In 1983, one year after Nasrallah helped found Hezbollah, the terror organization murdered 32 Lebanese, 17 Americans, and 14 visitors in its bombing of the U.S. embassy in Beirut. The attack's planners became commanders under Nasrallah, who died a rich man, carrying a net worth of $250 million thanks mostly to illicit drug smuggling. The aftermath of the U.S. embassy bombing in Beirut. (State Department) Most of those details were left out of lengthy obituaries published in the Washington Post, New York Times, and Associated Press. The Post lauded Nasrallah's 'folksy yet articulate manner' and described the terrorist as a 'savior' among his followers. The Times billed Nasrallah as a 'charismatic religious and political leader and military strategist who had dedicated his life to ‘resistance,’ or the fight against Israel.' The AP lamented the Jewish state's dangerous 'escalation' in killing Nasrallah and called him a 'charismatic and shrewd strategist.' The Washington Free Beacon compiled a roundup of passages from the three obituaries: Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah leader and force in Middle East, is killed (Washington Post) 'Hasan Nasrallah, a Shiite cleric who oversaw the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for decades and became one of the most powerful and divisive leaders in the Middle East, revered by his followers as a savior and condemned by his foes as a terrorist, died Sept. 27 in Beirut.' 'Among his followers, Mr. Nasrallah was seen as a father figure, a moral compass and a political guide. He was lauded as the man who empowered Lebanon’s once downtrodden and impoverished Shiite community and protected it from Israeli incursions by turning Hezbollah into a formidable deterrent force.' 'Wearing the black turban that signifies descent from the prophet Muhammad, he delivered advice on topics ranging from complicated regional events to personal hygiene during the covid pandemic, sometimes speaking for hours without notes, always in the folksy yet articulate manner that established him as a skilled orator.' 'The death of his 18-year-old son, Hadi, in a battle with Israel in 1997 burnished Mr. Nasrallah’s leadership credentials, establishing him as a man who had shared in the suffering of those battling the Israeli occupation.' 'He and his wife, Fatima Yassin, are believed to have had four other children. A list of survivors was not immediately available.' Hassan Nasrallah, Who Led Hezbollah for Decades, Killed at 64 (New York Times) 'In Lebanon, Mr. Nasrallah enjoyed tremendous devotion from Hezbollah’s Shiite Muslim base, who saw in him a charismatic religious and political leader and military strategist who had dedicated his life to 'resistance,' or the fight against Israel and American influence in the Middle East.' 'He came across as less dour than most Shiite clerics, partly because of his roly-poly figure, a slight lisp and a propensity to crack jokes. He never pushed hard-line Islamic rules, like veils for women in the neighborhoods that Hezbollah controls.' 'He could be by turns avuncular and menacing.' 'In his broadcasts, Mr. Nasrallah always appeared tranquil, assured, sincere and well informed, in command of both the facts and the situation, utterly dedicated to his cause and to his men. He was aloof yet tried to lend his secretive, heavily armed organization an air of transparency by sharing battlefield details.' (This passage, which can be viewed here, appears to have been removed.) 'He was known to have read the autobiographies of Israel’s prime ministers. He had long called for the liberation of Jerusalem and referred to Israel as 'the Zionist entity,' maintaining that all Jewish immigrants should return to their countries of origin and that there should be one Palestine with equality for Muslims, Jews and Christians.' Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah transformed the militant group into a potent regional force (Associated Press) 'Seen by his supporters as a charismatic and shrewd strategist, Nasrallah had reshaped Hezbollah into an archenemy of Israel, cementing alliances with the ayatollahs in Tehran and Palestinian militant groups such as Hamas.' 'A fiery orator viewed as an extremist in the U.S. and much of the West, as well as in some oil-rich Gulf Arab countries, he was also considered a pragmatist compared with the firebrand militants who dominated Hezbollah after its founding in 1982, during Lebanon’s civil war.' 'Idolized by his Lebanese Shiite followers and respected by millions of others across the Arab and Islamic world, Nasrallah held the title of sayyid, an honorific meant to signify the Shiite cleric’s lineage dating back to the Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam.' 'Wearing spectacles and sporting a bushy gray beard like many religious Shiite men, Nasrallah’s image was far from that of a militant who commanded thousands of heavily armed, well-trained and battle-hardened followers.' 'He often paused in his speeches to make jokes or break into local dialect and once, responding to a reporter asking about his monthly salary during a television interview, Nasrallah said it was about $1,300.' Some Democratic officials expressed their dismay at the Israeli strike that killed Nasrallah. Anti-Semitic Rep. Rashida Tlaib (R., Mich) condemned the attack as a 'bloodbath,' saying 'the U.S. government are conspirators to the war criminal Netanyahu's genocidal plan.' Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called for a 'diplomatic solution,' saying during a CNN interview that an 'all-out war between Lebanese Hezbollah and Israel would be devastating for both Lebanon and Israel. And again, we anticipate that we’d see a number of people displaced, casualties that, you know, equal or exceed what we’ve seen in Gaza.' Many in the Middle East had a different reaction. Syrians in the country's northwestern area, for example, were seen celebrating in the streets and handing out candy following early reports of Nasrallah's death. Nasrallah was crucial in defeating the Syrian revolution, backing the country's dictator, Bashar al Assad, as he massacred hundreds of thousands of civilians.

Israeli Navy intercepts drone over Red Sea	Since October, the Houthis have launched hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel. By Pesach Benson, TPS The Israeli Navy intercepted a drone fired toward Israel from the direction of the Red Sea, the Israel Defense Forces said on Sunday morning. Sirens sounded in the Red Sea resort city of Eilat and surrounding areas. The drone, presumably launched by Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, was shot down by an Israeli Navy Saar 4.5 missile corvette 'outside the country’s borders.' Following the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike on Friday, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, leader of the Yemeni terror group vowed to take revenge. 'We will move towards escalation and developing our military performance,' al-Houthi said in televised remarks. Since October, the Houthis have launched hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel. The Houthis vowed in early December to target any Israel-bound ship in the Red Sea, regardless of its ownership. They have attacked or harassed numerous ships, hijacked the MV Galaxy Leader in November and are holding its crew of 25 hostage. From bases along the Yemeni coast, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels have threatened ships in the Red Sea as they traverse the Bab el-Mandeb Straits, a narrow maritime choke point between the Arabian Peninsula and Africa. The majority of the world’s oil passes through the strait from the Indian Ocean towards the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea. Expectations of an Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon rose on Wednesday following comments by Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi and an announcement that the military was remobilizing two reservist brigades for the northern front. Immediately following a meeting of the Security Cabinet, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu departed for the US, where he is scheduled to address the opening session of the United General Assembly on Friday. Around 63,500 residents of northern Israel were forced to evacuate their homes when Hezbollah began launching rockets and drones in October. The terror group has launched more than 9,300 rockets and drones, killing 49 people on the Israeli side. Hezbollah leaders have repeatedly said they will continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. Israeli officials have been calling for Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from southern Lebanon in compliance with UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War.

‘I don’t care about Palestinian issue,’ says Saudi crown prince	Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, says he does not care about Palestinian statehood - but explains why Riyadh continues to insist on two-state solution regardless. By World Israel News Staff The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia has little interest personally in Palestinian statehood and would not link normalization of relations with Israel to the two-state, were it not for his concerns over how his nation's citizens relate to the issue, the prince admitted in a candid conversation with The Atlantic. Speaking with the magazine in an interview published last week, Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, heir apparent to the throne and prime minister who has served for years as de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom, shared his views on Palestinian statehood and its relation to attempts to normalize ties with the Jewish state. Prior to the Hamas invasion of southwestern Israel on October 7th of last year, Riyadh was engaged in talks with Washington for a comprehensive deal which would include increased American aid and support for a Saudi nuclear program, along with normalization of ties with Israel. Saudi Arabia has gradually softened its position vis-a-vis Israel, fueling speculation of formal recognition following the 2020 Abraham Accords, which established ties between Israel and several moderate Arab states. The Biden administration and Riyadh appeared on the verge of a breakthrough that would enable Israel and Saudi Arabia to establish formal relations for the first time in history, with Netanyahu reportedly vowing to the U.S. he would modify his governing coalition to ensure him backing for such a deal. Throughout the talks, the Saudis insisted that Palestinian statehood would be a necessary part of an deal with Israel - a condition that directly contradicted Netanyahu's stated policies and the position of his coalition allies. The Hamas invasion, however, and subsequent war in Gaza and burgeoning conflict between Israel and Hezbollah took a Saudi-Israel normalization deal off the table, with Riyadh issuing several sharp criticisms of Jerusalem over its handling of the war. Yet privately, bin Salman has expressed continued interest in normalizing ties with Israel, albeit after the current war in Gaza has ended. According to The Atlantic, when asked by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken what were the prerequisites for resuming efforts towards a normalization deal, bin Salman said that the war in Gaza must come to a conclusion and Israel leave Gaza. Bin Salman said he understood Israel might need to reenter the coastal enclave for security purposes at a later date, but said it could not occur close to any public moves towards normalization. 'They can come back in six months, a year, but not on the back end of my signing something like this,' bin Salman was quoted as saying. The Crown Prince emphasized that while he personally is uninterested in the Palestinian question, he is concerned by how the Israel-Palestinian conflict could enflame public opinion in his country, particularly should Riyadh commit to normalizing ties with Israel. 'Seventy percent of my population is younger than me,' bin Salman was quoted as saying. 'For most of them, they never really knew much about the Palestinian issue. And so they’re being introduced to it for the first time through this conflict. It’s a huge problem. Do I care personally about the Palestinian issue? I don’t, but my people do, so I need to make sure this is meaningful.' The Atlantic noted that a Saudi official later claimed that the report's description of bin Salman's comments was 'incorrect.'

Israel to launch ‘very limited ground invasion’ of Lebanon – repo...	Israeli troops on border say they're ready for ground incursion, want to fight to ensure Hezbollah is crushingly defeated. By World Israel News Staff A senior U.S. official said that Israel is preparing for a 'very limited ground invasion of Lebanon,' following the IDF calling up multiple reserve units and stationing thousands of troops on the northern border. According to an ABC News report, Jerusalem will soon order troops to enter southern Lebanon, in order to ensure that the region is free of Hezbollah terrorists and facilitate the return of displaced residents of northern Israel to their homes. A separate, later report from ABC indicated that the IDF may have already begun, or is about to begin, 'cross-border movements' on Sunday morning. Tropps would focus on targeting Hezbollah outposts directly adjacent to the Israel-Lebanon border, clearing the area of terrorists who aim anti-tank missiles and other short-range weaponry at communities and military assets in northern Israel. 20-year-old soldier Lior Papismadov told The Washington Post that Israeli troops 'are prepared for' a ground incursion, adding that 'we don’t know if it’s going to happen, but we are preparing.' 'Mobilization opens an option,' Assaf Orion, a former IDF head of strategic planning, told the Post. 'That allows whoever needs to decide, to take the action — and also sends a signal to the other side that this might be coming.' Orion said that an incursion would likely start off with intensive bombing of the region, in order to decrease the likelihood that troops on the ground will encounter terrorists. Then, he said, 'you will see the fence opening and forces moving [in.]' Nati Aroush, a reserve soldier mobilized to northern Israel, told the Post that he is ready to fight 'as long as needed.' Aroush stressed that the soldiers were willing to sacrifice in order to ensure that Hezbollah is decisively defeated. 'We want that it will be finished,' he said. 'That there will be quiet. That they won’t have an option to strike back.'

Kushner: US must tell Israel to ‘finish the job’ with Hezbollah	Donald Trump's son-in-law and long-time confidant Jared Kushner lauds Israel's assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, says US must encourage IDF to use the opportunity to strike mortal blow to Hezbollah. By David Rosenberg, World Israel News Former President Donald Trump's son-in-law and long-time advisor Jared Kushner praised Israel's recent offensive against the Iranian-backed Lebanese terror group Hezbollah, and called on the Biden administration to encourage Israel to 'finish the job' vis-a-vis the Iranian proxy. In a pair of tweets late Saturday night, Kushner, who served as senior advisor to the president during the Trump administration and was one of the architects of the 2020 Abraham Accords, wrote that the rapid series of blows delivered by the IDF and Mossad against Hezbollah's leadership had created a rare opportunity to cripple the organization. 'Moments like this come once in a generation, if they even come at all,' Kushner tweeted. 'The Middle East is too often a solid where little changes. Today, it is a liquid and the ability to reshape is unlimited. Do not squander this moment.' The 43-year-old businessman hailed Friday's assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah as 'the most important day in the Middle East' since the Abraham Accords normalized relations between Israel and moderate Arab states. 'There is not an expert on earth who thought that what Israel has done to decapitate and degrade them was possible,' Kushner continued. Not only have the attacks on Hezbollah's leadership - including the airstrikes killing much of the group's leadership and pager and radio bombings which killed or crippled thousands of officers and terror operatives - pushed the group to its nadir, Kushner argued, Hezbollah's decline has also deprived Iran of one of its key offensive assets. 'This is significant because Iran is now fully exposed. The reason why their nuclear facilities have not been destroyed, despite weak air defense systems, is because Hezbollah has been a loaded gun pointed at Israel. Iran spent the last forty years building this capability as its deterrent.' Calling the degradation of Hezbollah's capabilities a 'silver lining' to the fighting since last October, Kushner hailed Israel's 'brilliant, rapid-fire tactical successes' which have left the terror group's military assets 'unguarded and unmanned.' 'Iran is reeling, as well, insecure and unsure how deeply its own intelligence has been penetrated. Failing to take full advantage of this opportunity to neutralize the threat is irresponsible.' Kushner urged the Biden administration to encourage Israel to 'finish the job,' a tacit critic of the White House's recent efforts in conjunction with the Macron government to secure a ceasefire and avoid an Israeli ground operation into southern Lebanon. 'The right move now for America would be to tell Israel to finish the job. It’s long overdue. And it’s not only Israel’s fight.'

‘Volatile situation’ – US orders diplomats’ families to leave Leb...	US Embassy orders employees, families of staff to leave Lebanon; ambassador and critical embassy not yet evacuated. By World Israel News Staff The American embassy in Beirut has ordered the mandatory evacuation of the families of diplomats stationed in Lebanon, as well as instructed non-essential embassy workers to leave the country. Citing the 'volatile and unpredictable security situation' in Lebanon’s capital, the State Department urged all of its employees and their loved ones - except for critical embassy workers and diplomats - to flee from Lebanon, In a statement released Saturday, the State Department reiterated its call for U.S. citizens to 'depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available.' The order was made less than a day after the Israeli Air Force's Friday night strike on Hezbollah military headquarters in the Dahiyeh quarter of south Beirut. That strike, which involved the use of numerous bunker-busting bombs, killed Hezbollah Chief Hassan Nasrallah, along with other members of the terror group's senior leadership. The U.S.'s push to ensure that Americans leave the country indicates that Washington believes further deterioration in Lebanon's security is inevitable. While Iran, Hezbollah's patron, has so far shied away from becoming directly involved in the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, Nasrallah's slaying may trigger a response from Tehran. Iran invested billions of dollars in funding, training, and arming Hezbollah, which served as their largest and most intimidating proxy group on Israel's borders. As Israel's military campaign against Hezbollah intensified, the terror group reportedly turned to its patron for help, asking Iran to strike Israel. Tehran reportedly refused that request, claiming that the timing for such an attack 'was not right.' A senior Iranian commander, Brig. Gen. Abbas Nilofouroshan, was also killed in Friday night's bombing. Nilofouroshan is one of the most senior Iranian military officials assassinated by Israel since the outbreak of the war last year.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News A black-turbaned cleric and cousin of Hasan Nasrallah, who is head of the terror group's executive council, Hashem Safieddine, is most likely to become the next leader of Hezbollah after Nasrallah's killing on Friday. Hasan Nasrallah, who led the Lebanese terror group for 32 years, was killed in an underground area of a building in Beirut where the terror group was embedded. Safieddine, a maternal cousin of Nasrallah, is a cleric who wears a black turban, indicating direct descent from Mohammed. As head of the executive council, Safieddine is in charge of the political affairs of the terror group. He also has a seat on the Judicial Council which controls military operations. The US State Department designated Hashem Safieddine as a terrorist in 2017. He has strong ties with Iran and completed religious studies in Qom. Safieddine's son is married to the daughter of IRGC General Qasem Soleimani, who was killed in a 2020 airstrike in Iraq. At the funeral of a Hezbollah commander, Safieddine threatened Israel when he exclaimed, 'Let [the enemy] prepare himself to cry and wail.' He has expressed strong solidarity with the Palestinian cause and its struggle with Israel. At an event in Dahiyeh in Beirut, he said, 'Our history, guns, and rockets are with you.' In a speech in Beirut in July, Safieddine discussed Hezbollah's view of succession when he said, 'In our resistance&#8230; when any leader is martyred, another takes up the flag and goes on with new, certain, strong determination.' Phillip Smyth, an expert who studies Iran-backed Shiite terrorist organizations, said Nasrallah 'started tailoring positions for him within a variety of different councils within Lebanese Hezbollah. Some of them were more opaque than others. They've had him come, go out, and speak.' Safieddine had harsh words for the US, and in 2017, he said, 'This mentally impeded, crazy US administration headed by [Donald] Trump will not be able to harm the resistance.

The operation was complex because it required planning, precision and secrecy to prevent Hezbollah from discovering Israel's plans. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The strike on Friday that killed Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah required long-term planning and coordination of 'precise intelligence,' according to the IDF. The afternoon operation was carried out by fighter jets that targeted Hezbollah's 'central headquarters,' which were 'embedded under a residential building' in a suburb of Beirut. This area has long been a stronghold of the Lebanese terror group. Hasan Nasrallah assumed the leadership of Hezbollah 30 years ago. He was responsible, with the help of Iran, for the growth of the terror group to one of the largest non-state militaries in the region. . In a statement Saturday, Israeli Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said Nasrallah's killing proved that 'anyone who threatens the citizens of Israel — we will know how to reach them.' Brig.-Gen. Amichai Levine, the newly appointed commander of Hatzerim Airbase, said the mission to eliminate Nasrallah required the Israeli Air Force's unique, world-class capabilities. The operation was complex because it required planning, precision, and secrecy to prevent Hezbollah from discovering Israel's plans. 'The operation succeeded perfectly,' Levine said and credited the ground crews and technical teams for the smooth execution. The teams were responsible for ensuring the readiness of the aircraft and managing the munitions. He added, 'About a hundred munitions were used, with bombers dropping them every two seconds in perfect precision.' Levine credited the 69th Squadron, known as the 'Hammers,' which operates F-15I Ra’am fighter jets and has carried out a number of crucial operations in Lebanon and Syria. He added that for the last 11 months, the 69th Squadron's regular and reservist pilots have been on constant alert for missions across the Middle East. Levine said, 'We executed a historic operation of immense strategic importance. Nasrallah is seen as the most central figure in the Shi’ite axis.' He explained, 'This will significantly impact the Middle East and move us closer to achieving our war goals. The operation was long planned and reflects extraordinary collaboration with the Military Intelligence Directorate and the Air Force. I know all the intelligence officers who contribute incredible capabilities.'

Biden calls the Israeli strike killing Hezbollah’s Nasrallah a ‘m...	Biden also noted that Hezbollah under Nasrallah’s watch has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans. By The Associated Press President Joe Biden on Saturday called the Israeli strike that killed Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah a 'measure of justice' for his four-decade reign of terror. The comments came after Lebanon’s Hezbollah group confirmed earlier Saturday that Nasrallah, one of the group’s founders, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous day. Biden noted that the operation to take out Nasrallah took place in the broader context of the conflict that began with Hamas’ massacre of Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023. 'Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a ‘northern front’ against Israel,' Biden said in a statement. He also noted that Hezbollah under Nasrallah’s watch has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans. The White House sees the death of Nasrallah as a huge blow to the group. At the same time, the administration has sought to tread carefully as it has tried to contain Israel ‘s war with Hamas, which, like Hezbollah, is backed by Iran, from exploding into an all-out regional conflict. The White House and Pentagon were quick on Friday, shortly after the strike, to say publicly that Israel offered it no forewarning of the operation. The confirmation of Nasrallah’s death comes during a week that began with Biden’s top national security aides working on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly to build support for a 21-day Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire that they hoped might also breathe new life into stalled efforts to secure a truce in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a defiant speech Friday to the United Nations, vowing to keep up operations against Hezbollah until tens of thousands of Israeli citizens displaced by rocket attacks can return home. Shortly after, Israel carried out the strike killing Nasrallah. Biden reiterated on Saturday that he wants to see cease-fires both in Gaza and between Israel and Hezbollah. 'It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability,' Biden said. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian accused the United States of supporting the killing that took out Nasrallah and several other commanders. 'The world community will not forget that the order of the terrorist strike was issued from New York and the Americans cannot absolve themselves from complicity with the Zionists,' Pezeshkian was quoted as saying in a statement read on Iranian state television. The State Department on Saturday ordered the departure of the families of U.S. diplomats who are not employed by the embassy in Beirut and authorized the departure of those who are, as well as nonessential employees because of 'the volatile and unpredictable security situation' in Lebanon’s capital. The move comes after an Israeli strike on Friday killed the leader of the Hezbollah terrorist group, intensifying the fighting along another front of war, this time between Israel and Hezbollah. The State Department has previously advised American citizens to consider leaving Lebanon and reiterated its warning against all travel to the country. 'Due to the increased volatility following airstrikes within Beirut and the volatile and unpredictable security situation throughout Lebanon, the U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available,' the department said in a statement Saturday. The State Department routinely orders or authorizes the departure of nonessential embassy staffers and the families of diplomats when security conditions deteriorate in the country where they are posted. An ordered departure is not technically an evacuation but does require those affected to leave. An authorized departure allows those affected to leave the country voluntarily at government expense.

By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to the United Nations General Assembly on Friday 'was part of a diversion' to lull Hezbollah secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah into a false sense of security, a senior Israeli official told the Telegraph. The Israeli prime minister’s address, and visit to New York, was 'intended to make Hezbollah’s leader believe that Israel would not take dramatic actions while Netanyahu was physically in the United States,' the Telegraph reported, citing the unnamed Israeli official. Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.) shared a post suggesting the talk was a 'diversion.' 'The United Nations is finally good for something,' the congressman wrote.

Hezbollah confirms its leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an I...	Israel’s Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said Saturday that the elimination of Nasrallah was 'not the end of our toolbox,' indicating that more strikes were planned. By The Associated Press Lebanon’s Hezbollah group confirmed on Saturday that its leader and one of its founders, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous day. A statement said Nasrallah 'has joined his fellow martyrs.' Hezbollah vowed to 'continue the holy war against the enemy and in support of Palestine.' Nasrallah, who led Hezbollah for more than three decades, is by far the most powerful target to be killed by Israel in weeks of intensified fighting with Hezbollah. The Israeli military said it carried out a precise airstrike on Friday while Hezbollah leaders were meeting at their headquarters in Dahiyeh, south of Beirut. The Lebanese Health Ministry said six people were killed and 91 injured in the strikes, which leveled six apartment buildings. Ali Karki, the commander of Hezbollah’s Southern Front, and other commanders were also killed, the Israeli military said. Iran announced Saturday that a prominent general in its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard sanctioned by the U.S. died in the same airstrike. Abbas Nilforushan, 58, who the U.S. identified as the deputy commander for operations in the Guard, was killed Friday, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported. The recent strikes in Lebanon and the assassination of Nasrallah are a significant escalation in the war in the Middle East, this time between Israel and Hezbollah. Air raid sirens sounded across central Israel on Saturday afternoon, including at the Tel Aviv International Airport, shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu landed after a trip to the U.S. The Israeli military said it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen. It was not immediately known if the missile strike was aimed at Netanyahu’s flight. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli army spokesperson, said the airstrike Friday in Beirut was based on years of tracking Nasrallah along with 'real time information.' He declined to say what munitions were used or provide an estimate on civilian deaths. He said Israel takes measures to avoid civilians whenever possible. The Palestinian terrorist group Hamas in a statement issued condolences to its ally, Hezbollah. Nasrallah frequently described launching rockets against northern Israel as a 'support front' for Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza. It said 'assassinations will only increase the resistance in Lebanon and Palestine in determination and resolve.' Immediately after the confirmation from Hezbollah, people starting firing in the air in Beirut and across Lebanon to mourn Nasrallah’s death. 'Wish it was our kids, not you, Sayyid!' said one woman, using an honorific title for Nasrallah, as she clutched her baby in the western city of Baabda. News of Nasrallah’s killing stunned travelers at Lebanon’s only international airport, where hundreds of people were scrambling to leave the country despite limited flights. Some cried. Others talked on their phones in disbelief. One woman screamed: 'No! It was just an announcement! No, he didn’t die!' Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Tehran after Nasrallah’s killing was announced. Protesters chanted 'Death to Israel' and 'Death to Netanyahu the murderer' while waving Hezbollah flags. Thomas Juneau, a professor at the University of Ottawa’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, said Iran will be under significant pressure to respond to Nasrallah’s killing without escalating violence in the region. 'At the same time, Iran is severely constrained in its ability to respond,' Juneau told The Associated Press. 'Iran understands that its military options are limited, given the conventional military superiority of Israel and the U.S.' Israel vows to keep up attacks on Hezbollah Israel’s Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said Saturday that the elimination of Nasrallah was 'not the end of our toolbox,' indicating that more strikes were planned. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant called it 'the most important targeted strike since the founding of the State of Israel.' Israel has vowed to step up pressure on Hezbollah until it halts its attacks that have displaced tens of thousands of Israelis from communities near the Lebanese border. The recent fighting has also displaced more than 200,000 Lebanese in the past week, according to the United Nations. The military said Saturday it was mobilizing three more battalions of reserve soldiers to serve across the country. It already sent two brigades to northern Israel to prepare for a possible ground invasion. Shoshani, the army spokesperson, said Israel has inflicted heavy damage on Hezbollah’s capabilities over the past week by targeting immediate threats and strategic weapons, such as larger, guided missiles. But he said much of Hezbollah’s arsenal remains intact and that Israel would continue to target the group. The Israeli military updated guidelines for Israeli citizens, canceling gatherings of more than 1,000 people due to the threat. Approximately 60,000 Israelis have been evacuated from their homes along the Lebanese border for almost a year. This month, Israel’s government said halting Hezbollah’s attacks in the country’s north to allow residents to return to their homes is an official goal. A year of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah Hezbollah started firing rockets on Israel in support of Gaza on Oct. 8, a day after Hamas terrorists launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and abducting another 250. Since then, the two sides have been engaged in escalating cross-border strikes. Earlier this month, thousands of explosives hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah detonated, killing dozens of people and maiming thousands, including many civilians. Israel is widely believed to be behind the attack. Israel has killed several other top Hezbollah commanders in Beirut, especially in the past two weeks, in addition to the attack that killed Nasrallah. A window of opportunity for Israel and Lebanon Orna Mizrahi, a senior researcher at the Tel Aviv-based think tank Institute for National Security Studies and former intelligence analyst for the Israeli military and prime minister’s office, noted that Nasrallah was sometimes a 'voice of reason,' interested in engaging Israel in a war of attrition and holding the terrorist group back from using the full force of their formidable arsenal against Israel. Nasrallah’s death could prompt some less senior members of Hezbollah to unleash much stronger weapons than have been used in the nearly yearlong exchange of hostilities, Mizrahi said. The biggest question mark right now, though, is how Iran will respond. She said Nasrallah’s death could provide a window of opportunity — while the organization is significantly weakened — for Lebanon to dilute Hezbollah’s influence, especially in the south, that threatens to drag Lebanon into a full-scale war with Israel. Continuing strikes on both sides of the border On Saturday morning, the Israeli military carried out more than 140 airstrikes in southern Beirut and eastern Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, including targeting a storage facility for anti-ship missiles in Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh. Israel said the missiles were stored beneath civilian apartment buildings. Hezbollah launched dozens of projectiles across northern and central Israel and deep into the Israel-occupied West Bank, damaging some buildings in the northern town of Safed. In Beirut’s southern suburbs, smoke rose and the streets were empty after the area was pummeled overnight by heavy Israeli airstrikes. Shelters set up in the city center for displaced people were overflowing. Many families slept in public squares and on beaches or in their cars. On the roads leading to the mountains above the capital, hundreds of people could be seen fleeing on foot, holding infants and whatever belongings they could carry. A total of 1,030 people — including 156 women and 87 children — have been killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon in less than two weeks, the country’s health minister said Saturday.

US agency announces sanctions against Iran-connected company and ...	According to the Department of Treasury, Iranian state actors have attempted to 'gain access to individuals with direct access to the presidential campaigns' to exercise 'influence' over the American elections. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner The United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced Friday sanctions on 7 individuals, US officials say are tied to Iranian efforts to influence the American 2024 presidential election. In a Friday statement, the Department of Treasury claims that Iranian 'state actors' engaged in a number of activities, such as hack-and-leak operations and spear-phishing, to impact American elections. The agency says that these individuals have attempted to 'undermine confidence in the United States’ election processes and institution .' Thus, the U.S. government will block 'all property and interests' belonging to the implicated parties. 'The U.S. government continues to closely monitor efforts by malicious actors to influence or interfere in the integrity of our elections,' said Bradley T. Smith, the Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. 'Treasury, as part of a whole-of-government effort leveraging all available tools and authorities, remains strongly committed to holding accountable those who see to undermine our institutions.' Government agencies first acknowledged Iranian attempts to create instability among the American public in the summer of 2024, amid a deluge of demonstrations condemning Israel’s response to the Oct. 7 Hamas slaughters of roughly 1200 people across the Jewish state. According to the Department of Treasury, Iranian state actors have attempted to 'gain access to individuals with direct access to the presidential campaigns' to exercise 'influence' over the American elections. The agency alleges that government actors for Iran, the chief global sponsor of terrorism, have utilized 'hacking' attacks to impact the upcoming elections. According to the agency, Iranian agents have engaged in 'cyber-enabled operations' during the 2020 and 2024 presidential elections in the U.S. Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) members have gained unauthorized access to multiple accounts belonging to high-ranking members of a 2024 presidential campaign. These agents subsequently leaked the information to the media in an effort to influence electoral outcomes. The agents reportedly used 'technical infrastructure' tied to Masoud Jalili, an actor with reported IRGC ties. OFAC also claims that six employees and executives of Emennet Pasargad, an Iran-based cybersecurity firm, implemented an 'online operation to intimidate and influence American voters.' The individuals—Fatemeh Sadeghi, Elaheh Yazdi, Sayyed Mehdi Rahimi Hajjiabadi, Mohammad Hosein Abdolrahimi, and Rahmatollah Askarizadeh—accomplished this through sending 'threatening emails to intimidate voters.' In April, a confidential document leak indicated that the IRGC has helped plan a litany of anti-Israel protests in the United States. Iran’s support for anti-Israel demonstrations in the United States is well documented. The regime’s so-called 'supreme leader,' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has repeatedly heaped praise on anti-Israel protesters, referring to the demonstrations as a 'courageous, humane resistance movement.' He has also commended the protesters as a 'branch of the Resistance Front' against Israel. Flags representing Hamas and Hezbollah, another Iranian-backed terrorist group — have regularly appeared at anti-Israel demonstrations across the United States.

IDF: Hassan Nasrallah is dead	The commander of Hezbollah’s terror activities in Southern Lebanon, Ali Karaki, was also killed in the attack. Karaki, the Iranian proxy’s No. 3 terrorist, had narrowly evaded an Israeli targeted killing attempt earlier this week. By Charles Bybelezer, JNS Terror master Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israel Defense Forces strike on Hezbollah’s headquarters in Beirut, the military confirmed on Saturday. There was no immediate official reaction from the Lebanese government, but a source close to Hezbollah said contact with him had been 'lost.' Several hours later, Hezbollah confirmed Nasrallah’s death. pic.twitter.com/mv9IXNSxih &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) September 28, 2024 The Israeli Air Force conducted the massive airstrike targeting the headquarters, built underground beneath residential buildings, in the heart of the Dahiyeh district of the Lebanese capital on Friday evening. The operation to assassinate Nasrallah was named 'New Order.' The commander of Hezbollah’s terror activities in Southern Lebanon, Ali Karaki, was also killed in the attack. Karaki, the Iranian proxy’s No. 3 terrorist, had narrowly evaded an Israeli targeted killing attempt earlier this week. On Saturday, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei was transferred to a location with heightened security, Reuters reported, citing two regional officials. Beforehand, Khamenei called on Muslims to 'stand by the people of Lebanon and the proud Hezbollah with whatever means they have and assist them in confronting the … wicked regime [of Israel],' according to a statement carried by Iranian state media. 'The fate of this region will be determined by the forces of resistance, with Hezbollah at the forefront,' he added. Khamenei convened on Friday night an emergency session of the Supreme National Security Council to discuss a response, according to The New York Times. Iran’s embassy in Lebanon condemned the strike on Nasrallah and vowed to 'bring its perpetrator an appropriate punishment. 'This reprehensible crime … represents a dangerous escalation that changes the rules of the game,' stated the mission. In a separate strike, the IDF killed Mohammed Ismail, the commander of Hezbollah’s missile array in Southern Lebanon, the military announced on Saturday. He was responsible for numerous attacks, including Wednesday’s ballistic missile launch at Tel Aviv. 'The is not the end of the tools in the toolbox,' said IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi of the targeted killings. 'The message is simple, to anyone who threatens the citizens of the State of Israel, we will know how to get to them.' הרמטכ״ל מפקד על מבצע ״סדר חדש״ לחיסול מנהיג חיזבאללה, חסן נסראללה, בבור חיל האוויר עם חברי פורום המטה הכללי pic.twitter.com/htpEYxpmp3 &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) September 28, 2024 War against Hezbollah rages Earlier on Saturday, the IDF called on Lebanese civilians to evacuate from several buildings in Dahiyeh, a known Hezbollah stronghold, as the Israeli Air Force carried out waves of strikes across Lebanon. Among the targets were weapons manufacturing and storage facilities, along with a Hezbollah command center, in Beirut, as well as other terrorist infrastructure in the Beqaa Valley in the country’s east. 'The terrorist organization Hezbollah and its leader Hassan Nasrallah joined the war against the State of Israel on Oct. 8. Since then, Hezbollah has continued its attacks against the citizens of the State of Israel, and has dragged the State of Lebanon and the entire region into escalation,' the IDF said in a statement released on Saturday. 'The IDF will continue to harm anyone who promotes and engages in terrorism against the citizens of the State of Israel,' it added. במהלך הלילה, מטוסי קרב של חיל האוויר, תקפו בהכוונת פיקוד הצפון מבנים בהם אוחסנו אמצעי לחימה, משגרים שכוונו לעורף מדינת ישראל ומבנים צבאיים בהם פעלו מחבלים מארגון הטרור חיזבאללה >> pic.twitter.com/XgDgptrN08 &mdash; צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) September 28, 2024 Meanwhile, Hezbollah continued on Saturday to pummel the Jewish state with rocket fire, with a surface-to-surface missile launched from Lebanon hitting an open area in central Israel, the IDF said. In accordance with protocol, air raid sirens were not triggered, as the projectile was not headed for populated areas. Hezbollah also fired a volley of Fadi-1 rockets at Kibbutz Kabri in the Western Galilee, as well 10 rockets towards Safed in the Eastern Galilee. Additionally, a long-range missile struck in Samaria, reportedly hitting a Palestinian home in Hawara, near Nablus. There were no reports of injuries. U.S.-led ceasefire push Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who delivered a defiant speech on Friday morning in New York City during the 79th Session of the U.N. General Assembly, cut his trip short and was en route back to Israel, making the exceedingly rare decision to fly on Shabbat. Netanyahu has urged Lebanese citizens to rise up against Hezbollah while warning that the military would not hesitate to strike anywhere in Lebanon. 'I say to the people of Lebanon: Our war is not with you. Our war is with Hezbollah. Nasrallah is leading you to the edge of the abyss,' said Netanyahu on Tuesday after a visit to an intelligence base somewhere in Israel. 'I told you to evacuate homes in which there is a missile in the living room and a rocket in the garage,' he said. 'Whoever has a missile in the living room and a rocket in the garage will no longer have a home.' Nevertheless, Netanyahu said on Thursday that he 'shares the aim' of the U.S.-led diplomatic push to end the intensifying war with Hezbollah, speaking hours after insisting that the IDF would not back down amid reports of an imminent ceasefire. The United States, Australia, Canada, European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar called jointly on Wednesday night for an 'immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement.' Before the statement went out, U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron stated that 'it is time for a settlement on the Israel-Lebanon border that ensures safety and security to enable civilians to return to their homes.' Neither statement mentioned Hezbollah. IDF in escalation mode On Thursday, the IDF killed the head of Hezbollah’s aerial forces in an airstrike in Beirut’s Dahiyeh district. Senior terrorist Muhammad Hossein Sarur commanded numerous attacks with 'cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles launched at the Israeli home front,' the IDF said. On Tuesday, Israeli Air Force jets carried out another strike in Dahiyeh, killing Ibrahim Qubaisi, the commander of Hezbollah’s missile array. Last week, the IDF took credit for strike in Dahiyeh that killed more than a dozen senior Hezbollah terrorists, including Ibrahim Aqil, whom Washington also wanted for his involvement in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Beirut. Jerusalem has escalated strikes on Hezbollah since adding the return of evacuated Israeli civilians to the north as an official war goal on Sept. 17. Hezbollah has attacked Israel nearly daily since Oct. 8, firing some 9,000 rockets, missiles and drones. The attacks have killed more than 40 people and caused widespread damage. Tens of thousands of Israeli civilians remain displaced internally due to the violence.

By Vered Weiss, World Israel News The district of Progressive NY congresswoman and Squad member Alexandria Occasio-Cortez, popularly known as AOC, has become a crime-ridden red-light district where legitimate business owners and respectable citizens have to flee. Roosevelt Avenue in Queens, once known as a community of hardworking immigrants, has devolved into a trash-filled area characterized by prostitution and illegal scam businesses, to the chagrin of people who have lived in the neighborhood for years. Ramses Frias, a local activist, is angry at the deterioration of his neighborhood and told Fox News, 'It feels like Bangkok with women outside locations and pulling men off the street.' However, AOC has not been seen in the neighborhood where she once focused her campaign since August 2023, when she sharply criticized law enforcement for cracking down on illegal vendors. Frias said, 'She does not visit this area. This is actually an area where she campaigned the hardest, and a lot of people went out [to vote] for her, and she doesn't come over here. She has totally neglected us.' When FoxNews contacted AOC's office for comments, she did not reply. Roosevelt Avenue in Queens is now known sardonically as 'The Avenue of Sweethearts,' where children going to school and people coming home from work have to pass scores of prostitutes on any given night. This occurs in the heart of the Queens borough, underneath the area's main subway track, which connects it to Manhattan. Illegal vendors sell their wares and elbow out legitimate, tax-paying businesses. One business owner spoke to FoxNews on condition of anonymity, lest the violent pimps and madams take revenge on the shop owner for talking to the media about the situation. He said, 'I'm so scared. This is my business. ' He added that customers are now avoiding his store, and he may need to close. Frias lamented, 'This doesn't feel like my home. I've been here my whole life, and it feels like I'm a tourist in a Third World country. This is not how this is supposed to look; this is not how it's supposed to feel.' He added, 'This is a neighborhood and a community full of hardworking individuals, immigrants, and second-generation Americans that worked really hard to be here and are facing all this evil and all these bad things. &#8230; And it's just causing more issues daily, and our quality of life just continues to drop.'

IDF eliminates several Hezbollah commanders in Beirut	These terrorist commanders had worked for Hezbollah for years and were crucial to the planning and execution of the terror group's attacks against Israel. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News In a series of strikes in Beirut, the IDF eliminated several terrorist commanders this week who played crucial roles in Hezbollah. In addition to killing Ibrahim Muhammad Qabisi, Head of Hezbollah's Missiles and Rockets Force, the IDF announced on Friday that several others were also eliminated in the same operation. Qabisi's deputy, Abbas Ibrahim Sharaf Ad-Din, and a senior terrorist from Hezbollah's missile unit, Hussein Hany, a close friend of Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah's head of Hezbollah's Strategic Unit eliminated in July, were also killed in the strike. Fuad Shafiq Khaz'al Khanafer, who played a crucial role in Hezbollah's surface-to-surface missile unit, was also eliminated. These terrorist commanders had worked for Hezbollah for years and were central to the planning and execution of the terror group's attacks against Israel. 'The IDF will continue to operate with determination against the Hezbollah terrorist organization in order to restore security to the citizens of northern Israel and the State of Israel as a whole,' the IDF stated. On Thursday, the IDF eliminated the head of Hezbollah's aerial forces in an airstrike in Beirut's Dahiyeh district. The Israel Defense Forces on Thursday killed the head of Hezbollah’s aerial forces in an airstrike in Beirut’s Dahiyeh district. Senior Hezbollah terrorist Muhammad Hossein Sarur commanded numerous attacks with 'drone, cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles launched at the Israeli home front,' the IDF stated. Sarur also was a leader in drone production in Lebanon and established sites to construct explosive and intelligence-gathering drones 'including some located under civilian buildings in Beirut and other areas in Lebanon,' the Israeli army said. He joined Hezbollah in the 1980s and was part of the Azuz unit responsible for launching attacks from Lebanon to Israel. Hezbollah has attacked Israel nearly daily since Oct. 8, firing thousands of rockets, missiles, and drones. The attacks have killed more than 40 people and caused widespread damage.

Lebanese civilians are ‘praying for a ceasefire’	Israel has 'shattered the illusion' of Hezbollah as a resistance organization capable of defeating its enemies. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Despite Hezbollah's aggressive rhetoric, many Lebanese civilians are hoping for a ceasefire and dread a full-scale war with Israel that could further devastate the country. a Lebanese woman from the Keserwan district told Israel Hayom, 'We're praying for a ceasefire. The American and French mediators working towards a ceasefire have been utterly disappointing.' She added that she and many Lebanese hope that Hezbollah will cease launching missiles against Israel in solidarity with Hamas as they have been since October 8th. The nearly year-long conflict between Lebanon and Israel, initiated when Hezbollah fired rockets into Israeli territory after the October 7th massacre, has led to a refugee crisis affecting both Lebanon and Syria. The woman explained, 'Nobody is taking in refugees from the south except for Tripoli. Many have fled to Syria. In Christian areas, rents have skyrocketed. There are virtually no apartments available in my area. I've had to turn down over ten rental requests; we can't rent to strangers. I've heard that one town has converted a school into a shelter for the displaced.' According to the Saudi news channel Al-Hadath, 23,000 people have crossed the border into Syria, including 10,000 Syrians who sought refuge in Lebanon during the country's civil war. In addition to displacement, these refugees are vulnerable to kidnapping and robbery by gangs exploiting the conflict for financial gain. In total, it's estimated that 500,000 Lebanese are being displaced by a conflict that began when Hezbollah fired at Israel 11 months ago, and a full-scale war could make the situation worse. Lebanese researcher Joumana Gebara told Israel HaYom that Hezbollah has lost a lot of its former clout and influence with the Lebanese public. 'The organization has suffered both moral and physical damage, with the moral blow being particularly severe,' he said. Gerbara explained that Hezbollah has touted itself as a 'resistance organization' capable of fighting off all enemies, but 'Israel has shattered that illusion.'

By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that he 'shares the aim' of the U.S.-led diplomatic push to end the intensifying war with Hezbollah, just hours after insisting that the IDF would not back down amid reports of an imminent ceasefire. 'Due to a lot of misreporting around the U.S.-led ceasefire initiative, it is important to clarify a few points. Earlier this week, the United States shared with Israel its intention to put forward, together with other international and regional partners, a ceasefire proposal in Lebanon,' Netanyahu said. 'Israel shares the aims of the U.S.-led initiative of enabling people along our northern border to return safely and securely to their homes. Israel appreciates the U.S. efforts in this regard because the U.S. role is indispensable in advancing stability and security in the region,' continued the premier. 'Our teams met [on Thursday] to discuss the U.S. initiative and how we can advance the shared goal of returning people safely to their homes. We will continue those discussions in the coming days,' he added. Earlier, Netanyahu had pushed back against reports that Israel was about to agree to a ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon. 'The news about a ceasefire is incorrect. This is an American-French proposal that the prime minister has not even responded to,' his office said, while Netanayhu was en route to New York to speak at the United Nations General Assembly on Friday. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer—a close adviser to Netanyahu—was scheduled to meet with top U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on the sidelines of the summit. Sources in the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office cited by Israel’s Channel 12 News said that Dermer received a green light to continue negotiations. 'The report of an alleged instruction to moderate the fighting in the north is also contrary to the truth,' according to Netanyahu’s statement. 'The prime minister has instructed the IDF to continue the fighting with full force and according to the plans presented to him,' his office said. Minutes later, Foreign Minister Israel Katz posted to X: 'There will be no ceasefire in the north. We will continue to fight against the Hezbollah terrorist organization with all our strength until victory and the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes.' The statements came as Netanyahu’s coalition members rejected the U.S.-France proposal for a 21-day ceasefire. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who heads the Otzma Yehudit Party, vowed to leave the coalition government 'if the temporary ceasefire becomes permanent.' The United States, Australia, Canada, European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar called jointly on Wednesday night for an 'immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement.' Before the statement went out, U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron stated that 'it is time for a settlement on the Israel-Lebanon border that ensures safety and security to enable civilians to return to their homes.'

By JNS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that he 'shares the aim' of the U.S.-led diplomatic push to end the intensifying war with Hezbollah, just hours after insisting that the IDF would not back down amid reports of an imminent ceasefire. 'Due to a lot of misreporting around the U.S.-led ceasefire initiative, it is important to clarify a few points. Earlier this week, the United States shared with Israel its intention to put forward, together with other international and regional partners, a ceasefire proposal in Lebanon,' Netanyahu said. 'Israel shares the aims of the U.S.-led initiative of enabling people along our northern border to return safely and securely to their homes. Israel appreciates the U.S. efforts in this regard because the U.S. role is indispensable in advancing stability and security in the region,' continued the premier. 'Our teams met [on Thursday] to discuss the U.S. initiative and how we can advance the shared goal of returning people safely to their homes. We will continue those discussions in the coming days,' he added. Earlier, Netanyahu had pushed back against reports that Israel was about to agree to a ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon. 'The news about a ceasefire is incorrect. This is an American-French proposal that the prime minister has not even responded to,' his office said, while Netanayhu was en route to New York to speak at the United Nations General Assembly on Friday. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer—a close adviser to Netanyahu—was scheduled to meet with top U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on the sidelines of the summit. Sources in the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office cited by Israel’s Channel 12 News said that Dermer received a green light to continue negotiations. 'The report of an alleged instruction to moderate the fighting in the north is also contrary to the truth,' according to Netanyahu’s statement. 'The prime minister has instructed the IDF to continue the fighting with full force and according to the plans presented to him,' his office said. Minutes later, Foreign Minister Israel Katz posted to X: 'There will be no ceasefire in the north. We will continue to fight against the Hezbollah terrorist organization with all our strength until victory and the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes.' The statements came as Netanyahu’s coalition members rejected the U.S.-France proposal for a 21-day ceasefire. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who heads the Otzma Yehudit Party, vowed to leave the coalition government 'if the temporary ceasefire becomes permanent.' The United States, Australia, Canada, European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar called jointly on Wednesday night for an 'immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement.' Before the statement went out, U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron stated that 'it is time for a settlement on the Israel-Lebanon border that ensures safety and security to enable civilians to return to their homes.' Neither of the two statements referred to Hezbollah.

Israel announces $8.7 billion US military aid package	This substantial investment will significantly strengthen critical systems, such as Iron Dome and David’s Sling,' the Israeli Ministry of Defense stated. By JNS Israel’s Ministry of Defense announced that it had secured an $8.7 billion military aid package from the United States on Thursday. According to the ministry, $3.5 billion of the money is for 'essential wartime procurement' and the remaining $5.2 billion is for air defense systems, including Iron Dome and David’s Sling. 'This substantial investment will significantly strengthen critical systems, such as Iron Dome and David’s Sling while supporting the continued development of an advanced high-powered laser defense system currently in its later stages of development,' the ministry stated. Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir, director general of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, led the negotiations in Washington on behalf of Yoav Gallant, the defense minister. The ministry said that Zamir’s trip to Washington reflects 'the ironclad commitment to Israel’s security, particularly in addressing regional security threats from Iran and Iranian-backed militias by ensuring Israel’s overall capabilities.' Washington provides Israel with $3.8 billion in annual military aid under the terms of a 10-year memorandum of understanding that the two countries signed in 2016. In April, U.S. President Joe Biden signed into law a supplemental aid package that included $14.3 billion in direct military aid to Israel on top of the annual aid. A U.S. Department of State spokesperson told JNS that the funding announced Thursday was derived from April’s supplemental foreign aid bill. 'This $8.7 billion comes from the $14-plus billion emergency supplemental Congress approved in April 2024, with $3.5 billion being initially announced in August 2024 and the remaining $5.2 billion being announced today,' wrote David Milstein, who advised Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s presidential campaign and worked for David Friedman, then U.S. ambassador to Israel. 'It has been months,' Milstein wrote. 'Why did the Biden-Harris administration take so long to transfer the money to Israel during this emergency?'

Irangate: Iran’s plan to stop Trump and elect Kamala	Unlike Russiagate, Irangate is real and has roots in the White House. By Daniel Greenfield, FrontPage Magazine In the last two months, Iran set up fake news sites to defame Trump and promote Kamala, hacked the Trump campaign and tried to pass stolen documents to the Harris-Walz campaign and its media allies, and finally plotted to assassinate former President Trump and his officials. These rather definite statements of Iran’s intentions in the presidential election have been dismissed with generic Russiagate buzzwords that describe the Islamic terrorist state as being out to 'destabilize and sow chaos'. When Iran hacked the Trump campaign, we were told that it was to 'sow chaos' and now that Trump has been briefed on the assassination threats, once again it’s been described as a plot to 'destabilize and sow chaos' in the United States. But if Iran is out to only 'sow chaos' then why isn’t it trying to assassinate Biden or Kamala? Where are the Iranian agents soliciting useful idiots to take a shot at current administration officials rather than former Trump administration officials? And why didn’t Iran hack into the Kamala campaign and then email the stolen files to the Trump-Vance campaign? Iran isn’t trying to 'sow chaos' which is a meaningless buzzword the intel community seem to have come up with to project its own nation building paradigm abroad onto American politics. The Islamic Republic is out to win. And it defines winning as Trump’s political defeat or death. America’s leading middle eastern enemy actively interfering in a presidential election ought to be bigger news than it is. The Clinton campaign spun Russia’s awkward efforts to recruit black nationalists into backing its Syria agenda after the election into the great Russiagate hoax complete with British ex-secret agents, micturating hookers in Moscow hotel rooms, secret bank internet connections and a multi-year investigation fronted by a senile former FBI boss. The revelation that Iran is trying to stop Trump and elect Kamala by any means occasions no more from the White House and the intel community than a reluctant briefing and some boilerplate prose about sowing chaos as if there is no motive or agenda to these activities. No one has brought ‘Irangate’ into being even though there’s more than enough materials. After September 11, Joe Biden suggested, 'this would be a good time to send, no strings attached, a check for $200 million to Iran.' Biden urged restoring an American diplomatic presence to Tehran where our diplomats had been held hostage and cutting off Radio Liberty broadcasts undermining the Iranian regime. Biden’s 2008 presidential campaign was backed by Iran Lobby figures and he believed that Iranian support was so vital to his campaign that he attacked Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for being insufficiently pro-Iran, and used his vote against designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the key player behind Hamas, Hezbollah and the murder of hundreds of American soldiers, as a terrorist organization to argue that he would make a better president. For Iran. After being part of an administration that provided Iran with the massive sanction relief and clearance that enabled it to build a massive missile arsenal and nuclear program, Biden left office and misappropriated classified documents involving Iran that he took home with him. Biden stayed loyal to the Iran Lobby and it to him. Iranian hackers with the IRGC tried to interfere in the 2020 presidential election to stop Trump and aid Biden. In the 2020 election, Jamal Abdi, the executive director of National Iranian American Council (NIAC) Action, often described as the Iran Lobby, was exposed as one of Biden’s biggest bundlers, and NIAC claimed its members had run phone banks and donated $385,000 to him. NIAC Action had endorsed Biden and celebrated the election outcome by declaring that, 'our long, national nightmare is almost over. AP has called the race for Joe Biden'. Iran’s president cheered Biden’s election win by expressing the hope that 'the next American administration will surrender to the Iranian nation.' The Islamic terror state leader was not to be disappointed. The Biden-Harris administration offered billions in sanctions relief to Iran while attempting to restore the failed nuclear deal with the terror state. It dropped support for the Saudi campaign against the Houthis in Yemen which allowed the Iran-backed terrorists to arm up and terrorize shipping in the Red Sea leading to 9 months of fighting in what has been described as the 'most intense combat since World War II' for the U.S. Navy. The Biden-Harris administration was filled with Iranian sympathizers and lobby figures, including Rob Malley, Biden’s envoy to Iran, under FBI investigation for mishandling classified information, whose actions were illegally covered up by State Department figures. It even brought in Ariane Tabatabai, an Iranian immigrant who had worked with the Iranian government to advise it and spread its propaganda, before working with Malley on the Iran negotiations, to act as a senior adviser to the Office of the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control, exactly where Tehran would have wanted her, before making her a Pentagon Chief of Staff. Over the next four years, the Biden-Harris administration gave Iran everything it wanted from endless sanctions relief to a hostage trade that not only freed Iranian agents but allowed them to remain and continue their activities inside the United States. This year the Biden administration was still at it, warning the British and French not to censure Iran at a vote in the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency despite its nuclear violations When the chopper carrying Iran’s previous president crashed, the Biden administration sent its condolences and Deputy UN Ambassador Robert Wood stood for a moment of silence in the memory of the leader of a regime that had recently been responsible for killing U.S. soldiers. The Biden-Harris administration now not only allowed sanctioned Iranian figures into the country but warned journalists away from filming outside the hotel where the Iranian delegation was staying. What did their cameras catch? The former head of NIAC, the Iran Lobby group linked to the Biden-Harris administration, entering the hotel. Is it any wonder that when Iran hacked the Trump campaign, it sent the materials to Harris-Walz staffers who did not report it to the FBI? There is no shortage of materials for a theory of ‘Irangate’. The Biden-Harris administration has been even better for Iran that the previous low-water marks set by Carter and Obama. Iran is not trying to 'sow chaos' but to swing a presidential election in favor of its candidate. The Islamic regime has also had a longtime obsession with Trump ever since he approved the operation that took out the IRGC’s deadly terror boss Qasem Soleimani. Even with Trump out of office, the official website of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei published a video simulating a drone strike on Trump’s home with the message, 'Revenge is Inevitable' Unlike Russiagate, Irangate is real and has been taking place out in the open for us to see. An enemy of the United States is doing everything possible to stop a free election from taking place. It already used fake news, hacking and assassination plots to stop Trump. Those tactics are likely to pick up as Election Day approaches. Facing defeat in Gaza and Lebanon, Iran is not about to give up. And the most troubling question at the heart of Irangate that needs to be asked is how much support do Iran’s agents have inside this country, and inside the Biden-Harris administration and the intel community.

Ballistic missile launched from Yemen at central Israel	Millions of residents of central Israel rush to bomb shelters as ballistic missile from Yemen launched towards Tel Aviv metro area. By JNS Israel’s 'Arrow' defense system intercepted a surface-to-surface ballistic missile fired at the Jewish state from Yemen, the Israel Defense Forces stated early on Friday morning. The missile was downed 'outside [Israel’s] borders,' according to the military. 'Sirens and explosions were heard following the interception and falling shrapnel,' the IDF said. Some 15 minutes earlier, the IDF stated that 'millions of Israelis are running to shelter as sirens sound across all of central Israel.' The IDF Home Front Command said there was no change in directives for residents of the country’s center. On Sept. 15, Israeli air defenses intercepted fragments of a surface-to-surface missile launched from Yemen that exploded over central Israel. In July, a Houthi drone killed a man in Tel Aviv, in response to which Israel struck Yemen’s Hodeidah port. The Iranian terror proxy has launched dozens of drones and missiles at Israel in support of Hamas in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023. On Wednesday, the IDF intercepted a surface-to-surface ballistic missile fired by Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon at central Israel. Hezbollah claimed that the attack targeted the headquarters of the Mossad intelligence agency.

If Eric Adams steps down, New York City’s next acting mayor will ...	New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams expected to replace Mayor Eric Adams, should he resign over corruption scandal. By Corey Walker, The Algemeiner The next acting mayor of New York City might be a left-wing activist and staunch critic of the Jewish state. US prosecutors charged New York City Mayor Eric Adams on Thursday with soliciting illegal campaign contributions from foreign nationals and bribery. Adams’s potential departure from office could prove consequential for New York City’s estimated 960,000 Jewish residents, representing roughly 10 percent of the Big Apple’s population, and supporters of Israel living in the city. If Adams resigns as a result of the federal charges against him, New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams is widely expected to step into the mayoral role as his replacement. A review of Williams’s social media history reveals a pattern of denigrating Israel, raising questions over whether the public advocate would defend the city’s Jewish community. Williams has condemned Israel’s defensive military operations in Gaza as a 'war crime' and criticized the US Congress for inviting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak in July. 'Aside from basic humanity, under accepted [international] Law Benjamin Netanyahu is quite literally, at this moment, engaged in [international] war crimes/human rights violations,' Williams posted on X/Twitter at the time. 'Instead of Congress trying to stop it, they gave a platform.' Williams issued a statement on Oct. 11 of last year, four days after the Hamas terror group’s Oct. 7 massacre across southern Israel, lamenting the terrorist attacks on the Jewish state before calling on Jerusalem not to retaliate and shifting attention to alleged 'oppression' of Palestinians. 'We can, we have to be able to, at once grieve the hundreds of innocent lives taken in Israel, and oppose the escalating violence of retaliation, the endless war, the systemic violence and oppression of Palestinians too often ignored, excused, or condoned,' Williams wrote. On Oct. 14, one week after Hamas’s brutal slaughter of roughly 1,200 people in southern Israel, Williams condemned 'shameful' New York elected officials that 'won’t even mention [Palestine] or [Gaza].' Five days later, less than two weeks after the largest single-day mass-murder of Jews since the Holocaust, Williams called for an immediate 'ceasefire' between the Jewish state and the terrorist group. Israel had not yet launched its military offensive in neighboring Hamas-ruled Gaza to dismantle the terror group’s military capabilities and free the 251 hostages kidnapped from southern Israel on Oct. 7. He also drew an equivalency between Israel’s military operations to the Hamas atrocities. 'The moral compass of our leaders shows stunning irregularities,' Williams wrote on Instagram. 'On point in condemning horrendous attacks on Israel and demanding hostages be returned,' he added. '[Yet, failure] to recognize the [United Nation’s] description of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, let alone support de-escalation and ceasefire.' On Oct. 24, Williams declared Gaza a 'humanitarian crisis' and added that 'all of us who rightly condemned Oct 7 on Israel should be rightly demanding a [ceasefire] now and before any ground invasion.' Israel began striking Hamas targets after repelling the Oct. 7 invasion but did not launch a ground offensive into Gaza until Oct. 27. In February, Williams appeared at a press conference conducted by the 'NYC 4 Ceasefire' coalition to demand an end to Israel’s military operations in Gaza. During the event, participants referred to the Gaza war as a 'genocide' and honored Palestinian 'martyrs.' 'We have gathered here today to show city-wide support for an immediate and permanent ceasefire and end to the genocide in Palestine,' said Jawanza Williams, organizing director of left-wing activist group VOCALNY. Williams harbors ties to the vehemently anti-Israel Democratic Socialists of America group (DSA). In a 2018 interview with the left-wing media outlet Jacobin, Williams said, 'I have no problem saying I’m a Democratic Socialist.' Williams has solicited an endorsement from the group while running for office in New York City. DSA has routinely praised Hamas’s so-called 'armed struggle' against Israel. The group issued an explicit endorsement of Hamas, stating that the terrorist organization is a cornerstone in the 'resistance' against the 'Zionist project.' DSA has also accused Israel of committing 'genocide' and praised the Hezbollah terrorist group for attempting to pummel the Jewish state with missiles.

‘Temple Mount is Muslim-only property,’ Palestinian Authority chi...	The head of the Palestinian Authority also said that Israel doesn’t deserve membership in the world body, as he nods to anti-Israel protesters in America, saying 'we are grateful' to them. By Mike Wagenheim, JNS In an address to the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday morning, Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas called the holiest Jewish site—the Temple Mount in Jerusalem—the 'exclusive property of Muslims' and referred to Israel as a 'terrorist state' that does not deserve membership in the United Nations. Abbas, whose presidential mandate expired in 2009–the last time P.A. elections were held–told those watching that 'the world is responsible' for what he asserted were crimes against humanity taking place in the Gaza Strip amid Israel’s defensive war against Hamas. He claimed that Israel 'took advantage of what happened' on Oct. 7, when Hamas launched a massive assault in southern Israel—murdering, raping and torturing 1,200 people and taking some 250 others hostage—to 'launch a genocide' in the Gaza Strip. Abbas also said Israel has just launched a second 'war of genocide' in Lebanon, calling into question what kind of hostilities the Jewish state could be involved in that wouldn’t qualify as one. He also referred to Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir as a terrorist for calling for a Third Temple to be built on the mount. Abbas saved a heavy dose of criticism for the Biden administration. He said he 'regrets' that the White House 'furnished Israel with deadly weapons it used to kill thousands of innocent civilians' while utilizing its veto power in the U.N. Security Council three times to thwart efforts to force a ceasefire on Israel with no guarantee that its hostages would be released from Gaza. 'As long as the U.S. is supporting' Israel, posed Abbas, 'why not keep going?' He also took Washington to task for denying the Palestinians full membership in the United Nations. 'We don’t deserve membership in the eyes of America,' he stated. 'I don’t understand.' Abbas did acknowledge protesters across America who 'are marching in the streets.' Many of them have called for the end of Israel, including its inhabitants, and have expressed explicit support for terror groups; have harassed Jews verbally and physically; and have disrupted Jewish life, including on college campuses. 'We are grateful to them,' said Abbas. He laid out a 12-step laundry list of requests and demands for a 'day-after' scenario, referring to the end of the war against Hamas and end of the terror group’s governance of Gaza. Those measures have all been laid out in one form or another in various public statements by the P.A., the United Nations and other international officials. On that list was 'an end to military aggressions by terrorist settlers' in Judea and Samaria, and eastern Jerusalem. Abbas said he would be submitting a request to the General Assembly regarding what he said was Israel’s lack of qualification to hold U.N. membership. His citation for such a claim was unclear, as he referred to Israel’s acceptance of the 1947 U.N. Partition Plan, but provisions he said Israel has never accepted or implemented. He also said that he would ask the world body to pass a resolution to ensure that Israel does not obstruct a visit by Abbas to the Gaza Strip, which he says he is trying to arrange. Abbas did not fall back on Holocaust denial or revisionism—a staple of previous UNGA speeches. Israel sent what appeared to be a staffer from its U.N. mission to attend the speech. Danny Danon, Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations released a statement, pointing out that Abbas’s 26-minute speech contained no mention of Hamas. 'Since the massacre of Oct. 7, Abbas has failed to condemn Hamas for their crimes against humanity,' Danon wrote. 'The Palestinian Authority under his leadership pays salaries to terrorists who kill Israelis: Whoever kills more, Abbas pays him more. Only when he stands on the U.N. platform does he talk about a peaceful solution.' Danon said the P.A. leader’s legacy 'is one of chronic weakness in the face of terrorism and hatred.'

Trump ally accused of being a Nazi after he changed the price of ...	Whether Lindell realized it or not, $14.88 has been identified as a Nazi symbol. By Vered Weiss, World Israel News When staunch Trump ally Mike Lindell changed the price of his pillow to $14.88, he most likely didn't expect accusations of Nazism to follow. However, white Supremacists on social media began liking his prices, and not because they were low. When Lindell lowered the price of his Standard Classic MyPillow from its usual range of between $29.99 to $49.98 down to $14.88, people began to allege that he was sending a Nazi message. Whether Lindell realized it or not, $14.88 has been identified as a Nazi symbol. The number 14 stands for a white supremacist motto that contains 14 words. David Lane, a member of the white supremacist group The Order, originated the motto: 'We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.' The double eights refer to the fact that 'H' is the eighth letter of the alphabet, and 88 stands for 'Heil Hitler,' both words beginning with 'H.' Lindell's MyPillow ad received 8,000 likes on X and 415 likes on Facebook. Balkanomic reposted their order of the pillows, saying: '$14.88? How could you pass up such a great deal?' An X user called 'Goy division,' whose bio shows white supremacist symbolism (including a Nazi SS-esque lightning bolt and the phrase 'Fourteen words, eighty-eight precepts'), wrote, '6,000,000 positive reviews can't be wrong.' 'Yes, I think we have a deal,' wrote one user who refers to himself as an 'ethnostatesman' and posted a picture of Pepe the Frog, a well-known white supremacist symbol. However, Mike Lindell insists it wasn't his intention to signal white supremacy, and he points out that many items at Walmart are sold for amounts ending in 88 cents. Lindell has often expressed the view that the 2020 election was rigged in favor of Joe Biden, and for his views, his pillow brand has been removed from shelves of Bed, Bath and Beyond, Kohl's, and Walmart. 'When they have a sale on a sale, right? That 88,' he said on FlashPoint, a conservative online talk show. 'I get a call from all the media around the country and the world, all the way to the Daily Mail, saying, what are you, a Nazi?' He added, 'I'm going, 'Who comes up with this stuff?'' When asked if he would change his prices from $14.88, Lindell insisted he wasn't budging. 'It's another attack on MyPillow because their CEO wants to go to paper ballots and counting. It's as simple as that,' he said.

Israeli security forces foil terror plot to bomb Jewish holy site...	Security forces said the actions are 'are even more severe when being carried out by Israeli citizens during wartime.' By Vered Weiss, World Israel News Shin Bet, Israel's security agency and the police foiled a terrorist plan to bomb Jewish holy sites in the north of Israel last month and to shoot worshippers who prayed there. On Thursday, the agencies announced the arrest of Basel Abahara, a 23-year-old who lives in the Galilee region, and two minors in mid-August. This week, they were indicted for planning terrorist acts and keeping weapons. During interrogations, Abahara admitted that he had been planning to bomb the holy sites and then to shoot Jewish worshippers there. He also said he built the explosives based on advice from contacts in Judea and Samaria. Abahara enlisted the aid of minors to carry out the attack. Shin Bet said the planning of the attack was in the early phases, and they managed to seize communication devices, bomb-making materials, and a military vest. Abahara also admitted to throwing a Molotov cocktail not far from his home. Shin Bet said in a statement that the planning of such an attack was even more severe than usual because it involved 'Israeli citizens during wartime.' 'The Shin Bet and Israel Police treat any involvement of Israeli citizens in activity that endangers the state's and citizens' security with great severity, will continue to operate accordingly under the authority afforded to them, and will use the means at their disposal to thwart threats,' they said. Last Thursday, the IDF and Shin Bet eliminated a terror leader who planned numerous attacks in Northern Samaria. Shadi Zakarneh was killed alongside other terrorists by an IAF strike on his vehicle after Shin Bet saw him traveling in Qabatiya. The strike that killed Zkarneh also eliminated two other terrorists in the vehicle, and a strike on an additional vehicle killed three others. The second vehicle was laden with explosives, and the strike caused multiple blasts.
